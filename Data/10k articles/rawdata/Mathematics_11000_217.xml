The '''Academy ratio''' of 1.375:1 (abbreviated as 1.37:1) is an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of a [[frame (film)|frame]] of [[35mm film]] when used with [[negative pulldown|4-perf pulldown]].&lt;ref name="Monaco"&gt;Monaco, James. ''How to Read a Film: The Art, Technology, Language, History and Theory of Film and Media.'' Rev. ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 1981. {{ISBN|0-19-502806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmArt"&gt;Bordwell, David and Thompson, Kristin. ''Film Art: An Introduction.'' Rev. ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1993. {{ISBN|0-07-006446-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was standardized by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] as the standard film aspect ratio in 1932, although similar-sized ratios were used as early as 1928.&lt;ref name="Monaco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmArt" /&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|Widescreen#History}}
Silent films were shot at a 1.33 aspect ratio (also known as a 4:3 aspect ratio), with each frame using all of the negative space between the two rows of [[film perforations]] for a length of 4 perfs.&lt;ref name="Monaco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmArt" /&gt; The [[frame line]] between the silent film frames was very thin. When [[sound-on-film]] was introduced in the late 1920s, the soundtrack was recorded in a stripe running just inside of one set of the perforations and cut into the 1.33 image.&lt;ref name="Monaco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmArt" /&gt; This made the image area "taller", usually around 1.19, which was slightly disorienting to audiences used to the 1.33 frame and also presented problems for exhibitors with fixed-size screens and stationary projectors.

From studio to studio, the common attempt to reduce the image back to a 1.33:1 ratio by decreasing the projector aperture in-house met with conflicting results.  Each movie theater chain, furthermore, had its own designated house ratio.  The first standards set for the new sound-on-film motion pictures were accepted in November 1929, when all major US studios agreed to compose for the [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|Society of Motion Picture Engineers' (SMPE)]] designated size of {{convert|0.800|x|0.600|inch|abbr=on}} returning to the aspect ratio of 1.3{{overline|3}}:1.&lt;ref name="JSMPE Jan 1930"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofsociety14socirich#page/119/mode/2up | title=Camera and Projection Apertures | author=Cowan, Lester | journal=Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers |date=January 1930 | volume=XIV | issue=1 | pages=108–121 | oclc=1951231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS)]] considered further alterations to this 1930 standard.  Various dimensions were submitted, and the projector aperture plate opening size of 0.825&amp;nbsp;in × 0.600&amp;nbsp;in was agreed upon. The resulting 1.375:1 aspect ratio was then dubbed the "Academy Ratio". On May 9, 1932, the SMPE adopted the same {{convert|0.825|x|0.600|inch|abbr=on}} projector aperture standard.&lt;ref name="JSMPE July 1932"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofsociety19socirich#page/924/mode/2up | title=Society Announcements, New Dimensional Standards | journal=Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers |date=July 1932 | volume=XIX | issue=1 | pages=924 | oclc=1951231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All studio films shot in 35mm from 1932 to 1952 were shot in the Academy ratio.&lt;ref name="Monaco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmArt" /&gt; However, following the widescreen "revolution" of 1953, it quickly became an obsolete production format. Within several months, all major studios started [[Matte (filmmaking)|matting]] their non-anamorphic films in the [[movie projector|projector]] to wider ratios such as 1.66, 1.75, and 1.85, the last of which is still considered a standard ratio along with [[anamorphic]] (2.39).&lt;ref name="Monaco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmArt" /&gt; 1.37:1 is not totally obsolete, nonetheless, and can still be found in selected recent films such as [[Wes Anderson]]'s ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2278388/technical?ref_=tt_dt_spec&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Schrader]]'s ''[[First Reformed]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6053438/technical?ref_=tt_dt_spec&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Hazanavicius]]'s ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiodaily.com/2012/02/the-artists-cinematographer-speaks"''The-Artists-Cinematographer-Speaks.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gus Van Sant]]'s ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc47.2005/elephant/index.html Garry, John P. III. "''Elephant'': An Ordinary High School Movie. Except That It's Not." ''Jump Cut.'' #47 (Winter 2005).]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Arnold]]'s ''[[Fish Tank (film)|Fish Tank]]'', [[Kelly Reichardt]]'s ''[[Meek's Cutoff (film)|Meek's Cutoff]]'' and [[Paweł Pawlikowski]]'s ''[[Ida (film)|Ida]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://prettycleverfilms.com/movie-reviews/modern-times/tiff13-review-ida-2013/#.UmfeVnBJO-m&lt;/ref&gt;, as well on prints of [[Phil Lord]] and [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Christopher Miller]]'s ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' intended for 1.78:1 exhibition (a 2.39:1 version was also made).

== Technical details ==
The Academy ratio is not created in the camera, which has continued to use the [[full frame]] silent aperture gate for all 4-perf spherical filming.&lt;ref name="Monaco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmArt" /&gt; Rather, it is created in the [[married print]], when the optical soundtrack and [[frame line]]s are added. Though most non-anamorphic film prints with a soundtrack are now framed to one of the non-anamorphic widescreen ratios, from 1.66 to 1.85, some still retain Academy-sized frames.&lt;ref name="Monaco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmArt" /&gt; These frames are then cropped in the projector by means of aperture masks used in the projector's gate in conjunction with a wider lens than would be used for projecting Academy ratio films.&lt;ref name="Monaco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmArt" /&gt;

During filming, using the 4-perf frame for widescreen framing when spherical lenses are used is sometimes considered to be wasteful in terms of the cost of film stock and processing, especially in the case of television, which does not require a film print. The [[3-perf pulldown]] process was originally proposed in 1973, developed by [[Miklos Lente]] in 1976, and further developed by [[Rune Ericson]] in 1986 to solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, N.D.; Wysotsky, M.Z.; and Konoplev, B.N. "A Universal Format for Film Production." ''Journal of the SMPTE.'' September 1973; Lente, Miklos. "The Proposed Trilent-35 System." ''American Cinematographer.'' June 1976; Ericson, Rune. "Three-Perf in the Future." ''American Cinematographer.'' July 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4677">'''Adaptive sampling''' is a technique used in computational [[molecular biology]] to efficiently simulate [[protein folding]].

==Background==
Proteins spend a large portion – nearly 96% in some cases&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001"/&gt; – of their [[protein folding|folding]] time "waiting" in various [[thermodynamic free energy]] minima. Consequently, a straightforward simulation of this process would spend a great deal of computation to this state, with the transitions between the states – the aspects of protein folding of greater scientific interest – taking place only rarely.&lt;ref name="Simulation FAQ"/&gt; Adaptive sampling exploits this property to simulate the protein's [[phase space]] in between these states. Using adaptive sampling, molecular simulations that previously would have taken decades can be performed in a matter of weeks.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;

==Theory==
If a protein folds through the [[metastable state]]s A -&gt; B -&gt; C, researchers can calculate the length of the transition time between A and C by simulating the A -&gt; B transition and the B -&gt; C transition. The protein may fold through alternative routes which may overlap in part with the A -&gt; B -&gt; C pathway. Decomposing the problem in this manner is efficient because each step can be simulated in parallel.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;

==Applications==
Adaptive sampling is used by the [[Folding@home]] distributed computing project in combination with [[Hidden markov model|Markov state models]].&lt;ref name="Simulation FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;

==Disadvantages==
While adaptive sampling is useful for short simulations, longer trajectories may be more helpful for certain types of biochemical problems.&lt;ref name="10.1145/1364782.1364802"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1522">In [[applied mathematics]] as used in the engineering field of [[robotics]], an '''arm solution''' is a solution of equations that allow the calculation of the precise design parameters of a robot's arms in such a way as to enable it to make certain movements.

A typical [[industrial robot]] is built with fixed length segments that are connected either at joints whose [[angle]]s can be controlled, or along linear slides whose length can be controlled. If each angle and slide [[distance]] is known, the position and orientation of the end of the robot arm relative to the base can be computed with the simple [[trigonometry]] in [[robot control]]. 

Going the other way &amp;mdash; calculating the angles and slides needed to achieve a desired position and orientation &amp;mdash; is much harder. The mathematical procedure for doing this is called an '''arm solution'''. For some robot designs, such as the [[Stanford arm]], [[SCARA robot]] or [[cartesian coordinate robot]]s, this can be done in [[Closed-form expression|closed form]]. Other robot designs require an [[iterative method|iterative]] solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20063">In [[colloquial]] language, an '''average''' is a single number taken as representative of a list of numbers. Different concepts of average are used in different contexts. Often "average" refers to the [[arithmetic mean]], the sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers are being averaged. In statistics, mean, [[median]], and [[Mode (statistics)|mode]] are all known as [[measurement|measure]]s of [[central tendency]], and in colloquial usage any of these might be called an average value.

==Calculation==

===Arithmetic mean===
{{Main|Arithmetic mean}}
The most common type of average is the arithmetic mean. If ''  n ''    numbers are given, each number denoted by ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (where ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,2,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''n''), the arithmetic mean is the [[Summation|sum]] of the ''a''s divided by ''n'' or

:&lt;math&gt;AM = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^na_i = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

The arithmetic mean, often simply called the mean, of two numbers, such as 2 and 8, is obtained by finding a value A such that 2 + 8 = A + A. One may find that ''A'' =&amp;nbsp;(2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;8)/2 =&amp;nbsp;5. Switching the order of 2 and 8 to read 8 and 2 does not change the resulting value obtained for A. The mean 5 is not less than the minimum 2 nor greater than the maximum&amp;nbsp;8. If we increase the number of terms in the list to 2, 8, and 11, the arithmetic mean is found by solving for the value of ''A'' in the equation 2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;11 =&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''A''. One finds that ''A'' =&amp;nbsp;(2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;11)/3 =&amp;nbsp;7.

===Pythagorean means===
{{main|Pythagorean means}}
{{see also|Mean#Pythagorean means}}
Along with the arithmetic mean above, the geometric mean and the harmonic mean are known collectively as the Pythagorean means.

====Geometric mean====
The [[geometric mean]] of ''n'' positive numbers is obtained by multiplying them all together and then taking the ''n''th root.  In algebraic terms, the geometric mean of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as

: &lt;math&gt; GM= \sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^n a_i} = \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n}&lt;/math&gt;

Geometric mean can be thought of as the [[antilog]] of the arithmetic mean of the [[logarithm|logs]] of the numbers.

Example: Geometric mean of 2 and 8 is &lt;math&gt;GM = \sqrt{2 \cdot 8} = 4&lt;/math&gt;

====Harmonic mean====
[[Harmonic mean]] for a non-empty collection of numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, all different from 0, is defined as the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;{{'}}s:

: &lt;math&gt;HM = \frac{1}{\dfrac{1}{n}\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{a_i}} = \frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{a_n}}&lt;/math&gt;

One example where the harmonic mean is useful is when examining the speed for a number of fixed-distance trips. For example, if the speed for going from point ''A'' to ''B'' was 60&amp;nbsp;km/h, and the speed for returning from ''B'' to ''A'' was 40&amp;nbsp;km/h, then the harmonic mean speed is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\frac{1}{60} + \frac{1}{40}} = 48&lt;/math&gt;

====Inequality concerning AM, GM, and HM====
A well known inequality concerning arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means for any set of positive numbers is

: &lt;math&gt;AM \ge GM \ge HM&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to remember noting that the alphabetical order of the letters ''A'', ''G'', and ''H'' is preserved in the inequality. See [[Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]].

Thus for the above harmonic mean example: AM = 50, GM ≈ 49, and HM = 48&amp;nbsp;km/h.

===Statistical location===
The [[mode (statistics)|mode]], the [[median]], and the [[mid-range]] are often used in addition to the [[mean]] as estimates of [[central tendency]] in [[descriptive statistics]]. These can all be seen as minimizing variation by some measure; see {{slink|Central tendency|Solutions to variational problems}}.

====Mode====
[[Image:Comparison mean median mode.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of [[mean|arithmetic mean]], [[median]] and [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of two [[log-normal distribution]]s with different [[skewness]].]]
{{Main|Mode (statistics)}}
The most frequently occurring number in a list is called the mode. For example, the mode of the list (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4) is 3. It may happen that there are two or more numbers which occur equally often and more often than any other number. In this case there is no agreed definition of mode. Some authors say they are all modes and some say there is no mode.

====Median====
{{Main|Median}}
The median is the middle number of the group when they are ranked in order. (If there are an even number of numbers, the mean of the middle two is taken.)

Thus to find the median, order the list according to its elements' magnitude and then repeatedly remove the pair consisting of the highest and lowest values until either one or two values are left. If exactly one value is left, it is the median; if two values, the median is the arithmetic mean of these two. This method takes the list 1, 7, 3, 13 and orders it to read 1, 3, 7, 13. Then the 1 and 13 are removed to obtain the list 3, 7. Since there are two elements in this remaining list, the median is their arithmetic mean, (3 + 7)/2 = 5.

====Mid-range====
{{Main|Mid-range}}
The mid-range is the arithmetic mean of the highest and lowest values of a set.

==Miscellaneous types==

Other more sophisticated averages are: [[trimean]], [[trimedian]], and [[normalized mean]], with their generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Merigo |first1=Jose M. |last2=Cananovas |first2=Montserrat |title=The Generalized Hybrid Averaging Operator and its Application in Decision Making |year=2009 |journal=Journal of Quantitative Methods for Economics and Business Administration |volume=9 |pages=69–84 |issn=1886-516X |url=http://www.upo.es/RevMetCuant/art.php?id=38 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can create one's own average metric using the [[generalized f-mean|generalized ''f''-mean]]:

: &lt;math&gt;y = f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{n}\left[f(x_1) + f(x_2) + \cdots + f(x_n)\right]\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is any invertible function. The harmonic mean is an example of this using ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'', and the geometric mean is another, using ''f''(''x'') = log&amp;nbsp;''x''.

However, this method for generating means is not general enough to capture all averages.  A more general method&lt;ref name=Bibby/&gt; for defining an average takes any function ''g''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) of a list of arguments that is [[Continuous function|continuous]], [[Monotonicity|strictly increasing]] in each argument, and symmetric (invariant under [[permutation]] of the arguments). The average ''y'' is then the value that, when replacing each member of the list, results in the same function value: {{nowrap|1=''g''(''y'', ''y'', …, ''y'') =}} {{nowrap|''g''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.  This most general definition still captures the important property of all averages that the average of a list of identical elements is that element itself. The function {{nowrap|1=''g''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) =}} {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ ··· + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} provides the arithmetic mean. The function {{nowrap|1 = ''g''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) =}} {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;···''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (where the list elements are positive numbers) provides the geometric mean. The function {{nowrap|1 = ''g''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) =}} {{nowrap|−(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;+ ··· + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} (where the list elements are positive numbers) provides the harmonic mean.&lt;ref name=Bibby&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bibby | first1 = John | year = 1974 | title = Axiomatisations of the average and a further generalisation of monotonic sequences | url = | journal = [[Glasgow Mathematical Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 63–65 | doi=10.1017/s0017089500002135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Average percentage return and CAGR===
{{Main|Compound annual growth rate}}
A type of average used in finance is the average percentage return. It is an example of a geometric mean. When the returns are annual, it is called the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). For example, if we are considering a period of two years, and the investment return in the first year is −10% and the return in the second year is +60%, then the average percentage return or CAGR, ''R'', can be obtained by solving the equation: {{nowrap|1= (1 − 10%) × (1 + 60%) = (1 − 0.1) × (1 + 0.6) = (1 + ''R'') × (1 + ''R'')}}. The value  of ''R'' that makes this equation true is 0.2, or 20%. This means that the total return over the 2-year period is the same as if there had been 20% growth each year. Note that the order of the years makes no difference – the average percentage returns of +60% and −10% is the same result as that for −10% and +60%.

This method can be generalized to examples in which the periods are not equal. For example, consider a period of a half of a year for which the return is −23% and a period of two and a half years for which the return is +13%. The average percentage return for the combined period is the single year return, ''R'', that is the solution of the following equation: {{nowrap|1= (1 − 0.23)&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt; × (1 + 0.13)&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; = (1 + ''R'')&lt;sup&gt;0.5+2.5&lt;/sup&gt;}}, giving an average return ''R'' of 0.0600 or 6.00%.

==Moving average==
{{main|Moving average}}

Given a [[time series]] such as daily stock market prices or yearly temperatures people often want to create a smoother series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=George E.P. | last1= Box |first2=Gwilym M.| last2= Jenkins| title= Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control | edition= revised| publisher=Holden-Day | year=1976 | isbn=0816211043}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helps to show underlying trends or perhaps periodic behavior. An easy way to do this is the ''moving average'':  one chooses a number ''n'' and creates a new series by taking the arithmetic mean of the first ''n'' values, then moving forward one place by dropping the oldest value and introducing a new value at the other end of the list, and so on. This is the simplest form of moving average. More complicated forms involve using a [[weighted average]]. The weighting can be used to enhance or suppress various periodic behavior and there is very extensive analysis of what weightings to use in the  literature on [[Digital filter|filtering]]. In [[digital signal processing]] the term “moving average” is used even when the sum of the weights is not 1.0 (so the output series is a scaled version of the averages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Simon | last1= Haykin | title= Adaptive Filter Theory | publisher=Prentice-Hall | year=1986 | isbn=0130040525}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that the analyst is usually interested only in the trend or the periodic behavior.

==History==

===Origin===

The first recorded time that the [[arithmetic mean]] was extended from 2 to n cases for the use of [[estimation]] was in the sixteenth century. From the late sixteenth century onwards, it gradually became a common method to use for reducing errors of measurement in various areas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2333051 | volume=45 | title=Studies in the History of Probability and Statistics: VII. The Principle of the Arithmetic Mean | journal=Biometrika | pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="york.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/eisenhart.pdf Eisenhart, Churchill. "The development of the concept of the best mean of a set of measurements from antiquity to the present day." Unpublished presidential address, American Statistical Association, 131st Annual Meeting, Fort Collins, Colorado. 1971.]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, astronomers wanted to know a real value from noisy measurement, such as the position of a planet or the diameter of the moon. Using the mean of several measured values, scientists assumed that the errors add up to a relatively small number when compared to the total of all measured values. The method of taking the mean for reducing observation errors was indeed mainly developed in astronomy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amstatbakker"&gt;[http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v11n1/bakker.html Bakker, Arthur. "The early history of average values and implications for education." Journal of Statistics Education 11.1 (2003): 17-26.]&lt;/ref&gt; A possible precursor to the arithmetic mean is the [[mid-range]] (the mean of the two extreme values), used for example in Arabian astronomy of the ninth to eleventh centuries, but also in metallurgy and navigation.&lt;ref name="york.ac.uk"/&gt;

However, there are various older vague references to the use of the arithmetic mean (which are not as clear, but might reasonably have to do with our modern definition of the mean). In a text from the 4th century, it was written that (text in square brackets is a possible missing text that might clarify the meaning):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://arcaneknowledgeofthedeep.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/theologyarithmetic.pdf# |title=Waterfield, Robin. "The theology of arithmetic." On the Mystical, mathematical and Cosmological Symbolism of the First Ten Number (1988). page 70. |access-date=2018-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304212935/https://arcaneknowledgeofthedeep.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/theologyarithmetic.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: In the first place, we must set out in a row the sequence of numbers from the monad up to nine: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Then we must add up the amount of all of them together, and since the row contains nine terms, we must look for the ninth part of the total to see if it is already naturally present among the numbers in the row; and we will find that the property of being [one] ninth [of the sum] only belongs to the [arithmetic] mean itself...

Even older potential references exist. There are records that from about 700 BC, merchants and shippers agreed that damage to the cargo and ship (their "contribution" in case of damage by the sea) should be shared equally among themselves.&lt;ref name="amstatbakker"/&gt; This might have been calculated using the average, although there seem to be no direct record of the calculation.

===Etymology===
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "few words have received more etymological investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|average}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in ref|date=May 2015}} In the 16th century ''average'' meant a customs duty, or the like, and was used in the Mediterranean area. It came to mean the cost of damage sustained at sea. From that came an "average adjuster" who decided how to apportion a loss between the owners and insurers of a ship and cargo.

Marine damage is either ''particular average'', which is borne only by the owner of the damaged property, or [[general average]], where the owner can claim a proportional contribution from all the parties to the marine venture.  The type of calculations used in adjusting general average gave rise to the use of "average" to mean "arithmetic mean".

A second English usage, documented as early as 1674 and sometimes spelled "averish", is as the residue and second growth of field crops, which were considered suited to consumption by [[draught animal]]s ("avers").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ray |first=John |authorlink=John Ray |title=A Collection of English Words Not Generally Used |year=1674 |publisher=H. Bruges |location=London |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101037601729;view=1up;seq=19 |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The root is found in Arabic as ''awar'', in Italian as ''avaria'', in French as ''avarie'' and in Dutch as ''averij''. It is unclear in which language the word first appeared.

There is earlier (from at least the 11th century), unrelated use of the word. It appears to be an old legal term for a tenant's day labour obligation to a sheriff, probably anglicised from "avera" found in the English [[Domesday Book]] (1085).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3828">In mathematics, '''BCI and BCK algebras''' are [[algebraic structure]]s, introduced by Y. Imai,  K. Iséki and S. Tanaka in 1966, that describe fragments of the propositional calculus involving implication known as BCI and [[BCK logic]]s.

==Definition==

===BCI algebra===
An algebra &lt;math&gt;\left( X;\ast
,0\right)&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;\left( 2,0\right)&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''BCI-algebra'' if, for any &lt;math&gt;x,y,z\in X&lt;/math&gt;, it satisfies the following conditions. (Informally, we may read &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; as "truth" and &lt;math&gt;x\ast y&lt;/math&gt; as "&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;".)
; BCI-1: &lt;math&gt;\left( \left( x\ast y\right) \ast \left( x\ast z\right)
\right) \ast \left( z\ast y\right) =0&lt;/math&gt;
; BCI-2: &lt;math&gt;\left( x\ast \left( x\ast y\right) \right) \ast y=0&lt;/math&gt;
; BCI-3: &lt;math&gt;x\ast x=0&lt;/math&gt;
; BCI-4: &lt;math&gt;x\ast y=0 \land y\ast x=0\implies x=y&lt;/math&gt;
; BCI-5: &lt;math&gt;x\ast 0=0 \implies x=0&lt;/math&gt;

===BCK algebra===
A BCI-algebra &lt;math&gt;\left( X;\ast ,0\right)&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''BCK-algebra'' if it
satisfies the following condition:
; BCK-1: &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in X: 0\ast x=0. &lt;/math&gt;

A partial order can then be defined as ''x'' ≤ ''y'' iff x * y = 0.

A BCK-algebra is said to be ''commutative'' if it satisfies:
: &lt;math&gt;x\ast (x\ast y)= y\ast (y\ast x)&lt;/math&gt;
In a commutative BCK-algebra ''x'' * (''x'' * ''y'') = ''x'' ∧ ''y'' is the [[greatest lower bound]] of ''x'' and ''y'' under the partial order ≤.

A BCK-algebra is said to be bounded if it has a largest element, usually denoted by 1. In a bounded commutative BCK-algebra the least upper bound of two elements satisfies ''x'' ∨ ''y'' = 1 * ((1 * ''x'') ∧ (1 * ''y'')); that makes it a [[distributive lattice]].

==Examples==

Every [[abelian group]] is a BCI-algebra, with * defined as group subtraction and 0 defined as the group identity.

The subsets of a set form a BCK-algebra, where A*B is the [[Complement (set theory)|difference]] A\B (the elements in A but not in B), and 0 is the [[empty set]].

A [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is a BCK algebra if ''A''*''B'' is defined to be ''A''&amp;and;&amp;not;''B'' (''A'' does not imply ''B'').

The bounded commutative BCK-algebras are precisely the [[MV-algebra]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5227">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''circuit''' is a [[model of computation]] in which input values proceed through a sequence of gates, each of which computes a [[function (computer science)|function]]. Circuits of this kind provide a generalization of [[Boolean circuit]]s and a mathematical model for [[digital logic]] circuits. Circuits are defined by the gates they contain and the values the gates can produce.  For example, the values in a Boolean circuit are [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values, and the circuit includes [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[logical disjunction|disjunction]], and [[logical negation|negation]] gates.  The values in an [[integer circuit]] are [[set (mathematics)|set]]s of [[integer]]s and the gates compute [[set union]], [[set intersection]], and [[set complement]], as well as the [[arithmetic operation]]s [[addition]] and [[multiplication]].

== Formal definition ==
A circuit is a triple &lt;math&gt;(M, L, G)&lt;/math&gt;, where
* &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a set of values,
* &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a set of gate labels, each of which is a function from &lt;math&gt;M^{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; for some non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; represents the number of inputs to the gate), and
* &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[labelled graph|labelled]] [[directed acyclic graph]] with labels from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

The vertices of the graph are called ''gates''. For each gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of [[in-degree]] &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; can be labeled by an element &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is defined on &lt;math&gt;M^{i}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Terminology ===
The gates of in-degree 0 are called ''inputs'' or ''leaves''. The gates of out-degree 0 are called ''outputs''. If there is an edge from gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; to gate &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; in the graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''child'' of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. We suppose there is an order on the vertices of the graph, so we can speak of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;th child of a gate when &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is less than the out-degree of the gate.

The ''size'' of a circuit is the number of nodes of a circuit. The ''depth of a gate'' &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the [[longest path]] in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; beginning at &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; up to an output gate. In particular, the gates of out-degree 0 are the only gates of depth 1. The ''depth of a circuit'' is the maximum depth of any gate. 

''Level &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'' is the set of all gates of depth &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. A ''levelled circuit'' is a circuit in which the edges to gates of depth &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; comes only from gates of depth &lt;math&gt;i + 1&lt;/math&gt; or from the inputs. In other words, edges only exist between adjacent levels of the circuit. The ''width'' of a levelled circuit is the maximum size of any level.

=== Evaluation ===
The exact value &lt;math&gt;V(g)&lt;/math&gt; of a gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with in-degree &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and label &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is defined recursively for all gates &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;
V(g) = 
\begin{cases}
  l &amp; \text{if } g \text{ is an input} \\
  l(V(g_1), \dotsc, V(g_i)) &amp; \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where each &lt;math&gt;g_j&lt;/math&gt; is a parent of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

The value of the circuit is the value of each of the output gates.

== Circuits as functions ==
The labels of the leaves can also be variables which take values in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. If there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; leaves, then the circuit can be seen as a function from  &lt;math&gt;M^{n}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. It is then usual to consider a family of circuits &lt;math&gt;(C_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;, a sequence of circuits indexed by the integers where the circuit &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables. Families of circuits can thus be seen as functions from &lt;math&gt;M^{*}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

The notions of size, depth and width can be naturally extended to families of functions, becoming functions from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;; for example, &lt;math&gt;size(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th circuit of the family. 

== Complexity and algorithmic problems ==

Computing the output of a given [[Boolean circuit]] on a specific input is [[P-complete]] problem. If the input is an [[integer circuit]], however, it is unknown whether this problem is [[decidable language|decidable]].

[[Circuit complexity]] attempts to classify [[Boolean function]]s with respect to the size or depth of circuits that can compute them.

In [[computer science]], a computation is said to '''diverge''' if it does not terminate or terminates in an (unobservable) [[exceptional state]]. Otherwise it is said to '''converge'''. In domains where computations are expected to be infinite, such as [[process calculi]], a computation is said to diverge if it fails to be [[productivity (computer science)|productive]] (always produces an action within a finite amount of time.)

== Definitions ==
Various subfields of computer science use varying, but mathematically precise, definitions of what it means for a computation to converge or diverge.

=== Rewriting ===
In [[abstract rewriting]], an [[abstract rewriting system]] is called convergent if it is both [[confluent (abstract rewriting)|confluent]] and [[Abstract rewriting system#Termination and convergence|terminating]].{{sfn|Baader|Nipkow|1998|p=9}}

The notation ''t'' &amp;darr; ''n'' means that ''t'' reduces to normal form ''n'' in zero or more [[reduction (abstract rewriting)|reduction]]s, ''t''&amp;darr; means ''t'' reduces to some normal form in zero or more reductions, and ''t''&amp;uarr; means ''t'' does not reduce to a normal form; the latter is impossible in a terminating rewriting system.

In the [[lambda calculus]] an expression is divergent if it has no [[normal form (abstract rewriting)|normal form]].{{sfn|Pierce|2002|p=65}}

=== Denotational semantics ===
In [[denotational semantics]] an [[function (computer science)|object function]] ''f'' : ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' can be modelled as a [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] ''f'' : ''A'' &amp;cup; {&amp;perp;} &amp;rarr; ''B'' &amp;cup; {&amp;perp;} where &amp;perp; ([[bottom element|bottom]]) indicates that the object function or its [[argument (computer science)|argument]] diverges.

=== Concurrency theory ===
In the calculus of [[communicating sequential processes]], divergence is a drastic situation where a process performs an endless series of hidden actions. For example, consider the following process, defined by [[Communicating sequential processes|CSP]] notation:
:&lt;math&gt;Clock = tick \rightarrow Clock&lt;/math&gt;
The traces of this process are defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{traces}(Clock) = \{\langle\rangle, \langle tick \rangle, \langle tick,tick \rangle, \cdots \} = \{ tick \}^*&lt;/math&gt;
Now, consider the following process, which conceals the ''tick'' event of the ''Clock'' process:
:&lt;math&gt;P= Clock \backslash tick&lt;/math&gt;
By definition, ''P'' is called a divergent process.

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], the '''Errera graph''' is a graph with 17 [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] and 45 [[edge (graph theory)|edge]]s. [[Alfred Errera]] published it in 1921 as a counterexample to [[Alfred Kempe|Kempe]]'s erroneous proof of the [[four color theorem]];{{r|hw|errera}} it was named after Errera by {{harvtxt|Hutchinson|Wagon|1998}}.{{r|hw}}

==Properties==

The Errera graph is [[Planar graph|planar]] and has [[chromatic number]] 4, [[chromatic index]] 6, [[radius (graph theory)|radius]] 3, [[diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] 4 and [[girth (graph theory)|girth]] 3. All its vertices are of degree 5 or 6 and it is a 5-[[k-vertex-connected graph|vertex-connected graph]] and a 5-[[k-edge-connected graph|edge-connected graph]].

The Errera graph is not a [[vertex-transitive graph]] and its full automorphism group is isomorphic to the [[dihedral group]] of order 20, the group of symmetries of a [[decagon]], including both rotations and reflections.

The [[characteristic polynomial]] of the Errera graph is &lt;math&gt;-(x^2-2 x-5) (x^2+x-1)^2 (x^3-4 x^2-9 x+10) (x^4+2 x^3-7 x^2-18 x-9)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Application to the four color theorem==
[[File:Errera Kempe chains.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Tangled [[:en:Kempe chain|Kempe chains]] in the Errera graph.]]
The [[four color theorem]] states that the vertices of every planar graph can be colored with four colors, so that no two adjacent vertices have equal colors. An erroneous proof was published in 1879 by [[Alfred Kempe]], but it was discovered to be erroneous by 1890. The four color theorem was not given a valid proof until 1976.
Kempe's proof can be translated into an [[algorithm]] to color planar graphs, which is also erroneous. Counterexamples to his proof were found in 1890 and 1896 (the [[Poussin graph]]), and later, the Fritsch graph and Soifer graph provided two smaller counterexamples.{{r|gs}}
However, until the work of Kempe, these counterexamples did not show that the whole coloring algorithm fails. Rather, they assumed that all but one vertex of the graph had already been colored,
and showed that Kempe's method (which purportedly would modify the coloring to extend it to the whole graphs) failed in those precolored instances. The Errera graph, on the other hand, provides a counterexample to Kempe's entire method. When this method is run on the Errera graph, starting with no vertices colored, it can fail to find a valid coloring for the whole graph.{{r|hw}}
Additionally, unlike the Poussin graph, all vertices in the Errera graph have degree five or more. Therefore, on this graph, it is impossible to avoid the problematic cases of Kempe's method by choosing lower-degree vertices.

The figure shows an example of how Kempe's proof can fail for this graph. In the figure, the adjacencies between regions of this map form the Errera graph, partially four-colored with the outer region uncolored. Kempe's erroneous proof follows the idea of extending partial colorings such as this one by recoloring [[Kempe chain]]s,
connected subgraphs that have only two colors. Any such chain can be recolored, preserving the validity of the coloring, by swapping its two colors on all vertices of the chain.
Kempe's proof has different cases depending on whether the next vertex to be colored has three, four, or five neighbors and on how those neighbors are colored. In the case shown, the vertex to be colored next is the one corresponding to the outer region of the map.
This region cannot be colored directly, because it already has neighbors of all four different colors. The blue and yellow neighbors are connected by a single Kempe chain (shown by the dashed yellow lines in the image), preventing a swap from making them both blue or both yellow and freeing a color.
Similarly, the blue and green neighbors are connected by another Kempe chain (the dashed green lines). In such a case, Kempe's proof would try to simultaneously swap the colors on two Kempe chains, the left red-yellow chain and the right red-green chain (dashed red lines).
The blue-green chain blocks the left red-yellow chain from reaching the right side of the graph, and the blue-yellow chain blocks the right red-green chain from reaching the left, so it would seem that simultaneously swapping the colors on these two chains is a safe operation.
But because the blue-yellow and blue-green chains cross each other rather than staying separated, there is a region in the middle of the figure where the red-yellow and red-green chains can meet.
When these two chains meet in the middle, the simultaneous swap causes adjacent yellow and green vertices in this middle area (such as the vertices represented by the upper yellow and green regions in the figure) to both become red, producing an invalid coloring.

==Applications in chemistry==
[[Chemical graph theory]] concerns the graph-theoretic structure of [[molecule]]s and other clusters of atoms. Both the Errera graph itself and its [[dual graph]] are relevant in this context.

Atoms of [[metal]]s such as [[gold]] can form [[Cluster (physics)|cluster]]s in which a central atom is surrounded by twelve more atoms, in the pattern of an [[icosahedron]]. Another, larger, type of cluster can be formed by coalescing two of these icosahedral clusters, so that the central atom of each cluster becomes one of the boundary atoms for the other cluster.
The resulting cluster of 19 atoms has two interior atoms (the centers of the two icosahedra) with 17 atoms in the outer shell in the pattern of the Errera graph.{{r|mm}}

The [[dual graph]] of the Errera graph is a [[fullerene]]{{r|hw}} with 30 vertices, designated in the chemistry literature as C&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;(D&lt;sub&gt;5''h''&lt;/sub&gt;){{r|msp}} or F&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;(D&lt;sub&gt;5''h''&lt;/sub&gt;){{r|ds}} to indicate its symmetry and distinguish it from other 30-vertex fullerenes.
This shape also plays a central role in the construction of higher-dimensional fullerenes.{{r|ds}}

"The individual partials are not heard separately but are blended together by the ear into a single tone."&lt;ref&gt;Benward, Bruce and Saker, Marilyn (1997/2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.xiii. Seventh edition. McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, if &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the fundamental frequency, then a harmonic spectrum has the form 
:&lt;math&gt;\{\dots, -2\omega, -\omega, 0, \omega, 2\omega, \dots\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A standard result of [[Fourier analysis]] is that a function has a harmonic spectrum if and only if it is [[periodic function|periodic]].

where ''q'' is a power of ''p'' and ''m''&lt;sup&gt;[''q'']&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by the ''q''-th powers of elements of the [[maximal ideal]] ''m''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dima.unige.it/~conca/Articoli%20Conca%20PDF/PDF%20da%20rivista/%281996%20%29%20Conca%20-%20Hilbert-Kunz%20function%20of%20monomial%20ideals%20and%20binomial%20hypersurfaces.pdf|title=Hilbert-Kunz function of monomial ideals and binomial hypersurfaces  |last=Conca|first=Aldo |publisher= Springer Verlag 90, 287 - 300 |date=1996 |website=http://www.dima.unige.it |format=PDF |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion was introduced by [[Ernst Kunz (mathematician)|Ernst Kunz]], who used it to characterize a [[regular ring]] as a [[Noetherian ring]] in which the [[Frobenius morphism]] is [[flat module|flat]]. If d is the dimension of the local ring, Monsky showed that f(q)/(q^d) is c+O(1/q) for some real constant c. This constant, the "Hilbert-Kunz" multiplicity", is greater than or equal to 1. Watanabe and Yoshida strengthened some of Kunz's results, showing that in the unmixed case, the ring is regular precisely when c=1.

Hilbert–Kunz functions and multiplicities have been studied for their own sake. Brenner and Trivedi have treated local rings coming from the homogeneous co-ordinate rings of smooth projective curves, using techniques from algebraic geometry. Han, [[Paul Monsky|Monsky]] and Teixeira have treated diagonal hypersurfaces and various related hypersurfaces. But there is no known technique for determining the Hilbert–Kunz function or c in general. In particular the question of whether c is always rational wasn't settled until recently (by Brenner—it needn't be, and indeed can be transcendental). Hochster and Huneke related Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities to "tight closure" and Brenner and Monsky used Hilbert–Kunz functions to show that localization need not preserve tight closure. The question of how c behaves as the characteristic goes to infinity (say for a hypersurface defined by a polynomial with integer coefficients) has also received attention; once again open questions abound.

A comprehensive overview is to be found in Craig Huneke's article "Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities and the F-signature" arXiv:1409.0467. This article is also found on pages 485-525 of the Springer volume "Commutative Algebra: Expository Papers Dedicated to David Eisenbud on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday", edited by Irena Peeva.

In the [[mathematics]] of [[graph theory]], two graphs, ''G'' and ''H'', are called '''homomorphically equivalent''' if there exists a graph homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f\colon G\to H&lt;/math&gt; and a graph homomorphism &lt;math&gt;g\colon H\to G&lt;/math&gt;. An example usage of this notion is that any two [[Core (graph theory)#Properties|cores]] of a graph are homomorphically equivalent.

Homomorphic equivalence also comes up in the theory of [[databases]]. Given a [[database schema]], two [[instance (database)|instances]] I and J on it are called homomorphically equivalent if there exists an instance homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f\colon I\to J&lt;/math&gt; and an instance homomorphism &lt;math&gt;g\colon J\to I&lt;/math&gt;.

In fact for any [[Category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'', one can define homomorphic equivalence. It is used in the theory of [[accessible categories]], where "weak universality" is the best one can hope for in terms of injectivity classes; see &lt;ref&gt;Adamek and Rosicky, "Locally Presentable and Accessible Categories".&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cryptography]], '''homomorphic secret sharing''' is a type of [[secret sharing]] [[algorithm]] in which the secret is encrypted via [[homomorphic encryption]]. A [[homomorphism]] is a transformation from one [[algebraic structure]] into another of the same type so that the structure is preserved. Importantly, this means that for every kind of manipulation of the original data, there is a corresponding manipulation of the transformed data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoenmakers|first=Berry|title=A simple publicly verifiable secret sharing scheme and its application to electronic voting|journal=Advances in Cryptology|year=1999|volume=1666|pages=148–164|citeseerx = 10.1.1.102.9375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

Homomorphic secret sharing is used to transmit a secret to several recipients as follows:

# Transform the "secret" using a homomorphism. This often puts the secret into a form which is easy to manipulate or store. In particular, there may be a natural way to 'split' the new form as required by step (2).
# Split the transformed secret into several parts, one for each recipient. The secret must be split in such a way that it can only be recovered when all or most of the parts are combined. (See [[secret sharing]])
# Distribute the parts of the secret to each of the recipients.
# Combine each of the recipients' parts to recover the transformed secret, perhaps at a specified time.
# Reverse the homomorphism to recover the original secret.

== Example: decentralized voting protocol ==

Suppose a community wants to perform an election, but they want to ensure that the vote-counters won't lie about the results. Using a kind of homomorphic secret sharing known as [[Shamir's secret sharing]], each member of the community can put his vote into a form that can be split into pieces, then submit each piece to a different vote-counter. The pieces are designed so that the vote-counters can't predict how altering a piece of a vote will affect the whole vote; thus, vote-counters are discouraged from tampering with their pieces. When all votes have been received, the vote-counters combine all the pieces together, which allows them to reverse the alteration process and to recover the aggregate election results.

In detail, suppose we have an election with:
* Two possible outcomes, either ''yes'' or ''no''. We'll represent those outcomes numerically by +1 and -1, respectively.
* A number of authorities, ''k'', who will count the votes.
* A number of voters, ''n'', who will submit votes.

Assume the election has two outcomes, so each member of the community can vote either ''yes'' or ''no''. We'll represent those votes numerically by +1 and -1, respectively.

# In advance, each authority generates a publicly available numerical key, ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''.
# Each voter encodes his vote in a polynomial ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' according to the following rules: The polynomial should have degree ''k-1'', its constant term should be either ''+1'' or ''-1'' (corresponding to voting "yes" or voting "no"), and its other coefficients should be randomly generated.
#  Each voter computes the value of his polynomial ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' at each authority's public key ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''.
#*  This produces ''k'' points, one for each authority.
#* These ''k'' points are the "pieces" of the vote: If you know all of the points, you can figure out the polynomial ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (and hence you can figure out how the voter voted). However, if you know only some of the points, you can't figure out the polynomial. (This is because you need ''k'' points to determine a degree-''k-1'' polynomial. Two points determine a line, three points determine a parabola, etc.)
# The voter sends each authority the value that was produced using the authority's key.
# Each authority collects the values that he receives. Since each authority only gets one value from each voter, he can't discover any given voter's polynomial. Moreover, he can't predict how altering the submissions will affect the vote.
# Once the voters have submitted their votes, each authority ''k'' computes and announces the sum ''A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' of all the values he's received.
# There are ''k'' sums, ''A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''; when they are combined together, they determine a unique polynomial ''P(x)''---specifically, the sum of all the voter polynomials: P(x) = p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(x) + p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(x) + … + p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(x).
#* The constant term of ''P(x)'' is in fact the sum of all the votes, because the constant term of P(x) is the sum of the constant terms of the individual ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.
#* Thus the constant term of ''P(x)'' provides the aggregate election result: if it's positive, more people voted for +1 than for -1; if it's negative, more people voted for -1 than for +1.

[[File:Homomorphic secret sharing, voting example.svg|frame|center|alt=A table illustrating the voting protocol| An illustration of the voting protocol. Each column represents the pieces of a particular voter's vote. Each row represents the pieces received by a particular authority.]]

=== Features ===

This protocol works as long as not all of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; authorities are corrupt — if they were, then they could collaborate to reconstruct &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; for each voter and also subsequently alter the votes.

The [[Cryptographic protocol|protocol]] requires t+1 authorities to be completed, therefore in case there are N&gt;t+1 authorities, N-t-1 authorities can be corrupted, which gives the protocol a certain degree of robustness.

The protocol manages the IDs of the voters (the IDs were submitted with the ballots) and therefore can verify that only legitimate voters have voted.

Under the assumptions on t:
#A ballot cannot be backtracked to the ID so the privacy of the voters is preserved.
#A voter cannot prove how they voted.
#It is impossible to verify a vote.

The [[Cryptographic protocol|protocol]] implicitly prevents corruption of ballots.
This is because the authorities have no incentive to change the ballot since each authority has only a share of the ballot and has no knowledge how changing this share will affect the outcome.

=== Vulnerabilities ===

*The voter cannot be certain that their vote has been recorded correctly.
*The authorities cannot be sure the votes were legal and equal, for example the voter can choose a value which is not a valid option (i.e. not in {-1, 1}) such as -20, 50 which will tilt the results in their favor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3757">In [[cryptography]], a '''hybrid cryptosystem''' is one which combines the convenience of a public-key cryptosystem with the efficiency of a symmetric-key cryptosystem. [[public-key cryptography|Public-key cryptosystems]] are convenient in that they do not require the sender and receiver to share a common secret in order to communicate securely (among other useful properties). However, they often rely on complicated mathematical computations and are thus generally much more inefficient than comparable [[symmetric-key cipher|symmetric-key cryptosystems]]. In many applications, the high cost of encrypting long messages in a public-key cryptosystem can be prohibitive. This is addressed by hybrid systems by using a combination of both.

A hybrid cryptosystem can be constructed using any two separate cryptosystems:
* a '''key encapsulation''' scheme, which is a public-key cryptosystem, and
* a '''data encapsulation''' scheme, which is a symmetric-key cryptosystem.

The hybrid cryptosystem is itself a public-key system, whose public and private keys are the same as in the key encapsulation scheme.

Note that for very long messages the bulk of the work in encryption/decryption is done by the more efficient symmetric-key scheme, while the inefficient public-key scheme is used only to encrypt/decrypt a short key value.

All practical implementations of public key cryptography today employ the use of a hybrid system. Examples include the [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] protocol which uses a public-key mechanism for key exchange (such as [[Diffie-Hellman]]) and a symmetric-key mechanism for data encapsulation (such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]). The [[OpenPGP]] (RFC 4880) file format and the [[PKCS #7]] (RFC 2315) file format are other examples.

== Example ==
To encrypt a message addressed to Alice in a hybrid cryptosystem, Bob does the following:
# Obtains Alice's public key.
# Generates a fresh symmetric key for the data encapsulation scheme.
# Encrypts the message under the data encapsulation scheme, using the symmetric key just generated.
# Encrypts the symmetric key under the key encapsulation scheme, using Alice's public key.
# Sends both of these encryptions to Alice.

To decrypt this hybrid ciphertext, Alice does the following:
# Uses her private key to decrypt the symmetric key contained in the key encapsulation segment.
# Uses this symmetric key to decrypt the message contained in the data encapsulation segment.

==Security==

If both the key encapsulation and data encapsulation schemes are secure against [[adaptive chosen ciphertext attack]]s, then the hybrid scheme inherits that property as well.&lt;ref name=cramer-shoup&gt;{{cite journal

In [[mathematics]], the '''hyperoperation sequence'''{{refn
  | Sequences similar to the ''hyperoperation sequence'' have historically been referred to by many names, including: the ''[[Ackermann function]]''&lt;ref name=geisler/&gt; (3-argument), the ''Ackermann hierarchy'',&lt;ref name=friedman/&gt; the ''[[Grzegorczyk hierarchy]]''&lt;ref name=campagnola/&gt;&lt;ref name=wirz/&gt; (which is more general), ''Goodstein's version of the Ackermann function'',&lt;ref name=goodstein/&gt; ''operation of the nth grade'',&lt;ref name=bennett/&gt; ''z-fold iterated exponentiation of x with y'',&lt;ref name=black/&gt; ''[[Knuth's up-arrow notation|arrow]] operations'',&lt;ref name=littlewood/&gt; ''reihenalgebra''&lt;ref name=mueller/&gt; and ''hyper-n''.&lt;ref name=geisler /&gt;&lt;ref name=mueller /&gt;&lt;ref name=munafo/&gt;&lt;ref name=robbins/&gt;&lt;ref name=galidakis/&gt;
  | group="nb"
}} is an infinite [[sequence]] of arithmetic operations (called ''hyperoperations'' in this context)&lt;ref name=geisler/&gt;&lt;ref name=robbins /&gt;&lt;ref name=romerioAck/&gt; that starts with a [[unary operation]] (the [[successor function]] with ''n'' = 0).  The sequence continues with the [[binary operation]]s of [[addition]] (''n'' = 1), [[multiplication]] (''n'' = 2), and [[exponentiation]] (''n'' = 3).

After that, the sequence proceeds with further binary operations extending beyond exponentiation, using [[Operator associativity|right-associativity]].  For the operations beyond exponentiation, the ''n''th member of this sequence is named by [[Reuben Goodstein]] after the [[Numerical prefix|Greek prefix]] of ''n'' suffixed with ''-ation'' (such as [[tetration]] (''n'' = 4), [[pentation]] (''n'' = 5), hexation (''n'' = 6), etc.)&lt;ref name=goodstein /&gt; and can be written as using ''n'' − 2 arrows in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]].
Each hyperoperation may be understood [[Recursion (computer science)|recursively]] in terms of the previous one by:

:&lt;math&gt;a[n]b = \underbrace{a[n-1](a[n-1](a[n-1](\cdots[n-1](a[n-1](a[n-1]a))\cdots)))}_{\displaystyle b \mbox{ copies of } a},\quad n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;

It may also be defined according to the recursion rule part of the definition, as in Knuth's up-arrow version of the [[Ackermann function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;a[n]b = a[n-1]\left(a[n]\left(b - 1\right)\right),\quad n \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;

This can be used to easily show numbers much larger than those which [[scientific notation]] can, such as [[Skewes' number]] and [[googolplexplex]] (e.g. &lt;math&gt;50[50]50&lt;/math&gt; is much larger than Skewes’ number and googolplexplex), but there are some numbers which even they cannot easily show, such as [[Graham's number]] and [[TREE(3)]].

This recursion rule is common to many variants of hyperoperations (see [[#Generalization|below]] in definition).

== Definition ==
The ''hyperoperation sequence'' &lt;math&gt;H_n(a,b) \,:\, (\mathbb{N}_0)^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[sequence]] of [[binary operation]]s &lt;math&gt;H_n \,:\, (\mathbb{N}_0)^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt;, defined [[recursion|recursively]] as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
  H_n(a,b) = a[n]b = 
    \begin{cases}
                          b + 1 &amp; \text{if } n = 0 \\
                              a &amp; \text{if } n = 1 \text{ and } b = 0 \\
                              0 &amp; \text{if } n = 2 \text{ and } b = 0 \\
                              1 &amp; \text{if } n \ge 3 \text{ and } b = 0 \\
      H_{n-1}(a, H_n(a, b - 1)) &amp; \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that for ''n'' = 0, the [[binary operation]] essentially reduces to a [[unary operation]] ([[successor function]]) by ignoring the first argument.)

For ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, this definition reproduces the basic arithmetic operations of [[successor function|successor]] (which is a unary operation), [[addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]], respectively, as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  H_0(a, b) &amp;= b + 1\,\!, \\
  H_1(a, b) &amp;= a + b\,\!, \\
  H_2(a, b) &amp;= a \cdot b\,\!, \\
  H_3(a, b) &amp;= a^{b}\,\!,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So what will be the next operation after exponentiation? We defined multiplication so that &lt;math&gt; H_2(a, 3) = a[2]3 = a \times 3 = a + a + a,&lt;/math&gt;, and defined exponentiation so that &lt;math&gt; H_3(a, 3) = a[3]3 = a^3 = a \cdot a \cdot a,&lt;/math&gt; so it seems logical to define the next operation, tetration, so that &lt;math&gt; H_4(a, 3) = a[4]3 = \operatorname{tetration}(a, 3) = a^{a^a}, &lt;/math&gt; with a tower of three 'a'. Analogously, the pentation of (a, 3) will be tetration(a, tetration(a, a)), with three "a" in it.

The H operations for ''n'' ≥ 3 can be written in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  H_4(a,b) &amp;= a\uparrow\uparrow{b}\,\!, \\
  H_5(a,b) &amp;= a\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow{b}\,\!, \\
    \ldots &amp; \\
  H_n(a,b) &amp;= a\uparrow^{n-2}b \text{ for } n \ge 3\,\!, \\
    \ldots &amp; \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Knuth's notation could be extended to negative indices ≥ −2 in such a way as to agree with the entire hyperoperation sequence, except for the lag in the indexing:
:&lt;math&gt;H_n(a, b) = a \uparrow^{n-2}b\text{ for } n \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The hyperoperations can thus be seen as an answer to the question "what's next" in the [[sequence]]: [[Peano postulates#The axioms|successor]], [[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[exponentiation]], and so on. Noting that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                 a + b &amp;= (a + (b - 1)) + 1 \\
             a \cdot b &amp;= a + (a \cdot (b - 1)) \\
                   a^b &amp;= a \cdot \left(a^{(b - 1)}\right) \\
               a [4] b &amp;= a^{a [4] (b - 1)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

the relationship between basic arithmetic operations is illustrated, allowing the higher operations to be defined naturally as above.  The parameters of the hyperoperation hierarchy are sometimes referred to by their analogous exponentiation term;&lt;ref name=romerioTerms&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; so ''a'' is the '''''base''''', ''b'' is the '''''exponent''''' (or ''hyperexponent''),&lt;ref name=galidakis /&gt; and ''n'' is the '''''rank''''' (or ''grade'').&lt;ref name=bennett /&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;H_n(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; is read as "the ''b''th ''n''-ation of ''a''", e.g. &lt;math&gt;H_4(7,9)&lt;/math&gt; is read as "the 9th tetration of 7", and &lt;math&gt;H_{123}(456,789)&lt;/math&gt; is read as "the 789th 123-ation of 456".

In common terms, the hyperoperations are ways of compounding numbers that increase in growth based on the iteration of the previous hyperoperation. The concepts of successor, addition, multiplication and exponentiation are all hyperoperations; the successor operation (producing ''x'' + 1 from ''x'') is the most primitive, the addition operator specifies the number of times 1 is to be added to itself to produce a final value, multiplication specifies the number of times a number is to be added to itself, and exponentiation refers to the number of times a number is to be multiplied by itself.

== History ==

One of the earliest discussions of hyperoperations was that of Albert Bennett&lt;ref name=bennett /&gt; in 1914, who developed some of the theory of ''commutative hyperoperations'' (see [[#Commutative hyperoperations|below]]). About 12 years later, [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] defined the function &lt;math&gt;\phi(a, b, n)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=ackOrig&gt;
{{cite journal
 | author=Wilhelm Ackermann
 | journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]]
 | title=Zum Hilbertschen Aufbau der reellen Zahlen
 | year=1928 | volume=99 | pages=118–133
 | doi=10.1007/BF01459088
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which somewhat resembles the hyperoperation sequence.

In his 1947 paper,&lt;ref name=goodstein/&gt; [[R. L. Goodstein]] introduced the specific sequence of operations that are now called ''hyperoperations'', and also suggested the Greek names [[tetration]], pentation, etc., for the extended operations beyond exponentiation (because they correspond to the indices 4, 5, etc.).   As a three-argument function, e.g., &lt;math&gt;G(n, a, b) = H_n(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;, the hyperoperation sequence as a whole is seen to be a version of the original [[Ackermann function]] &lt;math&gt;\phi(a, b, n)&lt;/math&gt; — [[computable function|recursive]] but not [[primitive recursive]] — as modified by Goodstein to incorporate the primitive [[successor function]] together with the other three basic operations of arithmetic ([[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[exponentiation]]), and to make a more seamless extension of these beyond exponentiation.

The original three-argument [[Ackermann function]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; uses the same recursion rule as does Goodstein's version of it (i.e., the hyperoperation sequence), but differs from it in two ways. First, &lt;math&gt;\phi(a, b, n)&lt;/math&gt; defines a sequence of operations starting from addition (''n'' = 0) rather than the [[successor function]], then multiplication (''n'' = 1), exponentiation (''n'' = 2), etc.  Secondly, the initial conditions for &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; result in &lt;math&gt;\phi(a, b, 3) = G(4,a,b+1) =
a [4] (b + 1)&lt;/math&gt;, thus differing from the hyperoperations beyond exponentiation.&lt;ref name=black/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of the ''b'' + 1 in the previous expression is that &lt;math&gt;\phi(a, b, 3)&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;a^{a^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^a}}}}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''b'' counts the number of ''operators'' (exponentiations), rather than counting the number of ''operands'' ("a"s) as does the ''b'' in &lt;math&gt;a [4] b&lt;/math&gt;, and so on for the higher-level operations. (See the [[Ackermann function]] article for details.)

=== Variant starting from ''a'' ===
{{Main|Ackermann function}}

In 1928, [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] defined a 3-argument function &lt;math&gt;\phi(a, b, n)&lt;/math&gt; which gradually evolved into a 2-argument function known as the [[Ackermann function]]. The ''original'' Ackermann function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; was less similar to modern hyperoperations, because his initial conditions start with &lt;math&gt;\phi(a, 0, n) = a&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n'' &gt; 2. Also he assigned addition to ''n'' = 0, multiplication to ''n'' = 1 and exponentiation to ''n'' = 2, so the initial conditions produce very different operations for tetration and beyond.

Another initial condition that has been used is &lt;math&gt;A(0, b) = 2b + 1&lt;/math&gt; (where the base is constant &lt;math&gt;a = 2&lt;/math&gt;), due to Rózsa Péter, which does not form a hyperoperation hierarchy.

=== Variant starting from 0 ===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; have renewed interest in the application of hyperoperations to [[Floating point|floating-point]] representation. (Since ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''a'', ''b'') are all defined for ''b'' = -1.) While discussing [[tetration]], Clenshaw ''et al.'' assumed the initial condition &lt;math&gt;F_n(a, 0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which makes yet another hyperoperation hierarchy. Just like in the previous variant, the fourth operation is very similar to [[tetration]], but offset by one.

=== Lower hyperoperations ===
An alternative for these hyperoperations is obtained by evaluation from left to right. Since
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      a + b &amp;= (a + (b - 1)) + 1 \\
  a \cdot b &amp;= (a \cdot (b - 1)) + a \\
        a^b &amp;= \left(a^{(b-1)}\right) \cdot a
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
define (with ° or subscript)
:&lt;math&gt;a_{(n+1)}b = \left(a_{(n + 1)}(b - 1)\right)_{(n)} a&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  a_{(1)} b &amp;= a + b \\
  a_{(2)} 0 &amp;= 0 \\
  a_{(n)} 1 &amp;= a &amp; \text{for } n&gt;2 \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This was extended to ordinal numbers by Donner and Tarski,&lt;ref name="Donner-Tarski"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=John Donner| author2=Alfred Tarski| author2link=Alfred Tarski| title=An extended arithmetic of ordinal numbers| journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae| volume=65| year=1969| pages=95–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Definition 1]&lt;/sup&gt; by :

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       \alpha O_0 \beta &amp;= \alpha + \beta \\
  \alpha O_\gamma \beta &amp;= \sup\limits_{\eta&lt;\beta, \xi&lt;\gamma}(\alpha O_\gamma \eta) O_\xi \alpha
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from Definition 1(i), Corollary 2(ii), and Theorem 9, that, for ''a'' &amp;ge; 2 and ''b'' &amp;ge; 1, that {{original research inline|date=January 2015}}
:&lt;math&gt; a O_n b = a_{(n + 1)} b&lt;/math&gt;

But this suffers a kind of collapse, failing to form the "power tower" traditionally expected of hyperoperators:&lt;ref name="Donner-Tarski"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Theorem 3(iii)]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref group=nb name=commutative&gt;Ordinal addition is not commutative; see [[ordinal arithmetic]] for more information&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{(4)}(1 + \beta) = \alpha^{\left(\alpha^\beta\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

If &amp;alpha; &amp;ge; 2 and &amp;gamma; &amp;ge; 2,&lt;ref name="Donner-Tarski"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[Corollary 33(i)]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref group=nb name=commutative/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{(1 + 2\gamma + 1)}\beta \leq \alpha_{(1 + 2\gamma)}(1 + 3\alpha\beta).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Commutative hyperoperations ===

Commutative hyperoperations were considered by Albert Bennett as early as 1914,&lt;ref name=bennett /&gt; which is possibly the earliest remark about any hyperoperation sequence. Commutative hyperoperations are defined by the recursion rule
:&lt;math&gt;F_{n+1}(a, b) = \exp(F_n(\ln(a), \ln(b)))&lt;/math&gt;
which is symmetric in ''a'' and ''b'', meaning all hyperoperations are commutative. This sequence does not contain [[exponentiation]], and so does not form a hyperoperation hierarchy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2890">In [[abstract algebra]], a '''Koszul algebra''' &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[graded algebra|graded]]  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-[[algebra over a field|algebra]] over which the [[ground field]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; has a linear minimal graded free resolution, ''i.e.'', there exists an [[exact sequence]]:
 
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots \rightarrow R(-i)^{b_i} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow R(-2)^{b_2} \rightarrow R(-1)^{b_1} \rightarrow R \rightarrow k \rightarrow 0.&lt;/math&gt;
It is named after the French mathematician [[Jean-Louis Koszul]].

Here, &lt;math&gt;R(-j)&lt;/math&gt; is the graded algebra &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; with grading shifted up by &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;R(-j)_i = R_{i-j}&lt;/math&gt;. The exponents &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; refer to the &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;-fold direct sum.

We can choose bases for the free modules in the resolution; then the maps can be written as matrices. For a Koszul algebra, the entries in the matrices are zero or linear forms.

An example of a Koszul algebra is a [[polynomial ring]] over a field, for which the [[Koszul complex]] is the minimal graded free resolution of the ground field. There are Koszul algebras whose ground fields have infinite minimal graded free resolutions, ''e.g'', &lt;math&gt;R = k[x,y]/(xy) &lt;/math&gt;

The polynomial's linearity means that each of its terms has [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] 0 or 1. Usually the context is the evolution of some variable over time, with the current [[discrete time|time period]] or discrete moment in time denoted as {{math|''t''}}, one period earlier denoted as {{math|''t''–1}}, one period later as {{math|''t''+1}}, etc.

An ''n''-th order linear difference equation is one that can be written in terms of [[parameter#Mathematical functions|parameters]] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b'' as

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = a_1y_{t-1} + \cdots + a_ny_{t-n} + b&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently as

:&lt;math&gt;y_{t+n}= a_1y_{t+n-1} + \cdots + a_ny_t + b.&lt;/math&gt;

The equation is called ''homogeneous'' if &lt;math&gt;b=0&lt;/math&gt; and ''inhomogeneous'' if &lt;math&gt;b \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since the longest time lag between iterates appearing in the equation is ''n'', this is an ''n''-th order equation, where ''n'' could be any positive integer. When the longest lag is specified numerically so ''n'' does not appear notationally as the longest time lag, ''n'' is occasionally used instead of ''t'' to index iterates.

In the most general case the coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b'' could themselves be functions of time; however, this article treats the most common case, that of constant coefficients. If the coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[Polynomial|polynomials]] in {{math|''t''}} the equation is called a [[P-recursive equation|linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients]]. 

The ''[[equation solving|solution]]'' of such an equation is a function of time, and not of any iterate values, giving the value of the iterate at any time. To find the solution it is necessary to know the specific values (known as ''[[initial condition]]s'') of ''n'' of the iterates, and normally these are the ''n'' iterates that are oldest. The equation or its variable is said to be ''[[Lyapunov stability#Definition for discrete-time systems|stable]]'' if from any set of initial conditions the variable's limit as time goes to infinity exists; this limit is called the ''[[steady state]]''.

Difference equations are used in a variety of contexts, such as in [[economics]] to model the evolution through time of variables such as [[gross domestic product]], the [[inflation rate]], the [[exchange rate]], etc. They are used in modeling such [[time series]] because values of these variables are only measured at discrete intervals. In [[econometrics|econometric]] applications, linear difference equations are modeled with [[stochastic process|stochastic terms]] in the form of [[autoregressive model|autoregressive (AR) model]]s and in models such as [[vector autoregression]] (VAR) and [[autoregressive moving average]] (ARMA) models that combine AR with other features.

==Solution of homogeneous case==
{{See also|Recurrence equation#Solving homogeneous linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients}}

===Characteristic equation and roots===

Solving the homogeneous equation &lt;math&gt;x_t= a_1x_{t-1} + \cdots + a_nx_{t-n} &lt;/math&gt; involves first solving its [[characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^n = a_1\lambda^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-2}\lambda^2+a_{n-1} \lambda + a_n&lt;/math&gt;

for its characteristic roots &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i,&lt;/math&gt; ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''. These roots can be solved for [[algebraic expression|algebraically]] if ''n'' ≤ 4, but [[Abel–Ruffini theorem|not necessarily otherwise]]. If the solution is to be used numerically, all the roots of this characteristic equation can be found by [[numerical methods]]. However, for use in a theoretical context it may be that the only information required about the roots is whether any of them are greater than or equal to 1 in [[absolute value]].

It may be that all the roots are [[real number|real]] or instead there may be some that are [[complex number]]s. In the latter case, all the complex roots come in [[complex conjugate]] pairs.

===Solution with distinct characteristic roots===

If no characteristic roots share the same value, the solution of the homogeneous linear difference equation &lt;math&gt;x_t= a_1x_{t-1} + \cdots + a_nx_{t-n} &lt;/math&gt; can be written in terms of the characteristic roots as

:&lt;math&gt;x_t=c_1\lambda_1^t +\cdots + c_n\lambda_n^t,&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be found by invoking the initial conditions. Specifically, for each time period for which an iterate value is known, this value and its corresponding value of ''t'' can be substituted into the solution equation to obtain a linear equation in the ''n'' as-yet-unknown parameters; ''n'' such equations, one for each initial condition, can be [[system of linear equations|solved simultaneously]] for the ''n'' parameter values. If all characteristic roots are real, then all the coefficient values ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; will also be real; but with non-real complex roots, in general some of these coefficients will also be non-real.

====Converting complex solution to trigonometric form====

If there are complex roots, they come in pairs and so do the complex terms in the solution equation. If two of these complex terms are &lt;math&gt;c_j\lambda_j^t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; c_{j+1}\lambda_{j+1}^t,&lt;/math&gt; the roots &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_j, \lambda_{j+1}=\alpha \pm \beta i =M\left(\frac{\alpha}{M} \pm \frac{\beta}{M}i\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the non-subscript ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]] and ''M'' is the [[absolute value|modulus]] of the roots: &lt;math&gt;M=\sqrt{\alpha^2+\beta^2}.&lt;/math&gt; Then the two complex terms in the solution equation can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
c_j\lambda_j^t+c_{j+1}\lambda_{j+1}^t &amp; = M^t\left(c_j\left(\frac{\alpha}{M}+\frac{\beta}{M}i\right)^t + c_{j+1}\left(\frac{\alpha}{M}-\frac{\beta}{M}i\right)^t\right) \\[6pt]
&amp; = M^t[c_j(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)^t + c_{j+1}(\cos \theta - i\sin\theta)^t] \\[6pt]
&amp; = M^t[c_j(\cos(\theta t) + i\sin(\theta t)) + c_{j+1}(\cos(\theta t) -i\sin(\theta t)) ],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle whose cosine is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\alpha}{M}&lt;/math&gt; and whose sine is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\beta}{M};&lt;/math&gt; the last equality here made use of [[de Moivre's formula]].

Now the process of finding the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt; guarantees that they are also complex conjugates, which can be written as &lt;math&gt;\gamma \pm \delta i.&lt;/math&gt; Using this in the last equation gives this expression for the two complex terms in the solution equation:

:&lt;math&gt;2M^t\left(\gamma \cos(\theta t) - \delta \sin(\theta t)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

which can also be written as

:&lt;math&gt;2\sqrt{\gamma^2+\delta^2}M^t \cos(\theta t + \psi)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the angle whose cosine is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\gamma}{\sqrt{\gamma^2+\delta^2}}&lt;/math&gt; and whose sine is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\delta}{\sqrt{\gamma^2+\delta^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Cyclicality====

Depending on the initial conditions, even with all roots real the iterates can experience a transitory tendency to go above and below the steady state value. But true cyclicality involves a permanent tendency to fluctuate, and this occurs if there is at least one pair of complex conjugate characteristic roots. This can be seen in the trigonometric form of their contribution to the solution equation, involving &lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta t).&lt;/math&gt;

===Solution with duplicate characteristic roots===

In the second-order case, if the two roots are identical (&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1=\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;), they can both be denoted as &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and a solution may be of the form

:&lt;math&gt;x_t= c_1\lambda^t + c_2t\lambda^t.&lt;/math&gt;

===Conversion to homogeneous form===

If ''b'' ≠ 0, the equation

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = a_1y_{t-1} + \cdots + a_ny_{t-n} + b&lt;/math&gt;

is said to be non-homogeneous. To solve this equation it is convenient to convert it to homogeneous form, with no constant term. This is done by first finding the equation's ''steady state value''—a value ''y'' * such that, if ''n'' successive iterates all had this value, so would all future values. This value is found by setting all values of ''y'' equal to ''y'' * in the difference equation, and solving, thus obtaining

:&lt;math&gt;y^* = \frac{b}{1-a_1-\cdots - a_n},&lt;/math&gt;

assuming the denominator is not 0. If it is zero, the steady state does not exist.

Given the steady state, the difference equation can be rewritten in terms of deviations of the iterates from the steady state, as

:&lt;math&gt;(y_t -y^*)= a_1(y_{t-1}-y^*) + \cdots + a_n(y_{t-n}-y^*),&lt;/math&gt;

which has no constant term, and which can be written more succinctly as

:&lt;math&gt;x_t= a_1x_{t-1} + \cdots + a_nx_{t-n} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'' equals ''y''–''y'' *. This is the homogeneous form.

If there is no steady state, the difference equation

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = a_1y_{t-1} + \cdots + a_ny_{t-n} + b&lt;/math&gt;

can be combined with its equivalent form

:&lt;math&gt;y_{t-1}= a_1y_{t-2}+ \cdots + a_ny_{t-(n+1)}+ b&lt;/math&gt;

to obtain (by solving both for ''b'')

:&lt;math&gt;y_t - a_1y_{t-1} - \cdots - a_ny_{t-n} = y_{t-1}- a_1y_{t-2}- \cdots - a_ny_{t-(n+1)},&lt;/math&gt;

in which like terms can be combined to give a homogeneous equation of one order higher than the original.

==Stability==

In the solution equation &lt;math&gt;x_t=c_1\lambda_1^t +\cdots + c_n\lambda_n^t,&lt;/math&gt; a term with real characteristic roots converges to 0 as ''t'' grows indefinitely large if the absolute value of the characteristic root is less than 1. If the absolute value equals 1, the term will stay constant as ''t'' grows if the root is +1 but will fluctuate between two values if the root is –1. If the absolute value of the root is greater than 1 the term will become larger and larger over time. A pair of terms with complex conjugate characteristic roots will converge to 0 with dampening fluctuations if the absolute value of the modulus ''M'' of the roots is less than 1; if the modulus equals 1 then constant amplitude fluctuations in the combined terms will persist; and if the modulus is greater than 1, the combined terms will show fluctuations of ever-increasing magnitude.

Thus the evolving variable ''x'' will converge to 0 if all of the characteristic roots have magnitude less than 1. 

If the largest root has absolute value 1, neither convergence to 0 nor divergence to infinity will occur. If all roots with magnitude 1 are real and positive, ''x'' will converge to the sum of their constant terms &lt;math&gt;c_i;&lt;/math&gt; unlike in the stable case, this converged value depends on the initial conditions: different starting points lead to different points in the long run. If any root is –1, its term will contribute permanent fluctuations between two values. If any of the unit-magnitude roots are complex then constant-amplitude fluctuations of ''x'' will persist. 

Finally, if any characteristic root has magnitude greater than 1, then ''x'' will diverge to infinity as time goes to infinity, or will fluctuate between increasingly large positive and negative values.

A theorem of [[Issai Schur]] states that all roots have magnitude less than 1 (the stable case) if and only if a particular string of [[determinant (mathematics)|determinants]] are all positive.&lt;ref name=Baumol/&gt;{{rp|p. 247}}

If a non-homogeneous linear difference equation has been converted to homogeneous form which has been analyzed as above, then the stability and cyclicality properties of the original non-homogeneous equation will be the same as those of the derived homogeneous form, with convergence in the stable case being to the steady-state value ''y''* instead of to 0.

==Solution by conversion to matrix form==

An alternative solution method involves converting the ''n''-th order difference equation to a first-order [[matrix difference equation]]. This is accomplished by writing &lt;math&gt;w_{1,t} = y_t,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;w_{2,t} = y_{t-1} = w_{1, t-1},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;w_{3, t} = y_{t-2} = w_{2, t-1},&lt;/math&gt; etc. Then the original single ''n''-th order equation

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = a_1y_{t-1} + a_2y_{t-2} + \cdots + a_ny_{t-n} + b&lt;/math&gt;

can be replaced by this set of ''n'' first-order equations:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
w_{1, t} &amp; = a_1w_{1, t-1} + a_2w_{2, t-1}+\cdots + a_nw_{n, t-1} + b \\
w_{2, t} &amp; = w_{1, t-1} \\
&amp; \,\,\,\vdots \\
w_{n,t} &amp; =w_{n-1, t-1}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Writing the vector &lt;math&gt;(w_1 \ w_2 \ \cdots \ w_n)^T&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;w, &lt;/math&gt; this can be put in matrix form as

:&lt;math&gt; w_t= Aw_{t-1}+B.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''A'' is a matrix in which each row after the first has a single 1 with all other elements being 0, and ''B'' is a column vector with first element ''b'' and with the rest of its elements being 0.

This matrix equation can be solved using the methods in the article [[Matrix difference equation]].

==Statement and derivation==
Let {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} be functions, with {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}} constants. Now consider:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mbox{d}}{\mbox{d} x} ( \alpha \cdot f(x) + \beta \cdot g(x) ) &lt;/math&gt;

By the [[sum rule in differentiation]], this is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mbox{d}}{\mbox{d} x} ( \alpha \cdot f(x) ) + \frac{\mbox{d}}{\mbox{d} x} (\beta \cdot g(x))&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[constant factor rule in differentiation]], this reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \cdot f'(x) + \beta \cdot g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

This in turn leads to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mbox{d}}{\mbox{d} x}(\alpha \cdot f(x) + \beta \cdot g(x)) = \alpha \cdot f'(x) + \beta \cdot g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Omitting the [[Bracket (mathematics)#Functions|bracket]]s, this is often written as:

:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha \cdot f + \beta \cdot g)' = \alpha \cdot f'+ \beta \cdot g'&lt;/math&gt;

'''Michael Henry Albert''' (born September 20, 1962) is a mathematician and computer scientist, originally from [[Canada]], and currently a professor and the head of the computer science department at the [[University of Otago]] in [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]]. His varied research interests include [[combinatorics]] and [[combinatorial game theory]].

He received his [[B.Math]] in 1981 from the [[University of Waterloo]]. In that year Albert received the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], and he completed his [[D. Phil.]] in 1984 at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=phd&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=40885}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to the University of Waterloo. From 1987 to 1996 he was a professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Albert has been at the University of Otago since 1998.

Together with J.P. Grossman and Richard Nowakowski, Albert invented the game [[Clobber]].&lt;ref name=clob&gt;''[https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-clobbered Getting Clobbered]'' article at ''[[Science News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Albert has also contributed to the [[Combinatorial Game Suite]] game analysis software, and is a coauthor of ''Lessons in Play: An Introduction to Combinatorial Game Theory''.&lt;ref name=itcgt&gt;{{cite book |author1=Michael H.

By the end of the 5-year programme NQIT aims to produce the Q20:20 engine, a demonstration of a scalable quantum computer demonstrator comprising an optically-linked network of 20 cells, each cell being a quantum processor with 20 matter [[qubit]]s.

==Organisation==
The UK National Quantum Technologies Programme was initiated by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[George Osborne]] in the [[Autumn Statement]] in 2013 in which he pledged a £270 million investment.&lt;ref name="PhysicsWorld"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=Hamish |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2014/nov/26/uk-unveils-GBP120m-quantum-technology-hubs |title=UK unveils £120m quantum-technology hubs |work=[[Physics World]] |publisher=[[Institute of Physics]] |date=2014-11-26 |accessdate=2016-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A £120 million national network of four Quantum Technology Hubs was announced by [[Greg Clark]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="EPSRCpress"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/quantumtechhubs/ |title=Quantum Leap as Clark unveils UK's network of Quantum Technology Hubs |publisher=[[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] |date=2014-11-26 |accessdate=2016-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NQIT Hub is led by a Director, Professor [[Ian Walmsley]], who provides overall leadership and scientific vision, and two Co-Directors, Professor Dominic O’Brien, who leads the Systems Engineering, and Dr Tim Cook, who leads the Industrial User Engagement activities.

NQIT is led by the [[University of Oxford]] and academic partners are the [[University of Bath]], the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Edinburgh]], the [[University of Leeds]], the [[University of Southampton]], the [[University of Strathclyde]], the [[University of Sussex]] and the [[University of Warwick]].&lt;ref name="PhysicsWorld"/&gt;

Within the University of Oxford, NQIT works across the Departments of [[Department of Physics, University of Oxford|Physics]], [[Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford|Engineering]], [[Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford|Computer Science]] and [[Department of Materials, University of Oxford|Materials]].

NQIT works with 30 industrial and government partners, including Aspen Electronics, the [[Centre for Quantum Technologies]], Covesion Ltd, the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]], [[Element Six]], [[ETSI]], the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications]], [[Google]], [[Lockheed Martin]], [[M Squared Lasers]], the UK [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]], Oxford Capital, [[Oxford Instruments]], Pure Lifi, [[Raytheon]] UK, [[Rohde &amp; Schwarz]], Satellite Applications Catapult and [[Toshiba]].&lt;ref name="Partners"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nqit.ox.ac.uk/Partners |title=Partners |publisher=NQIT |accessdate=2016-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Q20:20==
NQIT's principal goal is to implement the Q20:20 engine:&lt;ref name="NewsEvents"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2014-11-26-oxford-lead-uk-quantum-computer-drive |title=Oxford to lead UK quantum computer drive |work=News and Events |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |date=2014-11-26 |accessdate=2016-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a hybrid matter/optical quantum computer involving twenty optically linked nodes, where each node is a small quantum processor of twenty qubits.  Each processing node will be an [[ion trap]],&lt;ref name="PhysOrg"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2015-12-rese-hybrid-logic-gate-quantum.html |title=Rese demonstrates 'hybrid' logic gate as work towards quantum computer continues |work=[[Phys.org]] |date=2015-12-16 |accessdate=2016-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; within which a small number of [[ion]]s are held suspended in a vacuum and manipulated by [[laser]] and [[microwave]] systems.  Each qubit is implemented within the internal [[hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] states of each ion, and control of the qubits is achieved optically via integrated lasers and through microwave manipulation.  Quantum interlinks between the traps will be realized by single [[photon]] emissions, which are combined and measured by [[optical fiber|optical fibres]], splitters, switches and detectors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2956">'''Nicolaus II Bernoulli''', a.k.a. '''Niklaus Bernoulli''', '''Nikolaus Bernoulli''', (6 February 1695, [[Basel]], [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]] – 31 July 1726, [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]]) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]  [[mathematician]] as were his father [[Johann Bernoulli]] and one of his brothers, [[Daniel Bernoulli]].  He was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the [[Bernoulli family]].

[[File:Bernoulli Nicolaus(II).jpeg|thumb|Nicolaus II Bernoulli, portrait by [[Johann Rudolf Huber]] (1723).]]

Nicolaus worked mostly on [[curve]]s, [[differential equation]]s, and [[probability]]. He was a friend and contemporary of [[Leonhard Euler]], who studied under Nicolaus' father.  He also contributed to [[fluid dynamics]].

He was older brother of [[Daniel Bernoulli]], to whom he also taught mathematics.  Even in his youth he had learned several languages. From the age of 13, he studied mathematics and law at the [[University of Basel]]. In 1711 he received his Master's of Philosophy; in 1715 he received a Doctorate in Law. In 1716-17 he was a private tutor in [[Venice]]. From 1719 he had the Chair in Mathematics at the [[University of Padua]], as the successor of [[Giovanni Poleni]]. He served as an assistant to his father, among other areas, in the correspondence over the priority dispute between [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and also in the priority dispute between his father and the English mathematician [[Brook Taylor]]. In 1720 he posed the problem of reciprocal [[orthogonal trajectories]], which was intended as a challenge for the English Newtonians. From 1723 he was a law professor at the Berner Oberen Schule. In 1725 he together with his brother Daniel, with whom he was touring Italy and France at this time, was invited by [[Peter the Great]] to the newly founded [[St. Petersburg Academy]]. Eight months after his appointment he came down with a fever and died. His professorship was succeeded in 1727 by [[Leonhard Euler]], whom the Bernoulli brothers had recommended.  His early death cut short a promising career.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2659">In [[mathematics]], a '''nonhypotenuse number''' is a [[natural number]] whose square ''cannot'' be written as the sum of two nonzero squares. The name stems from the fact that an edge of length equal to a nonhypotenuse number ''cannot'' form the [[hypotenuse]] of a [[Pythagorean triple|right angle triangle with integer sides]].

The numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 are all nonhypotenuse numbers. The number 5, however, is ''not'' a nonhypotenuse number as 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; equals 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The first fifty nonhypotenuse numbers are:
:1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 36, 38, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 54, 56, 57, 59, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 69, 71, 72, 76, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84  {{OEIS|id=A004144}}

Although nonhypotenuse numbers are common among small integers, they become more-and-more sparse for larger numbers. Yet, there are infinitely many nonhypotenuse numbers, and the number of nonhypotenuse numbers not exceeding a value ''x'' scales asymptotically with ''x''/{{radic|log ''x''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=D. S.|last2=Beiler|first2=Albert H.|title=Albert Beiler, ''Consecutive Hypotenuses of Pythagorean Triangles''|jstor=2004563|journal=[[Mathematics of Computation]]|volume=22|issue=103|year=1968|pages=690–692|doi=10.2307/2004563}}. This review of a manuscript of Beiler's (which was later published in ''J. Rec. Math.'' '''7''' (1974) 120–133, {{MR|0422125}}) attributes this bound to Landau.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nonhypotenuse numbers are those numbers that have no [[prime factor]]s of [[Pythagorean prime|the form 4''k''+1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=D.|last=Shanks|authorlink=Daniel Shanks|title=Non-hypotenuse numbers|journal=[[Fibonacci Quarterly]]|volume=13|issue=4|year=1975|pages=319–321|mr=0387219}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalently, any number that cannot be put into the form &lt;math&gt;K(m^2+n^2)&lt;/math&gt; where ''K'', ''m'', and ''n'' are all positive integers, is never a nonhypotenuse number. A number whose prime factors are not {{em|all}} of the form 4''k''+1 cannot be the hypotenuse of a primitive triangle, but may still be the hypotenuse of a non-primitive triangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beiler|first1=Albert|title=Recreations in the Theory of Numbers: The Queen of Mathematics Entertains|date=1966|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-21096-4|page=116-117|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''parallel operator''' &lt;math&gt;\|&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced "parallel") is a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] which is used especially as shorthand in [[electrical engineering]]. It represents the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] value of a sum of reciprocal values and is defined by:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rlcl}
\|:\ &amp; \overline{\mathbb{C}} \times \overline{\mathbb{C}} &amp;\to&amp; \overline{\mathbb{C}}\\
&amp; (a,b) &amp;\mapsto&amp; a \| b = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt; 

That is, it gives half of the [[harmonic mean]] of two numbers a and b.

'''Paul Frederick Linden''' (born 29 January 1947) {{post-nominals|size=100%|country=GBR|FRS|FRMetS}} is a [[mathematician]] specialising in [[fluid dynamics]]. He was the third [[G. I. Taylor Professor of Fluid Mechanics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a fellow of [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing College]].&lt;ref name="whoswho" /&gt; 

==Education==
Linden earned his PhD from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1972, under the supervision of [[Stewart Turner]]. His thesis was entitled ''The Effect of Turbulence and Shear on Salt Fingers''.&lt;ref name="GNP" /&gt;

== Awards and honours ==
Linden was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2007|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2007]].&lt;ref name="FRS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/people/paul-linden-11822|title=Paul Linden|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London}} One or more of the preceding sentences may incorporate text from the royalsociety.org website where "all text published under the heading 'Biography' on Fellow profile pages is available under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]]." {{cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/about-us/terms-conditions-policies/ |title=Royal Society Terms, conditions and policies |accessdate=2016-03-09 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220093712/https://royalsociety.org/about-us/terms-conditions-policies/ |archivedate=February 20, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His certificate of election reads: {{centered pull quote|Linden is world renowned for his laboratory experiments and theoretical analyses of fluid flows relevant to [[oceanography]], [[meteorology]] and environmental and industrial problems. He has demonstrated great skill and originality in isolating the basic physical processes underlying a diverse range phenomena. His studies of [[Double diffusive convection|double-diffusive]] [[convection|convective]] processes have shown how they influence the development of density structures in the [[ocean]]. His research on stably [[Stratification (water)|stratified]] [[turbulence]] has illuminated the mixing mechanisms at density interfaces, and the unifying concept of [[mixing efficiency]] which he introduced is now widely used to characterise stratified turbulence. He has also investigated instabilities of fronts and [[vortex|vortices]] in rotating, stratified flows and has  shown how these lead to the formation of stable vortex dipoles. Linden's work on gravity-driven flows has led to a better understanding of the formation of [[Front (oceanography)|fronts]] in the atmosphere and ocean, and it also has industrial applications. He has pioneered the current approach to modelling natural [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] flows in complex buildings. His concepts have already been used on a number of   prestigious projects, including the novel [[New York Times]] building. Linden has played a crucial role in stimulating the development of innovative imaging and measuring techniques which have had an important influence on experimental fluid dynamics worldwide.&lt;ref name="frsCitation"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27EC%2F2007%2F27%27%29 |title = EC/2007/27: Linden, Paul Fredrick|publisher=[[The Royal Society]]|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica''''' ([[Latin]] for ''Mathematical Principles of [[Natural Philosophy]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|place=London|contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/369153/The-Mathematical-Principles-of-Natural-Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; often referred to as simply the '''''Principia''''' {{IPAc-en|p|r|ɪ|n|ˈ|s|ɪ|p|i|ə}}, is a work in three books by [[Isaac Newton]], in Latin, first published 5 July 1687.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Motte /&gt; After annotating and correcting his personal copy of the first edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Newton's personally annotated 1st edition)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-ADV-B-00039-00001/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton published two further editions, in 1713 and 1726.&lt;ref name=variorum /&gt; The ''Principia'' states [[Newton's laws of motion]], forming the foundation of [[classical mechanics]]; [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]; and a derivation of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] (which [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] first obtained [[Empiricism|empirically]]).

The ''Principia'' is considered one of the most important works in the history of science.&lt;ref&gt;J M Steele, University of Toronto, [http://www.cap.ca/brms/Reviews/Reading-Steele.html (review online from [[Canadian Association of Physicists]])] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401071521/http://www.cap.ca/brms/Reviews/Reading-Steele.html |date=1 April 2010 }} of N Guicciardini's "Reading the Principia: The Debate on Newton’s Mathematical Methods for Natural Philosophy from 1687 to 1736" (Cambridge UP, 1999), a book which also states (summary before title page) that the "Principia" "is considered one of the masterpieces in the history of science".&lt;/ref&gt;

The French mathematical physicist [[Alexis Clairaut]] assessed it in 1747: "The famous book of ''Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'' marked the epoch of a great revolution in physics. The method followed by its illustrious author Sir Newton ... spread the light of mathematics on a science which up to then had remained in the darkness of conjectures and hypotheses."&lt;ref&gt;(in French) Alexis Clairaut, "Du systeme du monde, dans les principes de la gravitation universelle", in "Histoires (&amp; Memoires) de l'Academie Royale des Sciences" for 1745 (published 1749), at p.329 (according to a note on p.329, Clairaut's paper was read at a session of November 1747).&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent assessment has been that while acceptance of Newton's theories was not immediate, by the end of a century after publication in 1687, "no one could deny that" (out of the ''Principia'') "a science had emerged that, at least in certain respects, so far exceeded anything that had ever gone before that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of science generally."&lt;ref&gt;G E Smith, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/newton-principia/ "Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition), E N Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

In formulating his physical theories, Newton developed and used mathematical methods now included in the field of [[calculus]]. But the language of calculus as we know it was largely absent from the ''Principia''; Newton gave many of his proofs in a [[geometry|geometric]] form of [[infinitesimal calculus]], based on limits of ratios of vanishing small geometric quantities.&lt;ref name="geomcalc"/&gt; In a revised conclusion to the ''Principia'' (see ''[[#General Scholium|General Scholium]]''), Newton used his expression that became famous, ''[[Hypotheses non fingo]]'' ("I formulate no hypotheses"&lt;ref name="gschol-hnf"/&gt;).

===Expressed aim and topics covered===
[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|Sir [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) author of the ''Principia'']]
In the preface of the ''Principia'', Newton wrote:&lt;ref&gt;From Motte's translation of 1729 (at 3rd page of Author's Preface); and see also [[J. W. Herivel]], ''The background to Newton's "Principia"'', Oxford University Press, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|[...] Rational Mechanics will be the sciences of motion resulting from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any motion, accurately proposed and demonstrated [...] And therefore we offer this work as mathematical principles of his philosophy. For all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this—from the phenomenas of motions to investigate the forces of Nature, and then from these forces to demonstrate the other phenomena [...]}}

The ''Principia'' deals primarily with massive bodies in motion, initially under a variety of conditions and hypothetical laws of force in both non-resisting and resisting media, thus offering criteria to decide, by observations, which laws of force are operating in phenomena that may be observed. It attempts to cover hypothetical or possible motions both of celestial bodies and of terrestrial projectiles. It explores difficult problems of motions perturbed by multiple attractive forces. Its third and final book deals with the interpretation of observations about the movements of planets and their satellites.

It shows:
*how astronomical observations prove the inverse square law of gravitation (to an accuracy that was high by the standards of Newton's time); 
*offers estimates of relative masses for the known giant planets and for the Earth and the Sun; 
*defines the very slow motion of the Sun relative to the solar-system barycenter; 
*shows how the theory of gravity can account for irregularities in the motion of the Moon; 
*identifies the oblateness of the figure of the Earth; 
*accounts approximately for marine tides including phenomena of spring and neap tides by the perturbing (and varying) gravitational attractions of the Sun and Moon on the Earth's waters; 
*explains the [[Axial_precession#Polar_shift_and_equinoxes_shift|precession of the equinoxes]] as an effect of the gravitational attraction of the Moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge; and 
*gives theoretical basis for numerous phenomena about comets and their elongated, near-parabolic orbits.

The opening sections of the ''Principia'' contain, in revised and extended form, nearly&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'' article indicates the topics that reappear in the ''Principia.''&lt;/ref&gt; all of the content of Newton's 1684 tract ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]''.

The ''Principia'' begin with "Definitions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=1|chapter=Definitions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Axioms or Laws of Motion",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=19|chapter=Axioms or Laws of Motion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA19|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues in three books:

===Book 1, ''De motu corporum''===
Book 1, subtitled ''De motu corporum'' (''On the motion of bodies'') concerns motion in the absence of any resisting medium.  It opens with a mathematical exposition of "the method of first and last ratios",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=41|chapter=Section I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA41|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; a geometrical form of infinitesimal calculus.&lt;ref name=geomcalc /&gt;

[[Image:Newtons proof of Keplers second law.gif|right|thumb|300px|Newton's proof of Kepler's second law, as described in the book. If a continuous centripetal force (red arrow) is considered on the planet during its orbit, the area of the triangles defined by the path of the planet will be the same. This is true for any fixed time interval. When the interval tends to zero, the force can be considered instantaneous. (Click image for a detailed description).]]
The second section establishes relationships between centripetal forces and the law of areas now known as Kepler's second law (Propositions 1–3),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=57|chapter=Section II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA57|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relates circular velocity and radius of path-curvature to radial force&lt;ref&gt;This relationship between circular curvature, speed and radial force, now often known as Huygens' formula, was independently found by Newton (in the 1660s) and by Huygens in the 1650s: the conclusion was published (without proof) by Huygens in 1673.This was given by Isaac Newton through his Inverse Square Law.&lt;/ref&gt; (Proposition 4), and relationships between centripetal forces varying as the inverse-square of the distance to the center and orbits of conic-section form (Propositions 5–10).

Propositions 11–31&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=79–153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA79|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|last2=Machin|first2=John|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; establish properties of motion in paths of eccentric conic-section form including ellipses, and their relation with inverse-square central forces directed to a focus, and include [[Newton's theorem about ovals]] (lemma 28).

Propositions 43–45&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=177|chapter=Section IX|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA178-IA1|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; are demonstration that in an eccentric orbit under centripetal force where the [[apsis|apse]] may move, a steady non-moving orientation of the line of apses is an indicator of an inverse-square law of force.

Book 1 contains some proofs with little connection to real-world dynamics. But there are also sections with far-reaching application to the solar system and universe:

Propositions 57–69&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=218|chapter=Section XI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA218|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; deal with the "motion of bodies drawn to one another by centripetal forces". This section is of primary interest for its application to the solar system, and includes Proposition 66&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=234|chapter=Section XI, Proposition LXVI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA234|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with its 22 corollaries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=239–256|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA239|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|last2=Machin|first2=John|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; here Newton took the first steps in the definition and study of the problem of the movements of three massive bodies subject to their mutually perturbing gravitational attractions, a problem which later gained name and fame (among other reasons, for its great difficulty) as the [[three-body problem]].

Propositions 70–84&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=263|chapter=Section XII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA263|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; deal with the attractive forces of spherical bodies. The section contains Newton's proof that a massive spherically symmetrical body attracts other bodies outside itself as if all its mass were concentrated at its centre. This fundamental result, called the [[Shell theorem]], enables the inverse square law of gravitation to be applied to the real solar system to a very close degree of approximation.

===Book 2===
Part of the contents originally planned for the first book was divided out into a second book, which largely concerns motion through resisting mediums. Just as Newton examined consequences of different conceivable laws of attraction in Book 1, here he examines different conceivable laws of resistance; thus &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1846)/BookII-I|Section 1]]&lt;/span&gt; discusses resistance in direct proportion to velocity, and &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1846)/BookII-II|Section 2]]&lt;/span&gt; goes on to examine the implications of resistance in proportion to the square of velocity. Book 2 also discusses (in &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1846)/BookII-V|Section 5]]&lt;/span&gt;) hydrostatics and the properties of compressible fluids. The effects of air resistance on pendulums are studied in &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1846)/BookII-VI|Section 6]]&lt;/span&gt;, along with Newton's account of experiments that he carried out, to try to find out some characteristics of air resistance in reality by observing the motions of pendulums under different conditions. Newton compares the resistance offered by a medium against motions of globes with different properties (material, weight, size). In Section 8, he derives rules to determine the speed of waves in fluids and relates them to the density and condensation(Proposition 48;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=176|chapter=Proposition 48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA176|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; this would become very important in acoustics). He assumes that these rules apply equally to light and sound and estimates that the speed of sound is around 1088 feet per second and can increase depending on the amount of water in air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=181|chapter=Scholium to proposition 50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA181|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less of Book 2 has stood the test of time than of Books 1 and 3, and it has been said that Book 2 was largely written on purpose to refute a theory of [[René Descartes|Descartes]] which had some wide acceptance before Newton's work (and for some time after). According to this Cartesian theory of vortices, planetary motions were produced by the whirling of fluid vortices that filled interplanetary space and carried the planets along with them.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J Aiton, ''The Cartesian vortex theory'', chapter 11 in ''Planetary astronomy from the Renaissance to the rise of astrophysics, Part A: Tycho Brahe to Newton'', eds. R Taton &amp; C Wilson, Cambridge (Cambridge University press) 1989; at pp. 207–221.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton wrote at the end of Book 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=197|chapter=Scholium to proposition 53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA197|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; his conclusion that the hypothesis of vortices was completely at odds with the astronomical phenomena, and served not so much to explain as to confuse them.

===Book 3, ''De mundi systemate''===
Book 3, subtitled ''De mundi systemate'' (''On the system of the world''), is an exposition of many consequences of universal gravitation, especially its consequences for astronomy. It builds upon the propositions of the previous books, and applies them with further specificity than in Book 1 to the motions observed in the solar system. Here (introduced by Proposition 22,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA252|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing in Propositions 25–35&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA262|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are developed [[Lunar theory#Newton|several of the features and irregularities]] of the orbital motion of the Moon, especially the [[Variation (astronomy)|variation]]. Newton lists the astronomical observations on which he relies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=206|chapter=The Phaenomena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA206|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establishes in a stepwise manner that the inverse square law of mutual gravitation applies to solar system bodies, starting with the satellites of Jupiter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=213|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA213|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and going on by stages to show that the law is of universal application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA220|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gives starting at Lemma 4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA323|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Proposition 40&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=332|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA332|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theory of the motions of comets, for which much data came from [[John Flamsteed]] and [[Edmond Halley]], and accounts for the tides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA255|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempting quantitative estimates of the contributions of the Sun&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=305|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA305|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA306|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the tidal motions; and offers the first theory of the precession of the equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=320|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA320|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Book 3 also considers the [[harmonic oscillator]] in three dimensions, and motion in arbitrary force laws.

In Book 3 Newton also made clear his heliocentric view of the solar system, modified in a somewhat modern way, since already in the mid-1680s he recognised the "deviation of the Sun" from the centre of gravity of the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;See Curtis Wilson, "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", pages 233–274 in R Taton &amp; C Wilson (eds) (1989) ''The General History of Astronomy'', Volume, 2A', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA233 at page 233]).&lt;/ref&gt; For Newton, "the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=233|chapter=Proposition 12, Corollary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA233|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that this centre "either is at rest, or moves uniformly forward in a right line".&lt;ref name=prop11&gt;{{cite book|page=232|chapter=Proposition 11 &amp; preceding Hypothesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA232|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton rejected the second alternative after adopting the position that "the centre of the system of the world is immoveable", which "is acknowledg'd by all, while some contend that the Earth, others, that the Sun is fix'd in that centre".&lt;ref name=prop11/&gt; Newton estimated the mass ratios Sun:Jupiter and Sun:Saturn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=228|chapter=Proposition 8, Corollary 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA228|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pointed out that these put the centre of the Sun usually a little way off the common center of gravity, but only a little, the distance at most "would scarcely amount to one diameter of the Sun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=232–233|chapter=Proposition 12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA232|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}} Newton's position is seen to go beyond literal Copernican heliocentrism practically to the modern position in regard to the solar system barycenter (see ''[[Barycenter#Inside or outside the Sun.3F|Barycenter -- Inside or outside the Sun?]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary on the ''Principia''===
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2018}}
The sequence of definitions used in setting up dynamics in the ''Principia'' is recognisable in many textbooks today. Newton first set out the definition of mass

{{quotation|The quantity of matter is that which arises conjointly from its density and magnitude. A body twice as dense in double the space is quadruple in quantity. This quantity I designate by the name of body or of mass.}}

This was then used to define the "quantity of motion" (today called [[momentum]]), and the principle of inertia in which mass replaces the previous Cartesian notion of ''intrinsic force''. This then set the stage for the introduction of forces through the change in momentum of a body. Curiously, for today's readers, the exposition looks dimensionally incorrect, since Newton does not introduce the dimension of time in rates of changes of quantities.

He defined space and time "not as they are well known to all". Instead, he defined "true" time and space as "absolute"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 Extract of page 30]&lt;/ref&gt; and explained:

{{quotation|Only I must observe, that the vulgar conceive those quantities under no other notions but from the relation they bear to perceptible objects. And it will be convenient to distinguish them into absolute and relative, true and apparent, mathematical and common. [...] instead of absolute places and motions, we use relative ones; and that without any inconvenience in common affairs; but in philosophical discussions, we ought to step back from our senses, and consider things themselves, distinct from what are only perceptible measures of them.}}

To some modern readers it can appear that some dynamical quantities recognised today were used in the ''Principia'' but not named. The mathematical aspects of the first two books were so clearly consistent that they were easily accepted; for example, [[John Locke|Locke]] asked [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] whether he could trust the mathematical proofs, and was assured about their correctness.

However, the concept of an attractive force acting at a distance received a cooler response. In his notes, Newton wrote that the inverse square law arose naturally due to the structure of matter. However, he retracted this sentence in the published version, where he stated that the motion of planets is consistent with an inverse square law, but refused to speculate on the origin of the law. Huygens and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] noted that the law was incompatible with the notion of the [[aether (classical element)|aether]]. From a Cartesian point of view, therefore, this was a faulty theory. Newton's defence has been adopted since by many famous physicists—he pointed out that the mathematical form of the theory had to be correct since it explained the data, and he refused to speculate further on the basic nature of gravity. The sheer number of phenomena that could be organised by the theory was so impressive that younger "philosophers" soon adopted the methods and language of the ''Principia''.

===Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy===
Perhaps to reduce the risk of public misunderstanding, Newton included at the beginning of Book 3 (in the second (1713) and third (1726) editions) a section entitled "Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy." In the four rules, as they came finally to stand in the 1726 edition, Newton effectively offers a methodology for handling unknown phenomena in nature and reaching towards explanations for them. The four Rules of the 1726 edition run as follows (omitting some explanatory comments that follow each):

Rule 1: ''We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.''

Rule 2: ''Therefore to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.''

Rule 3: ''The qualities of bodies, which admit neither intensification nor remission of degrees, and which are found to belong to all bodies within the reach of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal qualities of all bodies whatsoever.''

Rule 4: ''In experimental philosophy we are to look upon propositions inferred by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true, not withstanding any contrary hypothesis that may be imagined, till such time as other phenomena occur, by which they may either be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions.''

This section of Rules for philosophy is followed by a listing of 'Phenomena', in which are listed a number of mainly astronomical observations, that Newton used as the basis for inferences later on, as if adopting a consensus set of facts from the astronomers of his time.

Both the 'Rules' and the 'Phenomena' evolved from one edition of the ''Principia'' to the next. Rule 4 made its appearance in the third (1726) edition; Rules 1–3 were present as 'Rules' in the second (1713) edition, and predecessors of them were also present in the first edition of 1687, but there they had a different heading:  they were not given as 'Rules', but rather in the first (1687) edition the predecessors of the three later 'Rules', and of most of the later 'Phenomena', were all lumped together under a single heading 'Hypotheses' (in which the third item was the predecessor of a heavy revision that gave the later Rule 3).

From this textual evolution, it appears that Newton wanted by the later headings 'Rules' and 'Phenomena' to clarify for his readers his view of the roles to be played by these various statements.

In the third (1726) edition of the ''Principia'', Newton explains each rule in an alternative way and/or gives an example to back up what the rule is claiming.  The first rule is explained as a philosophers' principle of economy.  The second rule states that if one cause is assigned to a natural effect, then the same cause so far as possible must be assigned to natural effects of the same kind:  for example respiration in humans and in animals, fires in the home and in the Sun, or the reflection of light whether it occurs terrestrially or from the planets.  An extensive explanation is given of the third rule, concerning the qualities of bodies, and Newton discusses here the generalisation of observational results, with a caution against making up fancies contrary to experiments, and use of the rules to illustrate the observation of gravity and space.

Isaac Newton’s statement of the four rules revolutionised the investigation of phenomena. With these rules, Newton could in principle begin to address all of the world’s present unsolved mysteries.  He was able to use his new analytical method to replace that of Aristotle, and he was able to use his method to tweak and update [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]’s experimental method. The re-creation of Galileo's method has never been significantly changed and in its substance, scientists use it today.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===General Scholium===
{{Main|General Scholium}}
The ''General Scholium'' is a concluding essay added to the second edition, 1713 (and amended in the third edition, 1726).&lt;ref&gt;See online ''Principia'' (1729 translation) vol.2, Books 2 &amp; 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA387 starting at page 387 of volume 2 (1729)].&lt;/ref&gt; It is not to be confused with the ''General Scholium'' at the end of Book 2, Section 6, which discusses his pendulum experiments and resistance due to air, water, and other fluids.

Here Newton used what became his famous expression '''[[Hypotheses non fingo]]''', "I formulate no hypotheses",&lt;ref name=gschol-hnf /&gt; in response to criticisms of the first edition of the ''Principia''. (''&lt;nowiki&gt;'Fingo'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' is sometimes nowadays translated 'feign' rather than the traditional 'frame'.) Newton's gravitational attraction, an invisible [[Action at a distance (physics)|force able to act over vast distances]], had led to criticism that he had introduced "[[occult]] agencies" into science.&lt;ref name="Edelglass p. 54"&gt;Edelglass et al., ''Matter and Mind'', {{ISBN|0-940262-45-2}}, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton firmly rejected such criticisms and wrote that it was enough that the phenomena implied gravitational attraction, as they did; but the phenomena did not so far indicate the cause of this gravity, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things not implied by the phenomena: such hypotheses "have no place in experimental philosophy", in contrast to the proper way in which "particular propositions are inferr'd from the phenomena and afterwards rendered general by induction".&lt;ref&gt;See online ''Principia'' (1729 translation) vol.2, Books 2 &amp; 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA392 at page 392 of volume 2 (1729)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton also underlined his criticism of the vortex theory of planetary motions, of Descartes, pointing to its incompatibility with the highly eccentric orbits of comets, which carry them "through all parts of the heavens indifferently".

Newton also gave theological argument. From the system of the world, he inferred the existence of a Lord God, along lines similar to what is sometimes called the [[Teleological argument|argument from intelligent or purposive design]]. It has been suggested that Newton gave "an oblique argument for a unitarian conception of God and an implicit attack on the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]",&lt;ref name="The General Scholium to Isaac Newton's ''Principia mathematica''"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ducheyne | first =Steffen | authorlink = | title =The General Scholium: Some notes on Newton's published and unpublished endeavours | journal=Lias: Sources and Documents Relating to the Early Modern History of Ideas |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=223–274 | url =http://logica.ugent.be/steffen/GS.pdf  | accessdate =19 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the General Scholium appears to say nothing specifically about these matters.

==Writing and publication==

===Halley and Newton's initial stimulus===
In January 1684, [[Edmond Halley]], [[Christopher Wren]] and [[Robert Hooke]] had a conversation in which Hooke claimed to not only have derived the inverse-square law, but also all the laws of planetary motion. Wren was unconvinced, Hooke did not produce the claimed derivation although the others gave him time to do it, and Halley, who could derive the inverse-square law for the restricted circular case (by substituting Kepler's relation into Huygens' formula for the centrifugal force) but failed to derive the relation generally, resolved to ask Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrase of 1686 report by Halley, in H. W. Turnbull (ed.), 'Correspondence of Isaac Newton', Vol.2, cited above, pp. 431–448.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halley's visits to Newton in 1684 thus resulted from Halley's debates about planetary motion with Wren and Hooke, and they seem to have provided Newton with the incentive and spur to develop and write what became ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica''. Halley was at that time a Fellow and Council member of the [[Royal Society]] in London (positions that in 1686 he resigned to become the Society's paid Clerk).&lt;ref&gt;'Cook, 1998': A. Cook, ''Edmond Halley, Charting the Heavens and the Seas'', Oxford University Press 1998, at pp.147 and 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Halley's visit to Newton in Cambridge in 1684 probably occurred in August.&lt;ref&gt;As dated e.g. by D. T. Whiteside, in ''The Prehistory of the Principia from 1664 to 1686'', Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, 45 (1991) 11–61.&lt;/ref&gt; When Halley asked Newton's opinion on the problem of planetary motions discussed earlier that year between Halley, Hooke and Wren,&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 1998; at p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton surprised Halley by saying that he had already made the derivations some time ago; but that he could not find the papers. (Matching accounts of this meeting come from Halley and [[Abraham De Moivre]] to whom Newton confided.) Halley then had to wait for Newton to 'find' the results, but in November 1684 Newton sent Halley an amplified version of whatever previous work Newton had done on the subject. This took the form of a 9-page manuscript, ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'' (''Of the motion of bodies in an orbit''): the title is shown on some surviving copies, although the (lost) original may have been without title.

Newton's tract ''De motu corporum in gyrum'', which he sent to Halley in late 1684, derived what are now known as the three laws of Kepler, assuming an inverse square law of force, and generalised the result to conic sections. It also extended the methodology by adding the solution of a problem on the motion of a body through a resisting medium. The contents of ''De motu'' so excited Halley by their mathematical and physical originality and far-reaching implications for astronomical theory, that he immediately went to visit Newton again, in November 1684, to ask Newton to let the Royal Society have more of such work.&lt;ref&gt;'Westfall, 1980': R S Westfall, ''Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton'', Cambridge University Press 1980, at p.404.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of their meetings clearly helped to stimulate Newton with the enthusiasm needed to take his investigations of mathematical problems much further in this area of physical science, and he did so in a period of highly concentrated work that lasted at least until mid-1686.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 1998; at p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's single-minded attention to his work generally, and to his project during this time, is shown by later reminiscences from his secretary and copyist of the period, Humphrey Newton. His account tells of Isaac Newton's absorption in his studies, how he sometimes forgot his food, or his sleep, or the state of his clothes, and how when he took a walk in his garden he would sometimes rush back to his room with some new thought, not even waiting to sit before beginning to write it down.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, 1980; at p. 406, also pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other evidence also shows Newton's absorption in the ''Principia'': Newton for years kept up a regular programme of chemical or alchemical experiments, and he normally kept dated notes of them, but for a period from May 1684 to April 1686, Newton's chemical notebooks have no entries at all.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, 1980; at p.406, n.15.&lt;/ref&gt;  So it seems that Newton abandoned pursuits to which he was normally dedicated, and did very little else for well over a year and a half, but concentrated on developing and writing what became his great work.

The first of the three constituent books was sent to Halley for the printer in spring 1686, and the other two books somewhat later.  The complete work, published by Halley at his own financial risk,&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, 1980; at pp. 153–156.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in July 1687.  Newton had also communicated ''De motu'' to Flamsteed, and during the period of composition he exchanged a few letters with Flamsteed about observational data on the planets, eventually acknowledging Flamsteed's contributions in the published version of the ''Principia'' of 1687.

===Preliminary version===
[[Image:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] own first edition copy of his ''Principia'', with handwritten corrections for the second edition.]]
The process of writing that first edition of the ''Principia'' went through several stages and drafts:  some parts of the preliminary materials still survive, while others are lost except for fragments and cross-references in other documents.&lt;ref&gt;The fundamental study of Newton's progress in writing the ''Principia'' is in I. Bernard Cohen's ''Introduction to Newton's 'Principia' '', (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1971), at part 2: "The writing and first publication of the 'Principia' ", pp.47–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving materials show that Newton (up to some time in 1685) conceived his book as a two-volume work. The first volume was to be titled ''De motu corporum, Liber primus'', with contents that later appeared in extended form as Book 1 of the ''Principia''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A fair-copy draft of Newton's planned second volume ''De motu corporum, Liber secundus'' survives, its completion dated to about the summer of 1685.  It covers the application of the results of ''Liber primus'' to the Earth, the Moon, the tides, the solar system, and the universe; in this respect it has much the same purpose as the final Book 3 of the ''Principia'', but it is written much less formally and is more easily read.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Manchester John Rylands Library Isaac Newton 16-10-2009 13-54-26.JPG|thumb|left|Titlepage and frontispiece of the third edition, London, 1726 ([[John Rylands Library]])]]
It is not known just why Newton changed his mind so radically about the final form of what had been a readable narrative in ''De motu corporum, Liber secundus'' of 1685, but he largely started afresh in a new, tighter, and less accessible mathematical style, eventually to produce Book 3 of the ''Principia'' as we know it. Newton frankly admitted that this change of style was deliberate when he wrote that he had (first) composed this book "in a popular method, that it might be read by many", but to "prevent the disputes" by readers who could not "lay aside the[ir] prejudices", he had "reduced" it "into the form of propositions (in the mathematical way) which should be read by those only, who had first made themselves masters of the principles established in the preceding books".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=200|chapter=Introduction to Book 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA200|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final Book 3 also contained in addition some further important quantitative results arrived at by Newton in the meantime, especially about the theory of the motions of comets, and some of the perturbations of the motions of the Moon.

The result was numbered Book 3 of the ''Principia'' rather than Book 2, because in the meantime, drafts of ''Liber primus'' had expanded and Newton had divided it into two books. The new and final Book 2 was concerned largely with the motions of bodies through resisting mediums.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

But the ''Liber secundus'' of 1685 can still be read today. Even after it was superseded by Book 3 of the ''Principia'', it survived complete, in more than one manuscript. After Newton's death in 1727, the relatively accessible character of its writing encouraged the publication of an English translation in 1728 (by persons still unknown, not authorised by Newton's heirs). It appeared under the English title ''A Treatise of the System of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEYUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR1|title=A Treatise of the System of the World|author1=Newton|first1=Isaac|date=1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had some amendments relative to Newton's manuscript of 1685, mostly to remove cross-references that used obsolete numbering to cite the propositions of an early draft of Book 1 of the ''Principia''. Newton's heirs shortly afterwards published the Latin version in their possession, also in 1728, under the (new) title ''De Mundi Systemate'', amended to update cross-references, citations and diagrams to those of the later editions of the ''Principia'', making it look superficially as if it had been written by Newton after the ''Principia'', rather than before.&lt;ref&gt;I. Bernard Cohen, ''Introduction'' to Newton's ''A Treatise of the System of the World'' (facsimile of second English edition of 1731), London (Dawsons of Pall Mall) 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''System of the World'' was sufficiently popular to stimulate two revisions (with similar changes as in the Latin printing), a second edition (1731), and a 'corrected' reprint&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02xbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP7|title=The System of the World: Demonstrated in an Easy and Popular Manner.

===Halley's role as publisher===
The text of the first of the three books of the ''Principia'' was presented to the [[Royal Society]] at the close of April 1686. Hooke made some priority claims (but failed to substantiate them), causing some delay. When Hooke's claim was made known to Newton, who hated disputes, Newton threatened to withdraw and suppress Book 3 altogether, but Halley, showing considerable diplomatic skills, tactfully persuaded Newton to withdraw his threat and let it go forward to publication. [[Samuel Pepys]], as President, gave his [[imprimatur]] on 30 June 1686, licensing the book for publication. The Society had just spent its book budget on a ''[[De Historia piscium|History of Fishes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Westfall (1980), ''Never at Rest'', p. 453, {{ISBN|0-521-27435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cost of publication was borne by [[Edmund Halley]] (who was also then acting as publisher of the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society''): the book appeared in summer 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/archive/exhibits/pepys/pages/largeImage.asp?id=101&amp;size=3&amp;nav=none |title=Museum of London exhibit including facsimile of title page from John Flamsteed's copy of 1687 edition of Newton's '&amp;#39;Principia'&amp;#39; |publisher=Museumoflondon.org.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331192529/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/archive/exhibits/pepys/pages/largeImage.asp?id=101&amp;size=3&amp;nav=none |archivedate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

===Beginnings of the Scientific Revolution===
[[File:Nikolaus Kopernikus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543) was the first person to formulate a comprehensive [[Heliocentricism|heliocentric]] (or [[Sun]]-centered) model of the universe]]
[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] had moved the Earth away from the center of the universe with the [[heliocentric]] theory for which he presented evidence in his book ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the revolutions of the heavenly spheres'') published in 1543. The structure was completed when [[Johannes Kepler]] wrote the book ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' (''A new astronomy'') in 1609, setting out the evidence that planets move in [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits with the sun at one [[Focus (geometry)|focus]], and that planets do not move with constant speed along this orbit. Rather, their speed varies so that the line joining the centres of the sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. To these two laws he added a third a decade later, in his book ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (''Harmonies of the world''). This law sets out a proportionality between the third power of the characteristic distance of a planet from the sun and the square of the length of its year.

[[File:Justus Sustermans - Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636.jpg|thumb|Italian physicist [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), a champion of the Copernican model of the universe and an enormously influential figure in the history of kinematics and classical mechanics]]The foundation of modern dynamics was set out in Galileo's book ''[[Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo]]'' (''Dialogue on the two main world systems'') where the notion of inertia was implicit and used. In addition, Galileo's experiments with inclined planes had yielded precise mathematical relations between elapsed time and acceleration, velocity or distance for uniform and uniformly accelerated motion of bodies.

Descartes' book of 1644 ''[[Principia philosophiae]]'' (''Principles of philosophy'') stated that bodies can act on each other only through contact: a principle that induced people, among them himself, to hypothesize a universal medium as the carrier of interactions such as light and gravity—the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]. Newton was criticized for apparently introducing forces that acted at distance without any medium.&lt;ref name="Edelglass p. 54"/&gt; Not until the development of [[particle theory]] was Descartes' notion vindicated when it was possible to describe all interactions, like the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]], and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[fundamental interaction]]s, using mediating [[gauge boson]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Henryk Niewodniczanski Institute of Nuclear Physics|title=Particle Physics and Astrophysics Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gravity through hypothesized [[gravitons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Rovelli|first1=Carlo|title=Notes for a brief history of quantum gravity|eprint=gr-qc/0006061|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was mistaken in his treatment of circular motion, this effort was more fruitful in the short term when it led others to identify circular motion as a problem raised by the principle of inertia. [[Christiaan Huygens]] solved this problem in the 1650s and published it much later in 1673 in his book ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium|Horologium oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum]]''.

===Newton's role===
Newton had studied these books, or, in some cases, secondary sources based on them, and taken notes entitled ''[[Quaestiones quaedam philosophicae]]'' (''Questions about philosophy'') during his days as an undergraduate. During this period (1664–1666) he created the basis of calculus, and performed the first experiments in the optics of colour. At this time, his proof that white light was a combination of primary colours (found via prismatics) replaced the prevailing theory of colours and received an overwhelmingly favourable response, and occasioned bitter disputes with [[Robert Hooke]] and others, which forced him to sharpen his ideas to the point where he already composed sections of his later book ''[[Opticks]]'' by the 1670s in response. Work on calculus is shown in various papers and letters, including two to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. He became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and the second [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] (succeeding [[Isaac Barrow]]) at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

===Newton's early work on motion===
In the 1660s Newton studied the motion of colliding bodies, and deduced that the centre of mass of two colliding bodies remains in uniform motion. Surviving manuscripts of the 1660s also show Newton's interest in planetary motion and that by 1669 he had shown, for a circular case of planetary motion, that the force he called 'endeavour to recede' (now called [[centrifugal force]]) had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.&lt;ref name="T Whiteside 1991 pages 11–61"/&gt; After his 1679–1680 correspondence with Hooke, described below, Newton adopted the language of inward or centripetal force. According to Newton scholar J Bruce Brackenridge, although much has been made of the change in language and difference of point of view, as between centrifugal or centripetal forces, the actual computations and proofs remained the same either way. They also involved the combination of tangential and radial displacements, which Newton was making in the 1660s. The difference between the centrifugal and centripetal points of view, though a significant change of perspective, did not change the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See J. Bruce Brackenridge, "The key to Newton's dynamics: the Kepler problem and the Principia", (University of California Press, 1995), especially at [https://books.google.com/books?id=ovOTK7X_mMkC&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pages 20–21].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also clearly expressed the concept of linear inertia in the 1660s: for this Newton was indebted to Descartes' work published 1644.&lt;ref name="dtw1970"/&gt;

===Controversy with Hooke===
[[File:13 Portrait of Robert Hooke.JPG|thumb|Artist's impression of English polymath [[Robert Hooke]] (1635–1703).]]
Hooke published [[Robert Hooke#Gravitation|his ideas about gravitation]] in the 1660s and again in 1674. He argued for an attracting principle of gravitation in ''[[Micrographia]]'' of 1665, in a 1666 Royal Society lecture ''On gravity'', and again in 1674, when he published his ideas about the ''System of the World'' in somewhat developed form, as an addition to ''An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations''.&lt;ref name="attempt"/&gt; Hooke clearly postulated mutual attractions between the Sun and planets, in a way that increased with nearness to the attracting body, along with a principle of linear inertia. Hooke's statements up to 1674 made no mention, however, that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions. Hooke's gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;See page 239 in Curtis Wilson (1989), "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", ch.13 (pages 233–274) in "Planetary astronomy from the Renaissance to the rise of astrophysics: 2A: Tycho Brahe to Newton", CUP 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hooke also did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration.  On these two aspects, Hooke stated in 1674: "Now what these several degrees [of gravitational attraction] are I have not yet experimentally verified" (indicating that he did not yet know what law the gravitation might follow); and as to his whole proposal: "This I only hint at present", "having my self many other things in hand which I would first compleat, and therefore cannot so well attend it" (i.e., "prosecuting this Inquiry").&lt;ref name=attempt /&gt;

In November 1679, Hooke began an exchange of letters with Newton, of which the full text is now published.&lt;ref name="167986letters"/&gt;  Hooke told Newton that Hooke had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence,&lt;ref&gt;'Correspondence' vol.2 already cited, at p.297.&lt;/ref&gt; and wished to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others;  and as if to whet Newton's interest, he asked what Newton thought about various matters, giving a whole list, mentioning "compounding the celestial motions of the planets of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body", and "my hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse", and then a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions (which Hooke described at length), and then efforts to carry out or improve national surveys, the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge, and other items. Newton's reply offered "a fansy of my own" about a terrestrial experiment (not a proposal about celestial motions) which might detect the Earth's motion, by the use of a body first suspended in air and then dropped to let it fall.  The main point was to indicate how Newton thought the falling body could experimentally reveal the Earth's motion by its direction of deviation from the vertical, but he went on hypothetically to consider how its motion could continue if the solid Earth had not been in the way (on a spiral path to the centre). Hooke disagreed with Newton's idea of how the body would continue to move.&lt;ref&gt;Several commentators have followed Hooke in calling Newton's spiral path mistaken, or even a 'blunder', but there are also the following facts: (a) that Hooke left out of account Newton's specific statement that the motion resulted from dropping "a heavy body suspended in the Air" (i.e. a resisting medium), see Newton to Hooke, 28 November 1679, document #236 at page 301, 'Correspondence' vol.2 cited above, and compare Hooke's report to the Royal Society on 11 December 1679 where Hooke reported the matter "supposing no resistance", see D Gjertsen, 'Newton Handbook' (1986), at page 259); and (b) that Hooke's reply of 9 December 1679 to Newton considered the cases of motion both with and without air resistance: The resistance-free path was what Hooke called an 'elliptueid'; but a line in Hooke's diagram showing the path for his case of air resistance was, though elongated, also another inward-spiralling path ending at the Earth's centre: Hooke wrote "where the Medium ... has a power of impeding and destroying its motion the curve in wch it would move would be some what like the Line AIKLMNOP &amp;c and ... would terminate in the center C". Hooke's path including air resistance was therefore to this extent like Newton's (see 'Correspondence' vol.2, cited above, at pages 304–306, document #237, with accompanying figure). The diagrams are also available online: see Curtis Wilson, chapter 13 in "Planetary Astronomy from the Renaissance to the Rise of Astrophysics, Part A, Tycho Brahe to Newton", (Cambridge UP 1989), at page 241 showing [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA241 Newton's 1679 diagram] with spiral, and extract of his letter; also at page 242 showing [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA242 Hooke's 1679 diagram] including two paths, closed curve and spiral. Newton pointed out in his later correspondence over the priority claim that the descent in a spiral "is true in a resisting medium such as our air is", see 'Correspondence', vol.2 cited above, at page 433, document #286.&lt;/ref&gt; A short further correspondence developed, and towards the end of it Hooke, writing on 6 January 1680 to Newton, communicated his "supposition ... that the Attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the Distance from the Center Reciprocall, and Consequently that the Velocity will be in a subduplicate proportion to the Attraction and Consequently as Kepler Supposes Reciprocall to the Distance."&lt;ref&gt;See page 309 in 'Correspondence of Isaac Newton', Vol 2 cited above, at document #239.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hooke's inference about the velocity was actually incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;See Curtis Wilson (1989) at page 244.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1686, when the first book of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''Principia'' was presented to the [[Royal Society]], Hooke claimed that Newton had obtained from him the "notion" of "the rule of the decrease of Gravity, being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the Center". At the same time (according to [[Edmond Halley]]'s contemporary report) Hooke agreed that "the Demonstration of the Curves generated therby" was wholly Newton's.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

A recent assessment about the early history of the inverse square law is that "by the late 1660s," the assumption of an "inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons".&lt;ref&gt;See "Meanest foundations and nobler superstructures: Hooke, Newton and the 'Compounding of the Celestiall Motions of the Planetts'", Ofer Gal, 2003 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0nKYlXxIemoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false at page 9].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton himself had shown in the 1660s that for planetary motion under a circular assumption, force in the radial direction had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.&lt;ref name="T Whiteside 1991 pages 11–61"/&gt; Newton, faced in May 1686 with Hooke's claim on the inverse square law, denied that Hooke was to be credited as author of the idea, giving reasons including the citation of prior work by others before Hooke.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt; Newton also firmly claimed that even if it had happened that he had first heard of the inverse square proportion from Hooke, which it had not, he would still have some rights to it in view of his mathematical developments and demonstrations, which enabled observations to be relied on as evidence of its accuracy, while Hooke, without mathematical demonstrations and evidence in favour of the supposition, could only guess (according to Newton) that it was approximately valid "at great distances from the center".&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

The background described above shows there was basis for Newton to deny deriving the inverse square law from Hooke. On the other hand, Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all editions of the ''Principia'', that Hooke (but not exclusively Hooke) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system. Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 1729 English translation of the 'Principia', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66 at page 66].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also acknowledged to Halley that his correspondence with Hooke in 1679–80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters, but that did not mean, according to Newton, that Hooke had told Newton anything new or original: "yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things &amp; for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it ...".&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;)   Newton's reawakening interest in astronomy received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680/1681, on which he corresponded with [[John Flamsteed]].&lt;ref&gt;R S Westfall, 'Never at Rest', 1980, at pages 391–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1759, decades after the deaths of both Newton and Hooke, [[Alexis Clairaut]], mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies, made his assessment after reviewing what Hooke had published on gravitation.  "One must not think that this idea ... of Hooke diminishes Newton's glory", Clairaut wrote; "The example of Hooke" serves "to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated".&lt;ref&gt;The second extract is quoted and translated in W.W. Rouse Ball, "An Essay on Newton's 'Principia'" (London and New York: Macmillan, 1893), at page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original statements by Clairaut (in French) are found (with orthography here as in the original) in "Explication abregée du systême du monde, et explication des principaux phénomenes astronomiques tirée des Principes de M. Newton" (1759), at Introduction (section IX), page 6: "Il ne faut pas croire que cette idée ... de Hook diminue la gloire de M. Newton", [and] "L'exemple de Hook" [serves] "à faire voir quelle distance il y a entre une vérité entrevue &amp; une vérité démontrée".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later editions==
Two later editions were published by Newton:

===Second edition, 1713===
Newton had been urged to make a new edition of the ''Principia'' since the early 1690s, partly because copies of the first edition had already become very rare and expensive within a few years after 1687.&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.4, Cambridge University Press 1967, at pp.519, n.2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Newton referred to his plans for a second edition in correspondence with Flamsteed in November 1694:&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.4, Cambridge University press 1967, at p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also maintained annotated copies of the first edition specially bound up with interleaves on which he could note his revisions; two of these copies still survive:&lt;ref&gt;I Bernard Cohen, Introduction to the Principia, Cambridge 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; but he had not completed the revisions by 1708, and of two would-be editors, Newton had almost severed connections with one, [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]], and the other, [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]] seems not to have met with Newton's approval and was also terminally ill, dying later in 1708. Nevertheless, reasons were accumulating not to put off the new edition any longer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard S. Westfall]]. ''Never at Rest'': A Biography of Isaac Newton. Cambridge U. Press. 1980 {{ISBN|0-521-23143-4}}, at p.699.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Bentley]], master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], persuaded Newton to allow him to undertake a second edition, and in June 1708 Bentley wrote to Newton with a specimen print of the first sheet, at the same time expressing the (unfulfilled) hope that Newton had made progress towards finishing the revisions.&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.4, Cambridge University press 1967, at pp.518–20.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Bentley then realised that the editorship was technically too difficult for him, and with Newton's consent he appointed [[Roger Cotes]], Plumian professor of astronomy at Trinity, to undertake the editorship for him as a kind of deputy (but Bentley still made the publishing arrangements and had the financial responsibility and profit). The correspondence of 1709–1713 shows Cotes reporting to two masters, Bentley and Newton, and managing (and often correcting) a large and important set of revisions to which Newton sometimes could not give his full attention.&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.5, Cambridge University press 1975. Bentley's letter to Newton of October 1709 (at pp.&amp;nbsp;7–8) describes Cotes' perhaps unenviable position in relation to his master Bentley: "You need not be so shy of giving Mr. Cotes too much trouble: he has more esteem for you, and obligations to you, than to think that trouble too grievous: but however he does it at my Orders, to whom he owes more than that."&lt;/ref&gt; Under the weight of Cotes' efforts, but impeded by priority disputes between Newton and Leibniz,&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, pp.712–716.&lt;/ref&gt; and by troubles at the Mint,&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, pp.751–760.&lt;/ref&gt; Cotes was able to announce publication to Newton on 30 June 1713.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, p.750.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentley sent Newton only six presentation copies; Cotes was unpaid; Newton omitted any acknowledgement to Cotes.

Among those who gave Newton corrections for the Second Edition were: [[Firmin Abauzit]], Roger Cotes and David Gregory. However, Newton omitted acknowledgements to some because of the priority disputes. [[John Flamsteed]], the Astronomer Royal, suffered this especially.

The Second Edition was the basis of the first edition to be printed abroad, which appeared in Amsterdam in 1714.

===Third edition, 1726===
The third edition was published 25 March 1726, under the stewardship of ''[[Henry Pemberton]], M.D., a man of the greatest skill in these matters...''; Pemberton later said that this recognition was worth more to him than the two hundred guinea award from Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, p.802&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annotated and other editions===
In 1739–42, two French priests, Pères Thomas LeSeur and [[François Jacquier]] (of the [[Minim (religious order)|Minim]] order, but sometimes erroneously identified as Jesuits), produced with the assistance of [[Jean-Louis Calandrini|J.-L. Calandrini]] an extensively annotated version of the ''Principia'' in the 3rd edition of 1726. Sometimes this is referred to as the ''Jesuit edition'': it was much used, and reprinted more than once in Scotland during the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Facsimile"/&gt;

[[Émilie du Châtelet]] also made a translation of Newton's Principia into French. Unlike LeSeur and Jacquier's edition, hers was a complete translation of Newton's three books and their prefaces. She also included a Commentary section where she fused the three books into a much clearer and easier to understand summary. She included an analytical section where she applied the new mathematics of calculus to Newton's most controversial theories. Previously, geometry was the standard mathematics used to analyse theories. Du Châtelet's translation is the only complete one to have been done in French and hers remains the standard French translation to this day.&lt;ref&gt;See "Translating Newton's 'Principia': The Marquise du Châtelet's Revisions and Additions for a French Audience." Author(s): Judith P. Zinsser Source: ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 55, No. 2 (May 2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;227–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English translations===
Two full English translations of Newton's ''Principia'' have appeared, both based on Newton's 3rd edition of 1726.

The first, from 1729, by Andrew Motte,&lt;ref name="Motte"/&gt; was described by Newton scholar [[I. Bernard Cohen]] (in 1968) as "still of enormous value in conveying to us the sense of Newton's words in their own time, and it is generally faithful to the original: clear, and well written".&lt;ref&gt;I Bernard Cohen (1968), "Introduction" (at page i) to (facsimile) reprint of 1729 English translation of Newton's "Principia" (London (1968), Dawsons of Pall Mall).&lt;/ref&gt; The 1729 version was the basis for several republications, often incorporating revisions, among them a widely used modernised English version of 1934, which appeared under the editorial name of Florian Cajori (though completed and published only some years after his death). Cohen pointed out ways in which the 18th-century terminology and punctuation of the 1729 translation might be confusing to modern readers, but he also made severe criticisms of the 1934 modernised English version, and showed that the revisions had been made without regard to the original, also demonstrating gross errors "that provided the final impetus to our decision to produce a wholly new translation".&lt;ref&gt;See pages 29–37 in [[I. Bernard Cohen]] (1999), "A Guide to Newton's Principia", published as an introduction to "Isaac Newton: The Principia, Mathematical principles of natural philosophy, a new translation" by I Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, University of California Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second full English translation, into modern English, is the work that resulted from this decision by collaborating translators I. Bernard Cohen, Anne Whitman, and Julia Budenz; it was published in 1999 with a guide by way of introduction.&lt;ref&gt;''Isaac Newton: The Principia, Mathematical principles of natural philosophy, a new translation'' by I. Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, preceded by "A Guide to Newton's Principia" by I. Bernard Cohen, University of California Press, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-520-08816-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-08817-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

William H. Donahue has published a translation of the work's central argument, published in 1996, along with expansion of included proofs and ample commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Densmore and William H. Donahue, ''Newton's Principia: The Central Argument: Translation, Notes, and Expanded Proofs'' (Green Lion Press; 3rd edition, 2003) {{ISBN|978-1-888009-23-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-888009-23-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was developed as a textbook for classes at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] and the aim of this translation is to be faithful to the Latin text.&lt;ref&gt;Densmore and Donahue, pp. xv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homages===
In 2014, British [[astronaut]] [[Tim Peake]] named his upcoming mission to the [[International Space Station]] ''Principia'' after the book, in "honour of Britain's greatest scientist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28329097|title=Tim Peake mission name pays tribute to Isaac Newton|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Peake's ''Principia'' launched on December 15, 2015 aboard [[Soyuz TMA-19M]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2015/06/09/roscosmos-announces-new-soyuzprogress-launch-dates/?linkId=14819770|title=Roscosmos Announces New Soyuz/Progress Launch Dates|date=9 June 2015|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, the Pockels cell is acting as a quarter wave plate, where linearly polarized light is converted to circularly polarized light. With the addition of a Brewster window (on the left) this change in polarization can be converted to a change in the intensity of the beam, by transmitting on the p-polarized vector component.]]
The '''Pockels effect''' (after [[Friedrich Carl Alwin Pockels]] who studied the effect in 1893), or Pockels electro-optic effect, changes or produces [[birefringence]] in an optical medium induced by an [[electric field]]. In the Pockels effect, also known as the linear electro-optic effect, the birefringence is proportional to the electric field. In the [[Kerr effect]], the refractive index change (birefringence) is proportional to the square of the field. The Pockels effect occurs only in crystals that lack [[inversion symmetry]], such as [[lithium niobate]], and in other noncentrosymmetric media such as electric-field poled polymers or glasses.

==Pockels cells==
Pockels cells are voltage-controlled [[wave plate]]s. The Pockels effect is the basis of the operation of '''Pockels cells'''. Pockels cells may be used to rotate the polarization of a beam that passes through. See [[#Applications of Pockels cells|applications]] below for uses.

A transverse Pockels cell consists of two crystals in opposite orientation, which together give a zero-order wave plate when the voltage is turned off. This is often not perfect and drifts with temperature. But the mechanical alignment of the crystal axis is not so critical and is often done by hand without screws; while misalignment leads to some energy in the wrong ray (either ''e'' or ''o''{{spaced ndash}}for example, horizontal or vertical), in contrast to the longitudinal case, the loss is not amplified through the length of the crystal.

The electric field can be applied to the crystal medium either longitudinally or transversely to the light beam. Longitudinal Pockels cells need transparent or ring electrodes. Transverse voltage requirements can be reduced by lengthening the crystal.

Alignment of the crystal axis with the ray axis is critical. Misalignment leads to [[birefringence]] and to a large phase shift across the long crystal. This leads to [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] [[optical rotation|rotation]] if the alignment is not exactly parallel or perpendicular to the polarization.

=== Dynamics within the cell ===
Because of the high relative [[dielectric constant]] of ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 36 inside the crystal, changes in the electric field propagate at a speed of only ''c''/6. Fast non-fiber optic cells are thus embedded into a matched transmission line. Putting it at the end of a transmission line leads to reflections and doubled switching time. The signal from the driver is split into parallel lines that lead to both ends of the crystal. When they meet in the crystal, their voltages add up.
Pockels cells for [[optical fiber|fibre optics]] may employ a traveling wave design to reduce current requirements and increase speed.

Usable crystals also exhibit the [[piezoelectric effect]] to some degree&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Valasek, "Properties of Rochelle Salt Related to the Piezo-Electric Effect", ''Physical Review'', 1922, Vol XIX, No. 478&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Rubidium Titanyl Phosphate|RTP]] has the lowest, [[Beta barium borate|BBO]] and [[lithium niobate]] are high). After a voltage change, sound waves start propagating from the sides of the crystal to the middle. This is important not for [[pulse picker]]s, but for [[boxcar window]]s. Guard space between the light and the faces of the crystals needs to be larger for longer holding times.
Behind the sound wave the crystal stays deformed in the equilibrium position for the high electric field.
This increases the polarization. Due to the growing of the polarized volume the electric field in the crystal in front of the wave increases
linearly, or the driver has to provide a constant current leakage.

=== The driver electronics ===
The driver must withstand the doubled voltage returned to it.  Pockels cells behave like a [[capacitor]]. When switching these to high voltage, a high charge is needed; consequently, 3 ns switching requires about 40 A for a 5&amp;nbsp;mm aperture.
Shorter cables reduce the amount of charge wasted in transporting current to the cell.

The driver may employ many transistors connected parallel and serial.
The transistors are floating and need DC isolation for their gates.
To do this, the gate signal is connected via [[optical fiber]], or the gates are driven by a large [[transformer]].
In this case, careful compensation for feedback is needed to prevent oscillation.

The driver may employ a cascade of transistors and a triode.
In a classic, commercial circuit the last transistor is an IRF830 [[MOSFET]] and the triode is an Eimac Y690 [[triode]].
The setup with a single triode has the lowest capacity; this even justifies turning off the cell by applying the double voltage.
A resistor ensures the leakage current needed by the crystal and later to recharge the storage capacitor.
The Y690 switches up to 10 kV and the cathode delivers 40 A if the grid is on +400 V.
In this case the grid current is 8 A and the input impedance is thus 50 ohms, which matches standard [[coaxial cable]]s, and the MOSFET can thus be placed remotely. Some of the 50 ohms are spent on an additional resistor which pulls the bias on −100 V.
The IRF can switch 500 volts. It can deliver 18 A pulsed.
Its leads function as an inductance, a storage capacitor is employed, the 50 ohm coax cable is connected, the MOSFET has an internal resistance,
and in the end this is a [[critically damped]] [[RLC circuit]], which is fired by a pulse to the gate of the MOSFET.

The gate needs 5 V pulses (range: ±20 V) while provided with 22 nC.
Thus the current gain of this transistor is one for 3 ns switching, but it still has voltage gain.
Thus it could theoretically also be used in [[common gate]] configuration and not in [[common source]] configuration.
Transistors, which switch 40 V are typically faster, so in the previous stage a current gain is possible.

==Applications of Pockels cells==
Pockels cells are used in a variety of scientific and technical applications. A Pockels cell, combined with a polarizer, can be used for switching between no optical rotation and 90° rotation creates a fast shutter capable of "opening" and "closing" in [[nanosecond]]s. The same technique can be used to impress information on the beam by modulating the rotation between 0° and 90°; the exiting beam's [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]], when viewed through the polarizer, contains an [[amplitude modulation|amplitude-modulated]] signal. This modulated signal can be used for time-resolved electric field measurements when a crystal is exposed to an unknown electric field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Consoli|first1=F.|last2=De Angelis|first2=R.|last3=Duvillaret|first3=L.|last4=Andreoli|first4=P.

Pockels cells are used for preventing the [[feedback]] of a [[laser]] [[optical cavity|cavity]] by using a [[polarizer#Beam-splitting polarizers|polarizing prism]]. This prevents optical amplification by directing light of a certain polarization out of the cavity. Because of this, the [[gain medium]] is pumped to a highly excited state. When the medium has become saturated by energy, the Pockels cell is switched, and the intracavity light is allowed to exit. This creates a very fast, high-intensity pulse. [[Q-switching]], [[chirped pulse amplification]], and [[Q-switching#Variants|cavity dumping]] use this technique.

Pockels cells can be used for [[quantum key distribution]] by [[Photon polarization|polarizing]] [[photon]]s.

Pockels cells in conjunction with other EO elements can be combined to form electro-optic probes.

A Pockels cell was used by MCA Disco-Vision ([[DiscoVision]]) engineers in the optical videodisc mastering system. Light from an argon-ion laser was passed through the Pockels cell to create pulse modulations corresponding to the original FM video and audio signals to be recorded on the master videodisc. MCA used the Pockels cell in videodisc mastering until the sale to Pioneer Electronics. To increase the quality of the recordings, MCA patented a Pockels cell stabilizer that reduced the second-harmonic distortion that could be created by the Pockels cell during mastering. MCA used either a DRAW (Direct Read After Write) mastering system or a photoresist system. The DRAW system was originally preferred, since it didn't require clean-room conditions during disc recording and allowed instant quality checking during mastering. The original single-sided test pressings from 1976/77 were mastered with the DRAW system as were the "educational", non-feature titles at the format's release in December 1978.

Pockels cells are used in [[two-photon microscopy]].

==Statement of Theorem==

''Definition.'' Let &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth map between manifolds. We say that a point &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt; is a ''regular value of f'' if for all &lt;math&gt;x \in f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; the map &lt;math&gt;df_x: T_xX \to T_yY&lt;/math&gt; is [[surjective map|surjective]]. Here, &lt;math&gt;T_xX&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_yY&lt;/math&gt; are the [[tangent space]]s of X and Y at the points x and y.


''Theorem.'' Let &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth map, and let &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt; be a regular value of ''f''; then &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; is a submanifold of X. If  &lt;math&gt;y \in \text{im}(f)&lt;/math&gt;,  then the [[codimension]] of &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the dimension of Y. Also,  the [[tangent space]] of &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; at  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt; \ker(df_x)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20439">In [[number theory]], the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]], like the [[Pythagorean theorem]], has lent itself to an unusual number of [[mathematical proof|proofs]].  Several hundred '''proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity''' have been found.

==Proofs that are accessible==

Of relatively elementary, combinatorial proofs, there are two which apply types of [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting]]. One by [[Gotthold Eisenstein]] counts [[lattice point]]s. Another applies [[Zolotarev's lemma]] to &lt;math&gt;(\Bbb{Z}/pq\Bbb{Z})^{\times} &lt;/math&gt; ''expressed by the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] as'' &lt;math&gt;(\Bbb{Z} /p \Bbb{Z})^{\times} \times (\Bbb{Z} /q \Bbb{Z})^{\times}&lt;/math&gt; ''and calculates the [[signature of a permutation]].''

== Eisenstein's proof ==

Eisenstein's proof of quadratic reciprocity is a simplification of Gauss's third proof. It is more geometrically intuitive and requires less technical manipulation.

The point of departure is "Eisenstein's lemma", which states that for distinct odd primes ''p'', ''q'',
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac qp\right) = (-1)^{\sum_u \left \lfloor qu/p \right \rfloor},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\left \lfloor x \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[floor function]] (the largest integer less than or equal to ''x''), and where the sum is taken over the ''even'' integers ''u'' = 2, 4, 6, ..., ''p''−1. For example,
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac 7{11}\right) = (-1)^{ \left \lfloor 14/11 \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor 28/11 \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor 42/11 \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor 56/11 \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor 70/11 \right \rfloor } = (-1)^{1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6} = (-1)^{17} = -1.&lt;/math&gt;
This result is very similar to [[Gauss's lemma (number theory)|Gauss's lemma]], and can be proved in a similar fashion (proof given below).

Using this representation of (''q''/''p''), the main argument is quite elegant. The sum &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_u \left \lfloor qu/p \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of lattice points with even ''x''-coordinate in the interior of the triangle ABC in the following diagram:

|| [[File:Eisenstein-quadratic-reciprocity-2.svg|300px|none|thumb|Example showing lattice points inside ABC with even ''x''-coordinates, for ''p'' = 11 and ''q'' = 7]]
|}

Because each column has an even number of points (namely ''q''−1 points), the number of such lattice points in the region BCYX is the same ''modulo 2'' as the number of such points in the region CZY:

[[File:Eisenstein-quadratic-reciprocity-3.svg|300px|thumb|none|The number of points with even ''x''-coordinate inside BCYX (marked by O's) is equal modulo 2 to the number of such points in CZY (marked by X's)]]

Then by flipping the diagram in both axes, we see that the number of points with even ''x''-coordinate inside CZY is the same as the number of points inside AXY having ''odd'' ''x''-coordinates:

[[File:Eisenstein-quadratic-reciprocity-4.svg|300px|thumb|none|The number of points with even ''x''-coordinate inside CZY is equal to the number of points with ''odd'' ''x''-coordinate inside AXY]]

The conclusion is that
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac qp\right) = (-1)^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;
where μ is the ''total'' number of lattice points in the interior of AYX. Switching ''p'' and ''q'', the same argument shows that
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac pq\right) = (-1)^\nu,&lt;/math&gt;
where ν is the number of lattice points in the interior of WYA. Since there are no lattice points on the line AY itself (because ''p'' and ''q'' are [[relatively prime]]), and since the total number of points in the rectangle WYXA is
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p-1}2\right) \left(\frac{q-1}2\right),&lt;/math&gt;
we obtain finally
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac qp\right) \left(\frac pq\right) = (-1)^{\mu + \nu} = (-1)^{(p-1)(q-1)/4}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof of Eisenstein's lemma ===

For an even integer ''u'' in the range 1 ≤ ''u'' ≤ ''p''−1, denote by ''r''(''u'') the least positive residue of ''qu'' modulo ''p''. (For example, for ''p'' = 11, ''q'' = 7, we allow ''u'' = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and the corresponding values of ''r''(''u'') are 3, 6, 9, 1, 4.) The numbers (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''r''(''u'')&lt;/sup&gt;''r''(''u''), again treated as least positive residues modulo ''p'', are all ''even'' (in our running example, they are 8, 6, 2, 10, 4.) Furthermore, they are all distinct, because if (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''r''(''u'')&lt;/sup&gt;''r''(''u'') ≡ (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''r''(''t'')&lt;/sup&gt;''r''(''t'') (mod ''p''), then we may divide out by ''q'' to obtain ''u'' ≡ ±''t'' (mod ''p''). This forces ''u'' ≡ ''t'' (mod ''p''), because both ''u'' and ''t'' are ''even'', whereas ''p'' is odd. Since there exactly (''p''−1)/2 of them and they are distinct, they must be simply a rearrangement of the even integers 2, 4, ..., ''p''−1. Multiplying them together, we obtain
: &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{r(2)}2q \cdot (-1)^{r(4)}4q \cdot \cdots \cdot (-1)^{r(p-1)}(p-1)q \equiv 2 \cdot 4 \cdot \cdots \cdot (p-1)\pmod{p}.&lt;/math&gt;
Dividing out successively by 2, 4, ..., ''p''−1 on both sides (which is permissible since none of them are divisible by ''p'') and rearranging, we have
: &lt;math&gt;q^{(p-1)/2} \equiv (-1)^{r(2) + r(4) + \cdots + r(p-1)}\pmod{p}.&lt;/math&gt;
On the other hand, by the definition of ''r''(''u'') and the floor function,
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{qu}p = \left \lfloor \frac{qu}p\right \rfloor + \frac{r(u)}p,&lt;/math&gt;
and so since ''p'' is odd and ''u'' is even, we see that &lt;math&gt;\left \lfloor qu/p \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; and ''r''(''u'') are congruent modulo 2. Finally this shows that
: &lt;math&gt;q^{(p-1)/2} \equiv (-1)^{\sum_u \left \lfloor qu/p \right \rfloor} \pmod{p}.&lt;/math&gt;
We are finished because the left hand side is just an [[Euler's criterion|alternative expression for (''q''/''p'')]].

== Proof using Quadratic Gauss Sums ==
The proof of Quadratic Reciprocity using Gauss sums is one of the more common and classic proofs. These proofs work by comparing computations of single values in two different ways, one using [[Euler's criterion|Euler's Criterion]] and the other using the [[Binomial theorem]]. As an example of how Euler's criterion is used, we can use it to give a quick proof of the first supplemental case of determining  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(\frac{-1}{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for an odd prime ''p'': By Euler's criterion  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(\frac{-1}{p}\right) \equiv (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt; , but since both sides of the equivalence are ±1 and ''p'' is odd, we can deduce that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(\frac{-1}{p}\right) = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The Second Supplemental Case  ===
Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\zeta_8 = e^{2\pi i/8}&lt;/math&gt;, a primitive 8th [[root of unity]] and set &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\tau = \zeta_8+\zeta_8^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\zeta_8^2 = i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\zeta_8^{-2}=-i&lt;/math&gt; we see that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\tau^{2} = 2&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is an algebraic integer, if ''p'' is an odd prime it makes sense to talk about it modulo ''p''. (Formally we are considering the commutative ring formed by factoring the algebraic integers &lt;math&gt; \mathbf A &lt;/math&gt; with the ideal generated by ''p''. Because &lt;math&gt; p^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; is not an algebraic integer, 1, 2, ..., ''p'' are distinct elements of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf A}/p{\mathbf A} &lt;/math&gt;.) Using Euler's criterion, it follows that &lt;math display="block"&gt;\tau^{p-1} =(\tau^2)^{\frac{p-1}{2}} = 2^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv \left(\frac{2}{p}\right) \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;We can then say that &lt;math display="block"&gt;\tau^p\equiv \left(\frac{2}{p}\right)\tau\pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;But we can also compute &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\tau^p \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt; using the binomial theorem. Because the cross terms in the binomial expansion all contain factors of ''p'', we find that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\tau^p\equiv \zeta_8^p+\zeta_8^{-p} \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;. We can evaluate this more exactly by breaking this up into two cases 
* &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p\equiv \pm 1\pmod{8} \Rightarrow \zeta_8^p+\zeta_8^{-p} = \zeta_8+\zeta_8^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. 
* &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p\equiv \pm 3 \pmod{8} \Rightarrow \zeta_8^p+\zeta_8^{-p} = -\zeta_8-\zeta_8^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. 
These are the only options for a prime modulo 8 and both of these cases can be computed using the exponential form &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\zeta_8=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{8}}&lt;/math&gt;. We can write this succinctly for all odd primes ''p'' as &lt;math display="block"&gt;\tau^p \equiv (-1)^{\frac{p^2-1}{8}}\tau \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;Combining these two expressions for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\tau^p\pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;  and multiplying through by &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; we find that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;2\cdot \left(\frac{2}{p}\right) \equiv 2\cdot(-1)^{\frac{p^2-1}{8}}\pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;. Since both &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(\frac{2}{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{\frac{p^2-1}{8}}&lt;/math&gt; are ±1 and 2 is invertible modulo ''p'', we can conclude that &lt;math display="block"&gt;\left(\frac{2}{p}\right) = (-1)^{\frac{p^2-1}{8}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== The general case ===
The idea for the general proof follows the above supplemental case: Find an algebraic integer that somehow encodes the Legendre symbols for ''p'', then find a relationship between Legendre symbols by computing the ''q''th power of this algebraic integer modulo ''q'' in two different ways, one using Euler's criterion the other using the binomial theorem.

Let &lt;math display="block"&gt;g_p = \sum_{k=1}^{p-1}\left(\frac{k}{p}\right)\zeta_p^k&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\zeta_p=e^{2\pi i/p}&lt;/math&gt; is a primitive ''p''th root of unity. This is a [[Quadratic Gauss sum|Quadratic Gauss Sum]]. A fundamental property of these Gauss sums is that &lt;math display="block"&gt;g_p^2 = p^*&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p^*=\left(\frac{-1}{p}\right) p&lt;/math&gt;. To put this in context of the next proof, the individual elements of the Gauss sum are in the cyclotomic field &lt;math&gt;L = \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)&lt;/math&gt; but the above formula shows that the sum itself is a generator of the unique quadratic field contained in ''L''. Again, since the quadratic Gauss sum is an algebraic integer, we can use modular arithmetic with it. Using this fundamental formula and Euler's criterion we find that&lt;math display="block"&gt;g_p^{q-1} = (g_p^2)^{\frac{q-1}{2}} = (p^*)^{\frac{q-1}{2}} \equiv \left(\frac{p^*}{q}\right)\pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt;Therefore&lt;math display="block"&gt;g_p^q \equiv \left(\frac{p^*}{q}\right)g_p\pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt;Using the binomial theorem, we also find that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g_p^q\equiv\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}\left(\frac{k}{p}\right)\zeta_p^{qk} \pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt;, If we let ''a'' be a multiplicative inverse of &lt;math&gt;q\pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;, then we can rewrite this sum as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)\sum_{t=1}^{p-1}\left(\frac{t}{p}\right)\zeta_p^t&lt;/math&gt; using the substitution &lt;math&gt;t=qk&lt;/math&gt;, which doesn't affect the range of the sum. Since &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, we can then write&lt;math display="block"&gt;g_p^q\equiv\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)g_p\pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt;Using these two expressions for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g_p^q \pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt;, and multiplying through by &lt;math&gt;g_p&lt;/math&gt; gives&lt;math display="block"&gt;\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)p^*\equiv \left(\frac{p^*}{q}\right)p^*\pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt;Since &lt;math&gt;p^*&lt;/math&gt; is invertible modulo ''q'', and the Legendre symbols are either ±1, we can then conclude that&lt;math display="block"&gt;\left(\frac{q}{p}\right) = \left(\frac{p^*}{q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Proof using algebraic number theory ==

The proof presented here is by no means the simplest known; however, it is quite a deep one, in the sense that it motivates some of the ideas of [[Artin reciprocity]].

=== Cyclotomic field setup ===

Suppose that ''p'' is an odd prime. The action takes place inside the [[cyclotomic field]]
&lt;math&gt;L = \mathbf Q(\zeta_p),&lt;/math&gt;
where ζ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is a primitive ''p''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[root of unity]]. The basic theory of cyclotomic fields informs us that there is a canonical isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;G = \operatorname{Gal}(L/\mathbf Q) \cong (\Z/p\Z)^\times&lt;/math&gt;
which sends the automorphism σ&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\sigma_a(\zeta_p) = \zeta_p^a&lt;/math&gt; to the element &lt;math&gt;a \in (\Z/p\Z)^\times.&lt;/math&gt; In particular, this isomorphism is injective because the [[multiplicative group]] of a field is a cyclic group: &lt;math&gt;F^\times\cong C_{p-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now consider the subgroup ''H'' of ''squares'' of elements of ''G''. Since ''G'' is cyclic, ''H'' has [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2 in ''G'', so the subfield corresponding to ''H'' under the Galois correspondence must be a ''quadratic'' extension of '''Q'''. (In fact it is the ''unique'' quadratic extension of '''Q''' contained in ''L''.) The [[Gaussian period]] theory determines which one; it turns out to be &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Q(\sqrt{p^*})&lt;/math&gt;, where
:&lt;math&gt;p^* = \left\{\begin{array}{rl} p &amp; \text{if } p \equiv 1\!\!\! \pmod{4}, \\ -p &amp; \text{if } p \equiv 3\!\!\! \pmod{4}. \end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

At this point we start to see a hint of quadratic reciprocity emerging from our framework. On one hand, the image of ''H'' in &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf Z/p\mathbf Z)^\times&lt;/math&gt; consists precisely of the (nonzero) ''quadratic residues modulo p''. On the other hand, ''H'' is related to an attempt to take the ''square root of p'' (or possibly of &amp;minus;''p''). In other words, if now ''q'' is a prime (different from ''p''), we have shown that
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac qp\right) =1 \quad \iff \quad \sigma_q \in H \quad \iff \quad \sigma_q \mbox{ fixes } \mathbf Q(\sqrt{p^*}).&lt;/math&gt;

=== The Frobenius automorphism ===

In the ring of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O_L=\mathbb Z[\zeta_p]&lt;/math&gt;, choose any unramified prime ideal β of lying over ''q'', and let &lt;math&gt;\phi \in \operatorname{Gal}(L/\mathbf Q)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Frobenius automorphism]] associated to β; the characteristic property of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is that
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x) \equiv x^q\!\!\! \pmod{\beta}\ \text{ for any } x\in \mathcal O_L.  &lt;/math&gt;
(The existence of such a Frobenius element depends on quite a bit of algebraic number theory machinery.)

The key fact about &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; that we need is that for any subfield ''K'' of ''L'',
:&lt;math&gt;\phi\,\mbox{ fixes } K \quad \iff \quad q\,\mbox{ splits completely in } K.&lt;/math&gt;
Indeed, let δ be any ideal of ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; below β (and hence above ''q''). Then, since &lt;math&gt;\phi(x) \equiv x^q \pmod{\delta} &lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x\in \mathcal O_K&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;\phi\vert_K \in \operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbf Q)&lt;/math&gt; is a Frobenius for δ. A standard result concerning &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is that its order is equal to the corresponding inertial degree; that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ord}(\phi\vert_K) = [O_K/\delta O_K : \mathbf Z/q\mathbf Z].&lt;/math&gt;
The left hand side is equal to 1 if and only if φ fixes ''K'', and the right hand side is equal to one if and only ''q'' splits completely in ''K'', so we are done.

Now, since the ''p''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; roots of unity are distinct modulo β (i.e. the polynomial ''X''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 is separable in characteristic ''q''), we must have
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\zeta_p) = \zeta_p^q;&lt;/math&gt;
that is, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the automorphism σ&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; defined earlier. Taking ''K'' to be the quadratic field in which we are interested, we obtain the equivalence
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac qp\right) =1 \quad \iff \quad q\,\mbox{ splits completely in } \mathbf Q(\sqrt{p^*}).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Completing the proof ===

Finally we must show that
:&lt;math&gt;q\,\mbox{ splits completely in } \mathbf Q(\sqrt{p^*}) \quad \iff \quad \left(\frac{p^*}q\right) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
Once we have done this, the law of quadratic reciprocity falls out immediately since
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p^*}q\right) = \left(\frac qp\right)\ \text{ for } p\equiv 1\!\!\! \pmod 4, &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p^*}q\right) = \left(\frac{-p}q\right) = \left(\frac{-1}q\right)\left(\frac pq\right) 
= \begin{cases} +\left(\frac pq \right) &amp; \mbox{if } q \equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\ -\left(\frac pq\right) &amp; \mbox{if } q \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;p\equiv 3\!\!\! \pmod 4&lt;/math&gt;.

To show the last equivalence, suppose first that &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p^*}q\right) = 1.&lt;/math&gt; In this case, there is some integer ''x'' (not divisible by ''q'') such that &lt;math&gt; x^2 \equiv p^* \pmod{q}, &lt;/math&gt; say &lt;math&gt; x^2 - p^* = cq &lt;/math&gt; for some integer ''c''. Let
&lt;math&gt;K = \mathbf Q(\sqrt{p^*}),&lt;/math&gt; and consider the ideal &lt;math&gt;(x-\sqrt{p^*},q)&lt;/math&gt; of ''K''. It certainly divides the principal ideal (''q''). It cannot be equal to (''q''), since &lt;math&gt;x-\sqrt{p^*}&lt;/math&gt; is not divisible by ''q''. It cannot be the unit ideal, because then
:&lt;math&gt;(x+\sqrt{p^*}) = (x+\sqrt{p^*})(x-\sqrt{p^*},q) = (cq, q(x+\sqrt{p^*}))&lt;/math&gt;
is divisible by ''q'', which is again impossible. Therefore (''q'') must split in ''K''.

Conversely, suppose that (''q'') splits, and let β be a prime of ''K'' above ''q''. Then &lt;math&gt;(q) \subsetneq \beta,&lt;/math&gt; so we may choose some
:&lt;math&gt;a+b\sqrt{p^*} \in \beta\setminus(q), \text{ where } a,b\in \mathbb Q. &lt;/math&gt;
Actually, since &lt;math&gt;p^* \equiv 1\!\!\! \pmod{4},&lt;/math&gt; elementary theory of quadratic fields implies that the ring of integers of ''K'' is precisely &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{p^*}}2\right],&lt;/math&gt; so the denominators of ''a'' and ''b'' are at worst equal to 2. Since ''q'' ≠ 2, we may safely multiply ''a'' and ''b'' by 2, and assume that &lt;math&gt;a+b\sqrt{p^*} \in \beta\setminus(q),&lt;/math&gt; where now ''a'' and ''b'' are in '''Z'''. In this case we have
:&lt;math&gt;(a+b\sqrt{p^*})(a-b\sqrt{p^*}) = a^2 - b^2p^* \in \beta \cap \mathbf Z = (q),&lt;/math&gt;
so  &lt;math&gt;q \mid a^2 - b^2p^*.&lt;/math&gt; However, ''q'' cannot divide ''b'', since then also ''q'' divides ''a'', which contradicts our choice of &lt;math&gt;a+b\sqrt{p^*}.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, we may divide by ''b'' modulo ''q'', to obtain &lt;math&gt;p^* \equiv (ab^{-1})^2\!\!\! \pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt; as desired.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2217">In [[mathematics]], a '''pseudo-monotone operator''' from a [[reflexive space|reflexive]] [[Banach space]] into its [[continuous dual space]] is one that is, in some sense, almost as [[well-behaved]] as a [[monotone operator]]. Many problems in the [[calculus of variations]] can be expressed using operators that are pseudo-monotone, and pseudo-monotonicity in turn implies the existence of solutions to these problems.

==Definition==

Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||) be a reflexive Banach space. A map ''T''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; from ''X'' into its continuous dual space ''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is said to be '''pseudo-monotone''' if ''T'' is a [[bounded operator]] (not necessarily continuous) and if whenever

:&lt;math&gt;u_{j} \rightharpoonup u \mbox{ in } X \mbox{ as } j \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;

(i.e. ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; [[weak topology|converges weakly]] to ''u'') and

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{j \to \infty} \langle T(u_{j}), u_{j} - u \rangle \leq 0,&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that, for all ''v''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'',

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{j \to \infty} \langle T(u_{j}), u_{j} - v \rangle \geq \langle T(u), u - v \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties of pseudo-monotone operators==

Using a very similar proof to that of the [[Browder-Minty theorem]], one can show the following:

Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||) be a [[real number|real]], reflexive Banach space and suppose that ''T''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is [[bounded function|bounded]], [[coercive function|coercive]] and pseudo-monotone. Then, for each [[continuous linear functional]] ''g''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, there exists a solution ''u''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'' of the equation ''T''(''u'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''g''.

'''Redfield ratio''' or '''Redfield stoichiometry''' is the atomic ratio of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] found in [[phytoplankton]] and throughout the deep oceans. This [[empirically]] developed [[stoichiometric]] ratio was originally found to be C:N:P = 106:16:1. This term is named after the American [[oceanographer]] [[Alfred C. Redfield]], who first described this ratio in an article written in 1934 (Redfield 1934).  As a Harvard [[physiologist]], Redfield participated in several voyages on board the research vessel [[RV Atlantis|Atlantis]]. Alfred Redfield analyzed thousands of samples of marine [[biomass]] across all of the ocean regions. From this research he found that globally the elemental composition of marine organic matter (dead and living) was remarkably constant across all of the regions. The stoichiometric ratios of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus remain relatively consistent from both the coastal to open ocean regions.

==History==
For his 1934 paper, Alfred Redfield analyzed nitrate and phosphate data for Atlantic, Indian, Pacific oceans and Barents Sea, including data published by other researchers. In addition, Redfield analyzed data for C, N, and P content in marine plankton, including data collected by other researchers as early as 1898.

Redfield’s analysis of the empirical data led to him to a startling discovery: across and within the three oceans and Barents Sea, seawater had the N:P atomic ratio near 20:1 (later corrected to 16:1), and was very similar to the average N:P in plankton. Redfield seemed to be deeply puzzled that “the definite correlation exists between the quantity of nitrate and phosphate occurring in any sample” and thought that “it is pertinent to inquire how these proportions agree with those actually found in various members of the plankton community.” (Redfield 1934)

Redfield foresaw that “relation between the concentration of the various organic derivatives in sea water and the chemical composition of plankton would provide a valuable tool in the analysis of many oceanographic problems.” (Redfield 1934)

Understanding that the problem is akin to the classical [[Chicken or the egg|the chicken or the egg causality dilemma]], Redfield proposed two mutually non-exclusive mechanisms:

I) The N:P in plankton tends to the N:P composition of seawater. Specifically, phytoplankton species with different N and P requirements compete and, as the result, balance each other so that “the ratio of the elements in the plankton as a whole might come to reflect the ratio of the nutrient substances in sea water rather closely” (Redfield 1934).

II) The N:P in seawater “must tend to approach that characteristic of protoplasm in general”  (Redfield 1934). Furthermore, Redfield proposed thermostat like scenario in which the activities of nitrogen fixers and denitrifiers keep the nitrate to phosphate ratio in the seawater near the requirements in the protoplasm. Considering that at the time little was known about the composition of “protoplasm,” Redfield did not attempt to explain why its N:P ratio should be approximately 16:1.

In 1958, almost a quarter century after first discovering the ratios, Redfield leaned toward the latter mechanism proposing in his seminal manuscript the idea of "the biological control of chemical factors" in the ocean (Redfield, 1958). Redfield proposed that the ratio of Nitrogen to Phosphorus in plankton resulted in the global ocean having a remarkably similar ratio of dissolved [[nitrate]] to [[phosphate]] (16:1). He considered how the cycles of not just N and P but also C and O could interact to result in this match.

==Uses==

The research that resulted in this ratio has become a fundamental feature in the understanding of the biogeochemical cycles of the oceans, and one of the key tenets of biogeochemistry. The Redfield ratio is instrumental in estimating carbon and nutrient fluxes in [[Global climate model|global circulation models]]. They also help in determining which nutrients are limiting in a localized system, if there is a limiting nutrient.  The ratio can also be used to understand the formation of phytoplankton blooms and subsequently hypoxia by comparing the ratio between different regions, such as a comparison of the Redfield Ratio of the Mississippi River to the ratio of the northern Gulf of Mexico.

== Explanation ==

Redfield discovered the remarkable congruence between the chemistry of the deep ocean and the chemistry of living things such as phytoplankton in the surface ocean. Both have N:P ratios of about 16:1 in terms of atoms.  When nutrients are not [[limiting]], the [[Molar concentration|molar]] elemental ratio C:N:P in most phytoplankton is 106:16:1. Redfield thought it wasn't purely coincidental that the vast oceans would have a chemistry perfectly suited to the requirements of living organisms.

In the ocean a large portion of the biomass is found to be nitrogen-rich plankton.  Many of these plankton are consumed by other plankton biomass which have similar chemical compositions. This results in a similar nitrogen to phosphorus ratio, on average, for all the plankton throughout the world’s ocean, empirically found to be averaging approximately 16:1.  When these organisms sink into the ocean interior, their energy-rich bodies are consumed by bacteria that, in [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] conditions, [[oxidize]] the organic matter to form dissolved inorganic nutrients, mainly [[carbon dioxide]], nitrate, and phosphate.

That the nitrate to phosphate ratio in the interior of all of the major ocean basins is highly similar is possibly due to the residence times of these elements in the ocean relative to the oceans circulation time, roughly 100 000 years for phosphorus and 2000 years for nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;http://lgmacweb.env.uea.ac.uk/green_ocean/positions/diazotroph.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the residence times of these elements are greater than the mixing times of the oceans (~ 1000 years)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbari.org/chemsensor/distribution.html&lt;/ref&gt; can result in the ratio of nitrate to phosphate in the ocean interior remaining fairly constant.

While such arguments can potentially explain why the ratios are fairly constant, they do not address the question why the N:P ratio is nearly 16 and not some other number.

==Deviations from the canonical Redfield Ratio==

The Redfield ratio was initially derived empirically from measurements of the elemental composition of plankton in addition to the nitrate and phosphate content of seawater collected from a few stations in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. This was later supported by hundreds of independent measurements. However, looking at the composition of individual [[species]] of phytoplankton grown under nitrogen or phosphorus limitation shows that this nitrogen to phosphorus ratio can vary anywhere from 6:1 to 60:1.  While understanding this problem, Redfield never attempted to explain it with the exception of noting that the N:P ratio of inorganic nutrients in the ocean interior was an average with small scale variability to be expected.

Although the Redfield ratio is remarkably stable in the deep ocean, phytoplankton may have large variations in the C:N:P composition, and their life strategy play a role in the C:N:P ratio, which has made some researchers speculate that the Redfield ratio perhaps is a general average rather than specific requirement for phytoplankton growth (e.g., Arrigo 2005). However, the Redfield ratio was recently found to be related to a homeostatic protein-to-[[rRNA]] ratio fundamentally present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Loladze and Elser 2011). Furthermore, the Redfield ratio has been shown to vary at different spatial scales as well as average slightly higher (166:20:1) than Redfield's original estimate (Sterner et al. 2008).

Despite reports that the elemental composition of [[organisms]] such as marine phytoplankton in an oceanic region do not conform to the canonical Redfield ratio, the fundamental concept of this ratio continues to remain valid and useful.

==Extended Redfield ratio==

Some feel that there are other elements, such as [[potassium]], [[sulfur]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], and [[iron]] are also important in the ocean chemistry. In particular, iron (Fe) was considered of great importance as early [[Biological Oceanography|biological oceanographers]] hypothesized that iron may also be a limiting factor for [[primary production]] in the ocean.  As a result an extended Redfield ratio was developed to include this as part of this balance.  This new stoichiometric ratio states that the ratio should be 106 C:16 N:1 P:0.1-0.001 Fe.  The variation in iron is the result of “…iron contamination on ships and in labs is large and difficult to control.  No one has been able to beat this nearly insuperable combination of difficulties.”  (Broecker and Peng (1982)).  It is this [[contamination]] that resulted in early evidence suggesting that iron concentrations were high and not a limiting factor in marine primary production.

==Redfield Ratio in Diatoms==

[[Diatoms]] need, among other nutrients, [[silicic acid]] to create [[biogenic silica]] for their [[frustules]] (cell walls).  As a result of this the Redfield-Brzezinski nutrient ratio was proposed for diatoms and stated to be C:Si:N:P = 106:15:16:1 (Brzezinski, 1985).

Concentrations and ratios of particulate organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the global ocean. Scientific Data, 1., http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201448&lt;/ref&gt; which aggregated Redfield ratios measurements from observational cruises around the world from 1970 to 2010. This article gave a large database usable to study the evolution of particular phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen across sea stations and time.

==Percolation theory==
{{Main article|Percolation theory}}

The focus of robustness in complex networks is the response of the network to the [[Node deletion|removal of nodes]] or links. The mathematical model of such a process can be thought of as an inverse percolation process. [[Percolation theory]] models the process of randomly placing pebbles on an n-dimensional lattice with probability p, and predicts the sudden formation of a single large cluster at a critical probability &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Stauffer1994"&gt;D. Stauffer and A. Aharony. Introduction to Percolation Theory. Tay-lor and Francis. London, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In percolation theory this cluster is named the percolating cluster. This phenomenon is quantified in percolation theory by a number of quantities, for example the average cluster size &lt;math&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;/math&gt;. This quantity represents the average size of all finite clusters and is given by the following equation.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&lt;s&gt;\sim \left|p - p_c\right|^{\gamma_p}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

We can see the average cluster size suddenly diverges around the critical probability, indicating the formation of a single large cluster. It is also important to note that the exponent &lt;math&gt;\gamma_p&lt;/math&gt; is universal for all lattices, while &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; is not. This is important as it indicates a universal [[phase transition]] behavior, at a point dependent on the topology. The problem of robustness in complex networks can be seen as starting with the percolating cluster, and removing a critical fraction of the pebbles for the cluster to break down. Analogous to the formation of the percolation cluster in percolation theory, the breaking down of a complex network happens abruptly during a phase transition at some critical fraction of nodes removed.

==Critical threshold for random failures==

The mathematical derivation for the threshold at which a complex network will lose its [[giant component]] is based on the [[Molloy–Reed criterion]].&lt;ref name="Molloy1995"&gt;Molloy, M. and Reed, B. (1995) ''Random Structures and Algorithms 6'', 161–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\kappa \equiv \frac{&lt;k^2&gt;}{&lt;k&gt;} &gt; 2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Molloy–Reed criterion is derived from the basic principle that in order for a giant component to exist, on average each node in the network must have at least two links. This is analogous to each person holding two others' hands in order to form a chain. Using this criterion and an involved mathematical proof, one can derive a critical threshold for the fraction of nodes needed to be removed for the breakdown of the giant component of a complex network.&lt;ref name="Cohen2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=R. |last2=Erez |first2=K. |last3=Havlin |first3=S. |title=Resilience of the Internet to random breakdowns |url=|journal=Phys.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_c=1-\frac{1}{\frac{&lt;k^2&gt;}{&lt;k&gt;}-1}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

An important property of this finding is that the critical threshold is only dependent on the first and second moment of the [[degree distribution]] and is valid for an arbitrary degree distribution.

===Random network===
{{Main article|Erdős–Rényi model}}

Using &lt;math&gt;&lt;k^2&gt;=&lt;k&gt;(&lt;k&gt;+1)&lt;/math&gt; for an [[Erdős–Rényi model|Erdős–Rényi (ER) random graph]], one can re-express the critical point for a random network.&lt;ref name="NetworkBook"&gt;ALBERT-LÁSZLÓ BARABÁSI. Network Science (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_c^{ER}=1-\frac{1}{&lt;k&gt;}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

As a random network gets denser, the critical threshold increases, meaning a higher fraction of the nodes must be removed to disconnect the giant component.

===Scale-free network===
{{Main article|Scale-free network}}

By re-expressing the critical threshold as a function of the gamma exponent for a [[scale-free network]], we can draw a couple of important conclusions regarding scale-free network robustness.&lt;ref name="NetworkBook"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_c &amp;=1-\frac{1}{\kappa-1}\\
\kappa &amp;=\frac{&lt;k^2&gt;}{&lt;k&gt;}=\left|\frac{2-\gamma}{3-\gamma}\right|A \\
A &amp;=K_{min},~\gamma &gt; 3 \\
A &amp;=K_{max}^{3-\gamma}K_{min}^{\gamma-2},~3 &gt; \gamma &gt; 2 \\
A &amp;=K_{max},~2 &gt; \gamma &gt; 1 \\
&amp;where~K_{max}=K_{min}N^{\frac{1}{\gamma - 1}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For gamma greater than 3, the critical threshold only depends on gamma and the minimum degree, and in this regime the network acts like a random network breaking when a finite fraction of its nodes are removed. For gamma less than 3, &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; diverges in the limit as N trends toward infinity. In this case, for large scale-free networks, the critical threshold approaches 1. This essentially means almost all nodes must be removed in order to destroy the giant component, and large scale-free networks are very robust with regard to random failures. One can make intuitive sense of this conclusion by thinking about the heterogeneity of scale-free networks and of the hubs in particular. Because there are relatively few hubs, they are less likely to be removed through random failures while small low-degree nodes are more likely to be removed. Because the low-degree nodes are of little importance in connecting the giant component, their removal has little impact.

==Targeted attacks on scale-free networks==

Although scale-free networks are resilient to random failures, we might imagine them being quite vulnerable to targeted hub removal. In this case we consider the robustness of scale free networks in response to targeted attacks, performed with thorough prior knowledge of the network topology. By considering the changes induced by the removal of a hub, specifically the change in the maximum degree and the degrees of the connected nodes, we can derive another formula for the critical threshold considering targeted attacks on a scale free network.&lt;ref name="Cohen2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=R. |last2=Erez |first2=K. |last3=ben-Avraham |first3=D. |last4=Havlin |first4=S. |title=Breakdown of the Internet under intentional attack |url=|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=86 |page=3682|year=2001 |doi=10.1103/physrevlett.86.3682 |bibcode=2001PhRvL..86.3682C|arxiv=cond-mat/0010251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_c^{\frac{2-\gamma}{1-\gamma}}=2+\frac{2-\gamma}{3-\gamma}K_{min}(f_c^{\frac{3-\gamma}{1-\gamma}}-1)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation cannot be solved analytically, but can be graphed numerically. To summarize the important points, when gamma is large, the network acts as a random network, and attack robustness become similar to random failure robustness of a random network. However, when gamma is smaller, the critical threshold for attacks on scale-free networks becomes relatively small, indicating a weakness to targeted attacks.

==Cascading failures==
{{Main article|Cascading failure}}

An important aspect of failures in many networks is that a single failure in one node might induce failures in neighboring nodes. When a small number of failures induces more failures, resulting in a large number of failures relative to the network size, a [[cascading failure]] has occurred. There are many models for cascading failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobson |first1=I. |last2=Carreras |first2=B. A. |last3=Lynch |first3=V. E. |last4=Newman |first4=D.

Each model focuses on some sort of propagation or cascade, there is some threshold determining when a node will fail or activate and contribute towards propagation, and there is some mechanism defined by which propagation will be directed when nodes fail or activate. All of these models predict some critical state, in which the distribution of the size of potential cascades matches a power law, and the exponent is uniquely determined by the degree exponent of the underlying network. Because of the differences in the models and the consensus of this result, we{{Who|date=April 2015}} are led to believe the underlying phenomenon is universal and model-independent.&lt;ref name="NetworkBook"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], specifically [[transcendental number theory]], '''Schanuel's conjecture''' is a conjecture made by  [[Stephen Schanuel]] in the 1960s concerning the [[transcendence degree]] of certain [[field extension]]s of the [[rational numbers]].

==Statement==

The conjecture is as follows:
:Given any {{math| ''n'' }} [[complex number]]s {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} that are [[linear independence|linearly independent]] over the [[rational number]]s {{math|&amp;#x211A;}}, the [[field extension]] {{math|&amp;#x211A;(''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}}) has [[transcendence degree]] at least {{math|''n''}} over {{math|&amp;#x211A;}}.

The conjecture can be found in Lang (1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Serge Lang |first=Serge |last=Lang |title=Introduction to Transcendental Numbers |location= |publisher=Addison–Wesley |year=1966 |pages=30–31 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

The conjecture, if proven, would generalize most known results in [[transcendental number theory]].  The special case where the numbers ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are all [[algebraic number|algebraic]] is the [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]].  If, on the other hand, the numbers are chosen so as to make exp(''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),...,exp(''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) all algebraic then one would prove that linearly independent logarithms of algebraic numbers are algebraically independent, a strengthening of [[Baker's theorem]].

The [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]] follows from this strengthened version of Baker's theorem, as does the currently unproven [[four exponentials conjecture]].

Schanuel's conjecture, if proved, would also settle whether numbers such as ''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;π and ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''e''&lt;/sup&gt; are algebraic or transcendental, and prove that ''e'' and π are algebraically independent simply by setting ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;π''i'', and using [[Euler's identity]].

Euler's identity states that ''e''&lt;sup&gt;π''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  If Schanuel's conjecture is true then this is, in some precise sense involving [[exponential ring]]s, the ''only'' relation between ''e'', π, and ''i'' over the complex numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Giuseppina |last=Terzo |title=Some consequences of Schanuel's conjecture in exponential rings |journal=Communications in Algebra |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=1171–1189 |doi=10.1080/00927870701410694 |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ostensibly a problem in number theory, the conjecture has implications in [[model theory]] as well.  [[Angus Macintyre]] and [[Alex Wilkie]], for example, proved that the theory of the real field with exponentiation, {{math|&amp;#x211D;}}&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;, is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] provided Schanuel's conjecture is true.&lt;ref name="MW96"&gt;{{Cite book |first=A. |last=Macintyre |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=A. J. |last2=Wilkie |chapter=On the decidability of the real exponential field |editor-first=Piergiorgio |editor-last=Odifreddi |title=Kreiseliana: About and Around Georg Kreisel |year=1996 |location=Wellesley |publisher=Peters |pages=441–467 |isbn=1-56881-061-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact they only needed the real version of the conjecture, defined below, to prove this result, which would be a positive solution to [[Tarski's exponential function problem]].

==Related conjectures and results==

The '''converse Schanuel conjecture'''&lt;ref&gt;Scott W. Williams, [http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/0papers/million.buck.problems.mi.pdf Million Bucks Problems]&lt;/ref&gt; is the following statement: 
:Suppose ''F'' is a [[countable]] [[field (mathematics)|field]] with [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0, and ''e'' : ''F'' &amp;rarr; ''F'' is a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] from the additive group (''F'',+) to the multiplicative group (''F'',&amp;middot;) whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is [[cyclic group|cyclic]]. Suppose further that for any ''n'' elements ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''F'' which are linearly independent over {{math|&amp;#x211A;}}, the extension field {{math|&amp;#x211A;}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''e''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),...,''e''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) has transcendence degree at least ''n'' over {{math|&amp;#x211A;}}. Then there exists a field homomorphism ''h'' : ''F'' &amp;rarr; {{math|&amp;#x2102;}} such that ''h''(''e''(''x''))=exp(''h''(''x'')) for all ''x'' in ''F''.

A version of Schanuel's conjecture for [[formal power series]], also by Schanuel, was proven by [[James Ax]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=James |last=Ax |title=On Schanuel's conjectures |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |issue=2 |volume=93 |year=1971 |pages=252–268 |jstor=1970774|doi=
10.2307/1970774 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It states:
:Given any ''n'' formal power series ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''t''{{math|&amp;#x2102;}}&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''t''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; which are linearly independent over {{math|&amp;#x211A;}}, then the field extension {{math|&amp;#x2102;}}(''t'',''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,exp(''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),...,exp(''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) has transcendence degree at least ''n'' over {{math|&amp;#x2102;}}(''t'').

As stated above, the decidability of {{math|&amp;#x211D;}}&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; follows from the real version of Schanuel's conjecture which is as follows:&lt;ref name="KZ06"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Jonathan |last=Kirby |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Boris |last2=Zilber |title=The uniform Schanuel conjecture over the real numbers |journal=Bull. London Math. Soc. |volume=38 |year=2006 |issue= |pages=568–570 |doi=10.1112/S0024609306018510}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Suppose ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[real number]]s and the transcendence degree of the field {{math|&amp;#x211A;}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, [[exponential function|exp]](''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),...,exp(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) is strictly less than ''n'', then there are integers ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, not all zero, such that ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+...+&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
A related conjecture called the uniform real Schanuel's conjecture essentially says the same but puts a bound on the integers ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The uniform real version of the conjecture is equivalent to the standard real version.&lt;ref name="KZ06"/&gt;  Macintyre and Wilkie showed that a consequence of Schanuel's conjecture, which they dubbed the Weak Schanuel's conjecture, was equivalent to the decidability of {{math|&amp;#x211D;}}&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;.  This conjecture states that there is a computable upper bound on the norm of non-singular solutions to systems of [[exponential polynomial]]s; this is, non-obviously, a consequence of Schanuel's conjecture for the reals.&lt;ref name="MW96"/&gt;

It is also known that Schanuel's conjecture would be a consequence of conjectural results in the theory of [[motive (algebraic geometry)|motives]]. There [[Grothendieck's period conjecture]] for an [[abelian variety]] ''A'' states that the transcendence degree of its [[period matrix]] is the same as the dimension of the associated [[Mumford–Tate group]], and what is known by work of [[Pierre Deligne]] is that the dimension is an upper bound for the transcendence degree. Bertolin has shown how a generalised period conjecture includes Schanuel's conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Cristiana |last=Bertolin |title=Périodes de 1-motifs et transcendance |journal=Journal of Number Theory |volume=97 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=204–221 |doi=10.1016/S0022-314X(02)00002-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zilber's pseudo-exponentiation==

While a proof of Schanuel's conjecture with number theoretic tools seems a long way off,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Michel |last=Waldschmidt |title=Diophantine approximation on linear algebraic groups |location=Berlin |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |year=2000 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; connections with model theory have prompted a surge of research on the conjecture.

In 2004, [[Boris Zilber]] systematically constructed [[exponential field]]s ''K''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; that are algebraically closed and of characteristic zero, and such that one of these fields exists for each [[uncountable]] [[cardinality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Boris |last=Zilber |title=Pseudo-exponentiation on algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero |journal=[[Annals of Pure and Applied Logic]] |volume=132 |year=2004 |issue=1 |pages=67–95 |doi=10.1016/j.apal.2004.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He axiomatised these fields and, using [[Hrushovski construction|Hrushovski's construction]] and techniques inspired by work of [[Saharon Shelah | Shelah]] on [[categoricity]] in [[infinitary logic]]s, proved that this theory of "pseudo-exponentiation" has a unique model in each uncountable cardinal.  Schanuel's conjecture is part of this axiomatisation, and so the natural conjecture that the unique model of cardinality continuum is actually isomorphic to the complex exponential field implies Schanuel's conjecture. In fact, Zilber showed that this conjecture holds if and only if both Schanuel's conjecture and another unproven condition on the complex exponentiation field, which Zilber calls exponential-algebraic closedness, hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Boris |last=Zilber |title=Exponential sums equations and the Schanuel conjecture |journal=J. London Math. Soc. |issue=2 |volume=65 |year=2002 |pages=27–44 |doi= 10.1112/S0024610701002861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3672">In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''Schur test''', named after German mathematician [[Issai Schur]], is a bound on the &lt;math&gt;L^2\to L^2&lt;/math&gt; [[operator norm]] of an [[integral operator]] in terms of its [[Schwartz kernel]] (see [[Schwartz kernel theorem]]).

Here is one version.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Richard Halmos]] and Viakalathur Shankar Sunder, ''Bounded integral operators on &lt;math&gt;L^{2}&lt;/math&gt; spaces'', Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete (Results in Mathematics and Related Areas), vol. 96., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1978. Theorem 5.2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Let &lt;math&gt;X,\,Y&lt;/math&gt; be two [[measurable space]]s  (such as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;). Let &lt;math&gt;\,T&lt;/math&gt; be an [[integral operator]] with the non-negative Schwartz kernel &lt;math&gt;\,K(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;T f(x)=\int_Y K(x,y)f(y)\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;

If there exist real functions &lt;math&gt;\,p(x)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,q(y)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and numbers &lt;math&gt;\,\alpha,\beta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt; (1)\qquad \int_Y K(x,y)q(y)\,dy\le\alpha p(x) &lt;/math&gt;

for [[almost everywhere|almost all]] &lt;math&gt;\,x&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt; (2)\qquad \int_X p(x)K(x,y)\,dx\le\beta q(y)&lt;/math&gt;

for almost all &lt;math&gt;\,y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\,T&lt;/math&gt; extends to a [[continuous operator]] &lt;math&gt;T:L^2\to L^2&lt;/math&gt; with the [[operator norm]]

:&lt;math&gt; \Vert T\Vert_{L^2\to L^2} \le\sqrt{\alpha\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Such functions &lt;math&gt;\,p(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\,q(y)&lt;/math&gt; are called the Schur test functions.

In the original version, &lt;math&gt;\,T&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix and &lt;math&gt;\,\alpha=\beta=1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[I. Schur]], ''Bemerkungen zur Theorie der Beschränkten Bilinearformen mit unendlich vielen Veränderlichen'', J. reine angew. Math. 140 (1911), 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common usage and Young's inequality==

A common usage of the Schur test is to take &lt;math&gt;\,p(x)=q(y)=1.&lt;/math&gt; Then we get:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Vert T\Vert^2_{L^2\to L^2}\le
\sup_{x\in X}\int_Y|K(x,y)| \, dy
\cdot
\sup_{y\in Y}\int_X|K(x,y)| \, dx.
&lt;/math&gt;

This inequality is valid no matter whether the Schwartz kernel &lt;math&gt;\,K(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is non-negative or not.

A similar statement about &lt;math&gt;L^p\to L^q&lt;/math&gt; operator norms is known as [[Young's inequality for integral operators]]:&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 0.3.1 in: [[Christopher D. Sogge|C. D. Sogge]], ''Fourier integral operators in classical analysis'', Cambridge University Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-521-43464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

if

:&lt;math&gt;\sup_x\Big(\int_Y|K(x,y)|^r\,dy\Big)^{1/r} + \sup_y\Big(\int_X|K(x,y)|^r\,dx\Big)^{1/r}\le C,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 r=1-\Big(\frac 1 p-\frac 1 q\Big)&lt;/math&gt;, for some &lt;math&gt;1\le p\le q\le\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then the operator &lt;math&gt;Tf(x)=\int_Y K(x,y)f(y)\,dy&lt;/math&gt; extends to a continuous operator &lt;math&gt;T:L^p(Y)\to L^q(X)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\Vert T\Vert_{L^p\to L^q}\le C.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==

Using the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] and the inequality (1), we get:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} |Tf(x)|^2=\left|\int_Y K(x,y)f(y)\,dy\right|^2
&amp;\le \left(\int_Y K(x,y)q(y)\,dy\right) 
\left(\int_Y \frac{K(x,y)f(y)^2}{q(y)} dy\right)\\
&amp;\le\alpha p(x)\int_Y \frac{K(x,y)f(y)^2}{q(y)} \, dy.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating the above relation in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, using [[Fubini's Theorem]], and applying the inequality (2), we get:

:&lt;math&gt; \Vert T f\Vert_{L^2}^2 
\le \alpha \int_Y \left(\int_X p(x)K(x,y)\,dx\right) \frac{f(y)^2}{q(y)} \, dy
\le\alpha\beta \int_Y f(y)^2 dy =\alpha\beta\Vert f\Vert_{L^2}^2. &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that &lt;math&gt;\Vert T f\Vert_{L^2}\le\sqrt{\alpha\beta}\Vert f\Vert_{L^2}&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;f\in L^2(Y)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8892">'''Sicherman dice''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|k|ər|m|ən}} are the only pair of 6-sided [[dice]] that are not [[normal dice]], bear only [[positive integers]], and have the same [[probability distribution]] for the [[summation|sum]] as normal dice.

The faces on the dice are numbered 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4 and 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.

==Mathematics==
A standard exercise in elementary combinatorics is to calculate the number of ways of rolling any given value with a pair of fair six-sided [[dice]] (by taking the [[summation|sum]] of the two rolls). The table shows the number of such ways of rolling a given value &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;:

'''Crazy dice''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] exercise in elementary [[combinatorics]], involving a re-labeling of the faces of a pair of six-sided dice to reproduce the same frequency of [[sums]] as the standard labeling. The Sicherman dice are crazy dice that are re-labeled with only [[positive integer]]s. 

The table below lists all possible totals of dice rolls with standard dice and Sicherman dice. One Sicherman die is coloured  for clarity: '''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;''2''&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;''3''&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;''', and the other is all black, 1–3–4–5–6–8.

==History==
The Sicherman dice were discovered by George Sicherman of [[Buffalo, New York]] and were originally reported by [[Martin Gardner]] in a 1978 article in ''[[Scientific American]]''.

The numbers can be arranged so that all pairs of numbers on opposing sides sum to equal numbers, 5 for the first and 9 for the second.

Later, in a letter to Sicherman, Gardner mentioned that a magician he knew had anticipated Sicherman's discovery. For generalizations of the Sicherman dice to more than two dice and noncubical dice, see Broline (1979), Gallian and Rusin (1979), Brunson and Swift (1997/1998), and Fowler and Swift (1999).

==Mathematical justification==
Let a ''canonical'' ''n''-sided die be an [[polyhedron|''n''-hedron]] whose faces are marked with the integers [1,n] such that the probability of throwing each number is 1/''n''. Consider the canonical cubical (six-sided) die. The [[generating function]] for the throws of such a die is &lt;math&gt;x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6&lt;/math&gt;. The product of this polynomial with itself yields the generating function for the throws of a pair of dice: &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 2 x^3 + 3 x^4 + 4 x^5 + 5 x^6 + 6 x^7 + 5 x^8 + 4 x^9 + 3 x^{10} + 2 x^{11} +x^{12}&lt;/math&gt;. From the theory of [[Root of unity#Cyclotomic polynomials|cyclotomic polynomials]], we know that
:&lt;math&gt;x^n - 1 = \prod_{d\,\mid\,n}^n \Phi_d(x).&lt;/math&gt;
where ''d'' ranges over the [[divisor]]s of ''n'' and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_d(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''d''-th cyclotomic polynomial. We note also that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^n -1}{x-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x^i = 1 + x + \cdots + x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
We therefore derive the generating function of a single ''n''-sided canonical die as being
:&lt;math&gt;x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n = \frac{x}{x-1} \prod_{d\,\mid\,n}^n \Phi_d(x)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Phi_1(x) = x - 1&lt;/math&gt; and is canceled. Thus the [[factorization]] of the generating function of a six-sided canonical die is
:&lt;math&gt;x\,\Phi_2(x)\,\Phi_3(x)\,\Phi_6(x) = x\;(x+1)\;(x^2 + x + 1)\;(x^2 - x +1)&lt;/math&gt;
The generating function for the throws of two dice is the product of two copies of each of these factors. How can we partition them to form two legal dice whose spots are not arranged traditionally? Here ''legal'' means that the coefficients are non-negative and sum to six, so that each die has six sides and every face has at least one spot.  (That is, the generating function of each die must be a polynomial p(x) with positive coefficients, and with p(0) = 0 and p(1) = 6.)  
Only one such partition exists:
:&lt;math&gt;x\;(x + 1)\;(x^2 + x + 1) = x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;x\;(x + 1)\;(x^2 + x + 1)\;(x^2 - x + 1)^2 = x + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^8&lt;/math&gt;
This gives us the distribution of spots on the faces of a pair of Sicherman dice as being {1,2,2,3,3,4} and {1,3,4,5,6,8}, as above.

This technique can be extended for dice with an arbitrary number of sides.

{{about||people with the surname Southward (redirects here)|Southward (surname)}}
[[File:Compass Rose English South.svg|thumb|250px|right|A 16-point [[compass rose]] with south at the bottom.]]
'''South''' is one of the four [[cardinal direction]]s or [[compass points]]. South is the opposite of [[north]] and is [[perpendicular]] to the [[east]] and [[west]].

==Etymology==
The word ''south'' comes from [[Old English]] ''sūþ'', from earlier [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*sunþaz'' ("south"), possibly related to the same [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root that the word ''sun'' derived from.

==Navigation==
By [[Norm (sociology)|convention]], the bottom side of a [[map]] is south, although [[reversed map]]s exist that defy this convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flourish.org/upsidedownmap/ |title=The Upsidedown Map Page |publisher=flourish.org |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To go south using a compass for [[navigation]], set a [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] or [[azimuth]] of 180°. Alternatively, in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] outside the [[tropics]], the [[Sun]] will be roughly in the south at [[midday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learn-orienteering.org/old/lesson1.html |title=How to use a compass |publisher=Learn Orienteering |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Pole==
True south is the direction towards the sun end of the axis about which the [[Earth]] rotates, called the [[South Pole]]. The South Pole is located in [[Antarctica]]. [[South Magnetic Pole|Magnetic south]] is the direction towards the south [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic pole]], some distance away from the south geographic pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml |title=Geomagnetism Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roald Amundsen]], from [[Norway]], was the first to [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|reach the South Pole]], on 14 December 1911, after [[Ernest Shackleton]] from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] was forced to turn back some distance short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/ice/peopleevents/pandeAMEX87.html |title=Roald Amundsen |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The [[North–South divide|Global South]] refers to the socially and economically less-developed southern half of the globe. 95% of the Global North has enough food and shelter, and a functioning education system.&lt;ref name=mimko/&gt; In the South, on the other hand, only 5% of the population has enough food and shelter. It "lacks appropriate technology, it has no political stability, the economies are disarticulated, and their foreign exchange earnings depend on primary product exports".&lt;ref name=mimko&gt;{{cite book |last=Mimiko |first=Oluwafemi |title=Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business |year=2012 |publisher=Carolina Academic |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the term "South" may also be country-relative, particularly in cases of noticeable economic or cultural divide. For example, the [[Southern United States]], separated from the [[Northeastern United States]] by the [[Mason–Dixon line]], or the [[Southern England|South of England]], which is politically and economically unmatched with all of the [[Northern England|North of England]].

[[Southern Cone]] is the name that is often referred to as the southernmost area of [[South America]] that, in the form of an inverted "cone", almost like a large peninsula, encompasses [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and the entire South of [[Brazil]] (Brazilian states of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] and [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]). Rarely does the meaning broaden to [[Bolivia]], and in the most restricted sense it only covers Chile, Argentina and Uruguay.

The country of [[South Africa]] is so named because of its location at the southern tip of Africa. Upon formation the country was named the [[Union of South Africa]] in English, reflecting its origin from the unification of four formerly separate British colonies. [[Australia]] derives its name from the Latin [[Terra Australis]] ("Southern Land"), a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient times.

==Other uses==
In the card game [[contract bridge|bridge]], one of the players is known for scoring purposes as South. South partners with North and plays against East and West.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEB|6|81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek religion, Notos, was the south wind and bringer of the storms of late summer and autumn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2455">In [[mathematics]], the '''splitting principle''' is a technique used to reduce questions about [[vector bundle]]s to the case of [[line bundle]]s.

In the theory of vector bundles, one often wishes to simplify computations, say of [[Chern classes]].  Often computations are well understood for line bundles and for direct sums of line bundles.  In this case the splitting principle can be quite useful.  

{{math_theorem|Let &lt;math&gt;\xi\colon E\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; be a vector bundle of rank &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; over a [[paracompact space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  There exists a space &lt;math&gt;Y=Fl(E)&lt;/math&gt;, called the flag bundle associated to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and a map &lt;math&gt;p\colon Y\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that 

#the induced cohomology homomorphism &lt;math&gt;p^*\colon H^*(X)\rightarrow H^*(Y)&lt;/math&gt; is injective, and
#the pullback bundle &lt;math&gt;p^*\xi\colon p^*E\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; breaks up as a direct sum of line bundles: &lt;math&gt;p^*(E)=L_1\oplus L_2\oplus\cdots\oplus L_n.&lt;/math&gt;}}

The theorem above holds for complex vector bundles and integer coefficients or for real vector bundles with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt; coefficients. In the complex case, the line bundles &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt; or their first [[characteristic class]]es are called '''Chern roots.''' 

The fact that &lt;math&gt;p^*\colon H^*(X)\rightarrow H^*(Y)&lt;/math&gt; is injective means that any equation which holds in &lt;math&gt;H^*(Y)&lt;/math&gt; (say between various Chern classes) also holds in &lt;math&gt;H^*(X)&lt;/math&gt;.  

The point is that these equations are easier to understand for direct sums of line bundles than for arbitrary vector bundles, so equations should be understood in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and then pushed down to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

==Symmetric polynomial==
Under the splitting principle, characteristic classes for complex vector bundles correspond to [[symmetric polynomials]] in the first Chern classes of complex line bundles; these are the [[Chern class]]es.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16515">A '''statistical model''' is a [[mathematical model]] that embodies a set of [[statistical assumptions]] concerning the generation of some [[Sample (statistics)|sample data]] and similar data from a larger [[Statistical population|population]]. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process.

The assumptions embodied by a statistical model describe a set of [[probability distribution]]s, some of which are assumed to adequately approximate the distribution from which a particular data set is sampled. The probability distributions inherent in statistical models are what distinguishes statistical models from other, non-statistical, mathematical models.

A statistical model is usually specified by mathematical equations that relate one or more [[random variables]] and possibly other non-random variables.  As such, a statistical model is "a formal representation of a theory" ([[Herman J. Adèr|Herman Adèr]] quoting [[Kenneth A. Bollen|Kenneth Bollen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adèr|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LCnOj4ZFyjkC&amp;pg=PA280 280]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical hypothesis tests]] and all [[Estimator|statistical estimators]] are derived from statistical models. More generally, statistical models are part of the foundation of [[statistical inference]].

==Introduction==
Informally, a statistical model can be thought of as a [[statistical assumption]] (or set of statistical assumptions) with a certain property: that the assumption allows us to calculate the probability of any [[event (probability theory)|event]]. As an example, consider a pair of ordinary six-sided [[dice]]. We will study two different statistical assumptions about the dice.

The first statistical assumption is this: for each of the dice, the probability of each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) coming up is {{sfrac|1|6}}. From that assumption, we can calculate the probability of both dice coming up 1:&amp;thinsp; {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|6}} × {{sfrac|1|6}}&amp;ensp;{{=}}}}&amp;ensp;{{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|36}}.&amp;thinsp;}} More generally, we can calculate the probability of any event: e.g. (1 and 2) or (3 and 3) or (4 and 6). 

The alternative statistical assumption is this: for each of the dice, the probability of the face 1 coming up is {{sfrac|1|8}} (because the dice are [[Dice#Loaded_dice|weighted]]). From that assumption, we can calculate the probability of both dice coming up 1:&amp;thinsp; {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|8}} × {{sfrac|1|8}}&amp;ensp;{{=}}}}&amp;ensp;{{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|64}}.&amp;thinsp;}} We cannot, however, calculate the probability of any other nontrivial event. 

The first statistical assumption constitutes a statistical model: because with the assumption alone, we can calculate the probability of any event. The alternative statistical assumption does ''not'' constitute a statistical model: because with the assumption alone, we cannot calculate the probability of every event.

In the example above, with the first assumption, calculating the probability of an event is easy. With some other examples, though, the calculation can be difficult, or even impractical (e.g. it might require millions of years of computation). For an assumption to constitute a statistical model, such difficulty is acceptable: doing the calculation does not need to be practicable, just theoretically possible.

==Formal definition==
In mathematical terms, a statistical model is usually thought of as a pair (&lt;math&gt;S, \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the set of possible observations, i.e. the [[sample space]], and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of [[probability distributions]] on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="McCullagh"&gt;{{Harvnb | McCullagh | 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intuition behind this definition is as follows.  It is assumed that there is a "true" probability distribution induced by the process that generates the observed data.  We choose &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; to represent a set (of distributions) which contains a distribution that adequately approximates the true distribution. Note that we do not require that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; contains the true distribution, and in practice that is rarely the case. Indeed, as Burnham &amp; Anderson state, "A model is a simplification or approximation of reality and hence will not reflect all of reality"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Burnham | Anderson | 2002 | loc= §1.2.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;whence the saying "[[all models are wrong]]".

The set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is almost always parameterized: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;. The set &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; defines the [[Statistical parameter|parameters]] of the model. A parameterization is generally required to have distinct parameter values give rise to distinct distributions, i.e. &lt;math&gt;P_{\theta_1} = P_{\theta_2} \Rightarrow \theta_1 = \theta_2&lt;/math&gt; must hold (in other words, it must be [[Injective function|injective]]). A parameterization that meets the requirement is said to be ''[[Identifiability|identifiable]]''.&lt;ref name="McCullagh" /&gt;

==An example==
Suppose that we have a population of school children, with the ages of the children distributed [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniformly]], in the population. The height of a child will be [[stochastic]]ally related to the age: e.g. when we know that a child is of age 7, this influences the chance of the child being 5 feet tall. We could formalize that relationship in a [[linear regression]] model, like this: 
height&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;age&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the intercept, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a parameter that age is multiplied by in obtaining a prediction of height, ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the error term, and ''i'' identifies the child. This implies that height is predicted by age, with some error.

An admissible model must be consistent with all the data points.  Thus, a straight line (height&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;age&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) cannot be the equation for a model of the data—unless it exactly fits all the data points, i.e. all the data points lie perfectly on the line.  The error term, ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, must be included in the equation, so that the model is consistent with all the data points.

To do [[statistical inference]], we would first need to assume some probability distributions for the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  For instance, we might assume that the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; distributions are [[i.i.d.]] Gaussian, with zero mean.  In this instance, the model would have 3 parameters: ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the variance of the Gaussian distribution.

We can formally specify the model in the form (&lt;math&gt;S, \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;) as follows.  The sample space, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, of our model comprises the set of all possible pairs (age, height).  Each possible value of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) determines a distribution on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;; denote that distribution by &lt;math&gt;P_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all possible values of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;. (The parameterization is identifiable, and this is easy to check.)

In this example, the model is determined by (1) specifying &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and (2) making some assumptions relevant to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;. There are two assumptions: that height can be approximated by a linear function of age; that errors in the approximation are distributed as i.i.d. Gaussian.  The assumptions are sufficient to specify &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;mdash;as they are required to do.

==General remarks==
A statistical model is a special class of [[mathematical model]]. What distinguishes a statistical model from other mathematical models is that a statistical model is non-[[Deterministic system|deterministic]]. Thus, in a statistical model specified via mathematical equations, some of the variables do not have specific values, but instead have probability distributions; i.e. some of the variables are [[Random variable|stochastic]]. In the example above, ε is a stochastic variable; without that variable, the model would be deterministic.

Statistical models are often used even when the physical process being modeled is deterministic. For instance, [[coin tossing]] is, in principle, a deterministic process; yet it is commonly modeled as stochastic (via a [[Bernoulli process]]).

There are three purposes for a statistical model, according to Konishi&amp;nbsp;&amp; Kitagawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Konishi | Kitagawa | 2008 | loc= &amp;sect;1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimension of a model==
Suppose that we have a statistical model (&lt;math&gt;S, \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The model is said to be ''[[Parametric model|parametric]]'' if &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; has a finite dimension. In notation, we write that &lt;math&gt;\Theta \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|k}} is a positive integer (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[real numbers]]; other sets can be used, in principle).  Here, {{mvar|k}} is called the '''dimension''' of the model.

As an example, if we assume that data arise from a univariate [[Gaussian distribution]], then we are assuming that  
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\left\{P_{\mu,\sigma }(x) \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \exp\left( -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) : \mu \in \mathbb{R}, \sigma &gt; 0 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
In this example, the dimension, {{mvar|k}}, equals 2.

As another example, suppose that the data consists of points ({{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}) that we assume are distributed according to a straight line with i.i.d. Gaussian residuals (with zero mean).  Then the dimension of the statistical model is 3: the intercept of the line, the slope of the line, and the variance of the distribution of the residuals.  (Note that in geometry, a straight line has [[dimension]] 1.)

Although formally &lt;math&gt;\theta \in \Theta&lt;/math&gt; is a single parameter that has dimension {{mvar|k}}, it is sometimes regarded as comprising {{mvar|k}} separate parameters. For example, with the univariate Gaussian distribution, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a single parameter with dimension 2, but it is sometimes regarded as comprising 2 separate parameters—the mean and the standard deviation.

A statistical model is [[Nonparametric statistics#Non-parametric models|''nonparametric'']] if the parameter set &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional.  A statistical model is [[Semiparametric model|''semiparametric'']] if it has both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional parameters.  Formally, if {{mvar|k}} is the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; and {{mvar|n}} is the number of samples, both semiparametric and nonparametric models have &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;k/n \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, then the model is semiparametric; otherwise, the model is nonparametric.

Parametric models are by far the most commonly used statistical models. Regarding semiparametric and nonparametric models, [[David Cox (statistician)|Sir David Cox]] has said, "These typically involve fewer assumptions of structure and distributional form but usually contain strong assumptions about independencies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Cox | 2006 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nested models==
{{distinguish|Multilevel models|}}
Two statistical models are '''nested''' if the first model can be transformed into the second model by imposing constraints on the parameters of the first model. As an example, the set of all Gaussian distributions has, nested within it, the set of zero-mean Gaussian distributions: we constrain the mean in the set of all Gaussian distributions to get the zero-mean distributions. As a second example, the quadratic model 
:{{math|''y''&amp;nbsp;{{=}} ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ε,&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ε&amp;nbsp;~ 𝒩(0, ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} 
has, nested within it, the linear model 
:{{math|''y''&amp;nbsp;{{=}} ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&amp;nbsp;+ ε,&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ε&amp;nbsp;~ 𝒩(0, ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}
—we constrain the parameter {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} to equal 0.

In both those examples, the first model has a higher dimension than the second model (for the first example, the zero-mean model has dimension&amp;nbsp;1).  Such is often, but not always, the case.  As a different example, the set of positive-mean Gaussian distributions, which has dimension 2, is nested within the set of all Gaussian distributions.

==Comparing models==
{{main | Model selection}}
It is assumed that there is a "true" probability distribution underlying the observed data, induced by the process that generated the data. The main goal of [[model selection]] is to make statements about which elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; are most likely to adequately approximate the true distribution.

Models can be compared to each other by [[exploratory data analysis]] or [[confirmatory data analysis]]. In exploratory analysis, a variety of models are formulated and an assessment is performed of how well each one describes the data. In confirmatory analysis, a previously formulated model or models are compared to the data. Common criteria for comparing models include [[Coefficient of determination|''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Bayes factor]], and the [[likelihood-ratio test]] together with its generalization [[Likelihood function#Relative likelihood|relative likelihood]].

Konishi &amp; Kitagawa state: "The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modeling. They are typically formulated as comparisons of several statistical models."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Konishi | Kitagawa | 2008 | page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, [[David Cox (statistician)|Sir David Cox]] has said, "How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Cox | 2006 | page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 953 — The [[arithmetic]] of the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] at first required the use of a dust board (a sort of handheld [[blackboard]]) because “the methods required moving the numbers around in the calculation and rubbing some out as the calculation proceeded.” [[Al-Uqlidisi]] modified these methods for [[pen]] and [[paper]] use. Eventually the advances enabled by the [[Decimal|decimal system]] led to its standard use throughout the region and the world.

* c. 1400 — [[Ghiyath al-Kashi]] “contributed to the development of [[decimal fraction]]s not only for approximating [[algebraic number]]s, but also for [[real number]]s such as [[pi]]. His contribution to decimal fractions is so major that for many years he was considered as their inventor.  Although not the first to do so, al-Kashi gave an algorithm for calculating [[nth root]]s which is a special case of the methods given many centuries later by [[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]] and [[William George Horner|Horner]].” He is also the first to use the [[decimal point]] notation in [[arithmetic]] and [[Arabic numerals]]. His works include ''The Key of arithmetics, Discoveries in mathematics, The Decimal point'', and ''The benefits of the zero''. The contents of the ''Benefits of the Zero'' are an introduction followed by five essays: “On whole number arithmetic”, “On fractional arithmetic”, “On astrology”, “On areas”, and “On finding the unknowns [unknown variables]”. He also wrote the ''Thesis on the sine and the chord'' and ''Thesis on finding the first degree sine''.

In [[quantum mechanics]], the '''uncertainty principle''' (also known as '''Heisenberg's uncertainty principle''') is any of a variety of [[Inequality (mathematics)|mathematical inequalities]]&lt;ref name=Sen2014&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sen | first1 = D. | title = The Uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics | url = http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/107/02/0203.pdf | journal = Current Science | volume = 107| issue = 2| year = 2014| pages = 203–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a [[particle]], known as [[Complementarity (physics)|complementary variables]], such as [[Position (vector)|position]] ''x'' and [[momentum]] ''p'', can be known.

Introduced first in 1927, by the German physicist  [[Werner Heisenberg]], it states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"&gt;{{Citation |first=W. |last=Heisenberg |title=Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik  |language=de|journal=[[Zeitschrift für Physik]] |volume=43 |issue=3–4 |year=1927 |pages=172–198 |doi=10.1007/BF01397280 |postscript=. |bibcode = 1927ZPhy...43..172H }}.

Historically, the uncertainty principle has been confused&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Furuta|first=Aya|title=One Thing Is Certain: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle Is Not Dead|journal=Scientific American|year=2012|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heisenbergs-uncertainty-principle-is-not-dead/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ozawa2003"&gt;{{Citation|last=Ozawa|first=Masanao|title=Universally valid reformulation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle on noise and disturbance in measurement|journal=Physical Review A|volume=67|year=2003|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.67.042105|arxiv = quant-ph/0207121 |bibcode = 2003PhRvA..67d2105O|issue=4 |pages=42105}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a somewhat similar effect in [[physics]], called the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]], which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems, that is, without changing something in a system. Heisenberg utilized such an observer effect at the quantum level (see below) as a physical "explanation" of quantum uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Heisenberg, ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become clearer, however, that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all [[wave|wave-like systems]],&lt;ref name="Rozema"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rozema | first1 = L.

Since the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics, typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it. Certain experiments, however, may deliberately test a particular form of the uncertainty principle as part of their main research program.

The evolution of an initially very localized gaussian wave function of a free particle in two-dimensional space, with color and intensity indicating phase and amplitude.

Note that the waves shown here are real for illustrative purposes only, whereas in quantum mechanics the wave function is generally complex.]]

The uncertainty principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt; So it is helpful to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.

Mathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''ħk''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].

In [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|Ψ}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Laloë |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Matter wave|de Broglie hypothesis]], every object in the universe is a [[wave]], i.e., a situation which gives rise to this phenomenon. The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or momentum ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\hbar} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname P [a \leq X \leq b] = \int_a^b |\psi(x)|^2 \, \mathrm{d}x ~.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of the single-moded plane wave, &lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. 

On the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \propto \sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\hbar}~, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \varphi(p) \cdot e^{i p x/\hbar} \, dp ~, &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.

One way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&amp;nbsp;''σ''. Since &lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.

The precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. Another way of stating this is that σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below. This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound. Click the ''show'' button below to see a semi-formal derivation of the Kennard inequality using wave mechanics.

!Proof of the Kennard inequality using wave mechanics
|-
|We are interested in the [[variance]]s of position and momentum, defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx - \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p^2 \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp - \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty p \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp \right)^2~.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Without loss of generality]], we will assume that the [[expected value|means]] vanish, which just amounts to a shift of the origin of our coordinates. (A more general proof that does not make this assumption is given below.) This gives us the simpler form

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p^2 \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp~.&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x \cdot \psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as a [[vector space|vector]] in a [[function space]]. We can define an [[inner product]] for a pair of functions ''u''(''x'') and ''v''(''x'') in this vector space:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle u \mid v \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty u^*(x) \cdot v(x) \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where the asterisk denotes the [[complex conjugate]].

With this inner product defined, we note that the variance for position can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \langle f \mid f \rangle ~.&lt;/math&gt;

We can repeat this for momentum by interpreting the function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}(p)=p \cdot \varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; as a vector, but we can also take advantage of the fact that &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; are Fourier transforms of each other. We evaluate the inverse Fourier transform through [[integration by parts]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} g(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tilde{g}(p) \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty p \cdot \varphi(p) \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2 \pi \hbar} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ p \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(\chi) e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \right] \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{i}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ \cancel{ \left. \psi(\chi) e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \right|_{-\infty}^\infty } - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d\psi(\chi)}{d\chi} e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \right] \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{-i}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d\psi(\chi)}{d\chi} e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \, e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \left( -i \hbar \frac{d}{dx} \right) \cdot \psi(x) ,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the canceled term vanishes because the wave function vanishes at infinity. Often the term &lt;math&gt;-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is called the momentum operator in position space. Applying [[Parseval's theorem]], we see that the variance for momentum can be written as

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\tilde{g}(p)|^2 \, dp = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |g(x)|^2 \, dx = \langle g \mid g \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] asserts that
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 = \langle f \mid f \rangle \cdot \langle g \mid g \rangle \ge |\langle f \mid g \rangle|^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The modulus squared of any complex number ''z'' can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;|z|^{2} = \Big(\text{Re}(z)\Big)^{2}+\Big(\text{Im}(z)\Big)^{2} \geq \Big(\text{Im}(z)\Big)^{2}=\Big(\frac{z-z^{\ast}}{2i}\Big)^{2}. &lt;/math&gt;
we let &lt;math&gt;z=\langle f|g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z^{*}=\langle g\mid f\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and substitute these into the equation above to get

:&lt;math&gt;|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2 \geq \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g \mid f \rangle}{2i}\bigg)^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

All that remains is to evaluate these inner products.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle = {} &amp; \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \, x \cdot \left(-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}\right) \, \psi(x) \, dx \\
&amp;{} - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \, \left(-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}\right) \cdot x \, \psi(x) \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \left[ \left(-x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right) + \frac{d(x \psi(x))}{dx} \right] \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \left[ \left(-x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right) + \psi(x) + \left(x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right)\right] \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \psi(x) \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this into the above inequalities, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 \ge |\langle f \mid g \rangle|^2 \ge \left(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2i}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{i \hbar}{2 i}\right)^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
or taking the square root

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}~.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the only ''physics'' involved in this proof was that &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; are wave functions for position and momentum, which are Fourier transforms of each other. A similar result would hold for ''any'' pair of conjugate variables.

===Matrix mechanics interpretation===
(Ref &lt;ref name="L&amp;L"/&gt;) 
{{Main article|Matrix mechanics}}
In matrix mechanics, observables such as position and momentum are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s. When considering pairs of observables,  an important quantity is the ''[[commutator]]''. For a pair of operators {{mvar|Â}} and {{mvar|B̂}},  one defines their commutator as
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{B}\hat{A}.&lt;/math&gt;
In the case of position and momentum, the commutator is the [[canonical commutation relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i \hbar.&lt;/math&gt;

The physical meaning of the non-commutativity can be understood by considering the effect of the commutator on position and momentum [[eigenstate]]s. Let &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a right eigenstate of position with a constant eigenvalue {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. By definition, this means that &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}|\psi\rangle = x_0 |\psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt; Applying the commutator to &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}] | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x}\hat{p}-\hat{p}\hat{x}) | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) \hat{p} \, | \psi \rangle = i \hbar | \psi \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|Î}} is  the [[identity matrix|identity operator]].

Suppose, for the sake of [[proof by contradiction]], that &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is also a right eigenstate of momentum, with constant eigenvalue {{mvar|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If this were true, then  one could write
:&lt;math&gt;(\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) \hat{p} \, | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) p_0 \, | \psi \rangle = (x_0 \hat{I} - x_0 \hat{I})  p_0 \, | \psi \rangle=0.&lt;/math&gt;
On the other hand, the above canonical commutation relation requires that
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}] | \psi \rangle=i \hbar | \psi \rangle \ne 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum eigenstate.

When a state is measured, it is projected onto an eigenstate in the basis of the relevant observable. For example, if a particle's position is measured, then the state amounts to a position eigenstate. This means that the state is ''not'' a momentum eigenstate, however, but rather it can be represented  as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates. In other words, the momentum must be less precise. This precision may be quantified by the [[standard deviation]]s,  
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x=\sqrt{\langle \hat{x}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{x}\rangle^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p=\sqrt{\langle \hat{p}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{p}\rangle^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

As in the wave mechanics interpretation above, one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two, quantified by the uncertainty principle.

==Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relations==
The most common general form of the uncertainty principle is the ''[[Howard Percy Robertson|Robertson]] uncertainty relation''.&lt;ref name="Robertson1929"&gt;{{Citation|last=Robertson|first=H. P.|title=The Uncertainty Principle|journal=Phys. Rev.|year=1929|volume=34|pages=163–64|bibcode = 1929PhRv...34..163R |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.34.163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an arbitrary [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian operator]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{O}}&lt;/math&gt; we can associate a standard deviation

:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\mathcal{O}} = \sqrt{\langle \hat{\mathcal{O}}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{\mathcal{O}}\rangle^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where the brackets &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathcal{O}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; indicate an [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]]. For a pair of operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;, we may define their ''[[commutator]]'' as

:::&lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{B}\hat{A},&lt;/math&gt;

In this notation, the Robertson uncertainty relation is given by

::: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_A \sigma_B \geq \left| \frac{1}{2i}\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right| = \frac{1}{2}\left|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right|,&lt;/math&gt;

The Robertson uncertainty relation immediately [[Logical consequence|follows from]] a slightly stronger inequality, the ''Schrödinger uncertainty relation'',&lt;ref name="Schrodinger1930"&gt;{{Citation | last = Schrödinger |first = E. | title = Zum Heisenbergschen Unschärfeprinzip | journal = Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Physikalisch-mathematische Klasse | volume = 14 | pages = 296–303 | year = 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

!Proof of the Schrödinger uncertainty relation

|The derivation shown here incorporates and builds off of those shown in Robertson,&lt;ref name="Robertson1929" /&gt; Schrödinger&lt;ref name="Schrodinger1930" /&gt; and standard textbooks such as Griffiths.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2005"&gt;{{Citation|last=Griffiths|first=David|title=Quantum Mechanics|year=2005|publisher=Pearson|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; For any Hermitian operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt;, based upon the definition of [[variance]], we have

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 = \langle(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

we let &lt;math&gt;|f\rangle=|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and thus

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 = \langle f\mid f\rangle\, .&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for any other Hermitian operator &lt;math&gt; \hat{B} &lt;/math&gt; in the same state

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_B^2 = \langle(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi\rangle = \langle g\mid g\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; |g\rangle=|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The product of the two deviations can thus be expressed as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2\sigma_B^2 = \langle f\mid f\rangle\langle g\mid g\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

In order to relate the two vectors &lt;math&gt;|f\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|g\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, we use the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]&lt;ref name="Riley2006"&gt;{{Citation | last = Riley | first = K. F. | author2 = M. P. Hobson and S. J. Bence | title = Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering | publisher = Cambridge | year = 2006 | pages = 246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid f\rangle\langle g\mid g\rangle \geq |\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2, &lt;/math&gt;

and thus Eq. ({{EquationNote|1}}) can be written as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A^2\sigma_B^2 \geq |\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Since &lt;math&gt; \langle f\mid g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is in general a complex number, we use the fact that the modulus squared of any complex number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;|z|^2=zz^{*}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;z^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The modulus squared can also be expressed as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; |z|^2 = \Big(\operatorname{Re}(z)\Big)^2+\Big(\operatorname{Im}(z)\Big)^2 = \Big(\frac{z+z^\ast}{2}\Big)^2 +\Big(\frac{z-z^\ast}{2i}\Big)^2. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

we let &lt;math&gt;z=\langle f\mid g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z^{*}=\langle g \mid f \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and substitute these into the equation above to get

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2 = \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle+\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2}\bigg)^2 + \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2i}\bigg)^2 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is written out explicitly as

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle = \langle(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

and using the fact that &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt; are Hermitian operators, we find

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle f\mid g\rangle &amp; = \langle\Psi|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A}\rangle)(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B}\rangle)\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; = \langle\Psi\mid(\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{A}\langle \hat{B}\rangle - \hat{B}\langle \hat{A}\rangle + \langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle)\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; = \langle\Psi\mid\hat{A}\hat{B}\Psi\rangle-\langle\Psi\mid\hat{A}\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Psi\rangle
-\langle\Psi\mid\hat{B}\langle \hat{A}\rangle\Psi\rangle+\langle\Psi\mid\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; =\langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle+\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; =\langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we have

:::&lt;math&gt;
\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle+\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle = \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle+\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle+\langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle = \langle \{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle -2\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

We now substitute the above two equations above back into Eq. ({{EquationNote|4}}) and get
:::&lt;math&gt;
|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2=\Big(\frac{1}{2}\langle\{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle - \langle \hat{A} \rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{1}{2i} \langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle\Big)^{2}\, .
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above into Eq. ({{EquationNote|2}}) we get the Schrödinger uncertainty relation

:::&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_A\sigma_B \geq \sqrt{\Big(\frac{1}{2}\langle\{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle - \langle \hat{A} \rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{1}{2i} \langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle\Big)^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This proof has an issue&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Davidson|first=E. R.|title=On Derivations of the Uncertainty Principle|journal=J. Chem.

For the proof to make sense, the vector &lt;math&gt; \hat{B} |\Psi \rangle&lt;/math&gt; has to be in the domain of the [[unbounded operator]] &lt;math&gt; \hat{A}&lt;/math&gt;, which is not always the case. In fact, the Robertson uncertainty relation is false if &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an angle variable and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative with respect to this variable.

It suffices to assume that they are merely [[Self-adjoint operator#Symmetric operators|symmetric operators]].

===Examples===

Since the Robertson and Schrödinger relations are for general operators, the relations can be applied to any two observables to obtain specific uncertainty relations. A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.
* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] &lt;math&gt;[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar&lt;/math&gt; implies the Kennard inequality from above:
:: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:
:: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{J_i} \sigma_{J_j} \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \big|\langle J_k\rangle\big|,&lt;/math&gt;
: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes angular momentum along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for &lt;math&gt;[J_x, J_y] = i \hbar \varepsilon_{xyz} J_z&lt;/math&gt;, a choice &lt;math&gt;\hat{A} = J_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{B} = J_y&lt;/math&gt;, in angular momentum multiplets, ''ψ'' = |''j'', ''m''〉, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, &lt;math&gt;\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) ≥ ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j'' ≥ ''m'', among others.
*{{anchor|Time–energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]]. Nevertheless, in 1945, [[Leonid Mandelshtam|L. I. Mandelshtam]] and [[Igor Tamm|I. E. Tamm]] derived a non-relativistic '''''time–energy uncertainty relation''''', as follows.&lt;ref&gt;L. I. Mandelshtam, I. E.

:: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_E \frac{\sigma_B}{\left| \frac{\mathrm{d}\langle \hat B \rangle}{\mathrm{d}t}\right |} \ge \frac{\hbar}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
: where σ&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard deviation of the energy operator (Hamiltonian) in the state {{mvar|ψ}}, σ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; stands for the standard deviation of ''B''. Although the second factor in the left-hand side has dimension of time, it is different from the time parameter that enters the [[Schrödinger equation]]. It is a ''lifetime'' of the state {{mvar|ψ}} with respect to the observable ''B'': In other words, this is the ''time interval'' (Δ''t'') after which the expectation value &lt;math&gt;\langle\hat B\rangle&lt;/math&gt; changes appreciably.
: An informal, heuristic meaning of the principle is the following: A state that only exists for a short time cannot have a definite energy. To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time–energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.&lt;ref&gt;The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

: The same linewidth effect also makes it difficult to specify the [[rest mass]] of unstable, fast-decaying particles in [[particle physics]]. The faster the [[particle decay]]s (the shorter its lifetime), the less certain is its mass (the larger the particle's [[Resonance (particle physics)|width]]).

===Energy–time uncertainty principle{{anchors|Energy–time uncertainty principle}}===
Other than the position–momentum uncertainty relation, the most important uncertainty relation is that between energy and time. The energy–time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson–Schrödinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \Delta E \Delta t \gtrsim h,&lt;/math&gt;

but it was not always obvious what &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked "To violate the time–energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!"&lt;ref name="C Jansson"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One ''false'' formulation of the energy–time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; requires a time interval &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &gt; h/\Delta E&lt;/math&gt;. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.

Another common misconception is that the energy–time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated—energy can be "borrowed" from the universe as long as it is "returned" within a short amount of time.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2005"/&gt;   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron–positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.

In 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time–energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of "events".&lt;ref&gt;see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/&lt;/ref&gt;

===A counterexample===
Suppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, which we may take to lie in the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;. Define "position" and "momentum" operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt; by

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\psi(\theta)=\theta\psi(\theta),\quad \theta\in [0,2\pi],&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\psi=-i\hbar\frac{d\psi}{d\theta},&lt;/math&gt;

where we impose periodic boundary conditions on &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the definition of &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; depends on our choice to have &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; range from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. These operators satisfy the usual commutation relations for position and momentum operators, &lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=i\hbar&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi-\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi=i\hbar\psi&lt;/math&gt; whenever both &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi&lt;/math&gt; are defined, and the space of such &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a dense subspace of the quantum Hilbert space. See  {{Citation | last = Hall | first = B. C. | title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians | publisher = Springer | year = 2013 | pages = 245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now let &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; be any of the eigenstates of &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;, which are given by &lt;math&gt;\psi(\theta)=e^{2\pi in\theta}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that these states are normalizable, unlike the eigenstates of the momentum operator on the line. Note also that the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, since &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; ranges over a bounded interval. Thus, in the state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the uncertainty of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is zero and the uncertainty of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is finite, so that 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A\sigma_B=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Although this result appears to violate the Robertson uncertainty principle, the paradox is resolved when we note that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is not in the domain of the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt;, since multiplication by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; disrupts the periodic boundary conditions imposed on &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hall2013"/&gt; Thus, the derivation of the Robertson relation, which requires &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi&lt;/math&gt; to be defined, does not apply. (These also furnish an example of operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations but not the [[Canonical commutation relation#The Weyl relations|Weyl relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hall | first = B. C. | title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians | publisher = Springer | year = 2013 | pages = 285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

For the usual position and momentum operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; on the real line, no such counterexamples can occur. As long as &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p&lt;/math&gt; are defined in the state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle holds, even if &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; fails to be in the domain of &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; or of &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hall | first = B.

===Quantum harmonic oscillator stationary states===
{{Main article|Quantum harmonic oscillator|Stationary state}}
Consider a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). It is possible to express the position and momentum operators in terms of the [[creation and annihilation operators]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat x = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}(a+a^\dagger)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat p = i\sqrt{\frac{m \omega\hbar}{2}}(a^\dagger-a).&lt;/math&gt;

Using the standard rules for creation and annihilation operators on the eigenstates of the QHO,
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\dagger}|n\rangle=\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a|n\rangle=\sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle, &lt;/math&gt; 
the [[variance]]s may be computed directly,
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \frac{\hbar}{m\omega} \left( n+\frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \hbar m\omega \left( n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\, .&lt;/math&gt;
The product of these standard deviations is then
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \hbar \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}.~&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the above Kennard bound&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt; is saturated for the [[ground state]] {{math|''n''{{=}}0}}, for which the probability density is just the [[normal distribution]].

===Quantum harmonic oscillator with Gaussian initial condition===

In a quantum harmonic oscillator of characteristic angular frequency ω, place a state that is offset from the bottom of the potential by some displacement ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\left(\frac{m \Omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \Omega (x-x_0)^2}{2\hbar}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
where Ω describes the width of the initial state but need not be the same as ω. Through integration over the [[Propagator#Basic Examples: Propagator of Free Particle and Harmonic Oscillator|propagator]], we can solve for the {{Not a typo|full time}}-dependent solution. After many cancelations, the probability densities reduce to
:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi(x,t)|^2 \sim \mathcal{N}\left( x_0 \cos{(\omega t)} , \frac{\hbar}{2 m \Omega} \left( \cos^2(\omega t) + \frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi(p,t)|^2 \sim \mathcal{N}\left( -m x_0 \omega \sin(\omega t), \frac{\hbar m \Omega}{2} \left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where we have used the notation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt; to denote a normal distribution of mean μ and variance σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Copying the variances above and applying [[list of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identities]], we can write the product of the standard deviations as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma_x \sigma_p&amp;=\frac{\hbar}{2}\sqrt{\left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)} \\
&amp;= \frac{\hbar}{4}\sqrt{3+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-1\right) \cos{(4 \omega t)}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From the relations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \ge 2, \quad |\cos(4 \omega t)| \le 1,&lt;/math&gt;

we can conclude the following: (the right most equality holds only when Ω&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ω'') .
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{4}\sqrt{3+\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-1\right)} = \frac{\hbar}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Coherent states===
{{Main article|Coherent state}}
A coherent state is a right eigenstate of the [[annihilation operator]],
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a}|\alpha\rangle=\alpha|\alpha\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
which may be represented in terms of [[Fock state]]s as
:&lt;math&gt;|\alpha\rangle =e^{-{|\alpha|^2\over2}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty {\alpha^n \over \sqrt{n!}}|n\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

In the picture where the coherent state is a massive particle in a QHO, the position and momentum operators may be expressed in terms of the annihilation operators in the same formulas above and used to calculate the variances,
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 m \omega},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \frac{\hbar m \omega}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, every coherent state saturates the Kennard bound

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2 m \omega}} \, \sqrt{\frac{\hbar m \omega}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

with position and momentum each contributing an amount &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\hbar/2}&lt;/math&gt; in a "balanced" way. Moreover, every [[squeezed coherent state]] also saturates the Kennard bound although the individual contributions of position and momentum need not be balanced in general.

===Particle in a box===
{{Main article|Particle in a box}}
Consider a particle in a one-dimensional box of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Particle in a box#Wavefunctions|eigenfunctions in position and momentum space]] are
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(x,t) =
\begin{cases}
A \sin(k_n x)\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\omega_n t}, &amp; 0 &lt; x &lt; L,\\
0, &amp; \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_n(p,t)=\sqrt{\frac{\pi L}{\hbar}}\,\,\frac{n\left(1-(-1)^ne^{-ikL} \right) e^{-i \omega_n t}}{\pi ^2 n^2-k^2 L^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega_n=\frac{\pi^2 \hbar n^2}{8 L^2 m}&lt;/math&gt; and we have used the [[de Broglie relation]] &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k&lt;/math&gt;. The variances of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated explicitly:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2=\frac{L^2}{12}\left(1-\frac{6}{n^2\pi^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2=\left(\frac{\hbar n\pi}{L}\right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

The product of the standard deviations is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{n^2\pi^2}{3}-2}.&lt;/math&gt;
For all &lt;math&gt;n=1, \, 2, \, 3,\, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{n^2\pi^2}{3}-2}&lt;/math&gt; is greater than 1, so the uncertainty principle is never violated. For numerical concreteness, the smallest value occurs when &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, in which case

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi^2}{3}-2} \approx 0.568 \hbar &gt; \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Constant momentum===
{{Main article|Wave packet}}
[[File:Guassian Dispersion.gif|360 px|thumb|right|Position space probability density of an initially Gaussian state moving at minimally uncertain, constant momentum in free space]]
Assume a particle initially has a [[momentum space]] wave function described by a normal distribution around some constant momentum ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; according to

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p) = \left(\frac{x_0}{\hbar \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \exp{\left(\frac{-x_0^2 (p-p_0)^2}{2\hbar^2}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

where we have introduced a reference scale &lt;math&gt;x_0=\sqrt{\hbar/m\omega_0}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; describing the width of the distribution−−cf. [[nondimensionalization]]. If the state is allowed to evolve in free space, then the time-dependent momentum and position space wave functions are

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(p,t) = \left(\frac{x_0}{\hbar \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \exp{\left(\frac{-x_0^2 (p-p_0)^2}{2\hbar^2}-\frac{ip^2 t}{2m\hbar}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t) = \left(\frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \frac{e^{-x_0^2 p_0^2 /2\hbar^2}}{\sqrt{1+i\omega_0 t}} \cdot \exp{\left(-\frac{(x-ix_0^2 p_0/\hbar)^2}{2x_0^2 (1+i\omega_0 t)}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; \langle p(t) \rangle = p_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p(t) = \hbar / x_0 \sqrt{2},&lt;/math&gt; this can be interpreted as a particle moving along with constant momentum at arbitrarily high precision. On the other hand, the standard deviation of the position is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \frac{x_0}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1+\omega_0^2 t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
such that the uncertainty product can only increase with time as
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x(t) \sigma_p(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{1+\omega_0^2 t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Additional uncertainty relations==

===Mixed states===
The Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relation may be generalized in a straightforward way to describe [[density matrix|mixed states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiger|first=Nathan|title=Quantum Uncertainty and Conservation Law Restrictions on Gate Fidelity|url=http://www.physics.byu.edu/Thesis/view.aspx?id=270|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A^2 \sigma_B^2 \geq \left(\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{tr}(\rho\{A,B\}) - \operatorname{tr}(\rho A)\operatorname{tr}(\rho B)\right)^2 +\left(\frac{1}{2i} \operatorname{tr}(\rho[A,B])\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

===The Maccone–Pati uncertainty relations===
The Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relation can be trivial if the state of the system is chosen to be eigenstate of one of the observable. The stronger uncertainty relations proved by Maccone and Pati give non-trivial bounds on the sum of the variances for two incompatible observables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maccone|first1=Lorenzo|last2=Pati|first2=Arun K.|title=Stronger Uncertainty Relations for All Incompatible Observables|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=31 December 2014|volume=113|issue=26|page=260401|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.260401|arxiv=1407.0338|bibcode=2014PhRvL.113z0401M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For two non-commuting observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; the first stronger uncertainty relation is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_{A}^2 + \sigma_{ B}^2 \ge \pm i \langle \Psi\mid [A, B]|\Psi \rangle  + \mid \langle \Psi\mid(A \pm i B)\mid{\bar \Psi} \rangle|^2, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{A}^2 = \langle \Psi |A^2 |\Psi \rangle - \langle \Psi \mid A \mid \Psi \rangle^2   &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{B}^2 = \langle \Psi |B^2 |\Psi \rangle - \langle \Psi \mid B \mid\Psi \rangle^2 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|{\bar \Psi} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is a normalized vector that is orthogonal to the state of the system &lt;math&gt;|\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and  one should choose the sign of  &lt;math&gt;\pm i \langle \Psi\mid[A, B]\mid\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; to make this real quantity a positive number.

The second stronger uncertainty  relation is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 \ge \frac{1}{2}| \langle {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \mid(A + B)\mid \Psi \rangle|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;| {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is a state orthogonal to &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.
The form of &lt;math&gt;| {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \rangle  &lt;/math&gt; implies that the right-hand side of the new uncertainty relation 
is nonzero unless &lt;math&gt;| \Psi\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; is an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;(A + B)&lt;/math&gt;.  One may note that &lt;math&gt;|\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; can be an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;( A+ B)&lt;/math&gt; without being an eigenstate of either
&lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;. However,  when &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is an eigenstate of one of the two observables the Heisenberg–Schrödinger uncertainty relation becomes trivial. But the lower bound in the new relation is nonzero 
unless &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is an eigenstate of both.

===Phase space===
In the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics, the Robertson–Schrödinger relation follows from a positivity condition on a real star-square function. Given a [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution|Wigner function]] &lt;math&gt;W(x,p)&lt;/math&gt; with [[Moyal product|star product]] ★ and a function ''f'', the following is generally true:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T. |last2= Zachos | first2= C. | title = Negative Probability and Uncertainty Relations| journal = Modern Physics Letters A  | volume = 16 | issue = 37 | pages = 2381–2385 | doi = 10.1142/S021773230100576X | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = hep-th/0105226 |bibcode = 2001MPLA...16.2381C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f^* \star f \rangle =\int (f^* \star f) \, W(x,p) \, dx \, dp \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing &lt;math&gt;f=a+bx+cp&lt;/math&gt;, we arrive at

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f^* \star f \rangle =\begin{bmatrix}a^* &amp; b^* &amp; c^* \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star p \rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \langle p \star x \rangle &amp; \langle p \star p \rangle \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a \\ b \\ c\end{bmatrix} \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this positivity condition is true for ''all'' ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', it follows that all the eigenvalues of the matrix are positive. The positive eigenvalues then imply a corresponding positivity condition on the [[determinant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\det\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star p \rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \langle p \star x \rangle &amp; \langle p \star p \rangle \end{bmatrix} = \det\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x^2 \rangle &amp; \left\langle xp + \frac{i\hbar}{2} \right\rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \left\langle xp - \frac{i\hbar}{2} \right\rangle &amp; \langle p^2 \rangle \end{bmatrix} \ge 0,&lt;/math&gt;

or, explicitly, after algebraic manipulation,

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 = \left( \langle x^2 \rangle - \langle x \rangle^2 \right)\left( \langle p^2 \rangle - \langle p \rangle^2 \right)\ge \left( \langle xp \rangle - \langle x \rangle \langle p \rangle \right)^2 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

===Systematic and statistical errors===

The inequalities above focus on the ''statistical imprecision'' of observables as quantified by the standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Heisenberg's original version, however, was dealing with the ''systematic error'', a disturbance of the quantum system produced by the measuring apparatus, i.e., an [[Observer effect (physics)|observer effect]].

If we let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_A&lt;/math&gt; represent the error (i.e., [[accuracy|inaccuracy]]) of a measurement of an observable ''A'' and &lt;math&gt;\eta_B&lt;/math&gt; the disturbance produced on a subsequent measurement of the conjugate variable ''B'' by the former measurement of ''A'', then the inequality proposed by Ozawa&lt;ref name="Ozawa2003"/&gt; — encompassing both systematic and statistical errors — holds:
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_A\, \eta_B + \varepsilon_A \, \sigma_B + \sigma_A \, \eta_B \,\ge\,  \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, as originally described in the 1927 formulation, mentions only the first term of Ozawa inequality, regarding the ''systematic error''.   Using the notation above to describe the ''error/disturbance'' effect of ''sequential measurements'' (first ''A'', then ''B''), it could be written as
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{A} \, \eta_{B} \, \ge \,   \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;

The formal derivation of the Heisenberg relation is possible but far from intuitive.

=== Quantum entropic uncertainty principle ===

For many distributions, the standard deviation is not a particularly natural way of quantifying the structure. For example, uncertainty relations in which one of the observables is an angle has little physical meaning for fluctuations larger than one period.&lt;ref name="CarruthersNieto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=D. |last=Judge |title=On the uncertainty relation for angle variables|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento|year=1964|volume=31|issue=2|pages=332–340|doi=10.1007/BF02733639|bibcode=1964NCim...31..332J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1= M. |last1= Bouten |first2= N. |last2= Maene

A solution that overcomes these issues is an uncertainty based on [[entropic uncertainty]] instead of the product of variances. While formulating the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of quantum mechanics in 1957, [[Hugh Everett III]] conjectured a stronger extension of the uncertainty principle based on entropic certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=DeWitt |first=B.

the Shannon [[Information entropy|information entropies]]

:&lt;math&gt;H_a = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(a) \log(f(a))\,da,&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;H_b = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(b) \log(g(b))\,db&lt;/math&gt;

are subject to the following constraint,

where the logarithms may be in any base.

The probability distribution functions associated with the position wave function {{math|''&amp;psi;(x)''}} and the momentum wave function {{math|''&amp;phi;(x)''}} have dimensions of inverse length and momentum respectively, but the entropies may be rendered dimensionless by

:&lt;math&gt;H_x = - \int |\psi(x)|^2 \ln (x_0\,|\psi(x)|^2 ) \,dx =-\left\langle \ln (x_0\mid\psi(x)|^2 ) \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} are some arbitrarily chosen length and momentum respectively, which render the arguments of the logarithms dimensionless. Note that the entropies will be functions of these chosen parameters. Due to the [[Wavefunction#Relation between wave functions|Fourier transform relation]] between the position wave function {{math|''&amp;psi;(x)''}} and the momentum wavefunction {{math|''&amp;phi;''(''p'')}}, the above constraint can be written for the corresponding entropies as
{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e\,h}{2\,x_0\,p_0}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|h}} is [[Planck's constant]].

Depending on one's choice of the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} product, the expression may be written in many ways. If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is chosen to be {{mvar|h}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If, instead,  {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is chosen to be {{mvar|ħ}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log (e\,\pi)&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are chosen to be unity in whatever system of units are being used, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e\,h }{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|h}} is interpreted as a dimensionless number equal to the value of Planck's constant in the chosen system of units.

The quantum entropic uncertainty principle is more restrictive than the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. From the inverse logarithmic Sobolev inequalities&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=D. |last=Chafaï |title=Gaussian maximum of entropy and reversed log-Sobolev inequality|arxiv=math/0102227 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-36107-7_5 |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-540-00072-3 |pages=194–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_x \le \frac{1}{2} \log ( 2e\pi \sigma_x^2 / x_0^2 )~,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_p \le \frac{1}{2} \log ( 2e\pi \sigma_p^2 /p_0^2 )~,&lt;/math&gt;
(equivalently, from the fact that normal distributions maximize the entropy of all such with a given variance), it readily follows that this entropic uncertainty principle is ''stronger than the one based on standard deviations'', because

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2} \exp\left(H_x + H_p - \log \left(\frac{e\,h}{2\,x_0\,p_0}\right)\right) \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}~.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, is a consequence of the quantum entropic uncertainty principle, but not vice versa.  A few remarks on these inequalities. First, the choice of [[base e]] is a matter of popular convention in physics. The logarithm can alternatively be in any base, provided that it be consistent on both sides of the inequality.  Second, recall the [[Shannon entropy]] has been used, ''not'' the quantum [[von Neumann entropy]].  Finally, the normal distribution saturates the inequality, and it is the only distribution with this property, because it is the [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] among those with fixed variance (cf. [[differential entropy#Maximization in the normal distribution|here]] for proof).

!Entropic uncertainty of the normal distribution
|-
|We demonstrate this method on the ground state of the QHO, which as discussed above saturates the usual uncertainty based on standard deviations. The length scale can be set to whatever is convenient, so we assign

:&lt;math&gt;x_0=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\psi(x) &amp;= \left(\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{2\hbar}\right)} \\
&amp;= \left(\frac{1}{2\pi x_0^2}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{4x_0^2}\right)} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability distribution is the normal distribution
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

with Shannon entropy
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x &amp;= - \int |\psi(x)|^2 \ln (|\psi(x)|^2 \cdot x_0 ) \,dx \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)} \ln \left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)}\right] \, dx \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{u^2}{2}\right)} \left[\ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{u^2}{2}\right] \, du\\
&amp;= \ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{1}{2}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A completely analogous calculation proceeds for the momentum distribution. Choosing a standard momentum of &lt;math&gt;p_0=\hbar/x_0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p) = \left(\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\varphi(p)|^2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}} \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_p &amp;= - \int |\varphi(p)|^2 \ln (|\varphi(p)|^2 \cdot \hbar / x_0 ) \,dp \\
&amp;= -\sqrt{\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)} \ln \left[\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}\right] \, dp \\
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -2v^2\right)} \left[\ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + 2v^2 \right] \, dv \\
&amp;= \ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is therefore the limiting value

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x+H_p &amp;= \ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{1}{2} + \ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\\
&amp;= 1 + \ln \pi = \ln(e\pi).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A measurement apparatus will have a finite resolution set by the discretization of its possible outputs into bins, with the probability of lying within one of the bins given by the Born rule. We will consider the most common experimental situation, in which the bins are of uniform size. Let ''δx'' be a measure of the spatial resolution. We take the zeroth bin to be centered near the origin, with possibly some small constant offset ''c''. The probability of lying within the jth interval of width ''δx'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_j]= \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x-c}^{(j+1/2)\delta x-c}| \psi(x)|^2 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

To account for this discretization, we can define the Shannon entropy of the wave function for a given measurement apparatus as

: &lt;math&gt;H_x=-\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j].&lt;/math&gt;

Under the above definition, the entropic uncertainty relation is

:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p&gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{\delta x \delta p}{h} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here we note that {{math|''δx''&amp;nbsp;''δp''/''h''}} is a typical infinitesimal phase space volume used in the calculation of a [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]]. The inequality is also strict and not saturated. Efforts to improve this bound are an active area of research.

{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="70%" style="text-align:left"
!Normal distribution example

|We demonstrate this method first on the ground state of the QHO, which as discussed above saturates the usual uncertainty based on standard deviations.
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\left(\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{2\hbar}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability of lying within one of these bins can be expressed in terms of the [[error function]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\operatorname P[x_j] &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x}^{(j+1/2)\delta x} \exp\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{\hbar}\right) \, dx \\
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x\sqrt{m \omega / \hbar}}^{(j+1/2)\delta x\sqrt{m \omega / \hbar}} e^{u^2} \, du \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\hbar}}\right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\hbar}}\right) \right]\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The momentum probabilities are completely analogous.

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[p_j] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta p \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar m \omega}}\right)- \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar m \omega}}\right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

For simplicity, we will set the resolutions to

:&lt;math&gt;\delta x = \sqrt{\frac{h}{m \omega}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta p = \sqrt{h m \omega}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the probabilities reduce to

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_j] = \operatorname P[p_j] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

The Shannon entropy can be evaluated numerically.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x = H_p &amp;= -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j] \\
&amp;= -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right] \ln \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right]
&amp;\approx 0.3226\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is indeed larger than the limiting value.
:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p \approx 0.3226 + 0.3226 = 0.6452 &gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln 1 \approx 0.3069&lt;/math&gt;

Note that despite being in the optimal case, the inequality is not saturated.

!Sinc function example
|-
|An example of a unimodal distribution with infinite variance is the [[sinc function]]. If the wave function is the correctly normalized uniform distribution,
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(x)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2a}} &amp; \text{for } |x| \le a, \\[8pt]
0 &amp; \text{for } |x|&gt;a
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
then its Fourier transform is the sinc function,
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)=\sqrt{\frac{a}{\pi \hbar}} \cdot \operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{a p}{\hbar}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
which yields infinite momentum variance despite having a centralized shape. The entropic uncertainty, on the other hand, is finite. Suppose for simplicity that the spatial resolution is just a two-bin measurement, ''δx''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'', and that the momentum resolution is ''δp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''a''.

Partitioning the uniform spatial distribution into two equal bins is straightforward. We set the offset ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2 so that the two bins span the distribution.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_0] = \int_{-a}^0 \frac{1}{2a} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_1] = \int_0^a \frac{1}{2a} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_x = -\sum_{j=0}^{1} \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j] = -\frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{1}{2} = \ln 2&lt;/math&gt;

The bins for momentum must cover the entire real line. As done with the spatial distribution, we could apply an offset. It turns out, however, that the Shannon entropy is minimized when the zeroth bin for momentum is centered at the origin. (The reader is encouraged to try adding an offset.) The probability of lying within an arbitrary momentum bin can be expressed in terms of the [[sine integral]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\operatorname P[p_j] &amp;= \frac{a}{\pi \hbar} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta p}^{(j+1/2)\delta p} \operatorname{sinc}^2\left(\frac{a p}{\hbar}\right) \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{2\pi (j-1/2)}^{2\pi (j+1/2)} \operatorname{sinc}^2(u) \, du \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\pi} \left[ \operatorname {Si} ((4j+2)\pi)- \operatorname {Si} ((4j-2)\pi) \right]\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The Shannon entropy can be evaluated numerically.
:&lt;math&gt;H_p = -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[p_j] \ln \operatorname P[p_j] = -\operatorname P[p_0] \ln \operatorname P[p_0]-2 \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \operatorname P[p_j] \ln \operatorname P[p_j] \approx 0.53&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is indeed larger than the limiting value.
:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p \approx 0.69 + 0.53 = 1.22 &gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln 1 \approx 0.31&lt;/math&gt;

==Harmonic analysis==
{{main article|Fourier transform#Uncertainty principle}}
In the context of [[harmonic analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the uncertainty principle implies that one cannot at the same time localize the value of a function and its [[Fourier transform]]. To wit, the following inequality holds,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 |f(x)|^2\,dx\right)\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \xi^2 |\hat{f}(\xi)|^2\,d\xi\right)\ge \frac{\|f\|_2^4}{16\pi^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Further mathematical uncertainty inequalities, including the above [[entropic uncertainty]], hold between a function {{mvar|f}} and its Fourier transform {{math| ƒ̂}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=V.|last1=Havin|first2= B.|last2=Jöricke|title=The Uncertainty Principle in Harmonic Analysis|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Signal processing {{anchor|Gabor limit}}===
In the context of [[signal processing]], and in particular [[time–frequency analysis]], uncertainty principles are referred to as the '''Gabor limit''', after [[Dennis Gabor]], or sometimes the ''Heisenberg–Gabor limit''. The basic result, which follows from "Benedicks's theorem", below, is that a function cannot be both [[time limited]] and [[band limited]] (a function and its Fourier transform cannot both have bounded domain)—see [[Bandlimiting#Bandlimited versus timelimited|bandlimited versus timelimited]]. Thus

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t \cdot \sigma_f \ge \frac{1}{4\pi} \approx 0.08 \text{ cycles}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_f&lt;/math&gt; are the standard deviations of the time and frequency estimates respectively &lt;ref&gt;Matt Hall, [https://agilescientific.com/blog/2014/1/15/what-is-the-gabor-uncertainty-principle.html "What is the Gabor uncertainty principle?"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Stated alternatively, "One cannot simultaneously sharply localize a signal (function {{mvar|f}} ) in both the [[time domain]] and [[frequency domain]] ({{math| ƒ̂}}, its Fourier transform)".

When applied to filters, the result implies that one cannot achieve high temporal resolution and frequency resolution at the same time; a concrete example are the [[Short-time Fourier transform#Resolution issues|resolution issues of the short-time Fourier transform]]—if one uses a wide window, one achieves good frequency resolution at the cost of temporal resolution, while a narrow window has the opposite trade-off.

Alternate theorems give more precise quantitative results, and, in time–frequency analysis, rather than interpreting the (1-dimensional) time and frequency domains separately, one instead interprets the limit as a lower limit on the support of a function in the (2-dimensional) time–frequency plane. In practice, the Gabor limit limits the ''simultaneous'' time–frequency resolution one can achieve without interference; it is possible to achieve higher resolution, but at the cost of different components of the signal interfering with each other.

===DFT-Uncertainty principle===
There is an uncertainty principle that uses signal sparsity (or the number of non-zero coefficients).&lt;ref name="Donoho"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Donoho |first1=D.L. |last2=Stark |first2=P.B |year=1989 |title=Uncertainty principles and signal recovery |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=906–931 |doi=10.1137/0149053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\left \{ \mathbf{ x_n } \right \} := x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of ''N'' complex numbers and &lt;math&gt;\left \{ \mathbf{X_k} \right \} := X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_{N-1},&lt;/math&gt; its [[discrete Fourier transform]].

===Hardy's uncertainty principle===
The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] formulated the following uncertainty principle:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=G.H.|last=Hardy|authorlink=G. H.

Specifically, if {{mvar|f}} in &lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; is such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)|\leq C(1+|x|)^Ne^{-a\pi x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;|\hat{f}(\xi)|\leq C(1+|\xi|)^Ne^{-b\pi \xi^2}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;C&gt;0,N&lt;/math&gt; an integer),

then, if {{math|1=''ab'' &gt; 1, ''f'' = 0}}, while if {{math|1=''ab'' = 1}}, then there is a polynomial {{mvar|P}} of degree {{math| ≤ ''N''}} such that

::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=P(x)e^{-a\pi x^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This was later improved as follows: if &lt;math&gt;f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt; is such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|f(x)||\hat{f}(\xi)|\frac{e^{\pi|\langle x,\xi\rangle|}}{(1+|x|+|\xi|)^N} \, dx \, d\xi &lt; +\infty ~,&lt;/math&gt;
then
::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=P(x)e^{-\pi\langle Ax,x\rangle} ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|P}} is a polynomial of degree {{math|(''N'' − ''d'')/2}} and {{mvar|A}} is a real {{math|''d''×''d''}} positive definite matrix.

==History==
[[Werner Heisenberg]] formulated the uncertainty principle at [[Niels Bohr]]'s institute in Copenhagen, while working on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08.htm American Physical Society online exhibit on the Uncertainty Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heisenbergbohr.jpg|thumb|Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr]]
In 1925, following pioneering work with [[Hendrik Kramers]], Heisenberg developed [[matrix mechanics]], which replaced the ad hoc [[old quantum theory]] with modern quantum mechanics. The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.

Heisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.

In March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously—the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known. Heisenberg wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;It can be expressed in its simplest form as follows: One can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two important factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles—its position and its velocity. It is impossible to determine accurately ''both'' the position and the direction and speed of a particle ''at the same instant''.&lt;ref&gt;Heisenberg, W., ''Die Physik der Atomkerne'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1952, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his celebrated 1927 paper, "Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik" ("On the Perceptual Content of Quantum Theoretical Kinematics and Mechanics"), Heisenberg established this expression as the minimum amount of unavoidable momentum disturbance caused by any position measurement,&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"/&gt; but he did not give a precise definition for the uncertainties Δx and Δp. Instead, he gave some plausible estimates in each case separately. In his Chicago lecture&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"&gt;{{Citation |first=W. |last=Heisenberg |year=1930 |title=Physikalische Prinzipien der Quantentheorie  |language=de|location=Leipzig |publisher=Hirzel }} English translation ''The Physical Principles of Quantum Theory''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; he refined his principle:

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\Delta x \, \Delta p\gtrsim h&lt;/math&gt;|1}}

[[Earle Hesse Kennard|Kennard]]&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt; in 1927 first proved the modern inequality:

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x\sigma_p\ge\frac{\hbar}{2}&lt;/math&gt;|2}}

where {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''h''|2{{pi}}}}}}, and {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the standard deviations of position and momentum. Heisenberg only proved relation ({{EquationNote|2}}) for the special case of Gaussian states.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

===Terminology and translation===
Throughout the main body of his original 1927 paper, written in German, Heisenberg used the word, "Ungenauigkeit" ("indeterminacy"),&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927" /&gt;
to describe the basic theoretical principle. Only in the endnote did he switch to the word, "Unsicherheit" ("uncertainty"). When the English-language version of Heisenberg's textbook, ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', was published in 1930, however, the translation "uncertainty" was used, and it became the more commonly used term in the English language thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Cassidy |year=2009 |title=Beyond Uncertainty: Heisenberg, Quantum Physics, and the Bomb |location= New York |publisher=Bellevue Literary Press |page=185 |isbn= |bibcode=2010PhT....63a..49C |last2=Saperstein |first2=Alvin M. |volume=63 |journal=Physics Today |doi=10.1063/1.3293416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heisenberg's microscope===
[[File:Heisenberg gamma ray microscope.svg|thumb|200px|right|Heisenberg's gamma-ray microscope for locating an electron (shown in blue). The incoming gamma ray (shown in green) is scattered by the electron up into the microscope's aperture angle ''θ''. The scattered gamma-ray is shown in red. Classical [[optics]] shows that the electron position can be resolved only up to an uncertainty Δ''x'' that depends on ''θ'' and the wavelength ''λ'' of the incoming light.]]
{{Main article|Heisenberg's microscope}}

The principle is quite counter-intuitive, so the early students of quantum theory had to be reassured that naive measurements to violate it were bound always to be unworkable. One way in which Heisenberg originally illustrated the intrinsic impossibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by utilizing the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] of  an imaginary microscope as a measuring device.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

He imagines an experimenter trying to measure the position and momentum of an [[electron]] by shooting a [[photon]] at it.&lt;ref name=GreensteinZajonc2006&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Greenstein|author2=Arthur Zajonc|title=The Quantum Challenge: Modern Research on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics|year=2006|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-2470-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49–50}}
:Problem 1 – If the photon has a short [[wavelength]], and therefore, a large momentum, the position can be measured accurately. But the photon scatters in a random direction, transferring a large and uncertain amount of momentum to the electron. If the photon has a long [[wavelength]] and low momentum, the collision does not disturb the electron's momentum very much, but the scattering will reveal its position only vaguely.

:Problem 2 – If a large [[aperture]] is used for the microscope, the electron's location can be well resolved (see [[Rayleigh criterion]]); but by the principle of [[conservation of momentum]], the transverse momentum of the incoming photon affects the electron's beamline momentum and hence, the new momentum of the electron resolves poorly. If a small aperture is used, the accuracy of both resolutions is the other way around.

The combination of these trade-offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to [[Planck's constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tipler |first=Paul A. |first2=Ralph A. |last2=Llewellyn |title=Modern Physics |edition=3rd |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Co. |year=1999 |isbn=1-57259-164-1 |chapter=5–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heisenberg did not care to formulate the uncertainty principle as an exact limit (which is elaborated below), and preferred to use it instead, as a heuristic quantitative statement, correct up to small numerical factors, which makes the radically new noncommutativity of quantum mechanics inevitable.

==Critical reactions==
{{Main article|Bohr–Einstein debates}}

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle were, in fact, seen as twin targets by detractors who believed in an underlying [[determinism]] and [[Scientific realism|realism]]. According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the [[quantum state]] describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.

[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr–Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.

===The ideal of the detached observer===
[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle "the ideal of the detached observer" (phrase translated from the German):
{{blockquote|"Like the moon has a definite position" Einstein said to me last winter, "whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made." I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.
*Letter from Pauli to Niels Bohr, February 15, 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Enz, Charles P.|editor2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Writings on physics and philosophy by Wolfgang Pauli|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|page=43|postscript=; translated by Robert Schlapp|isbn=3-540-56859-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueTd4g7pc5MC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
===Einstein's slit===
The first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:

:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.

Bohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|Δ''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|Δ''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.

A similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Einstein's box===
Bohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that "Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]]."&lt;ref name="Gamow"&gt;Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.&lt;/ref&gt; Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. "We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; "Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle."&lt;ref name="Gamow" /&gt;

Bohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, "since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,"&lt;ref&gt;Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt; because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].
"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

===EPR paradox for entangled particles===
Bohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=452 |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the "natural basic assumption" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from "locally changing deterministic quantities" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.

In 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be "hidden" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's "basic assumption" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.

While it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables are not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption—that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Popper's criticism ===
{{main article|Popper's experiment}}
[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = [[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]] | publisher = Hutchinson &amp; Co. | year = 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as "statistical scatter relations".&lt;ref name="Popper1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarvie2006"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment, | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory. This directly contrasts with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which is [[Determinism|non-deterministic]] but lacks local hidden variables.

In 1934, Popper published ''Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen'' (''Critique of the Uncertainty Relations'') in ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'',&lt;ref name="Popper1934"&gt;{{Citation | title = Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen (Critique of the Uncertainty Relations) | journal = Naturwissenschaften | year = 1934 | first = Karl | last = Popper | author2 = Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | volume = 22 | issue = 48 | pages = 807–808 | doi=10.1007/BF01496543|bibcode = 1934NW.....22..807P | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|Logik der Forschung]]'' (translated and updated by the author as ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' in 1959), outlining his arguments for the statistical interpretation. In 1982, he further developed his theory in ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Heisenberg's] formulae are, beyond all doubt, derivable ''statistical formulae'' of the quantum theory. But they have been ''habitually misinterpreted'' by those quantum theorists who said that these formulae can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the ''precision of our measurements''. [original emphasis]&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K. ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', Unwin Hyman Ltd, 1982, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Popper proposed an experiment to [[Falsifiability|falsify]] the uncertainty relations, although he later withdrew his initial version after discussions with [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker|Weizsäcker]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]; this experiment may have influenced the formulation of the [[EPR paradox|EPR experiment]].&lt;ref name="Popper1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehra2001"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mehra | first1 = Jagdish | last2 = Rechenberg | first2 = Helmut | title = The Historical Development of Quantum Theory | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-387-95086-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Many-worlds uncertainty ===
{{main article|Many-worlds interpretation}}

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] originally outlined by [[Hugh Everett III]] in 1957 is partly meant to reconcile the differences between Einstein's and Bohr's views by replacing Bohr's [[wave function collapse]] with an ensemble of deterministic and independent universes whose ''distribution'' is governed by [[wave function]]s and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Thus, uncertainty in the many-worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge of what goes on in the other universes.

=== Free will ===

Some scientists including [[Arthur Compton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.74.1911.172| title = The Uncertainty Principle and Free Will| journal = Science| volume = 74| issue = 1911| pages = 172| year = 1931| last1 = Compton | first1 = A. H. | pmid=17808216|bibcode = 1931Sci....74..172C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Heisenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/459164a| title = Is free will an illusion?| journal = Nature| volume = 459| issue = 7244| pages = 164–165| year = 2009| last1 = Heisenberg | first1 = M. |bibcode = 2009Natur.459..164H }}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the uncertainty principle, or at least the general probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, could be evidence for the two-stage model of free will. One critique, however, is that apart from the basic role of quantum mechanics as a foundation for chemistry, [[Quantum biology|nontrivial biological mechanisms requiring quantum mechanics]] are unlikely, due to the rapid [[decoherence]] time of quantum systems at room temperature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biosystems.2004.07.001| pmid = 15555759| title = Does quantum mechanics play a non-trivial role in life?| journal = Biosystems| volume = 78| issue = 1–3| pages = 69–79| year = 2004| last1 = Davies | first1 = P. C. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard view, however, is that this decoherence is  overcome by both screening and decoherence-free subspaces found in biological cells.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==The second law of thermodynamics==

There is reason to believe that violating the uncertainty principle also strongly implies the violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Hanggi, S. Wehner, A violation of the uncertainty principle also implies the violation of the second law of thermodynamics; 2012, arXiv:1205.6894v1 (quant-phy).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Whitehead Prize''' is awarded yearly by the [[London Mathematical Society]] to multiple mathematicians working in the [[United Kingdom]] who are at an early stage of their career. The prize is named in memory of [[homotopy]] theory pioneer [[J. H. C. Whitehead]].

More specifically, people being considered for the award must be resident in the United Kingdom on 1 January of the award year or must have been educated in the United Kingdom. Also, the candidates must have less than 15 years of work at the postdoctorate level and must not have received any other prizes from the Society.

Since the inception of the prize, no more than two could be awarded per year, but in 1999 this was increased to four “to allow for the award of prizes across the whole of mathematics, including applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and mathematical aspects of computer science.”

The '''[[Senior Whitehead Prize]]''' has similar residence requirements and rules concerning prior prizes, but is intended to recognize more experienced mathematicians.
