}}
1733 was the 37th English [[cricket]] season since the earliest known [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match]] was played. Details have survived of twelve [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important matches]]. Two local matches played in [[Hampshire]] are the earliest known to have been played in the county. 

== Important matches ==
The following matches are classified as [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important]]:&lt;ref name="status" group="fc"&gt;First-class cricket was officially defined in May 1894 by a meeting at [[Lord's]] of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) and the [[county cricket|county clubs]] which were then competing in the [[County Championship]]. The ruling was effective from the beginning of the 1895 season. Pre-1895 matches of the same standard have no official definition of status because the ruling is not retrospective and the [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important matches]] designation, as applied to a given match, is based on the views of one or more substantial historical sources. For further information, see [[First-class cricket]], [[Forms of cricket]] and [[History of cricket]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Played for a prize of thirty [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]]. Little is known about either of these teams, which have few mentions in the surviving records and may not have been part of the sport's mainstream. No details are known of the players involved and so the strengths of the two teams cannot now be determined but the stake was high and the match was reported in a newspaper, ''Berington's Evening Post''.

Advertised as for one guinea each man with wickets to be pitched at one o’clock and the spectators to keep outside the line round the ground.

The Kent v Middlesex &amp; Surrey match was arranged immediately after the match on or about Wed 11 July by [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]] and [[Edwin Stead]]. The Prince of Wales awarded a silver cup to the winners of the Wednesday, 1 August match and this is the first known instance of a cup being played for. This is also mentioned in ''Kent Cricket Matches''.

The announcement in the ''St James Evening Post'' (Sat 25 to Tues 28 August) states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"On Friday next a great Match at Cricket will be play’d on Molesey (''sic'') Hurst; by 11 of the best Players in the County on each Side, for a Wager of 100 Guineas between His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, and the Right Honorable, the Lord Gage".&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Waghorn reported this in ''Dawn of Cricket'' as being on the following Friday, 7 September, and he confusingly recorded the county as Suffolk when it was in fact Sussex. Lord Gage was the former [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]]. The Prince of Wales was by now completely taken with cricket and had become another great patron of the sport.

The same game seems to be dated 20 September in ''Dawn of Cricket'' which may be a Gregorian equivalent, although it is possible by reference to a game reported by Buckley in 1736 that ''Dawn of Cricket'' has got the year wrong, let alone the day and month. The game reported in ''Kent Cricket Matches'' is correctly dated Monday, 10 September (Julian Calendar). ''Kent Cricket Matches'' and ''Dawn of Cricket'' both report word for word a condition about roping the enclosure.

This seems to be the earliest known result wherein the win was by a certain number of wickets, unless the Richmond v Chambers game in 1731 was actually conceded by Richmond. London scored 65 &amp; 35; Kent scored 71 "and the second hands of the Kentish men won the wager and had three men to spare".

Team scores are known: Croydon 95 &amp; 76; London 89 &amp; 41-5. Time expired and it was drawn. Croydon had three given men and it was reported that the betting reached record levels, but that statement could not have been verifiable even at the time. The Croydon team was called "the country men". The report says a rematch would take place at the Artillery Ground "on Wednesday next".

This was the rematch of the previous game. London had a lead of 8 runs when play was abandoned because of rain, but it is not known what stage the game had reached. Reported in the ''[[Whitehall Evening Post]]'' dated Saturday 29 September.

==Other events==
''Tuesday, 22 May''. The earliest known match in [[Hampshire]] took place at [[Stubbington]], near [[Portsmouth]], when a team of bachelors were beaten "most shamefully" by a team of married men. The report for this and the following match was found in the ''[[American Weekly Mercury]]'', a [[Philadelphia]] newspaper, dated 20 to 27 September 1733.&lt;ref name=IM59&gt;Maun, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tuesday, 29 May''. The return match of the above took place at [[Titchfield]] and the married men won again.&lt;ref name=IM59/&gt;

The '''2014''' [[South American Beach Games]] (Spanish:''Juegos Suramericanos de Playa''), officially the '''III South American Beach Games''', is an international [[multi-sport event]] that is being held in [[Vargas, Venezuela]], from May 14 – 24. It was slated to take place from 3 to 13 December 2013, but the Games was postponed at the time. This was due to athletes not able to get airline tickets to the event. Also, the infrastructure needed for the Games were not quite ready to receive the athletes. Therefore, [[ODESUR]] has allowed Vargas to continue preparing the venues for the Games.

==Participating teams==
All 14 nations of the Organización Deportiva Suramericana (ODESUR) are expected to compete in these Beach Games.

'''Allen Arena''' is an [[List of indoor arenas|indoor arena]] at [[Lipscomb University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The [[arena]] was named in honor of James C. and Linda Allen, the facility's primary benefactors. James Allen is a member of the board of trustees for the university and worked for the university at one time. The arena is primarily used for basketball and volleyball athletic events and is also used for daily chapel services and occasional concerts.&lt;ref name="facil"&gt;[http://www.lipscombsports.com/facilities/allenarena/ Allen Arena Facilities] at lipscombsports.com, URL accessed November 6, 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5l5p18cEI?url=http://www.lipscombsports.com/facilities/allenarena/ |date=2009-11-06 }} 11/5/09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
Other than hosting athletic events and on campus convocations, the arena hosts many events such as dinners, concerts, area-wide worship services, and graduations (the university and Nashville surrounding high schools). The facility has been host to events such as the annual [[Minnie Pearl]] Cancer Foundation Concert, bringing entertainers such as former Vibe host [[Sinbad (actor)|Sinbad]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Dana Carvey]], and [[Jay Leno]].

Besides being the home of Lipscomb sports teams, it served as the home of the now-defunct Nashville franchise, the [[Nashville Rhythm]], in the revived [[American Basketball Association (2000-)|American Basketball Association]]. It is now also the home of the [[Music City Stars]], an [[American Basketball Association (2000–present)|American Basketball Association]] team.&lt;ref name="facil"/&gt;

==History==
The Allen Arena opened on October 28, 2001, with a local worship service called "In His Hands". The Arena and adjacent parking garage was the site for the school's old McQuiddy Gym name after  J.C. McQuiddy  Part of the McQuiddy Gym was retained along with the adjacent Student Activities Center (SAC). Yearwood Hall, a women's dormitory, was torn down for construction of the arena.

In the first Lipscomb Bisons home game at Allen Arena, Bison Clayton Osborne made a in bounds shot from three-quarters of the court away. With no time remaining, the ball fell through the net, giving the Bisons a 78-77 victory over the North Texas Eagles.

The arena hosted the 2008 and 2009 [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] men's basketball tournaments.&lt;ref name="facil"/&gt;

Due to the damage incurred to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] House during the [[May 2010 Tennessee floods]] and because the [[Ryman Auditorium]] was unavailable, Allen Arena hosted the June 5 and June 15, 2010 editions of the Grand Ole Opry.&lt;ref&gt;http://search2.opry.com/?view=events&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, the arena held the nationally-televised [[44th GMA Dove Awards]] for the [[Christian music]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=44th Annual GMA Dove Awards|url=http://www.ticketsnashville.com/websales/pages/TicketSearchCriteria.aspx?evtinfo=58263~b8848ad3-00db-4563-927e-996af53ac6db|publisher=Tickets Nashville|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capacity==
Arena [[seating capacity]] is between 4,000 and 5,000 depending upon the purpose for which it is being used, and is officially given as 5,028, which is the capacity in the format typically utilized.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;[http://nashville.metromix.com/theater/theater/lipscomb-university-allen-arena-green-hills/527644/content Lipscomb University, Allen Arena] at nashville.metromix.com, URL accessed November 6, 2009. {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5l5p9y9Ok?url=http://nashville.metromix.com/theater/theater/lipscomb-university-allen-arena-green-hills/527644/content|date=2009-11-06}} 11/6/09&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bigi Wey Sports Center''' is a sports venue located in [[Brokopondo District]], [[Suriname]].  It hosted a knockout tournament marking the 150th-anniversary of Suriname’s emancipation day.&lt;ref name="nieuws-suriname.com"/&gt;

In 2009, the Ilonka Elmont Foundation conducted a research into sports venues, sports needs and sports participation in [[Brownsweg]]. They inferred that [[Brownsweg]] needed a sports venue and planned to make one.&lt;ref name="nieuws-suriname.nl"/&gt; The construction was a joint project of Rosabel Goldmines, the Ilonka Elmont Foundation and the [[KNVB]] (Royal Dutch Football Federation).&lt;ref name="starnieuws.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/3026|title=Starnieuws - Modern stadion voor Brokopondo en Sipaliwini|website=www.starnieuws.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==

Constructed in 2010,&lt;ref name="starnieuws.com"/&gt; it was officially opened with a ceremony in 2012.&lt;ref name="dbsuriname.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbsuriname.com/dbsuriname/index.php/bigi-wey-sportcentrum-officieel-van-gemeenschap-brokopondo/|title=Bigi Wey Sportcentrum officieel van gemeenschap Brokopondo|website=Dagblad Suriname}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsuitable weather forced the inspection of the field to be rescheduled.&lt;ref name="dbsuriname.com"/&gt;

The construction cost amounted to over 625000 dollars in total.&lt;ref name="starnieuws.com"/&gt;

==Facilities==

The complex contains a field with floodlights for competitive games, a cafeteria, a first aid room, storage space, two restrooms and a parking lot.&lt;ref name="nieuws-suriname.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuws-suriname.nl/bigi-wey-sportcentrum-een-maatschappelijke-en-sportieve-boost-voor-brokopondo/|title=Bigi Wey Sportcentrum, een maatschappelijke en sportieve boost voor Brokopondo - Nieuws-Suriname - Live nieuws en radio stream uit Suriname!|website=www.nieuws-suriname.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to growing popularity and national recognition of lacrosse, the first-ever [[Albany Great Danes men's lacrosse]] game was held at Bob Ford Field on April 18, 2015. It was the first time since March 10, 2007 that a top-10 matchup was held in the Capital District, with #4 UAlbany defeating #10 Delaware 13-7. Since then, multiple top-25 in the nation games have been held there. The official seating capacity for lacrosse at Casey Stadium is 6,394.&lt;ref&gt;https://dailygazette.com/article/2017/05/10/possible-ncaa-record-attendance-for-ua-game&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">'''[[Boxing]] at the [[Friendship Games]]''' took place at the [[Coliseo de la Ciudad Deportiva|Ciudad Deportiva]] in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. The boxing schedule began on 18 August and ended on 24 August 1984. Twelve boxing events (all men's individual) were contested.

Notably, Cuba – the host nation – won 11 out of 12 gold medals.

Ironically, even though they were called the Friendship Games, boxing doesn't come close to friendship because it involves hurting people.

The '''Football Federation of Turkmenistan'''  ({{lang-tm|Türkmenistanyň Futbol Federasiýasy}}) is the governing body of football in [[Turkmenistan]].

== History ==
The Federation was founded in 1992 and in 1994 was admitted to [[FIFA]], which registers all the matches of the national teams of all member countries. The national team of Turkmenistan registered their first matches as being held in 1992, and FIFA counted those matches on the basis that, although the Football Federation of Turkmenistan became a member of FIFA in 1994, the national team of Turkmenistan was allowed since 1992 to participate in tournament play. The Federation additionally boasts membership in the [[Asian Football Confederation]] since 1994.

In March 2003 Football Federation of Turkmenistan held a special conference. As a result of a secret ballot, Allaberdy Mammetkuliyev was elected Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkmenistan.ru/ru/node/14899 ФЕДЕРАЦИЯ ФУТБОЛА ТУРКМЕНИСТАНА ПРЕОБРАЗОВАНА В АССОЦИАЦИЮ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, FIFA President [[Joseph S. Blatter]] and  AFC President [[Mohamed Bin Hammam]] opened the House of Football - new headquarters of the Football Association of Turkmenistan - which is located in one of the luxury houses in the southern part of [[Ashgabat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkmenistan.ru/en/node/5478 Presidents of FIFA and AFC inaugurate football headquarters in Turkmen capital]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/president/news/newsid=122479/index.html Joseph S. Blatter in Central Asia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The May 2008 election saw just one nomination for the position of Chairman: [[Deryageldy Orazov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkmenistan.ru/en/node/7021 Deriyageldy Orazov elected chairman of Football Federation of Turkmenistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The May 2012 election saw another change in leadership, as Vice Premier [[Sapardurdy Toylyev]] was unanimously voted Chairman by the delegates present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkmenistan.ru/en/articles/16272.html Vice-Premier Sapardurdy Toyliyev elected chairman of Football Federation of Turkmenistan]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the conference adopted a new logo.

The Grand Canyon University Arena officially opened its doors on September 2, 2011, just 15 months after the University announced the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Year’s Wait Is Over: Welcome, GCU Arena!|url=http://news.gcu.edu/2011/09/a-year%E2%80%99s-wait-is-over-welcome-gcu-arena/|work=GCU Today|date=September 2, 2011|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the arena was part of the University's $200 million campus expansion and growth. It will regularly host Christian and secular concerts, outside performances, speaking engagements, Grand Canyon University athletic events, and commencement ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GCU Arena Bringing Christian-Friendly Shows to Phoenix|first=Ed|last=Masley|url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/music/articles/2011/08/26/20110826phoenix-concert-venue-grand-canyon-university-christian.html|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=August 26, 2011|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to the arena, the university is in the process of upgrading the athletics facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Track to Benefit Athletes and Others on Campus|first=Amber|last=Christenburry|url=http://news.gcu.edu/2011/10/new-track-to-benefit-athletes-and-others-on-campus/|work=GCU Today|date=October 4, 2011|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006034148/http://news.gcu.edu/2011/10/new-track-to-benefit-athletes-and-others-on-campus/|archivedate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; building new classroom space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Formal Groundbreaking for New CAS Building|first=Doug|last=Carroll|url=http://news.gcu.edu/2011/10/formal-groundbreaking-for-new-cas-building/|work=GCU Today|date=October 18, 2011|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; dormitories, and other educational facilities on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grand Canyon University Breaks Ground on Event Center|first=Michelle|last=Ye Hee Lee|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2010/06/26/20100626grand-canyon-university-groundbreaking-events-center.html|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=June 26, 2010|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Privacy Policy|url=http://www.gcu.edu/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=50&amp;cntnt01returnid=69|publisher=Grand Canyon University|date=June 19, 2008|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports teams and other events==
The GCU Arena is home to Grand Canyon University's Lopes men’s and women’s basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About|url=http://www.gcuarena.com/about/|publisher=Grand Canyon University|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GCU plays host to Christian and secular concerts, outside performances, speaking engagements, athletic events, and commencement ceremonies. Previous acts include: [[Casting Crowns]], [[David Crowder Band]], [[M-1 Global|M-1 Global Challenge]], [[Switchfoot]], Pandora’s Unforgettable Moments on Ice featuring [[David Archuleta]] and [[Mannheim Steamroller]], [[Lady Antebellum]], and [[Third Day]].

On October 14, 2012, the arena hosted [[Impact Wrestling|TNA Wrestling]]'s 8th annual premier [[pay-per-view]] of the year, [[Bound for Glory (2012)|Bound for Glory]].&lt;ref name="BFG2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=TNA's Bound For Glory PPV Is Coming To Phoenix, Arizona On October 14 |url=http://www.impactwrestling.com/news/item/3616-TNA-s-Bound-For-Glory-PPV-Is-Coming-To-Phoenix,-Arizona-On-October-14 |publisher=[[Impact Wrestling|Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] |date=July 5, 2012 |accessdate=July 5, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facility information==
[[Image:GCU Arena Interior.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Inside of Grand Canyon University Arena, one hour prior to a [[Grand Canyon Antelopes men's basketball|men's basketball]] game.]]
There are over 5,000 seats in the 135,000-square-foot arena. There are also five concession stands (including three pizza ovens), 17 restrooms, four locker rooms, two escalators, two elevators, two grand staircases and a total of four high definition video boards and one high resolution digital ribbon board. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arena Facts |url=http://www.gcuarena.com/downloads/arena_facts.pdf |publisher=Grand Canyon University |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528112350/http://www.gcuarena.com/downloads/arena_facts.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state-of-the-art video boards were installed by Atlanta-based Innovation Sports Marketing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Innovation Sports Marketing|url=http://innovationsports.net/|publisher=Innovation Sports Marketing|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main video board measures 15 feet tall by 35 feet wide and weighs around three tons.

Design for the facility was done by [[360 Architecture]] and Tempe-based Architekton. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grand Canyon University Arena|url=http://www.architekton.com/community/77/profile/|publisher=Architekton|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When construction of the arena was complete there were a total of 255,000 man hours, 8,870 yards of concrete, 41,000 bricks, 793 tons of structural steel, 75 miles of electrical wiring, and 2,300 light fixtures.

Notable features include large windows providing natural light, ceiling beams signed by GCU employees and students, a vault of Bibles buried at center court and an outdoor balcony with views of the Camelback Road campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bible Buried in Arena Center Court Ceremony|first=Doug|last=Carroll|url=http://news.gcu.edu/2011/05/bible-buried-in-arena-center-court-ceremony/|work=GCU Today|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are only 42 steps from event level to concourse level to ensure that every seat in the arena is a good one.

==Expansion==
Just over three years after opening, GCU Arena closed on March 3, 2014 to undergo a massive remodel.  With the quicker than anticipated jump to [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] athletics for the [[Grand Canyon Antelopes]] athletic programs, the school announced the expansion of the arena from a capacity of 5,000 to 7,000 seats.  The growth of the arena was primarily intended to incorporate adequate seating for the [[Grand Canyon Antelopes men's basketball|men's basketball]] games and for larger concerts.

Arizona sports icon [[Jerry Colangelo]], who is closely connected with the athletic program, was involved in the expansion process, stating: "If GCU knew when the building went up just a couple of years ago that they would be in Division I as quickly as we have, it would have been built bigger." &lt;ref&gt;http://ktar.com/22/1685113/GCU-to-expand-seating-at-new-arena&lt;/ref&gt;

After a proposed finish date of October 17, the Arena opened nearly six weeks ahead of schedule on August 23 for a [[Switchfoot]] concert as a part of the school's 2014 Welcome Weekend.  Final changes included an upper-deck seating area, a movable track for the high definition video display, and a new basketball floor.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.gcu.edu/2014/08/done-expanded-arena-ready-unveiled/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hellenic Cup''' ({{lang-el|Ελληνικό Κύπελλο|translit=Ellinikό Kypello}}) is an Australian [[football (soccer)]] tournament contested by [[Greek Australian]] clubs, mostly from [[Melbourne, Victoria]] . Starting in 1983, it was an attempt to formalise the previously scattered approach to holding such tournaments in the 1960s and 1970s.

The Hellenic Cup Tournament trophy is housed in the Museum of National Centre for Hellenic Studies &amp; Research at [[La Trobe University]], Bundoora.

'''High-intensity interval training''' ('''HIIT'''), also called '''high-intensity intermittent exercise''' ('''HIIE''') or '''sprint interval training''' ('''SIT'''), is a form of [[interval training]], a [[cardiovascular exercise]] strategy alternating short periods of intense [[anaerobic exercise]] with less intense recovery periods, until too exhausted to continue. Though there is no universal HIIT session duration, these intense workouts typically last under 30 minutes, with times varying based on a participant's current fitness level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dohiit.com/hiit-faq/#What_is_High-Intensity_Interval_Training|title=HIIT FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions about High-Intensity Interval Training)|work=DOHIIT|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIIT workouts provide improved athletic capacity and [[physical exercise|condition]] as well as improved [[carbohydrate metabolism|glucose metabolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Laursen PB, Jenkins DG |title=The Scientific Basis for High-Intensity Interval Training|journal=Sports Medicine|volume=32|issue=1|pages=53–73|date=2002|pmid=11772161|doi=10.2165/00007256-200232010-00003|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with other regimens, HIIT may not be as effective for treating [[hyperlipidemia]] and [[obesity]], or improving muscle and bone mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nybo|first=Lars|last2=Sundstrup|first2=Emil|last3=Jakobsen|first3=Markus D.|last4=Mohr|first4=Magni|last5=Hornstrup|first5=Therese|last6=Simonsen|first6=Lene|last7=Bülow|first7=Jens|last8=Randers|first8=Morten B.|last9=Nielsen|first9=Jens J.|date=2010-10-01|title=High-intensity training versus traditional exercise interventions for promoting health|journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|volume=42|issue=10|pages=1951–1958|doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181d99203|issn=1530-0315|pmid=20195181}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research has shown that HIIT regimens produced significant reductions in the fat mass of the whole-body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Haifeng|last2=Tong|first2=Tom K.|last3=Qiu|first3=Weifeng|last4=Zhang|first4=Xu|last5=Zhou|first5=Shi|last6=Liu|first6=Yang|last7=He|first7=Yuxiu|date=2017-01-01|title=Comparable Effects of High-Intensity Interval Training and Prolonged Continuous Exercise Training on Abdominal Visceral Fat Reduction in Obese Young Women|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jdr/2017/5071740/|journal=Journal of Diabetes Research|language=en|volume=2017|pages=1–9|doi=10.1155/2017/5071740|issn=2314-6745|pmc=5237463|pmid=28116314}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some researchers also note that HIIT requires "an extremely high level of subject motivation" and question whether the general population could safely or practically tolerate the extreme nature of the exercise regimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gibala MJ|title=High-intensity Interval Training: A Time-efficient Strategy for Health Promotion?|journal=Current Sports Med Rep|volume=6|issue=4|pages=211–13|date=July 2007|pmid=17617995|doi=10.1007/s11932-007-0033-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
HIIT exercise sessions generally consist of a [[Warming up|warm up period]], then several repetitions of high-intensity exercise separated by medium intensity exercise for recovery, then a cool down period. The high-intensity exercise should be done at near maximum intensity. The medium exercise should be about 50% intensity. The number of repetitions and length of each depends on the exercise, but may be as little as three repetitions with just 20 seconds of intense exercise &lt;ref name="NYT Well Blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/one-minute-workout/|title=Got a Minute? Let's Work Out}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific exercises performed during the high-intensity portions vary. Most of the research on HIIT has been done using a cycling ergometer, but other exercises like running, stair climbing and uphill walking can also be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillen|first=Jenna B.|last2=Gibala|first2=Martin J.|date=2013-09-27|title=Is high-intensity interval training a time-efficient exercise strategy to improve health and fitness?|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/apnm-2013-0187|journal=Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism|volume=39|issue=3|pages=409–412|doi=10.1139/apnm-2013-0187|issn=1715-5312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no specific formula to HIIT. Depending on one's level of cardiovascular development, the moderate-level intensity can be as slow as walking A common formula involves a 2:1 ratio of work to recovery periods, for example, 30–40 seconds of hard sprinting alternated with 15–20 seconds of jogging or walking, repeated to failure.

The entire HIIT session may last between four and thirty minutes, meaning that it is considered to be an excellent way to maximize a workout that is limited by time constraints.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/20/exercise-workout-shorter-forbeslife-cx_avd_1020health.html|title=Ten ways to get more from your workout|publisher=Forbes|date=October 20, 2008|accessdate=December 14, 2008|author=Van Dusen, Allison}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Use of a clock or timer is recommended to keep accurate times, the number of rounds, and intensity.

===Peter Coe regimen===
A type of high-intensity interval training with short recovery periods was used in the 1970s by the athletics coach [[Peter Coe]] when setting sessions for his son [[Sebastian Coe]]. Inspired by the principles propounded by the German coach and university professor [[Woldemar Gerschler]] and the Swedish physiologist [[Per-Olof Åstrand]], Coe set sessions involving repeated fast 200 metre runs with only 30 seconds recovery between each fast run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sebastian|last=Coe|title=Running My Life|publisher=Hodder|year=2013|isbn=978-1-444-73253-5|pages=38, 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tabata regimen===
A version of HIIT was based on a 1996 study&lt;ref name="pmid8897392"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8897392 |doi=10.1097/00005768-199610000-00018|title=Effects of moderate-intensity endurance and high-intensity intermittent training on anaerobic capacity and VO2max|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|volume=28|issue=10|pages=1327–30|year=1996|last1=Tabata|first1=Izumi|last2=Nishimura|first2=Kouji|last3=Kouzaki|first3=Motoki|last4=Hirai|first4=Yuusuke|last5=Ogita|first5=Futoshi|last6=Miyachi|first6=Motohiko|last7=Yamamoto|first7=Kaoru}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Professor [[Izumi Tabata]] (田畑泉) et al. initially involving [[speedskating|Olympic speedskaters]]. The study used 20&amp;nbsp;seconds of ultra-intense exercise (at an intensity of about 170% of [[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max]]) followed by 10&amp;nbsp;seconds of rest, repeated continuously for 4&amp;nbsp;minutes (8 cycles). The exercise was performed on a mechanically braked [[cycle ergometer]]. Tabata called this '''the IE1 protocol'''.&lt;ref name="pmid9139179"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9139179 |doi=10.1097/00005768-199703000-00015|title=Metabolic profile of high intensity intermittent exercises|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|volume=29|issue=3|pages=390–5|year=1997|last1=Tabata|first1=Izumi|last2=Irisawa|first2=Kouichi|last3=Kouzaki|first3=Motoki|last4=Nishimura|first4=Kouji|last5=Ogita|first5=Futoshi|last6=Miyachi|first6=Motohiko}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original study, athletes using this method trained 4 times per week, plus another day of steady-state training, for 6 weeks and obtained gains similar to a group of athletes who did [[Continuous training|steady state training]] (70% VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max) 5 times per week. The steady state group had a higher VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max at the end (from 52 to 57&amp;nbsp;mL/(kg•min)), but the Tabata group had started lower and gained more overall (from 48 to 55&amp;nbsp;mL/(kg•min)). Also, only the Tabata group had gained [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic capacity]] benefits. In the original study from 1996, participants were disqualified if they could not keep a steady cycling pace of 85RPM for the full 20 seconds of work.{{Relevance inline|sentence|reason=This sentence is probably meant to qualify the significance of the study's findings, but it doesn't say how.}}

In popular culture, "Tabata training" has now come to refer to a wide variety of HIIT protocols and exercise regimens &lt;ref name=tabataexercises&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beginner's Guide To Tabata Workouts|url=https://noobnorm.com/beginners-guide-to-tabata-workouts/#best-tabata-exercises|publisher=Noob Norm|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may or may not have similar benefits to those found in Tabata's original study.

===Gibala regimen===
Professor Martin Gibala and his  team at [[McMaster University]] in Canada have been researching high-intensity exercise for several years. Their 2010 study on students&lt;ref name=pmid20100740&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20100740 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2009.181743|title=A practical model of low-volume high-intensity interval training induces mitochondrial biogenesis in human skeletal muscle: Potential mechanisms|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=588|issue=6|pages=1011–22|year=2010|last1=Little|first1=J. P.|last2=Safdar|first2=A.|last3=Wilkin|first3=G. P.|last4=Tarnopolsky|first4=M. A.|last5=Gibala|first5=M. J.|pmc=2849965}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses 3 minutes for warming up, then  60 seconds of intense exercise (at 95% of VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max) followed by 75 seconds of rest, repeated for 8–12 cycles (sometimes referred to as "The Little Method"). Subjects using this method training 3 times per week obtained gains similar to what would be expected from subjects who did steady state (50–70% VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max) training five times per week. While still a demanding form of training, this exercise protocol could be used by the general public with nothing more than an average exercise bike.

Gibala's group published a less intense version of their regimen in a 2011 paper in ''[[Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise]]''. This was intended as a gentler option for sedentary people who had done no exercise for over a year. It included 3 minutes of warm-up, 10 repetitions of 60-second bursts at 60% peak power (80–95% of [[Heart rate#Heart rate reserve|heart rate reserve]]) each followed by 60 seconds of recovery, and then a 5-minute cool-down.&lt;ref name=Hood2011&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21448086 |doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e3182199834|title=Low-Volume Interval Training Improves Muscle Oxidative Capacity in Sedentary Adults|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|volume=43|issue=10|pages=1849–56|year=2011|last1=Hood|first1=Melanie S.|last2=Little|first2=Jonathan P.|last3=Tarnopolsky|first3=Mark A.|last4=Myslik|first4=Frank|last5=Gibala|first5=Martin J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zuniga regimen===
Jorge Zuniga, assistant professor of exercise science at [[Creighton University]], set out to determine how to fit the highest volume of work and oxygen consumption into the smallest amount of time.  He found that intervals of 30 seconds at 90% of power output at VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max followed by 30 seconds of rest allowed for the highest VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption and the longest workout duration at specified intensity.  Alternative protocols considered included 100% of maximum power output on the same interval schedule, similar to the Coe regimen, and 90% of maximum power output for three minutes, similar to traditional interval training.&lt;ref name=Zuniga&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zuniga JM, Berg K, Noble J, Harder J, Chaffin ME, Hanumanthu VS |title=Physiological responses during interval training with different intensities and duration of exercise|journal=Journal of strength and conditioning research|volume=25|issue=5|pages=1279–84|date=May 2011|pmid=21522072|doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181d681b6|type=Primary Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuniga's protocol has been implemented to great success by his students participating in  Creighton's Army [[ROTC]] program.  Cadets completing the protocol twice a week saw greater improvements in [[United States Army Physical Fitness Test|APFT]] scores than in years past.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Vollaard regimen===
Dr Niels Vollaard at the [[University of Stirling]] proposed that when high-intensity intervals are done at ‘all-out’ intensities, associated health benefits plateau after performing 2 or 3 sprint repetitions. This led to the development of a 10-minute exercise routine consisting of easy pedalling interspersed with two 20-second ‘all-out’ cycling sprints.&lt;ref name=Metcalfe&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Metcalfe RS, Babraj JA, Fawkner SG, Vollaard NB|title=Towards the minimal amount of exercise for improving metabolic health: beneficial effects of reduced-exertion high-intensity interval training|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=112|issue=7|pages=2767–75|date=Jul 2012|pmid=22124524|doi=10.1007/s00421-011-2254-z|type=Primary Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2017 meta-analysis, Vollaard indeed showed that common protocols with as many as 6 to 10 repetitions of 30-second ‘all-out’ sprints do not improve aerobic fitness more than the ‘2x20-s’ protocol.&lt;ref name=Vollaard&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Vollaard NB, Metcalfe RS, Williams S|title=Effect of Number of Sprints in an SIT Session on Change in VO2max: A Meta-analysis|journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|volume=49|issue=6|pages=1147–1156|date=Jun 2017|pmid=28079707|doi=10.1249/MSS.0000000000001204|type=Primary Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that this short protocol may remove many of the drawbacks that make other high-intensity interval training protocols unsuitable for the general population.&lt;ref name="Vollaard/Metcalfe"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Vollaard NB, Metcalfe RS|title=Research into the Health Benefits of Sprint Interval Training Should Focus on Protocols with Fewer and Shorter Sprints|journal=Sports Medicine|date=Apr 2017|pmid=28391489|doi=10.1007/s40279-017-0727-x|type=Primary Article|volume=47|pmc=5684281|pages=2443–2451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a BBC ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' programme in February 2012, Jamie Timmons, professor of systems biology at the [[University of Loughborough]], put [[Michael Mosley (BBC)|Michael Mosley]] through this exercise bike regimen, but with three sprints instead of two. This was done three times a week for a total of 30 minutes of exercise per week (3 minutes of intense exercise), plus warm-up and recovery time.

==Regimen comparison==
Wood et al. compared high-intensity interval training of eight 1-minute bouts at 85% Wmax interspersed with a 1-minute active recovery at 25% Wmax v Sprint interval training  of eight 30-second bouts at 130% Wmax interspersed with 90-second active recovery at 25% Wmax. (Total time matched at 24 mins including warm up &amp; cool down). Their conclusion was "HIIT is the recommended routine" but "the magnitude of differences in various parameters between regimens was small; therefore, preference for either modality may be up to the individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1519/JSC.0000000000001042 |pmid=26691413 |title=Dissimilar Physiological and Perceptual Responses Between Sprint Interval Training and High-Intensity Interval Training |journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=244–50 |year=2016 |last1=Wood |first1=Kimberly M. |last2=Olive |first2=Brittany |last3=Lavalle |first3=Kaylyn |last4=Thompson |first4=Heather |last5=Greer |first5=Kevin |last6=Astorino |first6=Todd A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==

===Cardiovascular fitness===
A 2015 [[systematic review]] and meta-analysis of [[randomized controlled trial]]s found that HIIT training and traditional endurance training both lead to significantly improved [[cardiovascular fitness]] in healthy adults ages 18–45 but greater improvements in VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max were seen in those participating in the HIIT exercise regimen.&lt;ref name=Milanovic2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Milanović Z, Sporiš G, Weston M |title=Effectiveness of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIT) and Continuous Endurance Training for VO2max Improvements: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Controlled Trials|journal=Sports Med|volume=45|issue=10|pages=1469–81|date=October 2015|pmid=26243014|doi=10.1007/s40279-015-0365-0|type=Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another analysis also found that HIIT regimens of one month or longer effectively improve cardiovascular fitness in adolescents and lead to moderate improvements in body composition.&lt;ref name=Costigan2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Costigan SA, Eather N, Plotnikoff RC, Taaffe DR, Lubans DR |title=High-intensity interval training for improving health-related fitness in adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Br J Sports Med|volume=49|issue=19|pages=1253–61|date=October 2015|pmid=26089322|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2014-094490|type=Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a separate systematic review and meta-analysis of seven small randomized controlled trials found that HIIT (defined as four intervals of four minutes at 85–95% of max heart rate with three-minute intervals at 60–70% of max heart rate) was more effective than moderate-intensity continuous training at improving blood vessel function and markers of blood vessel health.&lt;ref name=Ramos2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ramos JS, Dalleck LC, Tjonna AE, Beetham KS, Coombes JS |title=The impact of high-intensity interval training versus moderate-intensity continuous training on vascular function: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Sports Med|volume=45|issue=5|pages=679–92|date=May 2015|pmid=25771785|doi=10.1007/s40279-015-0321-z|type=Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cardiovascular disease====
A 2015 meta-analysis comparing HIIT to moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) in people with [[coronary artery disease]] found that HIIT leads to greater improvements in VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max but that MICT leads to greater reductions in body weight and heart rate.&lt;ref name=Liou2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liou K, Ho S, Fildes J, Ooi SY |title=High Intensity Interval versus Moderate Intensity Continuous Training in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease: A Meta-analysis of Physiological and Clinical Parameters|journal=Heart Lung Circ|volume=25|issue=15|pages=01269-X|date=July 2015|pmid=26375499|doi=10.1016/j.hlc.2015.06.828|type=Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2014 meta-analysis found that the [[cardiorespiratory fitness]], as measured by VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max, of individuals with lifestyle-induced chronic cardiovascular or metabolic diseases (including [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], obesity, [[heart failure]], coronary artery disease, or [[metabolic syndrome]]) who completed a HIIT exercise program was nearly double that of individuals who completed a MICT exercise program.&lt;ref name=Weston2014&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Weston KS, Wisloff U, Coombes JS |title=High-intensity interval training in patients with lifestyle-induced cardiometabolic disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Br J Sports Med|volume=48|issue=16|pages=1227–1234|date=August 2014|pmid=24144531|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2013-092576|type=Systematic Review &amp; Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a study published out of Arizona State in 2018 found that, "''HIIE protocols performed ∼18 h before ingestion of a high-energy fast food meal attenuated but did not entirely eliminate postprandial endothelial dysfunction in young men largely by improving fasting endothelial function."''

The study found that seven sessions of HIIT over a 2-week period improved whole body fat oxidation and the capacity for skeletal muscle to oxidize fat in moderately active women. A 2010 systematic review of HIIT summarized the results of HIIT on fat loss and stated that HIIT can result in modest reductions of subcutaneous fat in young and healthy individuals, but greater reductions for overweight individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boutcher|first=Stephen H.|date=2011|title=High-Intensity Intermittent Exercise and Fat Loss|journal=Journal of Obesity|volume=2011|doi=10.1155/2011/868305|issn=2090-0708|pmc=2991639|pmid=21113312|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study examined the effect of HIIT on cognitive performance among a group of children (N=318).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moreau D, Kirk IJ, Waldie, KE | title = High-intensity training enhances executive function in children in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial | journal = eLife | volume = 6:e25062 | issue = | page = | year = 2017 | pmid = 28825973 | pmc = 5566451| doi = 10.7554/eLife.25062 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors show that HIIT is beneficial to cognitive control and working memory capacity when compared against "a blend of board games, computer games, and trivia quizzes" and that this effect is mediated by the [[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]] polymorphism. They conclude that the study "suggests a promising alternative to enhance cognition, via short and potent exercise regimens".

As of November 2014, the monument carries the names of [[Tanikaze Kajinosuke|Tanikaze]] (63 consecutive wins), [[Umegatani Tōtarō I|Umegatani]] (58), [[Tachiyama Mineemon|Tachiyama]] (56), [[Futabayama Sadaji|Futabayama]] (69), [[Chiyonofuji Mitsugu|Chiyonofuji]] (53) and '''[[Hakuhō Shō|Hakuhō]]''' (63).]]
This is a list of records held by wrestlers of professional [[sumo]]. Only performances in official tournaments or ''[[honbasho]]'' are included here. Since 1958 six ''honbasho'' have been held every year, giving wrestlers from the modern era more opportunities to accumulate championships and wins. Before this, tournaments were held less frequently; sometimes only once or twice per year. 

Names in '''bold''' indicate a still active wrestler. The tables are up to date as of the end of the September 2018 tournament.
&lt;!-- Please do not update while tournament is in progress! --&gt;

This table lists wrestlers with the most championships achieved without a single loss, which is known as a ''[[zenshō-yūshō]].'' Tournaments have been consistently fifteen days long since May 1949. Before that date there were a number of different lengths, including ten, eleven, twelve, and thirteen days. The records of Tachiyama, Tochigiyama and Tsunenohana also include some draws, holds and rest days.

&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; Four of these titles were ''[[zenshō-yūshō]]'' (undefeated championships) and were part of Hakuhō's second-place streak of 63 consecutive wins.&lt;br/&gt;

===Modern era===
In 1927, Tokyo sumo merged with Osaka sumo and most of the sumo systems were changed, so any pre-1927 records are disregarded. The list excludes active wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;Losses by default are excluded, but wins by default are included; as is standard in sumo records.&lt;/ref&gt; Among active wrestlers, at the end of the September 2018 tournament, [[Hakuhō]] had 1001 wins against 180 losses, giving a ratio of 84.8%.

'''Lucozade''' is a [[soft drink]] manufactured by the Japanese company [[Suntory]] and marketed as a range of [[sports drink|sports]] and energy drinks.

A [[glucose]]–water solution, the product was sold until 1983 as a [[carbonated]], slightly orange-flavoured drink in a glass bottle wrapped in yellow [[cellophane]].&lt;ref name=Blythe&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blythe|first1=Jim|title=Consumer Behaviour|date=2013|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781446290323|page=404|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2W5EAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA404|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacists sold it, children were given it when ill, and hospital visitors would regularly arrive with a bottle.&lt;ref name=Delingpole&gt;Delingpole, James (6 May 2017).

"[Dr Johnson suspected that Egg had] picked up a bug of some sort. He said she needed plenty to drink, and suggested Lucozade. Suddenly I wished I was sick as well, because my friendship with Estie had given me a taste for Lucozade: the smell, the bright orange colour, the cellophane wrapping (which could later be used to make X-ray specs), the glugging as it left the bottle like a fizzy golden waterfall, the tiny bubbles jumping out of the glass and popping in the air."&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Almas (2011).

In 1989 the Beecham Group merged to form SmithKline Beecham, which in 2000 merged to form [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. In September 2013 GlaxoSmithKline sold Lucozade and another soft drink, [[Ribena]], to the Japanese conglomerate Suntory for £1.35 billion.&lt;ref name=Monaghan&gt;Monaghan, Angela.

== History ==
"Glucozade" was invented by William Walker Hunter in 1927 in [[Newcastle-Upon-Tyne|Newcastle]]; Hunter had taken over the business of pharmacist William Owen.&lt;ref name=Northern&gt;{{cite news|title=We did it first|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/business/news/10317055.We_did_it_first/|work=The Northern Echo|date=27 March 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CTD&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Trademarks Details 0173483|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/viewTrademark.html?id=0173483&amp;lang=eng|publisher=Canadian Trademarks Database|accessdate=11 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hunter sold the product to [[Beecham Group]] in 1938 and it was eventually renamed to Lucozade.&lt;ref name=Northern/&gt;

In 1953, a factory for the production of Lucozade products was opened in [[Brentford]], which, until 2004, had an iconic sign seen on the side of the [[M4 motorway]] (now in [[Gunnersbury Park]] Museum).&lt;ref name=sign&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3612090.stm|title=Lucozade sign on M4 at GSK's HQ in Brentford removed in 2004|publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=30 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lucozade originally was available in only one variety, which was effervescent with a distinctive sweet citric flavour. It was sold in a glass bottle with a yellow cellophane wrap until 1983, when Lucozade was rebranded as an energy drink to shift the brand's associations away from illness. The slogan "Lucozade aids recovery" was replaced by "Lucozade replaces lost energy". The glass bottle was replaced by a plastic ([[polyethylene terephthalate]], PET) one. After the rebranding, between 1984 and 1989 UK sales tripled to almost £75 million.

In 1989 the Beecham Group and SmithKline Beckman merged to form SmithKline Beecham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: SmithKline Beecham|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/606830.stm|work=BBC|date=18 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000 SmithKline Beecham and GlaxoWellcome merged to form [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Glaxo SmithKline merger|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/607187.stm|work=BBC News|date=17 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 GSK put Ribena and Lucozade up for sale.&lt;ref name="Neate"&gt;{{cite news |author=Rupert Neate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/24/lucozade-ribena-sale-glaxosmithkline-gsk |title=Lucozade and Ribena up for sale |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 April 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suntory]], a Japanese holding company, bought the brands in September for £1.35 billion.&lt;ref name=Monaghan/&gt;   At the time of the sale, the product was manufactured in England at the Royal Forest Factory in [[Coleford, Gloucestershire|Coleford]], [[Gloucestershire]], in the [[Forest of Dean]].&lt;ref name=Monaghan/&gt;

==Purpose and effectiveness==
A stated purpose of sports drinks, which provide many [[calorie]]s of energy from sugars, is to improve performance and endurance. In an analysis by Matthew Thompson and colleagues from the Oxford Centre for [[Evidence Based Medicine]], of 431 marketing claims of performance enhancement, most cited no evidence. 174 sources were cited for Lucozade; of them, Thompson found only three studies of high quality with a low risk of bias. The rigorous studies that did show improved endurance were "of limited relevance to most people because the tests were on elite athletes". Thompson said that for the vast majority of people drinking such products "could completely counteract exercising more, playing football more, going to the gym more".&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Stephen |title=Sugar-laden sports drinks cancel out exercise gain |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9408844/Sugar-laden-sports-drinks-cancel-out-exercise-gain.html |accessdate=16 September 2015 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heneghan|first1=C|last2=Perera|first2=R|last3=Nunan|first3=D|last4=Mahtani|first4=K|last5=Gill|first5=P|title=Forty years of sports performance research and little insight gained.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=18 July 2012|volume=345|pages=e4797|pmid=22810388|doi=10.1136/bmj.e4797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drinks are marketed as [[soft drink]]s; a soft drinks industry spokesman said in response "By helping people participating in sport to perform better and to recover more quickly, sports drinks can encourage people to exercise more".&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

In May 2016, [[Liverpool City Council]] started a campaign against so-called "[[Junk food|sugary drinks]]". The "name and shame" campaign, entitled “Is your child’s sweet tooth harming their health?”, claimed that Lucozade was the worst offender, containing 62 grams of sugar in a 500 ml bottle, followed by [[Coca-Cola]] with 54 grams. Posters for the campaign "were displayed in doctors' surgeries and hospitals."&lt;ref name=Campbell7May2016&gt;{{cite news|author=Denis Campbell | title=Liverpool in drive to name and shame fizzy drink brands|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/07/liverpool-fizzy-drink-brands-sugar-obesity|work=The Guardian|date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original high sugar content formulation Lucozade was recommended by UK diabetes charities as an immediate treatment for [[hypoglycemia]] in individuals who take [[insulin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hypoglycaemia (hypos)|url=http://www.londondiabetes.nhs.uk/about-diabetes/hypoglycaemia.aspx|accessdate=8 May 2016|publisher=Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College NHS Foundation Trust |date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diabetes.co.uk/blog/2017/03/how-will-decreased-sugar-in-lucozade-affect-people-with-diabetes/|title=How will decreased sugar in Lucozade affect people with diabetes?|access-date=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its change to use of artificial sweeteners guidelines have been changed to state that Lucozade should not be used to treat diabetic hypos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diabetestimes.co.uk/new-edition-hospital-hypos-guideline-published/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
While the ingredients vary somewhat from one drink to another, the ingredients of the Lucozade Original Energy, were listed as follows in 2013: [[carbonated water]], [[glucose]] syrup (25%), [[citric acid]] (E330), [[lactic acid]] (E270), [[flavouring]] (unspecified), [[preservative]]s ([[potassium sorbate]], [[sodium bisulphite]] (E-222)), [[caffeine]], [[antioxidant]] ([[ascorbic acid]]), colour ([[sunset yellow]] (E110), [[Ponceau 4R]]). Since the reformulation to lower sugar in 2017 Lucozade Original contains the artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame K.

A warning is printed on the packaging that the colouring may have an [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|adverse effect on activity and attention]] in children. Nutritional information for 380&amp;nbsp;ml bottle: [[Food energy|energy]] 1129&amp;nbsp;k[[joule]]s = 266&amp;nbsp;[[kCal]]; [[protein]], [[fat]] and [[Dietary fibre|fibre]] nil; [[carbohydrates]] 65.4&amp;nbsp;g of which [[sugar]]s 33.1&amp;nbsp;g of which 65.4&amp;nbsp;g glucose-based; and [[sodium]] trace.&lt;ref name=label&gt;Packaging of Lucozade Energy Original, 2013. Package printed with number 0502229/02&lt;/ref&gt; Packaging also warns that spilt Lucozade may stain. A 380 ml bottle of Lucozade contains 46&amp;nbsp;mg of caffeine,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lucozade.com/contact/ Lucozade.com]&lt;/ref&gt; about as much as a cup of tea.

Lucozade contains 0.01% [[ethanol]] (alcohol), which kept observant [[Muslim]]s from being allowed to drink it ([[Islamic dietary laws#Intoxicants|Islam bans alcohol]]) until, in 2004, the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] ruled that they saw no harm in consuming Lucozade which contains traces of ethyl alcohol that does not bear its original qualities and does not change the taste, colour or smell. GlaxoSmithKline pointed out that fruit juices and bread could also contain the same or higher trace amounts of alcohol due to natural [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3527724.stm|title=Muslims get soft drinks go-ahead|publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=2 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorships==

The '''Major League of [[Monster Trucks]]''' was an organization which promoted and sanctioned monster truck events in the [[United States]].  It produced events at venues on the west coast and at various [[Speedway Motorsports]] owned tracks.  While still featuring [[Freestyle (monster trucks)|freestyle]], the organization placed a distinct emphasis on racing and hoped to hold an open qualifying based points series, versus the current invite-only structure that is used in Monster Jam.

The racing layouts are very similar to Crossover races that are run overseas in Europe. More specifically, the MLMT tracks are comparable to the layouts seen at the annual Race of Champions festival, but adapted for off-road racing.

MLMT concentrated largely on competitive Motorsport action and racing whereas its more popular competitor, Monster Jam, largely concentrates on a more [[Sports Entertainment]] style of Monster Truck competition with less racing and more entertaining competitions.

The live events were hosted by [[Chuck Plumlee]] and [[Chad Nicholson]].

The series however went bankrupt and closed its doors. Their last show was held in 2009 in Red Bluff, CA.

== Company history ==
In 2010, PlaySight was founded in [[Kfar Saba]], Israel, using technology with roots in the Israeli military.&lt;ref name=Boom&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniel|first1=Kaplan|title=Smart court maker PlaySight helps push boom in tennis tech|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/11/30/Research-and-Ratings/Company-Watch.aspx |publisher=SportsBusiness Journal|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After years developing weaponry and war simulators for the Israeli army and other defense clients, the three partners looked to apply their skills and knowledge to a new challenge. After one of the partners, Evgeni Khazanov, observed his daughter’s tennis practice, he wondered why a sport with so much money did not have any advanced technology to help players improve their game. It was from that idea that PlaySight was born. 

PlaySight has continued to grow through partnerships and investment from players in the tennis industry including [[Billie Jean King]], [[Ana Ivanovic]], [[Chris Evert]], [[Pete Sampras]], [[Novak Djokovic]], [[Tommy Haas]], [[Paul Annacone]], and [[Darren Cahill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTA Grand Slam Singles Champion and Former World #1 Ana Ivanovic Joins the PlaySight Team|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wta-grand-slam-singles-champion-143000759.html|website=Yahoo Finance|publisher=PRNewswire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable investors include Bill Ackman, Mark Ein, Dr. James Loehr, Gordon Uehling III, and George Mackin. Since the technology was commercialized in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Colleen|title=High-tech training tool sets new standard on courts at Alberta Tennis Centre|url=http://calgary.ctvnews.ca/high-tech-training-tool-sets-new-standard-on-courts-at-alberta-tennis-centre-1.3356496|website=CTV News Calgary|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the technology has been adapted for numerous other sports including soccer, martial arts, volleyball, squash, handball, gymnastics, dancing, hockey and wrestling. So far, PlaySight has raised over $20 million and now has offices in Kfar Saba, New Jersey and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rubin|first1=Eliran|title=The Israeli Startups Leading the Digital Sports Revolution|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/1.776328|website=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, [[Verizon]] Ventures and golfer [[Greg Norman]] announced an $11 million investment in PlaySight to further SmartCourt expansion in tennis, basketball and other sports and to also introduce the technology to golf.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellerossingh/2017/06/02/greg-norman-verizon-ventures-invest-11m-in-developing-smart-golf-course/#7175a5196a00&lt;/ref&gt;

PlaySight installed its first SmartSchools in 2017 – fully wired high school campuses (including [[Trinity-Pawling School]], [[Oaks Christian School]] and [[Sierra Canyon School]] with PlaySight across several sports – basketball, ice hockey, soccer and more.&lt;ref name=School&gt;{{cite web|url= https://frntofficesport.com/playsight-goes-back-to-school/ |title=PlaySight Goes Back to School |work=Front Office Sports |date=2017-08-23 |accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method of operation ==
A PlaySight "SmartCourt" is a system of fully automated HD cameras that record, stream and analyze all on-court action.&lt;ref name=SecretWeapon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/southern-courier/sport/feel-like-a-star-with-hitech-tennis-court/news-story/98c3281c7cf9a907473c785103ac3dcd&lt;/ref&gt;For tennis, the technology uses image processing and analytical algorithms to track strokes, ball trajectory, player movement and shot speed and spin.&lt;ref name=Boom /&gt; PlaySight's SmartCourt system provides players and coaches instant multi-angle video and detailed statistics through the court side kiosk and on tablets and mobile devices.&lt;ref name=Eyes /&gt; Their cloud-based platform allows teams to live stream matches and stores all video from SmartCourt sessions for coaches and players to review later from any web enabled device.&lt;ref name=WhatIsPlaysight /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.verizonventures.com/blog/2017/06/entrepreneur-spotlight-chen-shachar,-founder-ceo-of-playsight/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, PlaySight unveiled its SmartField technology for soccer&lt;ref name=Booton&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sporttechie.com/playsight-expands-4k-video-instant-replays-soccer/ |title=PlaySight Expands 4K Training Video, Instant Replays To Soccer |last=Booton |first=Jen |date=2017-10-25 |work=SportTechie |accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also released its SmartTracker technology - an autonomous 4K camera that follows all on-court action automatically.&lt;ref name=School /&gt;

== PlayFair challenge system for tennis ==
Cheating has become a prominent issue in tennis particularly on junior circuits where players call their own lines.&lt;ref name=Cheat&gt;{{cite web|last1=Danielle|first1=Rossingh|title=Is This The End For The Tennis Club Cheat?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellerossingh/2016/10/31/is-this-the-end-for-the-tennis-club-cheat/#6f93e77a3803|website=Forbes|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SecretWeapon /&gt; PlaySight developed the idea of PlayFair Tournaments that use the line-calling feature of PlaySight's SmartCourt technology to tackle the cheating problem in tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pantic|first1=Nina|title=PLAYFAIR TOURNAMENTS ARE DETERRING CHEATING, EMPHASIZING SPORTSMANSHIP|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2016/12/playfair-tournaments-are-deterring-cheating-emphasizing-sportsmanship/62436/|website=Tennis Magazine|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tournaments allow players to challenge close line calls and use the PlaySight court side kiosk to access video replay to confirm or overrule the call.&lt;ref name=Cheat /&gt; PlayFair Tournaments have been organized at both the junior club and collegiate levels.'

In late 2017, PlaySight and the ITA announced an expansion of the PlayFair initiative, bringing the technology to close to 30 NCAA dual matches for the 2018 season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itatennis.com/AboutITA/News/Intercollegiate_Tennis_Association_And_PlaySight_Expand_PlayFair_Challenge_System_Pilot_Tests.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion into new sports ==
PlaySight expanded into basketball, volleyball, soccer, and several other sports in 2017.&lt;ref name=Booton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sporttechie.com/playsight-brings-its-smartcourts-to-the-high-school-level/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RE/MAX Field''' (formerly '''Edmonton Ballpark''', and '''Telus Field''' stylized as TELUS) is a [[baseball stadium]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada. It has served as home to several [[minor league baseball]] clubs, currently the [[Edmonton Prospects]] of the [[Western Major Baseball League]]; its last affiliated tenant was the [[Edmonton Trappers]], a AAA [[Pacific Coast League]] club, and its most recent tenant was the [[Edmonton Capitals]], an independent team that has been inactive since 2011. In 2016 the Prospects were granted naming rights to the facility as the old name had expired. The facility is located in the [[North Saskatchewan River valley parks system|North Saskatchewan River Valley]], in the neighbourhood of [[Rossdale, Edmonton|Rossdale]].

==History==
[[File:Telus Field.jpg|thumb|250px|Telus Field in 2010]]
Opened in 1995, Telus Field replaced the 60-year-old [[John Ducey Park]] (formerly ''Renfrew Park'') on the same site. The stadium's [[naming rights]] were purchased by the [[Telus]] [[telecommunications]] company in September 1995 for a 14-year deal.&lt;ref name="Edmonton Journal"&gt;{{cite news

==Features==
RE/MAX Field uses natural grass in the outfield and [[FieldTurf]] in the infield; originally [[AstroTurf]] was used but it was replaced in 2005 with the more modern type of turf, FieldTurf. Artificial turf was chosen for lower maintenance costs, because it allows for a better drainage system so the infield can return to a playable state quicker than a grass infield would, and to minimize damage to the infield when concerts are held at the stadium.

The park has ground-level luxury suites with box and general seating built on top. The Home Plate VIP Lounge on the main concourse is located directly behind the plate, incorporating a bar and a restaurant with a view of the field from seats inside and outside.&lt;ref name=ticketmaster/&gt; The lounge includes trophies and pictures of early Edmonton baseball teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nlfan.com/edmonton/homePlateClub.shtml |title=Home Plate Club/Lounge |publisher=nlfan.com |access-date=June 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014204036/http://nlfan.com/edmonton/homePlateClub.shtml |archive-date=October 14, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity of the stadium is 9,200.&lt;ref name="Capacity"/&gt;

The dimensions are {{convert|340|ft|m}} to left field, {{convert|378|ft|m}} to left centre, {{convert|420|ft|m}} to centre field, {{convert|395|ft|m}} to right centre and {{convert|320|ft|m}} to right field.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The stadium concourse features pictures of historic moments in Trapper history, including [[Ron Kittle]]'s 50-home-run season. There are also pictures from every Trapper championship and trophies.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==About==
'''Ralph F. DellaCamera Stadium''' is a sport stadium in [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]], [[Connecticut]].  The facility is primarily used by the [[University of New Haven]] athletic teams, as well as the University of New Haven Chargers Marching Band.&lt;ref name="Tom McMahon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tommcmahon.net/2008/11/another-blue-football-field-ralph-f-dellacamera-stadium-at-the-university-of-new-haven.html|publisher=Tom McMahon.net|title=Another Blue Football Field: Ralph F. DellaCamera Stadium at the University of New Haven|date=November 19, 2008|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field turf is not the normal selection of green, but is instead blue.  The selection of blue—a non-traditional field color—was made to generate excitement and publicity while the school was re-establishing its college football program.&lt;ref name="Tom McMahon" /&gt;   As of the 2012 season, New Haven is only one of five college programs to have the field color other than the traditional green&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindenwood.edu/news/2012/885-BV.html|publisher=[[Lindenwood University]]|accessdate=September 7, 2012|title=Lindenwood Stadium Nearing Final Stages of Renovations|date=July 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911043931/http://www.lindenwood.edu/news/2012/885-BV.html|archivedate=September 11, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[college football]] game played at the stadium was a 25&amp;ndash;18 loss to the [[Bentley University|Bentley University Falcons]] on September 26, 2009.

The stadium is also used for local high school sporting events and other community events.

==Non-Athletic Uses==
The [[University of New Haven]] used DellaCamera Stadium for its Spring Commencement until May 2011, where the University moved the ceremony to the [[Oakdale Theatre]].

The book begins with retired [[England national football team|England]] [[Striker (association football)|striker]] Andy Blair who has recently moved to the town of Scorton watching the local team struggle in a [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] match. After the game he is approached by club chairman Herbert Graydon who convinces him to come out of retirement and play for Rovers. As the story progresses Andy, whose performances begin to lift Rovers up the table, introduces his eighteen-year-old son Bobbie into the team. Bobbie, despite playing well, becomes mixed up with some local match-fixers and experiences some difficulties in his relationship with his girlfriend Adrienne who he follows to [[Bristol]] on the eve of a big game to try to resolve their problems. Andy feels forced to take matters into his own hand and tackles the match-fixers himself before retrieving his son. At the novel's conclusion the Blairs are reunited and can finally concentrate on trying to ensure Rovers win promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Hardcastle, Michael ''Soccer Comes First'' (London: Heinemann, 1966, {{ISBN|0-330-25810-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TD Arena''' is a 5,100 seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], [[United States]] that opened in 2008 and replaced [[John Kresse Arena]] as the home of the [[College of Charleston]] [[College of Charleston Cougars|Cougars]] [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] teams.  The South Financial Group of [[Greenville, South Carolina]], purchased the naming rights to the new facility and it opened in 2008 under the Carolina First Arena name.  After the 2010 sale of the corporation to [[Toronto Dominion Bank]], the arena's name changed to TD Arena.  The playing surface is named John Kresse Court in honor of legendary Charleston men's basketball coach [[John Kresse]].

Originally to be named Carolina First Center, the facility was renamed Carolina First Arena to avoid confusion with the bank's south coast main offices in Charleston which are located in an office building by the same name.

The first game played at the arena on November 14, 2008 was a first round game of the inaugural ESPN [[Charleston Classic]] between [[Texas Christian University]] and [[Western Michigan University]] won by TCU 67-63.

Perhaps the biggest game in arena history was an 82-79 Charleston victory in overtime over then-No. 9 ranked and defending national champion North Carolina on January 4, 2010.

The arena not only plays host to Cougars' basketball games, but it also hosts many other campus events, including orientations, campus tours, award ceremonies, and external events (including concerts for Hootie &amp; Spoleto Festival). The TD Arena is overseen by Josh Bryson, Director of Operations. He is assisted by Kelsea McGrogan, Assistant Director of Operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cofcsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=714703&amp;DB_OEM_ID=14800&amp;DB_OEM_ID=14800|title=College of Charleston Athletics Staff Directory - CofCSports.com--Official Web site of College of Charleston Athletics|website=www.cofcsports.com|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bad News Bears''''' is a 1976 American [[sports film|sports]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]]. It stars [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Tatum O'Neal]]. The film was followed by two sequels, ''[[The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training]]'' in 1977 and ''[[The Bad News Bears Go to Japan]]'' in 1978, a short-lived 1979–80 [[CBS]] [[The Bad News Bears (TV series)|television series]], and a 2005 [[Bad News Bears|remake]].

The original screenplay was written by [[Bill Lancaster]]. Notable was the score by [[Jerry Fielding]], which is an adaptation of the principal themes of [[Bizet]]'s opera ''[[Carmen]]''.

==Plot==
Morris Buttermaker, an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] and former minor-league [[baseball]] [[pitcher]], is recruited by Bob Whitewood, a city councilman and attorney who filed a lawsuit against an ultra-competitive Southern California Youth Baseball League which excluded the least skilled athletes (including his son) from playing. In order to settle the lawsuit, the league agrees to add an additional team - the Bears - which is composed of the worst players. Buttermaker becomes the coach of the unlikely team, which includes (among others) a near-sighted pitcher, an overweight catcher, a foulmouthed shortstop with a [[Napoleon complex]], an outfielder who dreams of emulating his idol [[Hank Aaron]], two non-English-speaking Mexican immigrants, a withdrawn and bullied boy named Timmy Lupus, and a motley collection of other "talent". Shunned by the more competitive teams (and competitive parents), the Bears are the outsiders. They play their opening game, and do not even record an out, giving up 26 runs before Buttermaker [[wikt:forfeit|forfeit]]s the game.

Realizing the team is nearly hopeless, he recruits a couple of unlikely prospects: sharp-tongued Amanda Whurlizer, a skilled pitcher (trained by Buttermaker when she was younger) who is the 12-year-old daughter of one of Buttermaker's ex-girlfriends. At first, she tries to convince Buttermaker that she has given up baseball, but then she reveals that she had been practicing "on the sly".  Before agreeing to join the team, Amanda makes a number of outlandish demands (such as imported jeans, modeling school, ballet lessons, etc.) as conditions for joining.  Upon hearing her demands, Buttermaker asks, "Who do you think you are, [[Catfish Hunter]]?"  Amanda responds by asking, "Who's he?"  Rounding out the team, Buttermaker recruits the "best athlete in the area," who also happens to be the local cigarette-smoking, loan-sharking, [[Harley-Davidson]]-riding troublemaker, Kelly Leak. With Whurlizer and Leak on board, the team starts gaining more confidence, and the Bears start winning games.

Eventually, the unlikely Bears make it to the championship game opposite the top-notch Yankees, who are coached by aggressive, competitive Roy Turner.  As the game progresses, tensions are ratcheted up as Buttermaker and Turner engage in shouting matches, directing their players to become increasingly more ruthless and competitive against each other, going as far as fighting, spiking on slide, or the batter getting hit on purpose.

The turnaround point of the game comes after a heated exchange between Turner's son (and Yankees pitcher) Joey and the Bears at-bat catcher Engelberg. Turner orders his son to walk Engelberg, the only Bears hitter he cannot overcome, despite Joey's wish to give it a try. In response, Joey intentionally throws a wild [[beanball]] nearly striking Engelberg in the head. Horrified, Turner goes to the mound and slaps his son. On the next pitch, Engelberg hits a routine ground ball back to Joey who exacts revenge against his father by holding the ball until Engelberg has an inside the park home run.  Joey then leaves the game dropping the ball at his father's feet.

Buttermaker, realizing that he has become as competitive as Turner, puts the benchwarmers on the field, thus giving everyone a chance to play. In spite of this, the finish-up brings up the best team-play from the Bears. After loading the bases with smart tactics (two walks and a bunt) they nearly recover a four run difference, with the last runner getting taken out at the last moment.

After having narrowly lost the game 7 to 6, Buttermaker gives the team free rein of his beer cooler. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of having come a long way. The condescending Yankees congratulate the Bears telling them that although they are still not that good, they have "guts."  Tanner, the shortstop, replies by telling the Yankees where they can put their trophy. The Bears cheer and Timmy Lupus overcomes his chronic shyness enough to yell "Wait 'til next year!", then they spray their beers all over each other. The movie ends with a field celebration that makes it look as if they won the game.

{{Anchor|Reception|Reaction}}

==Reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 97% based on reviews from 30 critics and an average rating of 7.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Bad News Bears'' is rude, profane, and cynical, but shot through with honest, unforced humor, and held together by a deft, understated performance from Walter Matthau."&lt;ref&gt;{{Rotten Tomatoes|1001567_bad_news_bears|THE BAD NEWS BEARS (1976)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1976 review, critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four and called it "an unblinking, scathing look at competition in American society".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19760413/REVIEWS/604130301/1023 Review, ''The Bad News Bears''], ''Chicago Sun-Times'', April 13, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] awarded two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling the film's characters "more types than people" and the kids' foul-mouth dialogue "overdone," though he found O'Neal's performance "genuinely affecting."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (April 14, 1976). "'Bad News Bears' takes a swing at Little League". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 3, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "the funniest adult-child comedy film since '[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'," and lauded the "excellent" script.&lt;ref&gt;"Film Reviews: The Bad News Bears". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. April 7, 1976. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' declared it "the best American screen comedy of the year to date," adding, "Bright, pugnacious and utterly realistic as most children seem to be today, these kids are drawn with much accuracy and are played beautifully."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Thomas, Kevin]] (April 7, 1976). "Matthau, O'Neal Throw Strikes". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 1, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found the film only "occasionally funny" but praised screenwriter Bill Lancaster for "the talent and discipline to tell the story of 'The Bad News Bears' almost completely in terms of what happens on the baseball diamond or in the dugout."&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Canby|Canby, Vincent]] (April 7, 1976). "At Bat With Matthau and O'Neal in 'Bad News Bears'". ''[[The New York Times]]''. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised it as "a lively, spontaneously funny entertainment" that "could rally a large parallel audience seeking less innocuous and stereotyped pictures with and about children."&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Gary (April 8, 1976). "A hit for 'The Bad News Bears'". ''[[The Washington Post]]''. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Milne]] of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' called it "miraculously funny and entirely delightful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milne |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Milne |date=November 1976 |title=The Bad News Bears |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=43 |issue=514 |page=228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}

===Awards===
Walter Matthau was nominated for a [[BAFTA]] award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy. The screenplay by [[Bill Lancaster]], son of actor [[Burt Lancaster]], was winner of a Writers Guild of America award.

''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' did a [[parody]] of the film with Matthau as the guest host called ''The Bad News Bees'' with [[John Belushi]], [[Dan Aykroyd]] and the rest in their recurring bee costumes for what would be their final time. This subtly referenced masturbation which was alluded to as "buzzing-off".

[[Image:Wheelchair basketball 090923 akita cropped.jpg|thumb|250px|Wheelchair basketball game]]
'''Wheelchair basketball''' is [[basketball]] played by people with varying physical disabilities that disqualify them from playing an able-bodied sport. These include spina bifida, birth defects, cerebral palsy, paralysis due to accident, amputations (of the legs, or other parts), and many other disabilities. The [[International Wheelchair Basketball Federation]] (IWBF) is the governing body for this sport. It is recognized by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) as the sole competent authority in wheelchair basketball worldwide. [[FIBA]] has recognized IWBF under Article 53 of its General Statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wheelchair basketball|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=16&amp;sid=65a0aa55-5589-480f-bab1-6fc7b0ed7255%40sessionmgr111&amp;hid=103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=lalu.3277431&amp;db=cat00252a|website=Capstone|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWBF has 82 National Organizations for Wheelchair Basketball (NOWBs) participating in wheelchair basketball throughout the world, with this number increasing each year. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people play wheelchair basketball from recreation to club play and as elite national team members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwbf.org/game/game_01.html Estimates of number of players according to the IWBF website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216074346/http://www.iwbf.org/game/game_01.html |date=2008-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheelchair basketball is played by boys, girls, men and women.

Wheelchair basketball is included in the [[Paralympic Games]]. The [[Wheelchair Basketball World Championship]] is played two years after every Paralympic Games. Major competition in wheelchair basketball comes from [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Japan]].

==History==

===1940s to 1960s===

In 1944, [[Ludwig Guttmann]], through the rehabilitation program at the [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]], in [[Aylesbury]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]], adapted existing sports to use [[wheelchair]]s. It was known as [[wheelchair netball]].

At around the same times, starting from 1946, wheelchair basketball games were played primarily between [[United States|American]] [[World War II]] disabled veterans. This began in the United States at the University of Illinois. Dr. Timothy Nugent founded the National Wheelchair Basketball Association in 1949 and served as commissioner for the first twenty-five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.library.illinois.edu/archon/?p=creators/creator&amp;id=2347|title=Nugent, Timothy J. (1923-) {{!}} University of Illinois Archives|website=archives.library.illinois.edu|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Games]], held in 1947, were the first games to be held and included only a handful of participants (26), and few events (shot put, javelin, club throw, and archery).

The number of wheelchair events and participants grew quickly. Wheelchair [[netball]] was introduced in the 1948 Games. In 1952, a team from the Netherlands was invited to compete with the British team. This became the first International Stoke-Mandeville Games ([[ISMG]]), an event that has been held annually ever since.

Wheelchair basketball, as we know it now, was first played at the 1956 International Stoke-Mandeville Games.

In 1973, the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation ([[ISMGF]]) established the first sub-section for wheelchair basketball. At that time ISMGF was the world governing body for all wheelchair sports.

In 1989 ISMGF accepted for its former wheelchair basketball sub-section to be named [[International Wheelchair Basketball Federation]] (IWBF).

Full independence came in 1993 with the [[International Wheelchair Basketball Federation|IWBF]] becoming the world body for wheelchair basketball with full responsibility for development of the sport. Over the following years IWBF membership grew in size and based on the number of National Organizations for Wheelchair Basketball (NOWBs) with active programs, the international federation configured itself into four geographical zones: Africa, Americas, Asia/Oceania and Europe.

===Wheelchair Basketball World Championship===
{{Main article|Wheelchair Basketball World Championship}}
{{Update|date=September 2015}}
World championships for the sport have been held since 1973, with [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]] being the first host city. The first world championship for men was won by [[Great Britain]]. Of the first 11 men's world championships, six were  won by the [[United States]] (1979, 1983, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002); and once each by Great Britain (the first ever championship in 1973), Israel (1975), France (1990), Canada (2006) and Australia (2010). Canada has won four of the women's world championship titles (1994, 1998, 2002, 2006), and the United States two (1990, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fontaine|first1=Pamela|title=Wheelchair basketball|date=2000|publisher=66 leaves|location=Boston|pages=20|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

Wheelchair basketball retains most major rules and scoring of basketball, and maintains a 10-foot basketball hoop and standard basketball court. The exceptions are rules which have been modified with consideration for the wheelchair. For example, "travelling" in wheelchair basketball occurs when the athlete touches their wheels more than twice after receiving or dribbling the ball. The individual must pass, bounce or shoot the ball before touching the wheels again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Syzman|first1=Robert|title=Ball Size and Distance|date=January 14, 2014|volume=Consumer health|ref=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=20&amp;sid=65a0aa55-5589-480f-bab1-6fc7b0ed7255%40sessionmgr111&amp;hid=103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=103905524&amp;db=ccm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries such as Canada, Australia and England, non-disabled athletes using wheelchairs are allowed to compete alongside other athletes on mixed teams.

===Classifications===
{{Main article|Wheelchair basketball classification}}
Classification is an international regulation for playing wheelchair basketball to harmonize players' different levels of disabilities. All teams which compete above a recreational level use the classification system to evaluate the functional abilities of players on a point scale of 1 to 4.5. Minimally disabled athletes are classified as a 4.5, and an individual with the highest degree of disability (such as a paraplegic with a complete injury below the chest) would be classified as a 1.0. Competitions restrict the number of points allowable on the court at one time. The five players from each team on the court during play may not exceed a total of 14 points. In places where teams are integrated, non-disabled athletes compete as either a 4.5 in Canada or a 5.0 in Europe; however, non-disabled athletes are not allowed to compete internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Basketball |publisher=International Paralympic Committee |url=http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/IF_Sports/Wheelchair_Basketball/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wheelchair design===
Basketball wheelchairs are designed for enhanced stability. The [[center of gravity]] is where the chair and the athlete's mass are equally distributed in all directions. Points at which the wheelchair can tip over sideways are the fulcrum. A wheelchair with a higher seat is easier to tip. Basketball chairs have lower seats and wheels that are angled outward so that the center of gravity has to move a greater distance before it passes over the fulcrum and tips the chair. Guards use wheelchairs different from those of centers and forwards.  Forwards and centers are typically under the net, their chairs have higher seats and therefore less mobility, but the height increases the player's reach for shots at the hoop and for rebounds. Guards have lower seats and therefore greater stability for ball handling and getting down the court as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science360.gov/obj/video/d6ed8536-61aa-43d9-9822-f2ca072ca718/science-summer-olympics-engineering-mobility "Science of the summer Olympics: engineering for mobility"] Cooper R.
