==Alcohol as a carcinogen and cocarcinogen==
The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (Centre International de Recherche sur le Cancer) of the [[World Health Organization]] has classified alcohol as a [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]], similar to arsenic, benzene and asbestos. Its evaluation states, "There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages in humans. …Alcoholic beverages at any quantity are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alcohol drinking |publisher=[[World Health Organization]], [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] |location=Lyon |year=1988 |isbn=92-832-1244-4 |url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol44/volume44.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HfISAYpQ?url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol44/volume44.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-26 |authors=International Agency for Rescarch on Cancer, World Health Organization.}} p8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==

=== Acetaldehyde ===
[[Acetaldehyde]] is produced by the liver as it breaks down ethanol. The liver then normally eliminates 99% of the acetaldehyde. An average liver can process 7&amp;nbsp;grams of ethanol per hour. For example, it takes 12 hours to eliminate the ethanol in a bottle of wine, giving 12 hours or more of acetaldehyde exposure.
A study of 818 heavy drinkers found that those who are exposed to more acetaldehyde than normal through a defect in the gene for [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] are at greater risk of developing cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract and liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ijc.21583 |vauthors=Homann N, Stickel F, König IR | year = 2006| title = Alcohol dehydrogenase 1C*1 allele is a genetic marker for alcohol-associated cancer in heavy drinkers | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/112141765/HTMLSTART | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 118 | issue = 8| pages = 1998–2002 | pmid=16287084|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are many associations between alcohol drinking and different types of cancer. Data from 2009 indicated 3.5 percent of cancer deaths in the U.S. were due to consumption of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;National Cancer Institute [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/alcohol] 2.What is the evidence that alcohol drinking is a cause of cancer?&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
In a review, Pöschl and Seitz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Pöschl G, Seitz HK |title=Alcohol and cancer |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=155–65 |year=2004 |pmid=15082451 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/agh057}}&lt;/ref&gt; list some possible mechanisms of alcohol as a carcinogen:
* local effects of alcohol
* metabolism to acetaldehyde (which may be [[mutagenic]] at physiologically meaningful levels&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Theruvathu JA, Jaruga P, Nath RG, Dizdaroglu M, Brooks PJ |title=Polyamines stimulate the formation of mutagenic 1,N2-propanodeoxyguanosine adducts from acetaldehyde |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=3513–20 |year=2005 |pmid=15972793 |pmc=1156964 |doi=10.1093/nar/gki661}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* induction of [[CYP2E1]]
* nutritional deficiencies
* interactions with retinoids
* alcohol and methylation
* alcohol and immune surveillance

Purohita ''et al.'' propose an overlapping list:

# depletion of [[S-Adenosyl methionine|S-adenosylmethionine]] and, consequently, induction of global DNA hypomethylation;
# induction of increased production of inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins and components of extracellular signal-regulated kinase–mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling
# accumulation of iron and associated oxidative stress
# inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene [[BRCA1]] and increased estrogen responsiveness (primarily in breast)
# impairment of retinoic acid metabolism.&lt;ref name=Purohita&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Purohit V, Khalsa J, Serrano J |title=Mechanisms of alcohol-associated cancers: introduction and summary of the symposium |journal=Alcohol |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=155–60 |date=April 2005 |pmid=16054976 |doi=10.1016/j.alcohol.2005.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boffetta and Hashibe list plausible mechanisms as including:

Individuals who both smoke and drink are at a much higher risk of developing mouth, tracheal, and esophageal cancer. Research has shown their risk of developing these cancers is 35 times higher than in individuals who neither smoke nor drink. This evidence may suggest that there is a cocarcinogenic interaction between alcohol and tobacco-related carcinogens.&lt;ref name=aa21&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Alcohol and Cancer |url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa21.htm |journal=Alcohol Alert |volume=21 |year=1993 |publisher=[[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Blot WJ, McLaughlin JK, Winn DM |title=Smoking and drinking in relation to oral and pharyngeal cancer |journal=Cancer Research |volume=48 |issue=11 |pages=3282–7 |date=1 June 1988|pmid=3365707 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3365707 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local carcinogenic effect of ethanol===
The risk of cancer associated with alcohol consumption is higher in tissues in closest contact on ingestion of alcohol, such as the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus. This is explained by the fact that ethanol is a proven mutagen and in addition,  metabolite of ethanol (acetaldehyde) produced in the liver is highly carcinogenic, thus explaining both local (mouth, throat, esophageal cancers) as well as distant (skin, liver, breast) cancers. It is well known that ethanol causes cell death at the concentrations present in alcoholic beverages. Few cells survive a one-hour exposure to 5-10% ethanol or a 15-second exposure to 30–40% ethanol in cell culture, where surviving cells might undergo genomic changes leading to carcinogenesis. But recent evidence suggests that the cytotoxic effect of ethanol on the cells lining the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus activates the division of the stem cells located in deeper layers of the mucosa to replace the dead cells. Every time stem cells divide, they become exposed to unavoidable errors associated with cell division (e.g., mutations arising during DNA replication and chromosomal alterations occurring during mitosis) and also become highly vulnerable to the genotoxic activity of DNA-damaging agents (e.g., acetaldehyde and tobacco carcinogens). Alcohol consumption probably increases the risk of developing cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus by promoting the accumulation of cell divisions in the stem cells that maintain these tissues in homeostasis. Because the cytotoxic activity of ethanol is concentration-dependent, the risk of these cancers will not only increase with increasing amounts of ethanol, but also with increasing concentrations; an ounce of whisky is probably more carcinogenic when taken undiluted than when taken mixed with non-alcoholic beverages. The local cytotoxic effect of ethanol may also explain the known synergistic effect of alcohol and tobacco use on the risk of these cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lopez-Lazaro M |url=http://www.oraloncology.com/article/S1368-8375(16)30177-4/abstract |title=A local mechanism by which alcohol consumption causes cancer. |journal=Oral Oncology | date=October 2016 |doi= 10.1016/j.oraloncology.2016.10.001 | pmid=27720397 |volume=62 |pages=149–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several European studies have linked the inherited hepatic [[porphyrias]] with  a predisposition to hepatocellular carcinoma. Typical risk factors for HCC need not be present with the acute hepatic porphyrias, specifically acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria. [[Porphyria cutanea tarda]] is also associated with HCC, but with typical risk factors including evidence of hepatotropic viruses, hemochromatosis and alcoholic cirrhosis. Tyrosinemia Type I, an inherited disorder in tyrosine metabolism impacting the second enzyme in the heme metabolic pathway is associated with a high risk of developing HCC in younger populations, including children.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[Image:Esophageal adenoca.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|Endoscopic]] image of patient with esophageal adenocarcinoma seen at [[gastro-esophageal junction]].]]
Alcohol consumption at any quantity is a risk factor for cancers of the [[oral cancer|mouth]], [[Esophageal cancer|esophagus]], [[pharyngeal cancer|pharynx]] and [[Laryngeal cancer|larynx]]. The U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]] states "Drinking alcohol increases the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, and liver in men and women, … In general, risks increases above baseline with any alcohol intake (mild; &lt;2 glass of wine per week) and increases significantly with moderate alcohol intake (one glass of wine per day) with highest risk in those with greater than 7 glasses of wine per week. (A drink is defined as 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor.) … Also, using alcohol with tobacco is riskier than using either one alone, because it further increases the chances of getting cancers of the mouth, throat, and esophagus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alcohol Consumption |url=http://www.progressreport.cancer.gov |date=December 2007 |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] |work=Cancer Trends Progress Report – 2007 Update |accessdate=29 June 2009}}{{date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 defines moderate alcohol drinking as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. Heavy alcohol drinking is defined as having more than three drinks on any day or more than seven drinks per week for women and more than four drinks on any day or more than 14 drinks per week for men.

The International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) Consortium co-ordinated a meta-study on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Projects: Pooled analysis investigating the effects of beer, wine and liquor consumption on the risk of head and neck cancers |url=http://inhance.iarc.fr/projects.php |publisher=The International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium |accessdate=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study looking at laryngeal cancer and beverage type concluded, "This study thus indicates that in the Italian population characterized by frequent wine consumption, wine is the beverage most strongly related to the risk of laryngeal cancer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Garavello W, Bosetti C, Gallus S |title=Type of alcoholic beverage and the risk of laryngeal cancer |journal=European Journal of Cancer Prevention |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=69–73 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16374233 |doi=10.1097/01.cej.0000186641.19872.04|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the epidemiological literature published from 1966 to 2006 concluded that:
* The risk of esophageal cancer nearly doubled in the first two years following alcohol cessation, a sharp increase that may be due to the fact that some people only stop drinking when they are already experiencing disease symptoms. However, risk then decreased rapidly and significantly after longer periods of abstention.
* Risk of head and neck cancer only reduced significantly after 10 years of cessation.
* After more than 20 years of alcohol cessation, the risks for both cancers were similar to those seen in people who never drank alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Alcohol and cancer: is drinking the new smoking? |publisher=Centre for Addiction and Mental Health |date=26 September 2007 |url=http://www.camh.net/News_events/News_releases_and_media_advisories_and_backgrounders/alcohol_cancer_research.html |accessdate=29 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907043554/http://www.camh.net/News_events/News_releases_and_media_advisories_and_backgrounders/alcohol_cancer_research.html |archivedate=7 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Alcohol And Cancer: Is Drinking The New Smoking? |publisher=[[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]], [[Science Daily]] |date=28 September 2007 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070926094722.htm |accessdate=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For both habits, an explanation of the moderate increase in risk observed in some investigations might be attributed to residual confounding by smoking, or to an association between alcohol, coffee, and yet unidentified risk factors for bladder cancer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Pelucchi C, La Vecchia C |title=Alcohol, coffee, and bladder cancer risk: a review of epidemiological studies |journal=Eur.

==Recommended maximum alcohol intake==
{{Main|Recommended maximum intake of alcoholic beverages}}
As outlined above, there is no recommended alcohol intake with respect to cancer risk alone as it varies with each individual cancer. See [[Recommended maximum intake of alcoholic beverages]] for a list of governments' guidances on alcohol intake which, for a healthy man, range from 140–280g per week.

One meta-analysis suggests that risks of cancers may start below the recommended levels. "Risk increased significantly for drinkers, compared with non-drinkers, beginning at an intake of 25 g (&lt; 2 standard drinks) per day for the following: cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (relative risk, RR, 1.9), esophagus (RR 1.4), larynx (RR 1.4), breast (RR 1.3), liver (RR 1.2), colon (RR 1.1), and rectum (RR 1.1)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/act/alcoholandhealth/issues/issue_sept04/html/92004saitz_corrao.html Alcohol and Serious Consequences: Risks Increase Even With "Moderate" Intake] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920232028/http://www.bu.edu/act/alcoholandhealth/issues/issue_sept04/html/92004saitz_corrao.html |date=20 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Corrao G, Bagnardi V, Zambon A, La Vecchia C |title=A meta-analysis of alcohol consumption and the risk of 15 diseases |journal=Preventive Medicine |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=613–9 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15066364 |doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2003.11.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Cancer Research Fund recommends that people aim to limit consumption to less than two drinks a day for a man and less than one drink a day for a woman. It defines a "drink" as containing about 10–15&amp;nbsp;grams of ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;World Cancer Research Fund, Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective, http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohol industry manipulation of the science on alcohol and cancer==
A study published in 2017 has found that front organisations set up by the world's leading alcohol companies are actively misleading the public about the risk of cancer due to alcohol consumption. The study drew parallels with the long-standing activities of the tobacco industry. It also claimed that there was a particular focus on misleading women drinkers, because much of the misinformation about cancer produced by these companies was found to be focused on breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Petticrew M, Maani Hessari N, Knai C, Weiderpass E|title=How alcohol industry organisations mislead the public about alcohol and cancer |journal=Drug and Alcohol Review [Epub ahead of print]|date=September 2017 |pmid=28881410|doi=10.1111/dar.12596|display-authors=etal|volume=37|pages=293–303}}[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dar.12596/full]&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO/MAL/83.999, WHO/MAL/83.873M.&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. falciparum'' is one of the four main protozoan parasites that cause malaria and is one of the leading causes of malaria deaths. This species complex is of high medical importance for malaria control, in view of the biological specificities of the members of this complex. Sympatric sibling species of the complex differ in types of larval habitat, seasonality and behaviour. These differences also exist within the species suggesting the role of environmental factors in determining these.&lt;ref name=Obsomer /&gt;

'''''Bedlam: London and Its Mad''''' is a 2008 book by [[British people|British]] author, academic and journalist [[Catharine Arnold]]. 

==Synopsis==
The book follow developments in societal treatment of mental illness and the mentally ill, from the cruel days of [[Bethlem Hospital]] (often known as "Bedlam") to the campaigning psychiatrists who secured advances in treatment and changes in societal viewpoints. 

==Reception==
In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Patrick McGrath made some criticisms of the book, arguing 'Arnold occasionally makes wild claims' but notes that the strength of the book is 'the author indulges all that is quirky and macabre in the fascinating story of madness in England',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/23/nonfiction.books&lt;/ref&gt; while in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' Maureen Walker described the book as a 'elegantly written and richly anecdotal study'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-1042885/Bedlam-brutal-truth.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Psychiatric Times'' was rather more critical, with the reviewer writing 'Is Bedlam accurate, historically reliable, and of academic and therapeutic value? I think not' and 'In the final page of the book, we discover that “over the years, [the author has] learned to embrace melancholy,” and “some of us prefer to endure ‘melancholy’ in its various manifestations and accept that this variety of madness is part of our identity.” A “Government Health Warning” should accompany this frank, therapeutic nihilism and negativity toward psychiatric treatment'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/film-and-book-reviews/bedlam-london-and-its-mad&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Act 1723''' ([[List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, 1720–1739|9 Geo. 1 c. 22]]) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] passed in 1723 in response to a series of raids by two groups of [[poaching|poachers]], known as the Blacks. Arising in the aftermath of the [[South Sea Bubble]]'s collapse and the ensuing economic downturn, the Blacks gained their name from their habit of blacking their faces when undertaking poaching raids. They quickly demonstrated both "a calculated programme of action, and a conscious social resentment",{{sfn|Rogers|1974|p=468}} and their activities led to the introduction of the Black Act to Parliament on 26 April 1723; it came into force on 27 May. The Act introduced the death penalty for over 50 criminal offences, including being found in a forest while disguised, and "no other single statute passed during the eighteenth century equalled [the Black Act] in severity, and none appointed the punishment of death in so many cases".{{sfn|Radzinowicz|1945|p=56}} Following a criminal law reform campaign in the early 19th century, it was largely repealed on 8 July 1823, when a reform bill introduced by [[Robert Peel]] came into force.

The [[London Building Act 1774]], which imposed restrictions on exterior decoration, was also known as the Black Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Santo|first1=Philip|title=Inspections and Reports on Dwellings: Assessing Age|date=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=83|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Street|first1=Emma|title=Architectural Design and Regulation|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following the [[South Sea Bubble]]'s collapse in 1720, Britain suffered an economic downturn that led to heightened social tensions. A small element of this was the activity of two groups of [[poacher]]s, based in [[Hampshire]] and [[Windsor Great Park|Windsor Forest]] respectively.{{sfn|Rogers|1974|p=467}} The first flurry of activity came from the Hampshire group, and began in October 1721 when 16 poachers assembled in [[Farnham]] to raid the park of the [[Bishop of Winchester]]. Three deer were carried off, and two others killed; four of the poachers were later caught, with two released due to a lack of evidence and the others [[pillory|pilloried]] and sentenced to a year and a day in prison. The poachers became known as the "Blacks", due to their practice of blackening their faces to prevent identification; most famously, the Hampshire groups were the "[[Waltham Chase|Waltham]] Blacks". In response to the convictions, the poachers decided to attack the Bishop's property again, demonstrating "a calculated programme of action, and a conscious social resentment" that distinguished them from normal poachers. In the reprisal attack, 11 deer were taken and many more killed, leading to a royal proclamation offering £100 for information that led to the arrest of the gang.{{sfn|Rogers|1974|p=468}} This was followed by a series of raids highlighting a "fairly direct class hatred", that culminated in the raid of a shipment of wine ordered for [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. This proved to be the final straw, with [[Francis Page (judge)|Sir Francis Page]], a "notorious hanging judge", sent to the [[Assizes|Winchester Assizes]] to preside over any prosecutions, forcing the Hampshire Blacks underground.{{sfn|Rogers|1974|p=470}}

The Windsor Blacks then began their activities, copying the Hampshire group. Their main target was [[Caversham Park]], owned by the [[William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan|Earl of Cadogan]], with a series of increasingly audacious raids in 1722 and 1723 including one in which a gamekeeper's son was killed.{{sfn|Rogers|1974|p=471}} In response to these actions, the government introduced the Black Act, [[long title|formally]] "An Act for the more effectual punishing wicked and evil disposed Persons going armed in Disguise and doing Injuries and Violence to the Persons and Properties of His Majesty's Subject, and for the more speedy bringing the Offenders to Justice",{{sfn|Radzinowicz|1945|p=56}} to Parliament on 26 April 1723; it came into force on 27 May.{{sfn|Broad|1988|p=70}}

==Act==
The Act dealt with any offender who was armed and with a blacked face, armed and otherwise disguised, merely blacked, merely disguised, [[Accessory after the fact|accessories after the fact]] or "any other person or persons".{{sfn|Radzinowicz|1945|p=57}} If anyone who fitted into one of the above categories was found in a forest, [[Chase (land)|chase]], [[Downland|down]] or [[Royal Parks of London|Royal Park]], they could be sentenced to death.{{sfn|Radzinowicz|1945|p=58}} Similarly, it was an offence to hunt, kill, wound or steal deer in these locations, with the first offence punishable by a fine, and the second by [[penal transportation]].{{sfn|Radzinowicz|1945|p=59}} Other criminalised activities included fishing, the hunting of hares, the destruction of fish-ponds, the destruction of trees and the killing of cattle in these locations – the latter also punishable by death.{{sfn|Radzinowicz|1945|p=60-67}} An offender could also be executed if he set fire to corn, hay, straw, wood, houses or barns, or shot another person.{{sfn|Radzinowicz|1945|p=68}} The same penalties applied to attempting to rescue anyone imprisoned under the Black Act, or attempting to solicit other people to participate in crimes that violated it.{{sfn|Radzinowicz|1945|p=72}} In total, the Act introduced the death penalty for over 50 criminal acts.{{sfn|Vann|1977|p=181}}

==Aftermath==
Three of the Blacks' leaders had already been captured during the passage of the Act,{{sfn|Rogers|1974|p=471}} although one later escaped, and a series of raids captured a total of 32 Blacks who were tried after the Act's passage in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Four were sentenced to death for the killing of the gamekeeper's son, with the executions occurring on 15 June 1723.{{sfn|Rogers|1974|p=472}} Trials for the others continued into 1724, and 7 more were captured and tried on 7 December. This marked the effective end of the Blacks as an organised group.{{sfn|Rogers|1974|p=481}} At the time, it was thought that the Blacks were [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], with Sir [[Robert Walpole]] encouraging these ideas to advance his own interests; the rationale for the Act has been described as "at least as much to do with the hysteria induced by Walpole...as with any need for new powers to fight deer-stealing".{{sfn|Broad|1988|p=71}}

Modern scholars have differed in their view of whether the Blacks were Jacobites or not. Some argue that the links between the Blacks and the Jacobites were "fantasies",{{sfn|Broad|1988|p=71}} and that the Blacks were "simply a mixed group of foresters: labourers, yeomen and some gentry defending their customary rights".{{sfn|Vann|1977|p=180}} Others, however, have claimed that the Blacks were closely connected with Jacobitism and that the Black Act was designed to combat this political threat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Monod|Paul Kleber Monod]], ''Jacobitism and the English People, 1688–1788'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eveline Cruickshanks and Howard Erskine-Hill, ‘The Waltham Black Act and Jacobitism’, ''Journal of British Studies'' 24 no. 3 (1985), pp. 358–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1723 [[Baron Caryll of Durford|Philip Caryll]] was arrested by the government for drinking to the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Pretender]]'s health in the home of the Pretender's former nurse in [[Portsea, Portsmouth]]. An innkeeper of [[Horndean]] testified that Caryll held meetings at his inn with the former [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] MP [[Goring baronets|Sir Henry Goring]]. Goring fled to France after the Jacobite [[Francis Atterbury|Atterbury Plot]] was discovered, in August 1722. It quickly became known to the Dutch ambassador that Goring had requested from the Waltham Blacks support for a Jacobite rising. The ambassador wrote that the Blacks were originally a group of smugglers and that their Jacobite allegiance was the primary reason for the passing of the Black Act.&lt;ref&gt;Monod, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Goring wrote to the Pretender on 6 May 1723:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had settled an affair with five gentlemen of that country who were each of them to raise a regiment of dragoons well mounted and well armed which I knew they could easily do for the men had horses and homes of their own, and were, to say the truth most of them, the persons who some time since robbed the late Bishop of Winchester's Park, and have increased in their number ever since. They go by the name of the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.&lt;ref&gt;Monod, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As late as the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite rising of 1745–46]] newspapers were reporting that the Blacks had reappeared in Hampshire, stealing deer and robbing parks.&lt;ref&gt;Monod, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Geoffrey Elton]] claimed that the Act was "passed not in order to suppress legitimate protest but because organized gangs were destroying deer and planning a Jacobite rising".&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Elton, ''The English'' (Blackwell, 1992), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act has been described as "severe and sanguinary",&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert White, ''The Natural History of Selborne'', "Letter VII To Thomas Pennant, Esquire", 1789.&lt;/ref&gt; and L. Radzinowicz notes in the ''[[Cambridge Law Journal]]'' that "no other single statute passed during the eighteenth century equalled [the Black Act] in severity, and none appointed the punishment of death in so many cases".{{sfn|Radzinowicz|1945|p=56}} Efforts to repeal it started in 1810, with comments by [[Sir William Grant|William Grant]] as part of a wider debate on penal reform; a formal recommendation for its repeal took almost a decade, with the publication of the ''Report on Criminal Laws'' in 1819 marking the first "official" suggestion that the law be removed from the statute books. Following the publication of the ''Report'', [[James Mackintosh|Sir James Mackintosh]] introduced a law reform bill that would have repealed the Act, but although it passed through the House of Commons successfully it was strongly opposed in the Lords.{{sfn|Radzinowicz|1945|p=78-9}} In 1823 he submitted a memo to the House of Commons, again suggesting the repeal of the Act, and a few months later [[Robert Peel]], the [[Home Secretary]], introduced a bill that repealed the entirety of the Black Act except for the provisions that criminalised setting fire to houses and shooting a person. This passed, and came into effect on 8 July 1823.{{sfn|Radzinowicz|1945|p=81}}

'''The Blue Button''' is a system for patients to view online and download their own [[personal health record]]s.  Several Federal agencies, including the [[United States Department of Defense|Departments of Defense]], [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]], and [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]], implemented this capability for their beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/BlueButton |title=Blue Button &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203042534/http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/BlueButton |archivedate=2012-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Blue Button has pledges of support from numerous health plans and some vendors of personal health record vendors across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See: "Growth of Blue Button," infra.&lt;/ref&gt; Data from Blue Button-enabled sites can be used to create portable medical histories that facilitate dialog among health care providers, caregivers, and other trusted individuals or entities.

Currently widespread Blue Button usage supports downloading human-readable data in ASCII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fridsma|first=Doug|title=Health IT Standards Committee Update  November 13, 2012|url=http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/hitsc_nov13_2012_fridsma.pdf|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebuttonplus.org/|title=Blue Button Implementation Guide|work=bluebuttonplus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; an implementation guide for data holders and developers to enable automated data exchange among Blue Button+ compliant applications using structured data formats. Blue Button+ is designed to enhance the ways consumers get and share their health information in human-readable and machine-readable formats; and to enable the use of this information in third-party applications.

==History==
===Origins===
The Blue Button initiative began during the [[Markle Foundation]] Work Group on Consumer Engagement meeting in New York City on January 27, 2010.&lt;ref name=Nazi2&gt;{{cite web|last=Nazi|first=Kim M.|title=VA’s Blue Button: Empowering People With Their Data|url=http://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/866/vas-blue-button-empowering-people-with-their-data/|publisher=Vantage Point|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At the time, [[Meaningful Use]] was newly authorized and dominated health care IT dialogue in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihealthbeat.org/articles/2010/3/2/meaningful-use-tops-list-of-concerns-in-new-health-it-survey.aspx?topic=ehrs|title='Meaningful Use' Tops List of Concerns in New Health IT Survey|work=ihealthbeat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the Markle Connecting for Health Community felt that while Meaningful Use criteria embraced patient engagement, the rules should also “[c]onsider individuals as information participants—not as mere recipients, but as information contributors, knowledge creators, and shared decision makers and care planners.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collaborative Comments on the Proposed EHR Incentives Program|url=http://www.markle.org/sites/default/files/20100315_ehrincent_cms0033p.pdf|publisher=Markle Connecting for Health, Engleberg Center for Health Care Reform at Brookings, Center for American Progress|accessdate=March 27, 2012|page=11|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Markle convened the Work Group on Consumer Engagement to focus on using [[health information technology]] (IT) to achieve this kind of patient engagement.&lt;ref name=Markle2&gt;{{cite web|title=Markle Connecting for Health Work Group on Consumer Engagement|url=http://www.markle.org/health/experts-impact/work-group-consumer-engagement|publisher=The Markle Foundation|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The January 2010 meeting included representatives from private industry, not-for-profit foundations, and the federal government.&lt;ref name=Markle2 /&gt; Kim Nazi, performance and evaluation manager for VA's My HealtheVet [[personal health record]] (PHR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=John|title=An uncertain prognosis for personal health records|url=http://fcw.com/Articles/2011/05/09/FEAT-personal-health-records.aspx?Page=3|publisher=Federal Computer Week|accessdate=March 27, 2012|page=3|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and a VA representative to the Work Group, said the attendees were from diverse backgrounds and that the discussion was “passionate”.&lt;ref name=Nazi2 /&gt;

The Department of Defense (DoD) first provided secure on-line access to patient health information in December 2009 with its TriCare Online (TOL) portal. In 2010, the DoD rebranded under the "Blue Button" construct and enabled health record downloads as well as access. The DoD has added additional health record information over time and continues to enhance its Blue Button features.

The Work Group discussed many challenges related to engaging patients: numerous health IT data standards, [[data confidentiality]] and privacy laws, and fortress-like health databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levin|first=Peter|title=Blue Button Challenge|url=http://www.iom.edu/Activities/PublicHealth/HealthData/2011-JUN-09/Opening-Session/Administrator.aspx|accessdate=2012-03-27|location=The Health Data Initiative Forum|date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   VA [[Chief Technology Officer]] (CTO) Peter Levin, also an attendee at the Markle Work Group meeting, described trying to balance the benefits of data standards with getting a solution to patients quickly.  He assessed that it was only when the group decided to break the problem down into the simplest possible solutions that they were able to progress.&lt;ref name=Levin2&gt;{{cite web|last=Levin|first=Peter|title=VA eHealth University 2010 podcast|url=http://www.podcast.tv/video-episodes/day-2-peter-l-levin-12902557.html|accessdate=2012-03-27|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central theme emerged from the dialogue: give patients their data. HHS CTO and U.S. CTO [[Todd Park]] summarized the decision as:  "Look, there's all this complicated stuff happening with health information.  But why can't we just do this: why can't we just let an American get a copy of their own information?  [A]nd don't worry about the format, don't worry about the standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Park|first=Todd|title=Citizen Centric Health: How Public/Private Partnerships are Changing the Game|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/showcase/details.aspx?uuid=731a3c54-58ec-4ef8-a23b-154ae79097fc|accessdate=2012-03-27|location=Microsoft Connected Health Conference|date=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The group agreed to create a large, prominent button that would represent data liquidity and access.&lt;ref name=Nazi2 /&gt;

===Implementation===
In August 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] announced that Veterans could soon “go to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] [[VistA#Patient Web Portal|website]], click a simple blue button, download or print your personal health records, so you have them when you need them and can share them with your doctors  . . . .”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.va.gov/open/videos/BlueButton.asx&lt;/ref&gt;

VA launched the Blue Button later that month (see "Growth of Blue Button", below).  In October 2010, US Chief Technology Officer [[Aneesh Chopra]], Health &amp; Human Services Chief Technology Officer [[Todd Park]], and VA Chief Technology Officer Dr. [[Peter L. Levin]] announced that VA and HHS’s Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services were offering Blue Button downloads to Veterans and to Medicare beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;Aneesh Chopra, Todd Park, and Peter L. Levin (2010-10-07). "‘Blue Button’ Provides Access to Downloadable Personal Health Data | The White House". Whitehouse.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue Button was designed to empower patients with their own health data and improve the quality of patient-clinician interactions with the expectation that these would contribute to enhanced quality of life, better treatment outcomes and potential reduction in costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/video/blue-button-and-ehrs-vermont|title=Video- Blue Button Initative [sic] and EHRs in Vermont - Providers &amp; Professionals - HealthIT.gov|work=healthit.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bluebuttondata.org/faq.php&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework on which Blue Button is based—including patient empowerment, data security and privacy protection – draws heavily on work by the Markle Foundation’s collaborative of industry stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markle.org/health/markle-common-framework/connecting-consumers|title=Markle - Connecting Consumers|work=markle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the Blue Button trademark was transferred from the Veterans Administration to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/120920tr.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standardization &amp; Interoperability ===

In 2012, efforts began by the Standards &amp; Interoperability Framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.siframework.org/Automate+Blue+Button+Initiative |title= Automate Blue Button Initiative |publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services / Office of the National Coordinator |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to standardize the content formats and transport mechanisms for Blue Button data in order to make them more interoperable between health data-holding organizations, patients, and patient-authorized 3rd-parties such as physicians, caregivers, as well as applications and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fridsma |first=Doug |url=http://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/electronic-health-and-medical-records/blue-button-initiative-enhancing-consumer-access-health-information/ |title=Call for Participation in the Automate Blue Button Initiative: Enhancing Consumer Access to Health Information |publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services / Office of the National Coordinator |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, ONC unveiled the [http://www.bluebuttonplus.org/ Blue Button+ Implementation Guide] to provide guidance to both data holders and third-party application developers to enable automated data exchange and data parsing features. The Blue Button+ implementation guide specifies appropriate structured data formats, transmission protocols, and APIs for developers to use when creating applications that rely on automated exchange of Blue Button-accessible health record data.

== Functions ==
The Blue Button is a symbol on a website —for example, an online patient portal provided by a health care provider or insurer — that patients may use to download their health information. Depending on the implementation, users can download a variety of information in multiple formats, including text and PDF. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans can download their self-entered information, such as additional insurance, and information from their medical record, including medications, allergies, and lab results.&lt;ref name="Departmentof"&gt;Department of Veterans Affairs Blue Button Website&lt;/ref&gt; They can also download their military personnel information like occupation specialty and pay details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stegon |first=David |url=http://fedscoop.com/vas-blue-button-now-includes-service-records/ |title=VA’s Blue Button Now Includes Service Records |publisher=FedScoop |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users of Department of Defense's [[TRICARE]] Online can use the Blue Button to download their medications, allergies, and lab results as a PDF or text file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall |first=Patrick |url=http://gcn.com/articles/2011/10/17/tricare-blue-button-profile-main.aspx |title=DOD's TRICARE Blue Button simplifies accessing medications, allergies and lab results - Government Computer News |publisher=Gcn.com |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations like Medicare or [[Aetna]] offer health claims information as a downloadable text file.

Using Blue Button, patients have an easy way to retrieve and keep track of their health. Blue Button offers physicians an easy way to provide that data to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalehealth.org/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Pledge%20Community%20Webinar%20-%202-28-12.pdf|title=Center for Patient and Family-Centered Care|work=nationalehealth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simplicity of the Blue Button format allows users to carry their health information which ever way suits them—print, thumb drive, or on their smart phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=September 5, 2011 at 2:23 am Greg Frisilone says: |url=http://craigconnects.org/2011/08/blue-button-%C2%AE-gives-access-to-health-information.html |title=Blue Button ® gives access to health information |publisher=craigconnects |date=2011-08-27 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers can create applications to enhance the use of this data, such as the application offered by [[Northrop Grumman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.is.northropgrumman.com/by_solution/health_it/advanced_health/mobile_health/va_mobile/index.html |title=VA Mobile Blue Button App |publisher=Is.northropgrumman.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth of Blue Button==

VA launched the Blue Button function on its patient portal, My HealtheVet, in August, 2010.&lt;ref name="va.gov"&gt;https://www.myhealth.va.gov/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  By May 2012, more than 500,000 individual (unique) Veterans had used the Blue Button to download their data. They opt-in to be able to download their health data, first by registering for a My HealtheVet account, and second, by validating their identity for privacy and security reasons, &lt;ref name="va.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="myhealth_FAQ"&gt;https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/anonymous.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_nfto=false&amp;_pageLabel=faqsHome&lt;/ref&gt; which includes appointment information, prescriptions and medications, laboratory results, vital signs and readings, military health history, and military occupations.&lt;ref name="myhealth_FAQ"/&gt;  In August 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that the Blue Button has one million registered patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2378 |title=Blue Button Reaches One Million Registered Patients |publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched its version of Blue Button in September, 2010 on the My Medicare patient portal, giving 40 million beneficiaries online access to their Medicare claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mymedicare.gov/|title=MyMedicare.gov:  Portal of Personalized Information|work=mymedicare.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Defense also added a Blue Button function to its Tricare Online patient portal in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tricareonline.com/portal/page/portal/TricareOnline/Portal&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, 2011, the VA Innovation Initiative (VAi2)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.va.gov/vai2/&lt;/ref&gt;  sponsored the Blue Button for All Americans Contest to encourage widespread use and assure that all Veterans had access to their Blue Button health data regardless of whether they sought care from VA or from a private non-VA health care provider.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2137|title=News Releases - Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|author=Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|work=va.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-07-18/pdf/2011-18014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In October, 2011, McKesson Corporation’s Relay Health Division won VA’s Blue Button contest by adding Blue Button functions to the patient portals which it offers through its 200,000 physician and 2,000 hospital clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/relayhealth%E2%80%99s-phr-wins-blue-button-contest|title=RelayHealth’s PHR wins Blue Button contest|work=Healthcare IT News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2188|title=News Releases - Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|author=Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|work=va.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.relayhealth.com/news-and-events/blog/RelayHealth-Donating-Blue-Button-For-All-Americans-Prize-to-Wounded-Warrior-Project.html|title=RelayHealth Donating 'Blue Button For All Americans' Prize to Wounded Warrior Project - RelayHealth|author=Jim Greene|work=relayhealth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These represent slightly less than one third of physicians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Healthcare/Physicians-and-surgeons.htm|title=Physicians and Surgeons|date=8 January 2014|work=bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and slightly more than one third of hospitals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aha.org/research/rc/stat-studies/fast-facts.shtml|title=Fast Facts on US Hospitals|work=aha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, 2011, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation launched a website to advocate cross-industry use of the Blue Button; its website collects the pledges of industry adopters of the technology, including United Health Care, Humana, Patients Like Me, Walgreens, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebuttondata.org/|title=Blue Button redirect|work=bluebuttondata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of those pledging support, Aetna, announced in September 2011 that it had added the Blue Button function to its patient portal, and in addition offered its beneficiaries the ability to share their Blue Button downloads with Aetna providers.  At the time, Aetna said it served more than 36 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.aetna.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=110617&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1606005&amp;highlight=|title=News Releases|work=aetna.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Health Group began offering Blue Button downloads to its commercial health plan beneficiaries in July, 2012, rolling out the capability to its customers.  The company expects 26 million plan beneficiaries will have access to Blue Button downloads by mid-2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/newsroom/news.aspx?id=90e6efb4-b596-4a54-8fb7-4fa2ae03bc1d|title=UnitedHealth Group - Newsroom|author=UnitedHealth Group|work=unitedhealthgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other private sector organizations contributed to the growth of Blue Button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.aol.com/2011/11/22/vas-blue-button-innovation-takes-private-healthcare-sector-by-s/|title=VA’s Blue Button Innovation Takes Private Healthcare Sector By Storm|work=Breaking Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example:
* Iatric Systems, Inc., a hospital-focused EHR vendor, includes the Blue Button on the patient portals of its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iatric.com/PtAccess|title=PtAccess Patient Portal Meets Meaningful Use|work=iatric.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Humetrix, Inc., offers a mobile Blue Button application through which patients can send their Blue Button data directly to their physicians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humetrix.com/ibb.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Microsoft HealthVault]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/healthvault/bluebutton.aspx|title=HealthVault|publisher=Microsoft|work=Microsoft HealthVault}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dossia]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dossia.org/blog/101-dossia-ready-to-accept-blue-button-data-from-cms-va&lt;/ref&gt; which are patient-controlled repositories of personal health information, each accept Blue Button data.
* Napersoft, Inc., a consumer communications management software company, uses Blue Button in its Talk2Health product to transmit data between patients, payers and providers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/napersoft-selected-as-presenter-at-health-data-initiative-forum-iii-the-health-datapalooza-2012-05-22&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management announced that it had requested all federal employee health benefit plans to add the Blue Button function to their patient portals.&lt;ref name=OPM-employees&gt;http://www.opm.gov/news/blue-button-added-to-health-insurance-carriers-for-federal-employees,1744.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opm.gov/carrier/carrier_letters/2011/2011-21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  FEHB’s health benefit plans are offered by more than 200 insurance carriers and serve approximately eight million federal employees (including Members of Congress), their families, and retirees.&lt;ref name=OPM-employees/&gt;

In May 2012, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] announced the White House [[Presidential Innovation Fellows]] which will focus on five program areas including expanding Blue Button capabilities nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Ferenstein|first=Gregory|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/23/the-21st-century-gold-rush-announced-at-disrupt-raw-data/ |title=The 21st Century Gold Rush Announced At Disrupt: Raw Data |publisher=techcrunch.com |date=2012-05-23 |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT wants to expand Blue Button to any patient in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burns|first=Ed|url=http://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/news/2240163116/ONC-looks-to-make-Blue-Button-public-boost-patient-engagement|title=ONC looks to make Blue Button public, boost patient engagement|website=searchhealthit.techtarget.com|date=2012-09-12|accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the ONC launched the Automate Blue Button Standards and Interoperability Framework Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riccardi|first=Lygeia|last2=Fridsma|first2=Doug|url=http://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/electronic-health-and-medical-records/blue-button-initiative-enhancing-consumer-access-health-information/|title=Call for Participation in the Automate Blue Button Initiative: Enhancing Consumer Access to Health Information|date=2012-08-09|accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which culminated in 2013 with the release of the Blue Button+ Implementation Guide.&lt;ref name=introducing-bbplus/&gt;

In 2012, ONC held the Blue Button Mashup Challenge to encourage the development of third-party applications that increase the usefulness of data downloaded via Blue Button. The first-prize winner, iBlueButton, is a smart phone app that takes data from Medicare’s online portal and organizes it into an easier to read, easier to navigate format. The second-prize winner, ID BlueButton, is a tablet-based application that parses health information downloaded through Blue Button and presents it in a form that more clearly shows changes in health indicators and medication use over time. The third-prize winner, InstantPHR, is a web app that uses data downloaded through Blue Button to automatically populate personal health records in Microsoft HealthVault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Button Mashup Challenge|url=http://www.health2con.com/devchallenge/blue-button-mash-up-challenge/|work=Health 2.0 Developer Challenge|publisher=Health 2.0, LLC|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blue Button+ ==

Blue Button+ extends the Blue Button concept to include a standardized data format and additional functionality for trusted, automated exchange of health data, and advanced parsing of health data to improve human readability.&lt;ref name=introducing-bbplus&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham-Jones|first1=Pierce|last2=Panchadsaram|first2=Ryan|title=Introducing Blue Button+|url=http://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/health-innovation/introducing-blue-button/|work=Health IT Buzz|publisher=Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT|accessdate=12 January 2014|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013,{{Citation needed|reason=source needed for release date|date=January 2014}} ONC released the Blue Button+ Implementation Guide, offering guidance and a toolkit for both data holders (such as health care providers and insurers) and third-party application developers seeking to add this functionality to their products and services. The Blue Button+ Implementation Guide is the result of a collaboration among more than 68 volunteer organizations.&lt;ref name=introducing-bbplus/&gt;

SMART Platforms, Harvard Medical School, and Boston Children’s Hospital built a proof-of-concept Blue Button+ app called Growth-tastic. With Growth-tastic, parents can view charts of their child’s height, weight, and BMI trended over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Laura|title=Engaging Patients with Blue Button+|url=http://www.additiveanalytics.com/blog/engaging-patients-blue-button/|work=Additive Analytics Blog|publisher=Additive Analytics, LLC|date=30 October 2013|accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage and Licensing ==

Originally, in 2010, organizations needed a license to use the Blue Button marks. As of September 2012, application and licensing is no longer required.  Usage of the Blue Button logo and brand is free, but must conform to the established [http://www.healthit.gov/patients-families/blue-button/blue-button-image%20 usage guidelines set by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services].

== Green Button and Red Button ==

Blue Button is part of a larger “My Data Initiative” that aims to empower consumers with the tools and information they need to make optimal choices.  Other, similar "button" projects include the Green Button (for personal energy usage data) and the Red Button (for personal educational data).

In September 2011, US CTO Aneesh Chopra challenged the energy industry to model a Green Button, off the successful Blue Button, where energy providers would give energy users their consumption data in an easy to read and use format at the click of the button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aneesh Chopra |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/09/15/modeling-green-energy-challenge-after-blue-button |title=Modeling a Green Energy Challenge after a Blue Button &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, two major California utilities—Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric—announced their implementation of Green Button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenbuttondata.org/greenabout.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324121214/http://www.greenbuttondata.org/greenabout.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-24 |title=Green Button — About |publisher=Greenbuttondata.org |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2012-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy customers can manage their consumption via their smart phones using the standard Green Button data format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Witkin |first=Jim |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/a-phone-app-for-turning-down-the-thermostat/# |title=Pushing the Green Button for Energy Savings - NYTimes.com |location=Silicon Valley (Calif) |publisher=Green.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Institute of Standards and Technology awarded a contract to HyperTek Inc. to work with developers and users to expand the Green Button initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Marks|url=http://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/emerging-tech-blog/2012/09/green-button-initiative-gets-down-work/58214/?oref=voicesmodule|title=GREEN BUTTON INITIATIVE GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS|date=2012-09-19|accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related initiatives ==

In healthcare, there is a related proposal for a Green Button, as a way for doctors to use summarized patient data for real time decision making at the point of care.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/7/1229.full&lt;/ref&gt; A related, patient-driven, green button initiative to promote the donation of medical data analogous to donation of organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-patients.net/archives/2011/07/the-green-button-idea-support-app-development-with-a-donate-my-data-button.html|title=The Green Button idea: support app development with a “Donate My Data” button - e-Patients.net|work=e-patients.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Department of Defense's implementation of the Blue Button was awarded one of the 10 GCN 2011 awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCloskey |first=Paul |url=http://gcn.com/Articles/2011/08/05/2011-GCN-Award-Winners.aspx?Page=3 |title=10 agency projects win 2011 GCN Awards |publisher=gcn.com |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bluepharma''' (full name Bluepharma - Indústria Farmacêutica, SA) is a [[pharmaceutical company]] of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ownership, which is located in [[Coimbra]], [[Portugal]].

==History==
Bluepharma's production plant was acquired from [[Bayer AG]] when, at the end of the 1990s, the [[Germany|German]] multinational company made a business decision to consolidate production at its headquarters in [[Germany]]. Bayer announced plans to sell the Coimbra manufacturing site by advertising in an international magazine. Paulo Barradas Rebelo, who had gained management and business skills and experience in logistics from a background as [[Chief Executive Officer]] of a major wholesaler and distribution company to about 500 pharmacy units within a co-operative, read about the planned sale. He contacted Sérgio Simões, who worked in research locally as a professor at the [[University of Coimbra]]. The two men, with Isolina Mesquita who was plant manager for Bayer's Coimbra site, decided they would set up a new company, Bluepharma, with the aim of acquiring the Bayer plant and developing it as an integrated contract manufacturing business. The new company took the responsibility for all former Bayer employees, so the German work culture is still present in Bluepharma.

Its buildings occupy about 14,000 sq m at several levels on a land area of 18,700 sq m. The buildings have had several improvements, the most significant being in 1989, when the site was still owned by Bayer, and in 1998. During the first half of the 2000s, the company built a laboratory between the two main buildings to do more research and development work.

==Business==
Bluepharma develops its activity on the following areas:
*Contract-manufacturing
*[[Biopharmaceutical]]s
*[[R&amp;D]]
*Commerce of [[Generic drug|generics]] in Portugal

Bluepharma has clients in Portugal, France, Germany and in the UK, among others. One of Bluepharma's main clients is Bayer to which the Portuguese company produced around 3.5 million units in 2004. Other clients include pharmaceuticals brands and companies such as Teva, Ivax, Arrow, EG LABO ([[Stada]]), Bexal ([[Hexal]]), Mepha ([[Ratiopharm]]) and Ciclum ([[Grünenthal]]).

Most Bluepharma's employees have academic degrees and many have post-graduate degrees (MSc and PhDs) as well.

The commercial department began activities in October 2003.

==Research &amp; Development==
In the [[R&amp;D]] area, Bluepharma has research projects in the [[biotechnology]] field and is developing generic.

'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty '''in [[Indonesia]]'''. Although the death penalty is enforced only sometimes in grave cases of premeditated murder, it is regularly applied to drug traffickers, drug dealers, and people in possession of modest quantities of illegal drugs. Terrorists often receive relatively "light" sentences of 10 or 20 years' incarceration, while those caught up with drugs, even minor dealers and simple drug users, who often are living in poverty, are routinely sentenced to death by firing squad.   

==History==
Though the death penalty existed as a punishment from the inception of the [[Indonesia|Republic of Indonesia]], the first judicial execution did not take place until 1973.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hood | first =Roger | title =The Death Penalty: A Worldwide Perspective | publisher =Oxford University Press | year =2003 | location =New York | pages =48 | isbn=978-0199251292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indonesian government does not issue detailed statistics about every person facing the death penalty in the country. In fact, "the search for precise figures is hampered by prevailing state secrecy over the death penalty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8757829/Three_Coming_Legal_Challenges_to_Indonesia_s_Death_Penalty_Regime|title=Three Coming Legal Challenges to Indonesia's Death Penalty Regime|author=Daniel Pascoe|work=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed, however, that there are around 130 people, Indonesians and foreign nationals, currently (as of 2013?) sentenced to die in Indonesia. About ten new death sentences are handed down annually, though executions are infrequent. Many of the [[prisoner]]s awaiting execution have been waiting for ten years or more. Four executions took place in 2013, the first since 2008. In 2014, no executions took place. In January 2015 six people (among them one Dutchman, one Brazilian, one Vietnamese, one Malawian and Nigerian) were shot for drug-related crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/indonesia-executes-6-drug-convicts-including-5-foreigners-1421548751 Indonesia Executes 6 Drug Convicts, Including 5 Foreigners]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, another eight men, including several Nigerian nationals, one Brazilian and [[Bali Nine|two Australian citizens]] were executed, also for drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/28/bali-nine-pair-executed-indonesia|title='Bali Nine' pair among eight executed for drug offences in Indonesia|first=Michael|last=Safi|date=28 April 2015|website=the Guardian|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/asien/empoerung-ueber-todesstrafe-indonesien-laesst-fuenf-auslaender-erschiessen-13376667.html|title=Empörung über Todesstrafe: Indonesien lässt fünf Ausländer erschießen|author=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH|date=17 January 2015|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia is well noted as "a strong advocate against the death penalty for its citizens abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7092813/The_Future_of_the_Mandatory_Death_Penalty_in_Malaysia_and_Singapore_Asian_Values_and_Abolition_in_Comparative_Perspective_with_Implications_for_Indonesia|title=The Future of the Mandatory Death Penalty in Malaysia and Singapore: "Asian Values" and Abolition in Comparative Perspective, with Implications for Indonesia|author=Andrew Novak|work=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal process==
Prisoners spend often a long time in prison before their sentence is finally carried out. Usually their final appeal has been exhausted through the trial court, two [[appellate court]]s, and consideration of clemency by the [[President of Indonesia|President]].

Prisoners and their families are notified 72 hours in advance of their pending execution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2900366/Bali-Nine-Australian-drug-smuggler-death-row-loses-appeal-clemency-face-Indonesian-firing-squad.html|title = Bali Nine drug smuggler could be given just 72 HOURS notice before he faces a firing squad after Indonesian President rejects his plea to be spared execution|date = 7 January 2015|accessdate = 22 January 2015|work = Daily Mail|author = Emily Crane|author2 = Nelson Groom|last-author-amp = yes|author3 = Candace Sutton}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually transferred to [[Nusa Kambangan]] island.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; They are woken up in the middle of the night and taken to a remote (and undisclosed) location and [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]].

The blindfolded prisoner is led to a grassy area where they have an option to sit or stand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The armed soldiers shoot at the prisoner from a range of five to ten metres, aiming at the heart.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Only three fire live bullets and the rest fire blanks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the prisoner survives the shot, the commander is required to shoot the prisoner in the brain with his own weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/world/asia/11iht-indo.1.14421132.html |title=Indonesia widens use of executions |newspaper=The New York Times |date=11 July 2008 |accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutionality==
In 2007, the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia|Indonesian Constitutional Court]] (Mahkamah Konstitusi Republik Indonesia) upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty for drug cases, by a vote of six to three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/putusan/putusan_sidang_eng_PUTUSAN%202_PUU_V_07%20-%20Hukuman%20Mati%20(Eng).pdf |title=Decision No. 2-3/PUU-V/2007 |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=30 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311042447/http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/putusan/putusan_sidang_eng_PUTUSAN%202_PUU_V_07%20-%20Hukuman%20Mati%20%28Eng%29.pdf |archivedate=11 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was brought by prisoners sentenced to death for drug crimes, including some of the [[Bali Nine]], a group of Australian citizens sentenced to prison and the death penalty for drug trafficking in [[Bali]] in 2005.

'''Distribute''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distribute|url=http://isdsdistribute.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a project of the [[International Society for Disease Surveillance (ISDS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Society for Disease Surveillance |url=http://www.syndromic.org/about-isds|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through use of the Distribute system, state and local public health agencies voluntarily contributed data on influenza like illness (ILI), and other syndromes of interest, for comparison with data from other jurisdictions.  Typically contributors sent data to Distribute on a daily basis.  These data were anonymous and described counts of emergency department visits within public health jurisdictions for several disease syndromes.  These counts, and the proportions derived from dividing each by the total number of visits for the jurisdiction, could be viewed by the general public and made available to contributing public health agencies to permit comparisons of acute respiratory illness in different states and cities.

The core principles of Distribute were:

# Share Aggregate Level Data
# Maintain Jurisdictional Control
# Minimize Barriers to Participation
# Create a Collaborative Surveillance Network

Distribute had both a public view,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distribute Public Site|url=http://isdsdistribute.org/|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing ILI data for jurisdictions in the United States, and a restricted site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distribute Restricted Site|url=https://isds-auth.cirg.washington.edu/distribute-auth-gate/gate.php?req=%2Fdistribute%2F%3Faadisabled&amp;reason=first_access}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more granular data and user-driven visualizations available to contributors.

In 2012, ISDS posted the following messages:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The evolving nature of syndromic surveillance practice in the US has led ISDS to make the difficult decision to end its management of the Distribute system. As of April 4, 2012, ISDS will no longer be displaying visualizations of the Proportion of Emergency Department Visits For Influenza-like Illness (ILI) per Week on this site. The Distribute Project will continue to collect data until May 31, 2012. Until that time, data providers will have access to the Distribute Restricted site ([https://isds-auth.cirg.washington.edu/distribute/]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) and Community Forum.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;CDC funding for Distribute ends May 31, 2012. The Distribute Restricted site is currently scheduled to be taken off line May 31, 2012.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13061">'''Dysphoric milk ejection reflex''' ('''D-MER''') is an [[:wikt:anomaly|anomaly]] of the milk release mechanism in [[lactating]] women. A lactating woman who has D-MER experiences a brief [[dysphoria]] just prior to the [[milk ejection reflex]].

== Presentation ==
The lactating woman who has D-MER experiences a brief period of dysphoria that begins just prior to the milk ejection reflex and continues for not more than several minutes. It may recur with every milk release or only with the initial milk release at each feeding. D-MER always presents as an emotional reaction but may also produce a hollow or churning feeling in the pit of the stomach. When experiencing D-MER mothers may report any of a spectrum of different unpleasant emotions, ranging from depression to anxiety to anger.  Each of these emotions can be felt at a different level of intensity.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"&gt;Lawrence and Lawrence. Breastfeeding: A Guide for the Medical Professional, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File: Intensities of D-MER.jpg|thumb|right|Slide conveying the range of emotions felt by someone experiencing D-MER]]

===Spectrum and intensity===
Women who experience D-MER can experience a wide range of negative emotions that fall on what is referred to as the Spectrum of D-MER.  These emotions usually fall into three categories, including despondency, anxiety, and aggression. The D-MER spectrum of emotions can occur at any of several intensities, without changing the type of emotion. For example, a woman may experience a sense of depression and this feeling can range from mild homesickness or wistfulness to more intense feelings of hopelessness and self-loathing.  Similarly, anxiety may range from restlessness to more intense panic and dread.  Anger, the least likely of the three, may range from tension and agitation to more intense feelings of hostility and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Before The Letdown: Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex and the Breastfeeding Mother by Alia Macrina Heise 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==
The mechanism is not clear. In a mother with D-MER, dopamine may fall inappropriately with milk release, causing the negative feelings. Among the hormones involved in milk production and release are [[oxytocin]], [[prolactin]], and [[dopamine]].  Oxytocin, released in pulsatile "spikes" from the [[posterior pituitary]] in response to nipple/areolar stimulation, thoughts of the baby or of breastfeeding, or overfull breasts, travels through both brain and bloodstream, causing emotional changes in the brain and the release of milk in the breast.  Prolactin, released in a gradual wave that peaks after the beginning of a feeding, is responsible for continued milk production.  Dopamine inhibits the release of prolactin, so dopamine levels must drop in order for prolactin levels to rise. Some speculate that the necessary dopamine drop is similar to (and timed with) the oxytocin spike – a sort of negative image – but that in D-MER mothers it drops either too far or somehow differently, causing a negative emotional reaction as a result
&lt;ref&gt; Before The Letdown: Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex and the Breastfeeding Mother by Alia Macrina Heise 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism is speculative.  What is known is that at least some of the time, supporting dopamine levels reduces D-MER in susceptible mothers.

== Misconceptions ==
*D-MER does not appear to be a [[psychological]] response to breastfeeding. It is possible for women to have psychological responses to breastfeeding, but D-MER gives evidence of being a [[physiological]] reflex. [http://d-mer.org/Is_It_Psychological_.html]
*D-MER is not nausea with letdown or any other isolated physical manifestation that happens with letdown (hives, headaches, thirst, etc.) Some D-MER mothers may also have a churning in their stomach that can cause a brief aversion food and even water, but D-MER always includes an emotional manifestation.  [http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/nausea-bf.html]
*D-MER is not [[postpartum depression]] or a postpartum mood disorder. A mother can have D-MER and PPD, but they are separate conditions and the common treatments for PPD do not treat D-MER. The majority of mothers with D-MER report no other mood disorders. [http://www.postpartumprogress.com/weblog/2009/06/for-moms-who-feel-bad-before-breastfeeding-this-may-be-why.html]
*D-MER is not the "breastfeeding aversion" that can happen to some mothers when continuing to nurse while pregnant. Breastfeeding aversion occurs upon nipple contact when nursing whereas D-MER is triggered by the let-down reflex, even if it is several minutes after latching. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266613816000577|title=Maternal experiences of embodied emotional sensations during breastfeeding: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
What has been shown to be effective to eliminating D-MER is anything that raises and maintains dopamine. There are a variety of foods, herbal medications and prescription options that do this, but not all of them are appropriate for the condition or for an otherwise healthy breastfeeding mother.&lt;ref name="Wiessinger"&gt;[[Diane Wiessinger|Wiessinger, Diane]]. D-MER, What Is It?, Breastfeeding Today 2010&lt;/ref&gt; At this time there is no product that is medically approved to treat D-MER.  However, treatment is rarely needed.

=== Emotional support and validation ===
The most effective treatments for D-MER found thus far are awareness, understanding, and education. Many mothers with D-MER rate their D-MER much worse prior to learning what is causing their feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d-mer.org/Specifics_of_D-MER.html|title=Specifics of D-MER|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a mother understands that she is not alone in her condition and realizes it is a physiological condition she seems to be much less likely to wean prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266613816000577|title=Maternal experiences of embodied emotional sensations during breastfeeding: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the overwhelmingly positive effect of awareness and connection with other "D-MER mothers," much energy has been put into educating mothers and lactation professionals about the condition. D-MER is an increasingly common topic for presentations at lactation seminars in the US &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lactspeak.com/aliamacrina/conference/|title=List of D-MER presentations and conferences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Europe and Australia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keepingabreastinvictoria.blogspot.com/2008/12/breastfeeding-seminar-series.html|title=Keeping Abreast in Victoria: Breastfeeding Seminar Series|first=Yvette|last=Odowd|date=10 December 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; interest in the US is also growing.  D-MER.org holds much of the information currently available on D-MER. Also available through the website are an online media presentation on YouTube, a [[Facebook]] group with a message board and a Facebook page that sends links to the latest online information about D-MER to members' news feeds.

== Identification and description ==
The first documented reference to a hormonally based negative emotional reaction while breastfeeding was found online in a forum in June 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716070322/http://www.mothering.com/community/forum/thread/156605/strange-feeling Strange Feeling]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the launch of D-MER.org the phenomenon was unknown, unnamed, misunderstood and rarely mentioned or talked about. The term dysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER) came from Alia Macrina Heise&lt;ref name="Wiessinger"/&gt; who was the first to identify and describe the phenomenon to lactation professionals in 2007. It was chosen due to the emotional reaction (dysphoria) to milk let-down (milk ejection reflex). The "milk ejection reflex" is abbreviated among lactation professionals and referred to as the M-E-R. This means that D-MER is not said DEE-MERE, but rather D.M.E.R, all the letters names said individually. In 2008 a team of lactation consultants, headed up by [[Diane Wiessinger]], MS, IBCLC, LLLL worked together and consulted with other medical professionals to do a preliminary investigation to better understand D-MER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d-mer.org/LCs_Concur.html|title=LCs Concur|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first published case study of D-MER,&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;Cox, Suzanne. A Case of Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex, Breastfeeding Review 2010; 18 (1): 16-18&lt;/ref&gt; it became a more widely known and accepted condition with ongoing study being pursued by healthcare professionals.&lt;ref&gt; http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/bfm.2017.0086 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
D-MER has been mentioned in several breastfeeding texts and self-help books since 2010 and awareness of this anomaly is steadily growing across the internet and within the medical community.  References to D-MER can be found in the news &lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/06/14/dmer-scary-breast-feeding-condition-youve-never-heard.html&lt;/ref&gt;, on blogs, Twitter and even Reddit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1utoo6/dmer/|title=D-MER? • r/breastfeeding|website=reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of March 2014, there has been no scientific research studies involving mothers who experience D-MER to support the hypothesis that it is caused by the drop in dopamine just prior to the milk ejection reflex.  There is a strong argument for this hypothesis in the original case study.&lt;ref&gt;Heise, A. M., Wiessinger, D. "Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex: A Case Report" International Breastfeeding Journal. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17934">The '''Effect Model law''' states that a natural relationship exists for each individual between the frequency (observation) or the probability (prediction) of a morbid event without any treatment &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{(Rc)}&lt;/math&gt; and the frequency or probability of the same event with a treatment &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{(Rt)}&lt;/math&gt;. This relationship applies to a single individual, individuals within a population, or groups.
This law enables the prediction of the (absolute) benefit (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{AB}&lt;/math&gt;) of a treatment for a given patient. It has wide-reaching implications in R&amp;D for new pharmaceutical products as well as [[personalized medicine]].
The law was serendipitously discovered in the 1990s by [[Jean-Pierre Boissel]]. While studying the effectiveness of class-I [[antiarrhythmic drugs]] in the prevention of death after [[myocardial infarction]],&lt;ref&gt;Boissel, J. P.; Collet, J. P.; Lievre, M.; Girard, P. An effect model for the assessment of drug benefit: example of antiarrhythmic drugs in postmyocardial infarction patients. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993, 22, 356–363.&lt;/ref&gt;  he stumbled upon a situation which contradicts one of the basic premises of [[meta-analysis]] theory, i.e. that the heterogeneity test was significant at the same time for the assumption “the [[relative risk]] (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{RR}&lt;/math&gt;) is a constant” and “&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{AB}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant”.

Boissel formulated the hypothesis that the antiarrhythmic drugs efficacy was a function combining a beneficial effect (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{a}&lt;/math&gt;) that is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rc}&lt;/math&gt; and a constant adverse effect (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{b}&lt;/math&gt;), independent of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rc}&lt;/math&gt;. The mathematical expression of this model is a linear equation with two parameters, the risk of lethal adverse event caused by treatment and the slope of the line which represents the true beneficial risk reduction. This equation gives the treatment net mortality reduction:&lt;ref&gt;Boissel, J. P. Individualizing aspirin therapy for prevention of cardiovascular events. JAMA 1998, 280, 1949–1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, W.; Gueyffier, F.; Boissel, J. P.; Girard, P.; Boutitie, F.; Cucherat, M. [Identification and prediction of responders to a therapy. A model and its preliminary application to hypertension]. Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss 1998, 91, 1059–1063.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPB2008"&gt;Boissel, J. P.; Cucherat, M.; Nony, P.; Chabaud, S.; Gueyffier, F.; Wright, J. M.; Lièvre, M.; Leizorovicz, A. New insights on the relation between untreated and treated outcomes for a given therapy effect model is not necessarily linear. Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 2008, 61, 301–307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPB_RK_2011"&gt;Boissel, J.-P.; Kahoul, R.; Amsallem, E.; Gueyffier, F.; Haugh, M.; Boissel, F.-H. Towards personalized medicine: exploring the consequences of the effect model-based approach. Personalized Medicine 2011, 8, 581–586.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ Rt= a \times Rc + b}&lt;/math&gt;

== Illustration in the (Rc,Rt) plane ==
In 1987, L'Abbe, Detsky and O'Rourke recommended including a graphical representation of the various trials while designing a meta-analysis. For each trial, on the x-axis the frequency (risk) of the studied criterion in the control group &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{(Rc)}&lt;/math&gt; should be represented, and on the y-axis, the risk in the treated group &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{(Rt)}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;L’Abbe, K. A.; Detsky, A. S.; O’Rourke, K. Meta-analysis in clinical research. Annals of Internal Medicine 1987, 107, 224–233.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Media:COM MAT 20130606 Effect Model wikipedia page.001.png|Figure 1]] and [[Media:COM MAT 20130606 Effect Model wikipedia page.002.png|Figure 2]]).

[[File:COM MAT 20130606 Effect Model wikipedia page.001.png|thumb|right|Figure 1. The &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{(Rc,Rt)}&lt;/math&gt; plane according to L'Abbe et al. For the studied criteria (therapeutic objective), the diagonal separates the harmful treatment area from the efficient treatment area.]]

The shape of the resulting [[scatter plot]] illustrates some important aspects of the information concerning the effect of the treatment:
* On an individual basis, the ability to measure and predict the absolute benefit of a treatment for a patient characterized by his or her idiosyncratic risk parameters (e.g., cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, etc.);
* Over a given population (e.g., French, Chinese, etc.), the ability to measure and predict health outcomes for a treatment available on the market or a drug candidate at any stage in the R&amp;D process (from the target identification phase to [[clinical trial]]s).

[[File:COM MAT 20130606 Effect Model wikipedia page.002.png|thumb|right|Figure 2. The Effect Model framework and patient-centered outcomes.]]

The law is expressed in two ways.
# the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rt}&lt;/math&gt; function: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rt=f(Rc,X)}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rt=g(Y,X)}&lt;/math&gt;, equation in which &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rc}&lt;/math&gt; is implicit.
# the absolute benefit function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{AB}&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{AB=Rc-Rt=h(Y,X)}&lt;/math&gt;, equation in which &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rc}&lt;/math&gt; are implicit.

The forms above lead to as many values in the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{(Rc,Rt)}&lt;/math&gt; plane as there are patients, each one being represented by a dot which is more or less close to the neutrality frontier. The expression of the absolute benefit &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{AB}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the vertical distance to the neutrality frontier) has the advantage of leading directly to an individual prediction, making personalized medicine a practical reality. The &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Y}&lt;/math&gt; are, respectively, patients descriptors linked with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rc}&lt;/math&gt; and with the treatment&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\times}&lt;/math&gt;patient interactions.

By summing up &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{AB_{i}}&lt;/math&gt; over the entire population of interest, the model yields a quantified efficacy metric over “real” patients, called the Number of Prevented Events (NPE).
Since each patient responds to a proposed therapy in a different way, it is too simplistic to consider a digital outcome for a treatment, i.e. efficient or inefficient. Rather, a given patient will benefit by an order of magnitude which will vary depending on his or her risk profile. This magnitude is measured by the quantity:

::'''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{AB_{i}=Rt_{i}-Rc_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;'''

This illustrates an intuition that all doctors have, and that Kaurer and Kassirer emphasized in 1980: a treatment can yield little benefit; even worse, it can be more harmful than beneficial for "moderately sick" patients.&lt;ref&gt;Pauker, S. G.; Kassirer, J. P. The threshold approach to clinical decision making. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980, 302, 1109–1117.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the case where the Effect Model is curvilinear, as shown in [[Media:COM MAT 20130606 Effect Model wikipedia page.002.png|Figure 2]], it is easy to understand intuitively that:
* Low-risk patients (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rc&lt;0.1}&lt;/math&gt;) don’t benefit from the treatment as much as higher-risk patients;
* High-risk patients (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rc&gt;0.9}&lt;/math&gt;) are less likely to avoid the clinical event, irrespective of the treatment.

== Evidence of the existence of the law ==
Evidence of the existence of the Effect Model law is supported by [[empirical]] observations (the aforementioned study of antiarrhythmic drugs in post-myocardial infarction), simulations as well as a theoretical demonstration.
The simulation approach consists in combining a [[mathematical model]] of the disease of interest and the intended treatment, combining it with a population of virtual patients and in applying the disease model and then the therapeutic model (treatment acting on the disease) to every virtual subject.&lt;ref name="JPB2008" /&gt; The outcome is always a connection between &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Rc}&lt;/math&gt; (refer to [[Media:COM MAT 20130606 Effect Model wikipedia page.003.png|Figure 3]] below).

[[File:COM MAT 20130606 Effect Model wikipedia page.003.png|thumb|right|Figure 3. Figure derived from the graph representing the three pillars of Novadiscovery’s technology based on the Effect Model law. This figure illustrates the simulation approach.]]

A proof of the intrinsic nature of the Effect Model is that it emerges from the combination of a disease model and a virtual population

== Applications: bridging the efficacy-effectiveness gap ==
In a 2011 [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] article, authors showed that it is necessary to develop and use a broad range of methods to be able to bridge the efficacy-effectiveness gap frequently observed in clinical practice. This gap stems from the differences between satisfactory efficacy data from [[clinical trial]]s and the actual health outcomes observed in real life once the drug enters the market.&lt;ref&gt;Eichler, H.-G.; Abadie, E.; Breckenridge, A.; Flamion, B.; Gustafsson, L. L.; Leufkens, H.; Rowland, M.; Schneider, C. K.; Bloechl-Daum, B. Bridging the efficacy-effectiveness gap: a regulator’s perspective on addressing variability of drug response. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2011, 10, 495–506.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the
NPE can serve as a decision-support metric to drive resources allocation across a pipeline of pharmaceutical products, conduct comparative effectiveness analyses versus standard of care and cost-effectiveness studies. All of these combine into a powerful framework to establish the proof of commercial relevance of a drug product to regulators and payers in the context of pricing &amp; reimbursement negotiations.

It is expected that the Effect Model will gradually emerge as an industry standard accepted by regulatory and paying agencies to support their decisions. A first milestone was reached in February 2013 with the publication of a guideline by the European Network for Health Technology Assessment ([http://www.eunethta.eu/sites/5026.fedimbo.belgium.be/files/Applicability.pdf eunethta]) on the Relative Assessment of Pharmaceuticals, which mentions the Effect Model.&lt;ref&gt;EUnetHTA Levels of evidence. Applicability of evidence in the context of a relative effectiveness assessment of pharmaceuticals; European network for Health Technology Assessment, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transposability ===
There are 2 dimensions to transposability studies:
* The way clinical trial results – arguably an idealized setting, “transpose” into real-life patient outcomes on a selected population;
* In turn, how these results “transpose” from one population to another.
The Effect Model enables the simulation of a drug candidate’s impact on real populations. It also provides a powerful framework to explore the drivers of transposability of clinical trials results for a same drug from one population to another.

[[File:COM MAT 20130606 Effect Model wikipedia page.004.png|thumb|right|Figure 4. Transposability analyses with Novadiscovery’s  Effect Model framework.]]

=== Comparative effectiveness ===
With the payer-driven market’s shift from buying drug products to buying patient outcomes – as a result of mounting fiscal imbalances, proof of concept is not sufficient anymore. Pharmaceutical companies must establish the proof of commercial relevance, or superiority of their product over the standard of care.
With that in mind, the Effect Model is used to:
* Continuously benchmark a drug candidate’s value, as it progresses from discovery to clinical development, versus the prevailing comparator;
* Identify and characterize subgroups of patients where the drug candidate shows superior efficacy, if and when traditional clinical trials fail to demonstrate, on average, superior value.

[[File:COM MAT 20130606 Effect Model wikipedia page.005.png|thumb|right|Figure 5. Comparative effectiveness analyses with Novadiscovery’s Effect Model framework.]]

=== Cost effectiveness ===
The proof of commercial value should explicitly incorporate pricing considerations. What is being calculated in this instance is the Cost per Prevented Event. Given:
* The total amount of spending earmarked by a social security system to treat a particular disease;
* The treatment’s proposed unit price;
One can derive:
* The number of individuals who can be treated and the associated &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{AB_{i}}&lt;/math&gt; threshold;
* The Cost per Prevented Event.

[[File:COM MAT 20130606 Effect Model wikipedia page.006.png|thumb|right|Figure 6. Cost effectiveness analyses with Novadiscovery’s Effect Model framework.]]

== Extensions ==

=== R&amp;D decision support ===
The Effect Model and its associated concept of NPE provide an invaluable framework to base resources allocation decisions on an unbiased and informed representation of the predicted health outcomes of the product under development.
A large number of hypotheses can be tested against this NPE metric, from early discovery to clinical development and market access. Examples include:
* The identification of optimal therapeutic targets included in the disease model;
* The identification of the optimal vector of [[Theranostics|theranostic]] [[biomarker]]s;
* The characterization of optimal patient responders to reduce the size of clinical trials without negatively impacting the statistical significance of results.

=== Personalized medicine ===
Given a patient’s idiosyncratic [[risk factor]] values (e.g. cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, etc.) and other patient descriptors linked with treatment efficacy (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Y}&lt;/math&gt;), it is possible to locate him or her in the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{(Rc,Rt)}&lt;/math&gt; plane and estimate the associated &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{AB_{i}}&lt;/math&gt; between competing treatments. In this instance, the Effect Model serves as a powerful framework to support prescription decisions in day-to-day medical practice.&lt;ref name="JPB_RK_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RK2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boissel, J.P.; Kahoul, R.; Marin, D.; Boissel, F.H. Effect Model Law: An Approach for the Implementation of Personalized Medicine. J. Pers. Med. 2013, 3, 177-190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RK2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kahoul R, Gueyffier F, Amsallem E, et al. Comparison of an effect-model-law-based method versus traditional clinical practice guidelines for optimal treatment decision-making: application to statin treatment in the French population. Journal of the Royal Society Interface. 2014, 11(100):20140867. doi:10.1098/rsif.2014.0867.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Number Needed to Treat (NNT) and Number of Prevented Events (NPE) ==
The [[Number needed to treat|Number Needed to Treat (NNT)]] is often used to benchmark medicines. The drug with the lowest NNT is said to be more efficient than its competitors. However, the NNT benchmark is fundamentally flawed in its construct. 
NNT varies with treatment and/or follow-up duration, as shown by Kassaï et al.&lt;ref&gt;Kassai, B.; Gueyffier, F.; Boissel, J. P.; Boutitie, F.; Cucherat, M. Absolute benefit, number needed to treat and gain in life expectancy: which efficacy indices for measuring the treatment benefit? J Clin Epidemiol 2003, 56, 977–982.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kristiansen and Gyrd-Hansen.&lt;ref&gt;Kristiansen, I. S.; Gyrd-Hansen, D. Cost-effectiveness analysis based on the number-needed-to-treat: common sense or non-sense? Health Economics 2004, 13, 9–19.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore impossible to make apples-to-apples comparative analyses with this benchmark. For instance, there is no constant follow-up duration across diverse treatments’ randomized clinical trials that are used to compute the NNT.

A more fundamental weakness is the fact that the NNT changes with each patient’s profile. And there are large differences in average patient Rc, a profile marker, between trials in a given domain.

With the Effect Model law and the associated Number of Prevented Events (NPE), it becomes possible to account for this patient profile variability in a structured and cohesive way, thus enabling apples-to-apples benchmarking. 

The NNT fallacy has been denounced by several authors since Cook and Sackett, who cautioned that the NNT should not be used in patients with different baseline risks without a correction &lt;ref&gt;Cook, R. J.; Sackett, D. L. The number needed to treat: a clinically useful measure of treatment effect. BMJ British Medical Journal 1995, 310, 452–454.&lt;/ref&gt; in the particular context of personalized medical decision. However, the correction these authors suggested does work only if the treatment’s absolute benefit is a linear function of the baseline risk, as for the beta-blocker case, which is not always true as shown when the Effect Model is curvilinear.

'''Electrogustometry''' is the measurement of [[taste]] threshold by passing controlled anodal current through the tongue. When current passes through the tongue a unique and distinct [[Parageusia|metallic taste]] is perceived.

Electrogustometry has been in existence since the 1950s. However, not much research has been done in this field.

==Equipment==

TR Bull developed an electrogustometer, but it lacked precision and was not widely accepted. In the 1990s the Rion (TR-06) was developed. This was precise and is widely used in the market. The TR-06 is probably the only electrogustometer used now for research and diagnosis. This is manual and needs a trained doctor or nurse to use it. It needs to be manually calculated to arrive at the taste threshold and carry out the false positive tests.

Small, light and portable, this hand-held, battery-powered device can be easily placed in any environment. It has an inbuilt false positive detect test. This is developed to cater for the [[Psychophysics|psychophysical analysis]] of the subject.

==Influencing factors==
Electrogustometric taste threshold depends on pulse duration pulse and area of contact of electrode and tongue. Detailed experiments will be performed to prove and discuss their influence on taste threshold with the automatic electrogustometer. Experiments have been performed with the manual TR-06 on to study the effects of these control factors.

==Philosophy==
The measure of the minimum amount of current required to excite the sensation of this taste is called the 'taste threshold'. This project involves the design and fabrication of an automatic instrument to measure this taste threshold.

This case prompted authorities to raid the family's church in 2004 because it supports [[corporal punishment]].&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yee |first=Daniel |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:bn4t0xR46Y0J:news.findlaw.com/ap/o/51/02-07-2007/acda000b355197d5.html |title=US couple whose church backs corporal punishment go on trial in son's death |date=2007-02-07 |publisher=Associated Press }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The case ==

Josef Smith died at a children's hospital after paramedics were called to the family's home in Mableton, an Atlanta suburb.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt;

In October 2003 the boys' parents had told authorities Josef had passed out and never regained consciousness after the family gathered in the kitchen to participate in a prayer session with their church via the Internet.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt; Mr. Smith reportedly told police that when he went to pick his son up that he was "warm to the touch, wet with sweat, and unresponsive." Smith thought his son was overheating and he had carried the boy out to the carport and laid him down on the concrete hoping it would have a cooling effect, but that it didn't. They then called 911. Cobb County fire and rescue responded and found the eight-year-old lying on his back in the dining room, not breathing and without a pulse. He was rushed to the hospital where doctors later determined he was brain dead. He died a day later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pordum |first=Matt |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/smith/020807_ctv.html#storycont |title=Babysitter: Dad accused of killing his eight-year-old son told me to 'hit him hard' if he cried |date=2007-02-08 |publisher=Court TV |access-date=2007-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225195029/http://www.courttv.com/trials/smith/020807_ctv.html#storycont |archive-date=2007-02-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobb County [[medical examiner]]s concluded that eight-year-old Josef Smith died as a result of "acute and chronic" abuse. Police said that the parents often locked the boy in a closet and forced him to pray to a picture of Jesus.&lt;ref name="courttv.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pordum |first=Matt |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/smith/020607_background_ctv.html |title=Murder trial set to start for parents accused of beating their 8-year-old son to death |date=2007-02-09 |publisher=Court TV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224153226/http://www.courttv.com/trials/smith/020607_background_ctv.html |archivedate=2007-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smiths admitted disciplining their son by striking him with a [[glue stick]], but claimed the punishment never rose to the level of abuse.
&lt;ref name="courttv.com"/&gt;

== Church connection ==

The Smiths were members of the Brentwood, Tennessee-based [[Remnant Fellowship]] Church since they joined in 2000, which grew out of church leader [[Gwen Shamblin]]'s Weigh Down Workshop, a Christian diet program she created in 1986. Authorities raided the church in June 2004 as part of the investigation of Josef Smith's death.

The Smiths were arrested in December 2003 and spent four months in jail before Remnant church members posted their bond.&lt;ref name="wbir.com"&gt;http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=42009&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with Gwen Shamblin, she said that Remnant church members decided to collectively foot the Smiths' legal bills.&lt;ref name="wbir.com"/&gt;

Former members of the Smiths' church said the groups teachings on discipline include discussion of corporal punishment. Church leaders stated that they leave discipline to parents and that spankings are a last resort.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite news | last=Yee |first=Daniel |url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2007Mar27/0,4675,ChurchChildDeath,00.html | title=Ga. Parents Sentenced in Boy's Death |date=2007-03-27 | publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At one point, Remnant Fellowship's website contained the following testimony from a member:
"I was hesitant and sometimes refused to properly discipline my children because I didn't want to 'hurt' them or have them hate me." Now, "I discipline my children in order to save their souls from hell rather than being concerned about their flesh."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religionnewsblog.com/6064/newschannel-5-investigates-firm-beliefs-part-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Before jury selection, the Smiths' attorneys stated that the defense had made a deal with prosecution to limit the church's involvement in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Kalodimos| first =Demetria| coauthors =| title =Parents Charged In Child's Death To Go On Trial| work =| pages =| publisher =WSMV Nashville Channel 4 News| date =2007-02-05| url =http://www.wsmv.com/news/10928264/detail.html| accessdate =2007-05-30| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070402103312/http://www.wsmv.com/news/10928264/detail.html| archivedate =2007-04-02| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police investigators said they could not find any link between the boy's death and the religious institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Yee| first=Daniel |title=Couple get life terms for killing their son | work =| pages =| publisher =Associated Press | date =2007-03-27| url=http://www.cobbda.com/RECENTCASESINTHENEWS/SMITHMURDER/SonyaandJosephSmith.htm |accessdate=2007-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point they also owned www.thesmithsareguilty.com which automatically redirected you to the www.thesmithsareinnocent.com website.  Their site mainly contends that Joseph died from a bacterial infection as a result of "his chroic eczema and continual scratching he was plagued with."

After the Smiths' eventual conviction, Tedd Anger, one of the church's leaders, said they still believe the Smiths are innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2007Mar27/0,4675,ChurchChildDeath,00.html | work=Fox News | date=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, both the Cobb County medical examiner and the state medical examiner did agree that Josef's death was a homicide, not an accidental death and not a death due to illness.  At the trial, witnesses for the state called it one of the worst cases of child abuse they'd ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.11alive.com/news/article_news.aspx?storyid=92302&amp;provider=top&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the Smiths are still members of Remnant Fellowship.

== Charges ==

Joseph and Sonya Smith were each charged with four counts of [[murder]], five counts of first-degree cruelty to children, three counts of [[aggravated assault]] and two counts of [[false imprisonment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cobbsuperiorcourtclerk.org/courts/docAltiffFS.asp?tiffFile=T1961103&amp;pagesFile=9&amp;currPage=1&amp;cfn=20060080692 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725183918/http://www.cobbsuperiorcourtclerk.org/courts/docAltiffFS.asp?tiffFile=T1961103&amp;pagesFile=9&amp;currPage=1&amp;cfn=20060080692 |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The trial ==

=== Prosecution ===

Prosecutors in the trial said Joseph and Sonya Smith beat their son Josef, locked him in a wooden box and confined him to a closet for hours at a time before he died in October 2003.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;

=== Defense ===

The defense attorney for the Smiths said the injuries on the boy's body did not cause the boy's death and that the medical examiner did not perform tests that would have cleared his clients.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt;

During the trial, the defense attorney pointed out that there was no DNA evidence to prove the boy was locked inside the wooden box as the prosecution claimed. The defense also said the closet that prosecutors accused the parents of locking the boy in had no wall to prevent him from going into his bedroom, because his father had been renovating the house.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt;

The defense claimed that the boy died from septic shock resulting from a severe staph infection. Within an hour of the boy's arrival at the Cobb County Hospital Emergency Room, his blood test result came back "Gram positive for Coagulase-Negative Staphylococcus" and showed a white blood cell count of 21.5 thou/uL (the normal range is between 3.4 and 9.5). He also had a high fever that the medical staff were able to reduce down to 102.5&amp;nbsp;°F. A CAT scan of the head indicated there was no bleeding, no hemorrhage, no concussion, and no skull fracture. A CAT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis all came back showing "no signs of acute and internal hemorrhage nor significant injury".&lt;ref&gt;http://thesmithsareinnocent.com/wordpress/?p=5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verdict and sentencing ===
The Smiths were found guilty by all 12 members of the jury on February 16, 2007 which coincidentally would have been Josef's 12th birthday. They were both found guilty on 11 counts: one count each of [[felony murder]], reckless conduct, false imprisonment; three counts of aggravated assault, and four counts of cruelty to children  (two specifically pertaining to glue sticks and others to unknown objects)

After being convicted, the Smiths were then sentenced on March 27, 2007 to life plus 30 years in prison, the maximum punishment, by Cobb County Superior Court Judge James Bodiford.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;  
At the sentencing hearing approximately two dozen supporters for the Smiths were in the courtroom, and several friends spoke on the couple's behalf, describing them as kind.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;

The judge called the letters of support for the Smiths "amazing," but said the supporters likely didn't have all the details.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;

==Appeal proceedings==

One of the church's leaders, said they still believe the Smiths are innocent and that the church would "... support the Smiths in any way possible".&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;  The Church is standing by the couple and helping fund their legal appeals and solicit donations for them on the Internet. Attorney,  Manubir Singh Arora, who represented the Smiths at trial will not be handling their appeal. He told reporters that he was surprised and impressed by the level of support the church had shown the couple. ''Frankly they've helped out a ton,'' Arora said. ''And while people may or may not agree with whatever their beliefs are or the weight loss issues, the fact someone is willing to stick it out with you during one of the worst cases and worst times shows they're decent people.''

The defendants did file a motion in Cobb county for new trial arguing the "ineffective assistance of counsel" of their defense lawyer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cobbsuperiorcourtclerk.org/courts/docAltiffFS.asp?tiffFile=T3021189&amp;pagesFile=8&amp;currPage=1&amp;cfn=20090069611 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725183923/http://www.cobbsuperiorcourtclerk.org/courts/docAltiffFS.asp?tiffFile=T3021189&amp;pagesFile=8&amp;currPage=1&amp;cfn=20090069611 |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but that was denied on Oct 8, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cobbsuperiorcourtclerk.org/courts/docAltiffFS.asp?tiffFile=T3168399&amp;pagesFile=2&amp;currPage=1&amp;cfn=20090133713&amp;blocked=N |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725183849/http://www.cobbsuperiorcourtclerk.org/courts/docAltiffFS.asp?tiffFile=T3168399&amp;pagesFile=2&amp;currPage=1&amp;cfn=20090133713&amp;blocked=N |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An appeal was then brought to the Supreme Court of Georgia.  This appeal was denied on Nov 8, 2010 when the Supreme Court of Georgia on a 5-2 vote upheld the murder convictions and life prison sentences given to both Joseph and Sonya Smith.  The dissenting opinions cited improper conduct of the trial judge for allowing unfair and potentially prejudicial "theatrics" by the prosecution to gain an outcome based on passion rather than on the facts of the case.  They also cited inadequate jury instructions and definitions for some of the specific charges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gasupreme.us/sc-op/op_summaries/nov_8.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gasupreme.us/sc-op/pdf/s10a1281.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116163834/http://www.gasupreme.us/sc-op/pdf/s10a1281.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A petition was filed on Feb 7, 2011 with the United States Supreme Court&lt;ref name="supremecourt.gov"&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1093.htm&lt;/ref&gt; asking the Supreme Court to review the decisions made in the lower courts.

'''''Ha v New South Wales'''''&lt;ref name="Ha v NSW"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|34|1997|litigants=Ha v NSW |parallelcite=(1997) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 465 |date=5 August 1997 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[High Court of Australia]] case that dealt with [[Section 90 of the Constitution of Australia|section 90]] of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], which prohibits States from levying [[excise]].

==Facts==
The plaintiffs were charged under the ''Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) Act 1987'' (NSW) with selling tobacco in [[New South Wales]] without a licence. The Act provided for a licence fee, which consisted of a fixed amount, plus an amount calculated by reference to the value of tobacco sold during the 'relevant period'. The 'relevant period' was defined as 'the month commencing 2 months before the commencement of the month in which the licence expires'. The plaintiffs argued that the licence fee imposed by the Act was an excise and hence invalid due to section 90 of the Constitution.

==Decision==
A slim majority of the Court (Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ) ruled in favour of the plaintiffs, adopting the broad view of an excise per ''[[Matthews v Chicory Marketing Board (Vic)]]''.&lt;ref name="Matthews v Chicory"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|38|1938|litigants=[[Matthews v Chicory Marketing Board (Vic)]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/38.pdf (1938) 80 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 263] |date=9 August 1938 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They ruled an excise was a tax on sale, production and manufacture of goods prior to consumption, applying to goods whether produced locally or not. Excises could apply to any step in dealing with the goods. The Court viewed the scheme as purely about revenue raising without a discernible regulatory element, giving it the appearance of a tax. Under this broad view, the 'licence fee' imposed by the state government was in fact an excise, which Australian states are constitutionally barred from imposing.

The Court distinguished the decision from the earlier franchise fee cases (''[[Dennis Hotels Pty Ltd v Victoria]]'',&lt;ref name="Dennis"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1960|litigants=[[Dennis Hotels Pty Ltd v Victoria]] |parallelcite=(1960) 104 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 529 |date=26 February 1960 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Dickenson's Arcade Pty Ltd v Tasmania]]'' &lt;ref name="Dickenson's Arcade"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|9|1974|litigants=[[Dickenson's Arcade Pty Ltd v Tasmania]] |parallelcite=(1974) 130 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 177 |date=1 April 1974 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) because the period of backdating (two months instead of six) and the backdating mechanism were sufficiently different.

''Ha'' also featured a strong dissent, with the minority of the Court (Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) adopting the traditional narrow view of an excise. They rejected the ''[[Parton v Milk Board (Vic)]]'' excise definition.&lt;ref name="Parton v Milk Board"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|67|1949|litigants=[[Parton v Milk Board (Vic)]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/67.pdf (1949) 80 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 229] |date=21 December 1949 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The minority saw an excise as specifically a tax on the local manufacture or production of goods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4541">An '''idiopathic disease''' is any [[disease]] with an unknown cause or mechanism of apparent [[wikt:spontaneous|spontaneous]] origin.&lt;ref name=MLP&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Idiopathic| title =  Concise Medical Dictionary |edition=8th | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199557141.001.0001/acref-9780199557141-e-4863?rskey=EVJW8h&amp;result=5297 | accessdate = 2014-01-18| doi = 10.1093/acref/9780199557141.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἴδιος ''idios'' "one's own" and πάθος ''pathos'' "suffering", ''idiopathy'' means approximately "a disease of its own kind". For some medical conditions, one or more causes are somewhat understood, but in a certain percentage of people with the condition, the cause may not be readily apparent or characterized. In these cases, the origin of the condition is said to be '''idiopathic'''. With some other medical conditions, the root cause for a large percentage of all cases have not been established—for example, [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]] or [[ankylosing spondylitis]]; the majority of these cases are deemed idiopathic.&lt;ref name=Daskalakis_2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daskalakis N, Winn M |title=Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis |journal=Cell Mol Life Sci |volume=63 |issue=21 |pages=2506–11 |year=2006 |pmid=16952054 |doi=10.1007/s00018-006-6171-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; With other conditions, idiopathic cases account for only a small percentage (for example, [[pulmonary fibrosis]]).&lt;ref name=MLP2&gt;{{cite web | title = Medical Encyclopedia: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis | work = MedlinePlus| url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000069.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[medicine|medical science]] improve the study of causes of diseases and the classification of diseases; thus, regarding any particular condition or disease, as more root causes are discovered, and as events that seemed spontaneous have their origins revealed, the percentage of cases designated as idiopathic decreases.

The word '''''essential''''' is sometimes [[synonym]]ous with ''idiopathic'' (as in [[essential hypertension]], [[essential thrombocythemia]], and [[essential tremor]]) and the same is true of '''''primary''''' (as in [[primary biliary cholangitis]], or ''primary amenorrhea''), with the latter term being used in such cases to contrast with ''secondary'' in the sense of "secondary to [i.e., caused by] some other condition." Another, less common synonym is '''''agnogenic''''' (''agno-'', "unknown" + ''-gen'', "cause" + ''-ic''). The word ''[[cryptogenic disease|cryptogenic]]'' (''[[wikt:crypto-|crypto-]]'', "hidden" + ''-gen'', "cause" + ''-ic'') has a [[word sense|sense]] that is synonymous with ''idiopathic''&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=cryptogenic |work=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://dorlands.com/ |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a sense that is contradistinguished from it.

Some disease classifications prefer the use of the synonymous term '''cryptogenic disease''' as in cryptogenic stroke,&lt;ref name="Ahmad"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahmad|first1=Y|last2=Howard|first2=JP|last3=Arnold|first3=A|last4=Shin|first4=MS|last5=Cook|first5=C|last6=Petraco|first6=R|last7=Demir|first7=O|last8=Williams|first8=L|last9=Iglesias|first9=JF|last10=Sutaria|first10=N|last11=Malik|first11=I|last12=Davies|first12=J|last13=Mayet|first13=J|last14=Francis|first14=D|last15=Sen|first15=S|title=Patent foramen ovale closure vs. medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials|journal=European Heart Journal|volume=39|issue=18|pages=1638–1649|date=24 March 2018|doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehy121|pmid=29590333|pmc=5946888}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some forms of [[epilepsy]]. The use of cryptogenic is also sometimes reserved for cases where the cause is presumed to be simple and which will be found in the future.

Some [[birth defect|congenital conditions]] are idiopathic, and sometimes the word ''congenital'' is used synonymously with ''idiopathic''; but careful usage prefers to reserve the word ''congenital'' for conditions to which the literal sense of the word applies (that is, those whose pathophysiology has existed since the [[infant|neonatal]] period).

An '''inborn error of steroid metabolism''' is an [[inborn error of metabolism]] due to defects in [[steroid metabolism]].
==Types==
A variety of [[medical condition|condition]]s of abnormal [[steroidogenesis]] exist due to [[genetic mutation]]s in the [[steroidogenic enzyme]]s involved in the process, of which include:

===Generalized===
* [[Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia|20,22-Desmolase (P450scc) deficiency]]: blocks production of all [[steroid hormone]]s from [[cholesterol]]
* [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency|3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 deficiency]]: impairs [[progestogen]] and [[androgen]] metabolism; prevents the synthesis of [[estrogen]]s, [[glucocorticoid]]s, and [[mineralocorticoid]]s; causes androgen deficiency in males and androgen excess in females
* [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17α-hydroxylase deficiency|Combined 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency]]: impairs progestogen metabolism; prevents androgen, estrogen, and glucocorticoid synthesis; causes mineralocorticoid excess
* [[Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency]]: prevents production of numerous but not all [[sex steroid]]s, as well as other [[metabolic reaction]]s

===Androgen- and estrogen-specific===
* [[Isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency]]: prevents androgen and estrogen synthesis
** [[Cytochrome b5 deficiency|Cytochrome b&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency]]: subtype of isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency; additionally results in elevated [[methemoglobin]] and/or [[methemoglobinemia]]
* [[17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency]]: impairs androgen and estrogen metabolism; results in androgen deficiency in males and androgen excess and estrogen deficiency in females
* [[5α-Reductase 2 deficiency]]: prevents the conversion of [[testosterone]] to [[dihydrotestosterone]]; causes androgen deficiency in males
* [[Aromatase deficiency]]: prevents estrogen synthesis; causes androgen excess in females
* [[Aromatase excess syndrome|Aromatase excess]]: causes excessive conversion of androgens to estrogens; results in estrogen excess in both sexes and androgen deficiency in males

===Glucocorticoid- and mineralocorticoid-specific===
* [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency|21-Hydroxylase deficiency]]: prevents glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis; causes androgen excess in females
* [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency|11β-Hydroxylase 1 deficiency]]: impairs glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid metabolism; causes glucocorticoid deficiency and mineralocorticoid excess as well as androgen excess in females
* [[Apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome|11β-Hydroxylase 2 deficiency]]: impairs corticosteroid metabolism; results in excessive mineralocorticoid activity
* [[18-Hydroxylase deficiency]]: prevents mineralocorticoid synthesis; results in mineralocorticoid deficiency
* [[Glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism|18-Hydroxylase overactivity]]: impairs mineralocorticoid metabolism; results in mineralocorticoid excess

===Miscellaneous===
In addition, several conditions of abnormal steroidogenesis due to genetic mutations in ''[[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s'', as opposed to enzymes, also exist, including:

* [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone insensitivity|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) insensitivity]]: prevents synthesis of sex steroids by the gonads in both sexes
* [[Follicle-stimulating hormone insensitivity|Follicle-stimulating (FSH) hormone insensitivity]]: prevents synthesis of sex steroids by the gonads in females; merely causes problems with fertility in males
* [[Leydig cell hypoplasia|Luteinizing hormone (LH) insensitivity]]: prevents synthesis of sex steroids by the gonads in males; merely causes problems with fertility in females
* [[Familial male-limited precocious puberty|Luteinizing hormone (LH) oversensitivity]]: causes androgen excess in males, resulting in precocious puberty; females are asymptomatic

No activating mutations of the GnRH receptor in humans have been described in the [[medical literature]],&lt;ref name="pmid14714589"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karges B, Karges W, de Roux N | title = Clinical and molecular genetics of the human GnRH receptor | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 523–30 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14714589 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmg040| url = http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14714589}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only one of the FSH receptor has been described, which presented as asymptomatic.&lt;ref name="NieschlagBehre2009"&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Eberhard Nieschlag | author2 = Hermann M.

'''Initiative 136''' is a citizen's movement in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]], which was organized in 2011 in opposition to [[water privatization|privatization]] of Thessaloniki's public water and sewage company, [[EYATH]].&lt;ref name="On the commons"/&gt; 

==New water services management==
The movement proposes a new type of water services management that is neither [[public service|state-run]] nor [[private ownership|private]], but rather operates on the principles of [[cooperative|cooperativism]] and conceives water as a [[commons]]. At the heart of the Initiative's plan is the creation of local water cooperatives in all of the metropolitan area's municipalities and districts. The cooperatives will allow  participation of water users in decision making regarding water tariffs and investment, under the principle of "one water meter equals one vote".&lt;ref name="On the commons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onthecommons.org/magazine/greeks-stand-protect-their-water-privatization |title=Greeks Stand Up to Protect Their Water From Privatization |publisher=On the Commons |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Union of cooperatives==
The union of all the cooperatives will constitute a new company that, according to its statute, will have the goal of managing Thessaloniki's water services in a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] manner and ensure [[water quality]], [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] control, social justice, access to water for all and protection of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.136.gr |script-title=el:Κίνηση 136 &amp;#124; Το νερό είναι κοινωνικό αγαθό! |publisher=136.gr |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt; The union of cooperatives will participate in the [[public tender]] for the acquisition of EYATH announced by the Greek government for 2013.

'''Investor-state dispute settlement''' ('''ISDS''') or '''investment court system''' ('''ICS''') is a system through which investors can sue countries for alleged discriminatory practices. ISDS is an instrument of [[public international law]] and provisions are contained in a number of [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]], in certain international [[trade treaty|trade treaties]], such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] (chapter 11), and the proposed [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|TPP]] (chapter 9) and [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]] (sections 3 and 4) agreements. ISDS is also found in [[international investment agreement]]s, such as the [[Energy Charter Treaty]]. If an investor from one country (the "home state") invests in another country (the "host state"), both of which have agreed to ISDS, and the host state violates the rights granted to the investor under the treaty, then that investor may bring the matter before an [[arbitral tribunal]].

While ISDS is often associated with [[international arbitration]] under the rules of ICSID (the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] of the [[World Bank]]), it often takes place under the auspices of international arbitral tribunals governed by different rules or institutions, such as the [[London Court of International Arbitration]], the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre]] or the [[UNCITRAL]] Arbitration Rules.

== Foreign investment protection ==
=== Historical development ===
Under [[customary international law]] a state can vindicate injury caused to its nation by the host state by exercising [[diplomatic protection]], which may include [[retorsion]] and/or [[reprisals]]. In addition to diplomatic protection and to avoid having to resort to coercive means, states can and do establish ad hoc commissions and [[arbitral tribunal]]s to adjudicate claims involving treatment of foreign nationals and their property by the Host State ("state-state-dispute-settlement", SSDS). Notable examples of this practice are the [[Jay Treaty]] commissions, the [[Iran–United States Claims Tribunal]] and the [[American-Mexican Claims Commission]].&lt;ref name="NewcombeParadell" /&gt; However, these treaties were limited to the treatment of foreign investors during a past period of time, whereas modern ISDS allows investors to make claims against states in general and on a prospective basis.

=== Modern practice ===
Currently, the legal protection of [[Foreign Direct Investment]] under [[public international law]] is guaranteed by a network of more than 2750 [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]] (BITs), Multilateral Investment Treaties, most notably the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] and number of Free Trade Agreements such as [[NAFTA]] containing a chapter on investment protection. Most of these treaties were signed by states in the late 1980s and early 1990s, before the current explosion of investor claims under the treaties began in the late 1990s.

The majority of these legal instruments provides foreign investors with a substantive legal protection (including the right to "fair and equitable treatment", "full protection and security", "free transfer of means" and the right not to be directly or indirectly expropriated without full compensation) and access to ISDS for redress against Host States for breaches of such protection. Some of these standards are framed in vague terms, given extensive discretion to arbitrators in their interpretation and application. The overall number of known cases reached over 500 in 2012. Of these, 244 were concluded, of which approximately 42% were decided in favour of the Host State and approximately 31% in favour of the investor. Approximately 27% of the cases were settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/webdiaepcb2013d3_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Recent Developments in Investor-State Disputes|publisher=Unctad.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NAFTA logo.png|right|150px|thumb|Chapter 11 of [[NAFTA]] includes an Investor-State provision.]]

Notably, only foreign investors can sue states under investment treaties, because states are the parties to the treaty, and only states can be held liable to pay damages for breach of the treaty. States have no corresponding right to bring an original claim against a foreign investor under such treaties, again because investors are not parties to the treaty and therefore cannot be in breach of it. Thus, a decision in favour of the State means that the state has not been ordered to pay compensation, not that it has received any compensation from the investor, although costs can be awarded against the investor. A state cannot "win" in ISDS in the manner of a foreign investor - a state which wishes to sue a foreign investor does so through its own domestic courts, without the need for a treaty.

ISDS cannot overturn local laws (unlike the [[World Trade Organization]]) which violate trade agreements,&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefings/assessing-trans-pacific-partnership-volume-1-market-access-and-sectoral|title=Assessing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Volume 1: Market Access and Sectoral Issues {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e|title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can grant monetary damages to investors adversely affected by such laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid|title=The obscure legal system that lets corporations sue countries|date=10 June 2015|publisher=The Guardian|author=Claire Provost and Matt Kennard|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]], ISDS requires specific treaty violations, and does not allow corporations to sue solely over "lost profits".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/blog/2015/march/isds-important-questions-and-answers|title=ISDS: Important Questions and Answers {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|access-date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such violations may be difficult to foresee, and the threat of exorbitant fines may cause a [[chilling effect]] which halts regulation or legislation in the public interest (e.g. human health and environmental protection).&lt;ref name="SCint"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/933590566|title=Shadow courts : the tribunals that rule global trade|last=Sweetland,|first=Edwards, Haley|publisher=Colombia Global Reports|year=2016|isbn=9780997126402|location=|pages=Chapter: Introduction|oclc=933590566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also state that treaties are written so that any legislation causing lost profits is per definition a treaty violation, rendering the argument null that only treaty violations are subject to ISDS.&lt;ref name="SCint"/&gt;

==== NAFTA Chapter 11 ====
{{main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}
A notable example of ISDS, which has been in existence for two decades now, is Chapter 11 of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). NAFTA Chapter 11 allows investors of one NAFTA party (Canada, United States or Mexico) to bring claims directly against the government of another NAFTA party before an international [[arbitral tribunal]]. Because NAFTA Article 1121 waives the local remedies rule, investors are not required to exhaust local remedies before filing Chapter 11 claims. While this fact has been amply criticized in public, proponents of ISDS tend to point out that speedy dispute resolution through ISDS is critical in modern economic environments and would be defeated by adding several instances of local remedies. On the other hand, there is no other situation in international law where a private party can sue a state without showing that the state's domestic courts are not independent or reliable. The removal of the customary duty to exhaust local remedies, where they are reasonably available, is claimed to be a factor in the explosion of investment treaty claims since the late 1990s, although a more obvious explanation is the explosion in the number of bilateral free trade agreements since the breakdown of the multilateral WTO Doha round in the mid 2000s.

Investors may initiate an arbitration against the NAFTA Party under the Arbitration Rules of the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] ("UNCITRAL Rules") or under the Rules of the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] ("ICSID Rules"). NAFTA Chapter 11 was the first instance of an ISDS provision receiving widespread public attention, especially in the United States in the wake of the [[Methanex]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/s/l/c5818.htm|title=Methanex Corp. v. United States of America|publisher=State.gov|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TTIP ===
Resistance from the EU side to the US proposal to include an ISDS clause in the draft [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] treaty was such as to cause this element to be abandoned in September 2015. In its place, the [[European Commission]] proposed an investment court system (ICS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/130297|title=EU proposes new trade court with US|last=Nielsen|first=Nikolaj|date=16 September 2015|website=EUobserver|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/eu-unit/Global/eu-unit/reports-briefings/2016/2016_02_11_Greenpeace%20Position%20Paper%20ICS_Final.pdf|title=From ISDS to ICS: A Leopard Can't Change Its Spots|date=11 February 2016|publisher=Greenpeace Position Paper|page=1|access-date=23 February 2016|author=Greenpeace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5651_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Not long afterwards, ICS was declared illegal by the German Association of Magistrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/132142|title=TTIP investor court illegal, say German judges|last=Nielsen|first=Nikolaj|date=4 February 2016|website=EUobserver|access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the Commission dismissed the magistrates' judgement as based on a misunderstanding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/132295|title=EU defends TTIP investor court after German backlash|last=Nielsen|first=Nikolaj|date=17 February 2016|website=EUobserver|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, the United States wants ISDS reinstated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

|quote= If you wanted to convince the public that international trade agreements are a way to let multinational companies get rich at the expense of ordinary people, this is what you would do: give foreign firms a special right to apply to a secretive tribunal of highly paid corporate lawyers for compensation whenever a government passes a law to, say, discourage smoking, protect the environment or prevent a nuclear catastrophe. Yet that is precisely what thousands of trade and investment treaties over the past half century have done, through a process known as 'investor-state dispute settlement', or ISDS.&lt;ref name = "Economist ISDS 2014"&gt;{{Cite web |title= The arbitration game |url= https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623756-governments-are-souring-treaties-protect-foreign-investors-arbitration |date= 14 October 2014 |website= economist.com |accessdate= 6 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of ISDS argue that governments retain their regulatory ability, if the agreements in question specify that regulations protecting health, the environment, labour rights and human rights are allowed. The [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] challenges the notion that ISDS challenges "the sovereign ability of governments impose any measure they wish to protect labor rights, the environment, or other issues of public welfare".&lt;ref name=":152"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/blog/2015/march/isds-important-questions-and-answers|title=ISDS: Important Questions and Answers {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|access-date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Bar Association|International Bar Association (IBA)]] mirrors these sentiments, noting that "while investment treaties limit states’ ability to inflict arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, they do not limit (and, in fact, expressly safeguard) a state’s sovereign right to regulate in the public interest in a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory manner."&lt;ref name=":272"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e|title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White House Office|White House]] notes that investment protections are a component of more than 3,000 trade agreements, the vast majority of which have some form of neutral arbitration.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/26/investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds-questions-and-answers|title=Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) Questions and Answers|date=26 February 2015|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is party to at least 50 such agreements, has only faced 13 ISDS cases and never lost an ISDS case.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

The [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] claims that ISDS provisions are necessary, as they boost investment: "empirical evidence has shown that treaties including these provisions have a positive effect on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows between signatory countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy-watch/what-do-data-say-about-relationship-between-investor-state|title=What Do the Data Say about the Relationship between Investor-State Dispute Settlement Provisions and FDI? {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PIIE challenges the claim that ISDS "arbitrators lack integrity", noting that arbitrators take an oath of impartiality and both sides of a case choose arbitrators.&lt;ref name=":232"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefings/assessing-trans-pacific-partnership-volume-1-market-access-and-sectoral|title=Assessing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Volume 1: Market Access and Sectoral Issues {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2016 op-ed against the TPP, Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] used the example of a French company suing Egypt because Egypt raised its minimum wage as an argument against the ISDS provisions of the TPP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Washington Post editorial board has however challenged this characterization of the case, noting that "[[Veolia]] of France, a waste management company, invoked ISDS to enforce a contract with the government of [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], that it says required compensation if costs increased; the company maintains that the wage increases triggered this provision. Incidentally, Veolia was working with Alexandria on a [[World Bank]]-supported project to reduce greenhouse gases, not some corporate plot to exploit the people. The case — which would result, at most, in a monetary award to Veolia, not the overthrow of the minimum wage — remains in litigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-buy-the-trade-deal-alarmism/2015/03/11/41575fee-c1d5-11e4-9271-610273846239_story.html|title=Don’t buy the trade deal alarmism|last=Board|first=Editorial|date=11 March 2015|access-date=1 August 2016|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Bar Association|International Bar Association (IBA)]], states have won a higher percentage of ISDS cases than investors, and that around one-third of all cases end in settlement.&lt;ref name=":273"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e|title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claimant investors, when successful, recover on average less than half of what the amounts claimed.&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA notes that "only 8 per cent of ISDS proceedings are commenced by very large multinational corporations."&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA challenges the notion that ISDS is biased against developing countries, noting that there is "no correlation between the success rates of claims against states and their income levels or development status."&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA notes that ISDS is necessary even in countries with sophisticated domestic legal systems because those domestic courts rule according to domestic laws, not international law.&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA notes that "increasingly, awards require the losing party to pay arbitration costs and legal fees to the winning party", which deters investors from initiating unmeritorious cases.&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt;

A 2017 study found that the success rates of investors in investor-state disputes has sharply fallen over time because most legal challenges today seek compensation for regulation implemented by democracies, not expropriation by non-democracies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelc|first=Krzysztof J.|date=31 May 2017|title=What Explains the Low Success Rate of Investor-State Disputes?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/what-explains-the-low-success-rate-of-investorstate-disputes/7AE6CEA67B5A0FADAE3B11703C4A1442|journal=International Organization|pages=1–25|doi=10.1017/S0020818317000212|issn=0020-8183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the study argues that the likely goal of investors is not to obtain compensation through ISDS, but to impose costs on governments contemplating regulations and therefore deter the regulatory ambitions of governments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Transparency ===
Opponents of ISDS argue that arbitrations are sometimes carried out in secret by trade lawyers who do not enjoy the typical safeguards of judicial independence and procedural fairness, who earn income only if a case is brought and proceeds, and who are not accountable to the public or required to take into account broader constitutional and international law human rights norms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://justinvestment.org/2011/05/oecd-document-discusses-investor-state-dispute-settlement/ Van Harten, Gus. "OECD Document Discusses Investor State Dispute Settlement".] Accessed: 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] agrees "that secrecy has gone too far" in many ISDS cases, but notes that agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership did ensure greater transparency in ISDS.&lt;ref name=":232" /&gt; Proponents of ISDS point out that confidentiality is a standard feature of all [[arbitration]] and one that enables a constructive, de-politicized and fact-oriented atmosphere of dispute resolution. On the other hand, such traditional confidentiality is limited to disputes that affect the parties in question and not the broader public. Also, most ICSID awards, although confidential, are de facto published by consent of the parties. However, many awards under other arbitration rules are not public and, in the case of investor-arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce, there is a requirement for blanket confidentiality for all aspects of a case.

It is further pointed out that judges are not elected in most countries outside the US, so that "public accountability of judges" may not be considered a standard of [[public international law]]. In any event, they say, the qualification of ISDS arbitrators matches or exceeds the qualification of most court judges.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In response, critics make the point that any judge, whether domestic or international, who is part of a legal system not shown to be systematically biased or unreliable, has a greater claim to independence than an arbitrator because they are insulated from conflicts of interest that arise when arbitrators work on the side as lawyers, and is assigned cases in an objective manner rather than by the discretion of a disputing party or an executive official. Arbitrators are appointed by both parties at dispute, so such conflicts of interest may arise on both sides.

While ISDS has traditionally been confidential as any other [[arbitration]], the general trend in the last decade has been to allow for more openness and transparency. On the other hand, there is still widespread confidentiality in the system.

Under Art. 29 of the U.S. Model-BIT of 2004, all documents pertaining to ISDS have to be made public and [[amicus curiae]] briefs are allowed. However, no investment treaty allows other parties who have an interest in the dispute, other than the claimant investor and respondent government, to obtain [[standing (law)|standing]] in the adjudicative process.

Under the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]], the tribunals shall, subject to the consent of the disputing parties, conduct hearings open to the public. The tribunal will make available to the public documents relating to the dispute such as the notice of intent, the notice of arbitration, pleadings, memorials, minutes or transcripts of the hearings of the tribunal, where available; orders, awards and decisions of the tribunal. In addition, third parties can and increasingly do participate in investor-state arbitration by submitting ''[[amicus curiae]]'' petitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partF-chap04.htm#r37 |title=ICSID, Arbitration Rules |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]]'s [[International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) is required by ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 22 to make public, information on the registration of all requests for arbitration and to indicate in due course the date and method of the termination of each proceeding. It also publishes the vast majority of awards with the consent of the parties. If the parties do not consent, ICSID publishes excerpts showing the tribunal's reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;actionVal=ShowHome&amp;pageName=Cases_Home |title=International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID Cases |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICSID website has published awards for most completed arbitrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;reqFrom=Main&amp;actionVal=OnlineAward |title=International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, View Decisions and Awards |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decisions in investor-state arbitrations outside of ICSID are also publicly available online.

On 1 April 2014, the [[UNCITRAL]] Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration entered into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/rules-on-transparency/Rules-on-Transparency-E.pdf|format=PDF|title=UNCITRAL : Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration|publisher=Uncitral.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3 foresees a general duty to publish all documents pertaining to an ISDS-procedure under UNCITRAL Rules, where the treaty establishing the ISDS-mechanism has been concluded after 1 April 2014 or where the parties so consent, subject to certain overwhelming confidentiality interests listed in Article 7. Original proposals to make all UNCITRAL arbitration under investment treaties public were not adopted after opposition by some states and by representatives of the arbitration industry who participated in the UNCITRAL working group negotiations as state representatives.

On 17 March 2015, the United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration ('Mauritius Convention') was opened for signatures in Port Louis, Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/2014Transparency_Convention.html|title=2014 - UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration|work=uncitral.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mauritius Convention will render the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor State Arbitration also applicable to disputes arising out of investment treaties that were concluded prior to 1 April 2014 if both parties to the investment treaty are also party to the Mauritius Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Article 3, Mauritius Convention http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/transparency-convention/Transparency-Convention-e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention has not yet entered into force since the three required ratifications have not yet been submitted.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/2014Transparency_Convention_status.html|title=Status|work=uncitral.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10 States have signed the Mauritius Convention so far.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"/&gt;

== Tribunals ==
Investment disputes can be initiated by corporations and natural persons and in almost all cases, investment tribunals are composed of three arbitrators (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). As in most [[arbitration]]s, one is appointed by the investor, one by the state, and the third is usually chosen by agreement between the parties or their appointed arbitrators or selected by the appointing authority, depending on the procedural rules applicable to the dispute. If the parties do not agree who to appoint, this power is assigned to executive officials usually at the World Bank, the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, or a private chamber of commerce.

Other individuals cannot initiate a claim against a state under an investment treaty. Also, no individual or state can initiate a claim against a foreign investor under an investment treaty. This has led to criticisms that investor-state arbitration is not balanced and that it favours the "haves" over the "have nots" by giving foreign investors, especially major companies, access to a special tribunal outside any court. While the arbitration process itself does not provide explicitly privileged access for larger investors over individuals or SMEs, the costs of ISDS, as in any court or arbitration system, tend to be off-putting for smaller claimants.

== Examples ==
According to a May 2011 working paper, "In terms of wins and losses, [the] U.S. has never lost a case as the respondent country. U.S. investors have won 15 cases, lost 22 cases and settled 14 cases. In terms of performance with respect to developing countries, U.S. investors have won 14 cases and lost 17."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/179093/2/11-01TreatyArbitrationReappraisal.pdf|title=Working Paper No. 11-01: Investment Treaty Arbitration and Developing Countries: A Re-Appraisal|authors=Kevin P.

=== Dismissed cases ===

; ''KT Asia Investment Group v. Kazakhstan''

: The claimant (company incorporated in Holland) was a shell company owned by Kazakh national (Mr. Ablyazov). It owned shares in BTA Bank, which the claimant alleged were nationalized by the respondent (Kazakhstan). The state position was that as owned by a Kazakh national the claimant was not eligible for investment protection under the Dutch-Kazakh BIT. This argument was dismissed by the Arbitrage. The Kazakh state than alleged that it didn’t nationalize the bank, but it bailed it out (wiping out the shares’ value in the process). The latter was due to the embezzlement of depositors’ trust (and funds) by Mr. Ablyazov. Investigating the matter the Arbitrage reached the conclusion that the investment doesn’t meet the Salini test, thus it is not protected under the BIT. As a result the Arbitrage decided it has no jurisdiction to decide the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8 http://icsidfiles.worldbank.org/icsid/ICSIDBLOBS/OnlineAwards/C620/DC3912_En.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prospects for ISDS ==
After ISDS claims by investors sharply increased starting in the late 1990s, ISDS came under greater public attention and criticism. This was true for the NAFTA claims against the United States in the late 1990s, for Germany in the wake of the [[Vattenfall]] claims in the late 2000s and also for Australia in 2011, when confronted with the Philip Morris claim.&lt;ref name=economist-20141011&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623756-governments-are-souring-treaties-protect-foreign-investors-arbitration |title=Investor-state dispute settlement - The arbitration game |newspaper=The Economist |date=11 October 2014 |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Australian government announced that it would discontinue the practice of seeking inclusion of investor state dispute settlement provisions in trade agreements with developing countries. It stated that it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...supports the principle of national treatment — that foreign and domestic businesses are treated equally under the law. However, the Government does not support provisions that would confer greater legal rights on foreign businesses than those available to domestic businesses. Nor will the Government support provisions that would constrain the ability of Australian governments to make laws on social, environmental and economic matters in circumstances where those laws do not discriminate between domestic and foreign businesses. The Government has not and will not accept provisions that limit its capacity to put health warnings or plain packaging requirements on tobacco products or its ability to continue the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme... In the past, Australian Governments have sought the inclusion of investor-state dispute resolution procedures in trade agreements with developing countries at the behest of Australian businesses. The Gillard Government will discontinue this practice. If Australian businesses are concerned about sovereign risk in Australian trading partner countries, they will need to make their own assessments about whether they want to commit to investing in those countries... Foreign businesses investing in Australia will be entitled to the same legal protections as domestic businesses but the Gillard Government will not confer greater rights on foreign businesses through investor-state dispute resolution provisions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acci.asn.au/getattachment/b9d3cfae-fc0c-4c2a-a3df-3f58228daf6d/Gillard-Government-Trade-Policy-Statement.aspx "Trade Policy Statement", Australian Government.] Accessed: 5 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This statement is a reaction to Philip Morris' ISDS claim under [[UNCITRAL]] rules to challenge Australian tobacco Advertising Restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.gov.au/internationalrelations/internationallaw/pages/tobaccoplainpackaging.aspx|title=Tobacco plain packaging—investor-state arbitration|publisher=Ag.gov.au|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013,{{Update inline|date=April 2017}} Australia had not terminated any bilateral investment treaties allowing for ISDS. Even if it were to do so, most such treaties foresee post-termination-protection for many years after the termination has become effective. In any event, since the election of the conservative Coalition Government in 2013, the Government has entered into free trade agreements (such as the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, Ch 9 section B) that include ISDS.&lt;ref&gt;http://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/chafta/Pages/australia-china-fta.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative way ahead may be the preservation of investor protection under [[public international law]], including ISDS, but with more concern for transparency and the balancing of economic and non-economic interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/130710/LDM_BRI(2014)130710_REV2_EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) : State of play and prospects for reform|publisher=Europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted [[#Debates|above]], the [[European Commission]] proposed September 2015) an 'Investment Court System' to replace ISDS clauses (notably in the draft TTIP), with the scope for investor challenge much reduced and with 'highly skilled judges' rather than arbitrators used to determine cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Commission proposes new Investment Court System for TTIP and other EU trade and investment negotiations | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5651_en.htm | work = The European Commission| date = 16 September 2015 | accessdate = 25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this vein, [[Karel De Gucht]], the [[European Commissioner for Trade|EU commissioner]] in charge of negotiating [[International Investment Agreement]]s declared on 18 December 2014 that future agreements shall become more transparent, shall "fully enshrine democratic prerogatives" and "explicitly state that legitimate government public policy decisions – on issues such as the balance between public and private provision of healthcare or "the European ban on chicken carcasses washed with chlorine" – cannot be over-ridden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/18/wrong-george-monbiot-nothing-secret-eu-trade-deal|title=You're wrong, George Monbiot – there is nothing secret about this EU trade deal|author=Karel De Gucht|work=the Guardian|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced to "crack down on companies using legal technicalities to build frivolous cases against governments", to "open up investment tribunals to public scrutiny – documents will be public and interested parties, including NGOs, will be able to make submissions". Also, he said, the EU "will eliminate any conflicts of interest – the arbitrators who decide on EU cases must be above suspicion". However, insisting equally on the advantages of such investment protection agreements, he states along that [they] "protect job-creating investment from discrimination and unfair treatment" and that "the task here is to find the right balance between preventing abuse and protecting investments".

Current controversies over ISDS appear driven by attempts to expand its scope to new countries and, especially, to relations between developed countries with mature court systems and democratic governments.

In 2014, several members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] expressed opposition to inclusion of ISDS in the proposed [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP) between the United States and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Drake | first = Celeste | title = Powerful Members of Congress Oppose Special 'Corporate Court' Rights for European Firms | publisher = [[AFL–CIO]] | date = 18 December 2014 | url = http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Political-Action-Legislation/Powerful-Members-of-Congress-Oppose-Special-Corporate-Court-Rights-for-European-Firms | accessdate = 2014-12-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20141221072048/http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Political-Action-Legislation/Powerful-Members-of-Congress-Oppose-Special-Corporate-Court-Rights-for-European-Firms | archivedate = 21 December 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, faced with opposition to ISDS in several European countries, the European Parliament adopted a resolution requiring any new dispute settlement scheme included in TTIP "must be replaced by a new public and transparent system of investment protection, in which private interests cannot undermine public policy and which is subject to public law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Euractiv: European Parliament backs TTIP, rejects ISDS|url = http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/european-parliament-backs-ttip-rejects-isds-316142|accessdate = 2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Commission's 2015 proposal in response is noted [[#Debates|above]]).

South Africa has stated it will withdraw from treaties with ISDS clauses, and India is also considering such a position. Indonesia plans to let treaties with ISDS clauses lapse when they need renewal. Brazil has refused any treaty with ISDS clauses.&lt;ref name="economist-20141011" /&gt;

In 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that "The arbitration clause in the Agreement between the Netherlands and Slovakia on the protection of investments is not compatible with EU law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2018-03/cp180026en.pdf|title=Judgment in Case C-284/16 - Slowakische Republik v Achmea BV|author=Court of Justice of the European Union|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling could imply that any similar arbitration tribunal considering corporate sovereignty cases would also be illegal under EU law.

The '''Jewish General Hospital''' ('''JGH'''; {{lang-fr|Hôpital général juif}}), known officially as the '''Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital''' ({{lang-fr|Hôpital général juif Sir Mortimer B. Davis}}) since 1978, is an acute-care  [[teaching hospital]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. Affiliated with [[McGill University]], it has 637 beds.

==History==
The Jewish General Hospital, which opened its doors in 1934, was founded as a general hospital, open to all patients regardless of race, religion, language or ethnic background.  While part of the Quebec [[Medicare (Canada)|medicare]] system, and functionally bilingual in French and English, the hospital continues to be run chiefly by members of the Jewish community.

At his death in 1928, [[Mortimer Davis]] left most of his estate to be used for the construction of a Jewish public hospital that would bear his name. In 1969, the hospital opened the affiliated [[Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research]], one of the largest and most influential research centres in Canada.

Among many other medical innovations, in 1974, the JGH was one of the first hospitals in Canada to open a division of [[colorectal]] [[surgery]].  Among the famous alumni of the hospital is former head nurse Beverley Binder (née Rosen).

In 1978, fifty years after Davis's death, $10 million from his estate was donated to the Jewish General Hospital, which was then renamed the Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital.

==Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research==
The Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research (LDI) is the research arm of the Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital and has strong academic ties to McGill University.

Founded in 1969, the LDI has a roster of nearly 200 researchers, and it is an important North American biomedical research institute. LDI researchers have made major breakthroughs in the areas of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[aging]], [[cancer]], [[vascular disease]], [[epidemiology]], and psychosocial science.

The LDI currently supports four major research axes (or programs):

* [[Cancer]] (Segal Cancer Centre)
* [[Epidemiology]]
* Molecular and Regenerative Medicine (includes stem cells, haemovascular disease, aging and HIV/AIDS)
* Psychosocial Aspects of Disease

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18658">'''Kendra's Law''', effective since November 1999, is a [[New York State]] law concerning [[involuntary outpatient commitment]]. It grants judges the authority to issue orders that require people who meet certain criteria to regularly undergo psychiatric treatment. Failure to comply could result in commitment for up to 72 hours.  Kendra's Law does not mandate that patients be forced to take medication.

It was originally proposed by members of the National Alliance on Mental Illness,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nami.org/Content/ContentGroups/Policy/Updates/Involuntary_Commitment_And_Court-Ordered_Treatment.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; the Alliance on Mental Illness of New York State, and many local NAMI chapters throughout the state. They were concerned that laws were preventing individuals with serious mental illness from receiving care until after they became "dangerous to self or others". They felt the law should work to prevent violence, not require it.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} They viewed outpatient commitment as a less expensive, less restrictive and more humane alternative to inpatient commitment.

The members of NAMI, working with NYS Assemblywoman Elizabeth Connelly, NYC Department of Mental Health Commissioner, Dr. Luis Marcos, and Dr. Howard Telson were successful in getting a pilot outpatient commitment program started at [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]].

==Background==
In 1999, there was a series of incidents involving individuals with untreated mental illness becoming violent. In one assault in the [[New York City Subway]], Andrew Goldstein, then 29 and diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] but off medication, pushed [[Kendra Webdale]] into the path of an oncoming '''[[N (New York City Subway service)|N]]''' train at the [[23rd Street (BMT Broadway Line)|23rd Street]] station.&lt;ref name="Schapiro 2012"&gt;{{cite web | last=Schapiro | first=Rich | title=Horrifying subway homicide causes parents to relive daughter's death | website=NY Daily News | date=2012-12-05 | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/horrifying-subway-homicide-parents-relive-daughter-death-article-1.1213653 | accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law is named after her. Her family played a significant role in getting it passed. Subsequently, in a similar incident, Julio Perez, age 43, pushed Edgar Rivera in front of an uptown '''[[6 (New York City Subway service)|6]]''' train at [[51st Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|51st Street]].&lt;ref name="Jacobs 1999"&gt;{{cite web | last=Jacobs | first=Andrew | title=Subway Victim Says He Harbors No Anger | website=The New York Times | date=1999-06-03 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/03/nyregion/subway-victim-says-he-harbors-no-anger.html | accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera lost his legs and became a strong supporter of the law. Both Goldstein and Perez had been discharged by psychiatric facilities with little or no [[medication]]. Kendra's Law, introduced by Governor [[George E. Pataki]], was created as a response to these incidents.&lt;ref&gt;McMan's Depression and Bipolar Web, "Kendra's Law", [http://www.mcmanweb.com/article-66.htm http://www.mcmanweb.com/article-66.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the law was extended for 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;New York Civil Liberties Union, "State Lawmakers Extend Kendra's Law For 5 Years, Despite Concerns That It Targets Men Of Color" http://www.nyclu.org/aot_program_pr_062305.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these incidents, involuntary outpatient commitment moved from being a program to help the mentally ill to a program that could increase public safety. Public safety advocates joined advocates for the mentally ill in trying to take the successful Bellevue Pilot Program statewide. What was formerly known as involuntary outpatient commitment was re-christened as assisted outpatient treatment, in an attempt to communicate the positive intent of the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1294]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
Kendra's Law basically allows courts to order certain seriously mentally ill individuals to accept treatment as a condition for living in the community. The law is aimed at a small group who have a history of rehospitalization that is associated with going off medications.

In order to be admitted to Kendra's Law, individuals must meet the following criteria established in Section 9.60 of NYS Mental Health Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1284]&lt;/ref&gt; A patient may be ordered to obtain assisted outpatient treatment if the court finds that:
* the patient is eighteen years of age or older; and
* the patient is suffering from a mental illness; and
* the patient is unlikely to survive safely in the community without supervision, based on a clinical determination; and
* the patient has a history of lack of compliance with treatment for mental illness that has:
# at least twice within the last thirty-six months been a significant factor in necessitating hospitalization in a hospital, or receipt of services in a forensic or other mental health unit of a correctional facility or a local correctional facility, not including any period during which the person was hospitalized or incarcerated immediately preceding the filing of the petition or;
# resulted in one or more acts of serious violent behavior toward self or others or threats of, or attempts at, serious physical harm to self or others within the last forty-eight months, not including any period in which the person was hospitalized or incarcerated immediately preceding the filing of the petition; and
* the patient is, as a result of his or her mental illness, unlikely to voluntarily participate in the recommended treatment pursuant to the treatment plan; and
* in view of the patient's treatment history and current behavior, the patient is in need of assisted outpatient treatment in order to prevent a relapse or deterioration which would be likely to result in serious harm to the patient or others as defined in section 9.01 of this article; and
* it is likely that the patient will benefit from assisted outpatient treatment; and
* if the patient has executed a health care proxy as defined in article 29-C of the public health law, that any directions included in such proxy shall be taken into account by the court in determining the written treatment plan.

==Opposition==

Kendra's Law is opposed for different reasons by many groups, most notably the [[Anti-Psychiatry]] movement and the [[New York Civil Liberties Union]]. Opponents say that the law has harmed the mental health system, because it can scare patients away from seeking treatment.&lt;ref name=nyclu&gt;[http://www.nyclu.org/content/testimony-extending-kendras-law http://www.nyclu.org/content/testimony-extending-kendras-law Testimony: Extending Kendra's Law.]  Statement Of Beth Haroules Before The Assembly Standing Committee On Mental Health, Mental Retardation And Developmental Disabilities And The Assembly Standing Committee On Codes regarding New York State's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the law is also criticized as being [[race (classification of human beings)|racially]] and [[socioeconomic]]ally biased.&lt;ref name=nyclu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Lawyers for the Public Interest]], Inc., "Implementation of Kendra's Law is Severely Biased" (April 7, 2005) [http://www.nylpi.org/images/FE/chain234siteType8/site203/client/DLC%20-%20Press%20Release%20-%2004.07.05_Report_on_Kendras_Law.pdf] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Burns, the psychiatrist who originally advised the United Kingdom's government on United Kingdom's Laws that are similar to Kendra's Law, has also come to the conclusion they are ineffective and unnecessary. Professor Burns, once a strong supporter of the new powers, said he has been forced to change his mind after a study he conducted proved the orders "don't work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Manning|first=Sanchez|title='Psychiatric Asbos' were an error says key advisor|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/psychiatric-asbos-were-an-error-says-key-advisor-8572138.html|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=14 April 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John M. Grohol, PsyD, in his article "The Double Standard of Forced Treatment", says "Forced treatment for people with mental illness has had a long and abusive history, both here in the United States and throughout the world. No other medical specialty has the rights psychiatry and psychology do to take away a person's freedom in order to help "treat" that person. Historically, the profession has suffered from abusing this right — so much so that reform laws in the 1970s and 1980s took the profession's right away from them to confine people against their will. Such forced treatment now requires a judge's signature. But over time, that judicial oversight — which is supposed to be the check in our checks-and-balance system — has largely become a rubber stamp to whatever the doctor thinks is best. The patient's voice once again threatens to become silenced, now under the guise of "assisted outpatient treatment" (just a modern, different term for forced treatment)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grohol|first=John|title=The Double Standard of Forced Treatment|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2012/11/26/the-double-standard-of-forced-treatment/|publisher=PsychCentral|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Mexico Court of Appeals declared an Albuquerque
ordinance, modeled after Kendra's Law, requiring treatment for some mentally ill people conflicts
with state law and can't be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court Nixes Albuquerque Ordinance On Mentally Ill|url=http://www.nyaprs.org/e-news-bulletins/index.cfm?do=headlines&amp;mn=8&amp;yr=2008&amp;article=BD3895DE9E1E2C82CBA4DEC72C370093|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=Associated Press|date=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
A 2017 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] systematic review of the literature, that included three relatively small [[randomized controlled trial]]s, did not find significant differences in the use of services, social functioning, or quality of life when comparing compulsory community treatment with standard voluntary care or brief supervised discharge.&lt;ref name=Kisely2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kisely|first=Steve R.|last2=Campbell|first2=Leslie A.|last3=O'Reilly|first3=Richard|date=2017|title=Compulsory community and involuntary outpatient treatment for people with severe mental disorders|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=3|pages=CD004408|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004408.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28303578|via=|pmc=4393705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The systematic review did report that people who receive compulsory community treatment may be less likely to be victims of crime, both violent and non-violent.&lt;ref name=Kisely2017 /&gt;

A randomized, controlled trial published in The Lancet concluded, "the imposition of compulsory supervision does not reduce the rate of readmission of psychotic patients. We found no support in terms of any reduction in overall hospital admission to justify the significant curtailment of patients' personal liberty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burns|first=Thomas|author2=Jorun Rugkåsa |author3=Andrew Molodynski |author4=John Dawson |author5=Ksenija Yeeles |author6=Maria Vazquez-Montes |author7=Merryn Voysey |author8=Julia Sinclair |author9=Stefan Priebe  |journal=The Lancet|date=11 May 2013|volume=381|issue=9878|pages=1627–1633|pmid= 23537605| doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60107-5 |title=Community treatment orders for patients with psychosis (OCTET): a randomised controlled trial.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Of 442 patients assessed, 336 patients were randomly assigned to be discharged from hospital either on CTO (167 patients) or Section 17 leave (169 patients). One patient withdrew directly after randomisation and two were ineligible, giving a total sample of 333 patients (166 in the CTO group and 167 in the Section 17 group). At 12 months, despite the fact that the length of initial compulsory outpatient treatment differed significantly between the two groups (median 183 days CTO group vs 8 days Section 17 group, p&lt;0·001) the number of patients readmitted did not differ between groups (59 [36%] of 166 patients in the CTO group vs 60 [36%] of 167 patients in the Section 17 group; adjusted relative risk 1·0 [95% CI 0·75—1·33]).}}

A 2005 study, Kendra's Law: A Final Report on the Status of Assisted Outpatient Treatment, done by New York State's Office of Mental Health, concluded, "Over a three year period prior to their AOT order, almost all (97%) had been hospitalized (with an average of three hospitalizations per recipient), and many experienced homelessness, arrest, and incarceration. During participation in the AOT program, rates for hospitalizations, homelessness, arrests, and incarcerations have declined significantly, and program participants have experienced a lessening of the stress associated with these events."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.omh.ny.gov/omhweb/kendra_web/finalreport/ |title=Kendra's Law Final Report on the Status of Assisted Outpatient Treatment |periodical=Office of Mental Health NY |last=Carpinello |first=Sharon  |publication-date=March 2005 |work= |accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study, New York State Assisted Outpatient Treatment Evaluation done by [[Duke University]], Policy Research Associates, [[University of Virginia]], concluded that New York State's program

{{quote|improves a range of important outcomes for its recipients, apparently without feared negative consequences to recipients. The increased services available under AOT clearly improve recipient outcomes, however, the AOT court order, itself, and its monitoring do appear to offer additional benefits in improving outcomes. It is also important to recognize that the AOT order exerts a critical effect on service providers stimulating their efforts to prioritize care for AOT recipients.}}

The authors said that the evaluation reflected not just the compulsory aspects of the program, but the additional resources provided for recipients, particularly in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.macarthur.virginia.edu/aot_finalreport.pdf |title=New York State Assisted Outpatient Treatment Program Evaluation |periodical=Office of Mental Health NY |last=Swartz |first=Marvin  |publication-date=2009-06-30 |work= |accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
On January 15, 2013, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] signed into law a new measure that extended Kendra's Law through 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/15/us/new-york-gun-bill/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 | work=CNN | title=N.Y. governor signs nation's first gun-control bill since Newtown - CNN.com | date=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonidas D. Marinelli''' (28 November 1906 &amp;ndash; 13 September 1974), was born in [[Argentina]] and died in [[Hinsdale, Illinois|Hinsdale]], [[DuPage County]], [[Illinois]] was an American [[radiologist]], [[health physicist]] and [[inventor]].&lt;ref&gt;Fano, U. (1975) Leonidas D. Marinelli (1906–1974). ''Radiation Research'': March 1975, Vol. 61, No. 3, pp. 538-539.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Brucer|Brucer, Marshall]]. (May 1975) [http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/115.2.488?journalCode=radiology Leonidas D. Marinelli, Ph.D.] ''Radiology'', Vol. 115, No. 2:488 –489&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and Education==
Marinelli was born of Italian parents in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on November 28, 1906, eldest son of 6 children of bank owner Vincenzo Marinelli and Amelia Sammartino Marinelli. At age 11, he returned with widowed mother and children to Agnone, Italy, seat of the Marinelli family bell makers.  Leonidas graduated the Volta Institute of Naples, October, 1925, with the gold medal prize for highest honors. In January, 1926, he emigrated to New York City and supported himself as a meter tester while working his way through Cooper Union Night School of Electrical Engineering. In 1929 Dr. Gioacchino Failla, former student of Mme. Marie Curie, hired Marinelli to the biolphysical laboratory at Memorial Cancer Hospital, New York City, known today as [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]]).  Hardly a year later, Leonidas adapted the x-ray roentgen unit for the measurement of low-level gamma ray radiation, not previously quantifiable, which made X-ray and radium radiation comparable by the same unit.  By 1933 he coauthored his first publication with [[Gioacchino Failla|Failla]], [[Edith Quimby]], and [[John E. Rose]]. In 1938 he completed all course requirements for the PhD at Columbia University and had published 5 papers in radiological journals.

==Dr. John E. Rose - Health Physicist==
Dr. [[John E. Rose]] would become [[Health Physics]] and radiological physics division director at Argonne. Rose was involved with radiation detection instrumentation, including hand and foot monitors and other detectors. Further note regarding Rose: it was in the [[Manhattan District]] of [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] that the name "health physics" was born, and great advances were made in [[radiation safety]]. From the beginning, the leaders of the Manhattan District recognized that a new and intense source of [[radiation]] and [[radioactivity]] would be created, and thus, in the summer of 1942, asked [[Ernest O. Wollan]], a cosmic ray [[physicist]] at the [[University of Chicago]], to form a group to study and control radiation hazards. Thus, Wollan was the first to bear the title of [[health physicist]]. He was soon joined by [[Carl G. Gamertsfelder]], recently graduated physics baccalaureate, and [[Herbert Parker (scientist)|Herbert M. Parker]], the noted British-American [[medical physicist]]. By mid 1943, six others had been added: [[Karl Z. Morgan]], [[James C. Hart]], [[Robert R. Coveyou]], Ole G. Landsverk, Ph.D. of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory, University of Chicago, [[L.A. Pardue]] and Dr. John E. Rose.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1980"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kathren, R. and Ziemer, P.|first1=Editors|title=Health Physics: A Backward Glance|date=1980|publisher=Pergamon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Manhattan District, the name ''[[health physicist]]'' seems to have been derived in part from the need for secrecy (and hence a code name for [[radiation protection]] activities) and the fact that there was a group of mostly physicists working on health related problems. Thus, their activities included development of appropriate monitoring instruments, developing physical controls, administrative procedures, monitoring areas and personnel, and [[radioactive waste]] disposal—in short, the entire spectrum of modern-day radiation protection problems. It was in the Manhattan District that many of the modern concepts of protection were born, including the [[rem (unit)|rem]] unit, which took into account the biological effectiveness of the radiation, and the maximum permissible concentration (MPC) for inhaled radioactivity. Indeed, it was in the Manhattan District that modern day radiation protection effects, born in the early days of x-ray and radium, realized their maturity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1980"/&gt;

==Career and Profession==
In 1935 Marinelli became an Assistant [[Physicist]].

In the 1940s Marinelli became an independent [[scientist]]. In 1941 his papers dealt with post-irradiation blood studies and with early [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]] work on [[cancer]]; in 1942 with the production of chromosomal breaks in plant cells and with the theory of time distribution of [[Radiation therapy|radiation treatments]]. In February, 1942, he published the theoretical basis for internal radiation dosimetry that provided the basis for nuclear medicine.  In 1946, he published its systematic application to the radioactive treatment of functional cancer of the thyroid. This breakthrough was followed by [[autoradiography]] techniques and by a ''Review of Modern Physics'' report on [[beta rays]]. The explosive growth of [[radiation medicine]] enlarged his responsibilities as Head of Physics at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Institute. In 1948 he added to his publication of internal radiation dosimetry the supplementary biological considerations contributed by Edith Quimby.  Economic ease permitted him now to enjoy fully his role of husband and father of a wonderful family.

In 1948 he moved to the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], with a position on the [[University of Chicago]] faculty. Here, with John Rose, he provided early leadership and scientific direction of the Radiological Physics Division.

Maturity was marked by authorship of textbook articles on dosimetry in the ''Annual Review of Nuclear Science'', in ''Radiation Biology'', and in the ''Handbook of Medical Radiology''. His studies of [[physics]] dealt now with electron diffusion from point sources in air
and with the [[cosmic ray]] background. 
In [[radiology]] he pioneered the detection of minimal burdens of [[radioactivity]] in humans, studying their distribution and
variation in tissues and the epidemiology of chronic low levels of radiation.
The Center for Human Radiobiology, which now has the responsibility for all [[Atomic Energy Commission (disambiguation)|AEC]]-supported research on the effects of internally deposited radioisotopes, grew out of his effort.

Nature granted Marinelli a generous amount of vitality and healthy spirits, but then allowed an early onset of health problems that sadly shortened his life and his warm contact that had been enjoyed by all who were blessed to know him.

===Marinelli beaker===
The following footnote regarding the Marinelli beaker is found in a report by R.F. Hill, G.J. Hine and L.D. Marinelli (1950) of the Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York:&lt;br&gt;
"This equipment first designed by one of the present authors (L.D.M.) and in use in this laboratory since 1943, can now be obtained from Technical Associates, Inc. Glendale, California."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill, R.F., Hine, G.J. and Marinelli, L.D.|title=The Quantitative Determination of Gamma Radiation in Biological Research|journal=American Journal of Roentgenology and Radium Therapy|date=February 1950|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marinelli glass beaker.png|thumbnail|left|Marinelli glass beaker]]

====Development====
In the 1940s and 1950s, the main application of the Marinelli beaker was the analysis of I-131 in liquids (e.g., urine). The original version of the Marinelli beaker, pictured here, consisted of a pyrex/glass laboratory beaker with a central hollow tube projecting from the bottom. A detector, usually a glass GM tube designed for gamma counting, was positioned in the central tube while the beaker was filled with the sample. Since the sample effectively surrounded the detector, the counting efficiency was greater than would be the case if the sample were in any other type of container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bruner, H.D.  |author2=Perkinson, J.D.|title=A Comparison of Iodine-131 Counting Methods|journal=Nucleonics|date=October 1952|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A laboratory often used Marinelli beakers of different sizes - small beakers for small volume samples and large beakers for large volume samples. While it was always possible to increase the volume of a small sample by dilution so that it would fill a large beaker, this sacrificed counting efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Marinelli, L.D.  |author2=Hill, R.F.|title=Brookhaven National Laboratory Conference Report BNL-C-5|date=1948|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-to-late1950's when [[liquid scintillation counting]]s came along and [[Scintillation counter#Gamma|gamma scintillator]]s ([[Sodium iodide#Radiation physics and medicine|NaI crystals]]) became larger and more widely available, the major options for counting liquid samples were Marinelli beakers, jacketed ([[Annulus (mathematics)|annular]]) [[Geiger–Müller tube|GM tubes]], and dipping GM tubes . Since Marinelli beakers could hold larger volume samples than annular GMs, they had a higher counting efficiency for [[gamma rays]]. On the other hand, their efficiency for [[beta particles]] was lower than that of annular GM tubes because the betas had to penetrate the glass of the beaker as well as the GM tube wall.  Dipping GM tubes, which were dipped into the radioactive solution, were primarily used for beta emitters. While the problem was not as severe as with the annular GM, they could be difficult to clean - a potential problem with long-lived radionuclides.
[[File:Marinelli glass tube for GM.png|thumbnail|right|Marinelli glass tube for GM]]
A different type of alternative was to dry the sample and count it with an end window GM or [[electroscope]] (e.g., the Landsverk Model L-75). However, the preparation of dried samples was difficult to perform in a reproducible manner and it risked the volatilization of the iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Landsverk, O. G., Wollan, E.

As [[Sodium iodide#Radiation physics and medicine|NaI detectors]] became more widely available, workers started to use the type of sample container that most people think of today as the Marinelli beaker: a relatively large plastic jar/beaker with an annular bottom that slid over the NaI crystal (e.g., Haigh, 1954 and Dratz, 1957). Sometimes referred to as a "well-bottom" container, the end of the well was sealed so that the container "hung" from the top of the detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dratz|first1=A.F.|title=Well-Bottom Container Improves Gamma Counting|journal=Nucleonics|date=August 1957|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linda Austin''' (born 1951) is an American psychiatrist. She is known for her work with mental health awareness via the media.&lt;ref name=NLM&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Linda S. Austin|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_15.html|publisher=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
In 1976, Austin earned her MD from [[Duke University]]. Afterwards, she was a [[child psychiatry]] fellow at [[Georgetown University]]. There, she was also a clinical instructor for [[psychiatry]]. In 1986, she became a staff member at the [[Medical University of South Carolina]]. Three years later, she was named the assistant professor of psychiatry and director of the [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] program. In 1995, Austin received [[tenure]] and one year later became the associate dean for public education. She became a full-time psychiatry professor in 1999. Additionally, she is an [[American Psychological Association]] fellow.

After [[Hurricane Hugo]], Austin used media sources such as television and radio for the purpose of public mental health education and changing the stigma that goes along with mental illness. She was featured in the American Psychological Association's film ''[[Depression: The Storm Within]]'' and in the same year she started her own mental health talk-show on [[NPR]] called "[[What's on Your Mind?]]".&lt;ref name=NLM /&gt; She is also responsible for the updated webpage of the [[Medical University of South Carolina]] which includes over 900 award-winning podcasts.&lt;ref name=Duke&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Alumni Council|url=http://medalumni.duke.edu/about-dmaa/medical-alumni-council/austin|publisher=Duke Medical Alumni Association|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from writing two books, one of which was featured on the [[Oprah Winfrey]] show, and hosting her own talk show, Austin practices psychiatry around 20 hours a week.&lt;ref name=NLM /&gt;&lt;ref name=MUSC&gt;{{cite web|title=Podcast Library |url=http://www.muschealth.com/podcast/austin.htm |publisher=Medical University of South Carolina |accessdate=5 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407083402/http://www.muschealth.com/podcast/austin.htm |archivedate= 7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[human reproduction]], a '''live birth''' occurs when a [[fetus]], whatever its [[gestational age]], exits the [[maternal]] body and subsequently shows any sign of life, such as [[voluntary muscle|voluntary movement]], [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]], or pulsation of the [[umbilical cord]], for however brief a time and regardless of whether the umbilical cord or [[placenta]] are intact.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems. Tenth Revision. Vol 2. Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization, 1993:129.&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition of the term "live birth" was created by the [[World Health Organization]] in 1950 and is chiefly used for public health and [[statistics|statistical]] purposes. Whether the [[childbirth|birth]] is [[vagina]]l or by [[Caesarean section]], and whether the [[neonate]] is ultimately viable, is not relevant to this statistical definition.  However, the term "live birth" was in common use long before 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?num=100&amp;q=%22live+birth%22+date%3A1500-1950&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=1 Search full view Google Books for "live birth" prior to the year 1950].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the term "born alive" is defined by federal statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/01/8-|title=1 U.S. Code § 8 - "Person", "human being", "child", and "individual" as including born-alive infant|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, live births are recorded on a U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth, also known as a [[birth certificate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/revisions-of-the-us-standard-certificates-and-reports.htm|title=NVSS - Revisions of the U.S. Standard Certificates and Reports|date=2017-08-30|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States recorded 3.95 million live births in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Martin JA, Hamilton BE, Osterman MJK, Driscoll AK, Drake P.

During the [[luteal phase]] (latter half) of the [[menstrual cycle]], due to increased mammary [[blood flow]] and/or [[premenstrual fluid retention]] caused by high circulating concentrations of [[estrogen]] and/or [[progesterone]], the breasts temporarily increase in size, and this is experienced by women as fullness, heaviness, swollenness, and a tingling sensation.&lt;ref name="LawrenceLawrence2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ruth A.

Lymphoid and plasma cells infiltrate the stroma. Clinically, mammary blood flow increases in this luteal phase. This increased flow is experienced by women as fullness, heaviness, and turgescence.

The '''mandibular first molar''' or '''six-year molar''' is the [[tooth]] located distally (away from the midline of the [[face]]) from both the [[mandibular second premolar]]s of the [[mouth]] but mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both [[mandibular second molar]]s. It is located on the mandibular (lower) arch of the mouth, and generally opposes the maxillary (upper) first molars and the maxillary 2nd premolar in normal class I occlusion.  The function of this [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] is similar to that of all molars in regard to grinding being the principal action during [[mastication]], commonly known as chewing. There are usually five well-developed [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]s on mandibular first molars: two on the buccal (side nearest the cheek), two lingual (side nearest the [[tongue]]), and one distal. The shape of the developmental and supplementary grooves, on the occlusal surface, are describes as being 'M' shaped. There are great differences between the [[deciduous teeth|deciduous]] (baby) mandibular molars and those of the permanent mandibular molars, even though their function are similar. The permanent mandibular molars are not considered to have any teeth that precede it. Despite being named molars, the deciduous molars are followed by permanent premolars.

In the [[Universal numbering system (dental)|universal system of notation]], the deciduous mandibular first molars are designated by a letter written in uppercase. The right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as "S", and the left one is known as "L". The international notation has a different system of notation. Thus, the right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as "84", and the left one is known as "74".

In the universal system of notation, the permanent mandibular first molars are designated by a number. The right permanent mandibular first molar is known as "30", and the left one is known as "19". The [[Palmer notation]] uses a number in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found. For this tooth, the left and right first molars would have the same number, "6", but the right one would have the symbol, "┐", over it, while the left one would have, "┌". The international notation has a different numbering system than the previous two, and the right permanent mandibular first molar is known as "46", and the left one is known as "36".
Mandibular permanent first molars usually have four pulp horns.

The first molar is usually the first permanent tooth to erupt and has adult undertones.

== Anatomy ==
The mandibular first molar has five cusps:  the mesiobuccal (MB, toward midline and cheek), mesiolingual (ML, toward midline and tongue), distolingual (DL, away from midline and towards tongue), distobuccal (DB, away from midline and toward cheek), and distal (D, away from midline), listed in order of decreasing size.  Listed in order of decreasing height they are: ML, DL, DF, MF, and D.  An eighth cusp was found in a primary second lower molar in an Argentinean child. Viewed from the top of the tooth (occlusal view), the mandibular first molar is pentagonal (five sided) in shape and tapers toward the lingual, with the sides being the buccal surface, the mesial surface, the lingual surface, distal surface, and the distobuccal surface.  The occlusal surface has four grooves.  The central groove is not straight but runs down the center of the tooth mesially to distally and contains four pits (mesial, central, central, and distal).  The distobuccal groove runs from the distal pit in the central groove distobuccally separating the distal and distobuccal cusps.  The lingual groove runs from the more distal of the central pits in the central groove toward the lingual surface between the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps.  The buccal groove runs from the more mesial of the central pits in the central groove toward the buccal surface between the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps ending in the buccal pit.  The portion of the central groove between the central pits is termed the [[Lewis offset]] and is mandatory to account for the locations of the buccal and lingual grooves (buccal groove being more mesial than the lingual groove while they are parallel).  From the buccal (buccal view), two roots are present.  The distal root is generally straighter, although both often have a slight distal curvature.  The heights of contour on the mesial and distal contact the adjacent teeth and are located at the junction of the occlusal and middle thirds of the crown.  The mesial view shows a slight tipping of the crown to the lingual.  Both roots have flutings but they are more prominent on the mesial root.  The mesial root is broader buccolingually and its apex is more blunted. The height of contour on the buccal is in the gingival third and the occlusal two thirds of the surface is flat.  The lingual height of contour is in the middle third of the tooth and the lingual surface is evenly convex.  The sharpness of the mesiolingual cusp can also be noted from this view.

==Pathology==
The shape of the developmental and supplementary grooves, on the occlusal surface, is describes as being 'M' shaped. The mandibular first molars are the most common [[dental caries|carious]] teeth and the most common teeth to undergo [[endodontic treatment]] or [[tooth extraction|extraction]]. Up to 45% of all extracted teeth are mandibular first molars.&lt;ref name="ZadikOOOOE"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zadik Y, Sandler V, Bechor R, Salehrabi R |title=Analysis of factors related to extraction of endodontically treated teeth |journal=Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod |volume= 106|issue= 5|pages= e31|date=August 2008 |pmid=18718782 |doi=10.1016/j.tripleo.2008.06.017 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;...it is erupted at 6–7 years

The '''Marcus Foundation''' refers to three different foundations. The Marcus Niziak Childhood Brain Tumor Fund (see below); The Grace R. and Alan D. Marcus Foundation and The Marcus Foundation. The latter Foundation funds and partners with organizations that are making a difference in the delivery of community food resources or are expanding the understanding and implementation of sustainability.

The Marcus Niziak Childhood Brain Tumor Fund, is a public foundation established in memory of Mark S. Niziak, Jr. ("Marcus") who died of a brain tumor shortly after his fifth birthday. The purpose of The Foundation is to promote and fund clinical research relating to the treatment of childhood [[brain tumors]].

== Mark S. Niziak, Jr. ("Marcus") ==
Mark S. Niziak, Jr. ("Marcus") was born on August 29, 1985. Two years later, he was diagnosed with an [[ependymoma]], a [[tumor]] that arises from the [[ependyma]]. Following his diagnosis, Marcus had his first surgery in June 1987. After which, he started his first round of [[chemotherapy]]. From September to December, he underwent a round of radiation. Finally, in the year 1988 it seemed as though the tumor had gone away.

However, by the end of 1988, the cancer returned. At the age of three, Marcus was admitted to the Children's Hospital in Boston for his second surgery. The surgery lasted sixteen hours and was followed by more chemotherapy and a linear accelerator treatment at Brigham and the Women's Hospital in Boston.  

In June 1990, Marcus was transferred to New York's [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] to undergo an autologous bone marrow transplant, but the treatment was unsuccessful and Marcus died on September 20, 1990.

== Fundraising ==
The Marcus Foundation is able to fund clinical research and build medical rooms because of the contributions of individuals, corporations, families, and public and corporate foundations. The Foundation accepts both monetary and value-in-kind donations, and organizes various fundraisers throughout the year. 

The most important fundraising event that The Foundation holds is the Annual Golf Tournament. It typically begins with a quick lunch, followed by a tee-off. Throughout the duration of the Tournament, refreshments are brought out to the players. Players are separated into four-person teams to play a scramble game of golf. In the evening, the event is concluded with a banquet, raffle and silent auction.

== Supporters ==
The creation and continuance of The Marcus Foundation has been made possible by the support of the people involved, including Dr. Cynthia  S. Kretschmar, Dr. Elizabeth Dooling, Frank Bailey, Joyce Leach, Bradley Niziak, Larry and Claire Wilson. Organizations such as The Red Sox and Sunlife Financial have also been instrumental in supporting The Foundation.

'''Myanmar Red Cross Society''' (MRCS) was founded in 1937 and it was earlier called Burma Red Cross. It has its headquarters in [[Yangon]].

==History==
In 1920, the Society came into existence as a branch of [[Indian Red Cross Society]]. When Burma was politically separated from India in 1937, it attained national status and was recognised as Burma Red Cross Society. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) recognised it as a National Society in 1939. The Society was admitted to the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] in 1946. The Burma Red Cross Act was enacted in 1959 and amended subsequently in 1964, 1971 and 1988.

The 1959 (MRCS) Act confers responsibility to the National Society in implementing [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] activities and alleviating human suffering. The [[St. John Ambulance Brigade]] Overseas was taken over by the Society as Burma Ambulance Brigade under the 1959 Act. The Society was renamed Myanmar Red Cross Society in accordance with legislative change of the name from [[Burma]] to [[Myanmar]] in 1989.

The objective of the Society is to alleviate human suffering. Three activities such as promoting health, preventing diseases and providing help to those in distress are supportive activities to meet the objective.

As the leading humanitarian organisation, Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) is committed to assist vulnerable people and to improve and maintain their health and well-being.
The Society obtains the best relations with [[UN agencies|UN Agencies]], Non Government Organisations, Press and other public information media. News coverage of Red Cross Activities in the whole country is constantly made by the press, radio and television news stations.

==Vision and mission==

The vision is "to be a well-functioning National Society with the capacity of providing humanitarian services to the most vulnerable people in Myanmar and beyond."

MRCS' mission is "to develop safe and resilient communities through integrated community based initiatives, promoting humanitarian values by resourceful branches and the network of volunteers and members and to play an auxiliary role to the State in humanitarian field through strong legal base."

==Strategic plans (2016-2020)==
Future plans and actions are clearly defined in the MRCS strategic plan (2016–2020). Activities are defined under five programme areas: Organisational Development, Health and Care in the Community, [[Disaster management|Disaster Management]], Cooperation and Coordination and Financial Resources Development, with these, the Society is putting her ablest effort to deliver efficient effective humanitarian services in Myanmar.

==Governance and management==
The General Assembly is the highest governing body of the Society and is convened every three years. The Central Council is the governing body of the MRCS between the sessions of the General Assembly. The Central Council comprises 40 members, out of which 17 members represent States and Divisions level branches. The governance of the Society is formed by 10 Executive Committee members. 5 out of 10 members are retired professionals and who work full-time on voluntary basis, are responsible for providing guidance for making policy, giving directions and guidance in the implementation of the activities of the Society.
The structure of National Headquarters (NHQ) consists of six Divisions and two Units. They are Administrative Division, Disaster Management Division, Finance Division, Health Division, Training Division and Communication Division, Development and Coordination Unit and Protocol Unit.

The management is headed by the Executive Director, who is the full-time Executive Committee member of the National Society. The Executive Director carries out his functions under the authority of the Central Council and the Executive Committee.
The Society is the largest humanitarian organization in Myanmar with its nationwide network of 330 branches (townships) with over 250000 volunteers throughout the country.

==Awards==
A member of Myanmar Red Cross Society won [[Henry Dunant Medal]] in 1977 for saving a soldier whose car fell into the [[Ayeyarwady River]] which was icy cold at that time . His name was Sai Aung Hlaing Myint. He was from [[Kachin State]].

The '''NASA Space Radiation Laboratory''' ('''NSRL''', previously called Booster Applications Facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://server.c-ad.bnl.gov/esfd/nsrl/operations/index.html | title = NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory | accessdate = 2012-07-25 | work = Brookhaven National Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt;), is a United States [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|national laboratory]] and part of the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], located in [[Upton, New York]] on [[Long Island]]. It is dedicated to learn about the possible risks to human beings [[Health threat from cosmic rays|exposed to cosmic radiation]].

==Overview==
Although Brookhaven Lab researchers and their colleagues used beams of heavy ions for radiobiology research at another Brookhaven accelerator from 1995, the NSRL became operational during summer 2003, and over 75 experimenters from some 20 institutions from the U.S. and abroad have taken part on radiobiology research.&lt;ref name='intro'/&gt; Jointly managed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and NASA’s Johnson Space Center, the facility employs beams of heavy ions extracted from Brookhaven’s Booster accelerator that are then used to simulate the [[Cosmic ray]]s found in space. NSRL also features its own beam line dedicated to radiobiology research, as well as specimen-preparation areas.

==Science==
Since [[astronaut]]s are spending more time in outer space, they are receiving more exposure to ionizing radiation, a stream of particles that, when passing through a body, has enough energy to cause the atoms and molecules within that substance to become an [[ion]]. By directly or indirectly ionizing and thus damaging the components of living cells, including genetic material called [[DNA]], ionizing radiation may cause changes in cells' ability to carry out repair and reproduction. This may lead to mutations, which, in turn, may result in [[tumor]]s, [[cancer]], genetic defects in offspring, or death.

Although the spacecraft itself somewhat reduces radiation exposure, it does not completely shield astronauts from galactic cosmic rays, which are highly energetic heavy ions, or from [[solar energetic particles]], which primarily are energetic protons. By one NASA estimate, for each year that astronauts spend in deep space, about one-third of their DNA will be hit directly by heavy ions.&lt;ref name='intro'/&gt;

NSRL researchers employ the unique [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] to irradiate a variety of biological specimens, tissues, and cells, as well as DNA in solution. Other experimenters use industrial materials as samples, studying their suitability for [[space suit]]s and spacecraft shielding.&lt;ref name='research'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://spaceradiation.usra.edu/ | title = NASA Space Radiation  Research | accessdate = 2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In increasing knowledge of the effects of cosmic radiation, NSRL studies may expand the understanding of the link between ionizing radiation and aging or neuro-degeneration, as well as cancer. In aiming to limit the damage to healthy tissue by ionization, NSRL research may also lead to improvements in cancer radiation treatments.&lt;ref name='intro'/&gt;

The '''National Poisons Information Service''' is an information service commissioned by [[Public Health England]] on behalf of the UK health departments. Poisoning accounts for 1% of NHS admissions. [[Pesticide]]s used in agriculture ([[glyphosate]] and [[organophosphorus]] insecticides) are extremely toxic, but 87% of around 120,000 annual poisoning cases in the UK take place in the home.

==History==
In August 1962 the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]] announced it was forming a poisons information service. This was after the ''Emergency Treatment in Hospital of Cases of Acute Poisoning'' published by the [[Central Health Services Council]] in March 1962. Many more household chemicals were on the market, and the chemical composition was only known to the manufacturers. 4,000 to 5,000 people each year were lethally poisoned, with 6,085 in 1962; however, many of the deaths were (non-accidental) suicides. 

It started in 1963 by Dr [[Roy Goulding]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/5751 Roy Goulding]&lt;/ref&gt; at the Medical Toxicology Unit of [[Guy's Hospital]], with a staff of 65. By the late 1960s, [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] were presenting a widespread danger. Other centres were soon set up in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff.

UKTIS was based in Newcastle from 1995.

==Structure==
It has four units in Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Newcastle. It is a member of the [[European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists]].

* NPIS Birmingham Unit (West Midlands Poisons Unit), [[City Hospital, Birmingham]] - Professor [[Allister Vale]]
* NPIS Cardiff Unit, [[Cardiff and Vale University Health Board|Llandough Hospital]] - Dr John Thompson
* NPIS Edinburgh Unit (Scottish Poisons Information Bureau),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spib.scot.nhs.uk Scottish Poisons Information Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] - Dr. Euan Sandilands.
* NPIS Newcastle Unit, Regional Drug and Therapeutics Centre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyrdtc.nhs.uk Regional Drug and Therapeutics Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newcastle University]] - Professor Simon Thomas

NPIS Birmingham has the NPIS Product Data Centre, provided by manufacturer's information, and deals with around 2,300 companies.

NPIS supports (24 hours) NHS Direct (for England and Wales) and (24 hours) [[NHS 24]] for Scotland. Northern Ireland has its Northern Ireland Regional Medicines and Poisons Information Service in Belfast, and NPIS is used when this is not available. The Republic of Ireland uses the service, via the TOXBASE database, which is used by the country's National Poisons Information Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poisons.ie Poisons Information Centre - Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all UK nations, Wales has the highest proportionate number of enquiries to the service, with Northern Ireland the fewest. Within England, there is a distribution of higher number of enquiries to the service in the north than the south, with [[NHS North East]] having the highest and [[NHS South of England]] having the least proportionate number of enquiries. The vast majority (95%) of enquiries come from A&amp;E departments. Around 65% of poisoning is from pharmaceuticals ([[paracetamol]], [[ibuprofen]], [[citalopram]], [[diazepam]] and [[zopiclone]]) and 15% from household chemicals ([[detergent]]s, [[bleach]], and [[Isopropyl alcohol|isopropanol]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npis.org/NPISAnnualReport2010-11.pdf Annual report]&lt;/ref&gt; There are very dangerous chemicals stored in most UK kitchens.

Wednesday is the busiest day of the week for enquiries, with the fewest at the weekend.

==Function==
The NPIS operates a 24-hour telephone advice service and internet database TOXBASE ([http://www.toxbase.org www.toxbase.org] for registered healthcare departments only). TOXBASE is free for UK NHS departments, and available by subscription to departments outwith the UK NHS. The TOXBASE app is also available for Apple and Android devices. The app is free for individual NHS users. 

The TOXBASE database contains information on approximately 17,000 products, together with generic advice on the management of poisoning. In excess of 1.5 million product accesses are made to the database each year. Most of the accesses are made by A&amp;E staff. 

NHS 111, NHS 24 and NHS Direct all use the TOXBASE database. In the UK poisons information can also be found in the [[British National Formulary]].

[[File:NBPtoday.jpg|thumb|The [[New Bilibid Prison]] complex]] 
The '''New Bilibid Prison drug trafficking scandal''' is a criminal investigation and political scandal concerning allegations of government involvement in [[Illegal drug trade in the Philippines|illegal drug trade]] at the [[New Bilibid Prison]] in [[Muntinlupa]], [[Metro Manila]], Philippines. The allegations were made by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] after announcing that the two top convicted drug lords in the country continued to run their [[drug ring]]s from inside the national penitentiary with former administration officials and their local government cohorts as co-conspirators.&lt;ref name="philstar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/07/1600641/duterte-threatens-top-drug-lords-you-will-die |title=Duterte threatens top 'drug lords': You will die |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author=Romero, A. |date=7 July 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/07/08/Duterte-names-topmost-drug-lords.html |title=Duterte names country's topmost drug lords |publisher=[[CNN Philippines]] |author=Andolong, I. |date=8 July 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 25, 2016, Duterte released a drug matrix showing the structure of drug trafficking operations at the New Bilibid Prison and identified the two former top officials of the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]], the former provincial governor and board member of [[Pangasinan]], and the former [[Bureau of Corrections (Philippines)|Bureau of Corrections]] director as being involved in the Bilibid narcotics trade.&lt;ref name="gma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/578865/news/nation/duterte-releases-illegal-drug-trade-matrix-at-the-new-bilibid-prison |title=Duterte releases illegal drug trade matrix at the New Bilibid Prison |publisher=[[GMA News]] |date=25 August 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/809467/duterte-matrix-out-de-lima-ex-pangasinan-gov-in-bilibid-drug-trade |title=Duterte matrix out; tags De Lima, ex-Pangasinan gov, others |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Esguerra, A.Q. |date=25 August 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philstar2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/08/25/1617135/duterte-matrix-tags-de-lima-ex-pangasinan-guv-drug-trade |title=Duterte matrix tags De Lima, ex-Pangasinan guv in drug trade |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author=Viray, P.L. |date=25 August 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Reports of illegal drug trafficking and use among inmates of the New Bilibid Prison have surfaced increasingly since 2014 when officials under the administration of President [[Benigno Aquino III]] launched a series of raids under ''Oplan Galugad'' ("Operation Surprise Inspection") at the national penitentiary. In a much publicized [[2014 New Bilibid Prison raids|December 2014 raid]], the police discovered [[methamphetamine]] ({{lang-fil|shabu}}) and other drug paraphernalia, inflatable sex dolls, a stripper bar and jacuzzi spread across 19 air-conditioned [[villa]]s ({{lang-fil|kubol}}) built for convicted drug dealers.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2875741/Prison-sex-drugs-bribery-scandal-shocks-Philippines.html |title=Prison sex, drugs and bribery scandal shocks Philippines |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent raids, police also found other items and contrabands prohibited in the prison such as firearms and bladed weapons, mobile phones, flat screen TVs, laptops, WIFi, luxury [[Patek Philippe]], [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] and [[Rolex]] watches, sauna and over {{Philippine peso|2 million}} in cash from body searches of several high profile inmates.&lt;ref name="rappler3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/78395-new-bilibid-prison-vip |title=IN PHOTOS: Drug lords, murderers, and high living in Bilibid |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Cupin, B. |date=19 December 2014 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pdi2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/657356/drug-lords-rule-new-bilibid-prison |title=Drug lords rule New Bilibid Prison |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author1=Mangunay, K.F. |author2=Carvajal, N.C. |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the villa of convicted drug lord Peter Co linked by secret pathways to areas around the Bilibid, authorities also seized documents containing a list of names with corresponding cash amounts and dates.&lt;ref name="pdi2"/&gt; In another ''kubol'' occupied by convicted drug lord and robbery gang leader Herbert Colanggo, a 60-square-meter music studio was discovered where he reportedly was able to even produce a music video that went viral on ''[[YouTube]]''.&lt;ref name="pdi2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coco2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manila.coconuts.co/2014/12/17/bilibid-inmate-herbert-colanggo-shot-music-video-inside-prison |title=VIP inmate Herbert Colangco shot music video inside luxurious Bilibid 'prison cell' |publisher=[[Coconuts Media]] |date=17 December 2014 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Justice, which supervises the New Bilibid Prison through its [[Bureau of Corrections (Philippines)|Bureau of Corrections]], conducted more than 30 raids from 2014 to 2016 under then Justice Secretary [[Leila de Lima]].&lt;ref name="rappler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/140579-alvarez-probe-drug-use-prison-de-lima |title=Alvarez to probe drug use in Bilibid during De Lima's time |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Cepeda, M. |date=22 July 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the raids which resulted in the termination and replacement of prison personnel, the transfer of several convicted drug dealers to the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] detention facility, the demolition of luxurious prison villas, and regular searches and seizures, illegal drug trade continued at the maximum security prison as the Secretary admitted in 2015.&lt;ref name="rappler2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/80573-drug-trade-bilibid-raids |title=Bilibid drug trade continues despite raids |publisher=[[Rappler]] |date=12 January 2015 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of illegal drug operations at the Bilibid persisted throughout the remaining months of [[Presidency of Benigno Aquino III|Aquino's term]] and even became a contentious election topic in 2016. During the [[PiliPinas Debates 2016 – Visayas leg|2nd presidential debate]] held in [[Cebu City]] in March 2016, Duterte called administration candidate and former Interior Secretary [[Mar Roxas]] a "fraud" and blasted the administration for "allowing shabu to be cooked inside the national penitentiary."&lt;ref name="gmanews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/559834/news/nation/duterte-roxas-continue-feud-in-second-leg-of-pilipinas-debates-2016 |title=Duterte, Roxas continue feud in second leg of PiliPinas Debates 2016 |publisher=[[GMA News]] |author=Merueñas, M. |date=21 March 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Lima, then running for senator, slammed Duterte's allegation and said there was no truth in the claims that drug trade flourished in the Bilibid during the Aquino administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manila.coconuts.co/2016/03/23/de-lima-slams-duterte-allegation-drug-trade-flourished-bilibid |title=De Lima slams Duterte for allegation that drug trade flourished in Bilibid |publisher=[[Coconuts Media]] |date=23 March 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations==
[[File:Rodrigo Duterte showing diagram of drug trade network 1 7.7.16.jpg|thumb|President Rodrigo Duterte presents a chart illustrating a drug trade network of high level drug syndicates in the Philippines during a press conference]]
Following his landslide victory in the [[Philippine presidential election, 2016|May 2016 elections]], Duterte launched an [[Philippine Drug War|intensified anti-drug campaign]] and ordered the investigation of the personalities behind the proliferation of illegal drug trade at the Bilibid. The new Justice Secretary [[Vitaliano Aguirre II]] reported that 75% of drug transactions in the country were being "cooked" in Bilibid and announced that eliminating drug trade in prisons will be a priority of his department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/rich-media/137592-rodrigo-duterte-justice-vitaliano-aguirre-priorities |title=DOJ under Duterte admin: Reform BuCor, New Bilibid Prison |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Santos, R. |date=26 June 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2016, just one week since he took office, Duterte publicly named the top three drug lords behind the huge syndicates in the country and threatened to kill them if they continue their operations. He identified them as Wu Tuan alias "Peter Co", a Chinese triad member operating in Metro Manila and [[Luzon]], Herbert Colanggo (sometimes spelled Colangco) alias "Ampang", another Chinese who was reported to be connected to [[Kuratong Baleleng]] and the Parojinog drug syndicate in [[Mindanao]], and Peter Lim, also known as "Jaguar," also a Chinese triad member operating in the [[Visayas]] who remains at large.&lt;ref name="philstar"/&gt; According to Duterte, both Co and Colanggo are detained at the New Bilibid Prison but continue to run the drug operations of their respective groups. Peter Co was convicted for selling shabu back in 2001 while Colanggo has been serving time at the maximum security compound since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/12/18/14/philippine-crime-lord-enjoys-jailhouse-rock |title=Philippine crime lord enjoys jailhouse rock |publisher=[[ABS-CBNnews.com]] |author=Guinto, J. |date=18 December 2014 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2004/feb2004/150663.htm |title=People v. Wu Tuan Yuan, G.R. No. 150 663 |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Duterte earlier identified five Philippine National Police generals as protectors of the drug lords, he also said that his administration is investigating several other government officials and local executives as "persons of interest."&lt;ref name="philstar"/&gt;

Former Dangerous Drugs Board director and now Solicitor General [[Jose Calida]] released a photo on July 22, 2016 showing De Lima side by side with convicted inmate [[Jaybee Sebastian]] in orange prison uniform taken in a ''kubol'' inside the Bilibid. In a press conference, Calida asked the members of the media present if it was appropriate for a justice secretary to be "rubbing elbows with a convicted felon." He said the photo will be investigated, as well as  Sebastian's links to the former secretary as he vowed that "public officials who are coddling drug lords and criminals will be put to jail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/22/1605405/solgen-de-lima-clash-drugs |title=Solgen, De Lima clash on drugs |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author=Frialde, M. |date=22 July 2016 |accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, a video went viral on social media showing De Lima singing at a party with what netizens claimed to be the convicted drug lord Herbert Colanggo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/07/17/16/de-lima-denies-partying-with-drug-lord |title=De Lima denies partying with 'drug lord' |publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]] |date=17 July 2016 |accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 20–26, 2016, in the first major raids at the Bilibid since President Duterte took office, the [[Special Action Force]] troopers which took over the prison's security operations from the Bureau of Corrections jail guards, was able to confiscate {{Philippine peso|1.1 million}} worth of contraband including firearms, mobile phones, [[marijuana]] and ''shabu''.&lt;ref name="philstarsaf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/29/1607953/saf-takeover-p1.1-m-contraband-seized-bilibid |title=SAF takeover: P1.1-M contraband seized at Bilibid |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author=Viray, P.L. |date=29 July 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also discovered underground tunnels in the complex where shabu was being cooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/797935/shabu-being-cooked-in-nbp-underground-tunnels-says-aguirre |title=Shabu being cooked in NBP underground tunnels |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Torres-Tupas, T. |date=21 July 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an update to the media on the results of the investigation in the Bilibid, Secretary Aguirre revealed that at least two high-ranking former officials of the Department of Justice as well as officials of the Bureau of Corrections which he refused to name have allegedly received millions from high profile inmates for special treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/800669/ex-doj-nbp-officials-received-millions-from-bilibid-inmates/amp |title=Ex-DOJ, NBP officials received millions from Bilibid inmates–Aguirre |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Torres-Tupas, T. |date=29 July 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 2016, Duterte tagged the former Justice Secretary, now Senator Leila de Lima as being involved in the Bilibid drug trade.&lt;ref name="gma"/&gt; In the drug matrix released to the media which shows the drug trafficking operations in the prison, Duterte also identified former Pangasinan governor, now Congressman [[Amado Espino Jr.]], former Justice Undersecretary Francisco Baraan III and De Lima's former driver and alleged lover Ronnie Dayan as part of the Bilibid drug network.&lt;ref name="gma"/&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

Ronnie Dayan, then working for Secretary de Lima, was identified as the drug money collector in the Bilibid and a "case fixer" of well-known politicians in Pangasinan.&lt;ref name="philstar"/&gt; In a statement a week earlier prior to the start of the Senate probe on alleged extrajudicial killings in the current drug campaign, Duterte called de Lima "immoral" for having an affair with her driver Dayan, a married man, who he claimed collected money from the Bilibid drug lord inmates to fund her senatorial campaign.&lt;ref name="cnnph2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/08/17/Duterte-De-Lima-immoral-drug-money.html |title=Duterte blasts De Lima: Immoral, used narco money |publisher=[[CNN Philippines]] |author=Ho, A. |date=18 August 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philstar3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/08/21/1615836/duterte-de-limas-affair-caused-bilibid-irregularities |title=Duterte: De Lima's affair caused Bilibid irregularities |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author=Romero, A. |date=21 August 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president also claimed that de Lima had built a mansion for Dayan in [[Urbiztondo, Pangasinan]] from the drug protection money they collected, and that there was evidence from wiretaps and ATM records that would show that the former driver-bodyguard of de Lima transacted with drug syndicates at the New Bilibid Prison when she was Justice Secretary.&lt;ref name="cnnph2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philstar3"/&gt;

The drug matrix also links former Pangasinan governor Espino to then Justice Undersecretary Francisco "Toti" Baraan and his brother, Pangasinan administrator Raffy Baraan, whom the governor allegedly used to cover for his illegal activities. It said that both Baraan and Espino were involved in black sand mining operations in Pangasinan with Espino being charged earlier with plunder for illegal mining.&lt;ref name="gma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philstar2"/&gt; General Bucayo was identified as protector of the narco politicians who was appointed as the PNP Director for Region 1 and as the Bureau of Corrections chief through the help of Secretary de Lima.&lt;ref name="gma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philstar2"/&gt;

A certain “Ms. Cardenosa” also appears in the matrix. She is connected to Dayan and serving as the dummy for his properties. The drug matrix also shows Pangasinan Board Member Sison as connected with “Ms. Cardenosa” and Governor Espino.&lt;ref name="inq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philstar2"/&gt; [[Malacañang Palace]] Communications Secretary [[Martin Andanar]] later clarified to the media that the President's drug matrix was based on strong evidence from intelligence reports from the [[Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency]] and the Philippine National Police and that it went through thorough validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/144201-duterte-prison-drug-matrix-evidence |title=Duterte's prison drug matrix based on strong evidence – Palace |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Ranada, P. |date=25 August 2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the exposé from the President, two former National Bureau of Investigation deputy directors have come forward and said they are willing to testify against de Lima.&lt;ref name="sunstar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/davao/local-news/2016/08/30/2-former-nbi-officers-willing-testify-vs-de-lima-494524 |title=2 former NBI officers willing to testify vs de Lima |publisher=[[Sun.Star Davao]] |author=Cudis, C.J.C. |date=30 August 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two NBI officers, Reynaldo Esmeralda and Ruel Lasala, were discharged by the former Justice Secretary in March 2014 on grounds of their alleged links to the [[Priority Development Assistance Fund scam]], other "derogatory reports" about them, and being presidential appointees, they can be removed by simple loss of integrity and confidence.&lt;ref name="gma3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/352590/news/nation/de-lima-i-ve-been-warned-2-sacked-nbi-execs-will-raise-hell |title=De Lima: I've been warned 2 sacked NBI execs |publisher=[[GMA News]] |author=Merueñas, M. |date=14 March 2014 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They however claim that they were given separation orders by de Lima without due process because they were investigating her then.&lt;ref name="sunstar"/&gt;

Two former employees of the Department of Justice have also come forward to Secretary Aguirre with affidavits implicating de Lima in the Bilibid drug trade. Jonathan Caranto and Edna Obuyes, both former receiving clerks in the department under De Lima, presented bank deposit slips showing money transfers in millions of pesos to Ronnie Dayan's account. They said De Lima asked them to make those deposits. Secretary Aguirre claimed Caranto and Obuyes were not coerced into signing the affidavits and that they volunteered to testify in order to clear their names.&lt;ref name="mb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/2-doj-men-implicate-de-lima-in-bilibid-drug-trade-its-a-fabrication-senator-says/ |title=2 DOJ men implicate De Lima in Bilibid drug trade; it's a fabrication, senator says |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]] |author=Torregoza, H. |date=1 September 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gma4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/579869/news/nation/doj-in-possession-of-bank-deposit-slips-showing-money-transfers-to-dayan-s-account-aguirre |title=DOJ in possession of bank deposit slips showing money transfers to Dayan’s account – Aguirre |publisher=[[GMA News]] |author=Lopez, V. |date=2 September 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary Aguirre also bared to the media that other NBI agents, former Bureau of Corrections officials, and at least 12 high profile inmates at the New Bilibid Prison have executed sworn statements against De Lima with two of those witnesses claiming to have personally handed {{Philippine peso|5 million}} in cash to the former Justice Secretary at her house in [[Parañaque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/nbi-officials-12-high-profile-inmates-to-testify-vs-de-lima/ |title=NBI officials, 12 high profile inmates to testify vs De Lima |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]] |author=Damicog, J. |date=15 September 2016 |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/581535/news/nation/doj-chief-aguirre-witnesses-claim-de-lima-personally-received-drug-money |title=DOJ chief Aguirre: Witnesses claim De Lima personally received drug money |publisher=[[GMA News]] |date=15 September 2016 |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aguirre also announced that convicted drug lord Herbert Colanggo was among those who have executed their affidavits and who agreed to testify against De Lima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/815866/inmate-colangco-to-testify-vs-de-lima-in-houses-bilibid-drug-probe |title=Inmate Colangco to testify vs De Lima in House drug probe |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Torres-Tupas, T. |date=16 September 2016 |accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech during his visit to police officers wounded or killed in the ongoing war against drugs on August 29, 2016 in [[Tacloban]], President Duterte called for the senator to resign and said "If I were De Lima, I'll [sic] hang myself."&lt;ref name="abs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/08/29/16/duterte-tells-de-lima-resign-hang-yourself |title=Duterte tells De Lima: Resign, hang yourself |publisher=[[ABS-CBNnews.com]] |author=Placido, D. |date=29 August 2016 |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/pres-duterte-visits-killed-wounded-samar-cops/ |title=President Duterte visits killed, wounded Samar cops |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]] |author=Abrematea, N.L. |date=29 August 2016 |accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While admitting there were "snippets of truths" in those allegations, De Lima however said "the bulk of it are distortions, exaggerations, and lies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/08/20/1615230/de-lima-admits-snippets-truth |title=De Lima admits 'snippets of truth' |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author1=Sy, M. |author2=Romero, P. |date=20 August 2016 |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/08/20/De-Lima-Duterte-claims-mostly-lies.html |title=De Lima on Duterte's claims: Bits of truth - but mostly lies |publisher=[[CNN Philippines]] |author=Ho, A. |date=20 August 2016 |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The senator also said she will not take part in any inquiry on the Bilibid drug trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/808930/de-lima-wont-attend-house-probe-on-drugs-in-bilibid |title=De Lima won't attend House probe on drugs in Bilibid |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Quismundo, T. |date=23 August 2016 |accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman Espino also denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/578887/news/nation/pangasinan-rep-espino-denies-drug-links-eyes-meeting-with-duterte |title=Pangasinan Rep.

On September 27, 2016 during the inspection of the biggest shabu factory ever discovered by the PNP and PDEA in [[Arayat, Pampanga]], President Duterte cleared former Pangasinan Governor Amado Espino Jr., Provincial Administrator Rafael Baraan and Board Member Raul Sison of the charges relating to the illegal drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison, publicly apologized to them for the lapse in the validation of the intelligence report, but maintained that the charges of illegal mining against Espino and Baraan remain valid as the [[Sandiganbayan]] has already decided on the case and ordered their suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/police-pdea-seize-mega-shabu-lab-at-foot-of-mt-arayat/ |title=Police, PDEA seize mega shabu lab at foot of Mt.

Aguirre said, on 5 October, that the convicted drug lords were able to transact up to {{Philippine peso|15 billion}} worth of illegal drugs during the last two years of [[Benigno Aquino III]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=P15B narcotics transacted from Bilibid during Aquino gov’t – Aguirre|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/822258/p15b-narcotics-transacted-from-bilibid-during-aquino-govt-aguirre|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Following earlier pronouncements from Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II on alleged links of former Justice Department officials in the Bilibid trade,  [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|House Speaker]] [[Pantaleon Alvarez]] called for a resolution to probe de Lima and the alleged proliferation of drugs in the previous administration.&lt;ref name="inqalvarez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/798194/alvarez-calls-for-house-probe-on-de-lima-over-drug-problem |title=Alvarez calls for House probe on De Lima over drug problem |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Cayabyab, M.J. |date=22 July 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives [[Raneo Abu]] and Karlo Nograles authored House Resolution No. 105 calling for the investigation, in aid of legislation, which was passed by the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] on July 21, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HR00105.pdf |title=House Resolution No. 105 |publisher=[[House of Representatives of the Philippines]] |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nograles said the purpose of the inquiry was to find out how drugs were manufactured in the Bilibid as well as the connections of certain personalities in the illegal activity. Abu, on the other hand, said he wanted the inquiry to focus on the Bilibid prison raids where a shabu laboratory, high-powered firearms, other weapons and luxury items were discovered. The lawmakers also said it is the aim of the house probe to strengthen the penitentiary system by helping lawmakers to come up with measures to ensure that the national prisons would be free from drugs and corruption.&lt;ref name="cnnph3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/08/22/house-of-representatives-probe-de-lima-driver-illegal-drugs-national-bilibid-prisons-nbp.html |title=House readies to probe De Lima's alleged past drug link at Bilibid |publisher=[[CNN Philippines]] |author=Ilas, J. |date=22 August 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House Committee on Justice led by its chairman Representative Reynaldo Umali scheduled the probe beginning on September 20, 2016 with the accused Ronnie Dayan tapped as the principal resource person. Umali said that an invitation will also be sent to De Lima and that a subpoena will be issued to Dayan if he fails to attend.&lt;ref name="mb2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/dayan-tapped-as-star-witness-in-house-probe-on-drugs-at-nbp/ |title=Dayan tapped as 'star witness' in House probe on drugs at NBP |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]] |date=5 September 2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/815738/sparks-may-fly-too-at-house-probe-on-nbp-drug-trade-on-sept-20 |title=Sparks may fly too at House probe on NBP drug trade on Sept. 20 |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Cayabyab, M.J. |date=15 September 2016 |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]], an ethics complaint was filed against its member Senator Leila de Lima on August 30, 2016 following the release of the Bilibid drug matrix by President Duterte. [[Majority Floor Leader of the Senate of the Philippines|Majority Leader]] [[Tito Sotto]] who chairs the Senate ethics committee said the seven-member committee will take up the complaint from private lawyer Abelardo de Jesus on September 13, 2016.&lt;ref name="inq4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/813695/senate-ethics-committee-to-take-up-de-lima-case-tuesday |title=Senate ethics committee to take up De Lima case Tuesday |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Quismundo, T. |date=7 September 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the said hearing, [[President pro tempore of the Senate of the Philippines|President pro tempore]] [[Franklin Drilon]] questioned the Senate's jurisdiction over the case as it involves alleged illegal acts which happened before de Lima was elected senator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/senate-ethics-committee-mulls-jurisdiction-on-de-lima-complaint/ |title=Senate ethics committee mulls jurisdiction on De Lima complaint |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]] |author=Torregoza, H. |date=13 September 2016 |accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House Committee on Justice investigation===
Investigation in the House of Representatives Committee on Justice began on September 20, 2016 with the panel chair [[Oriental Mindoro]] Representative Reynaldo Umali saying the hearing is not about persecuting Senator de Lima but to get to the bottom of the proliferation of drug syndicates in the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/817079/house-panel-chair-says-bilibid-probe-not-about-de-lima |title=House panel chair says Bilibid probe not about De Lima |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Cayabyab, M.J. |date=20 September 2016 |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary Aguirre requested for legislative immunity for the witnesses who will testify which was granted by House Speaker Alvarez after no objections were raised by the committee members present.&lt;ref name="probe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/817070/speaker-grants-immunity-to-convicts-testifying-vs-de-lima |title=Speaker grants immunity to convicts testify vs De Lima |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Cayabyab, M.J. |date=20 September 2016 |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Justice then presented the 2013 [[Discovery Channel]] documentary "Inside the Gangsters' Code" which featured the gangs controlling the Bilibid and their illegal drug operations both in and out of the maximum security prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/20/16/bilibid-docu-inside-the-gangsters-code-a-star-at-house-hearing |title=Bilibid docu 'Inside the Gangster's Code' a star at House hearing |publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]] |date=20 September 2016 |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show also featured an interview by the host [[Louis Ferrante]] with gang leader [[Jaybee Sebastian]] in his kubol where he showed his office where he operated his own television network as well as his pictures with prominent government officials including Justice Secretary De Lima.&lt;ref name="gangstercode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/582024/news/nation/bilibid-gang-leader-shows-picture-with-de-lima-to-docu-show-host |title='Bilibid' gang leader shows picture with De Lima to docu show host |publisher=[[GMA News]] |author=Merueñas, M. |date=20 September 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After which, the Special Action Force presented their accomplishments and the changes in the Bilibid since taking over its security operations on July 20, 2016.&lt;ref name="probe"/&gt;

By the end of the House probe on November 24, 2016, the following resource persons have presented their testimonies at the committee: Bilibid inmates Herbert Colanggo, Noel Martinez, Rodolfo Magleo, Jaime Patcho, Jojo Baligad, Froilan Trestiza, Hans Anthony Tan, Peter Co and Jaybee Sebastian; NBI officers Rafael Ragos and Jovencio Ablen; PNP Deputy Director Benjamin Magalong; and former security aides Joenel Sanchez and Ronnie Dayan.&lt;ref name="probe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Nation&amp;title=witnesses-drug-money-behind-de-lima&amp;8217s-senatorial-campaign&amp;id=133765 |title=Witnesses: Drug money behind de Lima’s senatorial campaign |publisher=[[BusinessWorld]] |author=Javil, R.F. |date=22 September 2016 |accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Colanggo's testimony====
Herbert Colanggo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/video/news/09/20/16/watch-herbert-colanggo-explains-confusion-over-colangco|title=WATCH: Herbert Colanggo explains confusion over 'Colangco'|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=September 20, 2016|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the ''Bilibid 19'' or the high profile drug lord inmates that were found to be living in luxury ''kubol''s in 2014, exposed the ''PR payola'' being paid to several government officials in exchange for special treatment and for being able to bring in contraband in the prison. He testified that he had remitted {{Philippine peso|3 million}} per month to then Secretary De Lima since October 2013 and an additional {{Philippine peso|1 million}} whenever he held concerts in the Bilibid.&lt;ref name="colangco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/582056/news/nation/colangco-i-talked-to-de-lima-gave-p3m-a-month-to-her-campaign |title=Colangco: I talked to De Lima, gave P3M a month to her campaign |publisher=[[GMA News]] |author=Merueñas, M. |date=20 September 2016 |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said De Lima's security aide Jonel Sanchez regularly collected the bribe money in his kubol which he said came from his earnings from his lending business, selling beer in prison, bringing in women prostitutes and selling them to inmates at a high price, and the concerts and other events he organized in Bilibid with his manager Renante Diaz.&lt;ref name="colangco3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dzrhnews.com/colangco-holds-alleged-receipt-de-limas-staff/ |title=Colangco holds alleged receipt from De Lima's staff |publisher=[[DZRH|DZRH News]] |author=Salonga, R. |date=20 September 2016 |accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colanggo then presented to the committee the mobile number that was used by Sanchez to call De Lima in January 2014 when he was able to speak to the then justice secretary to confirm if she was receiving the payments. De Lima supposedly answered "Okay, okay. Thank you."&lt;ref name="colangco"/&gt; Secretary Aguirre then informed the House panel that they have secured a certification from Department of Justice confirming that the number provided by Colanggo was indeed registered to De Lima.&lt;ref name="colangco"/&gt; Colangco also presented to the committee the receipts from his payments to De Lima's bagman, Sanchez which his manager Diaz sent via M Lhuillier remittance center.&lt;ref name="colangco3"/&gt;

Colanggo also narrated his encounter with [[Jaybee Sebastian]], who he said was chairman or leader that controlled the other half of the Bilibid business. He said Sebastian approached him for help in raising funds for De Lima's senatorial campaign by selling [[methamphetamine]]. Joenel Sanchez followed up on this request and reminded Colanggo about the instruction to push at least 10 kilos of shabu per month. Colanggo eventually agreed to the deal. He was also asked by Ronnie Dayan (who was De Lima's bagman assigned to Sebastian) to collect 30 to 50 kilos of illegal drugs from Chinese drug lords without paying them but that he did not agree to it.&lt;ref name="colangco2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/146759-colangco-de-lima-payola-drugs |title=Colanggo: I gave De Lima 'payola' |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Cupin, B. |date=20 September 2016 |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colanggo said that during the December 15, 2014 prison raid led by Secretary de Lima, he was one of those who were transferred to the NBI detention which he said he did not expect because he was already giving {{Philippine peso|3 million}} to the secretary. He approached De Lima to say that he was already agreeing to Ronnie Dayan's request so long as he is not transferred. He said De Lima's reply to him was "Got it, got it" which was quickly followed by "Herbert, you'll be temporarily placed here." However, Colanggo said he was detained at the NBI for 8 months, and said it was to allow Jaybee Sebastian to control the whole Bilibid drug operations.&lt;ref name="colangco2"/&gt;

Colanggo also told the committee that {{Philippine peso|1.2 million}} payola was paid monthly to then Bureau of Corrections chief Franklin Bucayo since 2013 which was coursed through Colonel Ely. He said he also gave {{Philippine peso|500,000}} to Justice Undersecretary Francisco Baraan through his aide Susan for every inmate that pays to be transferred from medium security to the comforts of the maximum security compound.&lt;ref name="colangco"/&gt;

====Ragos' and Ablen's testimonies====
[[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] director and former [[Bureau of Corrections (Philippines)|Bureau of Corrections]] (BuCor) officer-in-charge Rafael Ragos' testimony revealed the delivery of millions of drug money at De Lima's house in [[Parañaque]]. Ragos testified that he personally handed {{Philippine peso|5 million}} in cash to Ronnie Dayan at the secretary's residence on November 24, 2012.&lt;ref name="ragos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/146782-witnesses-quota-de-lima-house-probe-bilibid-drugs |title=Bilibid probe witnesses: We delivered P5-M 'quota' to De Lima |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Cepeda, M. |date=20 September 2016 |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money was placed inside a black handbag which Ragos found in the BuCor's office. He asked NBI intelligence agent Jovencio Ablen to accompany him to Parañaque after receiving the instruction. Ablen, who was then working with Ragos on the investigation in the Bilibid explosion a week before, said Ragos told him that they were bringing the ''quota'' to the Grandmother (''Lola'') and that it was from Peter Co. He was also told that it was confidential and that only the two of them know. Upon arriving at De Lima's house, Ablen saw Ragos hand over the bag to Dayan with De Lima waiting from the main door. He also saw Ragos entered the house with Dayan and De Lima.&lt;ref name="ragos"/&gt;

Ragos and Ablen also said they made a second delivery at De Lima's house in mid-December 2012. They said the money this time was placed in a translucent plastic bag and that it was again from Peter Co.&lt;ref name="ragos"/&gt;

====Magalong's testimony====
On the second day of the hearing at the House committee, Secretary Aguirre presented as witness Philippine National Police deputy chief Benjamin Magalong who previously headed the PNP [[Criminal Investigation and Detection Group]] (CIDG). In his sworn statement, Magalong bared the details of the aborted Oplan ''Cronus'' which was supposed to conduct the prison raid in the Bilibid in 2014.&lt;ref name="magalong"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/582218/news/nation/magalong-bucor-chief-was-against-drug-raid-in-bilibid-during-de-lima-s-term |title=Magalong: BuCor chief was against drug raid in Bilibid during De Lima's term |publisher=[[GMA News]] |author=Marcelo, E. |date=21 September 2016 |accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magalong, who was appointed CIDG chief in December 2013, said he proposed the case operation plan to then Secretary De Lima in May 2014 after his team's findings from recent illegal drug arrests point to the New Bilibid Prison as source. He said that during his first meeting with De Lima at her office in the DOJ, he noticed a diagram of Bilibid personalities written on her white board.&lt;ref name="magalong2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/146902-pnp-excluded-bilibid-raid-house-probe |title=Why was CIDG excluded from 2014 Bilibid raid |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Cupin, B. |date=21 September 2016 |accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeded to inform De Lima that most of the drug pushers they have arrested had dealings with inmates of the Bilibid. Before the meeting ended, Magalong told her "we have to raid NBP because that is where drug trade is happening." The secretary reportedly responded by saying she will call for an inter-agency meeting.&lt;ref name="magalong"/&gt;

According to Magalong, four "discreet" inter-agency meetings were held to discuss and plan the raid between May and September 2014 which included the top officials of the CIDG, [[Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency]], National Bureau of Investigation, and the Intelligence Service of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (ISAFP).&lt;ref name="magalong"/&gt; Magalong narrated their first inter-agency meeting with De Lima on his proposed ''Cronus'' plan. He said he was surprised to see then Bureau of Corrections officer Rafael Ragos when no BuCor officials were supposed to be at the meeting. After pointing it out to De Lima, he said the secretary also appeared surprised and asked Ragos to leave. In another meeting, then BuCor chief Franklin Bucayu was permitted to sit in where he supposedly tried to discourage the PNP-CIDG from pushing through with the plan saying "You'll have a hard time." In a separate private meeting with Bucayo and then Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) chief Reginald Villasanta, Magalong said Bucayo pleaded him not to carry out the raid saying "Benjie, I'm going to die!" &lt;ref name="magalong2"/&gt; He told Bucayo to talk to the secretary about his concern but that he would still proceed with preparing the operation. At the conclusion of the inter-agency planning, he said he was instructed by De Lima to just wait for the joint Letter of Instruction from her and then [[Secretary of the Interior and Local Government (Philippines)|Secretary of the Interior and Local Government]] [[Mar Roxas]].&lt;ref name="magalong"/&gt;

At a rare meeting with the secretary in an event after the planning sessions ended, Magalong said he approached De Lima to follow up on the instruction letter. He told her he was willing to be the ground commander for the operation to raid Bilibid, but the secretary again told him "Let's just wait, Benjie."&lt;ref name="magalong2"/&gt; Months have passed and no letter of instruction arrived. Magalong said he was shocked upon learning De Lima already carried out the Bilibid raid under a different plan (''Oplan Galugad'') on December 15, 2014. He expressed to the committee his dismay at being left out in the operation he proposed and planned with other PNP-CIDG and PDEA officers. Magalong said those who carried out the December 15 raid were only De Lima, Bucayo, Villasanta and General Marcelo Garbo of ISAFP with units of the PNP SAF and NCRPO (National Capital Region Police Office) as their main force.&lt;ref name="magalong"/&gt; He added that none of them who were part of the planning in the CIDG and PDEA (except their [[Police dog|K-9]] dogs) were asked to take part or even advised.&lt;ref name="magalong2"/&gt; Magalong also expressed his frustration after finding out that some of the personalities inside the Bilibid were not included in the transfer to the NBI detention. Under the ''Cronus'' plan, he said the CIDG and PNP were supposed to raid one part of the prison controlled by Herbert Colanggo, while the other area controlled by Jaybee Sebastian would be raided by the PDEA and NBI. The high profile convicts would have also been brought and isolated in either [[Palawan]] or [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Zamboanga]]. He said none of them were implemented.&lt;ref name="magalong2"/&gt;

====Sanchez's testimony====
Presidential Security Guard Joenel Sanchez, who was assigned as security aide of then Justice Secretary Leila de Lima for five years, testified before the House Committee of Justice on October 6, 2016. In his testimony, Sanchez claimed that De Lima indeed had an affair with Ronnie Dayan, who was accused of receiving bribes from drug lords in the Bilibid.&lt;ref name="sanchez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/10/06/16/ex-bodyguard-affirms-de-limas-alleged-affair-with-dayan |title=Ex-bodyguard affirms De Lima's alleged affair with Dayan |publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]] |date=6 October 2016 |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the former justice secretary and her driver had mobile phone recordings of their sexual acts which he and other security aides have personally seen and that their relationship ended in May 2015 when another close-in security aide, Warren Cristobal, replaced Dayan as head of her security team.&lt;ref name="sanchez"/&gt;

On accusations by inmate Herbert Colanggo of serving as a bagman for De Lima, Sanchez claimed that he did know his manager Renante Diaz through his colleague Vic Mercado. While he denied that he received any money from Colanggo, Sanchez admitted that he often delivered Colanggo's "letter requests" and concert invites to De Lima.&lt;ref name="sanchez"/&gt; He also admitted to receiving a total of {{Philippine peso|15,000}} from Renante Diaz in three instances.&lt;ref name="sanchez"/&gt;

====Sebastian's testimony====
On October 10, 2016, [[Jaybee Sebastian]] testified before the House Committee on Justice two weeks after he was injured in the [[2016 New Bilibid Prison riot]]. A key witness in the Bilibid drug trade who was allegedly the most influential inmate during the previous administration due to his links to the former Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, Sebastian denied De Lima's earlier claim that he was forced to testify in the committee or that he was working as a government asset of the present administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/148725-jaybee-sebastian-denial-government-asset |title=Jaybee Sebastian denies De Lima claim: I'm no gov't asset |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Cupin, B. |date=10 October 2016 |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed he was actually stabbed inside the Bilibid by inmates connected to De Lima, one of whom he identified as convict ex-Chief Inspector Clarence Dongail, to prevent him from testifying before the House Committee.&lt;ref name="sebastian2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/584445/news/nation/sebastian-i-gave-p10-m-drug-money-to-de-lima-mostly-through-aide?related |title=Sebastian: I gave P10-M drug money to De Lima, mostly through aide |publisher=[[GMA News]] |author=Merueñas, M. |date=10 October 2016 |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his testimony after being granted an immunity from suit by the House Speaker, Sebastian claims De Lima was the drug protector in the Bilibid and that he did raise funds to help bankroll her senatorial bid for the [[Philippine Senate election, 2016|May 2016 Senate elections]].&lt;ref name="sebastian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/10/10/1632225/sebastian-claims-de-lima-was-protector-bilibid-drug-trade |title=Sebastian claims De Lima was protector of Bilibid drug trade |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author1=Cervantes, M.Z. |author2=Adel, R. |date=10 October 2016 |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he had given a total of {{Philippine peso|10 million}} to De Lima mostly through her security aide, Joenel Sanchez, whom he also claimed was romantically linked to the former Justice secretary. He went on to describe De Lima's relationship with Sanchez whom he saw were holding hands in the Bilibid and whose term of endearment for each other was "Sweetie."&lt;ref name="sebastian"/&gt; He claimed to have spoken with De Lima around twelve times during this whole transaction and that his first drug money amounting to {{Philippine peso|2 million}} was remitted to Sanchez right after the [[2014 New Bilibid Prison raids|December 2014 Bilibid raid]]. In his first phone call to De Lima after the raid, Sebastian recalled asking the secretary if she already received the "gift." The secretary allegedly replied "Yes, Jaybee. Merry Christmas." In January 2015, Sebastian said he personally gave another {{Philippine peso|2 million}} to De Lima herself at the office of Bureau of Corrections chief Franklin Bucayu where he was told by De Lima to just leave the money as Sanchez was not around. Between March and May 2015, Sebastian claimed he was able to raise another {{Philippine peso|6 million}} drug money and gave it to Sanchez at his Bilibid TV3 office. He said the stash of money composed of {{Philippine peso|1,000}} bills, were placed in paper bags.&lt;ref name="sebastian2"/&gt;

Sebastian confessed to the Committee that the millions of pesos he raised for De Lima was sourced entirely from the illegal drug trade. When asked by [[Compostela Valley]] Representative Peter Gonzaga about the role of Leila de Lima in the Bilibid trade, he said she was more of a protector than a conspirator in the drug trade.&lt;ref name="sebastian"/&gt; He added that De Lima  was "aware that the source of money originated from drugs. We don't have any other source."&lt;ref name="sebastian"/&gt; Sebastian also explained that the illegal drug trade in the New Bilibid Prison had become so rampant that inmates exchange {{Philippine peso|50 million}} to {{Philippine peso|100 million}} a day in illegal transactions right inside the national prison.&lt;ref name="sebastian2"/&gt; Towards the end of the hearing, Sebastian said he was willing to undergo a [[lie detector test]] to prove his claims regarding the illegal drug trade at the Bilibid Prison.&lt;ref name="sebastian2"/&gt;

====Dayan's testimony====
[[File:Ronald dela Rosa and Ronnie Dayan.jpg|thumb|Ronnie Dayan at a press conference with PNP Chief [[Ronald dela Rosa]] following his arrest]]
The House Committee on Justice resumed its probe on the Bilibid drug trade after the arrest of Ronnie Dayan, De Lima's former driver, bodyguard and lover, on November 22, 2016 in [[San Juan, La Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/153199-ronnie-dayan-arrested-la-union-de-lima-driver-bodyguard-alleged-bagman |title=De Lima's ex-aide Ronnie Dayan arrested |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Cupin, B. |date=22 November 2016 |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Representatives has ordered Dayan's arrest since October 10, 2016 after he was cited in contempt for failing to appear in the October 6th hearing where he has been implicated by witnesses as De Lima's bagman in the Bilibid drug trade. On November 24, 2016, during the resumption of the Bilibid probe at the House Committee on Justice, Dayan explained his decision to hide and not appear before the House Committee. He said he was following Senator Leila de Lima's advise not to show up in the House hearing.&lt;ref name="dayan2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mb.com.ph/2016/11/24/de-lima-under-contempt-threat-for-preventing-dayans-testimony/ |title=De Lima under contempt threat for preventing Dayan's testimony |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]] |author=Rosario, B. |date=24 November 2016 |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, Hanna Mae, was then presented to confirm his claim. She showed to the committee members the two [[Viber]] messages sent on October 1 by De Lima, whom she called "Tita Lei" (Aunt Lei), which she saved in her smartphone. It read "Please tell (Dayan) to go into hiding in the mean time. This is all Speaker Alvarez's fault and dictated by Digong (President Duterte)." She went on to say "They will only feast on him (Dayan), and me and him, if he appears in the hearing."&lt;ref name="dayan2"/&gt; Hanna Mae also presented De Lima's message sent later that day when she asked if her father will get arrested if he does not show up in the hearing. The senator responded "Isn't he really hiding in the first place?"&lt;ref name="dayan2"/&gt; 

In his four-page affidavit which he said he was not forced to execute nor was he rewarded for by the government, Ronnie Dayan admitted his relationship with De Lima and narrated his experience working for the former Justice secretary.&lt;ref name="dayan3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/590033/news/nation/dayan-no-reward-not-forced-to-execute-affidavit-vs-de-lima |title=Dayan: No reward, not forced to execute affidavit vs. De Lima |publisher=[[GMA News]] |author=Arcangel, X. |date=24 November 2016 |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said their 7-year relationship started in 2007, two to three months after he was hired as driver and bodyguard in De Lima's law firm in [[Quezon City]]. He said De Lima was aware that he was married since 1991 and that he had kids. He also claimed that De Lima's oldest son knew about their relationship. He said they were together when she moved to the [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]] in 2008 and started living in with her in [[Parañaque]] when she transferred to the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] in 2010. Dayan also admitted that the money to build his house in [[Urbiztondo, Pangasinan]] came from De Lima in 2007, {{Philippine peso|120,000}} for the lot and {{Philippine peso|2 million}} for the house.&lt;ref name="dayan3"/&gt;

As close-in security of De Lima, Dayan narrated his duties at the Bilibid prison. He said he accompanied De Lima inside the maximum security compound several times but that he was eventually replaced by Joenel Sanchez and other Presidential Security Guards from [[Malacañang Palace]].&lt;ref name="dayan3"/&gt; On accusations by then Bureau of Corrections chief Rafael Ragos of receiving {{Philippine peso|5 million}} in drug money on behalf of De Lima, Dayan denied getting such amount for himself, but admitted there were two occasions when he saw Ragos hand over an envelope and a plastic bag, which he thought contained a box of shoes, to the Justice secretary De Lima.&lt;ref name="dayan3"/&gt; He said Ragos used him as a bridge to De Lima for his promotion in the Bureau of Corrections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/24/16/nbis-ragos-made-2-mystery-deliveries-to-de-lima-dayan |title=NBI's Ragos made 2 mystery deliveries to De Lima: Dayan |publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]] |author=Punzalan, J. |date=24 November 2016 |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dayan however denied knowing any of the Bilibid inmates or receiving any money from them.&lt;ref name="dayan3"/&gt;

On accusations by self-confessed drug lord Kerwin Espinosa during a parallel [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] Committee on Justice probe on the [[Death of Rolando Espinosa]] the day before that he received his millions of drug money on behalf of De Lima, Dayan confessed that he did receive those money from Espinosa on five separate occasions in 2014.&lt;ref name="dayan4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/590024/news/nation/kerwin-espinosa-gave-de-lima-money-five-times-in-2014-dayan |title=Kerwin Espinosa gave De Lima money five times in 2014 —Dayan |publisher=[[GMA News]] |author=Merueñas, M. |date=24 November 2016 |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money amounting to {{Philippine peso|8 million}} that Kerwin claimed was for De Lima's 2016 senatorial bid, was disbursed in different tranches to Dayan.&lt;ref name="kerwin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/11/23/Self-confessed-drug-dealer-Kerwin-Espinosa-I-gave-₱8M-to-De-Limas-campaign-senator-denies-allegation.html |title=Self-confessed drug dealer Kerwin Espinosa: I gave ₱8M to De Lima's campaign; senator denies allegation |publisher=[[CNN Philippines]] |author=Santos, E.P. |date=23 November 2016 |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dayan claimed that while he thought Kerwin was an engineer who was one of De Lima's campaign donors as what he had been told, he did meet with Kerwin for the first delivery in August 2014 at the parking lot of the [[SM Mall of Asia]] in [[Pasay]]. He said Kerwin approached him in his car with a paper bag and said, "This is for Ma'am."&lt;ref name="dayan4"/&gt; They met again in October 2014 and two times in November 2014 at the same place. Dayan said he was always alone whenever he would meet with Kerwin and that he automatically handed them over to De Lima at her house and straight in her own room, in secret.&lt;ref name="dayan4"/&gt; Despite the discrepancy in the dates of their meetings, Dayan also confirmed Kerwin's testimony that they had met in [[Burnham Park (Philippines)|Burnham Park]] in [[Baguio]] with Leila de Lima before the elections. He said he received the money from Kerwin after this meeting at the parking lot of the Alexandria Residence where Kerwin was staying.&lt;ref name="dayan3"/&gt;

==Reaction==
[[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Leni Robredo]] criticized President Duterte's tirade against party mate Senator Leila de Lima. In a statement released by the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], the party stressed that the senator should be given support and not be condemned or disrespected. Robredo urged the government to "stick to issues" as "personal attacks don't help."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/143463-robredo-liberal-party-support-de-lima-against-duterte |title=Robredo, LP back De Lima: Personal attacks don't help |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Pasion, P. |date=18 August 2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] also came to Senator Leila de Lima's defense and expressed alarm over people's reaction to the public shaming by Duterte. CBCP Public Affairs executive secretary Fr. Jerome Secillano gave this reaction after the President called de Lima "immoral" for her relationship with her married driver and alleged Bilibid drug money collector. He said "It’s as if what the President did was perfectly fine. When Mr. Duterte himself was called names by his detractors, people came to his defense and bullied his critics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/ccbcp-expresses-alarm-on-peoples-reaction-to-president-dutertes-attack-vs-de-lima/ |title=CCBCP expresses alarm on people’s reaction to President Duterte’s attack vs. De Lima |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]] |author=19 August 2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]] [[Aquilino Pimentel III]] said Congress should respect Senator Leila de Lima's decision not to attend the House investigation and cited inter-parliamentary courtesy extended to members of both Houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestandard.com.ph/news/-main-stories/214218/de-lima-s-appearance-in-house-probe-on-drugs-not-required-.html |title=Pimentel: De Lima's appearance in House probe on drugs not required |publisher=[[The Standard (Philippines)|The Standard]] |author=Lim, A. |date=24 August 2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, Pimentel rejected calls for a Senate probe saying "we have no business investigating anybody in the Senate" unless an actual complaint or resolution is filed calling for an investigation of any one of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/24/1606066/no-reason-senate-probe-de-lima-koko |title=No reason for Senate to probe De Lima – Koko |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author=Sy, M. |date=24 July 2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former President and [[Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Deputy Speaker]] [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] expressed her support for the congressional probe on the Bilibid drug trade. In her first press conference since her release from four years of detention, Arroyo stated that she was "very confident that due process is going to be pursued, unlike the time I was being persecuted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/812985/arroyo-says-de-lima-to-enjoy-due-process-in-bilibid-probe |title=Arroyo says De Lima to enjoy due process in Bilibid probe |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Cayabyab, M.J. |date=5 September 2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54649">[[File:Nursing home corridor.JPG|thumb|Nursing shortage is a problem in several districts of [[Norway]]. This nurse is employed at a [[nursing home]].]]
'''Nursing shortage''' refers to a situation where the demand for [[nurse|nursing professionals]], such as [[Registered Nurse]]s (RNs), exceeds the supply—locally (e.g., within a [[health care provider|health care facility]]), nationally or globally. It can be measured, for instance, when the nurse-to-[[patient]] ratio, the nurse-to-population ratio, or the number of [[Job (role)|job openings]] necessitates a higher number of nurses than currently available. This situation is observed in developed and developing nations around the world.

Nursing shortage is not necessarily due to a lack of supply of trained nurses. In some cases, perceived shortages occur simultaneously with increased admission rates of students into [[nursing school]]s. Potential factors include lack of adequate staffing ratios in [[hospital]]s and other health care facilities, lack of placement programs for newly trained nurses, and inadequate worker retention incentives.&lt;ref&gt;Goulette, C. "Nursing (Job) Shortage. New Grads are finding the Job Hunt Tough." Advance for Nurses. Issue January 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates a shortage of almost 4.3 million nurses, physicians and other [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]] worldwide—reported to be the result of decades of underinvestment in health worker education, training, wages, working environment and management.&lt;ref name="who2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2006|title=The world health report 2006 - working together for health|website=who.int|location= Geneva|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Nursing shortage is an issue in many countries. To remedy the problem, psychological studies have been completed to ascertain how nurses feel about their [[career]] in the hope that they can determine what is preventing some nurses from keeping the profession as a long-term career. In a study completed by sociologist Bryan Turner, the study found that the most common nursing complaints were: 
* subordination to the medical profession on all matters, even over standardized regulations
* difficult working conditions
A report from the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] identified a few other matters that led to nurse dissatisfaction: 
* constant schedule changes
* work overloads due to high number of patients and paperwork
* shift work
* lack of appreciation by superiors
* lack of provided [[childcare]]
* inadequate pay
Another study found that nurse dissatisfaction stemmed from:
* conflicting expectations from nurses and managers due to regulation of cost
* inability to provide comprehensive nursing care due to work 
* loss of confidence in the health care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why a career in Nursing?|url=http://www.nursestraining-visa.ru/eng/careersEng.html |accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions, administrative/government [[health policy]] and practice has changed very little in the last decades. Cost-cutting is the priority, patient loads are uncontrolled, and nurses are rarely consulted when recommending [[health care reform]].&lt;ref name="mitchell2003"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12876879 | doi=10.1177/0894318403016003011 | volume=16 | title=Nursing shortage or nursing famine: looking beyond numbers? | author=Mitchell GJ | journal=Nurs Sci Q | pages=219–24 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major reason nurses plan to leave the field, as stated by the First Consulting Group, is because of working conditions.&lt;ref name="stoneetal2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stone |first1=P. W. |last2=Clarke |first2=S. |last3=Cimiotti |first3=J. |last4=Correa-de-Araujo |first4=R. |date=November 2004 |url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/11/04-0253_article |title=Nurses' working conditions: implications for infectious disease |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=1984–1989 |doi=10.3201/eid1011.040253}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the high [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] rate, the nursing field does not have a chance to build up the already frustrated staff. Aside from the deteriorating working conditions, the real problem is "nursing’s failure to be attractive to the younger generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Christiane |last1=Wiskow|first2=Tit|last2=Albreht|first3= Carlo|last3=de Pietro|title=How to create an attractive and supportive working environment for health professionals" Health Systems and Policy Analysis|url= http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/124416/e94293.pdf|format=PDF|website=euro.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; There’s a decline in interest among college students to consider nursing as a probable [[career]]. More than half of currently working [[nurses]] "would not recommend nursing to their own children" and a little less than a quarter would advise others to avoid this as a profession altogether.&lt;ref name="wieck2003"&gt;Wieck, K. L. (2003). Faculty for the millennium: changes needed to attract the emerging workforce into nursing. [Electronic Version]" ''Journal of Nursing Education'' 42(4), 151-8. Retrieved October 25, 2006 from Pubmed (12710805).&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian nursing researchers John Buchanan and Gillian Considine described [[hospitals]] as "being run like a business" with "issues of patient care… of secondary importance."&lt;ref name="forsythmckenzie2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Forsyth S., McKenzie H. | year = 2006 | title = A comparative analysis of contemporary nurses' discontents. [Electronic Version] | url = | journal = Journal of Advanced Nursing | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 209–216 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2006.03999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional support, education, encouragement and counseling are integral to the everyday nursing practice. However, these practices are not easily quantified and are considered by managers as unjustified cost for the [[patients]], who are viewed as [[consumer]]s.&lt;ref name="forsythmckenzie2006"/&gt; Therefore, only clinical responsibilities, such as [[medication]] administration, dressing changes, [[foley catheter]] insertions, and anything that involves tangible supplies, are quantified and incorporated into the organization budget and plan of care for the [[consumer]]s.

The nursing shortage affects the developing countries that supply nurses through [[recruitment]] to work abroad in wealthier countries.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brush|first1= B. L.|last2= Sochalski|first2= J.|last3= Berger|first3= A. M. |year=2004|title= Imported care: recruiting foreign nurses to U.S. health care facilities. (Electronic Version) à Health Affairs, 23(3), 78-87 |accessdate=October 26, 2006 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/23/3/78?ijkey=82040093f179b956b3b2d1769736a1c23040fad0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, to accommodate perceived nursing shortage in the United States, American hospital recruit nurses from overseas, especially the [[Philippines]] and [[Africa]]. This, in turn, can lead to greater nursing shortages in their home countries. In response, in 2010 the WHO's [[World Health Assembly]] adopted the ''[[Health Human Resources#Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel|Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel]]'', a policy framework for all countries for the ethical international recruitment of nurses and other health professionals.

===Impacts on healthcare===
Nursing shortages (including low hospital-level nurse-to-patient ratios)&lt;ref name="ARHQ2004"&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]]|title=Hospital Nurse Staffing and Quality of Care: Research in Action, Issue 14|url=http://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/factsheets/services/nursestaffing/nursestaff.html|publisher=[[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]]|accessdate=4 September 2017|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been linked to the following effects:&lt;ref name="stoneetal2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARHQ2004"/&gt;
*Increased nurses’ patient workloads
*Increased risk for error, thereby compromising [[patient safety]]
*Increased risk of spreading [[infection]] to patients and staff
*Increased risk of adverse outcomes such as [[pneumonia]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], [[cardiac arrest]], and [[urinary tract infection]]s&lt;ref name="ARHQ2004"/&gt;
*Increased risk for occupational [[injury]]
*Increase in nursing turnover, thereby leading to greater costs for the employer and the health care system
*Increase in nurses' perception of unsafe working conditions, contributing to increased shortage and hindering local or national [[recruitment]] efforts

==Global shortage and international recruitment==
The nursing shortage takes place on a global scale. Australia, the UK, and the US receive the largest number of migrant nurses. Australia received 11,757 nurses from other countries between 1995 and 2000.&lt;ref name="pushandpull"/&gt; The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) records show that more than 10,000 foreign nurses were given H-1A visas in the same time frame.&lt;ref name="pushandpull"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kline Donna S | year = 2003 | title = Push and Pull Factors in International Nurse Migration | url = | journal = Journal of Nursing Scholarship | volume = 35 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.K. admitted 26,286 foreign nurses from 1998 to 2002.

Saudi Arabia also depends on the international nurse supply with 40 nations represented in its nurse workforce.&lt;ref name="pushandpull"/&gt; [[Netherlands]] needed to fill 7,000 nursing positions in 2002, [[England]] needed to fill 22,000 positions in 2000, and [[Canada]] would need about 10,000 nursing graduates by 2011.&lt;ref name="trossman2002"/&gt;

In an [[American Hospital Association]] study, the cost to replace one [[nurse]] in the U.S. was estimated at around $30,000–$64,000.&lt;ref name="stoneetal2004"/&gt; This amount is likely related to the cost of recruiting and training nurses into the organization. Hiring foreign nurses is more financially taxing compared to hiring domestic-graduate nurses; however, facilities save money in the long run because foreign nurses have a contractual obligation to complete their term.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt; The [[Joint Commission|JACHO]] in the United States wrote in a 2002 research report on the shortage in the US that recruiting foreign trained nurses from abroad (not referring to those who reside in the United States already) does not help the global nursing shortage and, in fact, perpetuates it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Joint Commission]]|url=http://www.jointcommission.org/NR/rdonlyres/5C138711-ED76-4D6F-909F-B06E0309F36D/0/health_care_at_the_crossroads.pdf|format=PDF|title=Health Care at the Crossroads: Strategies for Addressing the Evolving Nursing Crisis|location= Washington, D.C. |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries that send their nurses abroad experience a shortage and strain on their [[health care system]]s.

In [[South Africa]], accelerated [[recruitment]] by developed countries such as [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] has placed more pressure on the health care system due to prevalence of [[diseases]], such as [[AIDS]], and limited resources.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt; Similar to the U.S., [[nurses]] who leave the organization are a financial disadvantage due to the need to fund recruiting and retraining of new nurses into the system. It has been estimated that every [[nurse]] who leaves South Africa is an annual loss of $184,000 to the country,&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt; related to the financial and economical impact of the nursing shortage.

The following table represents the number of nurses per 100,000-population in southern African countries.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt;

In India international migration has been considered as one of the reasons behind shortages of nursing workforce. Social, economic and professional reasons have been cited behind this shortfall.&lt;ref name="Gill2003"&gt;Gill, Reema. (2011). Nursing Shortage in India with special reference to International Migration of Nurses. Social Medicine, 6(1), 52-59. Retrieved June 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retention of nurses by sending (often developing) countries can be addressed by improving working conditions, minimizing wage differentials, and promoting medical tourism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Retention can also be promoted through educational activities to improve job satisfaction. There can be additional unintended impacts of nurses migration abroad. For example, there is growing evidence that [[physicians]] in the [[Philippines]] have shifted to the nursing field for better export opportunities.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) representative in Manila believes the government should invest more into its health sector as it is 3% of the Philippines' GDP.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Others have suggested programs which require domestic service or employment upon graduation.

===Ethical concerns===
{{editorial|section|date=October 2015}}
Foreign nurses that migrate from developing countries to fill the nursing shortage of developed nations pursue their own economic, career, and lifestyle interests, but there are risks. The media and scholars have remained relatively silent on the ethical concerns involving the potential exploitation of foreign nurses.{{According to whom|date=October 2015}} On the level of national sovereignty and global equality, there are ethical concerns about the pull of developed nations on developing countries' skilled workers and assets. U.S. incentives such as signing bonuses can be seen as promoting [[brain drain]]. Activists have spread a new term for this: "Brain drain in the south, brain waste in the north."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manalansan|first= Ely |title=Brain Drain Refrain|website=bulatlat.com|date= 1 February 2003|accessdate=29 April 2010|url=http://bulatlat.com/news/2-50/2-50-braindrain.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the Philippines Nurse Association, George Codero, was quoted in a ''New York Times'' article as saying "The Filipino people will suffer because the U.S. will get all our trained nurses".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/world/americas/24nurses.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0 U.S. Plan to Lure Nurses May Hurt Poor Nations], ''New York Times'', May 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curranberger1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Nurse Migration - Curran and Berger LLP Immigration Law|date=5 May 2010|url=http://curranberger.com/content/view/58/98/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On an individual basis, foreign nurses are subject to exploitation by employers. In 1998 six Americans were charged with falsely obtaining H-1A visas and using them to employ Filipino nurses as nurse aides instead of registered nurses.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In a case in 1996, a Catholic archdiocese employed some of these foreign nurses as nurse aides instead of nurses. In 2000, Filipino nurses in Missouri received $2.1 million for failure to receive proper wages that an American in the same position would receive. While these cases were brought to court, many similar situations are left unreported thereby jeopardizing the rights of foreign nurses. Foreign nurses have the tendency to receive less desirable jobs, such as entry-level positions, because of their immigrant status; they are excluded from jobs that would lead to facilities and are often not paid proper salaries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Some U.S. health care facilities push to "ease restrictions" on the [[immigration]] law to increase the number of recruited foreign [[nurses]]. On the other hand, this [[recruitment]] practice is a temporary solution that does not fully address the nursing shortage as mentioned by [[American Nursing Association]] (ANA).&lt;ref name="trossman2002" /&gt; Others have taken a stand on ethically recruiting foreign workers. New York University Medical Center was cited in ''The Search for Nurses Ends in Manila'' as believing that it is a "poaching exercise" to take nurses from countries in need of their citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ching|first= Cheryl D. |title=The Search for Nurses Ends in Manila|website=americancity.org|accessdate=May 7, 2010|url=http://americancity.org/magazine/article/the-search-for-nurses-ends-in-manila-ching}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former health secretary, Dr. Galvez Tan, in reference to the doctors and nurses working for an American green card said, "There has to be give and take, not just take, take, take by the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dugger|first= Celia W|title=U.S. Plan to Lure Nurses May Hurt Poor Nations|newspaper= New York Times |date=24 May 2006 |accessdate=May 6, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/world/americas/24nurses.html?pagewanted=print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortage by country==

=== Morocco ===
Morocco has far fewer nurses and other paramedical staff per capita than other countries of comparable national income. The number of nurses in Morocco was 29.025 in 2011, two thirds being registered nurses and one third auxiliary nurses, a ratio of 8 nurses per 10,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SANTE EN CHIFFRE 2012 |url=http://srvweb.sante.gov.ma/Publications/Etudes_enquete/Documents/Sante%20en%20chiffres%202012_Edition%202013.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Health, Morocco |accessdate=1 August 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Morocco has been classified among 57 countries suffering from a glaring shortage of medically trained human resources.

A recent study by the European Institute of Health Sciences (Institut Européen des Sciences de la Santé) in Casablanca based on scientific modeling of future needs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pourquoi choisir une carrière dans la santé? |url=http://iessmaroc.com/pourquoi-une-carriere-en-sante.html/|publisher=Institut Européen des Sciences de la Santé, Maroc |accessdate=1 August 2014 |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the situation will worsen and that to bridge the nursing gap, Morocco needs to produce between 40,000 and 80,000 new nurse graduates until the year 2025.

=== Philippines ===
The Philippines is the largest exporter of nurses in the world supplying 25% of all overseas nurses.&lt;ref name="matsuno"&gt;{{cite web|last=Matsuno|first=Ayaka|title=Nurse Migration: Asian Perspective|website=docstoc.com|date=May 6, 2010|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/17901372/Nurse-Migration_-Asian-Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] study reported that one of every six foreign-born nurses in the OECD countries is from the Philippines.&lt;ref name="carlos"&gt;Carlos, Maria R., and Chizuko Sato. "Sending Society's Responses to International Migration of Nurses and Its Policy Implications: The Case of the Philippines." Ritsumeikan International Affairs 6 (2008): 27-51. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Of all employed Filipino RNs, roughly 85% are working overseas.&lt;ref name="nursemigration"&gt;Perrin, M. E., A. Hagopian, A. Sales, and B. Huang. "Nurse Migration and Its Implications for Philippine Hospitals." International Council of Nurses (2007): 219-26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partially in response to the inability of Filipino nurses to enter their domestic workforce due to a lack of jobs and instead become heavily dependent upon international job markets for nurses. The United States has an especially prominent representation of Filipino nurses. Of the 100,000 foreign nurses working in the U.S. as of 2000, 32.6% were from the Philippines.&lt;ref name="nursemigration" /&gt;

====Reasons for international migration====
The international [[Human migration|migration]] of Filipino nurses takes place in response to "push and pull" factors. The push factors are rooted in the economic conditions in the Philippines in which there is an overabundance of RNs and a lack of open employment positions. The unemployment rate in the Philippines exceeds 10%.&lt;ref name="curranberger1" /&gt; Additionally, health care budgets set up Filipino nurses for low wages and poor benefit packages. There are fewer jobs available, thereby increasing the workload and pressure on RNs. Filipinos often pursue international employment to avoid the economic instability and poor labor conditions in their native country. The government also highly encourages the exportation of RNs internationally. Filipino nurses are pulled to work abroad for the economic benefits of international positions. While a nurse in the Philippines will earn between $180 and $200 U.S. dollars per month, a nurse in the U.S. receives a salary of $4,000 per month.&lt;ref name="film" /&gt; Nurses abroad are greatly respected in the Philippines as they are able to support an entire family at home through remittances. In 1993, Filipinos abroad sent $800 million to their families in the Philippines thereby supporting the economy.&lt;ref name="pushandpull" /&gt; Additionally, remittances from Filipinos made up 5.2% of the Filipino GDP (gross national product) between 1990 and 2000.&lt;ref name="nursemigration" /&gt; Further pull factors stem from the additional economic benefits of signing bonuses in the U.S. To attract more foreign nurses, U.S. hospitals increased signing bonuses from $1,000 to $7,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filipino Nurses Becoming More in Demand in Rich Countries|website=Nurse Immigration USA|date=May 5, 2010|url=http://www.nurseimmigrationusa.com/Downloads/CoreFiles/Filipino_nurses_becoming_more_in_demand.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positions abroad in the health sector are also enticing for their immigration benefits. Throughout the past 50 years of nurse migration, the U.S. has made efforts to ease the visa application process to further encourage international nurses to relieve the nursing shortage. Scholars note that the better living and working conditions, higher income, and opportunities for career advancement draw nurses from the Philippines to work in the U.S.

As the relation between the U.S. and the Philippines stretches back 50 years, Filipino nursing institutions often reflect the same education standards and methods as the U.S. curriculum. Furthermore, a knowledge of English in the Philippines makes it easier for Filipino nurses (rather than nurses from other developing nations) to work in the U.S.

Since 1916, 2,000 nurses have arrived each year in the U.S.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Petrun|first= Erin|title=Unhealthy Exodus Of Filipino Nurses|newspaper= Breaking News Headlines: Business, Entertainment &amp; World News - CBS News|date=January 12, 2007|accessdate=April 29, 2010|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/11/uttm/main2354701.shtml?tag=currentVideoInfo;videoMetaInfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the U.S. approved 50,000 migrant visas for these nurses.&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt; Today, on average, there are about 30,000 Filipino nurses traveling to the U.S. each year.

====Effects of migration====
The transnational migration of Filipino RNs has profound effects on the economy and workforce dynamics in both sending and receiving nations. The departure of nurses from the domestic workforce represents a loss of skilled personnel and the economic investment in education. In addition, the "scarce and relatively expensive-to-train resources" invested are lost when a worker chooses to work abroad.&lt;ref name="pushandpull" /&gt; When RNs migrate internationally, the country they emigrate from loses a valuable resource and any financial or educational support that was invested in the individual.

According to many Filipinos working in hospitals, the most educated and skilled nurses are the first to go abroad. There is disagreement among scholars on the extent to which the Filipino health sector is burdened by its nursing shortage. While the numerical data are inconsistent about whether the nurse supply is in excess or a shortage, it is clear that there is a short supply of the most skilled nurses who go abroad. As a result, operating rooms are often staffed by novice nurses, and nurses with more experience work extremely long hours. As skilled nurses decline in the urban areas, nurses from rural areas migrate to hospitals in the cities for better pay. As a result, rural communities experience a drain of health resources. Stories and studies alike demonstrate that a treatable emergency in the provinces may be fatal because there are no medical professionals to help treat them. In fact, "the number of Filipinos dying without medical attention has been steadily increasing for the last decade."&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2007/12/philippines_hav.html|title=FRONTLINE/WORLD . Rough Cut . Philippines: Have Degree, Will Travel - PBS|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of attention from medical professionals has increased despite advances in technology and medicine and the increasing number of trained nurses in the Philippines.

Doctors, too, have changed professions and joined the international mobility trend. Filipino doctors have begun leaving their professions to train as nurses under the title MD-RN with the hope of immigrating to the U.S. or other developed nations more easily. Since 2000, 3,500 Filipino doctors have migrated abroad as nurses.&lt;ref name="matsuno" /&gt; The U.S. incentives for nurse migration encourage doctors to train as nurses in the hopes of increasing their economic prospects. As a result, the Philippines have a lower average of doctors and nurses with 0.58 and 1.69 respectively for a population of 1,000. The average statistics globally in contrast are 1.23 and 2.56.&lt;ref name="carlos" /&gt; Between 2002 and 2007, 1,000 Filipino hospitals closed due to a shortage of health workers. A study conducted by the former Philippine Secretary of Health, Jaime Galvez-Tan, concluded that close to 80% of government doctors have become nurses or are studying nursing.&lt;ref name="film" /&gt; Of the 9,000 doctors-turned-nurses, 5,000 are working overseas.&lt;ref name="film" /&gt; The extraordinary influence of this international migration has had devastating effects on the health of Filipinos. The number of deaths that were not prevented with medical attention have increased as hospitals are shut down and rural areas are deprived of any medical treatment.

Due to the high interest in international mobility, there is little permanency in the nursing positions in the Philippines. Most RNs choose to sign short-term contracts that will allow for more flexibility to work overseas. Filipino nurses feel less committed to the hospitals as they are temporary staff members. This lack of attachment and minimal responsibility worsens the health of Filipino patients.

The education system has also been hurt by the increase of nurses in the Philippines. As Filipinos are attracted to working as nurses, the number of nursing students has steadily increased. As a result, the number of nursing programs has grown quickly in a commercialized manner. In the 1970s, there were only 40 nursing schools in the Philippines; by 2005 the number had grown to 441 nursing colleges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.docstoc.com/docs/14919026/Brain-Drain-Care-Drain-and-Other-Issues-in-Health/&lt;/ref&gt; While the education opportunities for nursing students has grown tremendously, the quality of education has declined. This can be seen by the low rate (50%) of students who pass the nursing exam since the 1990s. Furthermore, the Technical Committee on Nursing Education of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) determined that 23% of Filipino nursing schools failed to meet the requirements set by the government.&lt;ref name="matsuno" /&gt;

In summary, the emigration of Filipino nurses has encouraged doctors to switch to nursing, created a shortage of skilled specialized and experienced nurses, affected the education system, and distorted [[health care]] delivery and attention to medical issues in rural areas. While remittances, return migration, and the transfer of knowledge support the Philippines, they fail to fully compensate the loss of [[health workforce|health workers]], which disrupts the Filipino health and education sectors.

Dr. Jaime-Galvez Tan, the former Philippine Secretary of Health, warns that if the U.S. passes legislation allowing for freer immigration of nurses the health service of the Philippines could collapse.&lt;ref name="film" /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In October 2015 The UK Government announced that Nurses will be added to the government’s shortage occupation list on an interim basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Restrictions on nurse recruitment from overseas changed - News stories - GOV.UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/restrictions-on-nurse-recruitment-from-overseas-changed|website = www.gov.uk|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, 207 out of 232 English hospitals (90%) reported nursing shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Nurse shortage hits dangerous levels in 90% of hospitals, report finds|url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/21/nurse-shortage-dangerous-90-of-hospitals|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2015-12-21|access-date = 2016-02-03|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016 the [[Royal College of Nursing|RCN]] stated that more than 10,000 nursing posts went unfilled in 2015.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|title = More than 10,000 nursing posts unfilled in London|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35242993|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represented a 3% increase year on year from 11% in 2013, 14% in 2014 and 17% in 2015 of all London nursing positions and 10% as an average nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Warning over ‘critical shortage’ of nurses as vacancies rise to 10,000|url = https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/warning-over-critical-shortage-of-nurses-as-vacancies-rise-to-10000-a3150916.html|website = Evening Standard|access-date = 2016-02-03|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a BBC article the Department of Health said it did not recognise the figures.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

===United States===
According to the American [[National Council of State Boards of Nursing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsbn.org/1237.htm|title=NCLEX Examination Pass Rates|website= National Council of State Boards of Nursing, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of U.S. trained nurses has been increasing over the past decade: In 2000, 71,475 U.S.-trained nurses became newly licensed. In 2005, 99,187 U.S.-trained nurses became newly licensed. In 2009, 134,708 U.S.-trained nurses became newly licensed. Therefore, a 9.8% annual increase of newly licensed U.S. nurses has been observed each year over nine years. It is clear that, nursing enrollment in the U.S. has significantly increased over the past decade relative to the 1.19% annual U.S. population growth.

While the number of U.S. trained licensed nurses has increased each year, the projected nursing demand growth rate from 2008 to 2018, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos083.htm|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition: Registered Nurses}}&lt;/ref&gt; is anticipated to be 22%, or 2.12% annually. Therefore, the 9.8% annual growth of new RN's exceeds the current new position growth rate by a net of 7.7% per year with the assumption of consistent growth figures over the next decade.

The [[United States]] population is projected to grow at least 18% over two decades in the 21st century, while the [[population]] of those 65 and older is expected to increase three times that rate.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt; The increase in the number of elderly is projected to lead to an increase demand for nurses in senior care facilities as well as the need to fill the positions of nurses as they reach retirement age. Projections suggest that by 2020 to 2025 one third of the current RN and LPN workforce will be eligible to retire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of Nursing|url=http://nursing.norwich.edu/the-future-of-nursing/|website=Norwich University|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current shortfall of [[nurses]] is projected at 800,000 by the year 2020.&lt;ref name="brushsochalskiberger2004"/&gt;

Professional health and related occupations were expected to rapidly increase between 2000 and 2012. The demand for health care practitioners and technical occupations will continue to increase. It is projected that there will be 1.7 million job openings between 2000 and 2012. The demand for registered nurses is even higher. Registered nurses are predicted to have 1,101,000 openings due to growth during this 10-year period.&lt;ref name="hecker2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hecker|first= D.E. |year=2004|title=Occupational Employment Projections to 2012.

Other research findings report a projection of opposite trend. Although the demand for nurses continues to increase, the rate of employment has slowed down since 1994 because [[hospitals]] were incorporating more less-skilled nursing personnel to substitute for [[nurses]].&lt;ref name="buerhausstaiger1999"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buerhaus|first1= P. I.|last2=Staiger|first2= D. O. |year=1999|title= Trouble in the nursing labor market?

[[Wage]] among [[nurses]] leveled off in correlation with inflation between 1990 and 1994.&lt;ref name="buerhausstaiger1999"/&gt; The recent economic crisis of 2009 has further decreased the demand for RNs.

Comparing the data released by the Bureau of Health Professions, the projections of shortage within two years have increased.

However, emergency and acute care nurses are in great demand, and this temporary reduction of the shortage is not expected to last as the economy improves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?hint=3&amp;DR_ID=57902|title=Economic Recession Has Temporarily Alleviated Nationwide Nursing Shortage|website= kaisernetwork.org|date= April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halsey|first= Ashley|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/04/AR2009040402871.html|title=Jobs Scarce, Even for Nurses: Economic Crisis Freezes Field Once Short of Workers|newspaper= Washington Post|date=April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was reported that in places like [[Des Moines, Iowa]] newly graduated nurses were having more difficulty finding jobs and older nurses were delaying retirement due to economic conditions.

Some states have a surplus of nurses while other states face a shortage. This is due to factors such as the number of new graduates and the total demand for nurses in each area. Some states face a severe shortage (such as the northwestern states, as well as Texas and Oklahoma), while other states have a surplus of registered nurses.

====Patching up the shortage====
Nursing shortages can be consistent or intermittent depending on the number of [[patients]] needing [[medical]] attention.

Retention and [[recruitment]] are important methods to achieve a long-term solution to the nursing shortage. Recruitment is promoted through making nursing attractive as a profession, especially to younger workers, to counteract the high average age of RNs and future waves of retirement. Refining the work environment can improve the overall perception of nursing as an occupation. This can be achieved by ensuring job satisfaction. Writers Lori Candela, Antonio Gutierrez, and Sarah Keating point out in the journal, ''Nurse Education Today'', ways the academic nursing administrators can make a change. "Individual support to attend workshops or conferences, participation in on-campus teaching/learning faculty sessions, the use of consultants with expertise in particular areas around teaching and evaluation, and mentoring networks that include senior faculty with teaching expertise" can all create a strong relationship between staff members therefore developing a better environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Candela|first=Lori|author2=Antonio Gutierrez |author3=Sarah Keating |title=A National Survey Examining the Professional Work Life of Today's Nursing Faculty|journal=Nurse Education Today|date=August 2013|volume=33|issue=8|pages=853–859|doi=10.1016/j.nedt.2012.10.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691712003528|accessdate=27 October 2013|pmid=23146717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, financial opportunities such as signing bonuses can attract nurses.

To assist the health sector, Congress approved the Nurse Reinvestment Act in 2002 to provide funding to advance nursing education, [[scholarships]], grants, [[Diversity (business)|diversity programs]], loan repayment programs, nursing faculty programs, and comprehensive [[geriatric]] education.&lt;ref name="beu2004"&gt;Beu, B. (2004). and the nurse reinvestment act. [Online]. AORN Journal, 79(5), 1061-1063.

Other ways of assisting to fill the shortage in the United States would include giving nurses the opportunity to pick their own overtime and schedules. Also, it would be a great incentive to young nurses to enter a hospital if they knew there were bonuses for continued excellence.&lt;ref&gt;''Healthcare Financial Management'', 2005, volume 59, issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;

To respond to fluctuating needs in the short term, health care industries have used float pool nurses and agency nurses. Float pool nurses are staff employed by the [[hospital]] to work in any unit. Agency nurses are employed by an independent staffing organization and have the opportunity to work in any [[hospitals]] on a daily, weekly or contractual basis. Similar to other [[professionals]], both types of [[nurses]] can only work within their licensed [[scope of practice]], training, and certification.

Float pool nurses and agency nurses, as mentioned by First Consulting group, are used in response to the current shortage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Use of the said services increases the cost of health care, decreases specialty, and decreases the interest in long-term solutions to the [[shortage]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

International [[recruitment]] is often used to fill the nursing gap but gives rise to concern now that the U.S. Homeland Security has stopped the issuance of the H-1C visa, which was deemed specifically for nurses. Because of the Affordable Care Act, which will result in an increased number of insured Americans, it is estimated that there will be an even greater need for nurses in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Amy|title=Backgrounder #2887 on Health Care March 18, 2014 The Impact of the Affordable Care Act on the Health Care Workforce|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/03/the-impact-of-the-affordable-care-act-on-the-health-care-workforce|accessdate=25 September 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. trained nurses are concerned, however, that this recruitment initiative impedes on their ability to obtain positions in the field after completing their training.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A nursing shortage does not translate to new nursing jobs.

A growing response to the nursing shortage is the advent of [[travel nursing]] a specialized sub-set of the staffing agency industry that has evolved to serve the needs of hospitals affected. According to the [[Professional Association of Nurse Travelers]], there are an estimated 25,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pantravelers.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=7754&amp;Itemid=33|title=PanTravelers - Total number of active nurse travelers|author=Phil Light|work=pantravelers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; working in the U.S. The number of LVN/LPN nurse travelers is not known.

There is a nursing recruitment initiative and nursing workforce development program for residents of the United States originally from foreign countries, who were professional nurses in their countries but are no longer in that profession in the United States. This initiative helps them get back into the nursing profession, especially getting through credentialing and the nursing board exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://welcomebackinitiative.org/|title=Welcome Back Initiative|work=welcomebackinitiative.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original model was developed in 2001 at San Francisco State University in cooperation with [[City College of San Francisco]] ("The San Francisco Welcome Back Center"). There are centers in many cities, such as Los Angeles, San Diego, and Boston—where it is called a "Boston Welcome Back Center for Internationally Educated Nurses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhcc.mass.edu/inside/18 Boston Welcome Back Center for Internationally Educated Nurses"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a program meant for residents of the United States only.&lt;ref&gt;Fifield, Mary L., {{cite journal|url=http://www.nebhe.org/info/pdf/nejhe/NEJHE_Winter08.pdf|format=PDF|title=World-Class Care: Boston Welcome Back Center Puts Internationally Educated Nurses Back to Work|journal= New England Journal of Higher Education|volume=22 n4 |pages=17–18 Winter 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston Welcome Back Center was opened in October 2005 with a $50,000 seed grant from the Board of Higher Education’s Nursing Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mendelsohn|first= Janet|url=http://www.janetmendelsohn.com/docs/WBCarticle_June_2006_Mag.pdf|format=PDF|title=Welcome Back Program Addresses Critical Nursing Shortage - Bunker Hill Community College magazine|website=janetmendelsohn.com|date= June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation====
In 2004, California became the first state to legally mandate minimum nurse-to-patient staffing ratios in acute care hospitals.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aiken LH, Sloane DM, Cimiotti JP, Clarke SP, Flynn L, Seago JA, Spetz J, Smith HL|title=Implications of the California nurse staffing mandate for other states|journal=Health Serv Res|date=August 2010|volume=45|issue=4|pages=904–21|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2010.01114.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2010.01114.x/full|accessdate=4 September 2017|pmc=2908200|pmid=20403061}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study evaluated the effect on outcomes for nurses and patients by comparing outcomes in California in the subsequent two years with those of New Jersey and Pennsylvania — two similar states without such mandates.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"/&gt; There was substantial compliance with the mandate in California, with over 80% compliance rates reported across several different units of surveyed hospitals; equivalent levels of non-mandated compliance in the comparator states were considerably lower, at 19%, 52%, and 63% compliance in medical/surgical, [[pediatric medicine|pediatric]], and [[intensive care unit]]s (ICUs) in New Jersey and 33%, 66%, and 71% in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"/&gt; After extensive adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, the study revealed statistically significant relationships between the nurse-to-patient ratio and 30-day mortality and [[failure to rescue]] (FTR — that is, failure to prevent a clinically-important deterioration, such as death or permanent disability, from a complication of an underlying illness or of medical care) in all three states.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"/&gt; Across all three states, facilities with nurse-to-patient ratios consistent with those mandated in California were associated with lower rates of nursing [[Occupational burnout|burnout]], and nurses reported consistently better quality of care.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"/&gt;

In September 2007, in the 110th Congress, Senator [[Dick Durbin|Richard Durbin]] of Illinois introduced S.2064: Nurse Training and Retention Act of 2007 on the floor of the Senate. It was a bill to fund comprehensive programs to ensure an adequate supply of nurses. It was referred to committee for study but was never reported on by the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-2064|title=H.R.2064|publisher= [[GovTrack]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, in the 110th Congress, H.R. 5924: Emergency Nursing Supply Relief Act was introduced as a bill to the House of Representatives by [[Robert Wexler]] of Florida. If it had passed, it would have amended the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 and would have given up to 20,000 visas per year to nurses and physical therapists until September 2011. Immediate family members of visa beneficiaries would not be counted against the 20,000 yearly cap. The bill was referred to committees for study in Congress but was never reported on by the committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-5924|title= H.R. 5924|website=govtrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.5924|title=H.R.5924 Emergency Nursing Supply Relief Act (Introduced in House)|website=[[THOMAS]] Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h5924/show|title=H.R.5924: Emergency Nursing Supply Relief Act - U.S. Congress - OpenCongress|work=OpenCongress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2009, legislation was introduced by Representatives [[John Shadegg]] (R-AZ), [[Jeff Flake]] (R-AZ), and [[Ed Pastor]] (D-AZ) in the 111th Congress to the House of Representatives, HR 1001 ("The Nursing Relief Act of 2009": To create a new non-immigrant visa category for registered nurses, and for other purposes) making a new non-immigrant "W" visa category for nurses to be able to work in the United States. This was to relieve the nursing shortage still considered to be a crisis despite the economic problems in the country. The proposed bill was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary but was never reported on by Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1001 The Nursing Relief Act of 2009 (HR1001) tracked in the Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalimmigrationcounsel.com/2009/03/articles/us-immigration/proposed-nonimmigrant-visa-category-for-professional-nurses-would-help-fix-the-shortage-of-qualified-nurses/ |title=Proposed Nonimmigrant Visa Category for Professional Nurses Would Help Fix the Shortage of Qualified Nurses|publisher= globalimmigrationcounsel.com|date= March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.1001.IH|title=Nursing Relief Act of 2009 (Introduced in House) HR 1001 IH|publisher= Library of Congress [[THOMAS]] (contains the full proposed bill)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes more strategies for funding and retention. The act provides funding for advanced education nursing grants, diversity grants, and offers a nurse education loan repayment program. The program repays over half of the student loans if the nursing student signs a contract stating that they will work for two years at a medical facility that has a nursing shortage.&lt;ref name="Nursing Student Loan Forgiveness"&gt;{{cite web|title=College Nursing Scholarships &amp; Grants for Nursing|url=http://www.nursingscholarships.org/nursing-student|work=College Nursing Scholarships &amp; Grants|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Nurse Reinvestment Act of 2002 had many strategies. The law authorized and had provisions that included topics such as loan repayment programs and scholarships, providing more grants to the nursing students, making more public service announcements about nursing and educating the public on what a great profession it is and making nursing school more flexible by creating options for the people who already have a degree but would like to go into nursing.&lt;ref name="The Nurse Reinvestment Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nurse Reinvestment|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2002/rpt/2002-R-0712.htm|work=The Nurse Reinvestment Act|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigration process to U.S.====
Nurses seeking to immigrate to the U.S. can apply as direct hires or through a recruitment agency. For entry to the U.S. a foreign nurse must pass a Visa Screen which includes three parts of the process. First they must pass a creditable review, followed by a test of nursing knowledge called the [[Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools]] examination (CGFNS), and finally a test of English-language proficiency.

Foreign nurses compete amongst themselves, with professionals, and other skilled workers for 140,000 employment-based (EB) visas every year.&lt;ref name="feet"/&gt; Filipino nurses are only allocated 2,800 visas per year, thereby creating a backlog among applicants. For example, in September 2009, 56,896 Filipinos were waiting for EB-3 visa numbers.&lt;ref name="feet"&gt;Pastor, Cristina DC. "Once a Hospital Mainstay, Filipino Immigrant Nurses Face Dwindling Job Opportunities." Feet in 2 Worlds. Center of New York City Affairs, 14 Apr. 2010. Web. 05 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This number contrasts with the 95,000 nurses licensed in 2009, many of whom want to migrate to the U.S. Once a nurse obtains a visa number and is approved for a visa and authorized to work in the U.S., they must pass the National Council Licensure Examination to qualify for U.S. nursing standards.

[[File:Eye-prosthesis-brown.jpg|alt=|thumb|Human ocular prosthesis of brown color]]
[[File:CatWithOcularProsthetic.jpeg|thumb|Cat with an ocular prosthesis.]]An '''ocular prosthesis''', '''artificial eye''' or '''glass eye''' is a type of [[craniofacial prosthesis]] that replaces an absent natural [[human eye|eye]] following an [[enucleation of the eye|enucleation]], [[Evisceration (ophthalmology)|evisceration]], or [[orbital exenteration]]. The [[prosthesis]] fits over an orbital implant and under the [[eyelid]]s.  Though often referred to as a glass eye, the ocular prosthesis roughly takes the shape of a convex shell and is made of medical grade plastic [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]]. A few ocular prostheses today are made of [[cryolite]] glass. A variant of the ocular prosthesis is a very thin hard shell known as a [[sclera]]l shell which can be worn over a damaged or eviscerated eye. Makers of ocular prosthetics are known as [[ocularist]]s. An ocular prosthesis does ''not'' provide vision; this would be a [[visual prosthesis]]. Someone with an ocular prosthesis is totally [[Blindness|blind]] on the affected side and has monocular (one sided) [[Visual perception|vision]].

==History==
[[File:Prothese met klein oog en bril, item 1.jpg|thumb|Prosthetic eye and glasses made for an injured [[World War I]] soldier by pioneering plastic surgeon [[Johannes Esser]]]]
[[File:Making glass eye (LOC) (15601805189).jpg|thumb|"Making glass eye", {{circa|1915–1920}}.]]
The earliest known evidence of the use of ocular prosthesis is that of a woman found in [[Shahr-e Sukhteh|Shahr-I Sokhta]], Iran &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chnpress.com/news/?Section=2&amp;id=6857 3rd Millennium BC Artificial Eyeball Discovered in Burnt City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411144011/http://www.chnpress.com/news/?Section=2&amp;id=6857 |date=2012-04-11 }}, December 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; dating back to 2900–2800 BCE.&lt;ref name="london"&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,253221,00.html  |title=5,000-Year-Old Artificial Eye Found on Iran-Afghan Border |author=London Times |date=February 20, 2007  |publisher=foxnews |accessdate=December 14, 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It has a hemispherical form and a diameter of just over 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (1&amp;nbsp;inch). It consists of very light material, probably bitumen paste. The surface of the artificial eye is covered with a thin layer of gold, engraved with a central circle (representing the iris) and gold lines patterned like sun rays. On both sides of the eye are drilled tiny holes, through which a golden thread could hold the eyeball in place. Since microscopic research has shown that the eye socket showed clear imprints of the golden thread, the eyeball must have been worn during her lifetime. In addition to this, an early Hebrew text references a woman who wore an artificial eye made of gold (Yer. Ned. 41c; comp. Yer. Sanh. 13c). Roman and Egyptian priests are known to have produced artificial eyes as early as the fifth century BCE constructed from painted clay attached to cloth and worn outside the socket.&lt;ref name="ocularist.org"&gt;[http://www.ocularist.org/resources_faqs.asp Frequently asked questions], American Society of Ocularists&lt;/ref&gt;

The first in-socket artificial eyes were made of gold with colored enamel, later evolving into the use of glass (thus the name "glass eye") by the Venetians in the later part of the sixteenth century. These were crude, uncomfortable, and fragile and the production methodology remained known only to Venetians until the end of the 18th century, when Parisians took over as the center for artificial eye-making. But the center shifted again, this time to Germany because of their superior glass blowing techniques. Shortly following the introduction of the art of glass eye-making to the United States, German goods became unavailable because of World War II. As a result, the US instead made artificial eyes from acrylic plastic.&lt;ref name="ocularist.org"/&gt;

Production of modern ocular prosthetics has expanded from simply using glass into many different types of materials. In the United States, most custom ocular prostheses are fabricated using PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate), or acrylic. In some countries, Germany especially, prostheses are still most commonly made from glass.&lt;ref name="ocularist.org"/&gt;

===Limits of realism===

Ocularist surgeons have always worked together to make artificial eyes look more realistic. For decades, all efforts and investments to improve the appearance of artificial eyes have been dampened by the immobility of the pupil. One solution to this problem has been demonstrated recently in a device based on an LCD which simulates the pupil size as a function of the ambient light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | PMID=20847748 | first1=J | first2=J-F | first3=A | first4=A | first5=PR | first6=R | journal=Nature Eye | doi=10.1038/eye.2010.128 | last1=Lapointe | url=http://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v24/n11/full/eye2010128a.html | title=A 'living' prosthetic iris | last2=Durette | last3=Harhira | last4=Shaat | last5=Boulos | last6=Kashyap |date=Sep 2010 | volume=24 | pages=1716–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implant types and chemical construction==

There are many different types of implants, classification ranging from shape (Spherical vs egg (oval) shaped), stock vs custom,&lt;ref name="ocularist.org"/&gt; porous vs nonporous, specific chemical make-up, and the presence of a peg or motility post. The most basic simplification can be to divide implant types into two main groups: non-integrated (non-porous) and integrated (porous).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shome|first1=D|last2=Honavar|first2=SG|last3=Raizada|first3=K|last4=Raizada|first4=D|title=Implant and prosthesis movement after enucleation: a randomized controlled trial|journal=Ophthalmology|volume=117|issue=8|pages=1638–44|year=2010|pmid=20417565|doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2009.12.035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonintegrated implants===
Though there is evidence that ocular implants have been around for thousands of years&lt;ref name="london"/&gt; modern nonintegrated spherical intraconal implants came into existence around 1976 (not just glass eyes&lt;ref name="ocularist.org"/&gt;).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0161-6420(00)00348-1|last1=Colen|first1=TP|last2=Paridaens|first2=DA|last3=Lemij|first3=HG|last4=Mourits|first4=MP|last5=Van Den Bosch|first5=WA|title=Comparison of artificial eye amplitudes with acrylic and hydroxyapatite spherical enucleation implants|journal=Ophthalmology|volume=107|issue=10|pages=1889–94|year=2000|pmid=11013194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonintegrated implants contain no unique apparatus for attachments to the [[extraocular muscles]] and do not allow in-growth of organic tissue into their inorganic substance. Such implants have no direct attachment to the ocular prosthesis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Usually, these implants are covered with a material that permits fixation of the extraocular recti muscles, such as donor [[sclera]] or polyester gauze which improves implant motility, but does not allow for direct mechanical coupling between the implant and the artificial eye.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
Non-integrated implants include the acrylic (PMMA&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;), glass, and silicone spheres.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chuah|first1=CT|last2=Chee|first2=SP|last3=Fong|first3=KS|last4=Por|first4=YM|last5=Choo|first5=CT|last6=Luu|first6=C|last7=Seah|first7=LL|title=Integrated hydroxyapatite implant and non-integrated implants in enucleated Asian patients|journal=Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore|volume=33|issue=4|pages=477–83|year=2004|pmid=15329760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) (acrylic)'''
[[File:Eyes Prosthetics.tif|thumb|Eyes Prosthetics, Polymethyl methacrylate]]
[[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Polymethyl methacrylate]] (PMMA)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; is a transparent thermoplastic available for use as ocular prosthesis, replacement intraocular lenses when the original lens has been removed in the treatment of cataracts and has historically been used as hard contact lenses.

PMMA has a good degree of compatibility with human tissue, much more so than glass. Although various materials have been used to make nonintegrated implants in the past, polymethyl methacrylate is one of the implants of choice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Integrated implants (porous)===

The porous nature of integrated implants allows fibrovascular ingrowth throughout the implant and thus also insertion of pegs or posts.&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Custer|first1=PL|last2=Kennedy|first2=RH|last3=Woog|first3=JJ|last4=Kaltreider|first4=SA|last5=Meyer|first5=DR|title=Orbital implants in enucleation surgery: a report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology|journal=Ophthalmology|volume=110|issue=10|pages=2054–61|year=2003|pmid=14522788|doi=10.1016/S0161-6420(03)00857-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because direct mechanical coupling is thought to improve artificial eye motility, attempts have been made to develop so-called ‘integrated implants’ that are directly connected to the artificial eye.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
Historically, implants that directly attached to the prosthesis were unsuccessful because of chronic inflammation or infection arising from the exposed nonporous implant material.&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt;
This led to the development of quasi-integrated implants with a specially designed anterior surface that allegedly better transferred implant motility to the artificial eye through the closed conjunctiva and Tenon’s capsule.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
In 1985, the problems associated with integrated implants were thought to be largely solved with the introduction of spherical implants made of porous calcium hydroxyapatite. This material allows for fibrovascular ingrowth within several months.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
Porous enucleation implants currently are fabricated from a variety of materials including natural and synthetic [[hydroxyapatite]], [[aluminium oxide]], and [[polyethylene]].

The surgeon can alter the contour of porous implants before insertion, and it is also possible to modify the contour in situ, although this is sometimes difficult.&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt;

'''Hydroxyapatite (HA)'''

Hydroxyapatite implants are spherical and made in a variety of sizes and different materials (Coralline/ Synthetic/ Chinese).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt;

Since their introduction in 1989 when an implant made from hydroxyapatite received Food and Drug Administration approval, spherical hydroxyapatite implants have gained widespread popularity as an enucleation implant&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt; and was at one point was the most commonly used orbital implant in the United States.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadiq|first1=SA|last2=Mengher|first2=LS|last3=Lowry|first3=J|last4=Downes|first4=R|title=Integrated orbital implants – a comparison of hydroxyapatite and porous polyethylene implants|journal=Orbit (Amsterdam, Netherlands)|volume=27|issue=1|pages=37–40|year=2008|pmid=18307145|doi=10.1080/01676830701512585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hornblass|first1=A|last2=Biesman|first2=BS|last3=Eviatar|first3=JA|title=Current techniques of enucleation: a survey of 5,439 intraorbital implants and a review of the literature|journal=Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery|volume=11|issue=2|pages=77–86; discussion 87–88|year=1995|pmid=7654621|doi=10.1097/00002341-199506000-00001|last4=Nunery|first4=William R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The porous nature of this material allows fibrovascular ingrowth throughout the implant and permits insertion of a coupling device (PEG) with reduced risk of inflammation or infection associated with earlier types of exposed integrated implants.&lt;ref name="Custer, P.

hydroxyapatite is limited to preformed (stock&lt;ref name="ocularist.org"/&gt;) spheres (for enucleation) or granules (for building up defects).&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Duffy, M., Biesman, B.|title=Porous polyethylene expands orbitofacial options|journal=Ophthalmology Times|year= 2000|volume=25|issue=7|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One main disadvantage of HA is that it needs to be covered with exogenous material, such as sclera, [[polyethylene terephthalate]], or [[vicryl]] mesh (which has the disadvantage of creating a rough implant tissue interface that can lead to technical difficulties in implantation and subsequent erosion of overlying tissue with the end stage being extrusion), as direct suturing is not possible for muscle attachment. Scleral covering carries with it the risk of transmission of infection, inflammation, and rejection.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

A recent study has shown that HA has a more rapid rate of fibrovascularization than
Medpor.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

'''Porous polyethylene (PP)'''

MEDPOR is a high-density porous polyethylene (Medpor) &lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt;
Implant manufactured from linear high-density polyethylene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porexsurgical.com/english/surgical/smedpor.asp OPTIONS: MEDPOR Biomaterial and Surgical Implants]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=YH|last2=Cui|first2=HG|title=High density porous polyethylene material (Medpor) as an unwrapped orbital implant|journal=Journal of Zhejiang University. Science. B|volume=7|issue=8|pages=679–82|year=2006|pmid=16845724|pmc=1533749|doi=10.1631/jzus.2006.B0679}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Development in polymer chemistry has allowed introduction of newer biocompatible material such as porous polyethylene (PP) to be introduced into the field of orbital implant surgery.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Porous polyethylene enucleation implants have been used since at least 1989.&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt; It is available in dozens of prefabricated spherical and non-spherical shapes and in different sizes or plain blocks for individualized intraoperative customizing.&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt;
The material is firm but malleable and allows direct suturing of muscles to implant without wrapping or extra steps. Additionally, the smooth surface is less abrasive and irritating than other materials used for similar purposes.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; Polyethylene also becomes vascularized, allowing placement of a titanium motility post that joins the implant to the prosthesis in the same way that the peg is used for hydroxyapatite implants.&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt;

PP has been shown to have a good outcome, and in 2004, it was the most commonly used orbital implant in the United States.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/01.IOP.0000129528.16938.1E|last1=Su|first1=GW|last2=Yen|first2=MT|title=Current trends in managing the anophthalmic socket after primary enucleation and evisceration|journal=Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery|volume=20|issue=4|pages=274–80|year=2004|pmid=15266140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porous polyethylene fulfills several criteria for a successful implant, including little propensity to migrate and restoration of defect in an anatomic fashion; it is readily available, cost-effective, and can be easily modified or custom-fit for each defect.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; The PP implant does not require to be covered and therefore avoids some of the problems associated with hydroxyapatite implants.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

'''Bioceramic'''

Bioceramic prosthetics are made of aluminium oxide (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Aluminium oxide is a ceramic biomaterial that has been used for more than 35 years in the orthopedic and dental fields for a variety of prosthetic applications because of its low friction, durability, stability, and inertness.&lt;ref name="r3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=DR|last2=Klapper|first2=SR|last3=Gilberg|first3=SM|last4=Dutton|first4=JJ|last5=Wong|first5=A|last6=Mawn|first6=L|title=The bioceramic implant: evaluation of implant exposures in 419 implants|journal=Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery|volume=26|issue=2|pages=80–82|year=2010|pmid=20305504|doi=10.1097/IOP.0b013e3181b80c30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aluminium oxide ocular implants can be obtained in spherical and non-spherical (egg-shaped) shapes and in different sizes &lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt; for use in the anophthalmic socket. It received US Food and Drug Administration approval in April 2000 and was approved by Health and Welfare, Canada, in February 2001.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;

Aluminium oxide has previously been shown to be more biocompatible than HA in cell culture studies and has been suggested as the standard reference material when biocompatibility studies are required to investigate new products. The rate of exposure previously associated with the bioceramic implant (2%) was less than most reports on the HA or porous polyethylene implant (0% to 50%).&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;

'''Conical orbital implant (COI) and multipurpose conical orbital implant (MCOI) '''

The safe and effective sphere (still popular and easy to use) was supplemented with the pyramid or COI implant.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; The COI has unique design elements that have been incorporated into an overall conical shape, including a flat anterior surface, superior projection and preformed channels for the rectus muscles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porexsurgical.com/english/surgical/sprodcoiimplants.asp Conical Orbital Implant (COI)]&lt;/ref&gt; 5-0 Vicryl suture needles can be passed with slight difficulty straight through the implant to be tied on the anterior surface. In addition, this implant features a slightly recessed slot for the superior rectus and a protrusion to fill the superior fornix.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

The newest model is the multipurpose conical orbital implant, which was designed to address the issues of the postoperative anophthalmic orbit being at risk for the development of socket abnormalities including enophthalmos, retraction of the upper eyelid, deepening of the superior sulcus, backward tilt of the prothesis, and stretching of the lower eyelid.1 after evisceration or enucleation, These problems are generally thought to be secondary to orbital volume deficiencies which is also addressed by MCOIs.
The conical shape of the multipurpose conical porous polyethylene orbital implant (MCOI) (Porex Medical) more closely matches the anatomic shape of the orbit than a spherical implant. The wider anterior portion, combined with the narrower and longer posterior portion, allows for a more complete and natural replacement of the lost orbital volume. This shape reduces the risk of superior sulcus deformity and puts more volume within the muscle cone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/01.iop.0000173191.24824.40|last1=Marshak|first1=H|last2=Dresner|first2=SC|title=Multipurpose conical orbital implant in evisceration|journal=Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery|volume=21|issue=5|pages=376–78|year=2005|pmid=16234704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kostick|first1=DA|last2=Linberg|first2=JV|title=Evisceration with hydroxyapatite implant. Surgical technique and review of 31 case reports|journal=Ophthalmology|volume=102|issue=10|pages=1542–48; discussion 1548–49|year=1995|pmid=9097804|doi=10.1016/s0161-6420(95)30833-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Muscles can be placed at any location the surgeon desires with these implants. This is advantageous for cases of damaged or lost muscles after trauma, and the remaining muscles are transposed to improve postoperative motility. And in anticipation of future peg placement there is a 6&amp;nbsp;mm diameter flattened surface, which eliminates the need to shave a flat anterior surface prior to peg placement.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

Both implants (COI and MCOI) are composed of interconnecting channels that allow ingrowth of host connective tissue. Complete implant vascularization reduces the risk of infection, extrusion, and other complications associated with nonintegrated implants. And both implants produce superior motility and postoperative cosmesis.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

'''Pegged (motility post) implants'''

In hydroxyapatite implants a secondary procedure can insert an externalized, round-headed peg or screw into the implant. The prosthesis is modified to accommodate the peg, creating a ball-and-socket joint:&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt; after fibrovascular ingrowth is completed, a small hole can be drilled into the anterior surface of the implant. After conjunctivalization of this hole, it can be fitted with a peg with a rounded top that fits into a corresponding dimple at the posterior surface of the artificial eye. This peg thus directly transfers implant motility to the artificial eye.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
However, the motility peg is mounted in only a minority of patients. This may partially be the result of problems associated with peg placement, whereas hydroxyapatite implants are assumed to yield superior artificial eye motility even without the peg.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Polyethylene also becomes vascularized, allowing placement of a titanium motility post that joins the implant to the prosthesis in the same way that the peg is used for hydroxyapatite implants.&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt;

==Implant movement==

Implant and prosthesis movement are important aspects of the overall cosmetic appearance after enucleation and are essential to the ideal objective of crafting a lifelike eye similar in all aspects to the normal fellow eye.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Byron C. Smith|author2=Frank A. Nesi |author3=Mark R. Levine |author4=Richard D. Lisman | title = Smith's Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery| year = 1998| publisher = Mosby Incorporated| isbn = 978-0-8151-6356-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are several theories of improved eye movement, such as using integrating prosthetic material, pegging the implant, covering the implant (e.g. with scleral tissue), or suturing the eye muscles directly to the prosthetic implant.
The efficiency of transmitting movement from the implant to the prosthesis determines the degree of prosthetic motility. Movement is transmitted from traditional nonporous spherical implants through the surface tension at the conjunctival–prosthetic interface and movement of the fornices. Quasi-integrated implants have irregularly shaped surfaces that create an indirect coupling mechanism between the implant and prosthesis that imparts greater movement to the prosthesis. Directly integrating the implant to the prosthesis through an externalized coupling mechanism would be expected to improve motility further.&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt;

Despite the reasoning stating that hydroxyapatite orbital implants without a motility peg would yield a superior artificial eye motility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shields|first1=CL|last2=Shields|first2=JA|last3=De Potter|first3=P|title=Hydroxyapatite orbital implant after enucleation. Experience with initial 100 consecutive cases|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology|volume=110|issue=3|pages=333–38|year=1992|pmid=1311918|doi=10.1001/archopht.1992.01080150031022}}&lt;/ref&gt; when similar surgical techniques are used unpegged porous (hydroxyapatite) enucleation implants and donor sclera-covered nonporous (acrylic) spherical enucleation implants yield comparable artificial eye motility.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt; In two studies&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Custer|first1=PL|last2=Trinkaus|first2=KM|last3=Fornoff|first3=J|title=Comparative motility of hydroxyapatite and alloplastic enucleation implants|journal=Ophthalmology|volume=106|issue=3|pages=513–16|year=1999|pmid=10080207|doi=10.1016/S0161-6420(99)90109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were no differences in maximum amplitude between hydroxyapatite and acrylic or silicone spherical enucleation implants,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; thus indicating that the implant material itself may not have a bearing on implant movement as long as the muscles are attached directly or indirectly to the implant and the implant is not pegged.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
The motility of a nonintegrated artificial eye may be caused by at least two forces. (1) The rubbing force between the posterior surface of the artificial eye and the conjunctiva that covers the implant may cause the artificial eye to move. Because this force is likely to be approximately equal in all directions, it would cause comparable horizontal and vertical artificial eye amplitudes. (2) An artificial eye usually fits snugly in the conjunctival space (possibly not in the superior fornix). Therefore, any movement of the conjunctival fornices will cause a similar movement of the artificial eye, whereas lack of movement of the fornices will restrict its motility.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
Imbrication of the rectus muscles over a nonintegrated implant traditionally was thought to impart movement to the implant and prosthesis. Like a ball-and-socket joint, when the implant moves, the prosthesis moves. However, because the so-called ball and socket are separated by layers of Tenon’s capsule, imbricated muscles, and conjunctiva, the mechanical efficiency of transmission of movement from the implant to the prosthesis is suboptimal. Moreover, the concern is that imbrication of the recti over nonintegrated implants actually can result in implant migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00002341-199506000-00002|last1=Beard|first1=C|title=Remarks on historical and newer approaches to orbital implants|journal=Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery|volume=11|issue=2|pages=89–90|year=1995|pmid=7654622}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent myoconjuctival technique of enucleation is an alternative to muscle imbrication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=r4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yadava U, Sachdeva P, Arora A |title=Myoconjunctival enucleation for enhanced implant movement: result of a randomised prospective study|journal=Indian J Ophthalmol |year=2004|volume=52|issue=3|pages=221–26|pmid=15510462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is generally accepted that integrating the prosthesis to a porous implant with peg insertion enhances prosthetic movement, there is little available evidence in the literature that documents the degree of improvement.&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt;
And although the porous implants have been reported to offer improved implant movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=DR|last2=Chan|first2=S|last3=Mawn|first3=L|last4=Gilberg|first4=S|last5=Dean|first5=T|last6=Brownstein|first6=S|last7=Hill|first7=VE|title=Complications associated with pegging hydroxyapatite orbital implants|journal=Ophthalmology|volume=106|issue=3|pages=505–12|year=1999|pmid=10080206|doi=10.1016/S0161-6420(99)90108-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; these clearly are more expensive and intrusive, requiring wrapping, and subsequent imaging to determine vascularization and pegging to provide for better transmission of implant movement to the prosthesis, and also are prone to implant exposure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Age and size of the implant may also affect the motility, since in a study comparing patients with hydroxyapatite implants and patients with nonporous implants, the implant movement appeared to decrease with age in both groups. This study also demonstrated improved movement of larger implants irrespective of material.&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt;

==Surgical procedure==

Essentially the surgery follows these steps:&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt;
* Anesthesia
* Conjunctival peritomy
* Separation of the anterior [[Tenon's capsule|Tenon’s fascia]] from the sclera
* Pass sutures through rectus muscles
* Rectus muscles disinserted from the globe
* Rotate and elevate the globe
* Open Tenon’s capsule to visualize optic nerve
* Cauterize necessary blood vessels
* Divide the nerve
* Remove the eye
* Hemostasis is achieved with either cautery or digital pressure.
* Insert orbital implant.
* If necessary (hydroxyapatite) cover the implant with wrapping material before
* Attach the muscle (if possible) either directly (PP) or indirectly (HA) to implant.
* Create fenestrations in wrapping material if necessary
* For HA implants drill 1&amp;nbsp;mm holes as muscle insertion site
* Draw Tenon’s fascia over implant
* Close Tenon’s facia in one or two layers
* Suture conjunctiva
* Insert temporary ocular conformer until prosthesis is received (4–8 weeks later)
* After implant vascularization an optional secondary procedure can be done to place a couple peg or post.

Also under anesthesia
* Create conjunctival incision at the peg insertion site
* Create hole into implant to insert peg or post
* Modify prosthesis to receive peg/post.

The surgery is done under general anesthesia with the addition of extra subconjunctival and/or retrobulbar anesthetics injected locally in some cases.
The following is a description of the surgical procedure performed by Custer ''et al.'':&lt;ref name="Custer, P. L. 2003"/&gt;

The conjunctival peritomy is performed at the corneal limbus, preserving as much healthy tissue as possible. Anterior Tenon’s fascia is separated from the sclera. Blunt dissection in the four quadrants between the rectus muscles separates deep Tenon’s fascia.

Sutures may be passed through the rectus muscles before their disinsertion from the globe. Some surgeons also suture one or both oblique muscles. Traction sutures or clamps may be applied to the horizontal rectus muscle insertions to assist in rotating and elevating the globe during the ensuing dissection. Tenon’s capsule may be opened posteriorly to allow visualization of the optic nerve. The vortex veins and posterior ciliary vessels may be cauterized before dividing the nerve and removing the eye. Alternatively, the optic nerve may be localized with a clamp before transection. Hemostasis is achieved with either cautery or digital pressure.

The orbital implant is inserted at the time of enucleation. An appropriately sized implant should replace the volume of the globe and leave sufficient room for the ocular prosthesis. Enucleation implants are available in a variety of sizes that may be determined by using sizing implants or calculated by measuring globe volume or axial length of the contralateral eye.

In the past, spherical nonporous implants were placed in the intraconal space and the extraocular muscles were either left unattached or were tied over the implant. Wrapping these implants allows attachment of the muscles to the covering material, a technique that seems to improve implant movement and reduce the incidence of implant migration. Porous implants may be saturated with antibiotic solution before insertion. Because the brittle nature of hydroxyapatite prevents direct suturing of the muscles to the implant, these implants are usually covered with some form of wrapping material. The muscles are attached to the implant in a technique similar to that used for spherical non-porous implants. The muscles may be directly sutured to porous polyethylene implants either by passing the suture through the implant material or by using an implant with fabricated suture tunnels. Some surgeons also wrap porous polyethylene implants either to facilitate muscle attachment or to reduce the risk of implant exposure. A variety of wrapping materials have been used to cover porous implants, including polyglactin or polyglycolic acid mesh, heterologous tissue (bovine pericardium), homologous donor tissue (sclera, dermis), and autogenous tissue (fascia lata, temporalis fascia, posterior auricular muscle, rectus abdominis sheath).
Fenestrations in the wrapping material are created at the insertion sites of the extraocular muscles, allowing the attached muscles to be in contact with the implant and improving implant vascularization. Drilling 1&amp;nbsp;mm holes into the implant at the muscle insertion sites is performed to facilitate vascularization of hydroxyapatite implants. Tenon’s fascia is drawn over the implant and closed in one or two layers. The conjunctiva is then sutured. A temporary ocular conformer is inserted at the completion of the pro- cedure and is worn until the patient receives a prosthesis 4 to 8 weeks after surgery.
An elective secondary procedure is required to place the coupling peg or post in those patients who desire improved prosthetic motility. That procedure is usually delayed for at least 6 months after enucleation to allow time for implant vascularization. Technetium bone or gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans are not now universally used, but they have been used to confirm vascularization before peg insertion. Under local anesthesia, a conjunctival incision is created at the peg insertion site. A hole is created into the porous implant to allow insertion of the peg or post.
The prosthesis is then modified to receive the peg or post. Some surgeons have preplaced coupling posts in porous polyethylene implants at the time of enucleation. The post may spontaneously expose or is externalized in a later procedure via a conjunctival incision.

== Aftermath of surgical procedures ==
Regardless of the procedure, a type of ocular prosthesis is always needed afterwards.  The surgeon will insert a temporary prosthesis at the end of the surgery, known as a stock eye,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocularist.org/resources_faqs.asp#Whatsthedifference|title=American Society of Ocularists - Frequently Asked Questions|website=www.ocularist.org|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refer the patient to an [[ocularist]], who is not a medical doctor, but board certified ocularist by the American Society of Ocularists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocularist.org/resources_faqs.asp#Whatisanocularist|title=American Society of Ocularists - Frequently Asked Questions|website=www.ocularist.org|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process of making an ocular prosthesis, or a custom eye, will begin, usually six weeks after the surgical procedure, and it typically will take up to three visits before the final fitting of the prosthesis.  In most cases, the patient will be fitted during the first visit, return for the hand-painting of the prosthesis, and finally come back for the final fitting.  The methods used to fit, shape, and paint the prosthesis often vary between ocularist and patient needs.

Living with an ocular prosthesis requires care, but oftentimes patients who have suffered from incurable eye disorders, such as [[Microphthalmia|micropthalmia]], [[Anophthalmia|anophtalmia]] or [[retinoblastoma]], achieve a better quality of life with their prostheses.  The care required for an ocular prosthesis, outside of regular polishes and check-ups with ocularists, typically revolves around maintaining moisture of the prosthesis and cleanliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ocularpro.com/prosthetic-eye-resources/handling-and-care-of-prosthetic-eye/|title=Prosthetic Eye Care |publisher= Ocular Prosthetics, Inc.|website=ocularpro.com|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Osteoporosis''' is a [[disease]] where increased bone weakness increases the risk of a [[bone fracture|broken bone]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; It is the most common reason for a broken bone among [[Old age|the elderly]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite web |title= Handout on Health: Osteoporosis |url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/Osteoporosis/default.asp|access-date=16 May 2015|date=August 2014|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518091922/http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/Osteoporosis/default.asp|archive-date=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bones that commonly break include the [[vertebrae]] in the [[Vertebral column|spine]], the bones of the [[forearm]], and the [[hip]].&lt;ref name=Gol2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Golob AL, Laya MB | title = Osteoporosis: screening, prevention, and management | journal = The Medical Clinics of North America | volume = 99 | issue = 3 | pages = 587–606 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25841602 | doi = 10.1016/j.mcna.2015.01.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; [[Chronic pain]] and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities may occur following a broken bone.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;

Osteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal [[peak bone mass|maximum bone mass]] and greater-than-normal bone loss.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Bone loss increases after [[menopause]] due to lower levels of [[estrogen]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments, including [[alcoholism]], [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]], [[hyperthyroidism]], [[kidney disease]], and [[oophorectomy|surgical removal of the ovaries]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss, including some [[Anticonvulsant|antiseizure medications]], [[chemotherapy]], [[proton pump inhibitor]]s, [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]], and [[glucocorticoid|glucocorticosteroids]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; [[Tobacco smoking|Smoking]] and too little [[exercise]] are also risk factors.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Osteoporosis is defined as a [[bone density]] of 2.5 [[standard deviation]]s below that of a young adult.&lt;ref name="WHOcriteria"/&gt; This is typically measured by [[dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]].&lt;ref name="WHOcriteria"&gt;{{Cite book|author=WHO Scientific Group on the Prevention and Management of Osteoporosis (2000 : Geneva, Switzerland)|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_921.pdf|title=Prevention and management of osteoporosis : report of a WHO scientific group|year=2003|pages=7, 31|isbn=978-9241209212|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716094519/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_921.pdf|archivedate=16 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Blausen 0686 Osteoporosis 01.png|thumb|Illustration depicting normal standing posture and osteoporosis]]
Osteoporosis itself has [[asymptomatic|no symptoms]]; its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures. Osteoporotic [[fractures]] occur in situations where healthy people would not normally break a bone; they are therefore regarded as fragility fractures. Typical fragility fractures occur in the [[vertebral column]], [[rib]], hip and [[wrist]].

===Fractures===
Fractures are a common symptom of osteoporosis and can result in disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|others=Jameson, J. Larry,, Kasper, Dennis L.,, Fauci, Anthony S., 1940-, Hauser, Stephen L.,, Longo, Dan L.

The most common osteoporotic fractures are of the wrist, spine, shoulder and hip. The symptoms of a [[vertebra]]l collapse ("[[compression fracture]]") are sudden [[back pain]], often with [[radicular pain]] (shooting pain due to nerve root compression) and rarely with [[spinal cord compression]] or [[cauda equina syndrome]]. Multiple vertebral fractures lead to a stooped posture, loss of height, and chronic pain with resultant reduction in mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim DH, Vaccaro AR | title = Osteoporotic compression fractures of the spine; current options and considerations for treatment | journal = The Spine Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 479–87 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16934715 | doi = 10.1016/j.spinee.2006.04.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractures of the long bones acutely impair mobility and may require [[surgery]]. [[Hip fracture]], in particular, usually requires prompt surgery, as serious risks are associated with it, such as [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]], and increased mortality.

Fracture risk calculators assess the risk of fracture based upon several criteria, including [[bone mineral density]], age, smoking, alcohol usage, weight, and gender. Recognized calculators include [[FRAX]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://courses.washington.edu/bonephys/FxRiskCalculator.html|title= Fracture Risk Calculator|author= Susan Ott|accessdate= 2009-11-03|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091014090245/http://courses.washington.edu/bonephys/FxRiskCalculator.html|archivedate= 14 October 2009|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dubbo.

The term "established osteoporosis" is used when a [[fragility fracture|broken bone due to osteoporosis]] has occurred.&lt;ref name=WHO1994&gt;{{cite journal | author = WHO | title = Assessment of fracture risk and its application to screening for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Report of a WHO Study Group | journal = World Health Organization Technical Report Series | volume = 843 | pages = 1–129 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7941614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Osteoporosis is a part of [[frailty syndrome]].

===Falls risk===

The increased risk of falling associated with aging leads to fractures of the wrist, spine, and hip. The risk of falling, in turn, is increased by impaired eyesight due to any cause (e.g. [[glaucoma]], [[macular degeneration]]), [[balance disorder]], [[movement disorder]]s (e.g. [[Parkinson's disease]]), [[dementia]], and [[sarcopenia]] (age-related loss of [[skeletal muscle]]). [[Collapse (medical)|Collapse]] (transient loss of postural tone with or without loss of consciousness) leads to a significant risk of falls; causes of syncope are manifold, but may include [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s (irregular heart beat), [[vasovagal syncope]], [[orthostatic hypotension]] (abnormal drop in blood pressure on standing up), and [[seizure]]s. Removal of obstacles and loose carpets in the living environment may substantially reduce falls. Those with previous falls, as well as those with gait or balance disorders, are most at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ganz DA, Bao Y, Shekelle PG, Rubenstein LZ | title = Will my patient fall? | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 1 | pages = 77–86 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17200478 | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.1.77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==

Risk factors for osteoporotic fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and (potentially) modifiable. In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable.
[[Caffeine]] is not a risk factor for osteoporosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waugh EJ, Lam MA, Hawker GA, McGowan J, Papaioannou A, Cheung AM, Hodsman AB, Leslie WD, Siminoski K, Jamal SA | title = Risk factors for low bone mass in healthy 40–60 year old women: a systematic review of the literature | journal = Osteoporosis International : A Journal Established as Result of Cooperation Between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–21 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18523710 | doi = 10.1007/s00198-008-0643-x | pmc = 5110317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is more likely in females than males.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;

===Nonmodifiable===

* The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age (in both men and women) and [[female]] sex; [[estrogen]] deficiency following menopause or [[oophorectomy|surgical removal of the ovaries]] is correlated with a rapid reduction in bone mineral density, while in men, a decrease in [[testosterone]] levels has a comparable (but less pronounced) effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sinnesael M, Claessens F, Boonen S, Vanderschueren D | title = Novel insights in the regulation and mechanism of androgen action on bone | journal = Current Opinion in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Obesity | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 240–44 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23449008 | doi = 10.1097/MED.0b013e32835f7d04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sinnesael M, Boonen S, Claessens F, Gielen E, Vanderschueren D | title = Testosterone and the male skeleton: a dual mode of action | journal = Journal of Osteoporosis | volume = 2011 | pages = 1–7 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21941679 | doi = 10.4061/2011/240328 | pmc=3173882}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Race: While osteoporosis occurs in people from all ethnic groups, [[European ethnic groups|European]] or [[Asian people|Asian]] ancestry predisposes for osteoporosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Melton LJ | title = Epidemiology worldwide | journal = Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages =v, 1–13 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12699289 | doi = 10.1016/S0889-8529(02)00061-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Heredity: Those with a [[family history (medicine)|family history]] of fracture or osteoporosis are at an increased risk; the [[heritability]] of the fracture, as well as low bone mineral density, is relatively high, ranging from 25 to 80%. At least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis.&lt;ref name="Raisz"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Raisz L|title = Pathogenesis of osteoporosis: concepts, conflicts, and prospects|journal = J Clin Invest|volume = 115|issue = 12|pages = 3318–25|year = 2005|pmid = 16322775|url = http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/115/12/3318|doi = 10.1172/JCI27071|pmc = 1297264|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070824074703/http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/115/12/3318|archivedate = 24 August 2007|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Those who have already had a fracture are at least twice as likely to have another fracture compared to someone of the same age and sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ojo F, Al Snih S, Ray LA, Raji MA, Markides KS | title = History of fractures as predictor of subsequent hip and nonhip fractures among older Mexican Americans | journal = Journal of the National Medical Association | volume = 99 | issue = 4 | pages = 412–18 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17444431 | pmc = 2569658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early menopause/hysterectomy is another predisposing factor.
* Build: A small stature is also a nonmodifiable risk factor associated with the development of osteoporosis.&lt;ref name=AppTher&gt;{{cite book |author1=Brian K Alldredge |author2=Koda-Kimble, Mary Anne |author3=Young, Lloyd Y. |author4=Wayne A Kradjan |author5=B.

* In general, [[Muscle immobilization|immobilization]] causes bone loss (following the 'use it or lose it' rule). For example, localized osteoporosis can occur after prolonged immobilization of a fractured limb in a cast. This is also more common in active people with a high bone turn-over (for example, athletes). Other examples include bone loss during [[space flight]] or in people who are bedridden or use wheelchairs for various reasons.
* [[Hypogonadism|Hypogonadal]] states can cause secondary osteoporosis. These include [[Turner syndrome]], [[Klinefelter syndrome]], [[Kallmann syndrome]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[andropause]],&lt;ref name='medscapeosteoporosis'/&gt; [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] amenorrhea or [[hyperprolactinemia]].&lt;ref name='medscapeosteoporosis'/&gt; In females, the effect of hypogonadism is mediated by estrogen deficiency. It can appear as early menopause (&lt;45 years) or from prolonged premenopausal amenorrhea (&gt;1 year). Bilateral [[oophorectomy]] (surgical removal of the ovaries) and [[premature ovarian failure]] cause deficient estrogen production. In males, testosterone deficiency is the cause (for example, andropause or after surgical removal of the [[testes]]).
* Endocrine disorders that can induce bone loss include [[Cushing's syndrome]],&lt;ref name="WHOcriteria"/&gt; [[hyperparathyroidism]],&lt;ref name="WHOcriteria"/&gt; [[hyperthyroidism]],&lt;ref name="WHOcriteria"/&gt; [[hypothyroidism]], [[diabetes mellitus]] type 1 and 2,&lt;ref name=OsteoporosisMen&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ebeling PR | title = Clinical practice.

===Medication===
Certain medications have been associated with an increase in osteoporosis risk; only glucocorticosteroids and anticonvulsants are classically associated, but evidence is emerging with regard to other drugs.

==Pathogenesis==
[[File:Osteoporosis Locations.png|thumb|Osteoporosis locations]]
The underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between [[bone resorption]] and [[Bone development|bone formation]]. In normal bone, [[matrix (biology)|matrix]] remodeling of bone is constant; up to 10% of all bone mass may be undergoing remodeling at any point in time. The process takes place in bone multicellular units (BMUs) as first described by Frost &amp; Thomas in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Frost HM, Thomas CC. Bone Remodeling Dynamics. Springfield, IL: 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osteoclasts]] are assisted by transcription factor PU.1 to degrade the bone matrix, while [[osteoblasts]] rebuild the bone matrix. Low bone mass density can then occur when osteoclasts are degrading the bone matrix faster than the osteoblasts are rebuilding the bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://genomemedicine.com/content/5/5/44|title = Genome-wide approaches for identifying genetic risk factors for osteoporosis|last = Wu|first = Shuyan|date = 2013|journal = Genome Med|doi = 10.1186/gm448|pmid = 23731620|pmc = 3706967|access-date = |volume = 5|issue = 5|pages = 44|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150427124813/http://genomemedicine.com/content/5/5/44|archivedate = 27 April 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling, likely due to MSC biasing away from the [[osteoblast]] and toward the [[Marrow Adipose Tissue|marrow adipocyte]] lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paccou J, Hardouin P, Cotten A, Penel G, Cortet B | title = The Role of Bone Marrow Fat in Skeletal Health: Usefulness and Perspectives for Clinicians | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 100 | issue = 10 | pages = 3613–21 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26244490 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2015-2338 | url = https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/100/10/3613/2835766/The-Role-of-Bone-Marrow-Fat-in-Skeletal-Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue.&lt;ref name=Raisz/&gt; Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. as a result of menopause) increases bone resorption, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the [[uterus]] and [[Mammary gland|breast gland]]. The α-form of the [[estrogen receptor]] appears to be the most important in regulating bone turnover.&lt;ref name=Raisz/&gt; In addition to estrogen, [[calcium metabolism]] plays a significant role in bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the [[parathyroid gland]]s react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role of [[calcitonin]], a hormone generated by the [[thyroid]] that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH.&lt;ref name=Raisz/&gt;

The activation of osteoclasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which [[RANKL]] (receptor activator of [[NF-κB|nuclear factor kappa-B]] ligand) is one of the best studied. This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g. [[lymphocyte]]s), and stimulates [[RANK]] (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB). [[Osteoprotegerin]] (OPG) binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. RANKL, RANK and OPG are closely related to [[tumor necrosis factor]] and its receptors. The role of the [[Wnt signaling pathway]] is recognized, but less well understood. Local production of [[eicosanoid]]s and [[interleukin]]s is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover, and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis.&lt;ref name=Raisz/&gt;

[[Trabecular bone]] (or cancellous bone) is the sponge-like bone in the ends of long bones and vertebrae. [[Cortical bone]] is the hard outer shell of bones and the middle of long bones. Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of bones, trabecular bone is more active and is more subject to bone turnover and remodeling. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabecular bone break ("microcracks"), and are replaced by weaker bone. Common osteoporotic fracture sites, the wrist, the hip and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio. These areas rely on the trabecular bone for strength, so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Around the ages of 30–35, cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins. Women may lose as much as 50%, while men lose about 30%.&lt;ref name=AppTher /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:L1 2 vertebral fracture.jpg|thumb|Multiple osteoporotic wedge fractures demonstrated on a lateral thoraco-lumbar spine X-ray]]

The diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made using conventional radiography and by measuring the bone mineral density (BMD).&lt;ref name="diagnosticimaging.com"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Guglielmi G, Scalzo G|url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/display/article/113619/1565165|title=Imaging tools transform diagnosis of osteoporosis|journal=Diagnostic Imaging Europe|date=6 May 2010|volume=26|pages=7–11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602030345/http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/display/article/113619/1565165|archivedate=2 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular method of measuring BMD is [[dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]].

In addition to the detection of abnormal BMD, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modifiable underlying causes; this may be done with [[blood tests]]. Depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem, investigations for [[cancer]] with [[metastasis]] to the bone, multiple myeloma, [[Cushing's disease]] and other above-mentioned causes may be performed.

===Conventional radiography===
Conventional radiography is useful, both by itself and in conjunction with CT or MRI, for detecting complications of [[osteopenia]] (reduced bone mass; pre-osteoporosis), such as fractures; for differential diagnosis of osteopenia; or for follow-up examinations in specific clinical settings, such as soft tissue calcifications, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or osteomalacia in renal osteodystrophy. However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires a substantial amount of bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images.

The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow-up. Vertebral height measurements can objectively be made using plain-film X-rays by using several methods such as height loss together with area reduction, particularly when looking at vertical deformity in T4-L4, or by determining a spinal fracture index that takes into account the number of vertebrae involved. Involvement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spine, leading to what is known as [[hyperkyphosis|dowager's hump]].

===Dual-energy X-ray===
[[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DEXA scan) is considered the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the [[bone density|bone mineral density]] is less than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young (30–40-year-old&lt;ref name="WHOcriteria"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:58&lt;/sup&gt;), healthy adult women reference population. This is translated as a [[Bone density#T-score|T-score]]. But because bone density decreases with age, more people become osteoporotic with increasing age.&lt;ref name="WHOcriteria"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:58&lt;/sup&gt; The World Health Organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines:&lt;ref name="WHOcriteria"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO1994/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
! Category !! [[Bone density#T-score|T-score]] range !! % young women
|-
| Normal || [[Bone density#T-score|T-score]] ≥ −1.0 || 85%
|-
| [[Osteopenia]] || −2.5 &lt; T-score &lt; −1.0 || 14%
|-
| Osteoporosis || T-score ≤ −2.5 || 0.6%
|-
| Severe osteoporosis || T-score ≤ −2.5 with fragility fracture&lt;ref name=WHO1994/&gt; ||
|}

The International Society for Clinical Densitometry takes the position that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone. It also states, for premenopausal women, Z-scores (comparison with age group rather than peak bone mass) rather than T-scores should be used, and the diagnosis of osteoporosis in such women also should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone.&lt;ref name="pmid14742881"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leib ES, Lewiecki EM, Binkley N, Hamdy RC |title=Official positions of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry |journal=J Clin Densitom |volume=7 |issue=1 | year=2004 |pmid=14742881 | doi=10.1385/JCD:7:1:1 |pages=1–5}} quoted in: [http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&amp;doc_id=6567&amp;nbr=4129 "Diagnosis of osteoporosis in men, premenopausal women, and children"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224001118/http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&amp;doc_id=6567&amp;nbr=4129 |date=24 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomarkers===
Chemical [[biomarkers]] are a useful tool in detecting bone degradation. The enzyme [[cathepsin K]] breaks down [[Type I collagen|type-I collagen]], an important constituent in bones. Prepared antibodies can recognize the resulting fragment, called a neoepitope, as a way to diagnose osteoporosis.&lt;ref name="pmid15876399"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yasuda Y, Kaleta J, Brömme D | title = The role of cathepsins in osteoporosis and arthritis: rationale for the design of new therapeutics | journal = Adv.

===Other measuring tools===
[[Quantitative computed tomography]] (QCT) differs from DXA in that it gives separate estimates of BMD for trabecular and cortical bone and reports precise volumetric mineral density in mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; rather than BMD's relative Z-score. Among QCT's advantages: it can be performed at axial and peripheral sites, can be calculated from existing CT scans without a separate radiation dose, is sensitive to change over time, can analyze a region of any size or shape, excludes irrelevant tissue such as fat, muscle, and air, and does not require knowledge of the patient's subpopulation in order to create a clinical score (e.g. the Z-score of all females of a certain age). Among QCT's disadvantages: it requires a high radiation dose compared to DXA, CT scanners are large and expensive, and because its practice has been less standardized than BMD, its results are more operator-dependent. Peripheral QCT has been introduced to improve upon the limitations of DXA and QCT.&lt;ref name="diagnosticimaging.com"/&gt;

Quantitative [[ultrasound]] has many advantages in assessing osteoporosis. The modality is small, no ionizing radiation is involved, measurements can be made quickly and easily, and the cost of the device is low compared with DXA and QCT devices. The [[calcaneus]] is the most common skeletal site for quantitative ultrasound assessment because it has a high percentage of trabecular bone that is replaced more often than cortical bone, providing early evidence of metabolic change. Also, the calcaneus is fairly flat and parallel, reducing repositioning errors. The method can be applied to children, neonates, and preterm infants, just as well as to adults.&lt;ref name="diagnosticimaging.com"/&gt; Some ultrasound devices can be used on the [[tibia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medgadget.com/2016/05/bindex-a-radiation-free-device-for-osteoporosis-screening-fda-cleared.html Bindex, a Radiation-Free Device for Osteoporosis Screening, FDA Cleared.

[[Vitamin K deficiency]] is also a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. The gene [[Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase|gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX)]] is dependent on vitamin K. Functional polymorphisms in the gene could attribute to variation in bone metabolism and BMD. [[Vitamin K2]] is also used as a means of treatment for osteoporosis and the polymorphisms of GGCX could explain the individual variation in the response to treatment of vitamin K.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Genetic aspects of osteoporosis|last = Hosoi|first = T|date = 2010|journal = Journal of Bone and Mineral Metabolism|doi = 10.1007/s00774-010-0217-9|pmid = 20697753|access-date =|volume=28|issue = 6|pages=601–07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although people with osteoporosis have increased mortality due to the complications of fracture, the fracture itself is rarely lethal.

Hip fractures can lead to decreased mobility and additional risks of numerous complications (such as [[deep venous thrombosis]] and/or pulmonary embolism, and [[pneumonia]]). The six-month mortality rate for those aged 50 and above following hip fracture was found to be around 13.5%, with a substantial proportion (almost 13%) needing total assistance to mobilize after a hip fracture.&lt;ref name="pmid11386929"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hannan EL, Magaziner J, Wang JJ, Eastwood EA, Silberzweig SB, Gilbert M, Morrison RS, McLaughlin MA, Orosz GM, Siu AL | title = Mortality and locomotion 6 months after hospitalization for hip fracture: risk factors and risk-adjusted hospital outcomes | journal = JAMA | volume = 285 | issue = 21 | pages = 2736–42 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11386929 | doi = 10.1001/jama.285.21.2736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertebral fractures, while having a smaller impact on mortality, can lead to a severe chronic pain of neurogenic origin, which can be hard to control, as well as deformity. Though rare, multiple vertebral fractures can lead to such severe hunch back ([[kyphosis]]), the resulting pressure on internal organs can impair one's ability to breathe.

Apart from risk of death and other complications, osteoporotic fractures are associated with a reduced health-related [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brenneman SK, Barrett-Connor E, Sajjan S, Markson LE, Siris ES |title=Impact of recent fracture on health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women |journal=J. Bone Miner. Res. |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=809–16 |year=2006 |pmid=16753011 |doi=10.1359/jbmr.060301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The condition is responsible for millions of fractures annually, mostly involving the lumbar vertebrae, hip, and wrist. Fragility fractures of ribs are also common in men.

===Hip fractures===
Hip fractures are responsible for the most serious consequences of osteoporosis. In the United States, more than 250,000 hip fractures annually are attributable to osteoporosis.&lt;ref name=RiggsEtAl2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Riggs BL, Melton LJ | title = The worldwide problem of osteoporosis: insights afforded by epidemiology | journal = Bone | volume = 17 | issue = 5 Suppl | pages = 505S–11S | year = 1995 |  pmid = 8573428 | doi = 10.1016/8756-3282(95)00258-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 50-year-old white woman is estimated to have a 17.5% lifetime risk of fracture of the proximal [[femur]]. The incidence of hip fractures increases each decade from the sixth through the ninth for both women and men for all populations. The highest incidence is found among men and women ages 80 or older.&lt;ref name='Merkepid'/&gt;

===Vertebral fractures===

Between 35 and 50% of all women over 50 had at least one [[vertebral fracture]]. In the United States, 700,000 vertebral fractures occur annually, but only about a third are recognized. In a series of 9704 women aged 68.8 on average studied for 15 years, 324 had already suffered a vertebral fracture at entry into the study and 18.2% developed a vertebral fracture, but that risk rose to 41.4% in women who had a previous vertebral fracture.&lt;ref name="pmid18165669"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cauley JA, Hochberg MC, Lui LY, Palermo L, Ensrud KE, Hillier TA, Nevitt MC, Cummings SR | title = Long-term risk of incident vertebral fractures | journal = JAMA | volume = 298 | issue = 23 | pages = 2761–67 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18165669 | doi = 10.1001/jama.298.23.2761 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrist fractures===
In the United States, 250,000 [[Distal radius fracture|wrist fractures]] annually are attributable to osteoporosis.&lt;ref name=RiggsEtAl2005/&gt; Wrist fractures are the third most common type of osteoporotic fractures. The lifetime risk of sustaining a [[Colles' fracture]] is about 16% for white women. By the time women reach age 70, about 20% have had at least one wrist fracture.&lt;ref name='Merkepid'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/diseasemodules/osteoporosis/epidemiology.jsp |title=MerckMedicus Modules: Osteoporosis – Epidemiology |accessdate=2008-06-13 |publisher=Merck &amp; Co., Inc |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228030929/http://www.merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/diseasemodules/osteoporosis/epidemiology.jsp |archivedate = 28 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rib fractures===
Fragility fractures of the ribs are common in men as young as age 35. These are often overlooked as signs of osteoporosis, as these men are often physically active and suffer the fracture in the course of physical activity. An example would be as a result of falling while water skiing or jet skiing. However, a quick test of the individual's testosterone level following the diagnosis of the fracture will readily reveal whether that individual might be at risk.

About 22 million women and 5.5 million men in the [[European Union]] had osteoporosis in 2010.&lt;ref name=Sve2013/&gt; In the United States in 2010 about 8 million women and one to 2 million men had osteoporosis.&lt;ref name=Wade2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Will2015/&gt; This places a large economic burden on the healthcare system due to costs of treatment, long-term disability, and loss of productivity in the working population. The EU spends 37 billion euros per year in healthcare costs related to osteoporosis, and the US spends an estimated 19 billion USD annually for related healthcare costs.&lt;ref name="iofbonehealth.org"/&gt;

==History==
The link between age-related reductions in bone density and fracture risk goes back at least to [[Astley Cooper]], and the term "osteoporosis" and recognition of its pathological appearance is generally attributed to the French pathologist [[Jean Lobstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald N. Grob|title=Aging Bones: A Short History of Osteoporosis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6m3eAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|year=2014|publisher=Johns Hopkins UP|page=5|isbn=9781421413181|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723045135/http://books.google.com/books?id=6m3eAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|archivedate=23 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American endocrinologist [[Fuller Albright]] linked osteoporosis with the postmenopausal state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Albright F, Bloomberg E, Smith PH |year=1940 |title= Postmenopausal osteoporosis |journal=Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians |volume=55 |pages=298–305}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bisphosphonates]] were discovered in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Patlak M |title=Bone builders: the discoveries behind preventing and treating osteoporosis |journal=FASEB J. |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1677E–E|year=2001 |pmid=11481214 |doi= 10.1096/fj.15.10.1677e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropologists]] have studied skeletal remains that showed loss of bone density and associated structural changes that were linked to a chronic malnutrition in the agricultural area in which these individuals lived. "It follows that the skeletal deformation may be attributed to
their heavy labor in agriculture as well as to their chronic malnutrition", causing the osteoporosis seen when radiographs of the remains were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirata K, Morimoto I |title=Vertebral Osteoporosis in Late Edo Japanese |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase1993/102/4/102_4_345/_article |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=345–61 |date=1994 |journal=Anthropological Science |access-date=18 December 2015 |via= |doi=10.1537/ase.102.345 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222141454/https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase1993/102/4/102_4_345/_article |archive-date=22 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osteoporosis means "porous bones", from Greek: οστούν/''ostoun'' meaning "bone" and πόρος/''poros'' meaning "pore".

'''Pelvic congestion syndrome''' (also known as pelvic vein incompetence) is a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] medical condition in women caused by [[varicose veins]] in the lower abdomen. The condition causes [[chronic pain]], often manifesting as a constant dull ache, which can be aggravated by standing.&lt;ref name=interventionalradiology&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sirweb.org/patients/chronic-pelvic-pain/|title=Nonsurgical Treatment for Chronic Pelvic Pain in Women - SIR|publisher=sirweb.org|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early treatment options include pain medication and suppression of [[ovary|ovarian function]]. Surgery can be done using [[noninvasive]] transcatheter techniques to [[embolize]] the varicose veins.&lt;ref name=interventionalradiology/&gt; Up to 80% of women obtain relief using this method.

The condition can occur as a result of pregnancy or for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name=veindirectory&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.veindirectory.org/content/pelvic-congestion-syndrome.asp|title=Pelvic Congestion Syndrome|publisher=veindirectory.org|accessdate=December 23, 2010|date=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of [[estrogen]] in the body causes [[vasodilation]], which can result in the accumulation of blood in the veins in the pelvic area.&lt;ref name=Merck&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/sec22/ch244/ch244c.html|title=Dysmenorrhea|date=December 2008|publisher=Merck Online Medical Manual|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estrogen can weaken the vein walls, leading to the changes that cause varicosities.&lt;ref name=veindirectory/&gt; Up to 15% of all women have varicose veins in the abdominal area, but not all have symptoms.&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Women with this condition experience a constant pain that may be dull and aching, but is occasionally more acute. The pain is worse at the end of the day and after long periods of standing, and sufferers get relief when they lie down. The pain is worse during or after [[sexual intercourse]], and can be worse just before the onset of the [[menstrual period]].&lt;ref name=veindirectory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt;

Women with pelvic congestion syndrome have a larger [[uterus]] and a thicker [[endometrium]]. 56% of women manifest [[cyst]]ic changes to the ovaries,&lt;ref name=Reginald&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pelvicpain.org/docs/newsletters/vision/vol4_no2.aspx|author= Phillip Reginald, MD|publisher=The International Pelvic Pain Society|format=PDF|title=Pelvic Congestion|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many report other symptoms, such as [[dysmenorrhea]], back pain, [[vaginal discharge]], abdominal bloating, mood swings or depression, and fatigue.&lt;ref name=veindirectory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt;

==Causes==
#Local pelvic hormonal melieu
#Venous outflow obstruction, such as [[May-Thurner syndrome]], [[Nutcracker syndrome]], [[Budd-Chiari syndrome]], or left renal vein thrombosis
#External compression due to tumor (including fibroids, endometriosis), or scarring &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rutherford's vascular surgery references.|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0323243053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:9cmFibroidUS.png|thumb|A very large (9cm) [[Uterine fibroid|fibroid]] of the uterus which is causing pelvic congestion syndrome as seen on ultrasound]]
Diagnosis can be made using [[ultrasound]] or [[laparoscopy]] testing. The condition can also be diagnosed with a [[venogram]], [[CT scan]], or an [[MRI]]. Ultrasound is the diagnostic tool most commonly used.&lt;ref name=veindirectory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt; Recent research from a leading pelvic venous unit has suggested that Transvaginal Duplex Ultrasound scanning is the "Gold Standard" test for pelvic venous reflux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Transvaginal duplex ultrasonography appears to be the gold standard investigation for the haemodynamic evaluation of pelvic venous reflux in the ovarian and internal iliac veins in women. |vauthors=Whiteley M, Dos Santos S, Harrison C, Holdstock J, Lopez A |date=Oct 2014 |journal=Phlebology |pmid=25324278 |doi=10.1177/0268355514554638 |volume=30 |pages=706–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same research group has shown that the size of the veins - as shown by venography and also used as the diagnostic criteria in CT and MRI - is not relevant and only Transvaginal Duplex Ultrasound shows the venous reflux that causes the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ejves.com/article/S1078-5884(14)00582-6/abstract |title=Ovarian Vein Diameter Cannot Be Used as an Indicator of Ovarian Venous Reflux. |vauthors=Dos Santos SJ, Holdstock JM, Harrison CC, Lopez AJ, Whiteley MS |accessdate=January 7, 2015 |date=Nov 2014 |publisher=Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Early treatment options include pain medication using [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s,&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt; suppression of [[ovary|ovarian function]],&lt;ref name=Reginald/&gt; and alternative therapies such as [[physical therapy]].&lt;ref name=veindirectory/&gt;

The surgical option involves stopping blood flow to the varicose veins using [[noninvasive]] surgical techniques such as a procedure called embolization. The procedure requires an overnight stay in hospital, and is done using [[local anesthetic]].&lt;ref name=veindirectory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hopkins/&gt; Patients report an 80% success rate, as measured by the amount of pain reduction experienced.&lt;ref name=Hopkins&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/vascular/conditions/pelvic/|title=Pelvic Pain (Pelvic Congestion Syndrome)|publisher=Johns Hopkins|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

Pit latrines are sometimes also referred to as "[[dry toilet]]s" but this is not recommended because a "dry toilet" is an overarching term used for several types of toilets and strictly speaking only refers to the user interface.&lt;ref name=Till2014 /&gt; Depending on the region, the term "pit latrine" may be used to denote a toilet that has a squatting pan with a water seal or siphon (more accurately termed a pour-flush pit latrine – very common in South East Asia for example) or simply a hole in the ground without a water seal (also called a simple pit latrine) – the common type in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Whilst a dry toilet can be with or without [[urine diversion]], a pit latrine is almost always without urine diversion. The key characteristic of a pit latrine is the use of a pit, which infiltrates liquids into the ground and acts as a device for storage and very limited treatment.&lt;ref name=Till2014 /&gt;

=== Improved or unimproved sanitation ===

A pit latrine may or may not count towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) target of increasing access to [[sanitation]] for the world's population, depending on the type of pit latrine: A pit latrine without a slab is regarded as unimproved sanitation and does not count towards the target. A pit latrine with a slab, a ventilated improved pit latrine and a pour flush pit latrine connected to a pit or [[septic tank]] are counted as being "[[improved sanitation]]" facilities as they are more likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact.&lt;ref&gt;WHO and UNICEF [http://www.wssinfo.org/definitions-methods/, definitions of improved drinking-water source on the JMP website], WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York, accessed on 16 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design considerations ==

=== Size of the drop hole ===

The user positions themself over the small drop hole during use. The size of the feces drop hole in the floor or slab should not be larger than 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) to prevent children falling in.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO3.4 /&gt; --&gt; Light should be prevented from entering the pit to reduce access by flies.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO3.4 /&gt; --&gt; 

=== Lids on the drop hole or toilet seat ===
A lid on the drop hole keeps light out of the pit and helps to stop flies and odors entering the toilet's superstructure.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO3.4 /&gt; --&gt; The lid can be made from plastic or wood and is used to cover the hole in the floor when the pit latrine is not in use.&lt;ref name="WHO3.4" /&gt; In practice, such a lid is not commonly used for squatting type pit latrines but only for sitting type pit latrines with a [[toilet seat]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Squatting pan or toilet seat ===

On top of the drop hole there can either be nothing (this is the simplest form of a pit latrine) or there can be a squatting pan, seat (pedestal) or bench which can be made of concrete, ceramic, plastic or wood.

=== Shelter ===
{{Main|Outhouse}}

A shelter, shed, small building or "super-structure" houses the squatting pan or toilet seat and provides privacy and protection from the weather for the user. Ideally, the shelter or small building should have handwashing facilities available inside or on the outside (e.g. supplied with water from a [[rainwater harvesting]] tank on the roof of the shelter) although this is unfortunately rarely the case in practice. In the shelter, anal cleansing materials (e.g. toilet paper) and a solid waste bin should also be available. A more substantial structure may also be built, commonly known as an [[outhouse]].

=== Locating the pit ===

[[File:Pit latrine close to well in Lusaka, Zambia.jpg|thumb|Common problem: [[water well]] (forefront) is in close proximity to the pit latrine (brick building at the back), leading to [[groundwater pollution]] (example from [[Lusaka]], Zambia)]]

Liquids leach from the pit and pass the unsaturated soil zone (which is not completely filled with water). Subsequently, these liquids from the pit enter the groundwater where they may lead to [[groundwater pollution]]. This is a problem if a nearby [[water well]] is used to supply groundwater for [[drinking water]] purposes. During the passage in the soil, pathogens can die off or be absorbed significantly, mostly depending on the travel time between the pit and the well.&lt;ref&gt;DVGW (2006) [http://www.beuth.de/en/technical-rule/dvgw-w-101/92562980 Guidelines on drinking water protection areas – Part 1: Groundwater protection areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029043136/http://www.beuth.de/en/technical-rule/dvgw-w-101/92562980 |date=29 October 2014 }}.

Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of pathogen removal strongly varies with soil type, aquifer type, distance and other environmental factors.&lt;ref name=Graham2013 /&gt; For this reason, it is difficult to estimate the safe distance between a pit and a water source – a problem that also applies to [[septic tank]]s. Detailed guidelines have been developed to estimate safe distances to protect [[groundwater]] sources from pollution from on-site [[sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;ARGOSS (2001).

In addition to that, household plots are of a limited size and therefore pit latrines are often built much closer to groundwater wells than what can be regarded as safe. This results in [[groundwater pollution]] and household members falling sick when using this groundwater as a source of drinking water.

As a very general guideline it is recommended that the bottom of the pit should be at least 2&amp;nbsp;m above&amp;nbsp;groundwater&amp;nbsp;level, and a minimum horizontal distance of 30&amp;nbsp;m between a pit and a water source is normally recommended to limit exposure to microbial contamination.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;However, no general statement should be made regarding the minimum lateral separation distances required to prevent contamination of a well from a pit latrine.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, L., Nick, A., Cronin, A. (2015).

Sustainable Sanitation Alliance&lt;/ref&gt; For example, even 50&amp;nbsp;m lateral separation distance might not be sufficient in a strongly [[karst]]ified system with a downgradient supply well or spring, while 10&amp;nbsp;m lateral separation distance is completely sufficient if there is a well developed clay cover layer and the annular space of the groundwater well is well sealed.

If the local hydrogeological conditions (which can vary within a space of a few square kilometres) are ignored, pit latrines can cause significant public health risks via contaminated groundwater. In addition to the issue of pathogens, there is also the issue of nitrate pollution in groundwater from pit latrines. Elevated nitrate levels in drinking water from private wells is thought to have caused cases of [[blue baby syndrome]] in children in rural areas of Romania and Bulgaria in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Buitenkamp, M., Richert Stintzing, A.

=== Pit lining ===

==== Partial ====

Pits can be lined with a support ring at the top of the pit as shown in this schematic.]]

[[File:Arborloo construction in Cap-Haitien - 1 - Pit digging.jpg|thumb|Digging the pit for an Arborloo, a type of pit toilet in Cap-Haitien, Haiti]]

A "partially lined" pit latrine is one where the upper part of the hole in the ground is lined. Pit lining materials can include brick, rot-resistant timber, concrete, stones, or mortar plastered onto the soil.&lt;ref name=Till2014 /&gt; This partial lining is recommended for those pit latrine used by a great number of people — such as a public restroom in rural areas,  or in a woodland park or busy lay-by, rest stop or other similarly busy location — or where the soils are unstable in order to increase permanence and allow emptying of the pit without it collapsing easily. The bottom of the pit should remain unlined to allow for the infiltration of liquids out of the pit.

==== Fully ====

A fully lined pit latrine has concrete lining also at the base so that no liquids infiltrate into the ground. One could argue that this is no longer a "pit" latrine in the stricter sense. The advantage is that no [[groundwater]] contamination can occur. The major disadvantage is that a fully lined pit latrine fills up very fast (as the urine cannot escape the pit) which results in high costs to empty and maintain the latrine. Increased odour can also be an issue as the pit content is much wetter and emits more odour. This type of pit latrine is used only in special circumstances, e.g. in denser settlements where groundwater protection is paramount.

=== Appropriateness ===

Pit latrines are often built in developing countries even in situations where they are not recommended. These include (adapted from&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rieck, C., von Münch, E., Hoffmann, H. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/874 Technology review of urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) – Overview on design, management, maintenance and costs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316220755/http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/874 |date=16 March 2016 }}. Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;):
* Frequent flooding, resulting in inoperable toilet systems and the contamination of water resources;
* Unfavourable soil conditions, such as unstable or rocky soil and high water table, making pit-based sanitation difficult and expensive;
* When groundwater is the primary source of drinking water and is likely to be contaminated by pit-based sanitation (for example in denser settlements or with unfavourable hydrogeological conditions);
* Limited land space restricts the excavation of new pits if full pit latrines are usually not emptied;
* Indoor installations are preferred as they provide greater comfort and security at night thus making them more accessible for all
In conditions where pit latrines are not suitable for the above-mentioned reasons, the installations of other types of toilets should be considered, e.g. the [[urine-diverting dry toilet]] (UDDT).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Types ==

Pit latrines collect [[human feces]] in a hole in the ground. The principle of a pit latrine is that all liquids that enter the pit{{nsmdns}}in particular [[urine]] and water used for anal cleansing{{nsmdns}}seep into the ground (the only exception are fully lined pit latrines, see below).

=== Ventilated improved pit ===

The ventilated improved pit latrine (VIP) is a pit latrine with a black pipe (vent pipe) fitted to the pit and a screen (flyscreen) at the top outlet of the pipe. VIP latrines are an improvement to overcome the disadvantages of simple pit latrines, e.g. fly and mosquito nuisance and unpleasant odors. The smell is carried upwards by the chimney effect and flies are prevented from leaving the pit and spreading disease.&lt;ref name="Till2014" /&gt;

The principal mechanism of ventilation in VIP latrines is the action of wind blowing across the top of the vent pipe. The wind creates a strong circulation of air through the superstructure, down through the squat hole, across the pit and up and out of the vent pipe. Unpleasant fecal odors from the pit contents are thus sucked up and exhausted out of vent pipe, leaving the superstructure odor-free. In some cases solar-powered fans are added giving a constant outwards flow from the vent pipe.

Flies searching for an egg-laying site are attracted by fecal odors coming from the vent pipe, but they are prevented from entering by the flyscreen at the outlet of the vent pipe. Some flies may enter into the pit via the squat hole and lay their eggs there. When new adult flies emerge, they instinctively fly towards light. However, if the latrine is dark inside, the only light they can see is at the top of the vent pipe. Since the vent pipe is covered by a fly screen at the top, flies will not be able to escape and eventually will die and fall back into the pit.

To ensure that there is a flow of air through the latrine, there must be adequate ventilation of the superstructure. This is usually achieved by leaving openings above and below the door, or by constructing a spiral wall without a door.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, M.F. &amp; Rahman, M.M. (2003). Water Supply &amp; Sanitation: Rural and Low Income Urban Communities, 2nd Edition, ITN-Bangladesh. {{ISBN|984-31-0936-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Covering the feces with an absorbent decreases smell and discourages flies. These may include soil, sawdust, ash, or lime, among others.&lt;ref name="VIP2003" /&gt; In developing countries, the use of absorbents in pit toilets is not commonly practiced.

=== Twin pit designs ===
[[File:Twin Pits for Pour Flush diagram.svg|thumb|Design of a twin pit latrine.]]
A further possible improvement is the use of a second pit which is used in alternation with the first pit. It means that the first pit can rest for the duration of time it takes to fill up the second pit. When the second pit is also full, then the first pit is emptied. The fecal sludge collected in that first pit has in the meantime undergone some degree of pathogen reduction although this is unlikely to be complete. This is a common design for so-called twin-pit pour flush toilets and increases the safety for those having to enter the pit.&lt;ref name="Till2014" /&gt; Also VIPs are sometimes built with two pits, although for VIP toilets one problem can be that the users may not stick to this alternation method and fill up both pits at the same time.

=== Pour-flush pit latrine ===

[[File:Pour flush toilet - squatting pan with water seal (schematic).jpg|thumb|Pour-flush pit latrine schematic showing squatting pan with water seal]]

In a pour-flush pit latrine, a squatting or pedestal toilet with a water seal (U-trap or siphon) is used over one or two offset pits. Therefore, these types of toilets do require water for flushing but otherwise have many of the same characteristics as simple pit latrines. About one to three liters of water is used per flush in that case, and they often have two pits that are used one after the other ("twin pit pour flush pit latrine"). For this reason they are subsumed under the term "pit latrine". The fecal sludge that is removed from the full pits of twin-pit pour-flush pit latrines is somewhat safer to handle and reuse than the fecal sludge from single pit pour-flush latrines. However, significant health risks for the workers who are emptying the pits remain in either case.

An alternative to U-trap or siphon designs is to incorporate a counter-weighted trap door mechanism that provides an air-tight water seal in the closed position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thewalrus.ca/the-toilet-papers/|title=The Toilet Papers|website=thewalrus.ca|access-date=10 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311024941/https://thewalrus.ca/the-toilet-papers/|archivedate=11 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Addition of a small amount of water (generally less than 500&amp;nbsp;ml) overcomes the counterweight and allows the fecal matter to enter the pit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=American Standard|title=Flush for Good: American Standard's Sanitary Toilet Pan Tested in Bangladesh|date=7 March 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWyF5TSxWso|accessdate=10 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516173610/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWyF5TSxWso|archivedate=16 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The devices are sold under the name of "SaTo pan" for as little as US$1.85, and more than 800,000 of them have been installed worldwide since introduction in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/272034/this-1-85-toilet-could-save-millions-of-lives/|title=This $1.85 toilet could save millions of lives|website=Quartz|language=en-US|access-date=10 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220083030/http://qz.com/272034/this-1-85-toilet-could-save-millions-of-lives/|archivedate=20 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cat hole ===

A [[cathole|cat hole]] is a one-time-use pit toilet often utilized by [[camping|campers]], [[hiker]]s and other [[outdoor]] recreationalists. It is also called the "cat method" and simply means digging a little hole just large enough for the feces of one defecation event which is afterwards covered with soil.

== Maintenance ==

[[File:Manual pit emptying (8151995298).jpg|thumb|Manual pit emptying of a pit latrine near Durban, South Africa]]

[[File:Passing the faecal sludge to the top of the pit latrine.jpg|thumb|Bad practice example: A worker removing [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] from the pit of a pit latrine without wearing any [[personal protective equipment]] (in a village in [[Burkina Faso]]). ]]

[[File:Dumping of faecal sludge into the river.jpg|thumb|Bad practice example: Fecal sludge that has been manually removed from pits is dumped into the local river at [[Korogocho]] slum near Nairobi, Kenya]]

The requirements for safe pit emptying and [[fecal sludge management]] are often forgotten by those building pit latrines, as the pit will only fill up in a few years time. However, in many developing countries safe fecal sludge management practices are lacking and causing public health risks as well as environmental pollution.&lt;ref name="Still2012" /&gt; Fecal sludge that has been removed from pits manually or with vacuum tankers is often dumped into the environment indiscriminately, leading to what has been called "institutionalized [[open defecation]]".

=== Pit emptying ===
{{Further|Fecal sludge management}}
When the pit is full, the toilet is no longer usable. The time it takes to fill the pit depends on its volume, the number of users, the soil permeability and groundwater level. It can typically take between one and ten years or even longer in some exceptional cases. At that point, the pit can be covered and abandoned, and a new pit latrine built if space on the property permits this. The new pit latrine may reuse the shelter (superstructure) if the shelter can be moved without collapsing. In peri-urban or urban areas, full pits are not abandoned but rather emptied so that the toilets can continue to be used at the same location after the emptying has taken place. 

The emptying can be done manually with shovels and buckets, with manually powered pumps or with motorized pumps mounted on a [[vacuum truck]] which carries a tank for storage.&lt;ref name="Still2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Still|first1=David|last2=Foxon|first2=Kitty|title=Tackling the challenges of full pit latrines : report to the Water Research Commission|date=2012|publisher=Water Research Commission|location=Gezina [South Africa]|isbn=978-1-4312-0293-5|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1712|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112241/http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1712|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the fecal sludge to be pumpable, water usually needs to be added to the pit and the content stirred up, which is messy and smelly.

Procedures for safe emptying of fecal sludge from pit latrines is a priority for many developing countries where many new pit latrines have been built in rural areas in recent years, such as in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balasubramanya|first=Soumya|last2=Evans|first2=Barbara|last3=Ahmed|first3=Rizwan|last4=Habib|first4=Ahasan|last5=Asad|first5=N.

In India, the manual emptying of pits with shovels and buckets is called [[manual scavenging]] and is regarded as a [[Caste system in India|caste]]-based [[Dehumanization|dehumanizing]] practice. It has been made illegal in 1993 but continues to take place. 

In [[Haiti]], the workers who empty pits of pit latrines are called [[Bayakou (trade)|bayakou]].

=== Sludge management ===
{{Further|Fecal sludge management}}
The [[faecal sludge|fecal sludge]] may be transported by road to a [[sewage treatment]] facility, or to be composted elsewhere. There are numerous licensed waste hauling companies providing such service in areas where it is needed in developed countries, although in developing countries such services are not well regulated and are often carried out by untrained, unskilled and unprotected informal workers.

When managed and treated correctly to achieve a high degree of pathogen kill, fecal sludge from pit latrines could be used as a fertilizer due to its high nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter content. However, it is hard to ensure that this is done in a safe manner. The number of viable [[helminths|helminth]] eggs is commonly used as an [[indicator organism]] to make a statement about the pathogen load in a fecal sludge sample. Helminth eggs are very persistent to most treatment methods and are therefore a good indicator.

=== Pit additives ===
{{Further|Pit additive}}

A range of commercial products are available which claim to help reduce the volume of feces in the pit, and reduce odor and fly problems. They are collectively described as a [[pit additive]] and many of them are based on the concept of [[effective microorganisms]]. The intention is to add specific strains of microbes to aid the decomposition process – but their effectiveness is disputed and recent research found no effect in scientific test conditions.&lt;ref name="BakareBrouckaert2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bakare|first1=BF|last2=Brouckaert|first2=CJ|last3=Foxon|first3=KM|last4=Buckley|first4=CA|title=An investigation of the effect of pit latrine additives on VIP latrine sludge content under laboratory and field trials|journal=Water SA|volume=41|issue=4|year=2015|page=509|issn=0378-4738|doi=10.4314/wsa.v41i4.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foxon, K., Still, D. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2162 Do pit additives work?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213123043/http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2162 |date=13 February 2015 }} Water Research Commission (WRC), University of KwaZulu-Natal, Partners in Development (PiD), South Africa&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wood ash]], leaves, soil, [[compost]], or [[sawdust]] can be sprinkled on top of the feces to decrease the smell in the case of pit latrines without a water seal.&lt;ref name="VIP2003" /&gt; This is however not common practice for users in developing countries. Users often do not expect a pit latrine to be odour free, and endure the smell. 

== Advantages ==

Advantages of pit latrines may include:&lt;ref name="Till2014" /&gt;
* Can be built and repaired with locally available materials
* Low (but variable) capital costs depending on materials and pit depth
* Small land area required

Measures to improve access to [[safe water]], sanitation and better hygiene, which includes the use of pit latrines instead of [[open defecation]], is believed to be able to prevent nearly 90% of deaths due to infectious diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=WHO|first1=UNICEF|title=Diarrhoea : why children are still dying and what can be done|date=2009|publisher=United Nations Children's Fund|location=New York|isbn=978-92-806-4462-3|page=2|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598415_eng.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019153745/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598415_eng.pdf|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

Disadvantages of pit latrines may include:&lt;ref name=Till2014 /&gt;
* Flies and odours are normally noticeable to the users
* The toilet has to be outdoors with the associated security risks if the person is living in an insecure situation
* Low reduction in organic matter content and pathogens
* Possible [[groundwater pollution|contamination of groundwater]] with pathogens and nitrate
* Costs to empty the pits may be significant compared to capital costs
* Pit emptying is often done in a very unsafe manner
* Sludge (called fecal sludge) requires further treatment and/or appropriate discharge
* Pit latrines are often relocated or re-built after some years (when the pit is full and if the pit is not emptied) and thus need more space than [[urine-diverting dry toilet]]s for example and people are less willing to invest in a high-quality super-structure as it will have to be dismantled at some point.

== Costs ==

=== Construction ===
In developing countries the construction cost for a simple pit toilet is between about {{US$|25{{nbsp}}and{{nbsp}}60|link=yes}}.&lt;ref name=Wiley2011/&gt; This cost figure has a wide range because the costs vary a lot depending on the type of soil, the depth and reinforcement of the pit, the superstructure that the user is willing to pay for, the type of toilet squatting pan or toilet seat chosen, the cost of labour, construction materials (in particular the cost of cement can differ a lot from one country to the next), the ventilation system and so forth.

Rather than looking only at the construction cost, the whole of life cost (or life-cycle cost) should be considered, as the regular emptying or re-building of pit latrines may add a significant expense to the households in the longer term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=McIntyre, P. | author2=Casella D. | author3=Fonseca, C. | author4=Burr, P | title=Priceless! Uncovering the real costs of water  and sanitation | publisher=The Hague: IRC | isbn=978-90-6687-082-6 | url=http://www.ircwash.org/sites/default/files/2014_priceless_mcintyreetal_0.pdf | accessdate=22 May 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313115300/http://www.ircwash.org/sites/default/files/2014_priceless_mcintyreetal_0.pdf | archivedate=13 March 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, Japan's [[Lixil Group|LIXIL Group]] has supplied tens of thousands of twin pit toilet systems that costs $10 or less apiece (in 2018).&lt;ref name="Boom2018" /&gt;

=== Recurrent expenditure ===
[[Expense|Recurring expenditure]] costs are between US$1.5 and $4 per person per year for a traditional pit latrine.&lt;ref name="IWA2017" /&gt; This includes operational and minor expenditure, capital maintenance expenditure and ependiture on direct support but does not include pit emptying costs. The total recurrent expenditure for more "upmarket" pit latrines has been estimated to be $2.5-8.5 for a VIP-type pit latrine and $3.5-11.5 for a pour-flush pit latrine.&lt;ref name="IWA2017" /&gt;

== Society and culture ==

=== User experiences ===

[[File:Existing pit latrines of the schools (5324341452).jpg|thumb|Poorly maintained pit latrine at Ambira Boys High School, Nyanza Province, Kenya]]

Pit latrines may or may not be an enjoyable experience to use. Problems may occur when the pit latrine is shared by too many people, is not cleaned daily and not emptied when the pit is full. In such cases, flies and odour can be a major nuisance. Also, pit latrines are usually dark places which are difficult to keep clean. Often, handwashing facilities are missing. For these reasons, shared pit latrines can be very uncomfortable to use in developing countries. 

=== Alternative to open defecation ===

About 892 million people, or 12 percent of the global population, practiced [[open defecation]] in 2016, mostly because they have no toilets.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt; [[Southern Asia]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] have the lowest access to toilets.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt; Pit latrines are a low cost toilet option that do not require expensive infrastructure. As such, many government agencies and NGOs promote the construction of pit latrines in rural areas ([[groundwater pollution]] can be an issue). 

The [[community-led total sanitation]] approach results in the spontaneous construction and sustained use of pit latrines rather than [[open defecation]].

===India example===
The Indian government has been running the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Mission) since 2014 in order to eliminate open defecation and to convince people in rural areas to purchase, construct and use toilets, mainly pit latrines.&lt;ref name=Boom2018/&gt; This campaign is a combination of building new toilets and encouraging [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]]. It is estimated that 50 million additional pit latrines have been built due to that campaign between 2014 and 2017.&lt;ref name=Fact2017/&gt;  

Another example is the campaign that took place in [[Haryana]] with slogans such as "No Toilet, No Bride" or "No loo, no "I do"". This campaign promotes the construction of toilets (usually pour flush pit latrine toilets).&lt;ref name=Cam2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haryana2014/&gt; In rural India, there are sometimes cultural preferences for open defecation and these may be difficult to overcome with unattractive toilet designs, such as pit latrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clasen|first1=Thomas|last2=Boisson|first2=Sophie|last3=Routray|first3=Parimita|last4=Torondel|first4=Belen|last5=Bell|first5=Melissa|last6=Cumming|first6=Oliver|last7=Ensink|first7=Jeroen|last8=Freeman|first8=Matthew|last9=Jenkins|first9=Marion|year=2014|title=Effectiveness of a rural sanitation programme on diarrhoea, soil-transmitted helminth infection, and child malnutrition in Odisha, India: a cluster-randomised trial|journal=The Lancet Global Health|volume=2|issue=11|pages=e645|doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(14)70307-9|pmid=25442689|last10=Odagiri|first10=Mitsunori|last11=Ray|first11=Subhajyoti|last12=Sinha|first12=Antara|last13=Suar|first13=Mrutyunjay|last14=Schmidt|first14=Wolf-Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=October 2009}}
'''Preventive detention''' is an [[imprisonment]] that is putatively justified for non-[[punishment|punitive]] purposes.

A related, but different form of detention, is detention of suspects or [[Remand (detention)|remand]]. In contrast to preventive detention, detention of suspects must quickly be followed by a criminal charge (or happen after the charge).

In most jurisdictions, people suffering from serious mental illness may be subject to [[involuntary commitment]] under mental health legislation. This is undertaken on health grounds or in order to protect the person or others. It does not strictly speaking constitute a form of preventive detention, because the person is detained for treatment and released once this has proven effective.

==Specific jurisdictions==

===Australia===
Australia laws authorize preventive detention in a variety of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203807774|title=Dangerous People|language=en-US|doi=10.4324/9780203807774}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[mandatory detention in Australia]] (a form of [[immigration detention]]) is applied to asylum seekers who arrive in Australian territorial waters or territory, until their status as an asylum seeker is established.

In Australia's most populous State, New South Wales, preventive detention regimes have established powers to detain or to continuously monitor and limit particular activities of those who were once convicted of various serious sexual and violent offences. Recently, this has been extended, with the State government now able to control the free movement, speech, association and work of individuals and businesses via Serious Crime Prevention Orders (‘SCPOs’).&lt;ref&gt;''Crimes (Serious Crime Prevention Orders) Act 2016'' (NSW)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on provisions in the United Kingdom, a range of state officials may apply to the NSW District or Supreme Courts to create an SCPO consisting of any conditions they consider appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;''Crimes (Serious Crime Prevention Orders) Act 2016'' (NSW) ss 5-7&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions may include positive obligations - such as an obligation to report to a police station - or negative ‘prohibitions’ or ‘restrictions’, for instance, a prohibition on travelling beyond a certain location. Failure to comply with the SCPO, carries with it a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;''Crimes (Serious Crime Prevention Orders) Act 2016'' (NSW) s 8&lt;/ref&gt;

SCPOs have been described as a "watershed extension of state power in New South Wales"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Methven|first=Elyse|last2=Carter|first2=David J.|date=2016|title=Serious Crime Prevention Orders|url=https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/74815|journal=Current Issues in Criminal Justice|publisher=|volume=28|issue=2|pages=223–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; by legal academics, and were strongly opposed by the legal community when they were introduced and passed into with less than two weeks' consideration by the Parliament of NSW.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], anyone declared a [[dangerous offender]] by the courts is subject to an indefinite period of detention

===Costa Rica===
In [[Costa Rica]], the 1998 Criminal Proceedings Code allows for a normal pre-trial "''prisión preventiva''" or [[Remand (detention)|remand]]&lt;ref name=Q2013/&gt; of 12 months if the person is considered a "flight risk", but if the case is declared "complex", it can be increased to up to three years and a half of imprisonment without conviction, or even more in some cases. As of 23 May 2013, over 3,000 people were in pre-trial detention.&lt;ref name=Q2013&gt;{{cite web |url= http://qcostarica.com/in-costa-rica-17-persons-ordered-daily-to-preventive-detention/ |title=In Costa Rica 17 persons ordered daily to preventive detention |date=30 June 2013 |work=QCostarica.com |publisher=Q Media |accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
The police can detain people for 6 hours without involving the courts or pay compensation for wrongful arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politi.dk/da/loveogrettigheder/politiloven/ The police law {{dk icon}}], Web page of the Danish police&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the ongoing gang war in Copenhagen between the biker gangs and second generation youth gangs it has been suggested to extend the 6 hour limit to several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Regioner/Kbh/Nyheder/Koebenhavn/2009/02/22/114719.htm S vil sætte bandekrigen bag tremmer], by Bente Lund, Denmarks Radio, February 22, 2009 {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]] a new set of [[State of emergency|emergency laws]] was introduced allowing the police to detain people for up to 12 hours without charging them for a crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2009/11/26/104519.htm Hårdt politisk opgør før Folketinget sagde ja til lømmelpakken], by Jens Ringberg, Denmarks Radio, November 26, 2009 {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics fear that they will remain as permanent laws when the summit is over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politiken.dk/indland/article833988.ece Lømmelpakken bekymrer dommerne], Politiken, November 13, 2009 {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--different definition so this is a level 2 heading where above the countries are level 3--&gt;

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], "preventive detention" (German: ''Sicherungsverwahrung'', [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#StGBengl_000P66 §66 [[Strafgesetzbuch]]]) has a similar meaning to that in New Zealand. Sicherungsverwahrung can only be imposed as part of a criminal sentence, and it is handed down to individuals who have committed a grave offence and are considered a danger to public safety. It is an indeterminate sentence that follows a regular jail sentence. To assure the suitability of the preventive detention, it has to be reviewed every two years to determine the ongoing threat posed by the individual. Preventive detention is typically served in regular prisons, though separated from regular prisoners and with certain privileges.

The Sicherungsverwahrung is usually imposed in the original verdict, but can be imposed later under certain circumstances. This practice of subsequent incapacitation orders was ruled a violation of Art 7 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=860012&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649l|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a huge discussion in Germany over the handling of this verdict occurred. In reaction to this the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] issued a verdict on Sicherungsverwahrung in May 2011, deeming it unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15046630,00.html|title=German court rules preventive detention unconstitutional - Germany - DW.COM - 04.05.2011|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a new law regulating Sicherungsverwahrung was passed in November 2012
.&lt;ref&gt;Gesetz zur bundesrechtlichen Umsetzung des Abstandsgebotes im Recht der Sicherungsverwahrung (BR-Drs. 689/12) {{cite web |url=http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_320/nn_8336/SharedDocs/Drucksachen/2012/0601-700/689-12,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/689-12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019193120/http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_320/nn_8336/SharedDocs/Drucksachen/2012/0601-700/689-12,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/689-12.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }} (PDF; 266&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In [[India]], preventive detention can be extended for up to six months. After three months, such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.

Preventive detention in India dates from British rule in the early 1800s, and continued with such laws as the Defence of India Act 1939 and the Preventive Detention Act 1950.&lt;ref&gt;A. Faizur Rahman, "[http://www.thehindu.com/op/2004/09/07/stories/2004090700101500.htm Preventive detention an anachronism]", ''The Hindu'', 7 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial ''[[Maintenance of Internal Security Act]]'' was enacted by Indian parliament during [[Indira Gandhi]] prime ministership in 1971, however it was amended several times during [[Indian Emergency|national emergency]] (1975-1977), leading to human right violations. It was subsequently repealed after Indira Gandhi lost the election in 1977, and the new government took over.&lt;ref name="Saxena2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saxena|first=Priti|title=Preventive Detention and Human Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2k3QCHpcroC&amp;pg=PA99|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications|isbn=978-81-7629-992-3|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{See also|Daiyo_kangoku|Public order and internal security in Japan}}
In [[Japan]], pre-trial detention of a suspect can be for up to 23 days without charge. The length of detention, up to the maximum period, is at the discretion of the public prosecutor and subject to the approval of local courts. It can also be further extended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=214811 Code of Criminal Procedure (Act No. 131 of July 10, 1948, as amended in 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia the [[Internal Security Act 1960]] (ISA) was a preventive detention law that was enacted after Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957. The ISA allowed for detention without trial or criminal charges under limited, legally defined circumstances. The ISA was invoked against terrorism activity and against anyone deemed a threat to national security. On 15 September 2011, [[Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak|Najib Razak]], the Prime Minister of Malaysia, said that this legislation would be repealed and replaced by two new laws.&lt;ref name="bernamanajib"&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=613836 Internal Security Act to be abolished, says Najib], 15 September 2011, Bernama.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2012, the [[Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012]] (SOSMA) was approved by the [[Parliament of Malaysia|Malaysian Parliament]] as a replacement for the ISA. It was given the Royal Assent on 18 June 2012 and gazetted on 22 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalgazette.agc.gov.my/outputaktap/20120622_747_BI_Act%20747%20BI.pdf Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Life imprisonment in New Zealand#Preventive detention|Prisoners' rights in New Zealand#Preventive detention}}
In [[New Zealand]], "preventive detention" is an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment, second only to life imprisonment in terms of seriousness. It may be given to offenders aged 18 or over who are convicted of a qualifying sexual or violent offence, and the court is satisfied that the person is likely to commit another qualifying sexual or violent offence if they were given a determinate sentence of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0009/latest/DLM136454.html|title=Sentencing Act 2002 No 9 (as at 22 December 2016), Public Act 87 Sentence of preventive detention – New Zealand Legislation|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preventive detention has a minimum non-parole period of five years in prison, but the sentencing judge can extend this if they believe that the prisoner's history warrants it. A total of 314 people were serving terms of preventive detention in 2013, of whom 34 were on parole.&lt;ref name=Stuff_20130717&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/8926501/A-third-of-Kiwi-life-termers-are-out-on-parole |title=A third of Kiwi life termers are out on parole |last=Sharpe |first=Marty |date=17 July 2013 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Thomas Vincent has been in prison on preventive detention since 1968 and was still there as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Zealand's longest serving prisoner gets half a century behind bars |first=Deidre |last=Mussen |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/72732437/new-zealands-longest-serving-prisoner-gets-half-a-century-behind-bars |newspaper=Stuff |date=11 October 2015 |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
Under [[Apartheid]], the government of South Africa used preventive detention laws to target its political opponents. These included, notably, the [[Terrorism Act, 1967|Terrorism Act of 1967]], which gave police commanders the power to detain terrorists—or people with information about terrorists—without warrant.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Cohen, "[http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/1967-terrorism-act-no-83-1967 1967 Terrorism Act, No. 83 of 1967]", ''South African History Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
[[England and Wales]] used to have provisions, introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government in 2003, to deal with [[dangerous offender]]s similar to what is used in Canada. However, the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 abolished what was called [[Imprisonment for Public Protection]] (IPP) without replacement, although offences committed prior to the coming into force of the 2012 Act may still trigger IPP.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] guarantees the right to "a speedy and public trial". Thus, arrested persons may not be held for extended periods of time without trial. However, since the passage of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] (NDAA), controversy has broken out as to whether or not the U.S. government now has the power to indefinitely detain citizens. Section 1021 and 1022 of the legislation enacted policies described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as allowing indefinite detention "without trial [of] American terrorism suspects arrested on U.S. soil who could then be shipped to Guantánamo Bay".&lt;ref&gt;McGreal, C., "Military given go-ahead to detain US terrorist suspects without trial", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 December 2011: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/15/americans-face-guantanamo-detention-obama].&lt;/ref&gt;

Convicted persons can be held indefinitely as a "[[dangerous offender]]".

'''Recurrent miscarriage''', '''habitual abortion''', or '''recurrent pregnancy loss''' (RPL) is three or more consecutive pregnancy losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeve YB, Davies W | title = Evidence-based management of recurrent miscarriages | journal = Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 159–69 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25395740 | doi = 10.4103/0974-1208.142475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infertility differs because it is the inability to conceive. In many cases the cause of RPL is unknown. After three or more losses, a thorough evaluation is recommended by [[American Society of Reproductive Medicine]].&lt;ref name="asrm.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asrm.org/FACTSHEET_Recurrent_Pregnancy_Loss/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 2, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403170107/https://www.asrm.org/FACTSHEET_Recurrent_Pregnancy_Loss/ |archive-date=April 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1% of couples trying to have children are affected by recurrent miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Repeated Miscarriage FAQ 100 http://www.acog.org/-/media/For-Patients/faq100.pdf?dmc=1&amp;ts=20150820T1255284207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RCOG-recurrent /&gt;

== Causes ==

There are various causes for recurrent miscarriage, and some can be treated. Some couples never have a cause identified, often after extensive investigations.&lt;ref name=RCOG2003&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/GTG17recurrentmiscarriage.pdf |title=The Investigation and Treatment of Couples with Recurrent Miscarriage: Guideline No 17 |format=PDF |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6MGxAAe8u?url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/GTG17recurrentmiscarriage.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 50-75% of cases of Recurrent Miscarriage are unexplained.&lt;ref name="asrm.org"/&gt;

=== Anatomical conditions ===
Fifteen percent of women who have experienced three or more recurring miscarriages have some anatomical reason for the inability to complete the pregnancy.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=181}} The structure of the [[uterus]] has an effect on the ability to carry a child to term. Anatomical differences are common and can be congenital.

==== Cervical conditions ====

In the second trimester a weak [[cervix]] can become a recurrent problem. Such [[cervical incompetence]] leads to premature pregnancy loss resulting in miscarriages or preterm deliveries.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Chromosomal disorders ===

==== Translocations ====

A [[Chromosomal translocation|balanced translocation]] or [[Robertsonian translocation]] in one of the partners leads to unviable fetuses that are miscarried. This explains why a [[karyogram]] is often performed in both partners if a woman has experienced repeated miscarriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Branch DW, Gibson M, Silver RM | title = Clinical practice. Recurrent miscarriage | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 18 | pages = 1740–7 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20979474 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcp1005330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 3% of the time a chromosomal problem of one or both partners can lead to recurrent pregnancy loss. Although patients with such a chromosomal problem are more likely to miscarry, they may also deliver normal or abnormal babies.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==== Aneuploidy ====

[[Aneuploidy]] may be a cause of a random spontaneous as well as recurrent pregnancy loss.&lt;ref name=ACOG2001&gt;{{cite journal |title=Management of Early Pregnancy Loss |journal=ACOG Practice Bulletin |volume=24 |issue=February |year=2001 |publisher=[[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aneuploidy is more common with advanced reproductive age reflecting decreased [[germ cell]] quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Angell RR | title = Aneuploidy in older women. Higher rates of aneuploidy in oocytes from older women | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 9 | issue = 7 | pages = 1199–200 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 7962415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLennan M, Crichton JH, Playfoot CJ, Adams IR | title = Oocyte development, meiosis and aneuploidy | journal = Seminars in Cell &amp; Developmental Biology | volume = 45 | pages = 68–76 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26454098 | pmc = 4828587 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcdb.2015.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endocrine disorders ===

Women with [[hypothyroidism]] are at increased risk for pregnancy losses. Unrecognized or poorly treated [[diabetes mellitus]] leads to increased miscarriages. Women with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] also have higher loss rates possibly related to hyperinsulinemia or excess androgens. Inadequate production of [[progesterone]] in the luteal phase may set the stage for RPL (see below).

=== Thrombophilia ===

An important example is the possible increased risk of miscarriage in women with [[thrombophilia]] (propensity for [[thrombosis|blood clots]]). The most common problem is the [[factor V Leiden]] and [[prothrombin G20210A]] [[mutation]].&lt;ref name=ACOG2001/&gt; Some preliminary studies suggest that [[anticoagulant]] medication may improve the chances of carrying pregnancy to term but these studies need to be confirmed before they are adopted in clinical practice.&lt;ref name="Rodger"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodger MA, Paidas M, McLintock C, Claire M, Middeldorp S, Kahn S, Martinelli I, Hague W, Rosene Montella K, Greer I | display-authors = 6 | title = Inherited thrombophilia and pregnancy complications revisited | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 112 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 320–4 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18669729 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e31817e8acc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that many women with thrombophilia go through one or more pregnancies with no difficulties, while others may have pregnancy complications. Thrombophilia may explain up to 49-65% of recurrent miscarriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nahas R, Saliba W, Elias A, Elias M | title = The Prevalence of Thrombophilia in Women With Recurrent Fetal Loss and Outcome of Anticoagulation Therapy for the Prevention of Miscarriages | journal = Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 122–128 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 27799457 | doi = 10.1177/1076029616675967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immune factors ===

A common feature of immune factors in causing recurrent pregnancy loss appears to be a decreased [[maternal immune tolerance]] towards the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams Z | title = Inducing tolerance to pregnancy | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 367 | issue = 12 | pages = 1159–61 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22992082 | pmc = 3644969 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcibr1207279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Antiphospholipid syndrome ====

The [[antiphospholipid syndrome]] is an autoimmune disease that is a common cause of recurrent pregnancy loss.&lt;ref name=RCOG-recurrent&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG)|title=The investigation and treatment of couples with recurrent first-trimester and second-trimester miscarriage|url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/GTG17recurrentmiscarriage.pdf|work=Green-top Guideline No. 17|publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG)|access-date=2 July 2013|date=April 2011|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6MGxAAe8u?url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/GTG17recurrentmiscarriage.pdf|archive-date=31 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACOG2001/&gt; Around 15% of the women who have recurrent miscarriages have high levels of antiphospholipid antibodies.&lt;ref name=RCOG-recurrent /&gt; Women who have had more than one miscarriage in the first trimester, or a miscarriage in the second trimester, may have their blood tested for antibodies, to determine if they have [[antiphospholipid syndrome]].&lt;ref name="RCOG-recurrent"/&gt; Women diagnosed with antiphospholid syndrome generally take aspirin or heparin in subsequent pregnancies, but questions remain due to the lack of high quality trials.&lt;ref name=Empson-CC&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Empson M, Lassere M, Craig J, Scott J | title = Prevention of recurrent miscarriage for women with antiphospholipid antibody or lupus anticoagulant | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD002859 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15846641 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002859.pub2 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0011643/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Patient’s Fact Sheet: Recurrent Pregnancy Lost''. American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 8/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thyroid antibodies ====

[[Anti-thyroid autoantibodies]] are associated with an increased risk of recurrent miscarriage with an [[odds ratio]] of 2.3 with a 95% [[confidence interval]] of 1.5–3.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van den Boogaard E, Vissenberg R, Land JA, van Wely M, van der Post JA, Goddijn M, Bisschop PH | display-authors = 6 | title = Significance of (sub)clinical thyroid dysfunction and thyroid autoimmunity before conception and in early pregnancy: a systematic review | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 605–19 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21622978 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmr024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Increased uterine NK cells ====

[[Natural Killer Cell]]s, a type of white blood cell, are present in uterine tissue. High levels of these cells may be linked to RPL but high numbers or the presence of these cells is not a predictor of pregnancy loss in women who have not have had a miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Christiansen | first = Ole | name-list-format = vanc | title = Recurrent pregnancy loss | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester, West Sussex, UK | year = 2014 |pages=29–37| isbn = 9781118749180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Parental HLA sharing ====

Earlier studies that perhaps paternal sharing of [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] genes would be associated with increased pregnancy loss have not been confirmed.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==== Male-specific minor histocompatibility ====

Immunization of mothers against male-specific minor histocompatibility (H-Y) antigens has a pathogenic role in many cases of ''secondary recurrent miscarriage'', that is, recurrent miscarriage in pregnancies succeeding a previous live birth. An example of this effect is that the male:female ratio of children born prior and subsequent to secondary recurrent miscarriage is 1.49 and 0.76 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nielsen HS | title = Secondary recurrent miscarriage and H-Y immunity | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 558–74 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21482560 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmr005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ovarian factors ===

&lt;!-- ====Reduced ovarian reserve====
The risk for miscarriage increases with age, and women in the advanced reproductive age who have a reduced [[ovarian reserve]] are prone to higher risk of repeated miscarriages. Such miscarriages are due to decreased egg quality. --&gt;

==== Luteal phase defect ====

The issue of a [[luteal phase defect]] is complex. The theory behind the concept suggests that an inadequate amount of [[progesterone]] is produced by the [[corpus luteum]] to maintain the early pregnancy. Assessment of this situation was traditionally carried out by an [[endometrial biopsy]], however recent studies have not confirmed that such assessment is valid.&lt;ref name=ACOG2001/&gt; Studies about the value of progesterone supplementation remain deficient, however, such supplementation is commonly carried out on an empirical basis.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Lifestyle factors ===

While lifestyle factors have been associated with increased risk for miscarriage in general, and are usually not listed as specific causes for RPL, every effort should be made to address these issues  in patients with RPL. Of specific concern are chronic exposures to toxins including [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[ethanol|alcohol]], and [[drugs]].&lt;ref name=ACOG2001/&gt;

=== Infection ===

A number of maternal infections can lead to a single pregnancy loss, including [[listeriosis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], and certain viral infections ([[rubella]], [[herpes simplex]], [[measles]], [[cytomegalo]] virus, [[Coxsackievirus|coxsackie]] virus). However, there are no confirmed studies to suggest that specific infections will lead to recurrent pregnancy loss in humans. Malaria, syphilis and brucellosis can also cause recurrent miscarriage.&lt;ref name=ACOG2001/&gt;

=== Chronic endometritis ===

Chronic Endometritis (CE) due to common bacteria has been found to be prevalent in some women with a history of recurrent miscarriage. One study found that 71 percent of women who tested positive for this condition were successfully treated by an antibiogram-based antibiotic treatment. 78.4 percent of these women subsequently became pregnant in the year following treatment. The study concludes that "CE is frequent in women with recurrent miscarriages," and that "antibiotic treatment seems to be associated with an improved reproductive outcome." The authors also conclude, "that hysteroscopy should be a part of the diagnostic workup of infertile women complaining of unexplained recurrent miscarriage."&lt;ref name=pmid24177713&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cicinelli E, Matteo M, Tinelli R, Pinto V, Marinaccio M, Indraccolo U, De Ziegler D, Resta L | display-authors = 6 | title = Chronic endometritis due to common bacteria is prevalent in women with recurrent miscarriage as confirmed by improved pregnancy outcome after antibiotic treatment | journal = Reproductive Sciences | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 640–7 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24177713 | pmc = 3984485 | doi = 10.1177/1933719113508817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment ==

Transvaginal [[ultrasonography]] has become the primary method of assessment of the health of an early pregnancy.

In non-pregnant patients who are evaluated for recurrent pregnancy loss the following tests are usually performed.
Parental chromosome testing ([[karyogram]]) is generally recommended after 2 or 3 pregnancy losses. [[Blood test]]s for [[thrombophilia]], ovarian function, [[thyroid]] function and diabetes are performed.

== Treatment ==

If the likely cause of recurrent pregnancy loss can be determined treatment is to be directed accordingly. In pregnant women with a history of recurrent miscarriage, [[anticoagulant]]s seem to increase the [[live birth rate]] among those with [[antiphospholipid syndrome]] and perhaps those with [[Thrombophilia#Congenital|congenital thrombophilia]] but not in those with unexplained recurrent miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Jong PG, Goddijn M, Middeldorp S | title = Antithrombotic therapy for pregnancy loss | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 656–73 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23766357 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that in many women with chronic endometritis, "fertility was restored after appropriate antibiotic treatment."&lt;ref name=pmid24177713/&gt;

There are currently no treatments for women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. The majority of patients are counseled to try to conceive again, and chances are about 60% that the next pregnancy is successful without treatment.&lt;ref name=ACOG2001/&gt; However, each additional loss worsens the prognostic for a successful pregnancy and increases the psychological and physical risks to the mother. Aspirin has no effect in preventing recurrent miscarriage in women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaandorp SP, Goddijn M, van der Post JA, Hutten BA, Verhoeve HR, Hamulyák K, Mol BW, Folkeringa N, Nahuis M, Papatsonis DN, Büller HR, van der Veen F, Middeldorp S | display-authors = 6 | title = Aspirin plus heparin or aspirin alone in women with recurrent miscarriage | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 362 | issue = 17 | pages = 1586–96 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20335572 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1000641 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immunotherapy]] has not been found to help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong LF, Porter TF, Scott JR | title = Immunotherapy for recurrent miscarriage | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = CD000112 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25331518 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000112.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently one drug in development, NT100, which is in clinical trials for the treatment of unexplained recurrent miscarriage. The study investigates the role of NT100 in improving maternal-fetal tolerance for women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage &lt;ref&gt;http://www.noratherapeutics.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain chromosomal situations, while treatment may not be available, in vitro fertilization with [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] may be able to identify embryos with a reduced risk of another pregnancy loss which then would be [[embryo transfer|transferred]]. However, in vitro fertilization does not improve maternal-fetal tolerance imbalances.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Close surveillance during pregnancy is generally recommended for pregnant patients with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss. Even with appropriate and correct treatment another pregnancy loss may occur as each pregnancy develops its own risks and problems.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Psychological effects of miscarriages ==
{{Main|Miscarriage and grief}}
There is significant, and often unrecognized, psychological and psychiatric trauma for the mother – for many, miscarriage represents the loss of a future child, of motherhood, and engenders doubts regarding her ability to procreate.&lt;ref&gt;Lok, I. H., &amp; Neugebauer, R. (2007). Psychological morbidity following miscarriage. Best Practice &amp; Research Clinical Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, 21(2), 229-247.&lt;/ref&gt;

"There is tremendous psychological impact of recurrent miscarriage. Psychological support in the form of frequent discussions and sympathetic counseling are crucial to the successful evaluation and treatment of the anxious couple. When no etiologic factor is identified, no treatment started at 60% to 80% fetal salvage rate still may be expected. Therefore, couples with unexplained recurrent miscarriage should be offered appropriate emotional support and reassurance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeve YB, Davies W | title = Evidence-based management of recurrent miscarriages | journal = Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 159–69 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25395740 | pmc = 4229790 | doi = 10.4103/0974-1208.142475 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association with later disease ==

Recurrent miscarriage in itself is associated with later development of [[coronary artery disease]] with an [[odds ratio]] of approximately 2,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oliver-Williams CT, Heydon EE, Smith GC, Wood AM | title = Miscarriage and future maternal cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Heart | volume = 99 | issue = 22 | pages = 1636–44 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23539554 | pmc = 3812894 | doi = 10.1136/heartjnl-2012-303237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; increased risk of ovarian cancer,&lt;ref name="pmid22623987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Braem MG, Onland-Moret NC, Schouten LJ, Kruitwagen RF, Lukanova A, Allen NE, Wark PA, Tjønneland A, Hansen L, Braüner CM, Overvad K, Clavel-Chapelon F, Chabbert-Buffet N, Teucher B, Floegel A, Boeing H, Trichopoulou A, Adarakis G, Plada M, Rinaldi S, Fedirko V, Romieu I, Pala V, Galasso R, Sacerdote C, Palli D, Tumino R, Bueno-de-Mesquita HB, Gram IT, Gavrilyuk O, Lund E, Sánchez MJ, Bonet C, Chirlaque MD, Larrañaga N, Gurrea AB, Quirós JR, Idahl A, Ohlson N, Lundin E, Jirström K, Butt S, Tsilidis KK, Khaw KT, Wareham N, Riboli E, Kaaks R, Peeters PH | display-authors = 6 | title = Multiple miscarriages are associated with the risk of ovarian cancer: results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition | journal = PLOS One | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = e37141 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22623987 | pmc = 3356371 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0037141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; increased risk of cardiovascular complications,&lt;ref name="pmid24905415"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kessous R, Shoham-Vardi I, Pariente G, Sergienko R, Holcberg G, Sheiner E | title = Recurrent pregnancy loss: a risk factor for long-term maternal atherosclerotic morbidity? | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 211 | issue = 4 | pages = 414.e1-11 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 24905415 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2014.05.050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an increased risk of all-cause mortality of 44%, 86%, and 150% for women with a history of 1, 2, or 3 miscarriages, respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid22954474"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coleman PK, Reardon DC, Calhoun BC | title = Reproductive history patterns and long-term mortality rates: a Danish, population-based record linkage study | journal = European Journal of Public Health | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 569–74 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 22954474 | doi = 10.1093/eurpub/cks107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Risky sexual behavior can be:

*Sex without [[condom]] use. 
*Mouth-to-genital contact. 
*Starting sexual activity at a young age. 
*Having multiple sex partners.
*Having a high-risk partner, someone who has multiple sex partners or infections.
*Anal sex. 
*Sex with a partner who has ever injected drugs.
*Engaging in [[sex work]].&lt;ref name = hl&gt; {{cite web |title= High Risk Sexual Behaviour | publisher = British Columbia, HealthLinkBC | | date = May 27, 2016 | access-date = April 21, 2017 | number =  | url = https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/tw9064}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Risky sexual behavior includes unprotected intercourse, [[multiple sex partners]], and illicit drug use.&lt;ref name="PandorKaltenthaler2015"/&gt; The use of alcohol and illicit drugs greatly increases the risk of [[gonorrhea]], [[chlamydia]], [[trichomoniasis]], [[hepatitis B]], and [[HIV/AIDS]]. Trauma from penile-anal sex has been identified as a risky sexual behavior.&lt;ref name = Potter2013/&gt;           

North American adolescents can be sexually active yet do not take appropriate precautions to prevent infection or pregnancies. Misconceptions of invulnerability and the practice of ignoring long-term consequences of their behavior tend to promote risky sexual behavior. Risky sexual behaviors can lead to serious consequences both for person and their partner(s). This sometimes includes [[cervical cancer]], [[ectopic pregnancy]] and [[infertility]].&lt;ref name="medscape"/&gt; An association exists between those with a higher incidence of body art ([[body piercing]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Body piercing|s]] and [[tattoo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Tattoo|s]]) and risky sexual behavior.&lt;ref name = Potter2013 &gt;{{cite book | last = Potter | first = Patricia | title = Fundamentals of nursing | publisher = Mosby Elsevier | location = St. Louis, Mo | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780323079334 | page=386 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Most Canadian and American adolescents aged 15 to 19 years describe having had sexual intercourse at least one time. In the same population, 23.9% and 45.5% of young, adolescent females describe having sex with two or more sexual partners during the previous year. Of the males in the same population 32.1% of Canadian males had two or more partners and 50.8% of American males also describe a similar experience.&lt;ref name="medscape"/&gt;

==Interventions==
Several factors linked to risky sexual behaviors – inconsistent condom use, alcohol use, polysubstance abuse, depression, lack of social support, recent incarceration, residing with a partner, and exposure to intimate partner violence and childhood sexual abuse – may represent appropriate intervention points to prevent subsequent risky sexual  behavior; however, further research is needed to establish the exact causal relationship between these factors and risky sexual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Engstrom, M, Winham, KM, &amp; Gilbert, L. Types and characteristics of childhood sexual abuse: How do they matter in HIV sexual risk behaviors among women in methadone treatment in New York City? Substance Use &amp; Misuse, 2016; 51:3, 277-294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icard LD, Jemmott,John B., I.,II, Teitelman A, O’Leary A, Heeren GA. Mediation effects of problem drinking and marijuana use on HIV sexual risk behaviors among childhood sexually abused South African heterosexual men. Child Abuse &amp; Neglect, 2014; 38(2): 234-242&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual health risk reduction can include motivational exercises, assertiveness skills, educational and behavioral interventions. Counseling has been developed and implemented for people with severe mental illness, may improve participants' knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors or practices (including assertiveness skills) and could lead to a reduction in risky sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="PandorKaltenthaler2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PandorKaltenthaler2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pandor|first1=Abdullah|last2=Kaltenthaler|first2=Eva|last3=Higgins|first3=Agnes|last4=Lorimer|first4=Karen|last5=Smith|first5=Shubulade|last6=Wylie|first6=Kevan|last7=Wong|first7=Ruth|title=Sexual health risk reduction interventions for people with severe mental illness: a systematic review|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=15|issue=1|year=2015|issn=1471-2458|doi=10.1186/s12889-015-1448-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seleni Institute''' is a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to women's physical and mental health, focusing on enhancing the quality of maternal and reproductive mental health.&lt;ref name="jhelping"/&gt; Founded in 2011 by [[psychotherapist]] Nitzia Logothetis and her husband [[George Logothetis]],&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt; it is headquartered in [[Manhattan, New York]]. The institute provides health care and information to women, trains professionals, and supports a variety of initiatives and research programs.

According to the institute's website, its aim is "to destigmatize and transform mental health and wellness by addressing real-life issues that challenge the emotional health of women, men, and their families, including: pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, infertility/third-party reproduction, miscarriage, stillbirth, menopause, parenting, and child loss."&lt;ref name=about&gt;[https://www.seleni.org/about Seleni – About Us]. ''Seleni.org''. Retrieved November 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities include treating patients; training professionals such as psychologists, therapists, [[OB/GYN]]s, pediatricians, nurses, and midwives; providing public programs such as new-parent groups, breastfeeding clinics, and adolescent services; and advocating in public and private sectors.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=pt&gt;[https://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/the-seleni-institute Seleni Institute] profile at ''[[Psychology Today]]''. Retrieved December 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the Institute inaugurated the Seleni Research Award to fund research on [[Prenatal and perinatal psychology|perinatal mood and anxiety disorders]],&lt;ref name="cvespoli" /&gt; and the following year the same grant was given out in collaboration with the [[David Lynch Foundation]].&lt;ref name="mperinatal" /&gt; In 2015 the institution began extending services to pregnant and [[post-partum]] teenage girls.&lt;ref name="fseleniinstitute" /&gt;

==History==
The Seleni Institute was founded as a nonprofit institution by [[psychotherapist]] Nitzia Logothetis and her husband [[George Logothetis]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt; The name was chosen as a portmanteau of the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] [[Selene]], who is associated with women, emotions, and serenity, and the main character in the book [[Nicholas Gage|''Eleni'']],&lt;ref name="i100conference"/&gt; who in the [[Greek Civil War]] fought for her children to escape to America.&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt; The institute's headquarters opened in [[Manhattan, New York]],&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt; with Christiane Manzella appointed clinical director.&lt;ref name="btimemagazine"/&gt;

The Seleni Institute focuses on women's [[maternal health|maternal]] and reproductive [[mental health]],&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt; providing direct care and also funding related research.&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt; The organization also provides services such as [[grief counseling]],&lt;ref name="btimemagazine"/&gt; various health workshops,&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt; and free support groups for new mothers.&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt; The institute publishes free research material and accessible write-ups on health care issues on their website,&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt; and employs a staff of writers and advisors.&lt;ref name="jhelping"/&gt; Journalist Kate Rope is editorial director as of late 2014.&lt;ref name="knyblogs"/&gt;

In February 2014, the Seleni Institute was awarded the [[Archbishop Iakovos of America|Archbishop Iakovos Leadership 100 Award for Excellence]]&lt;ref name="darchibship"/&gt; for "innovative work in creating a new modality for the treatment of women and their families."&lt;ref name="i100conference"/&gt; US Representative [[Nancy Pelosi]] officially visited and toured the institute in September 2014,&lt;ref name="hnewmagazine"/&gt; and also that year the facilities were visited by [[Laura Bush]].&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt; [[Bal des débutantes|The Bal]], a couture party held since 1992 at the [[Hôtel de Crillon]], fundraised for the Seleni Institute in 2015.&lt;ref name="llebal"/&gt;

The institute inaugurated the Seleni Research Award in 2014, which is an annual grant to fund research "on [[Prenatal and perinatal psychology|perinatal mood and anxiety disorders]]." The first grant went to Dr. Katharine Sharkey at [[Brown University]] to study the effects of sleep and light therapy on anxiety.&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt; The following year Seleni Institute partnered with the [[David Lynch Foundation]] on the same grant to create the Perinatal Mental Health Research Award, in support of research on [[transcendental meditation]] in treating perinatal anxiety.&lt;ref name="mperinatal"/&gt;

Prior to 2015 the institute held small training sessions on [[postpartum depression]];&lt;ref name="aswjseleni"/&gt; in January 2015 New York State instated new maternal-depression screening legislation, and the Seleni Institute subsequently trained 67 nurses, social workers, and health providers to identify the condition and learn about related services.&lt;ref name="aswjseleni"/&gt; In May 2015 the institute launched its Seleni Institute Teen Initiative (SITI), which extends "reproductive and maternal mental health services to pregnant and postpartum teenage girls."&lt;ref name="fseleniinstitute"/&gt;

As of 2015 the center provided care for around 300 women a week.&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt; While most clients were seen through the center in Manhattan, Seleni clinicians also interact with clients over [[Skype]].&lt;ref name="cvespoli"/&gt;

In June 2015 the institute hosted the Seleni Congressional Luncheon in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref name="ljuenfoxdc"/&gt; During the event the institute presented [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Sylvia Burwell]] and Congresswoman [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] with the [[Winnifred Mason Huck]] Leadership Award for their joint roles as mothers and as leaders in public service.&lt;ref name="kseleniretuers"/&gt;

==Life and career==
In 1931, he graduated from the Law School of Tokyo Imperial University, and in 1935 became employed by Hiroshima Municipality.

The circumstances of his rise to prominence result from the fact that following the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear bombing of Hiroshima]], many municipal employees were killed or incapacitated, while Hamai was only slightly injured. At the time of the explosion, he was at his house located about 3.5&amp;nbsp;km from the epicenter. His house was partly damaged, but he was still able to walk.&lt;ref&gt;Hamai, ''A-Bomb Mayor'', pp. 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately began relief work in cooperation with Japanese army authorities.

==Mayor of Hiroshima==
In October 1945, [[Shichirō Kihara]] was appointed the next Mayor of Hiroshima, and in December Hamai became his deputy. Following Kihara's dismissal from his duties in March 1947 by the Allied occupation authorities and the reforms conducted in Japan by General McArthur, first mayoral elections were held in Hiroshima in April 1947. In that election, Hamai ran against five other candidates, which included vice mayor Hisao Yamamoto and city council chairman Tsukasa Nitoguri. He won the election and became the first popularly elected mayor of Hiroshima.&lt;ref&gt;''A-Bomb Mayor'', pp. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

As mayor of Hiroshima, he worked to rebuild his city as symbol for [[peace]]. As part of these efforts, he established a traditional annual speech delivered at the main memorial ceremony on August 6, known as [[Peace Declaration]]. The decision to that effect was to turn the anniversary into a festival of peace. He managed to get the support of the US occupation forces to that policy, as they hoped this would reduce criticism of the US government among the people of Hiroshima. In early 1948, several citizens' groups in Hiroshima were formed in order to convince the Japanese government to release former military land for civilian purposes, and together with Hamai decided to work for the enactment of a special legislation regarding the status of Hiroshima.&lt;ref&gt;''A-Bomb Mayor'', p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve that end, Hamai made numerous trips to the Japanese Diet in Tokyo along with his secretary Chimata Fujimoto and city council chairman Tsukasa Nitoguri. Following the parliamentary election of January 1949, he got the support of the ruling [[Liberal Party (Japan, 1945)|Liberal Party]] under [[Shigeru Yoshida]] for the initiative. These efforts led to the proclamation of Hiroshima as a city of peace under [[Japanese law]]. The law to that effect was passed in the Lower House on May 10, 1949, and in the Upper House to following day. In order for the law to become effective, it required approval by municipal referendum, which was held on July 7 ended with approval of the new law.&lt;ref&gt;''A-Bomb Mayor'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; The law went into effect on August 6, 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.hiroshima.lg.jp/www/contents/0000000000000/1122608826994/html/common/other/4c3a75e1014.pdf Text of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law (from Hiroshima municipality website)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Hamai worked to establish ties with foreign peace activists, such as [[Norman Cousins]], who first visited Hiroshima in 1949. In June 1950 Hamai attended a conference in [[Caux, Switzerland]], held by the [[Moral Re-Armament|Movement for Moral Re-Armament]] established by [[Frank N. D. Buchman]]. This was his first trip abroad as a mayor.

As part of his efforts to rebuild Hiroshima as a city of peace, he used the services of architect [[Kenzo Tange]] to build a monument to the victims in Hijiyama park, now officially named peace park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/mediacenter/article.php?story=20090115140244210_en Contents of letters written by Peace Park designer Kenzo Tange disclosed]&lt;/ref&gt;  One venue of action taken by him was receiving monetary contributions for the reconstruction of his city. One such major source has been residents of [[Hawaii]], especially of Japanese origin.&lt;ref&gt;''A-Bomb Mayor'', pp. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;  He opposed the establishment by the US Army of the [[Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission]] and tried to prevent the location of its facilities in Hijiyama park, but did not succeed in that.&lt;ref&gt;''A-Bomb Mayor'', pp. 113-118&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a hibakusha himself, Hamai did express in early 1955 some support for the notion of establishing nuclear power plants in Hiroshima.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanfocus.org/-Ran-Zwigenberg/3685/article.html Ran Zwigenberg, '“The Coming of a Second Sun”: The 1956 Atoms for Peace Exhibit in Hiroshima and Japan’s Embrace of Nuclear Power,' ''The Asia-Pacific Journal'', vol. 10, Issue 6 No. 1, February 6, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mayoral election of April 1955, Hamai's popularity was in decline as rumors spread he was under investigation for financial irregularities. On April 28, just two days prior to election day, he was summoned for questioning by the Prosecutor's office, which probably led to his defeat at the polls. The charges were later dropped.&lt;ref&gt;''A-Bomb Mayor'', pp. 198-199&lt;/ref&gt; He was defeated by mayoral candidate [[Tadao Watanabe]], who became the mayor until 1959.

In April 1959 Hamai was reelected as mayor and served in that position until 1967. During this term, he had the opportunity to establish the first sister-city relations with another city, which was the city of Honolulu, Hawaii. These relations were established due to the large percentage of Hiroshima immigrants in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;''A-Bomb Mayor'', pp. 215-217&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 1966 and early 1967 he was at odds with the Japanese government over the preservation of the [[Atomic Bomb Dome]], which the government in Tokyo refused to finance. He put pressure on the government by holding a fund-raising campaign in the streets of Tokyo, which led to the donation of 60 million Yen to that cause.&lt;ref&gt;''A-Bomb Mayor'', p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Following retirement in 1967, he published a book of his memoirs in the Japanese language. In 2010, the book was published in English translation made by his son Junso Hamai (born 1936).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/mediacenter/article.php?story=20101104104906683_en English translation of book by late Hiroshima mayor is published]&lt;/ref&gt;  He died of a [[heart attack]] in February 1968. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900024,00.html]

==In popular culture==
Hamai has been extensively mentioned in the documentary book ''Children of the Ashes'' by [[Robert Jungk]]. One of the events mentioned in the book was a brief moment in April 1946, when he witnessed a small tree growing in Hiroshima, realizing that despite radioactivity, plants could grow. This episode is depicted in the poem "Shinzo Hamai: 1946" by [[George Bailin]], published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldbooks.net/bailin/ Selections from ''First Strike'', poems by George Bailin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129080701/http://www.oldbooks.net/bailin/ |date=2011-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{agriculture}}
'''Small-scale agriculture'''  has been practiced ever since the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. More recently it is an alternative to [[factory farming]] or more broadly, [[intensive agriculture]] or unsustainable farming methods that are prevalent in primarily [[first world]] countries. ''Environmental Health Perspectives'' has noted that "Sustainable agriculture is not merely a package of prescribed methods. More important, it is a change in mind set whereby agriculture acknowledges its dependence on a finite natural resource base--including the finite quality of fossil fuel energy that is now a critical component of conventional farming systems." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horrigan|first1=Leo|title=How Sustainable Agriculture Can Address the Environmental and Human Health Harms of Industrial Agriculture.|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=2002|issue=5|page=454|doi=10.1289/ehp.02110445 | PMC=1240832|pmid=12003747|volume=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale agriculture includes a number of [[sustainable agriculture]] practices such as:

* [[organic farming]], which may follow rules and regulations set by [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]] (IFOAM)
* [[permaculture]], which provides a [[holistic]] methodology for farm design
* [[arable land|arable land use]], arable land (from [[Latin]] ''arare'', to [[plough]] ) is a form of [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[land use]], meaning [[land (economics)|land]] that can be (and is) used for growing [[agriculture|crops]].  [[David Ricardo]] incorporated the idea of arable land into [[economic]] [[theory]].
* [[arable land|non-arable land use]]
* [[pastoral]], pastoral refers to the lifestyle of [[shepherds]] and [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]]s, moving livestock around larger areas of land according to seasons and availability of water and feed.
* rainfed agriculture
* [[biodynamic agriculture]] was developed by Rudolf Steiner, which consists of using herbal and [[homeopathic]] preparations for the cow dung/manure that is used extensively on the crops for fertilizer.
The methods of food sustainability and economics are hotly debated. This is a question between [[agricultural economics]] and the draining of the largely unaccounted [[natural capital]].

==Dietary methods==

Some dietary methods may contribute to sustainability such as [[macrobiotic]], [[vegan]], [[vegetarianism]] or restricting animal products to those produced using the above methods.

==Economic efficiency==

There are many economic advantages in farming on a small-scale land. Local farmers generate a local economy in their rural communities. An American study showed that small farms with incomes of $100,000 or less spend almost 95 percent of their farm-related expenses within their local communities. The same study took in comparison the fact that farms with incomes greater than $900,000 spend less than 20 percent of their farm-related expenses in the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chism|first1=J.W.|last2=Levins|first2=R.A.|title=Farm|journal=Minnesota Agricultural Economist|date=1994|volume=Spring 1994|issue=676}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, small-scale agriculture supports local economy.

Despite the claims of industrial farmer lobbies, large-scale farming is often less efficient than small sustainable farms. In fact, industrial single crop culture aims for a high output per worker. On the other side, small-scale farmers produce more food per acre of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gorelick|first1=Steven|last2=Norberg-Hodge|first2=Helen|title=Bringing the Food Economy Home: Local Alternatives to Global Agribusiness|date=2002|publisher=Kumarian Press (US)|url=http://www.localfutures.org/publications/online-articles/bringing-the-food-economy-home|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small-scale agriculture business model is generally oriented to sell products directly to the consumers.  [[Disintermediation]] gives the farmer the profit that would otherwise go to the wholesaler, the distributor and the supermarket.  About two thirds of the selling price would actually be lost for product [[marketing]].  Meanwhile, if farmers sell their products directly to consumers, they recover the totality of their product value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fortier|first1=Jean-Martin|title=Le jardinier maraîcher|date=2012|publisher=Écosociété|location=Canada|isbn=978-2-89719-003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A group of Damas de Rojo.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Chile]]an 'Damas de Rojo', volunteers on their local hospital and a clear example of social medicine.]]
The field of '''social medicine''' seeks to implement social care through:
# understand how social and economic conditions impact health, disease and the practice of medicine and
# foster conditions in which this understanding can lead to a healthier society.

Social medicine as a scientific field gradually began in the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent increase in poverty and disease among workers raised concerns about the effect of social processes on the health of the poor. The field of social medicine is most commonly addressed today by [[public health]] efforts to understand what are known as [[social determinants of health]].

==Scope==
The major emphasis on biomedical science in medical education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hixon|first=Allen L.|last2=Yamada|first2=Seiji|last3=Farmer|first3=Paul E.|last4=Maskarinec|first4=Gregory G.|date=2013-01-16|title=Social justice: The heart of medical education|url=http://socialmedicine.info/index.php/socialmedicine/article/view/671|journal=Social Medicine|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=161–168|issn=1557-7112}}&lt;/ref&gt; health care, and medical research has resulted into a gap with our understanding and acknowledgement of far more important social determinants of public health and individual disease: social-economic inequalities, war, illiteracy, detrimental life-styles (smoking, obesity), discrimination because of race, gender and religion. Farmer et al. (2006) gave the following explanation for this gap:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The holy grail of modern medicine remains the search for a molecular basis of disease. While the practical yield of such circumscribed inquiry has been enormous, exclusive focus on molecular-level phenomena has contributed to the increasing "desocialization" of scientific inquiry: a tendency to ask only biological questions about what are in fact biosocial phenomena.'''

They further concluded that ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Biosocial understandings of medical phenomena are urgently needed'''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farmer, Paul, Bruce Nizeye, Sarah Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee|first=|year=2006|title=Structural violence and clinical medicine|pmc=1621099|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=v.3(10): e449|page=e449|via=|pmid=17076568|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social care==
Social care traditionally takes a different look at issues of impairment and disability by adopting a holistic perspective on health. The social model was developed as a direct response to the medical model, the social model sees barriers (physical, attitudinal and behavioural) not just as a biomedical issue, but as caused in part by the society we live in – as a product of the physical, organizational and social worlds that lead to discrimination (Oliver 1996; French 1993; Oliver and Barnes 1993). Social care advocates equality of opportunities for vulnerable sections of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kieran Walshe|author2=Judith Smith|title=Healthcare Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TRFBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA261|date=1 September 2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=978-0-335-24382-2|pages=261+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
German physician [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821–1902) laid foundations for this model. Other prominent figures in the history of social medicine, beginning from the 20th century, include [[Salvador Allende]], [[Henry E. Sigerist]], [[Thomas McKeown (physician)|Thomas McKeown]],&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Social Medicine|last=McKeown, Thomas and Lowe, C.R.|first=|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|year=1966|isbn=|location=Oxford and Edinburgh|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor W.

In 1976, the British public health scientist and health care critic, [[Thomas McKeown (physician)|Thomas McKeown]], MD, published [http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/publications/role-medicine-dream-mirage-or-nemesis The role of medicine: Dream, mirage or nemesis?], wherein he summarized facts and arguments that supported what became known as the McKeown's thesis, i.e. that the growth of population can be attributed to a decline in mortality from infectious diseases, primarily thanks to better nutrition, later also to better hygiene, and only marginally and late to medical interventions such as antibiotics and vaccines.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/publications/role-medicine-dream-mirage-or-nemesis|title=The Role of Medicine: Dream, Mirage or Nemesis?

'''''White Hotel''''' is a [[documentary film]] produced by [[United States|American]] filmmakers Dianne Griffin and Tobi Solvang. It was shot in [[Eritrea]]. The film focuses on the issue of [[HIV/AIDS]] infection in Eritrea.

The "White Hotel" is the tourist residence where Griffin and Solvang begin their journey in Eritrea. [[UNAFF]], 
‘White Hotel’

When two women with a video camera follow an American HIV research team to Eritrea, Africa, they are seduced by a land of joy and repression, of sensuality and sexual mutilation. White Hotel is the tourist residence where Griffin and Solvang begin their journey but their journalistic objectivity is shattered by the circumstances they encounter turning their documentary into an intimate investigation of their own capacities to love, suffer and forgive.

''White Hotel'' was picked up for distribution by Jane Balfour Films in 2003. It was released on [[VHS]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/White-Hotel-VHS-Dianne-Griffin/dp/6305610363, Amazon.com listing, retrieved April 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
