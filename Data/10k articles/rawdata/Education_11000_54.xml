'''''Academic Ranking of World Universities''''' ('''''ARWU'''''), also known as '''Shanghai Ranking''', is one of the annual publications of world [[university ranking]]s. The league table was originally compiled and issued by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] in 2003, making it the first global university ranking with multifarious indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S2212567115008382/1-s2.0-S2212567115008382-main.pdf?_tid=bacd8eb9-cf02-4d15-8404-6e9c5d1c167c&amp;acdnat=1529172723_8c087a194dd1a0ef18ff22ca5a20a105|title=Global university rankings - a comparative analysis|last=Pavel|first=Adina-Petruta|date=|website=ScienceDirect|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theguardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/sep/10/university-rankings-influence-government-policy|title=World university rankings: how much influence do they really have?|publisher=The Guardian|date=2013|accessdate=27 January 2015|quote=The first international rankings, the Academic Ranking of World Universities or Shanghai Rankings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas in the case of the other rankings the results are adjusted to take account of the size of institutions, hardly any such adjustment is made by ARWU. So there is a distortion in favour of large institutions. If two institutions were to merge, the very fact of merger would mean that the merged institution would do nearly twice as well as either of the individual institutions prior to merger, although nothing else had changed.|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reception====
ARWU is praised by several media and institutions for its methodology and influence. A survey on higher education published by ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2005 commented ARWU as "the most widely used annual ranking of the world's research universities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rss.economist.com/node/4340005|title=A world of opportunity|publisher=''The Economics''|date=8 September 2005|accessdate=30 January 2015|quote=It is no accident that the most widely used annual ranking of the world's research universities, the Shanghai index, is produced by a Chinese university.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120718153816/http://rss.economist.com/node/4340005|archivedate=18 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' called ARWU "the best-known and most influential global ranking of universities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/International-Group-Announces/124882/|title=International Group Announces Audit of University Rankings|publisher=''The Chronicle of Higher Education''|date=10 October 2010|accessdate=30 January 2015|quote= ...Shanghai Jiao Tong University, which produces the best-known and most influential global ranking of universities...}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU Research Headlines reported the ARWU's work on 31 December 2003: "The universities were carefully evaluated using several indicators of research performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=European Research Headlines|title=Chinese study ranks world's top 500 universities|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/headlines/news/article_03_12_31_en.html|date=2003|accessdate=4 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109004500/http://ec.europa.eu/research/headlines/news/article_03_12_31_en.html|archive-date=2015-01-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chancellor of [[University of Oxford]], Chris Patten and former Vice-Chancellor of [[Australian National University]], Ian Chubb, said: "the methodology looks fairly solid ... it looks like a pretty good stab at a fair comparison." and "The SJTU rankings were reported quickly and widely around the world… (and they) offer an important comparative view of research performance and reputation." respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCdfZMxf8usC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Chris+Patten+ARWU&amp;ots=aMsoH0hjQX&amp;sig=meJ1pOwXCLWP3O_O1N8CwLWke9Y&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;ei=qKLLVKD9CIG0mwWI44GQDg&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA&amp;q=Chris%20Patten%20ARWU|title=Rankings and Accountability in Higher Education: Uses and Misuses|publisher=United Nations Educational|date=2013|accessdate=30 January 2015|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip G. Altbach named ARWU's 'consistency, clarity of purpose, and transparency' as significant strengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2010/11/11/altbach|title=The State of the Rankings|author=Philip G. Altbach|publisher=INSIDE HIGHER ED|date=11 September 2010|accessdate=30 January 2015|quote=Nonetheless, AWRU's consistency, clarity of purpose, and transparency are significant advantages.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ARWU has originated in China, the ranking have been praised for being unbiased towards Asian institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Academic Ranking of World Universities 2013 released|url = https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/academic-ranking-of-world-universities-2013-released/2006515.article|website = Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism====
The ranking is condemned for "relying too much on award factors" thus undermining the importance of quality of instruction and [[humanities]].&lt;ref name="thetelegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9584155/University-rankings-which-world-university-rankings-should-we-trust.html|title=University rankings: which world university rankings should we trust?|date=2015|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=27 January 2015|quote=It is a remarkably stable list, relying on long-term factors such as the number of Nobel Prize-winners a university has produced, and number of articles published in Nature and Science journals. But with this narrow focus comes drawbacks. China's priority was for its universities to 'catch up' on hard scientific research. So if you're looking for raw research power, it's the list for you. If you're a humanities student, or more interested in teaching quality? Not so much.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edmont"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Business%20School%20Prestige.pdf |title=Business School Prestige: Research versus Teaching |author=J.

Billaut, D. Bouyssou and Ph. Vincke analyse how the ARWU works, using their insights as specialists of [[Multiple-criteria decision analysis|Multiple Criteria Decision Making]] (MCDM). Their main conclusions are that the criteria used are not relevant; that the aggregation methodology has a number of major problems; and that insufficient attention has been paid to fundamental choices of criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00388319/fr/|title=Should you believe in the Shanghai ranking?|author=Jean-Charles Billaut, Denis Bouyssou &amp; Philippe Vincke|date=|accessdate=30 January 2015|publisher=CCSD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ARWU researchers themselves, N.C Liu and Y Cheng, think that the quality of universities cannot be precisely measured by mere numbers and any ranking must be controversial. They suggest that university and college rankings should be used with caution and their methodologies must be understood clearly before reporting or using the results. ARWU has been criticised by the European Commission as well as some EU member states for "favour[ing] Anglo-Saxon higher education institutions". For instance, ARWU is repeatedly criticised in France, where it triggers an annual controversy, focusing on its ill-adapted character to the French academic system&lt;ref name=EU2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ljpol.com/shanghai-academic-ranking-a-french-controversy/|title="Shanghai Academic Ranking: a French Controversy" by Marc Goetzmann, for '&amp;#39;La Jeune Politique'&amp;#39; |publisher=Lajeunepolitique.com |date=29 August 2013|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spongenberg |first=Helena |url=http://euobserver.com/881/29189 |title=EUobserver / EU to test new university ranking in 2010 |publisher=Euobserver.com |date=5 June 2014|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the unreasonable weight given to research often performed decades ago.&lt;ref name=lemonde&gt;{{cite web|last=Dagorn|first=Gary |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2016/08/16/universites-le-classement-de-shanghai-fortement-discute_4983511_4355770.html |title=Universités : pourquoi le classement de Shanghaï n’est pas un exercice sérieux |publisher=lemonde.fr |date=16 August 2016|accessdate=17 August 2016|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also criticised in France for its use as a motivation for fusing universities into larger ones.&lt;ref name=diplo&gt;{{cite web|last=Gérand|first=Christelle|url=https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2016/09/GERAND/56207|title=Aix-Marseille, laboratoire de la fusion des universités|date=September 2016|access-date=8 September 2016|publisher=www.monde-diplomatique.fr|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a further criticism has been that the metrics used are not independent of university size, e.g. number of publications or award winners will mechanically add as universities are grouped, independently of research (or teaching) quality; thus a merger between two equally-ranked institutions will almost double the merged institutions score and give it a higher ranking, without any change in quality.&lt;ref name=HEPI/&gt;

===Alternative===
As it may take much time for rising universities to produce Nobel laureates and Fields Medalists with numbers comparable to those of older institutions, the Institute created alternative rankings excluding such award factors so as to provide another way of comparisons of academic performance. The weighting of all the other factors remains unchanged, thus the grand total of 70%.

===Subject===
There are two categories in ARWU's disciplinary rankings, broad subject fields and specific subjects. The methodology is similar to that adopted in the overall table, including award factors, paper citation, and the number of highly cited scholars.

'''Adaptive performance''' in the work environment refers to adjusting to and understanding change in the [[workplace]].&lt;ref name=pulakos2000&gt;Pulakos, E. D., Arad, S., Donovan, M. A., &amp; Plamondon, K. E. (2000). Adaptability in the workplace: development of a [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of adaptive performance. Journal of Applied Psychology, 85(4), 612-624.&lt;/ref&gt;   An [[employee]] who is versatile is valued and important in the success of an organization. [[Employers]] seek employees with high [[adaptability]], due to the positive outcomes that follow, such as excellent [[Job performance|work performance]], work attitude, and ability to handle [[stress (psychological)|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;Leiz, Niessan, Swarowsky. "Age and adaptation to changes in the workplace". Journal of Managerial Psychology.  2009, p. 356-383.&lt;/ref&gt;  Employees, who display high adaptive performance in an organization, tend to have more advantages in career opportunities unlike employees who are not adaptable to change.&lt;ref name=pulakos2000 /&gt;   In previous literature, Pulakos and colleagues&lt;ref name=pulakos2000 /&gt; established eight dimensions of adaptive performance.

== Dimensions ==

Pulakos et al.&lt;ref name=pulakos2000 /&gt; proposed the following dimensions for adaptive performance: 
*'''Handling emergencies and crisis situations''': making quick decisions when faced with an [[emergency]].
*'''Handling stress in the workforce''': keeping composed and focused on task at hand when dealing with high demand tasks
*'''Creative problem solving''': thinking outside the boundary limits, and innovatively to solve a problem.
*'''Dealing with uncertain and unpredictable work situations''': able to become productive despite the occurrence of unknown situations.
*'''Learning and manipulating new technology, task, and procedures''': approach new methods and technological constructs in order to accomplish a work task.
*'''Demonstrating interpersonal adaptability''': being considerate of other people's points of view when working in a team to accomplish a certain goal.
*'''Demonstrating cultural adaptability''': being [[Diversity (business)|respectful and considerate of different cultural backgrounds]].
*'''Demonstrating physically oriented adaptability''': physically adjusting one's self to better fit the surrounding environment.

== Measurement==
Pulakos et al.&lt;ref name=pulakos2000 /&gt; developed a scale for adaptive performance based on their eight-dimension model. This scale, the Job Adaptability Inventory (JAI), contains 132 questions (15 – 18 questions per dimension).
Another similar tool is the I-ADAPT measure (I-ADAPT-M) developed by Ployhart and Bliese,&lt;ref name=ployhart2006&gt;Ployhart, Robert E.; Bliese, Paul D. Burke, C. Shawn (Ed); Pierce, Linda G. (Ed); Salas, Eduardo (Ed), (2006). ''Understanding adaptability: A prerequisite for effective performance within complex environments. Advances in human performance and cognitive engineering research'' (Vol 6)., (pp. 3-39).  Amsterdam, Netherlands: Elsevier, xi, 287 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; based on their I-ADAPT theory. They focused on [[adaptability]] as a personality-like trait which describes individual's ability to adapt to organizational changes. Therefore, there is a difference between I-ADAPT-M and the JAI which measures adaptive performance as behaviors. The I-ADAPT-M also has eight [[dimension]]s (crisis adaptability, stress adaptability, creative adaptability, uncertain adaptability, learning adaptability, interpersonal adaptability, cultural adaptability, and physical adaptability), with 5 items for every [[dimension]].

== Work stress ==
[[stress (psychological)|Work stress]] has been considered as a major factor of many work outcomes, like [[Work performance|performance]], nonproductive behavior and [[turnover (employment)|turnover]].&lt;ref&gt;Agolla, J., &amp; Ongori, H. (2008). Occupational stress in organizations and its effects on organizational performance. ''Journal of Management Research, 8''(3), 123-135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rajkumar, S., &amp; Swaminathan, R. (2013). Stress levels in organizations and their impact on employee's behavior. ''BVIMR Management Edge, 6''(1), 79-88.&lt;/ref&gt;  An employee being able to adapt to change within an organization is more focused, and able to deal with stressful situations.&lt;ref name=pulakos2000 /&gt;  An employee who is unable to absolve their strain is unable to focus on what is occurring in the [[organization]], such as [[organizational change]].&lt;ref name=folkman1986&gt;Folkman, S., Lazarus, R. S., Dunkel-Schetter, C., DeLongis, A., &amp; Gruen, R. J. (1986). Dynamics of a stressful encounter: cognitive appraisal, coping, and encounter outcomes. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50''(5), 992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only can work stress predict adaptive performance to a considerable extent, there are also a lot of overlaps between adaptive performance and [[Coping (psychology)|stress coping]].

=== Stress appraisal ===
It has been long recognized that work stress generally has a negative effects on [[job performance]],&lt;ref&gt;Motowidlo, S. J., Packard, J. S., &amp; Manning, M. R. (1986). Occupational stress: its causes and consequences for [[job performance]]. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 71''(4), 618.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is differential influence resulting from different perceptions of stressors.  When faced with a new situation, individuals would spontaneously begin to evaluate their own abilities and skills as compared with the requirements of the situation, which is referred to as stress appraisals.&lt;ref name=folkman1986 /&gt;  Such stress appraisal has two stages: primary appraisal and secondary appraisal.  In the primary appraisal stage, individuals evaluate what potential threats there will be, concerning the demands from situation and the goals and values of themselves.  In the secondary appraisal stage, individuals evaluate the resources they have to deal with those requirements.  The results of appraisal, after two stages, are indicated to fall on a continuum between two extremes of being challenged and threatened.&lt;ref&gt;Blascovich, J., &amp; Mendes, W.B. (2000). Challenge and threat appraisals: The role of affective cues. In J. Forgas (Ed.), ''Feeling and thinking: The role of affect in social cognition'' (pp. 59-82). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Challenge appraisals mean that individuals feel their resources, like abilities and social support to be abundant sufficient to fulfill requirements of the situation.  Threat appraisals, on the other hand, mean that individuals are not confident about their abilities or other resources to respond to the situation demands.  
Threat appraisals and challenge appraisals could influence [[job performance]] distinctively.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, T. R. (2004). The role of neuroticism on psychological and psychological stress responses. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,40''(6), 795-804.&lt;/ref&gt;  As for adaptive performance, the more challenging (i.e., the less threatening) one's stress appraisals are, the more adaptive performance he/she would have.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, C. K., Schneider, T. R., &amp; Lyons, J. B. (2008). Predicting Adaptive Performance in Multicultural Teams: a Causal Model. In ''NATO HFM Symposium on Adaptability in Team Coalitions, Copenhagen, Denmark''.&lt;/ref&gt;  This relationship is mediated by [[self-efficacy]], which is a belief about one's capacities for certain tasks.  Challenging rather than threatening appraisals would lead to higher levels of self-efficacy, and thus benefit individuals' adaptive performance.

=== Stress coping ===
[[Coping (psychology)|Coping]], as a form of response to [[stressors]], describes how individuals handle stressful events.  It is very close to one dimension of adaptive performance by definition (i.e., the Handling Work Stress dimension), and coping has been suggested to be another form of [[adaptation]].&lt;ref name=ployhart2006 /&gt;  However, they are still different constructions.  
[[coping (psychology)|Stress coping]] could be divided into several styles and strategies based on several theories.  One general idea is to divide coping as active coping and avoidant coping.&lt;ref&gt;Aspinwall, L. G., &amp; Taylor, S. E. (1997). A stitch in time: self-regulation and proactive [[Coping (psychology)|coping]]. ''Psychological bulletin, 121''(3), 417.&lt;/ref&gt;  Active coping means to proactively address and resolve stressful events, like quitting a stressful job and changing into a less overwhelming one.  Avoidant [[coping (psychology)|coping]] means to reduce stress by ignoring it, like involving in problematic drinking.  Another set of coping strategy types includes problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, C. S., &amp; Connor-Smith, J. (2010). Personality and coping. ''Annual Review of Psychology, 61'', 679-704.&lt;/ref&gt;  Problem-focused coping involves using skills and knowledge to deal with the cause of their problems.  Emotion-focused coping involves releasing negative emotions by ways like distracting or disclaiming.
Adaptive performance involves a mixture of different coping strategies.  Because adaptive performance concerns positive aspects of behaviors, it is more closely related to coping strategies that have positive effects, such as active coping and problem-focused coping.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, N. (2001). Stress, active coping, and academic performance among persisting and nonpersisting college students. ''Journal of Applied Biobehavioral Research, 6''(2), 65-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Struthers, C. W., Perry, R. P., &amp; Menec, V. H. (2000). An examination of the relationship among academic stress, coping, motivation, and performance in college. ''Research in higher education, 41''(5), 581-592.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, adaptive performance is more likely to contain such behaviors in stressful situations.

== Team adaptive performance ==

=== Definition ===
In addition to individual adaptive performance, psychologists are also interested in adaptive performance at team level.  Team adaptive performance is defined as an emergent phenomenon that compiles over time from the unfolding of a recursive cycle whereby one or more team members use their resources to functionally change current cognitive or behavioral goal-directed action or structures to meet expected or unexpected demands.  It is a multilevel phenomenon that emanates as team members and teams recursively display behavioral processes and draw on and update emergent cognitive states to engage in change.  Team adaptive performance is considered as the core and proximal temporal [[antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedents]] to team adaptation, which could be seen as a change in team performance in response to a salient cue or cue stream that leads to a functional outcome for the entire team.&lt;ref name=burke2006&gt;Burke, C. S., Stagl, K. C., Salas, E., Pierce, L., &amp; Kendall, D. (2006). Understanding team adaptation: a conceptual analysis and model. The Journal of Applied Psychology, 91(6), 1189–207.&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with the definition of team adaptive performance, researchers came up with a four-stage model to describe the process of team adaptive performance.  The four core constructs characterizing this adaptive cycle include: (1) situation assessment; (2) plan formulation; (3) plan execution, via adaptive interaction processes; and (4) team learning, as well as emergent cognitive states (i.e., shared mental models, team [[situational awareness]], [[psychological safety]]), which serve as both proximal outcomes and inputs to this cycle.&lt;ref name=burke2006 /&gt;
Team adaptive performance differs from individual adaptive performance from several aspects.  Team adaptive performance reflects the extent to which the team meets its objectives during a transfer performance episode, whereas individual adaptive performance reflects the extent to which each member effectively executes his or her role in the team during the transfer episode.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, G., Thomas, B., &amp; Wallace, J. C. (2005). A multilevel examination of the relationships among training outcomes, mediating regulatory processes, and adaptive performance. The Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(5), 827–41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Team adaptive performance also has different antecedents compared with individual adaptive performance.

=== Predictors ===
People have identified several dispositional and contextual factors that would affect team adaptive performance.  The most obvious and natural predictor of team adaptive performance is characteristics of team members, or [[team composition]].  Team composition with respect to members' cognitive ability is positively associated with team adaptive performance, with a moderation effect of [[goal orientation|team goals]].  Teams with difficult goals and staffed with high-performance orientation members are especially unlikely to adapt. Teams with difficult goals and staffed with high-learning orientation members are especially likely to adapt.&lt;ref&gt;LePine, J. a. (2005). Adaptation of teams in response to unforeseen change: effects of goal difficulty and team composition in terms of cognitive ability and goal orientation. The Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(6), 1153–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, team members' self-leadership, conscientiousness, and attitudes could also influence team adaptive performance.&lt;ref&gt;Hauschildt, K., &amp; Konradt, U. (2012). Self-leadership and team members' work role performance. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 27(5), 497–517.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thoms, P., Pinto, J. K., Parente, D. H., &amp; Druskat, V. U. (2002). Adaptation to Self-Managing Work Teams. Small Group Research, 33(1), 3–31.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other factors are more related to interactions between team members and team environment, like [[organisation climate|team learning climate]]).&lt;ref name=han2008&gt;Han, T. Y., &amp; Williams, K. J. (2008). Multilevel Investigation of Adaptive Performance: Individual- and Team-Level Relationships. Group &amp; Organization Management.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among them coordination of team members has been proved to be a most influential factor.  Teams' ability to adapt their coordination activities to changing situational demands is crucial to team performance.  A stronger increase in the teams' adaptive coordination was found to be related to better performance.&lt;ref&gt;Burtscher, M. J., Wacker, J., Grote, G., &amp; Manser, T. (2010). Managing Nonroutine Events in Anesthesia: The Role of Adaptive Coordination. Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, 52(2), 282–294.&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have posited that the maintenance of coordinated effort and activities ("coordination maintenance") is necessary for high team adaptive performance. This is because even with well-adapted individual performance, [[workflow]] at the team level often becomes disrupted, "overflowing" in particular directions. Overflow may create excessive work demands for some team members, while encouraging social loafing among those who are in the ebb of the workflow (see [[social loafing]]).&lt;ref&gt;Karau, S. J., &amp; Williams, K. D. (1993). Social loafing: A meta-analytic review and theoretical integration. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65(4), 681.&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that, although team members may have their own task boundaries, and individual adaptive performance may depend on each member's individual capabilities, however to the team, each employee's adaptive performance may result in successful completion of the team task only if all activities are coordinated and synchronized in a holistic fashion.  Team learning climate also displays a significant, positive relationship with team adaptive performance.&lt;ref name=han2008 /&gt;

==Leadership==
Studies show that for an individual to show [[leadership]], they must not only perform well but the individual would need to be an adaptive learner as well.&lt;ref name=hall2006&gt;Hall, D., &amp; Karaevli, A. (2006). How career variety promotes the adaptability of managers: a theoretical model. Journal of Vocational Behavior, 69(6), 359-373.&lt;/ref&gt; An individual who displays adaptive qualities and productivity in a team will most likely also display strong leadership characteristics.&lt;ref name=curnow2011&gt;Curnow, C., Fallesen, J., &amp; Glaze, H. (2011). A selective review of leadership studies in the u.s. army. MILITARY PSYCHOLOGY, 23(1), 462-478.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations value adaptive performance in the leadership characteristics an individual possess, as it has proven to help workers maintain productivity in a dynamic work environment.&lt;ref&gt;Xenikou, A., &amp; Simosi, M. (2006). Organizational culture and transformational leadership as predictors of business unit performance. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 21(6), 566-579.&lt;/ref&gt; For leaders to successfully perform their roles, they must be able to effectively address tasks and also be able to overcome social challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Halpin, S. (2011). Historical influences on the changing nature of leadership within the military environment. MILITARY PSYCHOLOGY, 23(1), 479-488.&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptive performance is a critical characteristic to have when being the leader of an organization because it aids in successfully handling any workplace situations that may arise and helping an organization progress.&lt;ref name=herman2010&gt;Herman, J., Nelson, J., &amp; Zaccaro, S. (2010). Strategic information provision and experiential variety as tools for developing adaptive leadership skills. Consulting Psychology Journal:Practice and Research, 62(2), 131-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of resisting change in the workplace, a team leader with adaptive performance establishes a new behavior appropriate to the situation to shift a potential problem into a positive outcome.&lt;ref name=mason2010&gt;Mason, C., &amp; Parker, M. (2010). Leader vision and the development of adaptive and proactive performance: a longitudinal study. Journal of Applied Psychology, 95(1), 174-182.&lt;/ref&gt; The correct type of leadership makes a positive change in the characteristics of a team's adaptability to assist in maintaining a healthy and positive workforce.&lt;ref name=hall2006 /&gt; Employees who display adaptive performance in leadership set an example for their colleagues specifically in showcasing the best way to prepare and handle adaptation in occurring organizational changes.&lt;ref name=akremi&gt;Akremi, A., Vandenberghe, C., &amp; Voirin, A. (2010). A multilevel model of transformational leadership and adaptive performance and the moderating role of climate for innovation. Group &amp; Organization Management, 35(3), 699-726.&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptive performance in leadership is valued by employers because an employee who displays those two characteristics tends to exemplify and motivate adaptive behavior within other individuals in the workforce.&lt;ref name=herman2010 /&gt;

===Transformational leadership===
In organizational situations where adaptability to the environment and difficult challenges occur often, an individual who possess [[transformational leadership]] is preferred.&lt;ref name=conchie2013&gt;Conchie, S. (2013). Transformational leadership, intrinsic motivation, and trust: a moderated-mediated model of workplace safety. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 18(2), 198-210.&lt;/ref&gt; Transformational leadership is a leadership style that encourages team members to imagine new ideas of change and to take action on these ideas to help handle certain situations.&lt;ref name=akremi /&gt; This particular leadership style is commonly used in organizations, due to its positive outcomes such as higher [[work engagement]], [[motivation]], and [[creativity]] in employees.&lt;ref name=conchie2013 /&gt; 
Parker and Mason's 2010 study introduced a relationship between transformational leadership with work adaptation and work performance.&lt;ref name=mason2010 /&gt; The study stated that transformational leadership relates to adaptive performance by having team members become creative in the different strategies that can be used when approaching a certain situation which eventually leads to a higher performance.&lt;ref name=mason2010 /&gt; Being creative and handling stressful situations the team leader as well as the team exemplifies the dimensions of adaptive performance.&lt;ref name=balthazard2013&gt;Balthazard, P., Hannah, S., Jennings, P., &amp; Waldman, D. (2013). The psychological and neurological bases of leader self-complexity and effects on adaptive decision-making. Journal of Applied Psychology,98(3), 393-411.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular leadership style has also been shown as a motivator to increase the behavior of performance and adaptability in employees.&lt;ref name=akremi /&gt;  An individual showcasing transformational leadership has the ability to encourage more adaptive and productive behavior within team members through presenting new ideas and possible outcomes in the workplace.&lt;ref name=akremi /&gt;

===Leadership and adaptive decision making===
An individual who displays leadership adaptability is one who is able to adjust their thoughts and behavior to attain appropriate responses to complex situations helping them make [[decision-making|appropriate decisions]].&lt;ref name=balthazard2013 /&gt; A leader must make decisions and be adaptable to any organizational changes in order for the team to collectively continue workplace productivity.&lt;ref name=hall2006 /&gt;  An adaptive leader makes decisions to perform a specific action to better fit the organization and help it become productive.&lt;ref name=kwantes2013&gt;Kwantes, P., Neal, A., &amp; Vuckovic, A. (2013). Adaptive decision making in a dynamic environment: a test of a sequential sampling model of relative judgment. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 19(3), 266-284.&lt;/ref&gt; By a leader displaying adaptive performance when making a decision, the team leader shows their awareness of a situation leading to new actions and strategies to reestablish fit and effectiveness.&lt;ref name=curnow2011 /&gt; Organizations value the characteristic of adaptive decision making in an individual as it displays an individual's understanding and adjusting capabilities to a difficult situation further aiding in the decision making process.&lt;ref name=kwantes2013 /&gt;

'''Johanna Mansfield Sullivan Macy''' (April 14, 1866 – October 20, 1936), better known as '''Anne Sullivan''', was an American teacher, best known for being the instructor and lifelong companion of [[Helen Keller]].&lt;ref name="Herrmann35"&gt;Herrmann, Dorothy. ''Helen Keller: A Life'', Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1998, p. 35; {{ISBN|0-679-44354-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of five, Sullivan contracted [[trachoma]], an eye disease, which left her blind and without reading or writing skills.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;McGinnity, Seymour-Ford, &amp; Andries, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; She received her education as a student of the [[Perkins School for the Blind]] where upon graduation she became a teacher to Keller when she was 20.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Childhood==
Sullivan was born on April 14, 1866, in [[Feeding Hills, Agawam, Massachusetts]]. According to her baptismal certificate, her name at birth was Johanna Mansfield Sullivan; however, she was called Anne or Annie from birth.&lt;ref name="afb.org"&gt;[http://www.afb.org/annesullivan/asmbiography.asp Anne Sullivan profile at www.afb.org]&lt;/ref&gt; She was the oldest child of Thomas and Alice (Cloesy) Sullivan. Her family emigrated to the United States from Ireland during the Great Famine.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; When she was only five years old she contracted a bacterial eye disease known as [[trachoma]], which created painful infections and over time made her nearly blind.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; When she was eight, her mother died, and her father abandoned the children two years later for fear he could not raise them on his own.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; She and her younger brother, James ("Jimmie"), were sent to an overcrowded [[almshouse]] in [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts]] (today part of [[Tewksbury Hospital]]). Jimmie had a weak hip condition and died two to three months into their stay. Sullivan remained at the Tewksbury house for four years after his death, where she had eye operations that offered some short-term relief for her eye pain but ultimately proved ineffective.&lt;ref name="afb.org" /&gt;

==Education==
[[File:1912 HoweBuilding Watertown Massachusetts byAHFolsom.png|thumb|1912 Howe Building Watertown Massachusetts by A. H. Folsom]]
Sullivan lost her sight at a young age and therefore had no skills in reading, writing, or sewing and the only work she could find was as a housemaid; however, this position was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Another blind resident staying at the Tewksbury almshouse told her of schools for the blind. During an 1880 inspection of the almshouse, she convinced inspector [[Franklin Benjamin Sanborn]] to allow her to leave and enroll in the Perkins School for the Blind in [[Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Tom Foran, ''The Significance of Being Frank: The Life and Times of Franklin Benjamin Sanborn'', Xlibris, 2015, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} where she began her studies on October 7, 1880.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Although her rough manners made her first years at Perkins humiliating for her, she managed to connect with a few teachers and made progress with her learning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; While there, she befriended and learned the [[manual alphabet]] from [[Laura Bridgman]], a graduate of Perkins and the first blind and deaf person to be educated there. Also while there, she had a series of eye operations that significantly improved her vision.&lt;ref name="afb.org" /&gt; In June 1886, she graduated at age 20 as the [[valedictorian]] of her class. She stated, "Fellow-graduates: duty bids us go forth into active life. Let us go cheerfully, hopefully, and earnestly, and set ourselves to find our especial part. When we have found it, willingly and faithfully perform it; for every obstacle we overcome, every success we achieve tends to bring man closer to God and make life more as he would have it."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

The summer following Sullivan's graduation, the director of the Perkins Institution, Michael Anagnos, was contacted by Arthur Keller, who was in search of a teacher for his seven-year-old blind and deaf daughter, [[Helen Keller|Helen]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Anagnos immediately recommended Sullivan for this position and she began her work on March 3, 1887, at the Kellers' home in [[Tuscumbia, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; As soon as she arrived there, she argued with Helen's parents about the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and over the fact that they used to own slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Kim E. Nielsen, ''The radical lives of Hellen Keller'', Year: 2007, c2004, New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However she also quickly connected with Helen. It was the beginning of a 49-year relationship: Sullivan evolved from teacher to governess and finally to companion and friend.&lt;ref name="rnib"&gt;[http://www.rnib.org.uk/aboutus/aboutsightloss/famous/Pages/helenkeller.aspx The life of Helen Keller] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231065031/http://www.rnib.org.uk/aboutus/aboutsightloss/famous/Pages/helenkeller.aspx |date=December 31, 2012 }}, [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]], last updated August 14, 2012. Retrieved December 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Helen Keller27.jpg|thumb|Sullivan (standing) with Helen Keller, circa 1909]]

Sullivan's curriculum involved a strict schedule with constant introduction of new vocabulary words, however, Sullivan quickly changed her teachings after seeing they did not suit Keller.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Instead, she began to teach her vocabulary based on her own interests, by spelling each word out into Keller's palm; within six months this method proved to be working as Keller had learned 575 words, some multiplication tables, and the [[Braille]] system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Sullivan strongly encouraged Helen's parents to send her to the Perkins School where she could have an appropriate education. Once they agreed to this, Sullivan took Keller to Boston in 1888 and stayed with her there. Sullivan continued to teach her bright protégée, who soon became famous for her remarkable progress. With the help of Anagnos, Keller became a public symbol for the school, helping to increase its funding and donations and making it the most famous and sought-after school for the blind in the country. However, an accusation of plagiarism against Keller greatly upset Sullivan: she left and never returned, but did remain influential to the school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Sullivan remained a close companion to Keller and continued to assist in her education, which ultimately included a degree from [[Radcliffe College]].

==Personal life==
[[File:Helen Keller with Anne Sullivan in July 1888.jpg|thumb|left|Helen Keller and Sullivan vacationing at [[Cape Cod]] in July 1888]]
On May 3, 1905, Sullivan married [[Harvard University]] instructor and literary critic John Albert Macy (1877–1932), who had helped Keller with her publications.&lt;ref name="Lash, 1980"&gt;Lash, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; He moved in with them, and they lived together. However, within a few years, the marriage began to disintegrate. By 1914 they separated, though he is listed as living as a "lodger" with them in the 1920 U.S. Census.&lt;ref name="1920census"&gt;In the 1920 census, Keller was 38 years old and listed as head of her household in [[Queens, New York]]. Sullivan, age 52, is listed as living with her as a private teacher. John, age 44, is also listed as living with them, as a "lodger", with the occupation of writer/author.&lt;/ref&gt; They never officially divorced. As the years progressed after their separation, he appears to have faded from her life. She never remarried.

==Awards==
In 1932 Keller and Sullivan were each awarded honorary fellowships from the [[Educational Institute of Scotland]]. They also were awarded honorary degrees from [[Temple University]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, pp. 252–53&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 Keller was awarded an [[honorary degree]] from Harvard University,&lt;ref name="Lash, 1980" /&gt;
and in 1956 the director's cottage at the Perkins School was named the Keller-Macy Cottage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

In 2003, Sullivan was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/anne-sullivan/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Anne Sullivan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Sullivan had been seriously visually impaired for almost all of her life, but by 1935 she was completely blind in both eyes. On October 15, 1936, she had a [[coronary thrombosis]], fell into a [[coma]], and died five days later on October 20&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; at age 70, in [[Forest Hills, Queens, New York]] with Keller holding her hand.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Keller described Sullivan's last month as being very agitated, but during the last week she was said to return to her normal generous self.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan was cremated and her ashes were interred in a memorial at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3rd ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 24972–24974). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle edition.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman to be recognized for her achievements in this way. When Keller died in 1968, her ashes were placed in the [[Washington National Cathedral]] next to those of Sullivan.

==Media representation==
Sullivan is the main character in ''[[The Miracle Worker (play)|The Miracle Worker]]'', by [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]], originally produced for television in 1957, where she was portrayed by [[Teresa Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0942863|Teresa Wright (I)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and was later produced as a [[The Miracle Worker (1962 film)|1962 feature film]]. Both the play and film featured [[Anne Bancroft]] as Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0000843|Anne Bancroft (I)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patty Duke]], who played Keller on Broadway and in the 1962 film version, later played Sullivan in a [[The Miracle Worker (1979 film)|1979 television remake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0001157|Patty Duke}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roma Downey]] portrayed her in the TV movie ''Monday After the Miracle'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deseretnews.com/article/663014/Roma-Downey-also-stars-in-CBS-movie-Miracle.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alison Elliott]] portrayed her in a [[The Miracle Worker (2000 film)|2000 television movie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0254362|Alison Elliott (I)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alison Pill]] played her on Broadway in the short-lived 2010 revival, with [[Abigail Breslin]] as Keller.

[[Anne Bancroft]] and [[Patty Duke]] won [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], respectively, for their roles as Sullivan and Keller in the 1962 film version ''[[The Miracle Worker]]''.

It is based in [[al-Adiliyah Madrasa]] and is modeled on the language academies of Europe and founded with the explicit reference to the example of the [[Académie française]].

[[Arabization]] was the major mission of this academy after long period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] domination and use of [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] in major parts of the [[Arab world]].

The '''Centre International de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées''' ('''CIMPA'''; in English: International Centre for Pure and Applied Mathematics) is an association under the [[1901 French law on associations]] with the mission to promote research in mathematics in developing countries. CIMPA is a category 2 [[UNESCO]] centre, based in [[Nice]] and funded by [[France]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]] and [[Switzerland]].

==History==
Following a recommendation made during the 18th session of the General Conference of UNESCO in Paris in 1974, the creation of CIMPA was decided during the 19th session of the General Conference of UNESCO in Nairobi in 1976.  On the initiative of the French Government and a group of founding members (J.P. Aubin, J. Céa, P. Deheuvels, F. Dress, C. Godbillon, [[Henri Hogbe Nlend|H. Hogbe Nlend]], [[Jacques-Louis Lions|J.L. Lions]], [[Jean-Louis Koszul|J.L. Koszul]], E.J. Picard, A. Revuz, P. Sabourin), the International Center for Pure and Applied Mathematics was formally created as an association of the law of 1901, on 30 October 1978. According to its statutes, its mission is the training of mathematicians coming in priority from developing countries, by means of study visits during the university academic year and of summer schools, and with the help of the development of means of documentations. The seat of CIMPA is fixed at Nice, and its host university is the [[University of Nice Sophia Antipolis]].

==Activities==
The organization of about 20 research schools per year in developing countries constitutes the main activity of CIMPA.  This is supplemented by other kinds of actions such as the research training schools in partnership with learned societies like the [[African Mathematical Union]] (AMU), the Mathematical Union of Latin America and the Caribbeans (UMALCA in Spanish), the South East Asian Mathematical Society (SEAMS) or the Southern Africa Mathematical Sciences Association (SAMSA).  CIMPA works equally in partnership with other organizations with similar aims such as the [[International Mathematical Union]] (IMU) or the [[Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP).

==Fundings==
The principal financial support of CIMPA comes from the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research (MESR in French), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, the laboratory of excellence CARMIN (Centre for international mathematical encounters), and the National Institute of Mathematical Sciences and their interactions (INSMI) of the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS).  Since 2009, CIMPA is also supported by the Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (MINECO, Spain), and since 2011 by the Ministry of Education and Research (Norway), and by a grant from Switzerland via the [[University of Neuchâtel]].

'''Clarion West Writers Workshop''' is an intensive six-week program for writers preparing for professional careers in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. It runs annually from late June through the end of July. The workshop is limited to 18 students per year. Each of the six weeks is instructed by a different professional writer or editor. The roster of guest instructors changes yearly. Founded in [[Seattle]], Washington in 1971, the workshop has been held continuously since 1984. Clarion West celebrated its 25th anniversary of continuous instruction in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;"Clarion West Turns 25". Locus Magazine, September 2008: Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clarion West board of directors currently includes Karen G. Anderson, Kelley Eskridge, Tod McCoy, Jeffrey Lemkin, Felicia Gonzalez, Phoebe Harris, V.N. Saunders, and Nisi Shawl.

== History ==

The 1971 Clarion West Writers Workshop was founded by [[Vonda N. McIntyre]], a [[Clarion Workshop]] graduate and [[Nebula Award|Nebula]] and [[Hugo Award]]-winning author, with the support of original Clarion founder [[Robin Scott Wilson]]. It was modeled after the original Clarion Workshop founded in 1968 at [[Clarion University of Pennsylvania]] (itself inspired by the [[Milford Writer's Workshop]]). The original Clarion Workshop was slated to close after holding final classes in 1970, and the effort was made to establish and continue Clarion workshops in other locations. The 1971 successor workshops that sprang from this effort were Clarion West Workshop founded in Seattle, and [[Clarion Workshop]] revived in New Orleans (later moved to Michigan in 1972, and San Diego in 2007). Clarion West operated until 1973, before a hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhem, Kate.  ''Storyteller: Writing Lessons and More from 27 Years of the Clarion Writers' Workshop'', Small Beer Press, Easthampton, MA 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-931520-16-4}}: Pages 32-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Clarion West graduate J.T. Stewart and Seattle writer, Marilyn J. Holt, reconvened the workshop with the support of founder [[Vonda N. McIntyre]]. Clarion West incorporated as a nonprofit organization with a board of directors in 1986 with the help of many dedicated Clarion West alumni. Currently the workshop is administered by [[Neile Graham]] and Huw Evans.  Although the workshop is located in close proximity to the [[University of Washington]], it is not associated with the university. It has operated continuously to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;About Clarion West: http://www.clarionwest.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workshop format ==

The workshop is combination of instruction and mutual student critique using the Clarion Method. The emphasis of learning is primarily geared toward hours spent reading, writing and critiquing.  Normally, students are expected to write one complete draft of a story per week, to be critiqued the following week. Ideas for these stories are up to the student, but the emphasis is that the writing takes place on premises where fresh lessons and insight can be immediately applied to new story ideas. Work on 'trunk' stories, written before the workshop, is discouraged.

The class lecture and critique runs weekdays from morning to early afternoon. The remainder of the day is typically divided between writing for the next week's story deadline, reading, and preparing critiques. The workload is intense, but breaks and socializing are typical at all hours. Weekends are free time to socialize, explore the local sights, and catch up on unfinished writing and reading.

Each student typically gets a weekly private conference with each instructor to ask questions and gain insight from that professional writer or editor.

Although the focus of the workshop is on [[speculative fiction]], such as [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]], other genres, including [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[comedy]], [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]], and [[fiction|literary]] writing (and mixtures thereof) regularly grace the workshop stories. The workshop focuses on writing and critiquing [[short story|short stories]], but many aspects of [[novel]] writing are also discussed in workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Clarion West Introductory Information for Students Handout, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extracurricular activities ==

The speculative fiction community around the Seattle area has built support for the workshop over the years, and many special events have become part of the Clarion West tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Howle, Leslie. "Twenty Five Years of Clarion West". Seventh Week, Fall 2008: Pages 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

*Clarion West Parties: These invitation-only events are attended by the students and administrators, graduated alumni, and many established writers, editors, agents, and fans in the industry.  
* Readings and Book Signings: These public events allow students and the public to experience readings by the instructing writers.  They are regularly hosted by the local [[University Book Store]].&lt;ref&gt;University Book Store : http://www.ubookstore.com/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame]]/[[Locus Award]]s weekend: frequently the workshop coincides with the yearly Locus Awards and Science Fiction Hall of Fame weekend events. This is a chance for students to participate in events that typically draw writers and professionals from around the globe.

== Traditions ==

There are a number of class traditions passed down from one class to the next in the manner of a secret society. Traditions that are publicly known include the yearly Clarion West class shirt (designed by the class and limited only to the classmates and instructors of that year),&lt;ref&gt;Example of a Clarion West class shirt, 2004: https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/343613/&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice of presenting unusual gifts to each of the instructors.  Classes often come up with new traditions and items to pass on to the next year's class.

== Applications ==

Space in the workshop is awarded to the top 18 applicants of all submissions received. The average number of applications is not disclosed and varies year to year.

The application window typically opens January 1 and runs through March 1 for the year attending. Students are usually selected and informed of acceptance by the end of March.&lt;ref&gt;Workshop Application Guidelines: http://www.clarionwest.org/workshop/apply&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Clarion West, [[Clarion Workshop|Clarion]], and Clarion South are run independently, they follow the same workshop method and are considered sister schools. Since both Clarion West and Clarion workshops run concurrently, students are often encouraged to apply to both workshops to increase their chances of attending that year. Students accepted to both programs must choose their preferred workshop. Each of the schools has similar but distinct guidelines.

Students that graduate one of the Clarion workshops are considered alumni of all the Clarion programs, and may not re-apply for any other Clarion Workshop.

The '''Collegiate Middle Level Association''' ('''CMLA''') is a student association designed to promote and support the professional development of future middle level teachers, as well as the development and nurturing of middle level education programs.  CMLA is an affiliate of [[National Middle School Association]].  Currently, [[Otterbein College]] is serving as the national host site for the organization's leadership.  Their two-year leadership term will conclude November 2011 with CMLA's annual meeting at NMSA's headquarters in Columbus, OH.

==Purpose of CMLA==

*Advance appropriate middle level education
*Provide information about starting and maintaining an organized group of students involved in middle level education on college and university campuses.
*Support standards and recommendations which enhance middle level concepts, practices and ideas.
*Publicize current middle level employment opportunities.
*Promote and invite collegiate participation at national, state and regional middle level conferences.
*Support and encourage students of middle level education, and inform members of the progress and activities of both CMLA and other student groups via newsletters, electronic technology and other sources of communication.

==Collegiate Middle Level Association: A Historical Perspective==

John Swaim,
CMLA Advisory Chair

The Collegiate Middle Level Association currently has 31 chapters. These 31 chapters represent a growing number of colleges and universities who are now preparing teachers to teach young adolescents in American's [[middle schools]]. This would have been an unthinkable dream for a handful of college students in the middle school teacher education program at the [[University of Northern Colorado]] who were trying to create a national organization for students preparing to become middle school teachers in 1988. At that time there were only 18 states that had [[middle school]] certification or endorsement as opposed to 46 states today. In 1988 middle school teacher education programs were the exception rather than the rule. Even more rare were middle school teacher education programs with active student organizations. As the decade of the 90s began there were only four higher education institutions that had active middle school student groups, [[University of Northern Colorado]], [[University of Northern Iowa]], [[Illinois State University]], and [[Appalachian State University]].

In 1989, under the leadership of Ned Gilardino, a UNC student, a constitution was drafted and the Student Association for Middle Education (SAME) was born. Its name was later changed to Collegiate Middle Level Association (CMLA). That same year CMLA made a presentation to the [[NMSA]] Board of Trustees. The Board recognized CLMA and agreed to help finance them by sharing a percentage of the membership fee of all college students who joined NMSA and had an interest in also becoming a member of CMLA. However, joining by individual membership did not provide the stability that was needed to help the association grow. In fact, when the elections were held the officers often came from several different campuses which made it difficult to conduct the business of the association.

Then, in 1995 two significant events occurred that moved CMLA to a new level. First, NMSA recognized CMLA as an official affiliate member, joining other state middle school associations. Secondly, CMLA moved from an individual membership to a chapter membership. The constitution underwent major revisions that not only changed membership from individual to chapter membership, but also changed how the association would be financed and governed. An advisory board was established consisting of the chapter advisors of all the member chapters. The officers were now elected from one campus that applied and was approved by the Advisory Board to be the host site for a two year term. Financing was more closely aligned with NMSA. The association was able to have two annual meetings rather than just meeting at the NMSA annual conference.

At first CMLA grew slowly under this newly revised structure. However, as more states legislated [[middle school]] teacher licensure and more colleges and universities began to develop middle school teacher education programs, CMLA provided an ever increasing number of prospective middle school teachers the opportunity to become professionally involved as middle level educators.

The following colleges and universities have been leadership host sites for CMLA since the new restructuring: [[Otterbein College]] (2009–Present); [[Georgia College &amp; State University]] (2007-2009); [[University of Dayton]] (2005-2007); [[Ashland University]] (2003-2005); [[Appalachian State University]] (2001-2003); [[Central Michigan University]] (1999-2001); [[Missouri Southern State University]] (1997-1999); and [[Illinois State University]] (1995-1997).

The '''Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education''' ('''CAHME''') is the [[Educational accreditation|accrediting body]] for [[Graduate school|graduate]] programs in [[Health administration|healthcare management]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It is based in [[Rockville, Maryland]] and is a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3) non-profit organization]].

Founded in 1968 as the '''Accrediting Commission on Education for Health Services Administration''' ('''ACEHSA'''), it adopted its current name in 2004 to reflect a change in strategic direction. This came after its 2001 Orlando Forum, a meeting funded by the [[Kellogg Foundation]] and the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] and called to examine management and leadership preparation practices in the U.S. [[healthcare industry]]. As a result of the meeting, a task force was appointed, with representatives of the practice and academic communities. The task force recommended changes in the accreditation process, and the name of the organization was changed.

CAHME has been granted recognition by the [[Council on Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) to accredit [[Master's degree|master's]] level-healthcare management programs in the United States.  It also accredits programs in Canada and in 2018 has expanded to accredit programs outside of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cahme.org/Background.html|title=CAHME Accredited Programs - Background&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Association of University Programs in Health Administration]] (AUPHA) requires master's programs to have CAHME accreditation before they can be considered full members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aupha.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3392|title=Masters Programs - The Association of University Programs in Health Administration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAHME works closely with its corporate members, [[Association of University Programs in Health Administration]], the American College of Healthcare Executives, the [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]] [[Healthcare Financial Management Association]], [[Ascension (company)|Ascension]], [[Cedars Sinai Medical Center]], [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society]], Medical Group Management Association, [[Hospital Corporation of America|HCA]], and the [[American Hospital Association]] to establish the standards for healthcare management education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accreditation: Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME)|url=http://www.guidetohealthcareschools.com/articles/accreditation/healthcare-accrediting-agencies#CAHME|publisher=Guide to Healthcare Schools|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Alistair Kemp''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AC}} (born 14 October 1941), Australian politician, was a [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] member of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] from March 1990 to October 2004, representing the [[Division of Goldstein]], Victoria.

==Early life and education==
Kemp was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and was educated at the [[University of Melbourne]] and [[Yale University]], where he gained a doctoral degree in politics. He is the brother of Senator [[Rod Kemp]], and the son of [[Charles Denton Kemp]], founder of the [[Institute of Public Affairs]].

==Career==
Kemp was Senior Lecturer in Political Science at the University of Melbourne 1975–79 and Professor of Politics at [[Monash University]], Melbourne 1979–90.

White) (1986), ''Current Priorities for Liberalism'' (1986) and ''Foundations for Australian Political Analysis: Politics and Authority'' (1988).

===Political career===
Kemp was Senior Adviser to [[Malcolm Fraser]], Leader of the Opposition and Prime Minister 1975–76 and Director of the Prime Minister's Office 1981.

In 1990 Kemp challenged Liberal MP and former Cabinet minister, [[Ian Macphee]], for Liberal endorsement in the safe Melbourne seat of Goldstein. Kemp was seen as the candidate of the conservative wing of the Liberal Party, against a leading moderate liberal figure. Kemp won the battle.

Kemp was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1990–96. He was Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation 1996–97.

He was [[Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Australia)|Minister for Environment and Heritage]] from November 2001 to July 2004. He was [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]] from October 1998 to July 2004. His brother Rod was a fellow minister.

David Kemp retired at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 election]].  He was succeeded as member for Goldstein by [[Andrew Robb]].

In 2007, he was elected President of the Victorian Branch of the Liberal Party.  He retired in 2011 and was replaced as Liberal state President by Tony Snell.&lt;ref

&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[speech recognition]] software package developed by Dragon Systems of [[Newton, Massachusetts]], which merged with Lernout &amp; Hauspie Speech Products and was later acquired by [[Nuance Communications]], formerly known as ScanSoft. It runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[personal computer]]s. Version 15 (Professional Individual and Legal Individual),&lt;ref name="Nuance Dragon Products"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuance.com/company/news-room/press-releases/Dragon-New-Releases-Powered-by-Deep-Learning.docx|title=Nuance Announces Major New Releases of Dragon for Windows and Mac OS X|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which supports 32-bit and 64-bit editions of [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8|8]] and [[Windows 10]], was released in August 2016.&lt;ref name="64-bit support"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuance.com/naturallyspeaking/support/vista_64bit.asp | title=Nuance product support for Microsoft Windows Vista | accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuance.co.uk/windows7/| title=Nuance product support for Microsoft Windows 7 |year=2010|accessdate = 16 Aug 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[macOS]] version is called Dragon Professional Individual for Mac, version 6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuance.com/company/news-room/press-releases/Dragon-New-Releases-Powered-by-Deep-Learning.docx|title=Nuance Announces Major New Releases of Dragon for Windows and Mac OS X|last=|first=|date=|year=2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Dragon for Mac''.

==Features==
NaturallySpeaking uses a minimal user interface. As an example, dictated words appear in a floating [[tooltip]] as they are spoken (though there is an option to suppress this display to increase speed), and when the speaker pauses, the program [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribes]] the words into the [[active window]] at the location of the cursor (Dragon does not support dictating to background windows). The software has three primary areas of functionality: voice recognition in dictation with speech transcribed as written text, recognition of spoken commands, and [[text-to-speech]]: speaking text content of a document. Voice profiles can be accessed by different computers in a networked environment, although the audio hardware and configuration must be identical to those of the machine generating the configuration. The Professional version allows creation of custom commands to control programs or functions not built into NaturallySpeaking.

==History==

[[James K. Baker|Dr. James Baker]] laid out the description of a speech understanding system called DRAGON in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Baker
 | first = James K.
 | title = The DRAGON System - An Overview
 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing
 | volume = 23
 | issue = 1
 | pages = 24–29
 | year = 1975 
 | doi = 10.1109/TASSP.1975.1162650 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1982 he and Dr. [[Janet M. Baker]], his wife, founded [[Dragon Systems]] to release products centered around their voice recognition prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragon-medical-transcription.com/history_speech_recognition.html | title=History of Speech Recognition and Transcription Software |accessdate =2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was President of the company and she was CEO.

[[DragonDictate]] was first released for [[DOS]], and utilized [[hidden Markov models]], a probabilistic method for temporal [[pattern recognition]]. At the time, the hardware was not powerful enough to address the problem of [[word segmentation]], and DragonDictate was unable to determine the boundaries of words during continuous speech input. Users were forced to enunciate one word at a time, each clearly separated by a small pause. DragonDictate was based on a [[trigram]] model, and is known as a discrete utterance speech recognition engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/a2x-voice/dd-faq.html#What | title=DragonDictate product information |accessdate = 2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dragon Systems released NaturallySpeaking 1.0 as their first continuous dictation product in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragon-medical-transcription.com/history_speech_recognition.html | title=Dragon NaturallySpeaking 1.0 released |accessdate =2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joel Gould was the director of emerging technologies at Dragon Systems. Gould was the principal architect and lead engineer for the development of Dragon NaturallyOrganized (1.0), Dragon NaturallySpeaking Mobile Organizer (3.52), Dragon NaturallySpeaking (1.0 through 2.02), and DragonDictate for Windows (1.0). Gould also designed the tutorials in both DragonDictate for DOS version 2.0 and Dragon Talk.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The company was then purchased in June 2000 by [[Lernout &amp; Hauspie]], a Belgium-based corporation that had been involved in financial scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/07/business/dragon-systems-sputters-after-belgian-suitor-fails.html?pagewanted=all | title=Dragon Systems purchased by Lernout &amp; Hauspie | accessdate=2010-02-03 |date=2001-05-07 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the all-share deal advised by [[Goldman Sachs]], Lernout &amp; Hauspie declared bankruptcy in November 2000. The Bakers had received stock worth hundreds of millions of US dollars, but were only able to sell a few million dollars' worth before the stock lost all its value as a result of the accounting fraud. The Bakers sued Goldman Sachs for negligence, intentional misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty, which in January 2013 led to a 23-day trial in Boston. The jury cleared Goldman Sachs of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/business/goldman-sachs-cleared-in-collapse-of-dragon-systems-sale.html?ref=business | title=Goldman Is Cleared Over a Sale Gone Awry | accessdate=2013-01-23 |date=2013-01-23 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the bankruptcy of Lernout &amp; Hauspie, the rights to the Dragon product line were acquired by [[ScanSoft]] of [[Burlington, Massachusetts]]. In 2005 ScanSoft launched a ''de facto'' acquisition of [[Nuance Communications]], and rebranded itself as [[Nuance Communications|Nuance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuance.com/news/pressreleases/2005/20050509_nuance.asp | title=ScanSoft and Nuance to Merge | accessdate = 2010-02-03 |date=2005-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012 [[LG Smart TV]]s include voice recognition feature powered by the same speech engine as Dragon NaturallySpeaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/02/who-s-the-third-party-that-samsung-and-lg-smart-tvs-are-sharing-your-voice-data-with/index.htm |title=Samsung and LG smart TVs share your voice data behind the fine print |publisher=ConsumerReports |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enrico Cecchetti''' ({{IPA-it|enˈriːko tʃekˈketti}}; 21 June 1850 in Rome &amp;ndash; 13 November 1928 in [[Milan]]) was an Italian [[ballet]] dancer, [[mime]], and founder of the [[Cecchetti method]].&lt;ref name="Dance Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Barringer | first = Janice | title = Cecchetti's choices. (Technique) Enrico Cecchetti | journal = Dance Magazine | publisher = Macfadden Performing Arts Media LLC  | date = 2007-01-01 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-156447365.html | accessdate = 2008-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The son of two dancers from [[Civitanova Marche]], he was born in the costuming room of the ''Teatro Tordinona'' in Rome. After an illustrious career as a dancer in Europe, he went to dance for the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] in [[St. Petersburg]], Russia, where he further honed his skills. Cecchetti was praised for his agility and strength in his performances, as well as his technical abilities in dance.&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wiley | first = Roland John  | title = A Century of Russian Ballet | publisher = Oxford Clarendon Press  | year = 1990 | location = New York | page = 375}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1888, he was widely accepted as the greatest [[ballet]] [[virtuoso]] in the world.

After an esteemed career in Russia, originating such roles as both the Bluebird and Carabosse in Petipa's masterpiece, ''[[The Sleeping Beauty Ballet|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', he turned to teaching. Some of his students included other notable dancers of the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]], such as: [[Anna Pavlova]], [[Léonide Massine]], and [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]. While in London in 1920, he provided instruction to the American ballerina [[Ruth Page (ballerina)|Ruth Page]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.nypl.org/dan/19658 ''New York Public Library Archives - Ruth Page Collection 1918-70'' at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts - Jerome Robbins Dance Division, New York City, USA on archives.nypl.org]&lt;/ref&gt; He also restaged many ballets, including Petipa's definitive version of ''[[Coppélia]]'' in 1894, from which nearly all modern versions of the work are based. (This version was notated in the early 20th century, and is today part of the [[Sergeyev Collection]]). While teaching a class, Cecchetti collapsed and he died the following day, 13 November 1928.

Changes to the choreography of the [[Variation (ballet)|male variations]] featured in the works of the Imperial Ballet's repertory. In 1890, Cecchetti performed in the ground-breaking production of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', where his performance as the Bluebird caused a sensation in the audience at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. The choreography of the Bluebird has challenged male dancers even to the present day.

Cecchetti left the Imperial ballet in 1902 to accept the directorship of the Imperial Ballet School in [[Warsaw]], Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. His farewell gala at the Mariinsky Theatre featured all of the leading ballerinas of the day, many of whom were his students. In order to have everyone pay him homage, the ''[[Paquita]]'' Grand pas classique was performed, with the inclusion of the favorite solos of all of the participating ballerinas. This led to the tradition of including a long suite of variations for several ballerinas.

In 1919 Cecchetti performed at the inaugural performance of the ballet, ''[[La Boutique fantasque]],'' in London, appearing in the role of the shopkeeper.&lt;ref name="australiadancing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiadancing.org/subjects/4861.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808045124/http://www.australiadancing.org/subjects/4861.html |archivedate=2011-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mariinsky Theatre==

In 1887 Cecchetti performed in St. Petersburg where [[Ivan Vsevolozhsky]], the director of the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] saw him perform. He was so impressed with Cecchetti that he immediately hired Cecchetti as a principal dancer for the theatre.&lt;ref name="Brillarelli"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brillarelli | first = Livia  | title = Cecchetti A Ballet Dynasty | publisher = Dance Collection Danse Educational Publications | year = 1995 | location = Toronto | page = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was extremely rare at the time because normally dancers would be asked to join a company on a lower level.

With the introduction of the [[pointe shoe]] in the early 19th century, ballet was dominated by female performers using [[pointe|pointe technique]].&lt;ref name="Bland"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Bland  | first = Alexander  | last2 = Percival  | first2 = John  | title = Men Dancing  | place = New York  | publisher = Macmillan Publishing Company  | year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways male technique had been reduced to the role of an actor whose responsibilities as a dancer were relegated to a servant who partnered the ballerina.&lt;ref name="Cass"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cass | first = Joan  | title = Dancing Through History | publisher = Prentice Hall Inc | year = 1993 | location = Englewood Cliffs | page = 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cecchetti immediately began transforming the traditionally conservative roles for the male dancer, making drastic changes to the choreography of the [[Variation (ballet)|male variations]] featured in the works of the Imperial Ballet's repertory. In 1890, Cecchetti performed in the ground-breaking production of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', where his performance as the Bluebird caused a sensation in the auditorium of the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. The choreography of the Bluebird has challenged male dancers even to the present day.

Cecchetti left the Imperial ballet in 1902 to accept the directorship of the Imperial Ballet School in Warsaw, Poland. His farewell gala at the Mariinsky Theatre featured all of the leading ballerinas of the day, many of whom were his students. In order to have everyone pay him homage, the ''[[Paquita]]'' Grand pas classique was performed with the inclusion of the favorite solos of all of the participating ballerinas. This led to the tradition of including a long suite of variations for several ballerinas.

In 1919 Cecchetti performed at the inaugural performance of the ballet ''[[La Boutique fantasque]]'' in London, appearing in the role of the shopkeeper.&lt;ref name="australiadancing"/&gt;

==Teaching==

In the tradition of classical ballet, techniques and parts are taught directly, person to person. The technique was passed on directly to Enrico Cecchetti, as he was taught by Giovanni Lepri, who in turn was taught by Carlo Blasis and the line can be traced back to Beauchamp the first ballet master at the court of Louis X1V. So, too, the Cecchetti method has been passed on directly by his former pupils such as [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-laura-wilson-1097378.html Laura Wilson].

Cecchetti died in Milan on 13 November 1928.

==Cecchetti Method==

{{main|Cecchetti method}}

Cecchetti created a ballet technique that is now known as the Cecchetti method. This technique is popular with past and present ballet teachers, remaining fresh and contemporary.&lt;ref name="Poesio 80"&gt;Poesio pg 80&lt;/ref&gt; After Cecchetti's death, Cyril Beaumont, Stanislas Idzikowsky, [[Margaret Craske]] and Derra de Moroda decided to codify Cecchetti's method so it could continue to be used by ballet teachers to perfect the technique of ballet dancers.&lt;ref name= "Brillarelli 59"&gt;Brillarelli pg 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abt.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abt.org|title=American Ballet Theatre|work=abt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Cecchetti Method, dancers follow strict routines and daily exercises to develop all-around skills to support learning and performance of every kind of dance.&lt;ref name="abt.org"/&gt; This training method is used by many ballet companies around the world, including The [[National Ballet of Canada]] and Mont Albert Ballet School in [[Melbourne, Australia]].

'''''Fish Tycoon ''''' is a [[casual game]] created and developed by [[Last Day of Work]]. One of the top-selling downloadable games of 2004, 2005, and 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Logler.com, "[http://www.logler.com/global-top-10 Global Casual Games Top 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019112033/http://www.logler.com/global-top-10 |date=2011-10-19 }}," ''logler.com'' (10-Apr-2006).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fish Tycoon'' was later ported to cell phone, retail, and Nintendo DS.

== Game Storyline ==
Players take on the role of a fish store owner who must breed and care for hundreds of different kinds of exotic [[fish]], all the while attempting to keep the fish store economically viable long enough to achieve the ultimate objective: breeding The Seven Magic Fish of Isola.  The story for this game is that on the mysterious island of Isola there was a lagoon where the most magnificent fish swam. These fish were held together by the 7 magic fish but one day all of the fish have disappeared. Thus, you have to cross-breed fish to rediscover the 7 magic fish, solve the genetic puzzle,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cohen, "[http://www.macworld.com/article/49980/2006/03/fishtycoon.html Fish Tycoon maker seeks Mac beta testers]," ''Macworld'' (Mar 21, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and "restore the island to its former glory."&lt;ref&gt;James Shiell, "[http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=3272 Fish Tycoon review]," ''geekzone'' (30-AUG-2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fourth Grade''' (also called '''Grade Four''', equivalent to [[Year Five]] in England and Wales) is a year of elementary [[education]] in some countries. In North America, the fourth grade is the fifth school year of [[elementary school]]. Students are usually 9–10 years old, depending on their birthday. It is a part of elementary school, a school providing instruction for young pupils, comprising traditionally of grades K-6. In some school districts, Fourth Grade is the first year of intermediate school or the last year of elementary. Examples of lessons taught include: larger place value; how to write a good summary; writing with transitions; how to read large numbers; writing with starter sentence; and detailed sentences.

==Argentina equivalent==
In [[Education in Argentina|Argentina]], the minimum age required for fourth grade is from 8 to 9 years old. In this instance, children who are in the middle of primary school performed the "confirmation of loyalty to the homeland," is an act in which children will have to swear to the Argentina country to "defend for the rest of his life". Sometimes children do a trip to [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]],  where raises the [[National Flag Memorial (Argentina)]].

==Canada equivalent==
In elementary public schools, the study of the [[French Language]] begins.

==Dutch and Belgian equivalent==
In [[Education in the Netherlands|The Netherlands]], the fourth year of school is called group 6, and the pupils are 9 to 10 years old. Children start at school at the age of 4 and end school at the age of 12 or 13. In Belgium, it is called 4th (study) year. The children are also around the age 9 and 10.

==France equivalent==
In [[France]], the equivalent to the above grade is the [[:fr:CM1|Level 1 Intermediate Course]], known by its short form CM1.

==India equivalent==
In [[India]], children enter Class 6 at ages 9 to 10.&lt;ref&gt;[[Primary education#India]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland equivalent==
In [[The Republic of Ireland]], the equivalent is '''Fourth Class''' or '''Rang a Ceathair''' (for 9- to 10-year-olds) which is year 6 of Primary School.

==New Zealand equivalent==
In [[New Zealand]], this level of class is called Standard 3 or Year 5. Children generally start this level between the ages of nine and ten.

==Portugal equivalent==
In [[Portugal]], what North Americans would call the fourth grade (''quarto ano'', ''4º ano'' to Portuguese people) is the fourth and last year of the four-year ''1º Ciclo do Ensino Básico'' that includes also the [[first grade]], the [[second grade]] and the [[third grade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cdp.portodigital.pt/educacao-e-formacao/ensino-basico-e-secundario|title=  Ensino Básico e Secundário |accessdate= 2012-10-15|work= cdp.portodigital.pt|language= Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students take final exams (''provas finais'') of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[mathematics]] at the end of the fourth grade since the school year of 2012/2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://expresso.sapo.pt/ministro-da-educacao-anuncia-exames-nacionais-no-4-ano=f714651|title=  Ministro da Educação anuncia exames nacionais no 4º ano|author= Isabel Leiria|date= 2012-03-26|accessdate= 2012-10-15|work= expresso.sapo.pt|publisher= [[Impresa]]|language= Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Sociedade/Educacao/Interior.aspx?content_id=2385820|title= Alunos do 4.º ano vão ter exames a partir do próximo ano|date= 2012-03-26|accessdate= 2012-10-15|work= www.jn.pt|publisher= [[controlinveste]]|language= Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In [[Education in England|England]], compulsory education begins with the first new term of the Reception year following a child's 5th birthday &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/school-attendance-absence|title=School attendance and absence|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In practice, many children enter Reception at the beginning of the school year, aged 4. The sixth year of school is called year 4 (starting with nursery- or kindergarten- then reception, then year 1, year 2, year 3, then year 4), and the pupils are 8 to 9 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Schoolslearninganddevelopment/ExamsTestsAndTheCurriculum/DG_4016665|title=The national curriculum|author=|date=|website=direct.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth grade is the equivalent of 'Year 5' (ages 9–10) in England and [[Education in Wales|Wales]], Primary 6 in [[Education in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] and Primary 6 in [[Education in Scotland|Scotland]] - the sixth year of compulsory education in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

==United States==
4th Grade in the United States is a grade or level in which students need to be about 9–10 years old. Students study subjects such as [[math]], [[science]], [[English grammar]] and [[writing]], [[literature]], and  [[history]] (often their state of residence during 4th grade). Most schools also offer [[health]], [[music]], [[art]], and [[physical education]]. In some school districts, It is the first year of [[Intermediate school]] or the last year of [[Elementary school]].

Most states have adopted the [[Common Core]] standards. These standards state what students should accomplish at the conclusion of each grade level. 4th grade standards can be found at :///Math/Content/4/introduction/

==Spain equivalent==

In Spain, ''Primaria'' (6 to 12 years old) is compulsory for all children. 4th grade is called ''cuarto de Primaria'' or simply ''cuarto curso''. 
''Primaria'' starts at six years old, so students usually start 4th grade the year of their tenth birthday. However, there may be eleven years old students because the educational system allows students to repeat a school grade if they do not achieve the passing grade in a specific number of subjects, which varies among each school and the grade that is to be repeated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8746">A '''frozen zoo''' is a storage facility in which genetic materials taken from animals (e.g. [[DNA]], [[sperm]], [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], [[embryos]] and live tissue) are stored at very low temperatures  (−196&amp;nbsp;°C) in tanks of liquid nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiwum.wiz.pl/1997/97122600.asp|title=ZAMROŻONE ZOO|author=Magdalena Pecul| publisher=„Wiedza i Życie”|date=December 1997|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material preserved in this way can be stored indefinitely&lt;ref name=AudubonFZ /&gt; and used for [[artificial insemination]], [[in vitro fertilisation]], embryo transfer, and [[cloning]]. Some facilities also collect and cryopreserve plant material (usually seeds).

The first frozen zoo was established at the [[San Diego Zoo]] by pathologist [[Kurt Benirschke]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/conservation-biologist-and-placenta-expert-kurt-benirschke-dies-64809|title=Conservation Biologist and Placenta Expert Kurt Benirschke Dies; He established the San Diego Zoo’s cryopreserved Frozen Zoo.|last=Williams|first=Shawna|date=September 14, 2018|work=The Scientist|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/29/frozen-zoo-san-diego-rhino|title=The Frozen Zoo aiming to bring endangered species back from the brink|last=Harris|first=Paul|date=August 28, 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/14/tech/main525521.shtml|author=Dan Collins|title=San Diego's Frozen Zoo|publisher=The [[Associated Press]] and [[CBS News]]|date=2002-10-14 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there was no technology available to make use of the collection, but Benirschke believed such technology would be developed in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mashable.com/2017/02/28/san-diego-frozen-zoo/#mgh8BlFlaqqm|title=Extinct animals find new futures at the 'frozen zoo'|last1=Squarci|first1=Gaia|last2=Cornet|first2=Laurence|date=February 28, 2017|work=Mashable|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frozen zoo idea was later supported in Gregory Benford's 1992 paper proposing a Library of Life.&lt;ref&gt; Gregory Benford, Nov, 15, 1992. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC50491/ "Saving the Library of Life"] &lt;/ref&gt; Zoos such as the San Diego Zoo and research programs such as the Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auduboninstitute.org/research-center/ssc|title=Species Survival Center|publisher=Audubon Nature Institute|accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AudubonFZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auduboninstitute.org/saving-species/frozen-zoo

Gathering material for a frozen zoo is rendered simple by the abundance of [[sperm]] in males. Sperm can be taken from an animal following death. The production of eggs, which in females is usually low, can be increased through [[hormone treatment]] to obtain 10–20 [[oocyte]]s, dependent on the species. Some frozen zoos prefer to fertilize eggs and freeze the resulting embryo, as embryos are more resilient under the cryopreservation process.&lt;ref name=Sharjah /&gt; Some centers also collect skin cell samples of endangered animals or extinct species. The [[Scripps Research Institute]] has successfully made skin cells into cultures of special cells called induced pluripotent stem cells ([[Induced pluripotent stem cell|IPS cells]]). It is theoretically possible to make sperm and egg cells from these IPS cells.&lt;ref name = "guardian"/&gt; 

==Existing frozen zoos==
The Frozen Zoo at the San Diego Zoo's Institute for Conservation Research currently stores a collection of  8,400 samples from over 800 species and subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/conservation/science/at_the_zoo/the_frozen_zoo/|title=Chill Out: Frozen Zoo Aiding Conservation Projects|publisher=San Diego Zoo|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frozen Zoo at San Diego Zoo Conservation Research has acted as a forbearer to similar projects at other zoos in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo/whats-on/scientific-meeting-frozen-ark,234,EV.html|title=Scientific Meeting - The Frozen Ark Project|publisher=ZSL London Zoo|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frozenark.org/|title=Welcome to the Frozen Ark|publisher=The Frozen Ark Project|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are still less than a dozen frozen zoos worldwide.&lt;ref name=AudubonFZ /&gt;

At the United Arab Emirates Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife (BCEAW), [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]], the embryos stored include the extremely endangered [[Gordon’s wildcat]] (''Felis silvestris gordoni'') and the [[Arabian leopard]] (''Panthera pardus nimr'') (of which there are only 50 in the wild).&lt;ref name=Sharjah&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabianwildlife.uaeinteract.com/current/fr_zoo.html|title=The Frozen Zoo: Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife, Sharjah, UAE|author=F.J. de Haas van Dorsser MA VetMB MRCVS|publisher=Arabian Wildlife|accessdate=2010-04-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521054237/http://arabianwildlife.uaeinteract.com/current/fr_zoo.html|archivedate=2010-05-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species, affiliated with the [[University of New Orleans]], is maintaining a frozen zoo. In 2000 the Center implanted a frozen-thawed embryo from the highly endangered African wildcat into the uterus of a domestic house cat, resulting in a healthy male wildcat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/03/010309080531.htm|title=The Frozen Zoo: The University Of New Orleans And The New World Of Saving Endangered Species|date=March 12, 2001|work=Science Daily|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Georgia's Regenerative Bioscience Center is building a frozen zoo. RBC Director Steven Stice and animal and dairy science assistant professor Franklin West created the facility with the thought of saving endangered cat species. The scientists have already extracted cells from a Sumatran tiger, which could be used for artificial insemination. Artificial insemination provides a remedy for animals who, due to anatomical or physiological reasons, are unable to reproduce in the natural way. Reproduction of stored genetic material also allows for the fostering of genetic improvements, and the prevention of inbreeding. Modern technology allows for genetic manipulation in animals without keeping them in captivity. However, the success of their restoration into the wild would require the application of new science and a sufficient amount of previously collected material.&lt;ref name=Sharjah /&gt;

{{ For|the police rank|Inspector }}

'''Inspektor''', Swedish for '''Inspector''', is the largely honorary [[chairman]]ship of a [[nations at Swedish universities|student nation]]s in [[Lund University|Lund]] and [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] universities in [[Sweden]]. The Inspector has a supervisory role his/her nation and presides over most important functions. It is a quite prestigious role to be invited to undertake as it implies the trust and respect of the student community. The inspector may be of either gender and is usually a professor (although any member of the university's teaching staff is acceptable). The position originated in the 17th century as a way for the university administration to keep watch on the student population after both Uppsala and Lund universities realised that they were unable to forbid the nation system outright. 

In many nations, the Inspector is also the chairman of the nation's governing committee. They used to be present at the nation's [[annual general meeting]] (known as a "Landsskap") as well as other special occasions such as the Newcomer's Feast ("Novichfest" or "Recentiorsgasque"). Mostly it is the Inspector who makes the speech of honour at the end of each formal dinner in the nation and at the end of each semester he or she ceremonially "sends the students home". 

Inspectors now also exist at some technical colleges, at some other universities and in some Swedish [[Students' union|student union]]s. In the latter, the inspector has some role as a person to whom one may complain about university processes.

The '''Institute of Molecular Biotechnology (IMBA)''' is an independent research organisation founded as a joint initiative of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in cooperation with the pharmaceutical company [[Boehringer Ingelheim]]. IMBA operates in close collaboration with the [[Research Institute of Molecular Pathology]], Boehringer's basic research center both located next to each other at the [[Vienna Biocenter]] (VBC).

==Research==
IMBA's research aims to understand the fundamental [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] processes and is currently focused on [[cell biology]], [[RNA interference]], and [[epigenetics]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Associated projects===
The Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC) is located at IMBA, and is available to researchers worldwide.&lt;ref name="IMBAFlies"&gt;{{cite web | title=Fly House | website=IMBA - Institute of Molecular Biotechnology | url=https://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at/scientific-facilities/fly-house/ | access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It collects an RNAi library of over 22,000 [[Drosophila]] strains.

==History==
The Institute of Molecular Biotechnology was founded in 1999 as a joint initiative of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and Boehringer Ingelheim. The Austrian Government and the city of Vienna would also contribute to its funding and in 2002 the geneticist [[Josef Penninger]] started  as the Scientific Director of IMBA who would recruit [[Barry Dickson]] as the first group leader; Dickson became managing director of the neighbouring institute [[Research Institute of Molecular Pathology]] (IMP) in 2006.

The construction of the institute started in 2003 and completed in 2006. The institute lies wall-to-wall with the IMP, to enhance collaborations and with whom they share the scientific facilities.

IMBA went on expanding and in 2007 the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC) in collaboration with the IMP is opened.

Since 2007 IMBA has a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) for decision making chaired by Nobel prize winner [[Eric Kandel]].

==Awards==
Being a newcomer in the Molecular Biology community, the IMBA has soon received recognition in the form of awards to its researchers and grants for projects. Josef Penninger, the scientific director, has been elected as a full member of The Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW). He has been awarded the [[Ernst Jung Prize]] for Medicine by the Jung-Stiftung for Science and Research, the [[Descartes Prize]] for Research by the [[European Commission]] and has received the Carus-Medal of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]]. In 2012, Josef Penninger was awarded with the Innovator Award for his project "Novel Approaches to Breast Cancer Prevention and Inhibition of Metastases" through the [[US Department of Defense]].

In 2013 Josef Penninger received his second [[European Research Council]]’s (ERC) Advanced Investigator Grant for his research in the field of [[haploid]] [[stem cells]].

Jürgen Knoblich, deputy scientific director at IMBA, was recognized with the [[Wittgenstein Award]], awarded by the Austrian [[Ministry of Education (Austria)|Ministry of Science]].

The institute has also received support by the European Research Council and Kazufumi Mochizuki has received one of the [[European Research Council]]'s first "ERC Starting grants".

==Science Communication==
In collaboration with the incorporated society Dialog Gentechnik, in 2006 IMBA opened the Vienna Open Lab, a hands-on biomolecular laboratory open to the public.&lt;ref name="Open Science"&gt;{{cite web | title=Open Science | website=Open Science | url=http://www.viennaopenlab.at/ | language=de | access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Accounting Education Standards Board''' (IAESB) is  an independent organisation within the fold of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC). The board develops guidance to improve standards of education in accountancy.
The two main areas of focus are the key elements of accreditation and the requirements of accountants for continuing professional education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://web.ifac.org/publications/international-accounting-education-standards-board
 |title=International Accounting Education Standards Board
 |publisher=IFAC
 |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The board also sponsors studies or papers about accounting education that promote discussion and debate on accounting education and development issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=International Accounting Education Standards
 |publisher=Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants
 |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

Members of the board may be nominated by IFAC member bodies or by IFAC's Transnational Auditors Committee. 
Public members may be nominated by member bodies, the TAC, other organizations and the general public.
The [[International Association for Accounting Education &amp; Research]] (IAAER) has an observer of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An IAAER research program funded by the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) creates research reports that inform the IAESB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.iaaer.org/research/
 |title=Research Grants
 |publisher=IAAER
 |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The IAESB is subject to the oversight of the [[Public Interest Oversight Board]] (PIOB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=World Bank
 |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

In January 2010 the IAESB released its Framework for International Education Standards for Professional Accountants.
This paper defines the underlying educational concepts of the IAESB standards, describes the IAESB publications, and affirms the obligations of IFAC member bodies relating to accounting education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |date=4 January 2010
 |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The IAESB periodically updates standards.
In March 2010 the IAESB asked for comments on a proposed revision to the International Education Standard that defined Competence Requirements for Audit Professionals. This is one of the eight standards that address the principles of learning and development for professional accountants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''International Astronomical Youth Camp (IAYC)''' is an annual [[summer camp]] for young people with an interest in [[astronomy]]. Established in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=International Astronomical Youth Camp|last1=Glendinning|first1=A.|journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association|date=1969|volume=80|page=53|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1969JBAA...80...53G|bibcode=1969JBAA...80...53G}}&lt;/ref&gt; the IAYC has taken place in over 30 different places in [[Europe]], [[Northern Africa|North Africa]] and the [[Near East]]. The main goals of the camp are for participants to have fun collaborating in astronomical explorations, and to bring people together from different regions of the world by encouraging them to work together and learn more about science and its methods. Participants work on astronomical projects in working groups. Since 1969 more than 1500 young people have taken part in the IAYC. Nowadays, between 60 and 75 people participate in each camp.

The IAYC attracts all kinds of participants: those who enjoy astronomy as a general interest to those make it their job. Some participants have later on gained astronomy related jobs that brought them fame. Examples are [[Erich Karkoschka]], a German astronomer and [[Govert Schilling]], a Dutch science journalist.

Recent camps have seen participants organizing so called ''Preunions'' in advance of the camp. These events are used to get to know each other and see a little bit more of the neighbourhood, as most of the camp will take place in an isolated area.

Throughout the year, many reunions take place. A returning tradition is the so-called ''New Year's Reunion'', which is organized by a participant, anywhere in Europe. Successful reunions have seen more than 30 participants. Recent locations have been England, Hungary, Belgium, Serbia and Macedonia.

==A day in IAYC==
As practical astronomy is mainly carried out during the night, the daily schedule is quite unnormal, as it is moved into a few hours ahead. A typical day is as following:

*''11.30 hrs'' - Waking-up service (Run by the NAP-Leader)
*''12.00 hrs'' - Breakfast
*''13.00 hrs'' - Working group session 1
*''15.30 hrs'' - Free time
*''17.30 hrs'' - Dinner
*''19.30 hrs'' - Non Astronomical Program
*''22.00 hrs'' - Working group session 2
*''00.00 hrs'' - Night meal
*''After midnight'' - Observation

===Working Groups===
The participants are divided into groups (for which they apply in advance) that all deal with a specific field of astronomy. They are meant to carry out a project on a topic that has to do with the theme of the working group. The project is to be done individually or in a group of two or three people. It is carried out independently, though with the supervising help of a leader.

The topics may vary from beginner's work, in which the participant gets introduced to the field of astronomy, to in depth astrophysics and actual research, usually carried out by a more experienced participant. At the end of the camp, the participants write an article about their project. The articles are bundled into a report book that is sent to the participants after the camp.

Every group has its own leader. The themes of the working groups may differ very much, from theoretical (where the focus is on the mathematical and physical side of astronomy and astrophysics) to practical (where the focus on observational astronomy and the use of [[telescope]]s cannot be ignored). This is just a rough explanation, as there have also been groups that fit neither of the two explanations but focus more on background, like ones with a more philosophical character. The theme of the group depends very much on the leader attached to it and his/her background.

Besides the working group leaders, three other leaders are also included in the leader team. The ''general coordinator'' takes care of supervision and is the contact person. The ''NAP-leader'' organises the Non-Astronomical Program, which is described later on in this article. The ''Darkroom leader'' is responsible for the photography in the camp. He or she also runs a [[darkroom]] in which black and white photographs are developed (mainly astronomical photographs).

===Free time===
During the free time, the participants are totally free to do whatever they want. Many use this opportunity to organize a workshop, in which they can share their passions with other participants. A returning workshop is on the use of a telescope. Also (sports) competitions are organized during the free time.

===Non-Astronomical Program===
The Non-Astronomical Program (NAP) is held daily in order to give the participants the opportunity to relax and to get to know each other better. NAP has its own leader that supervises the games and activities, of which many have become traditions in the IAYC. There are a few special NAP's:

*'''The movie''' Every year a movie is shot, which has a special topic, made up by the NAP-leader. Every working group gets a camera and has to shoot a short film related to the topic for one day. Usually these films include a large amount of sarcasm towards habits of the camp.
*'''National Evening''' On this evening all participants gather in groups consisting of all people from their own nation. Every group has to give a short presentation on something that is typical for their country. Often, the presentations are hilarious and participants like to present their country in an ironic way.
*'''Poetry Evening''' Participants share their favourite poetry, from any language.

===Observation===
During the night, many participants try to enjoy the beauty of the night sky as much as possible, as long as the weather allows them. Practical working groups try to run their projects with the use of telescopes and other devices, which are all carried to the observation field. Also participants from other working groups join: sleeping under the night sky is something very special.

Special moments on which many people like to go to the observation field include the peak of the [[Perseids|Perseid showers]], on the 11th of August, should the camp be taking place at that time. If the weather is too bad, however, most participants attend one of the many parties, organized throughout the camp.

===Special days===
There are two special days in the camp, namely the following:

*'''Excursion day''' During this day, an excursion is organized. It is meant to show something that is specific for the area in with the camp is held. After that, a hike through the area is held, after which a local town in visited. This day is used to visit the internet facilities as well, as the participants cannot make use of internet during the camp itself. The excursion day ends with a party on the camp site.
*'''Free day''' On this day, the camp is 'at rest'. The participants are free to do whatever they want. Most participants choose to make a short trip in the area, either sightseeing a nearby city or hiking/cycling surrounding nature. Others choose to stay back at the camphouse and relax for the day.

==IWA==
The organization behind the IAYC is called ''The International Workshop for Astronomy''. It is responsible for the camp and consists of the leaders, who all do this on a voluntarily basis.

==Time line==
The first IAYC's were all held in Germany and its bordering countries. Later on, also other countries were visited. In the late 1970s even camps were held in the Near East and North Africa). As of the 1980s, the focus lay on Europe again. An important condition for the choice of a location has always been that it is as far from centres of population as possible such that observations can be performed free from [[light pollution]].

Since 2002 the IAYC has been held Germany and the Czech and Slovak republics. The number of participants has changed over the years. In the first year, just more than 40 people attended the camp. In 1999, in which the [[Solar eclipse of August 11, 1999|solar eclipse of that summer]] was a major event, 99 people participated, excluding former participants of previous camps who joined for a one-week old-oldies special reunion. In recent years the number of participants (including leaders) has remained stable around 60-75.

The [[Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything|42]]nd (July 16 - August 5, 2006), the 43rd (July 29 - August 18, 2007) and the 47th (July 17 - August 6, 2011) IAYC took place in [[Třemešek]], [[Czech Republic]]. However, having three camps taking place in the same place in three consecutive years is exceptional.

The 44th camp took place in [[Sayda]], in the [[Germany|German]] federal state of [[Saxony]] from 20 July until 9 August 2008, the site of the 33rd (1997) and 40th (2004) camps.
The 45th camp was held in [[Hala Miziowa]] ([[Poland]]).

==Related camps==
The IAYC is not the only youth camp that focusses on astronomy. In Germany the Astronomische Abenteuer Camp (AAC; Astronomical Adventure Camp) is held annually around Easter and the Astronomische SommerLager (ASL; Astronomical Summer Camp) is held yearly in the summer. In The Netherlands, the Youngsters Working Group for Astronomy organizes several youth camps every year. Several Slovenian astronomical associations organize MART (Youth astronomy research camp) together. It is held in August in Slovenia. Youths from neighbour countries participate too because the camp is very well known in the area.

'''JEI Learning Center''' is an individualized, supplemental education franchise.  A low student-to-teacher ratio allows only 5 students per instructor, ensuring that each student receives enough personal attention. The curriculum offers JEI Self-Learning Method, a self-paced, individualized program designed to help pre-kindergarten to 9th grade students in learning math and language concepts step-by-step, aligned with [[Common Core State Standards]]. JEI Learning Center provides a diagnostic test and track record system that pinpoints fundamental strengths and weaknesses in subject comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxviewlearning.com |title=Academic Programs and Diagnostic Tests |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using these results, specialized workbooks are assigned that focus on a scientific study method to address each student’s needs. 

==History==
Established in 1977 by educator and entrepreneur, Sung Hoon Park, JEI Learning Center was founded in [[Seoul, Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.jeilearning.com/About-Us/History |title=The History of JEI Learning Center |accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sung Hoon Park and a team of education researchers developed the JEI Self Learning Method, an individually paced, step-by-step learning program, for students who need supplementary education in mathematics and language concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/education/jei-learning-centers.html |title=JEI Self Learning Method |accessdate=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After decades of successful operation in [[South Korea]],  in 1992, Sung Hoon Park brought the JEI Method to the [[United States]], followed by [[Canada]], [[UAE]], [[Hong Kong]], [[China]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], consisting of over 500 locations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/jeilearningcenters/326137-0.html |title=JEI Learning Centers Franchises |accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Josephine Riley''' is a British writer, translator, theatre actor, and schoolteacher. Dr. Riley has written and translated several books about [[theatre arts]], especially [[Chinese theatre]]. She currently teaches film and drama at [[Munich International School]] in Germany.

&lt;!--[[WP:NOTABILITY]] paragraph--&gt;Riley reads, writes, and speaks [[Mandarin Chinese]], and is better known for having in the early 1980s widely traveled in China and learned to act in the [[Chinese theatre]]&lt;ref name=Mackerras1999/&gt; as one of the first foreign students at the [[Central Academy of Drama in Beijing]],&lt;ref name=ISTA2008/&gt; eventually writing ''Chinese Theatre and the Actor in Performance'' (1997, [[Cambridge University Press]]), a reference book that "gives an 'inside' view of Chinese theatre and the actor in performance for the first time [...] from her personal observations of, and dialogue with, Chinese actors and her first-hand experiences of the theatre world of China in general, none of which was possible before 1980."&lt;ref name=pubdesc&gt;[http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/description/cam028/96031554.html Publisher description for the book], archived at the [[Library of Congress]], catdir.loc.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; She also made the first English translation of ''[[The Other Shore (play)|The Other Shore]]'' by [[Nobel Laureate in Literature]] playwright [[Gao Xingjian]].

==Biography==

===Life===
[[File:Chinese theater.jpg|thumb|An example of Chinese theater.]]
Jo Riley graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=ISTA2008&gt;ISTA 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After working for a number of small touring companies, she went to Asia to explore a different kind of theatre. In the early 1980s, after learning [[Mandarin Chinese]], she was one of the first foreign students at the [[Central Academy of Drama in Beijing]],&lt;ref name=ISTA2008/&gt; where she learned to act in the [[Chinese theatre]] (''example pictured at right'').&lt;ref name=Mackerras1999/&gt;

She has since then helped teach and direct traditional Chinese theatre in Salzburg, Mainz, and Bayreuth.&lt;ref name=ISTA2008/&gt; She's also been at intercultural workshops with Cardiff Laboratory Theatre and Pan Projects at Goldsmiths College, London.&lt;ref name=ISTA2008/&gt; In addition, she has written articles and books on Chinese theatre, especially ''Chinese Theatre and the Actor in Performance'' (1997, see Works section), and has edited or translated several plays or books on European and [[intercultural theatre]].

She currently teaches drama at [[Munich International School]]&lt;ref name=ISTA2008/&gt; in Germany.

===Works===
[[File:Beijing-Opera2.jpg|thumb|An example of male performer of ''jingju'', the [[Beijing opera]].]]
In 1997, [[Cambridge University Press]] published Riley's ''Chinese Theatre and the Actor in Performance'', a book often cited on the topic of [[Chinese theatre]].  It covers not only ''jingju'' ([[Beijing opera]] or Peking opera, ''example pictured at right'') but also Chinese puppet theatre and [[shadow play]], as well as Chinese exorcism and ancient animation rites at the tomb, to explore how the Chinese create presence on a stage.&lt;ref name=pubdesc/&gt; In a 1999 review for the ''[[Asian Theatre Journal]]'', China specialist Prof. [[Colin Mackerras]] (author of ''The Cambridge Handbook of Contemporary China'', brother of [[Malcolm Mackerras]]) noted how the book "looks at the skills of the Chinese actor from the insider's point of view – not that of the Westerner or the student of China."&lt;ref name=Mackerras1999&gt;Mackerras 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed:

{{quote|Jo Riley is one of the few people in the West qualified to undertake such a study because she not only knows Chinese but has learned to act in the Chinese theatre. She has traveled widely in China and examined the various styles of regional theatre that are so abundant and important in China. Although nobody can really divorce himself from his own culture, nor is it sensible to try, Jo Riley does speak as an insider of the Chinese theatre in a way few non-Chinese can match.&lt;ref name=Mackerras1999/&gt;}}

Riley also made, under the title ''The Other Side'' (1997), the first English translation of the controversial play ''[[The Other Shore (play)|The Other Shore]]'' (1986) by [[Nobel Laureate in Literature]] playwright [[Gao Xingjian]].

The '''''Mission laïque française''''' ('''MLF'''), or "French lay (or secular) mission", is a non-profit organisation founded in 1902 by Pierre Deschamps. This organisation works to spread the [[French language]] and culture by creating and running schools outside [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlfmonde.org/qui-sommes-nous/notre-histoire/ History of the Mission laïque française on the MLF website]&lt;/ref&gt; Its head office is in the [[15th arrondissement of Paris]].

==School network==
By the end of 2016, the MLF was running schools in 47 different countries:   [[Afghanistan]], [[Algeria]], [[Angola]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cameroon]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Côte d’Ivoire]], [[DR of the Congo]], [[Egypt]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Finland]], [[Gabon]], [[Greece]], [[Haiti]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], [[Italy]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Morocco]], [[Nigeria]], [[Norway]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Senegal]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Syria]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[UAE]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Uzbekistan]] [[Venezuela]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlfmonde.org/etablissements/ School presentations on the official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 108 schools are divided into two networks: traditional schools and schools in joint ventures with big French companies such as [[Total S.A.]], [[Areva]], [[Airbus]] and [[Bouygues]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlfmonde.org/partenaire/?filtre=ee List of companies]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''National Association of Independent Schools''' ('''NAIS''') is a [[United States|U.S.]]-based membership organization for private, nonprofit, K-12 schools. Founded in 1963, NAIS represents [[independent school]]s and associations in the United States, including [[day school|day]], [[boarding school|boarding]], and day/boarding schools; elementary and secondary schools; boys', girls', and coeducational schools.  NAIS has affiliate members internationally as well.

NAIS's mission is to be the national voice of independent schools and the center for [[collective action]] on their behalf.

==Membership==
As of the 2010-11 school year, NAIS represented approximately 1,400 member independent schools and associations in the US, serving more than 562,000 students and 121,000 teachers, administrators, and other staff.

Membership in NAIS is open to independent pre-college schools that are operated by [[nonprofit]] organizations. To become a full member of NAIS, a school must have operated for at least five years and must be [[educational accreditation|accredited]] by an accrediting organization approved by NAIS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nais.org/about/index.cfm?ItemNumber=145935&amp;sn.ItemNumber=1482&amp;tn.ItemNumber=62506 Membership], NAIS website, accessed October 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== NAIS Commission on Accreditation ==

===Background===

In response to requests from several state, regional, and national accrediting organizations, the NAIS Commission on Accreditation was established by the NAIS Board of Trustees in 2001 and convened for the first time in 2002. The 19 member Commission’s work is intended to assure the quality of independent school accrediting programs.

A primary responsibility of the Commission is to developing a public understanding of, and credibility for, state and regional accrediting programs.  In addition, the Commission,

* develops criteria for effective independent school accreditation practices, exemplary standards, and models of successful accreditation policies and procedures.
* engages in research to inform accreditation practice.

The Commission meets on a regular basis and is guided by established operating protocols.  It is composed of members from state and regional accrediting associations that are members of NAIS was well as at-large members, and NAIS Board members.

===Accountability===

The member associations of the Commission are accountable to one another through a process patterned on the independent school accreditation model. Over the course of a 10-year cycle, associations prepare a self-study demonstrating compliance with the Criteria for Effective Independent School Accreditation Practices. The criteria provide common ground for member associations by delineating best practices, policies, and procedures. In addition, associations use the Model Core Standards — a set of “ideal” standards — in assessing their own standards.  As part of the process of “accrediting the accreditors”, each member association hosts a visit from other Commissioners, receives written recommendations from the Commission, and engages in follow-up activities designed to improve the state or regional accreditation process. As with school accreditation, this will serve two purposes: institutional improvement and quality assurance.

===Criteria for Effective Independent School Accreditation Practices===

Each member associations must be determined to be in compliance with the following:

# The accrediting association holds schools accountable to a comprehensive set of standards related to the educational program and issues of institutional health.
# The accrediting association, recognizing that accreditation is a peer review process, institutes policies and procedures that ensure fairness and impartiality and that are free of conflicts of interest, both in appearance and in fact.  
# The accreditation process consists of a continuing cycle:  self-study by the school, visit and report by a team of trained peers, action by the association, and follow-up by the school and the association.
# The accrediting association monitors the school’s compliance with standards and its progress in addressing the recommendations of the self-study and of the visiting team report. The accrediting association also regularly solicits reports from schools on substantive institutional change and reviews the school’s accreditation status in the light of those changes.
# The decision-making and appeal processes regarding accreditation status in the accreditation cycle are clear and understandable. Policies and procedures are available for public review.
# The accrediting association offers formal and comprehensive preparation and training for all participants in the accreditation process, including team chairs and members, heads of school, self-study coordinators, and accrediting association boards and commissions.  
# The accrediting association engages in regular evaluation and review of its standards and accreditation process and solicits reports from schools and visiting teams on their experience with the process.
# The accrediting association designates a decision-making body charged with overseeing the evaluation and accreditation process and making final decisions regarding accreditation.
# The accreditation process examines the whole school, including all divisions and those programs that are included in the accreditation.
# The accrediting association has a procedure, available to the public and clearly explained, to handle complaints that accredited schools are not meeting standards.
# The accreditation process rests on comprehensive standards which schools must meet.   The standards address all areas of school life, including the following:  mission, governance, finance, program, community of the school, administration, development, admissions, personnel, health and safety, facilities, student services, school culture, and residential life (where applicable).  
# The standards require schools to conduct a thoughtful assessment of individual student progress consistent with the school’s mission.
# The standards require a school to provide evidence of a thoughtful process, respectful of its mission, for informed decision-making that draws on data (both internal and external) about student learning.  
# The standards require a school to demonstrate that its educational programs, instructional practices, and institutional culture are informed by relevant research regarding how students learn and the knowledge and capacities they will need to lead purposeful and constructive lives.
# The self-study process is deliberative, and the self-study report reflects the considered judgment of the school’s professional community.
# A broad cross-section of the community (including all faculty and staff, as well as members of the governing body and others in the community, as appropriate) participate in preparing the self-study.
# The self-study includes reflection and self-analysis as well as description, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and assesses both the school’s compliance with standards and the congruence between its program and mission, and balances documentation of accountability to the accrediting association standards with a focus on school improvement.  The school will provide all required documents in a timely fashion.  
# The accrediting association appoints a visiting team chair who shall be responsible to follow the accrediting association’s guidelines, to ensure the visiting team’s effectiveness, and to protect the integrity of the process.
# The accrediting association appoints a visiting team to conduct a site visit while school is in session.
# The accrediting association is mindful of the circumstances of the school and the full range of the standards in determining the size and selecting the members of a visiting team.
# The visiting team receives advance materials in a timely fashion and arrives at the school fully prepared.
# The visiting team observes the program and interviews school staff, trustees, students, parents, and others as appropriate.  It validates the self-study, evaluates the school’s compliance with standards, and writes a report with commendations and recommendations which is sent to the accrediting association and to the school in a timely fashion.  The report is confidential, except as authorized by the school.  Any release of parts or all of the report to the public must follow the accrediting association guidelines.  
# The length of the visit is sufficient to accomplish the above.
# The members of the visiting team hold confidential the information they receive and their discussions during the accreditation process.
# The accrediting association, or a representative committee, receives and reviews the self-study, and visiting team report, determines the accreditation status of the school, prescribes appropriate actions, and sets up a schedule for future reports and visits.  The school is given an opportunity to respond to the report of the visiting committee in advance of the accrediting association taking action on its accreditation.
# The accrediting association notifies the board chair, as well as the head of school, concerning decisions related to a school’s accreditation.

'''National Testing Service - Pakistan''' ('''NTS''') is an organization in [[Pakistan]] that administers academic performance evaluation tests. It is similar to [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) in the [[United States]]. NTS offers two main types of tests, the ''National Aptitude Test'' (NAT) and the ''[[Graduate Assessment Test]]'' (GAT). NAT is aimed at students seeking admission to colleges and universities. GAT is aimed at graduates seeking admission to [[postgraduate education]]. NTS exams are also used to determine qualifications of students seeking advanced study abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Education. (2 May 2006).

==History==
Controversy erupted in 2007 following the mandating of NTS testing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/112907/testing-1-2-3/|title=Testing 1, 2, 3 - Daily Times|date=30 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; first announced by [[Khalid Maqbool]], [[Governor]] of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], with regards to admission to universities and later set aside by the government unless the laws regarding university admission were amended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.app.com.pk/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6210&amp;Itemid=2 Entry test of public universities through NTS: Governor] Associated Press of Pakistan.

==Legal Education==
In 2016 the [[Pakistan Bar Council]] amended the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Rules 1976 pertaining to admission of new advocates to the provincial [[Bar Councils in Pakistan|Bar Councils]]. The new rules required applicants to sit and pass the Law Graduate Assessment Test (Law GAT) conducted by National Testing Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pakistanbarcouncil.org/nts1/|title=NTS Law GAT|website=pakistanbarcouncil.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

NTS has sought to establish a national educational standard for [[Pakistan]] but at the same time as an organization cannot and has not catered to the regionally diverse Pakistani nation. NTS resources are geographically restricted and both quantitatively and qualitatively limited. As stated by interface - an educational consultancy.  Its contention as an independent NGO can also be challenged as it is affiliated with numerous regular testing centers of [[Comsats]] (as semi-Government body or inter-Governmental organization) &amp; Public / Governmental education Institutions for their entrance / admission exams. 
A recent controversy of regular operational error has also arisen for Phd. assessment tests. The credibility / irresponsibility on the part of NTS officials has disqualified the candidates from applying in MPhil/PhD programs at public and private sector institutes because under HEC rules, they do not have any proof of clearing the test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://10classresult.site  NTS, HEC putting students’ future at stake (3 January 2010)]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628044257/http://10classresult.site/ |date=28 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The overall process lacks credibility &amp; transparency due to the un-disclosed nature of alternative processes for any participants, when they do not fall in the norms of the operating procedure (i.e. errors / loop holes) due to complexities that arise from multifarious of socioeconomic nature of challenges in  present-day environment of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://9classresult.site  9th class result 2018] Daily Times last accessed 17 March 2010.{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\07\20\story_20-7-2008_pg13_3 MPhil students not being awarded degrees without clearing NTS (20 July 2008)].

Dawn News last accessed 19 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Unfortunately, the NTS management have even been caught and identified as plagiarizing test questions and are indirectly controlled by [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (HEC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hec.gov.pk/InsideHEC/Divisions/AECA/SocialSciencesArtsHumanities/Documents/Minutes%20of%20the%204th%20meeting.pdf EXCERPT: Dr. Najma Najam took serious notice of the contents of the test and identified that the contents have been taken (cut &amp; paste) from another international test and a charge of plagiarism can be put on NTS.

'''North Star: Self Directed Learning for Teens''' is a [[Autodidacticism|self-directed]] learning center in [[Sunderland, Massachusetts]], founded in 1996. North Star's mission is to help [[teenagers]] find ways to learn and excel outside of traditional [[Middle school#United States|middle school]] and [[high school]]. It offers a noncoercive learning environment without required classes, grades, or tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members range in age from 11 to 19 years old. Both previously-schooled teens and long-time [[Homeschooling|homeschoolers]] attend the center. As of 2015, North Star has over 60 members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Richie|title=North Star celebrates 20 years of self-directed learning for teens at new home in Sunderland|url=http://www.gazettenet.com/home/19094435-95/north-star-celebrates-20-years-of-self-directed-learning-for-teens-at-new-home-in|website=Gazettenet.com|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 500 alumni from all over the [[Pioneer Valley]] and beyond.

North Star was founded by two Massachusetts middle school teachers who were frustrated with a system that forced students to attend their classes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Maureen|title=The Unschool|url=http://www.valleyadvocate.com/2012/06/14/the-unschool/|website=Valley Advocate|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, North Star supports teenagers to self-direct their own education, offering a program of optional classes, tutoring, trips and community events, taught and organized by North Star's professional staff and an extensive network of volunteers. Each North Star member is paired with an advisor who supports and encourages the teen as they transition to self-directed learning.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Liberated Learners  {{!}}  What Is the North Star Model?|url = http://liberatedlearners.net/about/what-is-the-north-star-model/|website = liberatedlearners.net|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center is funded through sliding-scale tuition and donations.

== History ==
[[Image:Russell Street School, Hadley MA.jpg|thumb|left|150px|&lt;center&gt;Russell Street School building in Hadley, Massachusetts&lt;/center&gt;]]North Star was founded as Pathfinder Learning Center by Kenneth Danford and Joshua Hornick in 1996. After reading [[Grace Llewellyn]]'s book ''[[The Teenage Liberation Handbook]]'' they both quit their jobs as middle school teachers to create a center that would make what Llewellyn described possible for teenagers in their area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2002, the center was renamed North Star: Self-Directed Learning for Teens,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = School is optional - The story of North Star|url = http://schoolisoptional.org/the-story-of-north-star/|website = schoolisoptional.org|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 the center moved into the historic Russell Street School building in [[Hadley, Massachusetts]].

In June, 2015, North Star moved to Sunderland due to safety concerns with the Russell Street building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = North Star to move from Hadley to Sunderland in June after 13 years in town|url = http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/02/north_star_to_move_from_hadley.html|website = masslive.com|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program ==
Using homeschooling as a tool to get out of school, North Star works personally with each teen and their family to create an educational plan that is supported by North Star's staff and teachers. This customized plan consists of a staff adviser, parent conferences, and classes, tutorials, workshops, or tutoring if desired and available. North Star works with every interested family, regardless of ability to pay tuition or fees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Classes, tutorials, and workshops are taught by staff members, volunteers, or college students through [[Federal Work-Study Program|work-study]]. Classes are scheduled Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and the center is closed on Wednesdays and weekends. Attendance is non-compulsory and there are no required classes.

== The North Star model ==
Since 2010, a number of self-directed learning centers have opened in both the United States and Canada, using the approach and program pioneered by North Star. The centers are part of the Liberated Learners network which supports people to create centers based on the North Star model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Ken|title=Creative Schools: The grassroots revolution that's transforming education|date=2015|publisher=Viking|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-670-01671-6|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse'''" is a [[blog]] post by the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) that uses a [[zombie apocalypse]] metaphor to raise public awareness of [[Emergency management|emergency preparedness]].&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; In a blog post titled "Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse", the director of the CDC's Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response, [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral]] [[Ali S. Khan]] writes: "Take a zombie apocalypse for example. That's right, I said z-o-m-b-i-e a-p-o-c-a-l-y-p-s-e. You may laugh now, but when it happens you'll be happy you read this, and hey, maybe you'll even learn a thing or two about how to prepare for a real emergency."&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; Comparing the upcoming [[hurricane]] season and possible [[pandemic]]s to "flesh-eating zombies" from the [[horror film]] ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' and the video game series ''[[Resident Evil]]'', Khan recommends Americans prepare for natural disasters as they would have prepared for "ravenous monsters".&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;

== Inspiration ==

A week before the zombie apocalypse post, members of the CDC group responsible for preparedness of the public for [[natural disaster]]s and pandemics were working on the message anticipating the 2011 hurricane season.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Dave Daigle, associate director for communications, admitted that, "preparedness and public health are not the sexiest subjects."&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Someone in the group remembered a [[Twitter|tweet]] about zombies in connection to the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|nuclear disaster in Japan]] resulting from the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. This provided the idea for the upcoming CDC post,&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; implemented on May 18, 2011 along with two tweets.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; "The whole idea was, if you're prepared for a zombie apocalypse, you're prepared for pretty much anything," said Drew RN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepticality.com/centers-zombie-control-prevention/ | work=Skepticality Podcast | title=Centers for Zombie Control and Prevention | date=2011-10-25 | accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The blog post ==

The CDC's blog post included precautionary tips about zombies along with its usual tips for preparing an emergency kit, as well as emergency escape routes in case of an earthquake or hurricane. For example, after explaining how the public should be prepared "if zombies started appearing outside your doorstep", it  continues: "You can also implement this plan if there is a flood, earthquake, or other emergency."&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt; 

{{quote|Plan your evacuation route. When zombies are hungry they won't stop until they get food (i.e., brains), which means you need to get out of town fast! Plan where you would go and multiple routes you would take ahead of time so that the flesh eaters don't have a chance! This is also helpful when natural disasters strike and you have to take shelter fast.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt;}}

Some commentators noted that May 21, 2011, [[2011 end times prediction|the date predicted by Harold Camping as the beginning of the end-times]], was several days after the blog post, though there was no mention of this speculation in the post itself.&lt;ref name="ABC News - 20May2011 - Brains... brains..."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/05/20/3221851.htm|title=US agency posts zombie apocalypse survival tips |date=May 20, 2011 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]] |accessdate=May 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CDC website crash==

The blog post generated [[Internet traffic]] that eventually crashed the CDC website.&lt;ref name=SA/&gt; Usually, CDC blog posts get traffic between 1,000 and 3,000 hits per week.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; 30,000 hits were reported by the evening of May 18.&lt;ref name=SA/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; The post, oriented at "a young, media-savvy demographic", was read by so many that "by Thursday, it was a trending topic on Twitter".&lt;ref name=SA/&gt; Initially the tweet with the [[tagline]] ''If you're ready for a zombie apocalypse, then you're ready for any emergency'' got 12,000 followers; overnight the number of followers increased to 1.2 million, or 100 times the initial number.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;  Mr. Daigle said that the number of the followers of the CDC's zombie apocalypse tweets was comparable to the number of followers of the [[wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]]: "We were trending yesterday! Things like the Royal Wedding trend. Not the CDC."&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

[[Robert Pestronk]], executive director of the [[National Association of County and City Health Officials]] agreed that "The 'Zombie Apocalypse' scenario was a great way of getting information out so people can understand the need for preparedness."&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

==Reaction==
Daigle said people were visiting the CDC's blog and following CDC tweets because they were mostly interested in zombies and were asking what weapons the agency would recommend to fight zombies. Khan's response to this inquiry was, "remember, we're a public-health center, so we're not going to recommend weapons. We'll leave that to the law-enforcement folks."&lt;ref name=Atlantic1/&gt; Chris Good from ''[[The Atlantic]]'' saw the absence of weapons recommendations (albeit, tongue-in-cheek) as a "downside to the CDC's warning" and wrote: "If a zombie apocalypse does happen—and this is important—do not follow the CDC's guidelines as your only course of action. The CDC zombie plan includes no mention of shotguns, torches, [[hot-wiring]] cars, seeking high ground, traveling at night vs. day, or really any worthwhile strategy for keeping zombies out of your house. Parts of it are good, but it probably would serve the public better in the event of, for instance, a hurricane."&lt;ref name=Atlantic1/&gt;

Others were concerned about [[taxpayer]] money being used for the CDC's budget; the CDC assured the public there was no additional cost for their zombie apocalypse blog post.&lt;ref name=CBS1/&gt;

Bill Gentry with the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health|UNC-Chapel Hill School of Public Health]] said that the CDC deserves credit for trying something different, "but that doesn't mean the agency should start using vampires to promote vaccinations or space aliens to warn about the dangers of smoking."&lt;ref name=Boomerang/&gt;

==Video contest==
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] announced a contest for the most creative and effective videos covering preparedness for a zombie apocalypse or apocalypse of any kind.    
In this video contest, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] challenged contestants to upload videos to YouTube demonstrating how they are preparing for emergency situations such as [[flood]]s, earthquakes, hurricanes and zombie attacks.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

[[Image:recsam2.jpg|thumb|right|Regional Centre for Education in Science and Mathematics.]]
The '''Regional Centre for Education in Science and Mathematics (RECSAM)''' is a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] educational [[corporation]] headquartered in [[Penang, Malaysia]]. It is one of the founding sister centres of SEAMEO, the [[Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organisation]]. SEAMEO was established on 30 November 1965 as a chartered international organisation whose purpose is to promote co-operation in education, science and culture in the Southeast Asian region.

Since its inception in 1967, RECSAM has assisted in the principal development of educational manpower and served as a catalyst for the advancement of science and mathematics education at the primary and secondary school levels for its member countries, namely: [[Brunei Darussalam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos|Lao Peoples' Democratic Republic]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], [[Timor Leste]] and [[Vietnam]]. RECSAM has also been offering teachers and educators training opportunities to improve their skills and make them more adaptable to the changing educational environment.

To date, well over six thousand teachers and key educators have taken the Centre’s regular courses.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Training==

===Regular Courses===
Development of skills and knowledge of key teachers and educators of the Southeast Asia has been the core business of RECSAM. The Centre will continuously conduct regular courses for participants coming from 10 SEAMEO member countries. From FY2006/2007 the Centre hopes to receive participants from Timor Leste, a newly independent country who has joined SEAMEO. The Centre will conduct 27 regular courses in the coming three years. Each course will be of 4 week duration. The proposed training courses for the next three fiscal years are extracted from RECSAM's 8th Five Year Plan (FY 2005/2006 – 2009/2010). The topics and outlines of these projects have been identified through an elaborate process of reviewing current and future trends in science and mathematics education, the needs of SEAMEO Member Countries and prioritising them according to their importance.

===In-country Courses===
Besides regular courses, the Centre conducts in-country courses whereby the professionals from the Centre will train participants from the respective countries at their own country.

===Diploma and Masters Programme===
RECSAM started this programme in 2006 with [[Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia]] and the first batch of participants was from [[Bandung, Indonesia]]. This programme, a Post Graduate Certificate of Education in ICT leading to a Master of Education in IT &amp; Resource, takes 11 months to complete. This programme will be a twinned programme with [[Deakin University]] in [[Australia]].

===Customised Courses===
In 2005, a group of 5 [[Kenya]]n educators participated in our{{who|date=April 2012}} regular course as fee paying participants. Since the course was observed to be very relevant to them, the Centre was requested by JICA, the sponsor, to conduct more courses for the Kenyan. A contract with JICA has been signed to train the Kenyan educators for the next three years. In 2006, the Centre received 40 Kenyan educators to attend the customised courses. More customised course will be conducted if there is demand from local, regional and international participants. In 2007, another 40 Kenyan educators to attend customised courses for Math &amp; Science at the Center. However, for the Ugandans, a customised course was held for the Science group. In the beginning of 2008, participants from [[Aceh, Indonesia]] were here.

==Research and Development==
The Centre recognises that [[research and development]] is a critical area that needs to be addressed to enhance the quality and relevance of its training programmes. Research and Development Division undertakes various programmes and activities which are focused on Conduct of Research, Development of Resources, Dissemination and Review and Evaluation.

At most, two researches will be conducted a year which will include a classroom-based research and a long range research which may focus on policy formulation or towards the enhancement of teaching and learning of science and mathematics and integration of ICT. The possible research
topics are clustered along the following major areas:-
* Thinking and Meaningful Understanding in Science and Mathematics
* Classroom Learning Environment in Science and Mathematics
* Effective Teaching and Learning Strategies
* Assessing Teaching and Learning in Mathematics
* ICT in the Science and Mathematics Classrooms
* Impact and Evaluation Studies

To further enhance the relevance of its programme, RECSAM has also taken the initiative to promote Research and Development activities among students and also to encourage the setting up of Research and Development centres in the schools. Fourteen schools around Penang have been chosen to be partner schools in this programme. The MoU has been signed with the Education Department of Penang witnessed by the Principals, Headmasters or representatives of the respective schools.

==Commemoration ceremony of RECSAM's 40th Anniversary 2007==
[[Image:Officiating.jpg|thumb|right|H.E. Dato' Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein, Minister of Education Malaysia officiating the ceremony on 5 September 2007 with a student while looking on is the center director, Dr Azian T.S. Abdullah.]]
The theme song of the anniversary was titled '''SEAMEO RECSAM''', composed by '''Ahmad Ramli''' with lyrics written by '''Dr. Azian Abdullah''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27001">The '''Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study''' (SSMCIS) was the name of an American [[mathematics education]] program that stood for both the name of a curriculum and the name of the project that was responsible for developing curriculum materials. It is considered part of the second round of initiatives in the "[[New Math]]" movement of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="nyt-fehr-obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fey-1978"/&gt;  The program was led by Howard F. Fehr, a professor at [[Columbia University Teachers College]].

The program's signature goal was to create a unified treatment of mathematics and eliminate the traditional separate per-year studies of [[algebra]], [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], and so forth, that was typical of American secondary schools.&lt;ref name="walmsley"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of the 'New Mathematics' Movement and Its Relationship with Current Mathematical Reform | first=Angela Lynn Evans | last=Walmsley | publisher=[[University Press of America]] | location=Lanham, Maryland | year= 2003 | isbn=0-7618-2511-8 | pages=30, 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, the treatment unified those branches by studying fundamental concepts such as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], and [[Mapping (mathematics)|mappings]], and fundamental structures such as [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[Field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[vector space]]s.  The SSMCIS program produced six courses' worth of class material, intended for grades 7 through 12, in textbooks called '''''Unified Modern Mathematics'''''.  Some 25,000&amp;nbsp;students took SSMCIS courses nationwide during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==Background==
The program was led by Howard F. Fehr, a professor at [[Columbia University Teachers College]] who was internationally known and had published numerous mathematics textbooks and hundreds of articles about mathematics teaching.&lt;ref name="nyt-fehr-obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/07/obituaries/dr-howard-f-fehr-author-helped-start-system-of-new-math.html | title=Dr. Howard F. Fehr: Author Helped Start System of New Math | first=Walter H. | last=Waggoner | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 7, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1961 he had been the principal author of the 246-page report "New Thinking in School Mathematics", which held that [[traditional mathematics|traditional teaching of mathematics]] approaches did not meet the needs of the new technical society being entered into or of the current language of mathematicians and scientists.&lt;ref name="nyt-fehr-obit"/&gt;  Fehr considered the separation of mathematical study into separate years of distinct subjects to be an American failing that followed an educational model two hundred years old.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

The new curriculum was inspired by the seminar reports from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] in the early 1960s&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt; and by the [[Cambridge Conference on School Mathematics]] (1963),  which also inspired the [[Comprehensive School Mathematics Program]].&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mathcurriculumcenter.org/PDFS/CCM/summaries/cambridge_summary.pdf | title=Goals for School Mathematics | publisher=Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum | year=2004 | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were some interactions among these initiatives in the early stages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imacs.org/imacsadmin/parser?pageid=37 | title=Burt Kaufman | publisher=Institute for Mathematics &amp; Computer Science | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of SSMCIS was part of a general wave of cooperation in the mathematics education reform movement between Europe and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icmihistory.unito.it/portrait/steiner.php | title=The first century of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (1908–2008) – History of ICMI – Hans Georg Steiner | first=Gert | last=Schubring  | publisher=[[University of Turin]] | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum ==
{{Quote box|width=27%|align=right|quote="The construction is to be free of any restrictions of traditional content or sequence."|source=&lt;small&gt;—From the initial announcement of the curriculum work of the SSMCIS &lt;ref name="fehr-1966"&gt;{{cite journal | first=H.

Work on the SSMCIS program began in 1965&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt; and took place mainly at Teachers College.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Fehr was the director of the project from 1965 to 1973.&lt;ref name="nyt-fehr-obit"/&gt;  The principal consultants in the initial stages and subsequent yearly planning sessions were [[Marshall H. Stone]] of the [[University of Chicago]], [[Albert W. Tucker]] of [[Princeton University]], [[Edgar Lorch]] of [[Columbia University]], and Meyer Jordan of [[Brooklyn College]].&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Howard F. | last=Fehr | title=The Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study: A Unified Mathematics Program | journal=The Mathematics Teacher | volume=67 | issue=1 |date=January 1974 | pages=25–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program was targeted at the junior high and high school level and the 15–20&amp;nbsp;percent best students in a grade.&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;

Funding for the initiative began with the U.S. [[Office of Education]] and covered the development first three courses produced; the last three courses produced, as well as teacher training, were funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and by Teachers College itself.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;&lt;ref name="umm-v-ii"/&gt; The scope and sequence of the curriculum was developed by eighteen mathematicians from the U.S. and Europe in 1966 and subsequently refined in experimental course material by mathematical educators with high school level teaching experience.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"&gt;{{cite journal | first=H. F. | last=Fehr | first2=James | last2=Fey | title=The Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study | journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume=76 | issue=10 |date=December 1969 | pages=1132–1137 | doi=10.2307/2317192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1971, some thirty-eight contributors to course materials were identified, eight from Teachers College, four from Europe, one from Canada, and the rest from various other universities (and a couple of high schools) in the United States.&lt;ref name="umm-v-ii"/&gt;  Fehr did not do much curriculum development himself, but rather recruited and led the others and organized the whole process.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-79"&gt;Howson, Keitel, and Kilpatrick, ''Curriculum Development in Mathematics'', pp. 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  Graduate students from the Department of Mathematical Education at Teachers College also served each year in various capacities on the SSMCIS program.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;

The central idea of the program was to organize mathematics not by algebra, geometry, etc., but rather to unify those branches by studying the fundamental concepts of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], and [[Mapping (mathematics)|mappings]], and fundamental structures such as [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[Field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[vector space]]s.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Other terms used for this approach included "global" or "integrated";&lt;ref name="lhs-cos"/&gt; Fehr himself spoke of a "spiral" or "helical" development, and wrote of "the spirit of global organization that is at the heart of the SSMCIS curriculum – important mathematical systems unified by a core of fundamental concepts and structures common to all.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;

For example, as the courses progressed, the concept of mappings were used to describe, and visually illustrate, the traditionally disparate topics of [[Translation (geometry)|translation]], [[Reflection (mathematics)|line reflection]], [[Probability space|probability of an event]], [[trigonometric functions]], [[isomorphism]] and [[complex number]]s, and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[Linear map|linear mappings]].&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;  Traditional subjects were broken up, such that the course material for each year included some material related to algebra, some to geometry, and so forth.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;&lt;!-- TODO ... more descr and examples --&gt;

Even when abstract concepts were being introduced, they were introduced in concrete, intuitive forms, especially at the younger levels.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Logical proofs were introduced early on and built in importance as the years developed.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  At least one year of university-level mathematics education was incorporated into the later courses.&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;  Solving traditional applications problems was de-emphasized, especially in the earlier courses, but the intent of the project was to make up for that with its focus on real numbers in measurements, computer programming, and probability and statistics.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  In particular, the last of these was a pronounced element of SSMCIS, with substantial material on it present in all six courses, from measures of [[statistical dispersion]] to [[combinatorics]] to [[Bayes' theorem]] and more.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

The curriculum that SSMCIS devised had influences from earlier reform work in Europe,&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt; going back to the [[Bourbaki group]]'s work in France in the 1930s and the ''Synopses for Modern Secondary School Mathematics'' published in Paris in 1961.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Indeed, most European secondary schools were teaching a more integrated approach.&lt;ref name="nys-integrated"/&gt;  Also, this was one of several American efforts to address a particularly controversial issue, the teaching of a full year of [[Euclidean geometry]] in secondary school.&lt;ref name="acmdl"&gt;{{cite conference | first=Joseph K. | last=McAdams | first2=Arlan R. |last2=DeKock | title=Computer graphics as an aid to teaching geometric transformations | conference=SIGCSE '76 Proceedings of the ACM SIGCSE-SIGCUE Technical Symposium on Computer Science and Education | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] | location=New York | &lt;!-- doi=10.1145/800107.803463 --&gt; | pages=137–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like many of the others, it did this by teaching [[Transformation geometry|geometric transformations]] as a unifying approach between algebra and geometry.&lt;ref name="acmdl"/&gt;  

Regardless of all these influences and other projects, the SSMCIS study group considered its work unique in scope and breadth, and Fehr wrote that "nowhere [else] had a total 7–12 unified mathematics program been designed, produced, and tested."&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  It was thus considered one of the more radical of the reform efforts lumped under the "New Math" label.&lt;ref name="kline"&gt;{{cite book | first=Morris | last=Kline | authorlink=Morris Kline | title=Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math | publisher=[[Vintage Books]] | location= | year=1974 | isbn=0394719816 | at=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Fehr believed that the SSMCIS could not just improve students' thinking in mathematics, but in all subjects, by "develop[ing] the capacity of the human mind for the observation, selection, generalization, abstraction, and construction of models for use in the other disciplines."&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

==Materials==
[[Image:Unified Modern Mathematics Course III Part 1 cover.jpg|thumb|223px|right|upright|The paper covers of the course books had a different color for each of the six courses: light blue, yellow, light green (here), red, blue, dark red.]]

The course books put out by SSMCIS were titled ''Unified Modern Mathematics'', and labeled as Course I through Course VI, with the two volumes in each year labeled as Part I and Part II.&lt;ref name="umm-v-ii"&gt;{{cite book | title=Unified Modern Mathematics: Course V: Part II | publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University]] | location=New York | edition=Revised | year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Materials for the next year's course were prepared each year, thus keeping up with the early adoption programs underway.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Using largely [[formative evaluation]] methods for gaining teacher feedback,&lt;ref name="curdev-math-196"/&gt; revised versions were put out after the first year's teaching experience.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;  By 1973, the revised version of all six courses had been completed.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"&gt;{{cite book | title=Curriculum Development in Mathematics | type=Paperback | first=Geoffrey |last=Howson |first2=Christine |last2=Keitel |first3= Jeremy |last3=Kilpatrick | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | location= | year=1982 | pages=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first three volumes were put into the public domain for any organization to use.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

The pages of the books were formatted by typewriter, augmented by some mathematical symbols and inserted graphs, bound in paper, and published by Teachers College itself.&lt;ref name="umm-v-ii"/&gt; A more polished hardcover version of Courses I through IV was put out in subsequent years by [[Addison-Wesley]]; these were adaptations made by Fehr and others and targeted to students with a broader range of mathematical ability.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;

[[Computer programming]] on [[Time-sharing|time-shared computer systems]] was included in the curriculum both for its own importance and for understanding numerical methods.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  The first course introduced [[flow chart]]s and the notion of [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref name="umm-i-ii"&gt;{{cite book | title=Unified Modern Mathematics: Course I: Part II | publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University]] | location=New York | edition=Revised | year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The beginning portion of the fourth-year course was devoted to introducing the [[BASIC]] programming language, with an emphasis on fundamental [[control flow]] statements, continued use of flow charts for design, and [[numerical programming]] applications.  Interactive teletype interfaces on slow and erratic [[dial-up modem|dial-up connections]], with troublesome [[paper tape]] for offline storage, was the typical physical environment.&lt;ref name="umm-iv-i"&gt;{{cite book | title=Unified Modern Mathematics: Course IV: Part I | publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University]] | location=New York | edition=Revised | year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption==
Starting in 1966, teachers from nine junior high and high schools, mostly in the [[New York metropolitan area]], began getting training in the study program at Teachers College.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Such training was crucial since few junior high or high school teachers knew all the material that would be introduced.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-79"/&gt;  They then returned to their  schools and began teaching the experimental courses,&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt; two teachers per grade.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;    For instance, [[Leonia High School]], which incorporated grades 8–12 (since there was no middle school then), called the program "Math X" for experimental, with individual courses called Math 8X, Math 9X, etc.&lt;ref name="lhs-cos"&gt;{{cite book | title=Program of Studies: 1970–1971 | publisher=[[Leonia High School]] | location=Leonia, New Jersey | year=1970 | page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hunter College High School]] used it as the basis for its Extended Honors Program; the school's description stated that the program "includes many advanced topics and requires extensive preparation and a considerable commitment of time to the study of mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hchs.hunter.cuny.edu/images/uploads/CourseOutline_Math7.pdf | title=Mathematics: Departmental Philosophy | publisher=[[Hunter College High School]] | accessdate=September 13, 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Students were periodically given standardized tests to make sure there was no decline in performance due to the unusual organization of material.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Some 400&amp;nbsp;students were involved in this initial phase.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

Because the program was so different from standard U.S. mathematics curricula, it was quite difficult to students to enter after the first year; students did, however, sometimes drop out of it and return to standard courses.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;  As teaching the program was a specialized activity, teachers tended to move along from each grade to the next with their students, and so it was typical for students to have one of the same two teachers, or even the same teacher, for five or six years in a row.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;
  
More teachers were added in 1968 and 1969 and the [[University of Maryland]] and [[University of Arizona]] were added as teaching sites.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Eighteen schools in [[Los Angeles]] adopted SSMCIS in what was called the Accelerated Mathematics Instruction program; some 2,500&amp;nbsp;gifted students took part.&lt;ref name="la-ami"&gt;{{cite journal | title=New Programs | first=Robert J. | last=Kansky | first2=Arthur A. | last2=Hiatt | first3=Mary Margaret |last3=Odom | journal=
The Mathematics Teacher | volume=67 | issue= 8 |date=December 1974 | page= 729}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1971, teacher education programs were being conducted in places like [[Austin Peay State University]] in [[Tennessee]], which was attended by junior high school teachers from seventeen states and one foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KONHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=F4AMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4830,1672755 | title=Math Teacher Taking Course | newspaper=[[The Victoria Advocate]] | location=Victoria, Texas | date=August 10, 1971 | page=3A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- also https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1WNhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xKAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1868,5399869 but seems like a pretty confused account --&gt;  By 1974, Fehr stated that 25,000&amp;nbsp;students were taking SSMCIS courses across the U.S.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

==Results==
[[Image:Unified Modern Mathematics Course 1 Teachers Commentary cover.jpg|thumb|175px|right|upright|Teacher's guides were also available for SSMCIS.]]

The Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study program did show some success in its educational purpose.&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;  A study of the Los Angeles program found that SSMCIS-taught students had a better attitude toward their program than did students using [[School Mathematics Study Group]] courses (another "New Math" initiative) or traditional courses.&lt;ref name="la-ami"/&gt;  In [[New York State]] schools, special examinations were given to tenth and eleventh grade SSMCIS students in lieu of the standard [[Regents Examinations]]&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt; due to a mismatch in curriculum.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-196"&gt;Howson, Keitel, and Kilpatrick, ''Curriculum Development in Mathematics'', pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; However, SSMCIS was one of the direct inspirations for the [[New York State Education Department]], in the late 1970s and 1980s, adopting an integrated, three-year mathematics curriculum for all its students, combining algebra, geometry, and trigonometry with an increased emphasis in probability and statistics.&lt;ref name="nys-integrated"&gt;{{cite journal | title=An Integrated Approach for Secondary School Mathematics | first=Fredric | last=Paul | journal=[[The Mathematics Teacher]] | volume= 79 | issue= 4 |date=April 1986 | pages= 236–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;

Given the differences in subject matter and approach, how SSMCIS-taught students would perform on [[College Entrance Examination Board]] tests became a major concern of parents and students and teachers.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-196"/&gt;  A 1973 report compared the test performance of such students with those from traditional mathematics curricula.  It found that the SSMCIS students did better on the mathematics portion of the [[PSAT/NMSQT|Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT)]], even when matched for background and performance on the verbal portion. It also found that SSMCIS students did just as well on the [[SAT Subject Test in Mathematics Level 2|Mathematics Level II Achievement Test]] as traditional students taking college preparatory courses or, indeed, as college freshmen taking introductory calculus courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED081847 | title=Performance of SSMCIS-Trained Students on College Board Mathematics Examinations | last=Williams | first=S. Irene | last2= Jones | first2=Chancey O. | publisher=Test Development Report | year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study found SSMCIS students well prepared for the mathematics portion of the regular [[SAT|Scholastic Aptitude Test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=An Overview of the Mathematics Achievement Tests Offered in the Admissions Testing Program of the College Entrance Examination Board | first=Chancey O. | last=Jones | first2=Mildred R. | last2=Rowen | first3=Howard E. | last3=Taylor | journal=The Mathematics Teacher | volume=70 | issue= 3 |date=March 1977 | pages= 197–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, SSMCIS developed slowly.&lt;ref name="kline"/&gt; Funding became an issue,&lt;ref name="record"/&gt; and indeed it was never funded as well as some other mathematics curriculum efforts had been.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;  Despite the federal funding source, there was no centralized, national focal point in the U.S. for curriculum changes – such as some European countries had – and that made adoption of SSMCIS innovations a harder task.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-45"&gt;Howson, Keitel, and Kilpatrick, ''Curriculum Development in Mathematics'', pp. 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-1970s there was a growing backlash against the "New Math" movement, spurred in part by a perceived decline in standardized test scores and by [[Morris Kline]]'s critical book ''Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math''.&lt;ref name="fey-1978"&gt;{{cite journal | first=James T. | last=Fey | title=Change in Mathematics Education Since the Late 1950's – Ideas and Realisation U.S.A. | journal=[[Educational Studies in Mathematics]] | volume=9 | issue=3 |date=August 1978 | pages=339–353 | doi=10.1007/bf00241036}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many reform efforts had underestimated the difficulty of getting the public and the mathematics educational community to believe that major changes were really necessary, especially for secondary school programs where college entrance performance was always the key concern of administrators.&lt;ref name="fey-1978"/&gt;  Federal funding for curriculum development also came under attack from [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] in the [[U.S. Congress]].&lt;ref name="fey-1978"/&gt;  As one of the participants in creating SSMCIS, James T. Fey of Teachers College, later wrote, "Schools and societal expectations of schools appear to change very slowly."&lt;ref name="fey-1978"/&gt;  In the end, SSMCIS never became widely adopted.&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;

==Legacy==
One SSMCIS student, [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] of [[Leonia High School]], decades later became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Estonia)|Foreign Minister]] and then [[President of Estonia]].&lt;ref name="nj2016"/&gt;  He credited the SSMCIS course, the early exposure it gave him to computer programming, and the teacher of the course, Christine Cummings, with his subsequent interest in computer infrastructure, which in part resulted in the country leaping over its [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era technological backwardness; computer-accessible education became pervasive in [[Education in Estonia|Estonian schools]], and the [[Internet in Estonia]] has one of the highest penetration rates in the world.&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.president.ee/en/media/interviews/3304-qfrom-estonia-to-leoniaq-the-record-23-april-2008/ | title=From Estonia to Leonia | first=Herb | last=Jackson | newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]] | location = | date=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.riponsociety.org/forum131thi.htm | title=The Estonian Example: Q&amp;A with Toomas Hendrik Ilves | work=[[The Ripon Forum]] | publisher=[[Ripon Society]] | date=Winter 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As his tenure as president came to a close in 2016, Ilves visited his old school building with Cummings and said, "I owe everything to her. Because of what she taught us, my country now uses it."&lt;ref name="nj2016"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2016/09/president_of_estonia_visits_his_old_nj_high_school_before_un_talk.html | title=President of Estonia visits his old N.J. high school before UN talk | first=Sara | last=Jerde | publisher=[[NJ.com]] | date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cummings said that SSMCIS not only introduced beginning computer programming but also taught students "how to think".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/estonian-president-a-leonia-h-s-grad-stops-by-middle-school-1.1663775 | title=Estonian president, a Leonia H.S. grad, stops by middle school | first=Andrew | last=Wyrich | newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]] | date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSMCIS did represent a productive exercise in thinking about mathematics curriculum, and the mathematics education literature would cite it in subsequent years, including references to it as a distinct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Review: Geometry in the Mathematics Curriculum, Thirty-sixth Yearbook | first=James D. | last=Bristol |journal=The Mathematics Teacher | volume= 67 | issue= 5 |date=May 1974 | page= 442}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most radical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=What Do Mathematics Teachers Think About the High School Geometry Controversy | first=George | last=Gearhart | journal=The Mathematics Teacher | volume= 68 | issue= 6 |date=October 1975 | pages= 486–493}}&lt;/ref&gt; approach to teaching geometry; as using functions as a unifying element of teaching mathematics;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Intuitions on Functions | first=Tommy |last=Dreyfus | first2=Theodore |last2=Eisenberg | journal=The Journal of Experimental Education | volume= 52 | issue= 2 | date=Winter 1984 | pages= 77-85}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as its course materials having value when used as the vehicle for further research in mathematics education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Communication of Mathematical Structure and Its Relationship to Achievement | first=Nicholas A. |last=Branca|journal=[[Journal for Research in Mathematics Education]] | volume=11 | issue= 1 |date=January 1980 | pages= 37–49 | doi=10.2307/748731}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Two mentions in here, maybe some legacy stuff, maybe not: books.google.com/books?id=8FTKCaDjhZ0C&amp;pg=PA512 --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4703">'''Symbolic boundaries''' are a theory of how people form social groups proposed by [[cultural sociology|cultural sociologists]].
Symbolic boundaries are “conceptual distinctions made by social actors…that separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership.”&lt;ref name=LamontMolnar2002&gt;[[Michele Lamont|Lamont, Michele]] and Virag Molnar. 2002. "The Study of Boundaries in the Social Sciences" Annual Review of Sociology. 28:167-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic boundaries are a necessary but insufficient condition for social change. Only when symbolic boundaries are widely agreed upon can they take on a constraining character and become social boundaries.&lt;ref name=LamontMolnar2002/&gt;

==Durkheim==

[[Émile Durkheim]] saw the symbolic boundary between sacred and profane as the most profound of all social facts, and the one from which lesser symbolic boundaries were derived.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971[1915]) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ritual]]s - secular or religious - were for Durkheim the means by which groups maintained their symbolic/moral boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Allen, ''Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory'' (2009) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mary Douglas]] has subsequently emphasised the role of symbolic boundaries in organising experience, private and public, even in a secular society;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Douglas, ''Natural Symbols'' (2002) p. 50-1&lt;/ref&gt; while other neo-Durkheimians highlight the role of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviancy]] as one of revealing and making plain the symbolic boundaries that uphold moral order, and of providing an opportunity for  their communal reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Annalee R. Ward, '' Mouse Morality'' (2002) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; As Durkheim himself put it, "Crime brings together upright consciences and concentrates them...to talk of the event and wax indignant in common",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Worsley ed., ''The New Modern Sociology Readings'' (1991) p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; thereby reaffirming the collective barriers that have been breached.

==Transgressing boundaries==

[[Prejudice]] is often the result of crossing the symbolic boundaries that preserve a group's sense of itself - boundaries that as with a nation's frontiers may in fact be real as well as symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cunningham, ''Prejudice'' (2000) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; (The ancient ceremony of [[beating the bounds]] highlights that overlapping of real and symbolic bounds).&lt;ref&gt;[[François Laroque]], ''Shakespeare's Festive World'' (1991) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salman Rushdie]] has emphasised the role of the migrant as a [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] representative, transgressing symbolic boundaries, and (potentially at least) demonised by their upholders in the host nation as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Salman Rushdie, ''Imaginary Homelands'' (1991) p. 278-9 and p. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marjorie Garber]] has explored the role of the [[Transvestism|transvestite]] in crossing the symbolic boundaries of gender - something which she considered tended to challenge those of race as well.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolic/social boundaries==

Symbolic boundaries are distinct from “social boundaries" that are "objectified forms of social differences manifested in unequal access to an unequal distribution of resources… and social opportunities.”&lt;ref name=LamontMolnar2002/&gt;

==Play==

[[Play (activity)|Playing]] may be seen as a way of testing social boundaries - the unspoken [[Frame analysis|frames]] set about social activities.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Bloustien, ''Girl Making'' (2003) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Humour too provides a way of illuminating, testing and perhaps also shifting symbolic boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;P. Morey/A. Yaqin, ''Framing Muslims'' (2011) p. 199-204&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

* [[Michael Jackson]], in Garber's opinion, erases and detraumatises not only the boundaries between male and female, youth and age, but also between black and white internalising cultural category crises.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Phillips, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The 3rd Degree''''' (sometimes written as '''''The Third Degree''''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[quiz show]] broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]], hosted by [[comedian]] [[Steve Punt]] and made by [[Pozzitive Television|Pozzitive Productions]]. The series is recorded at different [[Universities in the United Kingdom|universities]] around the country, the contestants all coming from the university in which the recording takes place. One teams consists of three students and the other of three lecturers (known as the "[[University don|Dons]]") who teach the subjects the students are studying. 

==Format==
The show consists of several rounds which are as follows:&lt;ref name="UKGameshows review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weaver|first=Iain|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Weaver%27s_Week_2011-05-08|title=Weaver's Week 2011-05-08|publisher=UKGameshows|date=8 May 2011|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The General Knowledge Round''': Each team are asked [[general knowledge]] questions in turn, which they are allowed to confer on. If they get the question right, they score two points. If they get it wrong the question is thrown over to the other team for a bonus point.
* '''Specialist Subject Round 1''': The first of three specialist subject rounds. The rounds are between one student and the Don who teaches them. The questions are on the academic subject that the student is learning and the Don teaches. The scoring is [[Asymmetry|asymmetric]] in favour of the student. Correct answers score two points. If a Don gets a question wrong it can go over for a bonus point to the student, but if a student gets a question wrong no bonus is given.
* '''The List Round''': Each team is given 30 seconds to list as many things in a given category (time begins after Punt finishes reading the question). One point is given for each correct answer (indicated by a "ping" sound effect). If eight correct answers are given in the time limit, a ninth bonus point is awarded.
* '''Specialist Subject Round 2''': The second specialist subject round. Follows the same format as the first.
* '''Highbrow Lowbrow''': Referred to by some as the show's "Signature round",&lt;ref name="UKGameshows review"/&gt; here each contestant is given a short clue to a question and are then asked if they want to answer a [[highbrow]] or a [[Low culture|lowbrow]] question based on the clue. The students score two points if they get the highbrow question right or one point if they get the lowbrow question right. For the Dons, it is the other way around (one point for highbrow, two points for lowbrow). When the contestant chooses the question, their academic rival has to answer the question not chosen.
* '''Specialist Subject Round 3''': The third and final specialist subject round. Follows the same format as the others.
* '''The Quick Fire Round''': The final general knowledge "bell and buzzer" round (the students have a bell, the Dons have a buzzer). Correct answers score one point. Incorrect interruptions lose one point. Questions are not thrown over to the other side.

==Reception==
Reviews for ''The 3rd Degree'' have been mixed. Iain Weaver from UKGameshows gave a positive review of the series, saying: "We're not tremendously upset by the way the teachers went through the series unbeaten, they ''are'' university lecturers, and university lecturers are meant to know an awful lot. We also liked the way Steve Punt kept the programme flowing at a decent pace, adding jokes and asides, and keeping proceedings moving along most enjoyably. He's probably helped by the audience at the student bar, who have doubtlessly taken this opportunity to have their one pint of something for the week. If there's one slight criticism we'd make, it's that the Highbrow Lowbrow round is a bit of a block in the middle of the programme. We might prefer to split the round into two parts, perhaps shifting the first immediately before the lists round. That would add a little bit more variety, and make the programme a little less imposing. That's just a minor criticism: most of what ''The 3rd Degree'' does, it does well. Given that it replaced the venerable ''[[Quote... Unquote]]'', it didn't have a high bar, but we can see this programme running for a fair few years."&lt;ref name="UKGameshows review"/&gt;

Elisabeth Mahoney was negative in her summing up writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "There are lots of rather lukewarm, predictable asides like this between rounds that rarely move beyond mildly distracting. You can imagine that on paper, this looked like a really swell idea: the reality on-air lacks pace and excitement, and you know the dons will win. It's a bit foggy in places, too, with a mysterious regime of bonus points available at some times and not others, and it can be hard to remember, by first name, who is on which side of the academic divide... There are a few amusing moments like this, but ultimately it's all a bit soulless and you don't really care who wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mahoney|first=Elisabeth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/mar/01/the-third-degree-review|title=Radio review: The Third Degree|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=1 March 2011|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derek Smith in ''[[The Stage]]'' gave a mixed review saying the show was: "A kind of dysfunctional radio version of ''[[University Challenge]]''. My question would be - what's the point? Admittedly, it's quite lively, but only vaguely funny, and hardly dynamic. Third-class degree, more like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Derek|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/31335/radio-review-light-programme|title=Radio review - light programme|publisher=''[[The Stage]]''|date=18 February 2011|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
In 2015 ''The 3rd Degree'' was nominated for the [[Rose d'Or]] in the "Radio Game Show" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosedor.com/news.html#article-6|title=Rose d'Or nominees announced with more master class speakers|publisher=[[Rose d'Or]]|date=9 November 2015|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roles were played by Dr. Frank Baxter and Eddie Albert, respectively. |alt=Photograph of two men standing.

'''The Bell System Science Series''' consists of nine television specials made for the [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] that were originally broadcast in color between 1956 and 1964. Marcel LaFollette has described them as "specials that combined clever story lines, sophisticated animation, veteran character actors, films of natural phenomena, interviews with scientists, and precise explanation of scientific and technical concepts — all in the pursuit of better public understanding of science."&lt;ref name=LaFollette /&gt; Geoff Alexander and [[Rick Prelinger]] have described the films as "among the best known and remembered educational films ever made, and enthroning Dr. Frank Baxter, professor at the University of Southern California, as something of a legend as the omniscient king of academic science films hosts."&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;

AT&amp;T and its subsidiary Bell Telephone System had a history of sponsoring broadcasting such as the ''[[Bell Telephone Hour]]'', which was a weekly radio program of classical and Broadway music.  AT&amp;T's advertising agency, [[N. W. Ayer &amp; Son]], suggested that they also sponsor "television specials aimed at family audiences. Science was a natural topic choice, given the accomplishments and reputation of the company’s research arm, [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]]."&lt;ref name=LaFollette /&gt; They ultimately approached the famed filmmaker [[Frank Capra]], who had numerous nominations and wins for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] in the 1930s and 40s for films such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946). Capra produced the four films that were televised from 1956–1958. The second four films were produced by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], with veteran filmmaker Owen Crump in charge; these were televised between 1958 and 1962. The final film was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], and televised in 1964.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt; Each special explored a single subject in detail. The host for the first eight films was [[Frank C. Baxter|Dr. Frank C. Baxter]], a USC professor of English and television personality who played the role of "Dr. Research" (or "Dr. Linguistics" in ''The Alphabet Conspiracy''). The host for the last film in the series was [[Walt Disney]].

Following their television broadcast, the films were made available at minimal cost for classroom use. J. B. Gilbert estimated that, by the mid 1960s, the films had been watched by 5 million schoolchildren and half a million college students"; about 1600 copies of the film were ultimately distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the films have been released for home video.

LaFollette notes that, "Production approaches that are now standard practice on ''[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]'' and the [[Discovery Channel]] derive, in fact, from experimentation by television pioneers like [[Lynn Poole]] and [[Don Herbert]] and such programs as ''[[Adventure (TV series)|Adventure]]'', ''[[Zoo Parade]]'', ''[[Science in Action (TV series)|Science in Action]]'', and the Bell Telephone System’s science specials. These early efforts were also influenced by television’s love of the dramatic, refined during its first decade and continuing to shape news and public affairs programming, as well as fiction and fantasy, today."&lt;ref name=LaFollette /&gt;

==The Capra films==
The first four films of the series were produced and written by [[Frank Capra]] from 1952–1956. As described by biographer [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]], Capra had retired from feature filmmaking by 1952, due in part to the turmoil of the [[Hollywood Blacklist]] era. McBride writes that Capra "undoubtedly realized that the AT&amp;T job was a way of going back to work quietly and rehabilitating his image."&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt; Matthew Gunter compares Capra's involvement with the Bell series to his work on wartime propaganda and training films, "As in the creation of the war documentaries, Capra dove into the work and rediscovered his passion for the filmmaking process. Like his work on the war films, he employed found footage and animation to verify, illustrate, and document what was being said in the voice-over narration."&lt;ref name=Gunter /&gt; Capra later described the films, "Those four films about science, hand woven with bits of celluloid, were sprightly patterns of poesy and fact; fresh ideas were their main charm, a rather elegant charm, we thought, much like the light-hearted but disciplined charm of a Mozart composition."&lt;ref name=Capra /&gt; After the Bell series, Capra returned to feature films as the director of ''[[A Hole in the Head]]'' (1959).

===Screenplays and religious elements===
[[File:OurMrSun-Psalms.jpg|thumb|right |300px |Screenshot from the beginning of ''Our Mr. Sun'' showing a quotation from the Bible. |alt=The quotation "The Heavens Declare the Glory of God" and credit "Psalms" are overlaid against a photograph of an orange sky and clouds; there is a dark hillside sloping across the bottom right of the photograph.

[[File:UnchainedGoddessScreenshot1.jpg|thumb |right |300px |An animation in ''The Unchained Goddess'' shows tourists in a glass-bottomed boat viewing the flooded remains of Miami after melting of the polar icecaps. The animation illustrates a possible consequence of [[global warming]]. |alt=Cartoon showing a boat with about nine people in it floating on water. Submerged beneath the boat are a house, a palm tree, and power lines. There is also a school of swimming fish in the water beneath the boat.]]
From the beginning of the project, Capra had insisted that the films would explore the relationship of science and religion. In his autobiography, Capra paraphrased his early comments to a meeting of the scientific advisory board assembled by AT&amp;T and N. W. Ayer, "If I make a science film, I will have to say that science research is just another expression of the Holy Spirit that works in ''all'' men. Furthermore, I will say that science, in essence, is just another facet of man's quest for God."&lt;ref name=Capra /&gt; At a later stage in the project, Capra wrote that the films would have "the obligation to stress or at the very least to acknowledge the spiritual side of man's make-up — to acknowledge that all good things come from God — including science."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capra's screenplays called for two principal characters, "Dr. Research" and "Mr. Fiction Writer", who would interact both with each other and with animated characters specific to each film. Dr. Research mainly explains scientific matters. Matthew Gunter adds that the Fiction Writer "possesses many of the characteristics of the heroes in earlier Capra films. ... Mr. Writer also acts like the audience's surrogate, often expressing a healthy skepticism or disbelief about the facts Dr. Research presents, asking questions to the scientist, and translating his technical verbiage into the language of the common people."&lt;ref name=Gunter /&gt;

The religious elements in the screenplays occasioned much discussion and some acrimony with the scientific advisory board and consultants such as [[Donald Menzel]], but many were finally incorporated. James Gilbert has written, "When finally produced, ''Our Mr. Sun'' included a mixture of science, documentary footage, low-key advertising, and animation contained within a religious-magical framework. ... Most striking, ''Our Mr. Sun'' began and ended with inescapable religious allusions."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Gunter writes, "in these films, Capra tries to create a common ground between science and religion — both are ways for the optimistic and the curious to think about the world and our place in it."&lt;ref name=Gunter /&gt;

===Casting and production===
For Dr. Research, Capra selected [[Frank C. Baxter|Dr. Frank C. Baxter]]. Baxter was a professor of English at the [[University of Southern California]] who enjoyed great success as the host of ''Shakespeare on TV'' at about the same time as the Bell series was being made, and who won a [[Peabody Award]] in 1955. Baxter hosted many educational television programs in the 1950s, although perhaps none were as influential as the eight Bell series programs. He became "a full-fledged personality of the TV age — plain-spoken, not without humor and decidedly avuncular."&lt;ref name=Stewart /&gt; The role of Mr. Fiction Writer was played by [[Eddie Albert]] in the first film, and by [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]] in the next three. While Baxter and his role as Dr. Research continued into the Warner films, The Fiction Writer disappeared.

The films were done in [[Technicolor]], and marked Capra's first use of color in filmmaking.&lt;ref name=Gunter /&gt; Cartoon animation was an important feature; the animated characters in the films interact directly with the live-action characters, which was an innovation at the time. Capra worked with [[United Productions of America]] (UPA) for the first film, ''Our Mr. Sun''. At UPA, [[William T. Hurtz|Bill Hurtz]] directed the animation for ''Our Mr. Sun''; Hurtz had been the designer for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Oscar-winning]] cartoon short of [[Dr. Seuss]]' ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (1950). In 1954, Hurtz moved to [[Shamus Culhane|Shamus Culhane Productions]], and the animation contract for the next three Capra films followed him there.&lt;ref name=Poague /&gt;&lt;ref name=Solomon /&gt;

[[Harold E. Wellman]] was the cinematographer for the films; Wellman won an [[Emmy Award]] (Best Cinematography for Television) for the second film in the series, ''Hemo the Magnificent''. All four films were edited by [[Frank P. Keller]], who won an [[Emmy Award]] (Best Editing Of A Film For Television) for the first, ''Our Mr. Sun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Primetime Emmy Award Database |publisher=Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences |url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=Frank+Keller&amp;program=&amp;start_year=1949&amp;end_year=2010&amp;network=All&amp;web_category=All&amp;winner=All }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keller worked with Capra at the beginning of his career; he subsequently became a prominent feature film editor, and won the [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing]] for ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968).

===''Our Mr. Sun'' (1956)===
{{Main|Our Mr. Sun}}
''[[Our Mr. Sun]]'' examines the Sun and how it works, the Sun's profound influence on life on earth, and the possibilities for harnessing sunlight for solar electricity; solar cells had been demonstrated at Bell Laboratories in 1954 during the development of the film. For the screenplay, Capra first contracted for treatments by two prominent authors, [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Willy Ley]]. Ultimately, Capra wrote the screenplay himself, subject to approval by a scientific advisory board put together by N. W. Ayer. The principal scientific source used for the screenplay was the book ''Our Sun'' (1949) by [[Donald Howard Menzel|Donald Menzel]], who also consulted with Capra about the screenplay. Menzel opposed most of the religious elements of Capra's screenplay, but many were included in the version that was produced.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, pp. 204–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film starred [[Eddie Albert]] and [[Lionel Barrymore]], as the Fiction Writer and as the voice of [[Father Time]], respectively. The film was Barrymore's last screen role, and was broadcast two years after the actor's death. It introduced [[Frank C. Baxter]] as Dr. Research; Baxter played this role in the next seven films in the series. [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]] voiced [[Sun|The Sun]]. [[Sterling Holloway]] had a smaller part (uncredited) voicing [[chlorophyll|Chloro Phyll]].

The film was first broadcast on November 19, 1956 at 10 PM to an audience estimated at 24 million viewers in the US and Canada, which was considered very successful at the time. Critical reaction was also favorable, and production of the next three films was authorized by AT&amp;T and N. W. Ayer.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hemo the Magnificent'' (1957)===
''[[Hemo the Magnificent]]'' is an examination of what the [[circulatory system]] is and how it works.  It was written and directed by Frank Capra, and starred Frank C. Baxter as Dr. Research, [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]] as the Fiction Writer, [[Mel Blanc]] as the squirrel, [[June Foray]] as the deer, and [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]] as [[Hemoglobin|Hemo]].

This film was first broadcast on March 20, 1957 at 9 PM. This was a better hour for a family program than used for ''Our Mr. Sun'', and the program had more viewers than those being broadcast on the two other major television networks.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays'' (1957)===
''The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays'' is an examination of what [[cosmic rays]] are and how they work. It was written by Capra with [[Jonathan Latimer]], a crime fiction novelist and screenwriter. As Gilbert describes it, the third and fourth films "repeated the formulas of his earlier work while ever searching for new contrivances for popularization as well as the best language to express his soft religious message" and that the script was essentially a reworking of ideas Capra had developed for a possible documentary about [[Robert A. Millikan]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The film's screenplay works from the premise that the nature of cosmic rays is a mystery comparable to the great detective stories. A committee of marionettes representing Fyodor Dostoevsky, Charles Dickens, and Edgar Allan Poe is called upon to decide the question. The film was broadcast on October 25, 1957, apparently with a smaller television audience share and with more unfavorable reviews than for the first two specials.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Unchained Goddess'' (1958)===
''The Unchained Goddess'' examines what [[weather]] is and how it works.  &lt;ref&gt;The actual film https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqClSPWVnNE&amp;t=53s&lt;/ref&gt; It was the fourth and last film in the series that was produced by Frank Capra, who wrote the screenplay with Jonathan Latimer. Unlike the first three of the films, this film was directed by [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]], who also appears in the film.&lt;ref name=Poague /&gt; The film was televised on February 12, 1958, with a disappointing audience share and many critical press reviews.&lt;ref name="Gilbert, p. 222"&gt;Gilbert, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent commentators have noted that this film exhibits an early concern with [[Global warming|climate change]] caused by human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frank Capra: Most Prescient Film-maker of the 20th Century |last=Reilly |first=Michael |publisher=Discovery Channel |date=March 18, 2010 |url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/frank-capra-most-prescient-film-maker-of-the-20th-century.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unchained goddess: Frank Capra knew |last=Jenkins |first=Amber |work=My Big Fat Planet |publisher=NASA |date=December 2, 2010 |url=https://climate.nasa.gov/blogs/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowBlog&amp;NewsID=447&amp;CFID=7007614&amp;CFTOKEN=70172798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Warner films==

There is a second, similar sculpture of a person's mouth that is standing closer to the viewer; only a portion of it is visible. There is a television camera on wheels between the two sculptures.]]
The television ratings for these specials and the critical response to them were important to AT&amp;T and to N. W. Ayer, which was apparently dissatisfied with ''The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays'' and ''Unchained Goddess''. Capra had also become unhappy with the working relationship with his sponsors.&lt;ref name="Gilbert, p. 222"/&gt; The fifth through the eighth films in the series were produced by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The first screen in the credits for these films is "Produced under the personal supervision of [[Jack L. Warner]]". Owen Crump was the producer for the four films, and directed three of them, but (unlike Capra) he did not write the screenplays. Crump retained Frank Baxter as the host for the four films, but he dispensed with the Dr. Research/Mr. Writer pairing of the Capra films.

Geoff Alexander and [[Rick Prelinger]] have written, "From the perspective of overall cohesion, writing, and set design, Crump's Bell series films are superior to those of Capra. Crump did not overtly proselytize, relied less on animated characters interacting with Dr. Baxter, and utilized the set design as almost a character in itself, as exemplified by William Kuehl's sound stage set for ''Gateways to the Mind'', and his madcap carnival-like set for ''Alphabet Conspiracy''."&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt; See the screenshot for one example of Kuehl's work. Marcel LaFollette has commented that, while the "spiritual tone" of the Capra films wasn't present the Warner films, "overt appeals to religion also appeared in the four created by Warner Brothers".&lt;ref name=LaFollette08 /&gt;

[[Ellis W. Carter]] was the cinematographer for three of the films; Mark Davis was credited for ''Thread of Life''. The first two Warner films were edited by the Warner Bros. veteran Fred MacDowell, who died in 1960. Frank P. Keller returned to edit the third and fourth films.

===''Gateways to the Mind'' (1958)===
''Gateways to the Mind'' is about the [[sense|five senses]] are and how they work.  It was produced and directed by Owen Crump. The screenplay was by Henry F. Greenberg, a television screenwriter who was active in the 1950s and 60s. In addition to Dr. Baxter, it starred [[Wilder Penfield]] and [[Hadley Cantrell]], with actor [[Karl Swenson]] playing the role of a cameraman (the program was set on a soundstage in a mock "behind-the-scenes" format). [[Chuck Jones]] directed the animation, which was designed by [[Maurice Noble]]. In 1966, Jones won an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] for directing ''[[The Dot and the Line: A Romance in Lower Mathematics]]'' (1965).

===''The Alphabet Conspiracy'' (1959)===
''The Alphabet Conspiracy'' examines [[language]] and its history. The screenplay was written by Leo Salkin and Richard Hobson. Salkin had worked for UPA (the firm that produced animations for ''Our Mr. Sun'') both as an animator and as the writer for numerous cartoon shorts. The screenplay uses characters from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''. It was directed by Robert B. Sinclair, who had worked on numerous films and television programs. The cast included [[Cheryl Callaway]] (as Judy), [[Stanley Adams (actor)|Stanley Adams]] (as the theatrical agent), and [[Hans Conried]] (as the [[Mad Hatter]]). [[Daws Butler]] (uncredited) voiced several characters. The animated sequences were directed by [[Friz Freleng]], who subsequently won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] for directing ''[[The Pink Phink]]'' (1964).

===''Thread of Life'' (1960)===
AT&amp;T and N. W. Ayer were apparently somewhat dissatisfied with the first two Warner films, and unsuccessfully approached Capra about bidding on production of ''Thread of Life'' and ''About Time''.&lt;ref name="Gilbert, p. 222"/&gt; ''Thread of Life'' is about [[heredity]], [[DNA]] and how it works. The screenplay was by Rowland Barber, a writer perhaps best known for the 1960 novel ''[[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]''. Owen Crump directed; [[Robert McKimson]] directed the animation.

===''About Time'' (1962)===
''About Time'' examines [[time]]. The screenplay was written by Richard Hobson, Nancy Pitt, and Leo Salkin. Owen Crump directed, with [[Phil Monroe]] directing the animations. The film starred [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]] and [[Les Tremayne]] and featured [[Richard Feynman]] who was used as a consultant.

==The Disney film: ''The Restless Sea'' (1964)==
''The Restless Sea'' examines the [[oceans]]. The half-hour film was the last of the Bell Telephone Science Series, and was produced by Walt Disney Productions. The director was [[Les Clark]]; the film starred [[Walt Disney]], as himself, and [[Sterling Holloway]], who replaced Baxter.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;

Then, with Amy's character Rachel out of the picture, it was decided Tony should go with her, so Jon Sivewright is leaving too."&lt;ref name="quit"/&gt; Fellow cast member [[Rebecca Breeds]] who plays [[Ruby Buckton]] in the serial spoke out about their departures stating: "In terms of character, to see Tony and Rachel go is kind of upsetting because they fill a really important demographic - that middle-aged, new family thing and there's nothing like that on the show now so they're a loss."&lt;ref name="breed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home and Away's Breeds "upset" by star exits|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/home-and-away/news/home-and-aways-breeds-upset-by-star-exits/9368|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=2011-01-08|date=13 June 2010&lt;!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vZObUxX5?url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/home-and-away/news/home-and-aways-breeds-upset-by-star-exits/9368|archivedate=07 January 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toyoma Education Museum''' exhibits the history of [[education in Japan]] since the [[Meiji period]]. It is housed in the {{nihongo|former Tome Elementary School Building|旧登米高等尋常小学校校舎}} of 1888 in the city of [[Tome, Miyagi|Tome]], [[Miyagi Prefecture]]. The U-shaped two-storey building around a courtyard, lined with balconies and with half-hexagons at the end of each wing, was designed by Kisaburo Yamazoe. It is representative of the western-inspired architecture of the [[Meiji period]] and in 1981 was designated an [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=102&amp;item_id=140 |title=Database of Registered National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pref.miyagi.jp/bunkazai/siteibunkazai/miyagi-no-bunkazai/01kenzoubutu/kuni/16toyoma.htm |title=高蔵寺阿弥陀堂 |publisher=[[Miyagi Prefecture]] |accessdate=25 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909094104/http://www.pref.miyagi.jp/bunkazai/siteibunkazai/miyagi-no-bunkazai/01kenzoubutu/kuni/16toyoma.htm |archivedate=9 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jnto.go.jp/tourism/en/s015.html |title=Toyoma |publisher=[[Japan National Tourism Organization]] |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.tome.miyagi.jp/en/touristl_his.html |title=Historical Sightseeing Locations |publisher=[[Tome, Miyagi|Tome City]] |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toyoma.on.arena.ne.jp/english.pdf |title=The Museum of Toyoma |publisher=Toyoma Town |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Department of Education''' ('''ED''' or '''DoED'''), also referred to as '''the ED''' for (the) Education Department, is a [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]-level department of the [[federal government of the United States|United States government]]. It began operating on May 4, 1980, having been created after the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was split into the Department of Education and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] by the [[Department of Education Organization Act]], which President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed into law on October 17, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|96|88|93|668|1979|10|17|S|210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/04/15/department-of-education-organization-act-1979/|title=Department of Education Organization Act, 1979|author=|date=15 April 2011|website=wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Education is administered by the [[United States Secretary of Education]]. It has under 4,000 employees (2018)&lt;ref name="politico"/&gt; and an annual budget of $68 billion (2016).&lt;ref name="About ED" /&gt; The 2019 Budget also supports $129.8 billion in new postsecondary grants, loans, and work-study assistance to help an estimated 11.5 million students and their families pay for college.&lt;ref name="FY2019 Federal Budget"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget19/budget-factsheet.pdf|title=ED FY2019 Budget|author=U.S. Secretary of Education|date=14 February 2018|website=ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its official abbreviation is "ED" ("DOE" refers to the [[United States Department of Energy]]) and is also often abbreviated informally as "DoEd".

==Functions==

The primary functions of the Department of Education are to "establish policy for, administer and coordinate most federal assistance to education, collect data on US schools, and to enforce federal educational laws regarding privacy and civil rights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/about/what-we-do.html What We Do]. ED.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Education does not establish schools or colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/focus/what_pg2.html|title=An Overview of the U.S. Department of Education, p. 2|publisher=United States Department of Education|accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the systems of most other countries, [[education in the United States]] is highly decentralized, and the federal government and Department of Education are not heavily involved in determining curricula or educational standards (with the recent exception of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]). This has been left to state and local school districts. The quality of educational institutions and their degrees is maintained through an informal private process known as [[educational accreditation|accreditation]], over which the Department of Education has no direct public jurisdictional control.

The Department of Education is a member of the [[United States Interagency Council on Homelessness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usich.gov/member_agency/department_of_education/|title=Department of Education &amp;#124; Member Agency &amp;#124; United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH)|publisher=Usich.gov|accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and works with federal partners to ensure proper education for homeless and runaway youth in the United States.

Opposition to the Department of Education mainly stems from [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], who see the department as an undermining of [[states rights]], and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]] who believe it results in a state-imposed leveling towards the bottom and low value for taxpayers' money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/daily/6095/LaissezFaire-Learning|title=Laissez-faire-learning|accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Budget==

The U.S. Department of Education provides a service to the education system that acts as like a government for schooling around the country. This is the place where the rules are made that exist in our school system today. “Since the Department of Education (Education) began operations in fiscal year 1980, its mission has included promoting student achievement and ensuring equal access to educational opportunity. To do so, Education partners with state and local governments, which provide most of the resources to school districts for K-12 programs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=Janie|last2=Swain|first2=Holly Hilboldt|date=2017-07|title=Using the U.S. Civil Rights Movement to explore social justice education with K-6 pre-service teachers|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0885985X16300869|journal=The Journal of Social Studies Research|volume=41|issue=3|pages=217–233|doi=10.1016/j.jssr.2016.09.002|issn=0885-985X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity is one of the most forefront issues that is discussed about within the U.S. Department of Education’s four walls. The goal of this agency is to make sure that every student in primary and secondary education has the tools that they need to succeed. Not all of their ideas always work out in the best favor of the students. Throughout recent history, the educational system has not always been focused on furthering the development of all students (in regards to race and gender). However, coming out of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century this ideal has been turned around and many new legislations have been put in place to break down these invisible walls that were surrounding the people who were affected by this hindrance. “The U.S., like other countries in the 21st century, is increasingly operating in an interconnected world. New structures require that teachers and our next generations of students prepare and expand ideas about their responsibilities as citizens".

== History ==
===Establishment===
A previous Department of Education was created in 1867 but was soon demoted to an Office in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/1867-act-to-establish-a-federal-department-of-education/|title=Act to Establish a Federal Department of Education, 1867|author=|date=19 February 2011|website=wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=014/llsl014.db&amp;recNum=465 Chap. CLVIII. 14 Stat. 434] from [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/ "A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U. S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875"]. [[Library of Congress]], [[Law Library of Congress]]. Retrieved April 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As an agency not represented in the president's cabinet, it quickly became a relatively minor bureau in the Department of the Interior. In 1939, the bureau was transferred to the [[Federal Security Agency]], where it was renamed the Office of Education. In 1953, the Federal Security Agency was upgraded to cabinet-level status as the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

In 1979, President Carter advocated for creating a cabinet-level Department of Education.&lt;ref name=outlined&gt;{{cite news |title= Department of Education Outlined |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, via Google News |date=February 9, 1979 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IkwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5661,1224804&amp;dq=department+of+education&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's plan was to transfer most of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's education-related functions to the Department of Education.&lt;ref name=outlined/&gt; Carter also planned to transfer the education-related functions of the departments of Defense, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, as well as a few other federal entities.&lt;ref name=outlined/&gt; Among the federal education-related programs that were not proposed to be transferred were Headstart, the Department of Agriculture's school lunch and nutrition programs, the Department of the Interior's Native Americans' education programs, and the Department of Labor's education and training programs.&lt;ref name=outlined/&gt;

Upgrading Education to cabinet level status in 1979 was opposed by many in the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], who saw the department as [[United States Constitution|unconstitutional]], arguing that the Constitution doesn't mention ''education'', and deemed it an unnecessary and illegal federal bureaucratic intrusion into local affairs. However, many see the department as constitutional under the [[Commerce Clause]], and that the funding role of the Department is constitutional under the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]]. The [[National Education Association]] supported the bill, while the [[American Federation of Teachers]] opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=House Narrowly Passes Department of Education Bill |agency=The New York Times |publisher=The Spokesman-Review, via Google News |location=Spokane, Washington |date=July 12, 1979 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lGsjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HO4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7077,5962023&amp;dq=department-of-education&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1979, the Office of Education had 3,000 employees and an annual budget of $12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Federal Education Branch Is Foundering, Leaderless |first=Fred M |last=Hechinger |agency=New York Times News Service |date=September 3, 1979 |publisher=The Dispatch, via Google News |location=Lexington, North Carolina |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_zUgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qVEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6849,7247406&amp;dq=department-of-education+senate&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress appropriated to the Department of Education an annual budget of $14 billion and 17,000 employees when establishing the Department of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Education Department Created |agency=United Press International |publisher=The Palm Beach Post, via Google News |date=October 18, 1979 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0sZUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ejsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1984,3959160&amp;dq=department+of+education&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1980 presidential campaign, Gov. Reagan called for the total elimination of the U.S. Department of Education, severe curtailment of bilingual education, and massive cutbacks in the federal role in education. Once in office, President Reagan [[Domestic policy of the Ronald Reagan administration#Education|significantly reduced its budget]].&lt;ref name=edleg&gt;[[Pi Lambda Theta|Educational Horizons]]: [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ684842.pdf "The Educational Legacy of Ronald Reagan"], Summer 2004 v. 82 n. 4 p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
The Republican Party platform of 1980 called for the elimination of the Department of Education created under Carter and President [[Ronald Reagan]] promised during the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]] to eliminate it as a cabinet post,&lt;ref name="pbsfall96"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/backgrounders/department_of_education.html|title=Online Backgrounders: The Department of Education|date=Fall 1996|publisher=''PBS''|accessdate=2005-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not able to do so with a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="catoed" /&gt; In the 1982 [[State of the Union]] Address, he pledged: "The budget plan I submit to you on Feb. 8 will realize major savings by dismantling the Department of Education."&lt;ref name="catoed" /&gt;

By 1984 the GOP had dropped the call for elimination from its platform, and with the election of President [[George H. W. Bush]] the Republican position evolved in almost lockstep with that of the Democrats, with [[Goals 2000]] a virtual joint effort.

After the [[Newt Gingrich]]-led "revolution" in 1994 had taken control of both Houses of Congress, federal control of and spending on education soared. That trend continued unabated despite the fact that the Republican Party made abolition of the Department a cornerstone of 1996 platform and campaign promises, calling it an inappropriate federal intrusion into local, state, and family affairs.&lt;ref name="catoed" /&gt; The GOP platform read: "The Federal government has no constitutional authority to be involved in school curricula or to control jobs in the market place. This is why we will abolish the Department of Education, end federal meddling in our schools, and promote family choice at all levels of learning."&lt;ref name="catoed" /&gt;

In 2000, the [[Republican Liberty Caucus]] passed a resolution to abolish the Department of Education.&lt;ref name="workingca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workingcalifornians.com/2008_presidential_issues/education|title=Education|year=2007|accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abolition of the organization was not pursued under the [[George W. Bush]] administration, which made reform of federal education a key priority of the President's first term. In 2008 and 2012, presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]] campaigned in part on an opposition to the Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Stossel/story?id=3970818|title=Ron Paul Unplugged|date=2007-12-10|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=2008-01-30|author=Stossel, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later history ===
[[File:Department of Education - NCLB door.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|A construction project to repair and update the building façade at the Department of Education headquarters in 2002 resulted in the installation of structures at all of the entrances to protect employees and visitors from falling debris. ED redesigned these protective structures to promote the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. The structures were temporary and were removed in 2008. Source: U.S. Department of Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2002/04/04112002a.html|title=Paige Fields Team to Leave No Child Behind|date=April 11, 2002|publisher=United States Department of Education|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030924230508/http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2002/04/04112002a.html|archivedate=September 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Under President [[George W. Bush]], the Department primarily focused on elementary and secondary education, expanding its reach through the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. The Department's budget increased by $14 billion between 2002 and 2004, from $46 billion to $60 billion.&lt;ref name="catoed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/elimination-lost-what-happened-abolishing-department-education|title=Elimination Lost: What happened to abolishing the Department of Education?|date=2004-02-11|publisher=''Cato Institute''|quote=This article originally appeared in [[National Review Online]] on February 11, 2004.|author=Veronique de Rugy and Marie Gryphon|accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Michelle D.|last2=Winn|first2=Kathleen M.|last3=Reedy|first3=Marcy A.|date=2017-10-13|title=The Every Student Succeeds Act: Strengthening the Focus on Educational Leadership|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0013161X17735871|journal=Educational Administration Quarterly|language=en|volume=53|issue=5|pages=705–726|doi=10.1177/0013161x17735871|issn=0013-161X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] signed into law {{USBill|110|H.R.|584}}, which designates the ED Headquarters building as the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] Department of Education Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/03/20070323-6.html |title=President Bush Signs H.R. 584, Designates U.S. Department of Education as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=2007-03-23 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the time after George W. Bush’s presidency and towards the end of President Barack Obama’s presidency, there was an extremely noticeable problem within the education system that was excluding many children from receiving the striving opportunities that they should have been given throughout their schooling careers. So, In December of 2015 President Barack Obama had instituted the Every Student Succeeds Act, which reauthorized the Elementary Secondary Education Act. “In December 2015, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was signed into law, reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and replacing the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). ESEA, the federal law that authorizes federal funding for K-12 schools, represents the nation’s commitment to equal educational opportunity for all students and has influenced the education of millions of children."

On February 7, 2017, Representative [[Thomas Massie]] (R-KY) introduced {{USBill|115|H.R.|899}}, a bill to abolish the department. Massie's bill, which is one sentence long, states, "The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2018."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://massie.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rep-massie-introduces-bill-to-abolish-federal-department-of-education|title=Rep.

'''The Wisconsin Center for the Advancement of Postsecondary Education (WISCAPE)''' was established in 2001 on the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] campus by former UW–Madison Chancellor [[David Ward (university president)|David Ward]].&lt;ref name=Heinen&gt;Heinen, N. “A Rare Look Inward.” Madison Magazine, March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Ward envisioned the center as “a policy [[think tank]], not just an academic think tank,” that would promote cross-disciplinary research and scholarship on [[postsecondary education]], enhance professional development for those working at colleges and universities, and engage the public in a dialogue about the role of postsecondary education in a democratic society.&lt;ref name=Heinen /&gt;

==Areas of focus==
Local and national media have since highlighted the work of the center’s staff, scholars, and affiliates on a variety of postsecondary education issues, including [[Student financial aid in the United States|financial aid]],&lt;ref name=Ziff&gt;Ziff, D. “A Study on Grant Students.” Wisconsin State Journal, July 27, 2008.

The '''École Nationale Supérieure des Industries Chimiques''' ('''ENSIC''') is an Engineering School dedicated to [[Chemical Engineering]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[France]].

Ensic Nancy is one of the seven schools of the [[National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine|Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine]] (INPL), France's largest technological university.
==Creation==
In October 1885, it was announced that the authorities were in favour of the creation of an institute of chemistry in Nancy.  This pulled together a variety of chemical activities in the University of Nancy, with the specific aim of instructing young men in the practical application of chemistry to industry and agriculture. The decree authorizing the creation of the Institute was made on 8 September 1887 and construction began in 1888. The first 6 students joined in 1889 and [[Albin Haller]] was appointed as director on 30 July 1890.  on 6 June 1892 it was formally inaugurated by the President of the Republic, [[Marie François Sadi Carnot]].

''La contribution des pharmaciens à la création (1887-1892) et à l'enseignement de l'Institut Chimique de Nancy. L'influence des systèmes étrangers d'éducation sur cette création.'' &lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Achievements==
One of its early professors, [[Victor Grignard]], obtained the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Chemistry]] in 1912 for his invention of the organo-metallic compounds known as "[[Grignard reagent|Grignard's reagents]]". After the Second World War, ENSIC introduced to France chemical engineering principles developed in the English-speaking world.

The school created a [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] in December 2008 to support its activities, called ''Fondation ENSIC'', with the participation of [[Arkema]].
