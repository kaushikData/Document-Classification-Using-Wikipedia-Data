'''14 Wall Street''', originally the '''Bankers Trust Company Building''', is a [[skyscraper]] at 14 [[Wall Street]] at the corner of [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] and running through to Pine Street in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. It sits across Nassau Street from [[Federal Hall National Memorial]], across Wall Street from the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and diagonally across from the original headquarters of [[J. P. Morgan &amp; Company]]. It was built in 1910-12 and was designed by [[Trowbridge &amp; Livingston]] in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]] as the headquarters for [[Bankers Trust]]. An addition with [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco detailing]], designed by [[Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon]], was constructed in 1931-33. The stepped pyramid at the building's top is a noted part of the downtown skyline, and became the logo for Bankers Trust, which sold the building in 1937.&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was designated a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]] on January 14, 1997.&lt;ref name=desrep&gt;Harris, Gale. [http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/14Wall.pdf "Bankers Trust Building Designation Report"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193819/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/14Wall.pdf |date=March 3, 2016 }} [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] (January 14, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The concept behind the building's design was to place the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] on top of [[St Mark's Campanile]] in Venice. Many early skyscrapers took the Venetian bell-tower as a logical model for a modern office tower, but 14 Wall Street was the first to top it off with a temple in the sky, a seven-story stepped pyramid modeled on one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. [[Bankers Trust]], for whom the building was constructed, then adopted the pyramid as its trademark, and took as its slogan "A Tower of Strength".

The first stage of construction, 1910–1912, was marked by the demolition of a 20-story [[Gillender Building]], claimed to be the first skyscraper demolished to make way for a taller skyscraper.&lt;ref name=Apr30&gt;{{ cite news | title=Skyscraper Going: Higher One Coming.

In its day the world's tallest bank building, the skyscraper originally housed the headquarters of [[Bankers Trust]], which was founded in 1903 when a number of commercial banks needed a vehicle to enter the trusts and estates market; fourteen years later it became a full-service bank,&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt; and one of the country's wealthiest financial institutions. The bank occupied only the three lower floors; its main operations were housed elsewhere in less expensive offices.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the remainder of the building was rental property.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

The 31st floor was once an apartment belonging to [[J. P. Morgan]]. The space was converted into an upscale French restaurant called "The 14 Wall Street." However, the restaurant closed in April 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://search.cityguide.aol.com/newyork/restaurants/closed-14-wall-street-restaurant/v-106895771 | title=14 Wall St Restaurant Closed | publisher=AOL Cityguide | accessdate=January 1, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830083922/http://search.cityguide.aol.com/newyork/restaurants/closed-14-wall-street-restaurant/v-106895771 | archive-date=August 30, 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; following plans in 2004 to convert the entire building from offices into luxury condos.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FOS/is_2004_May_12/ai_n6265860 | title=Whitehall team set to market 14 Wall Street | publisher=Real Estate Alert|date=May 12, 2004 | accessdate=January 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 21, 2007, the building's owners, having stalled in their residential conversion plan, agreed to sell the property to [[Cushman &amp; Wakefield]].

In April 2012, majority control of the building was sold for $303 million in cash to [[Alexander Rovt]], a fertilizer tycoon from Ukraine, who paid off the building's outstanding debt as part of the deal. Rovt, who is listed as #372 on the ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, paid less than the $325 million building had sold for in 2007, at the peak of the real estate boom. At the time of the purchase, it had 300,000 square feet of vacant space, and three potential tenants were in discussion to lease about two-thirds of that amount.&lt;ref&gt;Satow, Julie.

'''Anson Green Phelps''' (March 24, 1781 – November 30, 1853) was an American entrepreneur and business man from Connecticut. Beginning with a saddlery business, he founded [[Phelps Dodge|Phelps, Dodge &amp; Co.]] in 1833 as an export-import business with his sons-in-law [[William E. Dodge]] and [[Daniel James (businessman)|Daniel James]] based as partners in [[Liverpool]], England.  His third son-in-law, [[James Boulter Stokes]], became a partner some years later.

Later in the 19th century after the senior Phelps' death, Phelps Dodge acquired mining interests and companies in the American West, and became known primarily as a mining company.

== Early life ==

Anson Green Phelps was born in [[Simsbury, Connecticut]], in 1781; his mother died when he was 12 years old. Afterward, he was raised in the house of the [[Congregational]] minister of Simsbury. Phelps was descended from the early American colonial governors [[Thomas Dudley]], [[John Haynes (governor)|John Haynes]] and [[George Wyllys]].  On October 13, 1799, he chose a relative, Thomas Woodbridge Phelps, as his guardian.

On May 5, 1799, Thomas Woodbridge Phelps and Anson Green Phelps were admitted to the [[Congregational Church]] in [[Canton, Connecticut|South Canton, Connecticut]], which was led by Reverend Jeremiah Hallock. In his early adulthood, Anson Phelps left Simsbury and settled in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=phelps&gt;{{cite book|title=The Phelps Family of America and Their English Ancestors|author=Phelps, Judge Oliver Seymour and Andrew T. Servin| publisher=Eagle Publishing Company|location=Pittsfield, Massachusetts| year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1409–1412}}

== Career ==
After moving to Hartford, Phelps began manufacturing saddles and shipping them to the South. His business grew rapidly. He had a large brick building constructed on North Main street, which became known as the "Phelps Block." In 1812 he moved to [[New York City]] and began doing business with [[Elisha Peck (Merchant)|Elisha Peck]] under the firm name of Phelps, Peck &amp; Co. in the United States. In [[Liverpool]], [[England]], where Peck managed it, the firm was known as Peck, Phelps &amp; Co. They dealt in metal imports from England including tin, tin plate, iron, and brass; and exported cotton from the South to the textile mills in England.&lt;ref name=phelps/&gt; Such cotton trade was highly important to England and contributed to its considering support for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.

Fellow businessman Sheldon Smith persuaded Phelps to invest in the growing town of [[Derby, Connecticut]], in an area that came to be known as Birmingham. Unable to grow his business farther north, Phelps selected a location on the east bank of the [[Naugatuck River]] in what is now downtown [[Ansonia, Connecticut|Ansonia]]. Ansonia was first settled in 1652 and named in honor of Anson Phelps. The state chartered Ansonia as a borough of Derby in 1864, and later as a separate town in 1889. In 1893, Ansonia incorporated as a city, consolidating with the boundaries of the town.

Phelps' business continued to prosper and he accumulated a large fortune. His original partnership with Peck was dissolved in 1832 following the destruction of their New York warehouse (4 May 1832) due to structural failure.  Phelps and his son narrowly escaped, but among the dead was Josiah Stokes, a senior clerk who was betrothed to Phelps daughter, Caroline.

This was a terrible blow to Phelps and his family. He reorganized the business, forming the [[Phelps Dodge]] Company in 1833 with his sons-in-law [[William Earl Dodge]] and [[Daniel James (businessman)|Daniel James]] as partners. The two of them operated the firm's functions in Liverpool, England. In 1839 Phelps made his son Anson G. Phelps, Jr. a partner, with a one-eighth share of the business.

Caroline Phelps eventually married James Boulter Stokes, brother of the dead Josiah. He became the third son-in-law of Phelps to join Phelps, Dodge &amp; Co. as a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleland|first=Robert Glass|title=A History of Phelps Dodge|date=1952|publisher=Alfred A Knopf|location=New York|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stokes was wealthy in his own right. During the 1837 financial crisis, he helped the Phelps, Dodge partnership through a difficult time with a loan.

Phelps' business interests included banking, property, mining, ironworks, shipping, railroads and timber.  After the split with Peck, some of these interests were divided between the two men. Others remained in joint partnership, including the New York property portfolio and shipping. Peck, who took over the rolling mill at Haverstraw, would continue to purchase raw materials from Phelps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleland|first=Robert Glass|title=A History of Phelps Dodge|date=1952|publisher=Alfred A Knopf|location=New York|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropic interests==
Phelps continued to be an active member of the Congregational Church, and he took an interest in a number of philanthropic causes. He contributed generously to the [[American Bible Society]], the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], the [[American Home Missionary Society]], the [[American Colonization Society|Colonization Society]], the Blind Asylum of New York City, and served as the president of each at some point during his life.

He also contributed to many other societies and charitable institutions both while he lived and through his estate. He gave his native town of [[Simsbury, Connecticut]] US$1000 to aid the poor.  Among his other philanthropic activities was the creation of the Anson G. Phelps lecture series on early American history at [[New York University]].

In the 1830s, Phelps supported Presbyterian preacher [[Charles Grandison Finney]] during his ministry in New York. Phelps first hired a church for him in Vanderwater Street, and later purchased a church in Princes Street, near Broadway.  Finney was "much struck with the piety of Mr Phelps", and said that Phelps would rise at night so that he could commune with God, having little time for secret devotion during the day, when business pressed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosell/Dupuis|first=Garth/Richard|title=The Original Memoirs of Charles G Finney|year=1989|publisher=Zondervan|location=Michigan|pages=Chapter XX Revivals in Columbia and New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Phelps married [[Olivia Egleston]], daughter of Elihu and Elizabeth Egleston, on 26 October 1806 at the age of 25. He and Olivia had nine children: Elizabeth, Melissa, Caroline Olivia (died in infancy), and Caroline, all born in Hartford; and Harriett, Anson Green Jr., Olivia Egleston, and Lydia Ann, all born in New York City. His grandsons included [[Anson Phelps Stokes]] and [[William Earl Dodge Stokes]]. His great-grandson, [[Anson Phelps Stokes (philanthropist)|Anson Phelps Stokes]], became a well-known philanthropist.  In 1835 Phelps purchased the house of Henry A. Coster and added land to extend the property from Third Avenue to the [[East River]], and from Twenty-ninth to half-way between Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stokes|first1=Anson Phelps|title=Stokes Records Vol 1|date=1910|publisher=Privately printed|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and bequests ==
Phelps died at his New York residence, formerly the Coster place, on 30 November 1853 at age 73. He left about two million dollar, of which almost seven hundred thousand was his shares in Phelps Dodge &amp; Co.  These were purchased by the other partners. Just over one million dollars was property in New York, Indiana, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Missouri.  His will was contested and there were so many anomalies that his widow, who was the executrix, put it before the courts to sort out.  It was after her death that the final verdict was given by the court of appeal in 1861.  Due to a technical issue with the wording of the will, one large bequest of $50,000 to the Liberia College was declared void by the courts.  However, the family held this bequest to be sacred and the donation stood despite the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowitt|first1=Richard|title=A Merchant Prince of the 19th Century|date=1954|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was eulogized by a Mrs. Sigourney in writing:
{{cquote|The cares of commerce and the rush of wealth Swept not away his meekness, nor the time To cultivate all household charities; Nor the answering, conscientious zeal To consecrate a portion of his gains To man's relief and the Redeemer's cause.}}{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In his will, Phelps left instructions to his heirs in terms that characterized his life:
{{cquote|I give and bequeath to each of my grand-children, living at my decease, the sum of $5,000, to be paid them as they severally attain the age of 21 years. This latter bequest I direct to be accompanied by my executors with this injunction:-That each of my said grand-children shall consider the said bequest as a sacred deposit, committed to their trust, to be invested by each grand-child, and the income derived therefrom to be devoted to spread  the gospel, and to promote the Redeemer's kingdom oil earth, hoping and trusting that the God of Heaven will give to each of that wisdom which is from above,  and incline them to be faithful stewards, and transmit the same to their descendants, to be sacredly devoted to the same object.

It has recently been moved from its long-time location in [[Campus Martius Park]] to a new location in just down the street in [[Campus Martius Park#Cadillac Square Park|Cadillac Square Park]]. The fountain was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1971.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; The [[John N.

[[File:WoodwardAve1891.jpg|left|thumb|Woodward Avenue c. 1891 showing Bagley Fountain (far left)]]
[[John J. Bagley]] was the 16th governor of Michigan, serving from 1873 to 1877.&lt;ref name="city"&gt;[http://www.ci.detroit.mi.us/historic/districts/bagley_fountain.pdf Bagley Memorial Fountain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011105807/http://www.ci.detroit.mi.us/historic/districts/bagley_fountain.pdf |date=2007-10-11 }} from the city of Detroit&lt;/ref&gt; Bagley also served as a Detroit Alderman from 1860–61 and as Police Commissioner from 1865-72. He was instrumental in the creation of the Detroit Metropolitan Police Commission and the construction of the first [[Detroit House of Corrections]].&lt;ref name="city"/&gt; When Bagley died in 1881, his will contained $5,000 for the construction of a drinking fountain for the people of Detroit, having "water cold and pure as the coldest mountain stream."&lt;ref name="city"/&gt;

==Fountain==
In 1885, the Bagley family chose [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] to design the fountain.&lt;ref name="hhr"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gBDXfLHsnc4C Jeffrey Karl Ochsner,] ''H.H. Richardson, Complete Architectural Works,'' MIT Press, 1982, {{ISBN|0-262-65015-0}}, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, the Bagley Memorial Fountain was dedicated at the corner of [[Woodward Avenue]] and Fort Street. Richardson constructed the fountain entirely out of pink [[Bragville granite]], modeled after a [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] located in [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="city"/&gt; The Bagley Memorial Fountain stands 21 feet high with a basin 7 feet across. At the center of the fountain, four lion heads distribute water. In the original design, two of the heads produced "normal" temperature water and the other two produced cold water, chilled by ice packed around the fountain pipes.&lt;ref name="city"/&gt; The inscription on the four sides of the cornice reads: TESTAMENTARY GIFT | FOR THE PEOPLE FROM | JOHN JVDSON BAGLEY | A.D. MDCCCLXXXVII.

==Later moves==
In 1926 the fountain was moved from its original home at Woodward and Fort to Campus Martius, because of the increase of automobile traffic.&lt;ref name="city"/&gt; In 2000, the fountain was removed from it site, disassembled, and put into storage.&lt;ref name="wat"&gt;[http://www.dwsd.org/announce/flow/InTheFlow_winter_2007.pdf "Bagley Fountain Makes a Comeback,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513142349/http://www.dwsd.org/announce/flow/InTheFlow_winter_2007.pdf |date=2008-05-13 }} ''In the Flow,'' Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, V7 n1 (Winter 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the fountain was installed in its current location in Cadillac Square; a new lion fountainhead replaced the original, which was stolen.&lt;ref name="wat"/&gt; It is the only remaining work by Richardson in the Detroit area.&lt;ref name="city"/&gt;

'''Celgene Corporation''' is an American biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes medicines for cancer and inflammatory disorders.  It is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in [[Summit, New Jersey]]. The company's major product is Revlimid ([[lenalidomide]]), in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of [[multiple myeloma]] patients. Revlimid is also approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk [[Myelodysplastic syndrome| Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)]] associated with a [[Chromosome 5q deletion syndrome|deletion 5q]] [[cytogenetic abnormality]] with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Revlimid is sold through proprietary risk-management distribution programs to ensure safe and appropriate use of these pharmaceuticals. Vidaza is approved for the treatment of patients with MDS.

Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a subsidiary, is a public [[cord blood bank]].

== History ==
In 1986, Celgene, originally a unit of the [[Celanese|Celanese Corporation]], was spun off as an independent company following the merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation.

In August 2000, Celgene acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held company that searches for and develops pharmaceuticals that regulate disease-related genes.  Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now operates as Celgene Research San Diego, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.

In December 2002, Celgene acquired Anthrogenesis, a privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, which is developing technology for the recovery of stem cells from placental tissues following the completion of full-term successful pregnancies.  Anthrogenesis now operates as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene.

In 2006 Celgene certified McKesson Specialty, a [[specialty pharmacy]], as one of a select group of RevAssist(SM) Program contract pharmacies to launch [[lenalidomide]] (trade name Revlimid). As a [[specialty drugs|specialty drug]], lenalidomide requires special handling and is therefore only available through the RevAssist program, a unique distribution network employing only certified, contracted specialty pharmacies.&lt;ref name="prnewswire_2006"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/celgene-selects-mckesson-specialty-as-a-revassist-program-pharmacy-vendor-to-launch-revlimid-55294122.html |title=Celgene Selects McKesson Specialty as a RevAssist Program Pharmacy Vendor to Launch REVLIMID: McKesson Specialty to Provide Dispensing, Reimbursement and Clinical Services |date=13 February 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2015 |work=PRNewswire |location=Harahan, La.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, Celgene closed its $2.9 billion acquisition of Pharmion Corporation.

In December 2009, Celgene announced the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.celgene.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=111960&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1362847 Celgene to Acquire Gloucester Pharmaceuticals] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713233841/http://ir.celgene.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=111960&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1362847 |date=2012-07-13 }}, Dec. 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Celgene looked to relocate its UK headquarters from Riverside House in Windsor to a new development Stockley Park, Uxbridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ukconstructionmagazine.co.uk/online/uk_construction/uk_features/august2011/New%20Head%20Quarters%20for%20Celgene.html | work=UK Construction magazine | title={{sic|hide=y|New Head Q|uarters|expected=Headquarters}} for Celgene - Stockley Park greets new tenant | date=13 October 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030172347/http://www.ukconstructionmagazine.co.uk/online/uk_construction/uk_features/august2011/New%20Head%20Quarters%20for%20Celgene.html | archivedate=30 October 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010 Celgene Corporation and Abraxis BioScience Inc. jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Abraxis BioScience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.celgene.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=111960&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1442901 Celgene to Acquire Abraxis BioScience Inc.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716010035/http://ir.celgene.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=111960&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1442901 |date=2012-07-16 }}, Jun. 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Celgene and Avila Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases through protein silencing, announced a definitive merger agreement under which Celgene Corporation will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. for $350 million in cash, plus up to $195 million for milestones contingent upon the development and regulatory approval of AVL-292, as well as up to $380 million in potential milestone payments contingent upon the development and approval of candidates generated from the Avilomics platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.avilatx.com/news/2012_0126_AvilaCelgene.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing a market capitalization of US$67 billion, and stock appreciation of 107%, Celgene was Forbes Magazine's number 2 ranked drug company of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/12/31/grading-pharma-in-2013-16-drug-companies-ranked/ |title= Grading Pharma in 2013|publisher=Forbes |date=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Celgene and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals entered into a cancer [[Stem cell therapy|stem cell therapeutic]] development agreement encompassing [[demcizumab]] and five other biologics from OncoMed's pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=OncoMed, Celgene in $3.3B+ Cancer Stem Cell Collaboration | author=Staff | date=January 1, 2014 | page=8 | work=[[Gen.

The licensing opportunity gives Celgene the option to acquire Lycera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/celgene-licenses-lycera-s-immune-modulators-in-up-to-105m-deal/81251366/|title=Celgene Licenses Lycera's Immune Modulators in Up-to-$105M+ Deal|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire [[Receptos]] for $7.2 billion in a move to strengthen the company's inflammation and immunology areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/celgene-to-acquire-receptos-for-7-2b/81251504/|title=Celgene to Acquire Receptos for $7.2B|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the deal sent Celgene shares up 5.7% in after hours trading.

&lt;!-- no ind'n here a/o 2016 November of logic of organizing drugs in order Vid, Rev, Thal, Alker, Foc, and indic'ns  chronologically within drug.

As article is on company, not drugs per se, IMO most logical for users is by drug's date of first approval, and chrono w/in drug. Would be nice to provide users w/ switch to reverse order, and switch to choose among (1) that and  (2) drugs in chrono or reverse chrono  order, and chrono within drug. But that would take more wiki-skill

=== Product-related history ===
In July 1998, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Thalomid for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL.

In April 2000, Celgene reached an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to license d-MPH, Celgene's chirally pure version of RITALIN. The FDA subsequently granted approval to market d-MPH, or Focalin, in November 2001.

In December 2005, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Revlimid for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q [[cytogenetic abnormality]] with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.Focalin XR was later launched by Celgene and Novartis in 2005.

In May 2006, Celgene received approval for Thalomid in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

In June 2007, Celgene received full marketing authorization for Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy by the European Commission.

== Litigation ==

===Anti-trust allegations===
In 2009, [[Dr. Reddy]]’s Laboratories requested, and Celgene refused to provide, a samples of Celgene's anticancer drug THALOMID® ([[thalidomide]]).  Dr. Reddy's Laboratories sought the material for bioequivalency studies required to bring its own, generic, version of thalidomide to market. In response to the refusal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA asking the Agency to adopt procedures that would ensure generic applicants the right to buy sufficient samples to perform bioequivalence testing of drugs that were subject to REMS distribution restrictions.

Celgene denied that it had behaved anticompetitively, arguing that the legislative history strongly suggested that Congress considered and rejected a proposed guaranteed access procedure like the one proposed by Dr. Reddy’s. Celgene further argued that requiring innovator companies to sell their products to potential generic competitors would violate its intellectual property rights and subject it to liability risks in the event that patients were harmed in Dr. Reddy's studies.

Generic manufacturer Lannett Company initiated antitrust litigation that accused Celgene of using its REMS for THALOMID® ([[thalidomide]]) to violate the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. In early 2011, the district court denied Celgene’s motion to dismiss. The case was set for trial beginning in February 2012, but the parties settled before the trial began, thereby postponing further judicial review of antitrust claims premised on alleged abuse of REMS distribution restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Fraud allegations===
In July 2017, Celgene agreed to pay $280 million to government agencies to settle allegations that it caused the submission of false claims or fraudulent claims for non-reimbursable uses of its drugs Revlimid and Thalomid to Medicare and state Medicaid programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Celgene Agrees to Pay $280 Million to Resolve Fraud Allegations Related to Promotion of Cancer Drugs For Uses Not Approved by FDA |publisher=Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney’s Office, Central District of California |date=July 24, 2017 |author=Thom Mrozek |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/celgene-agrees-pay-280-million-resolve-fraud-allegations-related-promotion-cancer-drugs |accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its July 2017 10-Q, Celgene disclosed that it resolved the matter in full for $315 million, including fees and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/816284/000081628417000009/a2017063010q.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The case was brought under the [[False Claims Act]] by Beverly Brown, a former Celgene sales representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Celgene to Pay $280 Million to Settle Fraud Suit Over Cancer Drugs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/health/celgene-to-pay-280-million-to-settle-fraud-suit-over-cancer-drugs.html|work=The New York Times|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles DeLano Hine''' (March 15, 1867 – Feb. 13, 1927) was an American civil engineer, lawyer, railway official, and Colonel in the United States Army. He receives academic credit for studying organizations as a separate field, rather than a "smaller sister of sociology.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Yehouda Shenhav]]. "[http://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/yshenhav/files/2013/07/From-Chaos-to-Systems.pdf From Chaos to Systems: The Engineering Foundations of Organization Theory, 1879-1932]," in: ''Administrative Science Quarterly,'' Vol. 40, No. 4 (Dec., 1995), pp. 564-565&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;C.D.L. Hine in ''[[Engineering Magazine]].'' Vol. 42 (1912), p. 481&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bent of Tau Beta Pi.'' Vol. 8 (1913), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haridimos Tsoukas, Christian Knudsen (2005). ''The Oxford Handbook of Organization Theory.'' p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early and family life==
Born in [[Vienna, Virginia]] to former Union veteran Capt. [[Orrin E. Hine]] and his wife Alma, Hine graduated from [[United States Military Academy]], West Point in 1891, and served as a lieutenant in the 6th United States Infantry. He later graduated from [[Cincinnati Law School]].&lt;ref name="Hine 1909 F"&gt;Hine (1909, Foreword)&lt;/ref&gt; He married Helen Underwood on March 27, 1915.

==Career==
Leaving the Army to enter railway service, Hine worked as freight brakeman, switchman, yardmaster, emergency conductor, chief clerk to superintendent, and [[Trainmaster (occupation)|trainmaster]]. When the [[Spanish–American War]] began in 1898 he quit railway service and participated in the Santiago campaign as a major of volunteers. After the war he re-entered railway work, rising to trainmaster and later general superintendent. Subsequently, he did special railway work in various staff positions for both large and small railways in the United States, Canada and Mexico.&lt;ref name="Hine 1909 F"/&gt;

Hine inspected safety appliances for the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]. In 1907 Hine assisted in the revising the business methods of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] at Washington, D.C. Then he was appointed bankruptcy receiver of the [[Northern Virginia trolleys|Washington, Arlington &amp; Falls Church Electric Railway]].

In 1910, Hine became temporary special representative of [[President Taft]], planning ways to improve the organization and methods of the executive departments of the United States government. Meantime, in July, 1908, he had become special representative of Mr. [[Julius Kruttschnitt]], director of maintenance and operation of the Harriman Lines, and had entered on a study of the needs of the operating organization of those railways and of the means that should be adopted to meet those needs. This report led most of the Harriman Lines to adopt the unit system of organization.

On January 15, 1912, Major Hine became vice-president and general manager of the [[Southern Pacific Lines]] in Mexico and the Arizona Eastern, responsible for about 1,600 miles of railway.&lt;ref name="Hine 1909 F"/&gt;

During [[World War I]], on August 5, 1917, Hine (then living in New York City) was drafted to serve as Colonel of Infantry for New York's National Guard. Hisunit was sent overseas, and participated at [[St. Mihiel]] before the war ended and he was honorably discharged on January 10, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;New York, Abstracts of World War I Military Service p. 273, for Charles DeLano Hine&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Hine died in Manhattan in 1927. After a funeral at [[Saint Thomas Church (Manhattan)|St. Thomas Episcopal Church]] in which pall bearers included the President of the [[Lackawanna Railroad]], [[Orlando Harriman Jr.]] and various distinguished military officers,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/cdhine.htm&lt;/ref&gt; he was interred at Arlington National Cemetery, and his widow awarded a pension based on his military service.

==Publications==

=== ''Modern Organization: An Exposition of the Unit System,'' 1912 ===
In the 1912 article "The unit system on the Harriman Lines" in the ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'' Hine wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Organization has been termed a smaller sister of sociology, the science of human nature. Industrial organization, including that of transportation and commerce, reflects and typifies in a greater or less degree the sociological development of a people."&lt;ref&gt;Engineering Magazine, Vol. 42. Jan. 1912: 481-487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His series of articles were republished in the 1912 book, entitled "Modern Organization: An Exposition of the Unit System." In this work Hine also stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The greatest present need is an antidote for the unwillingness of men to profit by the previous experience of others. It would be amusing, were it not so expensive, to watch the gropings of many corporation officers for methods to test efficiency. Ignorant of fundamental principles, intolerant of outside suggestions, unable to detect the analogy in other undertakings, they repeat the expensive experiments of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Charles DeLano Hine. (1912) cited in: Robert Scudder Denham. ''The A-B-C of Cost Engineering.'' Denham Cost-Finding Company, 1919. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 1913 review in the ''[[Journal of Accountancy]]'' stated that Hines was "a firm believer in the personal equation in industry, commerce and all departments of business. Basing his argument to a great extent upon the successful operation of the unit system as applied on the so-called "Harriman lines" he goes step by step through the ideal method of management and operation to what he considers the practical solution of the difficulties which he encounters."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Accountancy,'' Vol. 15 (1913). p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2897">The '''Council of Smaller Enterprises''', known as '''COSE''', is a division of the [[Greater Cleveland Partnership]] and an organization that coordinates the activities of and provides resources and advocacy for [[small business]]es in the [[Greater Cleveland]] area. It is the largest regional small business group in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1980/01/15/archives/smallbusiness-forces-unite-meeting-drafts-proposals-for-carter.html Steve Lohr, "Small-Business Forces Unite; Meeting Drafts Proposals For Carter Memories of Earlier Gatherings Small-Business Forces Unite", ''The New York Times'', Special, Jan. 15, 1980, Business &amp; Finance, Page D1.]&lt;/ref&gt; The COSE Technology Network, [http://www.cose.org/neosa%20network.aspx NEOSA], is an organization within COSE that works to support the technology industry of Northeast Ohio.

==Advocacy==
In 1991, John Polk, the head of the organization at the time, spoke out against mandates for employers to provide health insurance, arguing that such mandates hurt small employers since those businesses were least able to afford health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-11408048.html Colleen Mulcahy, "Benefits administrator blasts health mandates. (John Polk)", ''National Underwriter Property &amp; Casualty-Risk &amp; Benefits Management'', Oct. 14, 1991.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the organization was advocating for health care reform at the national level, particularly focusing on reform oriented towards reducing health care costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-135004463.html Shannon Mortland, "COSE to help push ideas for reforming health care.(Health Care)(Council of Smaller Enterprises)(Brief Article)", ''Crain's Cleveland Business'', Aug. 8, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy==
COSE offers energy solutions that allow its members to save on energy, as well as install more energy efficient systems. It partnered with Metrus Energy and CalCEF to create the Ohio Efficiency Resource Program, a financial tool that allows COSE members to install energy efficient programs with no upfront cost or risk.

==Small Business Convention==
The COSE Small Business Convention, The largest event that COSE hosts, is on an annual basis. Last year,{{when|date=October 2013}} the convention was hosted in [[Sandusky, Ohio]] at the Kalahari Convention Center. The COSE Small Business Convention is the largest in the Midwest.

Companies that do business in more than one currency are exposed to exchange rate risk – that is, changes in the value of one currency versus another. Exchange rate risk (also known as [[foreign exchange risk]], FX risk, or currency risk) is especially high in periods of high currency volatility.

Currency analytics are technology tools that enable global companies to manage the risk associated with currency volatility.&lt;ref&gt;Euromoney, “FX data analytics: banks’ new frontier,” 2 Jul 2015.http://www.euromoney.com/Article/3467575/FX-data-analytics-banks-new-frontier.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Currency analytics often involve automation that helps companies access and validate currency exposure data and make decisions that mitigate currency risk.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, “Using Software to Manage Currency Risk,” 27 Feb 2012. https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203806504577178570179678332&lt;/ref&gt;

== How global companies use currency analytics to manage risk ==

Currency volatility can impact a company’s balance sheet and/or cash flow. Corporate currency analytics help companies manage currency risk in both areas.

== Balance sheet risk ==

In the process of remeasuring transaction currency monetary assets and liability account balances, the difference between the exchange rate when the transaction was posted and exchange rate when the transaction was cleared goes to the functional entity’s income statement as an FX gain or loss. Then in the process of translating the functional entity’s income statement for the reporting entity’s consolidated income statement, that FX gain/loss gets translated at current income statement rate to reporting currency and appears on the consolidated income statement.

Managing balance sheet risk can involve organic (natural) hedging such as using cash positions or intercompany loans to create exposure offsets. It can also involve external hedging such as buying a forward contract to offset FX exposure.

In both cases, efficient hedging depends on being able to drill down into the balance sheet to see the currencies of the transactions sitting on the company’s books around the world. Currency analytics automates that drill-down process and presents balance sheet exposure data in an easy-to-use dashboard that allows companies to efficiently manage balance sheet risk and minimize FX gain/loss.&lt;ref&gt;JPMorgan Chase, “Foreign exchange risk management.” https://www.chase.com/content/dam/chasecom/en/commercial-bank/documents/foreign-exchange-risk-management.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cash flow risk ==

In the process of translating the functional entity’s income statement, revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and operating expenses (OpEx) get translated at the current income statement rate to reporting currency and appear on the consolidated income statement. Currency impact to revenue, COGS, and OpEx arises from differences between the current income statement rate and the forecasted rate.

Managing cash flow risk is fundamentally about protecting the economic value of the company’s future flow of cash from being eroded by currency volatility. It can involve organic (natural) hedging such as pricing contracts in a particular currency. It can also involve external hedging, but accounting rules require matching hedges to forecasted cash flows and don’t allow hedging economic risk.&lt;ref&gt;Treasury &amp; Risk, “Cash Flow Hedging Best Practices,” 28 Jan 2014. [http://www.treasuryandrisk.com/2014/01/28/cash-flow-hedging-best-practices?t=treasury-management http://www.treasuryandrisk.com/2014/01/28/cash-flow-hedging-best-practices?t=treasury-managem]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currency analytics allow companies to mitigate cash flow risk by uncovering accounting exposures to match the economic exposures so the company can hedge the accounting exposure as a proxy. Currency analytics enable what/if scenario analysis so companies can model how volatility in particular currencies could impact their revenue and expenses in the future.

'''Downtown Oakland''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]], [[United States]]; roughly bounded by both the [[Oakland Estuary]] and [[Interstate 880]] on the southwest, [[Interstate 980]] on the northwest, Grand Avenue on the northeast, and [[Lake Merritt]] on the east.

The Downtown area is sometimes expanded to refer to the industrial and residential [[Jack London Square]] and [[Jack London District, Oakland, California|Jack London warehouse district]] areas, the [[Lakeside Apartments District, Oakland, California|Lakeside Apartments District]], which are a largely residential neighborhood on the west side of [[Lake Merritt]], the [[Civic Center, Oakland, California|Civic Center district]], [[Chinatown, Oakland|Chinatown]], and the south end of Oakland's [[Broadway Auto Row, Oakland, California|Broadway Auto Row]], an area along Broadway which has historically been used by car dealers and other automotive service businesses.  While many consider these areas outside of downtown proper, they are generally considered more geographically proximate to Downtown Oakland than to [[East Oakland, Oakland, California|East Oakland]], [[North Oakland, Oakland, California|North Oakland]] or to [[West Oakland, Oakland, California|West Oakland]] and are thus sometimes associated with Downtown Oakland.

==Culture==

===Black Cowboy Parade===
Downtown Oakland hosts the only celebration of its kind in the nation in memory of the black cowboys who helped settle the American West.  The annual parade typically begins on an early October weekend at DeFremery Park in West Oakland en route to [[Frank H. Ogawa Plaza]] where judging booths are set up. After an awards ceremony, the parade returns to DeFremery Park, for a celebration.

==Land use and points of interest==
Downtown Oakland is home to apartment and condominium dwellers, numerous retail businesses, tall modern office buildings, shorter [[mixed-use]] historic buildings, the hubs of [[AC Transit]] and [[BART]], which has three underground stations, the city's official Entertainment District which includes the historic [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)|Paramount]] and [[Fox Oakland Theatre|Fox Theatre]]s, nightclubs, and restaurants, the headquarters of [[Clorox]], [[Oakland City Center|City Center]], a portion of [[Old Oakland]], and a portion of [[Chinatown, Oakland, California|Chinatown]].

Downtown includes a portion of the oldest part of the city. The area from the [[Oakland Estuary]] inland to 14th Street between West Street and the Lake Merritt Channel was the original site of Oakland, and there are several 19th century houses scattered around the edges of downtown and in Chinatown.&lt;ref name="bagwell"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bagwell | first=Beth | title=Oakland, The Story of a City | publisher=| year=1982| location=| isbn=0-9640087-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oakland Museum]] is located on Oak Street near the southeastern edge of Downtown.

==Education==

===Higher education===
[[Laney College]], with more than 12,000 students, is located on Fallon Street near the Lake Merritt BART station. Other educational institutions include [[Lincoln University (California)|Lincoln University]], a small business school catering mainly to international students, and a downtown office of [[Cal State East Bay]]. [[Oaksterdam University]], a business college which prepares students for [[medical cannabis]] work, is located on 15th Street in an area referred to as "[[Oaksterdam]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2rsOpzrrR4 | title=News Segment | publisher=KTVU Television, Oakland, California | date=January 2007 | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jYHN4gdAHV9I6D8_eoKW7hbrxMFgD8V1H8L00 |title=Higher education: Oakland class teaches pot growing Weekend trade school course teaching students to grow, cook pot booked through May |publisher=The Associated Press; Oakland Tribune |author=Lisa Leff |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302042708/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jYHN4gdAHV9I6D8_eoKW7hbrxMFgD8V1H8L00 |archivedate=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[College of California|original campus]] of [[UC Berkeley]] was located between Franklin, Harrison, 12th and 14th streets;&lt;ref name="bagwell"/&gt; and the [[University of California]] system is currently headquartered in Downtown.

===Public primary and secondary education===
Lincoln Elementary School, one of the few public elementary schools in the downtown of a major US city{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}, is on the edge of downtown, near the center of Chinatown. The [[Oakland School for the Arts]], a [[charter school]], is building a new facility surrounding the [[Fox Oakland Theatre]] in Oakland's [[Uptown Oakland]].

==Transportation==

===Motor vehicle limitations===
City Hall Plaza is a city park and a "pedestrian plaza" which includes what was once the terminus of San Pablo Avenue where it met Broadway at 14th Street.  It also includes 15th Street, which once ran through what is now "Kahn's Alley," past 250 [[Frank H. Ogawa Plaza]] building, across Clay Street, through what is now a glass windowed lobby of the California State office building, connecting with Jefferson Street on the building's west side entrance.  Motor vehicle traffic has also been excluded from where former city streets, Washington street and 13th street, were once aligned through what is now the [[Oakland City Center]] development. Today the area features an outdoor retail mall with pedestrian streets laid out to replicate the original street grid.

===AC Transit===
{{main|List of AC Transit routes}}
Several routes operated by AC Transit pass by or end at Downtown Oakland. These include:

'''Local Routes'''

Transit passengers traveling in and out of Downtown are serviced by [[AC Transit]]'s downtown bus station at 14th and Broadway, and [[Uptown Oakland|Uptown]] Regional Transit Center [[bus station|bus mall]] on nearby Thomas L. Berkeley Way (20th Street) is now in full farebox service, and features multiple bus shelters with seating, [[NextBus]] arrival prediction signs, local and [[Rapid|Rapid Bus]] service to Oakland's [[Streetcar Suburbs|streetcar suburbs]]. These stations host local service, [[Bus rapid transit|Rapid]] service, Transbay Express, and [[All-Nighter Network|All Nighter]] service. A [[Clipper (San Francisco Bay Area transit card)|Translink]] Add Value Machine is located at AC Transit Headquarters on Franklin Street.

The "1" line which connects to [[East Oakland, Oakland, California|East Oakland]] and [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] via [[International Boulevard (Oakland, California)|International Blvd.]] and [[California State Route 185]] and terminates at the [[San Leandro station|San Leandro BART station]], runs through downtown along 12th Street. The transformation of the "1" line into a full scale [[bus rapid transit]] corridor is years into the planning process. The most substantial planning alternative proposed for this system would feature articulated buses with five to six doors at boarding platform level, a separated bus-only lane, center median platforms in many areas with [[proof-of-payment]] ticket machines to speed boarding, and signalization priority to allow bus drivers to change traffic lights in passengers favor.

===BART===
Three underground BART stations are located in Downtown: [[12th Street Oakland City Center (BART station)|12th Street/Oakland City Center]] and [[19th Street Oakland (BART station)|19th Street]] are both on Broadway, and [[Lake Merritt (BART station)|Lake Merritt]] is in the eastern area of [[Chinatown, Oakland|Chinatown]] on Madison Street.

== Community Benefit Districts ==
[[File:Downtown-oakland-city-center-94612.jpg|thumb|Oakland City Center as seen in 2018.]]
The Downtown Oakland &lt;ref&gt;http://www.downtownoakland.org&lt;/ref&gt; and Lake Merritt/Uptown District Associations&lt;ref&gt;http://uptownoakland.localon.com&lt;/ref&gt; are community benefit districts that were formed in February 2009. Property owners in both Downtown Oakland and the Lake Merritt/Uptown Districts voted by a margin of almost 8 to 1 to support a voluntary property tax to fund services that would improve the quality of life in their respective communities. The associations meet and function jointly. Services funded by these Districts include maintaining cleanliness and order in the public rights of way, improving district identity and advocating on behalf of the area's property owners, business owners and residents.  In June 2013, the districts were recognized by the International Downtown Association (IDA) and named the IDA's June Downtown of the Month.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ida-downtown.org/eweb/dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=DTOM_June&lt;/ref&gt;

The district boards have three organizational committees,&lt;ref&gt;http://lakemerritt-uptown.org/Committees&lt;/ref&gt; including the DISI (District Identity and Street Improvement) Committee, the SOBO (Sidewalk Operations, Beautification &amp; Order) Committee and the Joint ORG (Organization) Committee. The DISI Committee promotes the identity of the districts, encourages economic development and works to createa vibrant downtown through public relations, marketing, and special events.  The SOBO Committee oversees cleanliness and order in the public rights of way and manages service providers in keeping with the expectations of our organization and the needs of the community. Through diligent planning and thoughtful allocation of resources, the SOBO committee executes projects that effectively beautify and enhance the safety of the districts for the long term, creating vibrant and celebrated public spaces.  And lastly, the Joint Organization Committee oversees the general administration of the corporations, ensures the effective operationsof the board, acts as the coordinating framework through which the other committees function efficiently, and works to increase involvement and supportfor the organizations.

The districts have helped fund several neighborhood beautification/improvement projects &amp; initiatives including: The Latham Square pedestrian plaza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-s-Latham-Square-becomes-pedestrian-plaza-4716391.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105052956/http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-s-Latham-Square-becomes-pedestrian-plaza-4716391.php |archivedate=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; back of BART planter boxes, hanging flower baskets &amp; banners&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bisnow.com/commercial-real-estate/san-francisco/oaklands-a-for-activity/&lt;/ref&gt; and median landscaping projects, to name a few.

==Historic districts==
The [[Downtown Oakland Historic District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1998. The listing included 43 [[contributing buildings]], one [[contributing site]] and one [[contributing object]].&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=98000813}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Downtown Oakland Historic District |author=Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey |date=January 23, 1998 |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=98000813|title=accompanying photos|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other historic districts have been designated in Old Oakland: the Lakeside Apartments district, Preservation Park, and the Waterfront [[Warehouse district]].

'''Fawaz Abdullah Zureikat''' or '''Zuraiqat''' or '''Zurayqat''' and other variations (born 1955 – died 2010) was a Jordanian businessman.

Zureikat was implicated in the [[United Nations]] [[Oil for Food]] scandal relating to corruption surrounding [[Iraq]]'s oil exports. In the 2004 [[Duelfer Report]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/pdf/duelfer1_eab.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Zureikat is identified as receiving oil allocations from Iraq via Middle East Semi Conductors Co. In other documents, another company – Aredio Petroleum – is also linked to Zureikat. He had been doing business in Iraq since 1986, and his brother Hatem has been a political prisoner in [[Syria]] since 1981 who once shared a cell with [[Tariq Aziz]].

For a time he was station manager of Arab Television (ATV), a short-lived English-language satellite channel with offices in London and Baghdad which filmed and distributed the worldwide rights to the pre-[[Iraq War]] interview conducted in Baghdad between [[Tony Benn]] and [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/my-fun-nights-out-with-georges-friend-6146182.html |title=My fun nights out with George's friend |author=Jonathan Elliott |date=15 May 2005 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a member of the [[National Mobilization Committee for the Defense of Iraq]] (NMCDI), based in Jordan, and a passionate opponent of sanctions on Iraq. He was arrested on 3 March 2003 in [[Amman]] by [[General Intelligence Directorate (Jordan)|The Jordanian intelligence services]], along with other prominent businessmen who had financial links with Saddam Hussein's regime. He was later released.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

'''Francesco "Franco" Macri''' (born 15 April 1930) is an [[Italian Argentine]] businessman and father of the Argentine president [[Mauricio Macri]].

==Life and times==
===Childhood in Italy===
Franco Macri was born in [[Rome]], to Giorgio Macri and Lea Garbini.&lt;ref name=repubblica&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallori|first1=Paolo|title=Argentina: Mauricio Macri, la saga familiare tra un accento perduto e una "y"|url=http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2015/11/24/news/argentina_mauricio_macri_saga_familiare-127983658/|website=[[La Repubblica]]|publisher=Divisione Stampa Nazionale - Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso|language=italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother belonged to a prosperous local family, proprietors of an [[intercity bus]] service and supporters of Fascist Dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]. His father, in turn, was born to a family of fallen nobility from the [[Calabria]] Region of [[Italy]]. Opponents of ''il Duce'', their kinship to the powerful Pellicano clan allowed them to retain a small [[postal service]] carrier in the area around [[San Giorgio Morgeto]].&lt;ref name=repubblica/&gt; The eight-year-old Franco and his two younger siblings were sent to a [[military school]] in 1938, following their parents' divorce two years earlier, a common fate for the children of divorced couples under [[Italian Fascism]]; they were reunited with their father in [[Genoa]] five years later.&lt;ref name=ale&gt;Ale, Ana.

===Arrival in Argentina===
The [[birth of the Italian Republic]] prompted Giorgio Macri to enter politics, by which he co-founded a nationalist party, ''[[Uomo Qualunque Front|L'Uomo Qualunque]]'' ("The Common Man"), ahead of the [[Italian general election, 1946|general elections in June 1946]]; following the party's poor showing, however, he departed for [[Buenos Aires]], settling in the western suburb of [[San Justo, Buenos Aires|San Justo]]. He later obtained housing in the [[Eva Perón Foundation]]'s [[Ciudad Evita]] community, and was joined by his three children in January 1949. Franco Macri found work in as a construction laborer; he was promoted quickly and held an administrative post within a year, later earning his secondary school diploma at the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]] and, in 1950, establishing a [[construction]] firm, Urbana.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

Obtaining a number of small, public contracts, Urbana ultimately failed, and Macri entered into a partnership, Vimac, in 1953. The firm was boosted by a lucrative contract from [[Loma Negra]], the leading Argentine [[cement]] producer, for the construction of a new plant near [[Tandil]] in 1955. He married Alicia Blanco Villegas, the daughter of a prominent Tandil physician, in 1958, relocated to [[Mar del Plata]], and had the first of their four children, Mauricio, in 1959.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

===Leading contractor===
Macri started a [[home builder]], Demaco, and purchased a tony Buenos Aires apartment facing Vicente López Plaza (in the heart of the upscale [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]] district). The 1962 installation of ultraconservative Economy Minister [[Alvaro Alsogaray]], however, and the latter's policy of paying state contractors and employees with worthless "Ninth of July Bonds" led to Vimac's closure.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

Joined by two investors and aided by an economic recovery, in 1964 he fused Demaco with the remains of Vimac to establish Impresit-Sideco. The firm secured a coveted contract with Italian automaker [[Fiat]], for the construction and maintenance of their [[Caseros, Buenos Aires|Caseros]] factory, and quickly became a leading [[public works]] contractor, notably in the construction of the [[General Belgrano Bridge]], the [[Atucha I Nuclear Power Plant|Atucha I]] and [[Embalse nuclear power plant]]s (Latin America's first), as well as in private works, such as an [[AGIP]] [[gas pipeline]] and the [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Catalinas Norte]] office park.&lt;ref name=konex&gt;[http://www.fundacionkonex.com.ar/premios/curriculum.asp?id=1448 Fundación Konex: Francisco Macri {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inheriting his father's interest in film (the elder Macri had worked for the iconic [[Cinecittà]] Studios), he also established MBC, which produced [[Argentine cinema|cinema]] for local directors [[Leopoldo Torre Nilsson]] and [[Alejandro Doria]], among others.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

Having had completed over 30 major public works projects worth over US$1.8 billion since 1964, Macri acquired [[Philco]] and [[NEC]]'s Argentine affiliates and gained controlling interest in Impresit and established Socma, a [[holding company]] for his various interests, in 1976.&lt;ref name=konex/&gt; The installation of the [[National Reorganization Process|last dictatorship]] that year, and their appointment of Buenos Aires Mayor [[Osvaldo Cacciatore]] led to the closure of the city's tens of thousands of apartment building [[incinerator]]s, whose noxious disposal of the city's 3,000 daily tons of refuse had been worsening air quality for decades. Cacciatore had them replaced in 1979 with curbside pickup service awarded to ''Manliba'', a consortium between Impresit-Sideco and [[Waste Management, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/08/29/laciudad/h-01987895.htm ''Clarín'' (8/29/2009) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macri's marriage ended in separation in 1980 (no provision existed in Argentina for divorce until 1987), and in 1982 he married Cristina Cressier, with whom he had his sixth child, Florencia. The collapse of the Argentine auto industry in 1981-82 allowed Macri to purchase a controlling stake in [[Sevel Argentina S.A.]], a local [[joint venture]] between Fiat and [[Peugeot]] formed in 1980. The acquisition averted the closure of the European automakers' Argentine plants, and tripled Socma's income.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

Macri's finances were undermined, however, from losses stemming from the Banco de Italia y Río de la Plata, of which he was majority shareholder between 1975 and 1980. The subsequent crisis, which resulted from the implosion of Economy Minister [[José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz]]'s financial deregulation and strong [[Peso ley|peso]] policies, also prompted Macri to take advantage of an exchange rate guarantee enacted by the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]] in 1980 for large private borrowers facing sharply higher [[U.S. dollar]] payments, a benefit granted to Sevel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavision.com.ar/ocio/interes/a_info_ert1.htm La Vision: El dólar en la Argentina {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ventures and misadventures===
He entered into a valuable [[real estate]] venture in [[New York (state)|New York]], when in 1979, developer [[Abraham Hirschfeld]] sold him a 75% stake in 30 hectares (75 acres) of [[Hudson River]]front land formerly owned by [[Penn Central]]. Planning to develop "[[Riverside South (New York City)|Lincoln West]]," a residential complex, Macri invested US$100 million in mandated public works and related expenses, but could not, ultimately, service a [[Chase (bank)|Chase Manhattan]] loan or meet the city's myriad [[zoning]] demands, selling the land to [[Donald Trump]] in 1985 for US$117 million.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

The disappointment was compounded by a heart attack in 1983, and the end of his second marriage in 1986, by which he lost custody of Florencia. He suffered serious losses during the country's repeated currency crises between 1987 and 1990, but gained from a partnership with [[BellSouth]] and [[Motorola]] to form [[Movicom]], the first large-scale Argentine [[mobile phone]] service provider.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

A supporter of [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja Province]] Governor [[Carlos Menem]] ahead of his upset victory in the 1988 [[Justicialist Party]] primaries, Macri broke from the flomboyant President when, after his [[Argentine general election, 1989|1989 election]] (which he won on a populist platform), he pursued aggressive [[free trade]] policies that undermined Sevel (by then the largest automaker in Argentina) in favor of cheaper imports.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt; [[Carlos Grosso]], Menem's appointed [[Mayor of Buenos Aires]] (a presidential prerogative until 1996), was a managerial employee of Macri's. A vocal [[Peronist]], Grosso had reportedly been spared becoming one of the "[[Desaparecidos|disappeared]]" upon his 1978 military abduction only by Macri's appeal on his behalf to Internal Affairs Minister [[Albano Harguindeguy]] and [[Apostolic Nuncio]] [[Pio Laghi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-103174-2008-04-27.html ''Página/12'' (4/27/2008) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The family was shaken by the August 23, 1991, kidnapping of [[Mauricio Macri]], Franco Macri's eldest son. Freed after two weeks in captivity for a reported ransom of US$6 million, Macri's abduction was executed by four members of the [[Policía Federal Argentina]], which has policing purview over Buenos Aires (the perpetrators were located only a decade later).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rionegro.com.ar/arch200105/l12j20.html ''Río Negro'' (5/12/2001) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sevel, the Socma Group's centerpiece at the time, initially benefitted from the boom touched of by Economy Minister [[Domingo Cavallo]]'s [[Argentine Currency Board|Convertibility Plan]] in 1991, seeing its auto sales grow from 30,000 in 1990 to 200,000 in 1994.&lt;ref name=sevel&gt;[http://www.bradynet.com/docs/sevel.doc Sevel Argentina S.A.]&lt;/ref&gt; The local auto industry was hit hard, however, by the [[Mexican peso crisis]]. A fall in sales to 130,000 led the company to divest itself of the Fiat licence in 1996, and Sevel revenues fell by nearly half, to US$1.1 billion.&lt;ref name=sevel/&gt; During the Menem-era wholesale [[privatization]] drive, Macri was outmaneuvered in a 1997 bid for the management of the nation's 33 main [http://www.aa2000.com.ar/aeropuertos.aspx airports] by [[Eduardo Eurnekian]], though Socma was sold the national [[Communications of Argentina#Post|postal service]] in July 1997. Sevel was eventually liquidated, rescinding its Peugeot licence in March 2000, well into the [[Argentine economic crisis]], and the Socma Group's global revenues fell from US$4.5 billion in 1994 to US$2 billion in 2001.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt; Following Sevel's liquidation, Macri was convicted of [[customs duty]] evasion relating to an auto export-import scheme via neighboring [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=38149 ''La Nación'' (10/24/2000) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Macri, a fan of the [[Boca Juniors]] football club since the 1950s, has had a commercial relationship with it for almost as long, dating from his 1960 partnership in a small [[insurance]] firm with the club's president at the time, Alberto Armando. He leveraged this to promote his elder son, Mauricio, as president of the club in 1992, though he was defeated by the incumbent, Antonio Alegre (credited with saving the club from insolvency in the 1980s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ole.clarin.com/notas/2008/01/03/01576706.html ''Olé'' (1/3/2008) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Macri was elected in 1995, however, and caused controversy by earmarking a multi-million dollar renovation of the ''[[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|Bombonera]]'' stadium, and granting the contract to Impresit (Macri's construction firm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labotellaalmar.com/vercorreo_lector.php?id=1666 ''La Botella del Mar'' (11/8/2005) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Florencia, Macri's youngest daughter, was kidnapped on April 30, 2003, and freed a week later after a ransom of nearly a million dollars was reportedly paid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americaeconomica.com/numeros4/211/noticias/chfrancomacrilu.htm ''América Economica'' (5/6/2003) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The federal postal service contract with Socma, through ''Correos Argentinos'', was rescinded, citing the company's debt to taxpayers of US$296 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=547207 ''La Nación'' (11/21/2003) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pago Fácil'', the [[electronic funds transfer]] service operated by Socma, became one of the group's leading firms, processing over 7 million payments a month. Among the group's most significant real estate developments after 2004 was the [[Mulieris towers]], in Buenos Aires' [[Puerto Madero]] district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francomacri.com/home.php Franco Macri: presente]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macri returned to the auto industry in 2007, when he obtained licensing to produce [[Chery]] automobiles, as well as their parts, which would be assembled in Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieco.clarin.com/notas/2007/12/04/01556659.html ''iEco'' (12/4/2007) {{es icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213145805/http://www.ieco.clarin.com/notas/2007/12/04/01556659.html |date=2009-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Mauricio, was elected Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2007, and in 2008, the 78-year-old Macri divested Socma of two of its most important firms, Iecsa (construction) and Creaurban (real estate), in favor of Angelo Calcaterra, his nephew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-101109-2008-03-22.html ''Página/12'' (3/22/2008) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Chery Socma, the joint venture with the [[Chinese automobile industry|Chinese automaker]], exported its first units in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larepublica.com.uy/economia/379381-chery-socma-comenzo-a-exportar ''La república'' (9/5/2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macri published a reflection on his over half-century as an Argentine businessman, ''El futuro es posible'', in 2004; he still keeps the suitcase with which he arrived in Argentina in 1949.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

== Panama Papers scandal ==
{{Main article|Panama Papers}}
In April 2016, following the leak to German newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' of 11 million documents belonging to Panamanian [[law firm]] [[Mossack Fonseca]], the leaked [[Panama Papers]] revealed that Macri was [[List of people named in the Panama Papers|listed]] as director of a Bahamas-based trading company that he did not disclose during his tenure as Mayor of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fusion.net/story/287227/famous-presidents-shell-companies-trove/ |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |title=Here are the famous politicos in 'the Wikileaks of the mega-rich' |author=Fusion Investigative Unit |date=April 3, 2016 |work=[[Fusion (TV channel)|Fusion]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gV2Vu0h3?url=http://fusion.net/story/287227/famous-presidents-shell-companies-trove/ |archivedate=April 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/the-panama-papers-massive-leak-reveals-the-global-elites-secret-cash-havens|title=The Panama Papers: Massive Leak Reveals the Global Elite's Secret Cash Havens {{!}} VICE News|website=VICE News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529034715/https://news.vice.com/article/the-panama-papers-massive-leak-reveals-the-global-elites-secret-cash-havens|archivedate=2016-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/04/04/secret-panamapapers-files-who-did-what/82599656/|title=Panama Papers: Who's accused of what|website=USA TODAY|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the Panama Papers made the news, Macri appeared in a short TV interview in which he said his father, Franco Macri, had founded the company through a "legal operation". He added that the company had been intended to carry out investment operations in Brazil but the business was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-argentina-idUSKCN0X1202|title=Argentina's Macri denies wrongdoing at 'Panama Papers' offshore firm|date=2016-04-04|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Joaquín Morales Solá]] considered it unlikely that Macri would be prosecuted for the Panama revelations. Macri appears himself in the directory, Franco Macri had reported it to the AFIP, and it was closed in 2008, just a year after Mauricio Macri became chief of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1886614-el-final-de-un-ciclo-impune|title= El final de un ciclo impune|trans-title=The end of a cycle of impunity|language= Spanish|author= Joaquín Morales Solá|date= April 6, 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2016, federal prosecutor Federico Delgado began a formal investigation into Macri's involvement with Fleg Trading Ltd., the company registered in Panama for which President Macri was listed as director. Judge Sebastián Casanello was asked to start the file on the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1913658-panama-papers-el-juez-casanello-ordenan-un-analisis-comparativo-sobre-las-declaraciones-juradas-de-mauricio-macri|title= Panamá Papers: el juez Casanello ordenó un análisis comparativo sobre las declaraciones juradas de Mauricio Macri|trans-title=Panama Papers: judge Casanello ordered a comparative analysis of Mauricio Macri's sworn wealth|language= Spanish|author= Paz Rodríguez Niell|date= June 29, 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial petition was made by Norman Martínez, deputee for the [[Front for Victory]]. Martínez claims Macri could be guilty of perjury due to omissions made in his sworn statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1887050-imputaron-a-mauricio-macri-por-su-participacion-en-una-sociedad-offshore|title=Panamá Papers: imputaron a Mauricio Macri por su participación en una sociedad offshore|website=www.lanacion.com.ar|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martínez also referenced another offshore company, Kagemusha SA, which had been established in 1981 and to which President Macri also had connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1885839-macri-fue-director-de-una-sociedad-offshore-de-bahamas|title=Macri fue director de una sociedad offshore de Bahamas|website=www.lanacion.com.ar|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/politica/Mauricio-Macri-aparece-como-director-una-segunda-empresa-offshore-20160404-0029.html|title=Macri offshore: aparece una segunda empresa del presidente en Panamá - Perfil.com|website=Perfil.com|language=es-LA|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giovanni Battista Giorgini, prima sfilata di alta moda italiana.jpg|thumb|villa Torrigiani, via dei Serragli, Firenze ([[Giardino Torrigiani]])]]
'''Giovanni Battista Giorgini''' (Forte dei Marmi, 25 August 1898 - Florence, 2 January 1971), was an Italian entrepreneur and member of the Giorgini family.

==Early life and family==
Giovanni Battista Giorgini, the Giorgini family descends from a noble family from Lucca. His great-grandfather Charles was a member of the Kingdom of Italy and was the brother of Senator Giovanni Battista Giorgini and brother-in-law of Vittoria Manzoni, the eighth daughter of Alessandro Manzoni. His father, Vittorio Giorgini (1860-1919) helped his brother Alessandro in the family business dedicated to the marble trade, but he had an artistic spirit. The mother, Florence Rochat (1860-1942) was Waldensian and originally from Francophone Switzerland. The boy grew up in a cultured and cosmopolitan environment and undertook classical studies at the University of Pisa.

At the age of 17, he followed his family footsteps and enrolled as a volunteer in infantry to participate in the First World War. Impressed by the horrors of the war promoted the Christian Youth Association, equivalent to the evangelical organization "Young Men's Christian Association" (YMCA).

In 1921 he married Zaira Augusta Nanni with whom he had three children: Graziella, Vittorio and Matilde.

==Career==
The following year he moved to Florence where he decided to start his own business by opening the "GB Giorgini &amp; Co. Import-export" in via Calzaioli 9. He actively promotes Tuscan art, antiques and crafts, and in 1924 he will make his first commercial trip to the United States. This trip was particularly painful because at the time Italian exporters were not well seen overseas. He decided to develop contacts with the "Italian House of Columbia University", "Italy America Society" and the YMCA and at the same time he selected a high quality Italian craftsmanship.

The crack of 1929 gave a heavy blow to his work and forced him to close his New York office. The years that followed were very unstable until the end of the Second World War , when the allies entrusted him with the management of the "Allied Forces Gift Shop" of Florence, a pole in charge of selling products to Anglo-American troops. In those years he quickly resumed contact with all the Italian artisans with whom he had worked before the war, and of course with the American buyers.

Skillful businessman immediately sees the potential of Italian fashion, then almost unknown in the world. Everything took place in Paris, where the few non-French designers opened their Ateliers ( Cristobal Balenciaga , Elsa Schiaparelli , etc.). Giovanni Battista Giorgini took the initiative to organize the "First Italian High Fashion Show" at his private residence in Florence at Villa Torrigiani. The parade was held February 12, 1951 in the presence of six major American buyers, who, as he himself said in various interviews, went to Florence as a simple courtesy visit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kE8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 "Italy gets dressed up"], ''[[LIFE]]'', 20 August 1951, pp. 104-112 (p. 105).&lt;/ref&gt; It was: Gertrude Ziminsky for B. Altman and Company of New York, John Nixon for Henry Morgan of Montreal, Ethel Francau, Jessica Daves and Julia Trissel for Bergdorf Goodman of New York, Stella Hanania for I. Magnin of San Francisco. Giorgini had planned to present 18 models of 10 Italian fashion houses. Among those who presented their models there were: the atelier Carosa (of the princess Giovanna Caracciolo), Alberto Fabiani , the atelier Simonetta (of the Duchess Simonetta Colonna Visconti ), Emilio Schuberth the Sorelle Fontana , Jole Veneziani , the tailor Vanna (of Manette Valente), Vita Noberasko and Germana Marucelli . They were added for theprêt-à-porter Emilio Pucci , Giorgio Avolio, The weaver of the Island (of the baroness Clarette Gallotti) and Mirsa (of the marquise Olga of Gresy). Giorgini's resourcefulness, the quality of the products, the buyers' reputation and the support of some journalists like Irene Brin , who as Italian editor for Harper's Bazaar advertised the event overseas, decreed its success.

It was a very exceptional event, because from that moment it really began to talk about Italian fashion. The second parade was held in July 1951 in the halls of the "Grand Hotel" in Florence. Since 1952, two seasons of fashion shows have been organized in the Sala Bianca of Palazzo Pitti , one in January and the other in July. In 1954 the Florence Center for Italian fashion was born, with its first director Mario Vannini Parenti.

In the 1960s, he succeeded in conquering the Japanese market, selling Italian creations to "Isetan", one of the most important department stores in the country. Sensing also the importance of prêt-à-porter manages to introduce him in the Florentine fashion shows, but this will be a cause of conflict with the great Roman fashion houses that will decide in 1967 to create Haute Couture fashion shows directly in Rome.

==Death and legacy==
Giorgini died on January 2, 1971 in Florence, at Villa Torrigiani (that of the Torrigiani Garden), and was buried in the Cemetery of the Allori in via Senese.

His personal archive was filed in 2005 by his nephew Neri Fadigati at the Florence State Archives.

'''Gregorio Perez Companc''' (born August 23, 1934) also known as "Don Gregorio" or "Goyo," is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] businessman and one of Argentina's wealthiest individuals, with an estimated net worth of [[US dollar|US$]]1.6 billion as of October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/profile/gregorio-perez-companc/?list=billionaires&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
He was born Jorge Gregorio Bazán in [[Buenos Aires]], in 1934. He was adopted in 1945 by Margarita Companc de Pérez Acuña, a local socialite, and enrolled at the La Salle [[college preparatory school]], though he left before graduating. He married Maria del Carmen "Munchi" Sundblad Beccar Varela, an heiress, in 1964, and in 1968, was named director of the [[Banco Santander Río|Banco Río de La Plata]] (at the time of the country's largest, private-sector banks), following its purchase by his family. He built much of his fortune, however, as head of Petrolera Pérez Companc, a family-based [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] in [[oil]] and [[gas]] that was first established by Gregorio's adoptive father in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Majul, Luis. ''Los Dueños de la Argentina''. Editorial Sudamericana, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pérez Companc purchased a controlling stake in Banco Río de la Plata from his siblings in 1993, and would sell his shares to Spanish banking giant [[Banco Santander]] in 1997. Between 1990 and 1994, the company expanded its domestic activities in the oil business and in a number of other industries through participation in the country's [[privatization]] programme initiated by President [[Carlos Menem]].&lt;ref&gt;Case Study on outward foreign direct investment from Argentina. ''UN Conference on Trade and Development'', October 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996, Pérez Companc S.A. had consolidated sales of US$1.41 billion. The family strengthened its hand in 1998 by forming a new public [[holding company]], PC Holdings S.A., and later that year, acquired a 68% share in local food giant [[Molinos Río de la Plata]] from the traditional agribusiness house, [[Bunge y Born]], for US$380 million. Molinos Río de la Plata, which sells Luchetti's pasta, Cocinero oils and Nobleza Gaucha [[yerba mate]] (among numerous brands), is one of Argentina's leading processed foods companies, earning roughly US$850 million in revenues in 2009.

=== Transition into the 21st century ===
In 1999, [[shareholders]] in Pérez Companc S.A. exchanged their voting shares for nonvoting shares (Class B shares) in PC Holdings S.A.: this raised some concern from financial and political analyst, since in such a transaction the controlling shareholders would have multiple vote shares to ensure their continuing voting control. However, the Comision Nacional de Valores approved the exchange, thus allowing the Pérez Companc family to own 58% of the company with 80% voting control.&lt;ref&gt;Mariano F. Grondona, Major Corporate Events - Delisting and changes in the Capital Structure. ''[[OECD]]'', March 30, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Argentine economic crisis]] produced numerous problems for the country's energy sector, and 1999 revenues for Petrolera Pérez Companc declined 3% to US$1.27 billion. The family also sold their 19% stake in Banco Río de la Plata during 1999. In a year that saw the Argentine economy shaken by the worst economic turmoil in over a century, Pérez Companc continued to oversee growth in the family's business concerns: the value of the group's consolidated energy, food processing and financial services portfolio grew a healthy 20% during 2001.&lt;ref&gt;''Forbes'' World's Richest People, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored a big coup in October 2002 when he announced the sale of the family's 60% share of Petrolera Pérez Companc to [[Brazil]]ian oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. ([[Petrobras]]) for a reported US$1 billion in cash and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].

== Personal life ==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
Gregorio Pérez Companc and his wife, María del Carmen Sundblad Beccar Varela, have eight children Margarita, Jorge, [[Luis Pérez Companc|Luis]], Rosario, Pilar, Cecilia, [[Pablo Pérez Companc|Pablo]] and Catalina, with sons Luís and Jorge helping their parents run Molinos Río de la Plata. The family is deeply religious and have donated generously to [[Catholic Charities]] over the years. 

In late 2007 Gregorio's sister-in-law, the well-known interior designer María-Migdalia Perez-Soto, died unexpectedly in her mansion in Coral Gables, leaving in question control over the Pérez Companc Investment Group. María-Migdalia, held an 80% stake in the group, with her untimely death, her eldest son Richard Rodriguez-Mendez obtained control and later dissolved it. Richard Rodriguez-Mendez did keep his mother's prized possession Interior Design Firm- Design by Interior's which is currently managed by Getty Designs and is estimated to be worth $600 million. In early 2010 Richard Rodriguez-Mendez reclaimed full control and ownership over the Rafael Rodriguez-Mendez Trust who died in 2009, its real estate portfolio alone was valued at $650 million. The long battle between brother's ended up with one brother receiving 3% of the estate and the recluse Richard Rodriguez-Mendez with the majority stake of 97%. 

Since 2010 the Rodriguez-Mendez Trust has grown in size, a conservative estimate puts the Trust at somewhere between $1.7 billion dollars and $2.1 billion dollars but some believe that the Estate which is managed by 5 independent banking firm in name of Richard Rodriguez-Mendez and his 5 heirs put it in the $5 billion dollar range. A lot of question have arisen since it was announced the Rodriguez Mendez relapsed with throat cancer after a long battle of chemotherapy in 2000, It is not sure what the true estimate of the estate is worth due to the secrecy of the Rodriguez Trust and its all of Richard Rodriguez-Mendez heirs. While his grandmother sits atop with estimated worth of around $9.8 Billion dollar fortune, Rodriguez-Mendez controls and manages all his assets behind a shell of multiple banking firms and there is no indication that he has a Will and if so who will manage the estate that he has doubled in size. 

Gregorio and his wife raise [[Jersey cattle|Jersey dairy cows]] and operate Munchi's, a small chain of [[Ice cream parlor|ice cream parlors]]. Long known for his love of modern and vintage cars, he reportedly owns a [[Bugatti]], a [[Maserati]], a limited-edition [[Ferrari F50]],&lt;ref&gt;''Forbes'' World's Richest People, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and the unique [[Ferrari 330 TRI/LM]] racing car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/0808.330TRI.htm|title=330 TRI LM s/n 0808|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregorio is also the uncle of billionare heir Richard Rodríguez-Méndez and Roy Rodrigo Rodriguez Mendez by his aunt, María Carmen. Roy Rodrigo committed suicide on February 6, 2015, in his jail cell in [[Madrid|Madrid, Spain]] where he was serving a 4 and-a-half years prison term. Richard Rodríguez-Méndez is an avid buyer of real estate, to date he owns 15 properties some of which are among the largest homes in the world. His real estate portfolio is estimated to be worth nearly $200 million; he also collects art: in his collection he has works by Pierre Bonnard's "Terrasse a Vernon" which sold for £7.2 million ($11.6 million) at an auction, as well as Cézanne's Portrait of Mme Cézanne. His private art collection also includes his great-grandmother's work Marie Spartali-Stillman, A Rose from Armida's Garden and other pieces, all valued at over $400 million.

This is a list of articles about [[terms of service]] and [[privacy policies]]. These are also called terms of use, and are rules one must agree to, in order to use a service. The articles fall in two main categories: descriptions of terms used for specific companies or products, and descriptions of different kinds of terms in general. Articles on companies vary widely in the amount of detail they give on terms of service. Annotations show what is available in the article on each company, and need to be updated as those articles are improved.

Terms of service are regularly the subject of news articles throughout the English-language press, such as in the US,&lt;ref name="ny14"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/upshot/one-third-of-top-websites-restrict-customers-right-to-sue.html |title=One-Third of Top Websites Restrict Customers' Right to Sue |last=Merrill |first=Jeremy B. |date=23 October 2014 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny17"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html |title=How Uber Deceives the Authorities Worldwide |last=Isaac |first=Mike |date=3 March 2017 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ti12"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://business.time.com/2012/08/28/7-surprising-things-lurking-in-online-terms-of-service-agreements/ |title=7 Surprising Things Lurking in Online 'Terms of Service' Agreements |last=Luckerson |first=Victor |work=Time |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US |issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/story/zoe-quinn-crash-override-book-excerpt/ |title=Book Excerpt: Zoë Quinn on the Problem of Terms of Service |last=Quinn |first=Zoe |date=9 September 2017 |work=WIRED |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK,&lt;ref name="gu17"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/03/terms-of-service-online-contracts-fine-print |title=Click to agree with what?

'''ICMA''' (International City/County Management Association) (originally International City Managers' Association)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://etext.ku.edu/view?docId=ksrlead/ksrl.kc.internationalcitycounty.xml;route=ksrlead;brand=ksrlead;query= |title= Guide to the ICMA Collection - International City/County Management Association records, 1900-2010 |publisher= University of Kansas Libraries |date= 2010 |accessdate= June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an association representing professionals in [[local government]] management. It is based in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States|USA]].

Founded in 1914 as the International City Managers Association, ICMA provides education and networking opportunities for its members, and offers the Credentialed Manager program to offer professional [[credential]]ing to [[city manager|city and county executive managers]]. It also conducts research, provides technical assistance and training, and promotes professional local government management.&lt;ref name="icma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icma.org/main/bc.asp?bcid=60&amp;hsid=1&amp;ssid1=17|title=About ICMA|accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICMA Voluntary Credentialing Program recognizes professional local government managers qualified by a combination of education and experience, adherence to high standards of integrity, and an assessed commitment to lifelong learning and professional development. Managers are recognized by ICMA through a peer review credentialing process, and this self-directed program offers an opportunity for interested ICMA members to quantify the unique expertise they bring to their communities. The program also assists ICMA members in focusing and reflecting upon their lifelong professional development experience. Members who participate in the program may earn the designation of ICMA Credentialed Manager granted by the ICMA Executive Board.

The ICMA is considered part of the '[[Big Seven (United States)|Big Seven]]', a group of organisations that represent local and state government in the United States.

The '''International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations''' (or '''FIATA''',  {{lang-fr|Fédération Internationale des Associations de Transitaires et Assimilés}}) is a [[non-governmental organization]] representing 40,000 forwarding and logistics companies, employing 8 to 10 million people in 150 countries.

==History and organization==
It was founded in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], on 31 May 1926.

FIATA has consultative status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) (''inter alia'' [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|ECE]], [[ESCAP]], [[ESCWA]]), the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), and the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] (UNCITRAL).

It is recognised as representing the [[freight forwarding|freight-forwarding]] industry by many other governmental organisations, governmental authorities, private international organisations in the field of transport such as the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC), the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA), the [[International Union of Railways]] (UIC), the [[International Road and Transport Union]] (IRU), the [[World Customs Organization]] (WCO), the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), etc.

==FIATA Foundation==
Just before the World Congress 2001 in [[Cancún]], [[Quintana Roo]], [[Mexico]], and on the occasion of FIATA's 75th anniversary, the presidency of FIATA decided to mark this particular event with the creation of the FIATA Foundation Vocational Training, an institution which aims to assist associations in less-privileged countries to build up and enhance professional skill in the industry.

The management committee of the foundation coordinates the fundraising activities, evaluates the applications for funds and helps the associations on the implementation of Training projects.

==Documents==
FIATA has created several documents and forms to establish a uniform standard for use by freight forwarders worldwide. The documents are easily distinguishable as each has a distinctive colour and carries the FIATA logo which can be seen at the head of this page.

==Business career==
In 1971, he worked for the Israel Discount Bank – which was founded by his grandfather, [[Leon Yehuda Recanati]]. In 1979, he was appointed deputy CEO with responsibility for all branches and marketing. He largely escaped the scandal of the [[1983 Israel bank stock crisis]].&lt;ref name="ha081012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lipson|first1=Nathan|title=The Losses of Leon Recanati|url=https://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/the-losses-of-leon-recanati-1.259224|accessdate=24 December 2017|publisher=Haaretz|date=October 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986, he transferred to IDB Holding, the investment side of the family business where he rotated through various chairmanships at [[Shufersal|Supersol]], [[Delek]] and Clal, and later served as co-CEO and co-chairman of IDB Holding.&lt;ref name=JewishVirtualLibrary /&gt;

In May 2003, the family sold IDB Holding to [[Nochi Dankner]]&lt;ref name=HaaretzLosses&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/the-losses-of-leon-recanati-1.259224 Haaretz: "The losses of Leon Recanati - He had it all: money, prestige - but the scion of the banking family wanted more" By Nathan Lipson] December 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and divided its assets. With his share, Recanati established Glenrock, an investment company,  which he ran with his wife Shula Recanati and Ziv Kop.&lt;ref name=HaaretzLosses /&gt; It has three divisions: ''GlenRock America'' assists Israeli businesses in entering the American market and also serves as a conduit for American investors to invest in Israel (headed by Larry Graev); ''GlenRock Israel'' invests in local technology companies; and ''GlenRock Italy'' advises Israeli businesses in penetrating the Italian market and serves as a bridge for Italian investors interested in investing in Israel (headed by Rony Benatof).&lt;ref name=JewishVirtualLibrary /&gt;

In 2007, he purchased a 50.4% stake (73% total with two minority partners) in the Gmul Investment Company for NIS 600 million more than twice its market capitalization. Gmul had stakes in real estate, hotels, investments, and automotive. It was founded in 1950 by Bank Hapoalim, the Histadrut labor federation and several pension funds then sold to the brothers Jules and Eddy Trump, who listed it on the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]], and then sold in October 2003 to Eyal Yona and Amnon Barzilay.&lt;ref name=HaaretzLosses /&gt; Performance at Gmul deteriorated. Recanati stated: "At this point I can say that buying control of Gmul was the worst deal I have ever made... I cannot invest any more in Gmul, but I hope that we can all work together to find a solution and reach a fair, mutually agreed-upon arrangement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/recanati-buying-gmul-was-the-worst-deal-in-my-life-1.259223 Haaretz: "Recanati: 'Buying Gmul was the worst deal in my life' -Leumi is demanding immediate repayment of NIS 5 million in loans" By Michael Rochvarger and Yuval Maoz] December 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, he sold half of his 50.4% investment in Gmul to Itzhak Gvilli for NIS 20 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/business/cutting-his-losses-recanati-sells-half-his-stake-in-gmul-1.388460 Haaretz: "Recanati Cutting his losses / Recanati sells half his stake in Gmul - Leon Recanati, through his privately owned company Legov, sells 25.2% of the company's stock, representing half his 50.4% stake, along with a share in control to CPA Itzhak Gvilli for up to NIS 20 million" By Michael Rochvarger] October 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned as chairman of Gmul in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/finance/stocks/GMUL.TA/key-developments/article/2594497 Reuters: GMUL Investment Company Ltd Announces Resignation of Chairman, Mr. Leon Recanati] July 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4462">A '''line splice''' is a special type of connection of [[electrical cable]]s ('''electrical splice''') or [[optical fiber]]s ('''optical splice''') in [[telecommunication technology]].

Splices are often housed in [[Sleeve (construction)|sleeve]]s to protect against external influences.

=={{anchor|Electrical splice}}Splicing of copper wires==

[[Image:Kabelmuffe Blei2 600 565.jpg|thumb|Insulating sleeves]]

The splicing of copper wires happens in the following steps:

* The cores are laid one above the other at the junction.
* The wires are wrapped two to three times around each other ([[Transposition (telecommunications)|twisting]]).
* The core insulation is removed.
* The bare veins on a length of about 3&amp;nbsp;cm "strangle" or "twist". In some cases, the strangulation is soldered.
* To isolate the splice, an insulating sleeve made of paper or plastic is pushed over it.

The splicing of copper wires is mainly used on paper insulated wires.

LSA techniques (LSA: soldering, screwing and stripping free) are used to connect copper wires, making the copper wires faster and easier to connect. LSA techniques include:

* Wire connection sleeves (AVH = Adernverbindungshülsen) and other crimp connectors. The two wires to be connected are inserted into the AVH without being stripped, which is then compressed with special pliers. The about 2&amp;nbsp;cm long AVH consist of contact, pressure and insulation.
* For wire connection strips (AVL = Adernverbindungsleisten) several pairs of wires (10 = AVL10 or 20 = AVL20) are inserted, the strip is then closed with a lid and pressed together with a hydraulic press, which ensures the connection.

[[Fiber-optic cable]]s are spliced using a special arc-splicer, with installation cables connected at their ends to respective "pigtails" - short individual fibers with [[fiber-optic connector]]s at one end. The splicer precisely adjusts the light-guiding cores of the two ends of the glass fibers to be spliced. The adjustment is done fully automatically in modern devices, whereas in older models this is carried out manually by means of micrometer screws and microscope. An experienced splicer can precisely position the fiber ends within a few seconds. Subsequently, the fibers are fused together (welded) with an electric arc. Since no additional material is added, such as gas welding or soldering, this is called a "[[fusion splice]]".

Depending on the quality of the splicing process, attenuation values at the splice points are achieved by 0.3&amp;nbsp;dB, with good splices also below 0.02&amp;nbsp;dB. For newer generation devices, alignment is done automatically by motors. Here one differentiates core and jacket centering. At core centering (usually [[single-mode fiber]]s), the fiber cores are aligned. A possible core offset with respect to the jacket is corrected. In the jacket centering (usually in multimode fibers), the fibers are adjusted to each other by means of electronic image processing in front of the splice.

When working with good equipment, the damping value is according to experience at max. 0.1&amp;nbsp;dB. Measurements are made by means of special measuring devices including [[optical time-domain reflectometry]] (OTDR). A good splice should have an attenuation of less than 0.3&amp;nbsp;dB over the entire distance. Finished fiber optic splices are housed in splice boxes.

'''Martin Fletcher Allen''' (November 28, 1842 – May 24, 1927) was a [[Vermont]] banker, businessman, farmer and politician who served one term as [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Vermont|Lieutenant Governor]].

==Early life==
Martin Fletcher Allen was born in [[Ferrisburgh, Vermont|North Ferrisburgh, Vermont]] on November 28, 1842.  He attended [[Eastman Business College]] in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] and became a merchant and store owner.  Allen was also involved in several other businesses, including banking, farms and a grist mill, in addition serving as North Ferrisburg's [[Postmaster]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3wjt3eoLPF4C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=%22martin+f+allen%22+vermont&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hpr-Ttq-Lung0QHLj72WAg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22martin%20f%20allen%22%20vermont&amp;f=false Genealogical and Family History of the State of Vermont], edited by Hiram Carleton, 1903, pages 71 to 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TaITAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=martin+allen+ferrisburgh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o5v-TtKmOaXa0QHXpejgDw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=martin%20allen%20ferrisburgh&amp;f=false Who's Who in New England], published by A.

==Political involvement==
A Republican, Allen served in the [[Vermont House of Representatives]] from 1882 to 1883 and the [[Vermont Senate]] from 1890 to 1891. He was elected Vermont's Lieutenant Governor in 1900 and served until 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Uo8eAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA230&amp;dq=martin+allen+ferrisburgh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o5v-TtKmOaXa0QHXpejgDw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=martin%20allen%20ferrisburgh&amp;f=false Magazine article, Republican nominees], The Vermonter magazine, July 1900, page 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EeV6r-D7w9oC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=martin+allen+ferrisburgh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eJz-Tq6GIefk0QH5-tCdCw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=martin%20allen%20ferrisburgh&amp;f=false Vermont: The Green Mountain State], by Walter Hill Crockett, Volume 4, 1921, page 331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011635/http://vermont-archives.org/govhistory/elect/results1/pdf/stoff2ltgov.pdf General Election results, Lieutenant Governor, 1813–2008], Office of the Vermont Secretary of State, State Archives and Records Administration, 2008, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal trial==
In May 1901 Allen was one of several officers of the Farmers' National Bank who were arrested and accused of being complicit in embezzlement by the bank's Cashier. The officers of the bank were tried in 1902 and found not guilty, while the Cashier was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/05/28/118464813.pdf Newspaper article, Vermont Official Arrested], New York Times, May 28, 1901&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/771287672.html?dids=771287672:771287672&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=May+28%2C+1901&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=ARREST+HIGH+OFFICIAL&amp;pqatl=google Arrest High Official: Lieut.

==Retirement and death==
After leaving office Allen resumed his business pursuits, remaining active until complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]] caused him to withdraw from active pursuits, after which he lived in retirement in North Ferrisburgh.  Allen died in North Ferrisburgh on May 24, 1927.  He was buried in North Ferrisburgh Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Death Records, 1909–2008, Record for Martin F.

Measurement Assisted Assembly For Large Volume Aircraft Wing Structures. in 4th International Conference on Digital Enterprise Technology. 2007. Bath, United Kingdom. p. 426-434&lt;/ref&gt; is any method of assembly in which measurements are used to guide assembly processes. Such processes include:
* '''Predictive fettling/shimming'''&lt;ref&gt;Kayani, A. and I. Gray, Shim for Arrangement Against a Structural Component and a Method of Making a Shim. 2009, Patent US20080211185 20080916, Airbus UK Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; in which component measurements are used to predict gaps and interferences prior to assembly, and these predictions are used to enable a right-first-time assembly
* '''Assemble-Measure-Move''' ('''AMM''')&lt;ref&gt;Muelaner, J.E., A. Kayani, O. Martin, and P.G. Maropoulos. Measurement Assisted Assembly and the Roadmap to Part-To-Part Assembly. in 7th International Conference on Digital Enterprise Technology. 2011. Athens, Greece, Available from http://www.muelaner.com/research/MADA/MAA_and_Roadmap_to_Part-To-Part.html&lt;/ref&gt; processes where a component is positioned approximately in an assembly, the position of the component is measured and then it is moved towards its specified position. This process may be iterated a number of times before the component is within its specified position, alternatively 'real time' measurements may be used to 'track' the component into location.
* '''Active tooling''' is a form of [[Fixture (tool)|assembly fixture]] which does not rely on inherent dimensional stability to provide an accurate location for components but rather uses frequent measurements to facilitate in active compensation.
* '''[[Control theory|Closed loop control]]''' of assembly automation in order to improve the accuracy of flexible automation systems such as [[industrial robots]].&lt;ref&gt;Summers, M., Robot Capability Test and Development of Industrial Robot Positioning System for the Aerospace Industry, in AeroTech Congress &amp; Exhibition. 2005, SAE International: Grapevine,Texas. p. 1-13&lt;/ref&gt;
Measurement-assisted assembly is typically used for large structures such as [[Airframe|aircraft]] and [[Fabrication (metal)|steel fabrications]]. It can be used to improve production rates, reduce reworking and increase flexibility for processes where manual reworking during assembly is required to maintain assembly form and component interface conditions. This type of approach generally offers no advantages where [[Interchangeable parts|part-to-part interchangeability]] can already be achieved.

'''Mid-Atlantic Sports Network''' ('''MASN''') is an American [[regional sports network]] owned as a [[joint venture]] between two [[Major League Baseball]] franchises, the [[Baltimore Orioles]] (which owns a controlling 90% interest) and the [[Washington Nationals]] (which owns the remaining 10%). Headquartered in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], the channel broadcasts regional coverage of sports events in the [[Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area]].

MASN is available on approximately 23 [[cable television|cable]] and [[optical fiber|fiber optic]] television providers in [[Maryland]], the [[District of Columbia]], [[Virginia]], eastern and central [[North Carolina]], [[West Virginia]], south central [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Delaware]] (on providers such as [[Comcast]], [[Cox Communications]], [[RCN Corporation|RCN]], [[Mediacom]], [[Charter Communications]] and [[Verizon FiOS]], covering an area stretching from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]); it is also available nationwide on [[direct broadcast satellite|satellite]] via [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]].

==History==
When the [[Montreal Expos]] relocated to Washington, D.C., in 2004 to begin play as the Nationals in [[2005 Washington Nationals season|2005]], issues arose regarding television rights for the new franchise. The Orioles have had a sizable following in the Washington area since moving from [[St. Louis]] in 1954, and have claimed Washington as part of their home territory since the [[Washington Senators (1960-1971)|second Washington Senators franchise]] became the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in [[1972 Texas Rangers season|1972]]. Since at least [[1981 Major League Baseball season|1981]], Major League Baseball had designated the Orioles' television territory as extending from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], Pennsylvania,  to [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]]. The Orioles agreed to share their territory with the Nationals in return for the ability to air Nationals games on the Orioles' planned regional sports network, to be named the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. Major League Baseball, which owned the Expos-Nationals franchise from 2002 to 2006, paid the Orioles $75 million for a 10% stake in MASN, with the Orioles maintaining a controlling interest of 90%. As part of the deal, the Nationals' stake in the network would increase by one percent per year to 33% over 23 years, at which point the increases would cease and ownership would be fixed at 67% Orioles and 33% Nationals. Under the arrangement, MASN paid the Nationals $20 million to broadcast their games in 2005, and were bound to renegotiate the amount they paid the Nationals based on the fair market value of the Nationals′ broadcast rights in 2012 and once every five years thereafter. With this settled, the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network launched on April 4, 2005.

The family of [[Lerner Enterprises]] founder [[Ted Lerner]] subsequently became part-owners in MASN after their purchase of the Washington Nationals in July 2006. The same month that the Lerners acquired minority interest in MASN, the network, which originally broadcast only during Orioles and Nationals games, converted into a 24-hour channel with an expanded roster of collegiate sports events and local and national programming. It has become a strong competitor to the area's dominant regional sports network, Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic, now known as [[NBC Sports Washington]].

==Programming==
As a whole, the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network televises more than 600 professional and [[NCAA Division I]] collegiate events annually.

===Orioles and Nationals telecasts===
The network carries live telecasts of all Orioles and Nationals games that are not televised by a national broadcast or cable network, and produces the [[pre-game show|pre-game]] and [[post-game show]]s ''Nats Xtra'' and ''O's Xtra'', which bookend the game telecasts. As with all Major League Baseball broadcasts, MASN-produced games are available for streaming out of the teams' respective territories at [http://www.mlb.tv mlb.tv], with local viewers able to watch highlights for a certain amount of time following the conclusion of each game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yankees' online viewing breakthrough|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/25/yankees-agreement-is-breakthrough-deal/|author=Tim Lemke|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=June 25, 2009|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 2017 season, MASN also produced over-the-air television broadcasts of Nationals and Orioles games for television stations in their respective primary markets – producing Nationals games seen on [[CBS]] affiliate [[WUSA-TV]] (channel 9) in Washington and Orioles games seen on CBS [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WJZ-TV]] (channel 13) in Baltimore. Those games were shown on MASN in all of the network's territory, including the Baltimore and Washington markets.

From 2008 through 2013, MASN used five broadcasters to provide simultaneous coverage of the annual [[Beltway Series]] between the Orioles and the Nationals, using the network's on-air staffs in an unconventional "mixed-booth" arrangement whenever the Orioles and Nationals played one another. Each team was represented by a color analyst and two sideline reporters for their respective telecasts, with play-by-play announcers each broadcasting for half of the game. The games were simulcast on both MASN channels (MASN and MASN2). Beginning in 2014, MASN dropped the mixed-booth format and returned to maintaining separate broadcast streams for each team during the Beltway Series, with the broadcast teams for each team again segregated as in conventional broadcasts, the home team′s feed carried on MASN, and the visiting team′s feed on MASN2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Battle of the Beltways" Kicks Off Friday on MASN |url=http://masnsports.com/2009/06/battle-of-the-beltways-kicks-o.html |website=MASNsports.com |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=December 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125022154/http://masnsports.com/2009/06/battle-of-the-beltways-kicks-o.html |archivedate=November 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College sports===
The network televises 275 collegiate sporting events each year from [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division I teams in football, basketball and lacrosse. MASN serves as the regional cable television home of [[Georgetown Hoyas]] and [[George Mason Patriots]] [[college basketball|basketball]] games, as well as [[Big East Conference (2013–present)|Big East]] and [[Big South Conference|Big South]] basketball and football, and [[Colonial Athletic Association]] basketball games, the annual [[BB&amp;T Classic]] and coaches shows for regional NCAA teams.

It also serves as an independent [[regional sports network]], carrying a sizeable amount of college sports programming distributed by various syndicators including [[college basketball]] games from the [[Atlantic-10 Conference]], [[America East Conference]], [[Big 12 Conference]], [[Mid-Atlantic Athletic Conference]], [[Northeast Conference]] and [[Southern Conference]]; [[college football]] games from the [[American Athletic Conference]], [[Ivy League]] and the [[Sunbelt Conference]]; and games from the [[American Athletic Conference]], [[Big South Conference]], [[Conference USA]], [[Mid-American Conference]], [[Patriot League]] and [[Western Athletic Conference]] in both sports.

===Other programming===
In addition to nationally distributed college sports events, MASN carries other national programming from Fox Sports Networks including [[golf]] and outdoor programs, [[horse racing]], poker,  and [[NASCAR]] events. In 2010, MASN relaunched ''The [[John Riggins]] Show'', a daily sports talk show hosted by the [[Washington Redskins]] hall of famer, who was previously with the network from 2006 to 2008. In addition to an afternoon drive program, Riggins hosted ''Riggo's Postgame Xtra'', which aired after each Redskins game.

===Former programming===
====Baltimore Ravens====
From 2006–2009, MASN began serving as the official regional cable broadcaster of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Baltimore Ravens]], televising the team's preseason games, as well as nightly airings of team-related programming (including ''Ravens Xtra'', ''1 Winning Drive'', ''The [[John Harbaugh]] Show'', ''Ravens Report'', ''Game Plan'' and ''Purple Passion'') and original live [[post-game show]]s during the regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Angelos – Peter Angelos remains a powerful paradox|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-angelos-20101002,0,7021507.story?page=1|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=October 2, 2010|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other services==
MASN served as an affiliate for the American Sports Network until it became Stadium in 2017.

===MASN2===
The network also has a companion channel, MASN2, that airs overflow games in order to accommodate both baseball teams' schedules. In September 2013, MASN2 became an affiliate of [[Fox Sports Networks]], although selected FSN-produced ACC games air on CSN Mid-Atlantic instead, and ESPNews still airs during overnight hours

===High definition===
'''MASNHD''' is a [[high-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of MASN, which broadcasts in the [[1080i]] resolution format. MASN announced that it would launch a full-time HD feed on September 16, 2008, and televise 200 Major League Baseball games in HD in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MASN to Launch Full-Time HD Channel |url=http://masnsports.com/2008/09/masn-to-launch-fulltime-hd-cha.html |website=MASNsports.com |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=December 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105082351/http://masnsports.com/2008/09/masn-to-launch-fulltime-hd-cha.html |archivedate=November 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, MASN and MASN2 have televised every Orioles and Nationals game not aired on national television in high definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MASN Announces 2010 Baseball Television Schedule |url=http://masnsports.com/2010/01/masn-announces-2010-baseball-t.html |website=MASNsports.com |date=January 21, 2010 |accessdate=December 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125022000/http://masnsports.com/2010/01/masn-announces-2010-baseball-t.html |archivedate=November 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, all sports telecasts on the network began to be [[letterbox]]ed on the network's [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] feed via the #10 [[Active Format Description]] tag format, with graphics framed for [[16:9]] widescreen displays rather than the [[4:3]] [[safe area (television)|safe area]]; games produced by MASN on WDCW and WJZ-TV utilize 4:3-optimized graphics to accommodate standard definition viewers.

==Controversies==
===Carriage controversies===

====Comcast====
After the Orioles agreed to share their television territory with the Nationals, another controversy arose with television rights. Comcast Sports Net Mid-Atlantic, the Orioles' cable partner since 1984, dating back to its days as Home Team Sports (which until 2000, was formerly co-owned with WJZ-TV under [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] and later CBS) maintained a ten-year cable television contract to broadcast Orioles games through the [[2006 Baltimore Orioles season|2006 season]]. When MASN announced plans to move Orioles broadcasts to MASN, CSN Mid-Atlantic (by then, a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast) sued the Orioles seeking enforcement of a clause in its contract with the team, which Comcast SportsNet claimed allowed them the exclusive [[right of first refusal|right of first and last refusal]] on future television contracts. MASN and the Orioles, however, claimed that MASN is a trade name for TCR Sports Broadcasting Holding, which was established in 1996 to sell all of the Orioles television rights, which resulted in the sale of the ten-year deal to HTS. Because of this, the Orioles and MASN claimed to be simply bringing their rights in-house.

On July 27, 2005, after argument by Baltimore attorney [[Arnold M. Weiner]], [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] Circuit Judge Durke G. Thompson threw out Comcast's lawsuit, ruling that the clause in Comcast's contract with the Orioles had not been triggered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge sides with Orioles over Comcast in sports network feud|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2005/07/25/daily30.html|author=Robert J. Terry|newspaper=[[Baltimore Business Journal]]|date=July 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast filed an amended complaint and on October 5, Judge Thompson threw out Comcast's second effort.

Up to that point, Comcast was the only major cable carrier that refused to carry MASN. However, as Comcast is the dominant cable provider in most of the Nationals and Orioles territory—including Baltimore and Washington themselves—this left most Nationals fans unable to see games without satellite.  Additionally, [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia Communications]] – then in the middle of [[bankruptcy]] proceedings and therefore unable to reach new carriage deals – was in the process of being sold to Comcast and [[Time Warner Cable]] on a piecemeal basis. On August 4, 2006, following a settlement, it was announced that Comcast would carry MASN starting that September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington Nationals News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|url=http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060804&amp;content_id=1593667&amp;vkey=news_was&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=was|website=[[Washington Nationals]]|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|date=August 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast was forced to drop its lawsuit under the terms of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not all getting O's new network |url=http://www.roanoke.com/sports/baseball/wb/111008 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120908135959/http://www.roanoke.com/sports/baseball/wb/111008 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 8, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Roanoke Times]] |date=November 10, 2008 |accessdate=December 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This cleared the way for the Orioles to move their games to MASN for the 2007 season.

In August 2008, MASN made a carriage complaint to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] after negotiations with Comcast did not result in a new contractual agreement. On December 23, 2009, Comcast and MASN finally settled their dispute over these systems, with the cable provider announcing plans to carry the network on systems that were not carrying it already "as early as 2010". The FCC complaint was dismissed that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comcast, MASN Settle Carriage Dispute|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/441670-Comcast_MASN_Settle_Carriage_Dispute.php?rssid=20527&amp;q=masn-|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|date=December 23, 2009|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23, 2010, MASN announced that Comcast would begin carrying the network on its central Pennsylvania systems on March 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MASN Launches on Comcast in Harrisburg on March 31 |url=http://masnsports.com/2010/03/masn-launches-on-comcast-in-ha.html |website=MASNsports.com |date=March 23, 2010 |accessdate=December 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105175706/http://masnsports.com/2010/03/masn-launches-on-comcast-in-ha.html |archivedate=November 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Time Warner Cable====
[[Time Warner Cable]], North Carolina's largest cable provider, never carried MASN on a basic cable tier on its North Carolina systems. This has resulted in the network airing a series of radio advertisements in the area asking TWC customers to ask the cable provider to add the network. On January 21, 2008, an FCC arbitrator ordered TWC to add MASN on its North Carolina systems, citing an argument that the provider was not carrying MASN in an effort to protect its own regional sports network [[Spectrum Sports (Carolinas)|Time Warner Cable Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time Warner Ordered to Carry Sports Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|url=http://www.wral.com/business/story/2334202/|website=[[WRAL-TV]]|publisher=[[Capitol Broadcasting Company]]|date=January 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time Warner Cable appealed the decision to the FCC. On October 30, 2008, the FCC's Media Bureau denied the motions filed by Time Warner Cable in its appeal, and ordered TWC to put MASN on the analog tier of its North Carolina systems within 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Order on Review|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-08-2441A1.pdf|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TWC filed another appeal for that decision, this time to the full commission. On January 16, 2009, the item was placed "on circulation" and remained there for almost two years. On December 20, 2010, the FCC voted 4-1 to grant Time Warner Cable's [[petition for review]] and reversed the Media Bureau's order. In the Memorandum Opinion and Order, it was revealed that in addition to offering carriage to MASN on a digital basic tier, TWC had "inquired into MASN's willingness to agree to carriage of MASN on an analog tier only in its Eastern North Carolina systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db1222/FCC-10-202A1.pdf |publisher=Federal Communications Commission }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This information seemed to expose TWC's apparent willingness to carry MASN on an analog tier on its systems in the [[Research Triangle|Triangle]] and [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] areas, where the Nationals and Orioles are the only "local" teams designated by Major League Baseball. In the remaining home markets that are shared with the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]]—including [[Charlotte]] and the [[Piedmont Triad]]—MASN would be carried on a digital basic tier, which is the same level of service where some Braves' games are carried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peachtree TV Affiliates &amp;#124; braves.com: Schedule|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/atl/schedule/peachtreetv_affiliates.jsp|website=[[Atlanta Braves]]|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, MASN insists on analog coverage in all areas.  As a result, Time Warner Cable refused to carry the network in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MASN News &amp; Information – Orioles, Nationals, Ravens on|url=http://www.masnsports.com/masn_news_information/masn-faqs.html|website=MASNSports.com|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; MASN's North Carolina footprint is limited to a few small cable systems scattered across the state, mostly in areas that are part of the [[Hampton Roads]] market.  This may change with TWC's acquisition by [[Charter Communications]]; indeed, Charter shut down Spectrum Sports, successor to Time Warner Cable Sports, in June 2017.

All games involving the Orioles and Nationals are [[blackout (broadcasting)|blacked out]] in most of North Carolina from all other outlets including [[MLB Network]], [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]], [[ESPN]] (for weekday games), [[MLB Extra Innings]] and MLB.tv.

==== Fibrant ====
[[Fibrant]], a municipal fiber "Internet service provider" that serves [[Salisbury, North Carolina|Salisbury]], [[North Carolina]], carried MASN at one time, but by 2015 had removed MASN because MASN wanted to charge so much that Fibrant would have had to subscription raise its rates in order to keep MASN.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/fibrant/posts/946369938728335&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington Nationals coverage===

====Broadcast practices====
Major League Baseball and Angelos struck the deal to create MASN only days before the beginning of the 2005 season, before the completion of arrangements for Washington-area cable television providers to carry MASN′s two channels (MASN and MASN2). As a result of this, many Washington, D.C.-area fans initially did not receive the new network via their cable television providers and were unable to watch most Nationals games for some time during the Nationals′ first season, leading to frustration with the network among Nationals fans.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Some Nationals fans contend that the majority ownership stake that Angelos and the Orioles hold in MASN leads the network to exhibit a bias in covering the Orioles compared to the Nationals, such as displaying the scores of Beltway Series games as "Orioles vs. Washington" – which critics see as sending a subtle message that the Orioles represent the entire Baltimore-Washington area, while the Nationals represent only Washington – as opposed to a more neutral "Orioles vs. Nationals" or "Baltimore vs. Washington."{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

====Broadcast rights fees====
When the amount MASN pays annually to the Nationals to broadcast Nationals games first came up for renegotiation in 2012, the Nationals asked for MASN to increase its annual payment to $118 million per year&lt;ref name=avisummer20180122&gt;[http://thesportsesquires.com/the-cold-stove-how-the-television-rights-dispute-between-the-baltimore-orioles-and-washington-nationals-impacts-offseason-decisions/ Summer, Avi, "The Cold Stove: How the Television Rights Dispute Between the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals Impacts Offseason Decisions," thesportsesquires.com, January 22, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; for the 2012 through 2016 seasons, while the Orioles countered with an offer averaging $39.5 million per year,&lt;ref name=avisummer20180122/&gt; arguing that the Nationals′ request was well above fair market value and in any case unaffordable for MASN, and it began paying the Nationals that amount in 2012&lt;ref name=avisummer20180122/&gt; pending agreement between MASN and the Nationals on a fee. When MASN and the Nationals could not agree on an annual amount, the Orioles and Nationals submitted the matter to Major League Baseball′s Revenue-Sharing Definitions Committee for [[Arbitration in the United States|arbitration]]. The committee issued a written decision on June 30, 2014, that MASN should pay the Nationals an average of $59 million per year for 2012 through 2016.&lt;ref name=avisummer20180122/&gt; Claiming the decision was biased against the Orioles, MASN pursued litigation on behalf of the Orioles and itself to have the committee′s decision vacated.&lt;ref name=avisummer20180122/&gt; With the matter tied up in the courts, the entire 2012-2016 period went by without a resolution of the matter,&lt;ref name=avisummer20180122/&gt; and the teams missed the next required renegotiation for the seasons from 2017 through 2021. The Nationals seek payment from MASN of over $100 million in fees each for the 2012-2016 and 2017-2021 periods,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-baseball-television-orioles-nationals/washington-nationals-get-win-over-baltimore-orioles-in-tv-rights-dispute-idUSKBN19Y2NJ Stempel, Jonathan, "Washington Nationals get win over Baltimore Orioles in TV rights dispute," FReuters, July 13, 2017, 3:50 p.m.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nationals and some of their fans contend that the delay in MASN increasing the rights fees it pays Nationals has had a negative impact on the Nationals′ revenues and their ability to sign expensive free agents.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that the animosity between the teams over this dispute may have played a role in the Orioles postponing two of a three-game home series against the [[Chicago White Sox]], playing [[2015 White Sox–Orioles crowdless game|the third game]] [[behind closed doors (sport)|without allowing fans to attend]], and moving a subsequent series with the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Rays]] to Tampa Bay due to security concerns during the [[2015 Baltimore riots|civil unrest]] in Baltimore following the [[death of Freddie Gray]] in April 2015. The Nationals were in the middle of a long road trip at the time, so [[Nationals Park]] would have been available as a nearby venue on short notice. [[Baseball commissioner]] [[Rob Manfred]] had suggested that possibility earlier in the week.&lt;ref name="WashPost 2015 riots story"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sviruga|first1=Barry|last2=Kilgore|first2=Adam|title=Orioles to host home game against the White Sox in an empty stadium|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nationals/orioles-to-host-home-game-against-the-white-sox-in-an-empty-stadium/2015/04/28/b534ea48-ede6-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 28, 2015|accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun Manfred story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Dan|title=O's-White Sox series might move out of city|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bs-sp-orioles-rob-manfred-0428-20150427-story.html|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=April 27, 2015|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Orioles spokesman would not comment on whether the teams' dispute affected the team's rescheduling decisions, but another source with the team told the ''Post'' that it had. The Nationals said that neither the Orioles nor MLB had approached them about making their stadium available. However, they never made the offer themselves.&lt;ref name="WashPost 2015 riots story" /&gt;

[[Malay styles and titles|Tan Sri]] '''Mokhzani bin Mahathir''' (born 2 January 1961) is a Malaysian businessman who has been listed as the 14th richest person in Malaysia. He worked as a petroleum engineer before founding oil-equipment fabricator Kencana Petroleum. Kencana Petroleum later merged with SapuraCrest to form SapuraKencana Petroleum. The company is now known as [[Sapura Energy]].&lt;ref name="Forbes Billionaires"/&gt;

Mokhzani was formerly a senior official in UMNO Youth, but has since retired from politics. He is the eldest son of the current [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]].

==Career==
Like his younger brother [[Mukhriz Mahathir|Mukhriz]], Mokhzani is a businessman and had played an active role in [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), and at one time serving as the Youth's Wing treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jun2001/nf20010618_117.htm Can Mahathir Run Malaysia Minus His "Alter Ego"?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2001-04/28/article9.shtml Mahathir's Son Leaves Corporate World]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, Mokhzani was an UMNO delegate of one of the constituencies in [[Kedah]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=44321 Mahathir loses bid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315092733/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=44321 |date=15 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since lain dormant in his political activities. In May 2008, he followed his father's footsteps to quit UMNO,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/5/21/nation/20080521095840&amp;sec=nation Mokhzani quits Umno (Update 2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523162626/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F5%2F21%2Fnation%2F20080521095840&amp;sec=nation |date=23 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after 22 years as a member of the Sungai Layar Hujung branch of UMNO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/5/22/nation/21321495&amp;sec=nation Mokhzani ends 22-year ties with Umno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524024040/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F5%2F22%2Fnation%2F21321495&amp;sec=nation |date=24 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Mokhzani Mahathir merged his Kencana Petroleum with SapuraCrest, run by childhood friend Shahril Shamsuddin. He stepped down from an executive role in January 2014 to concentrate on his other investments. The following month he trimmed his stake in SapuraKencana, the country's largest oil-and-gas services provider, to just over 10%, selling $248 million worth of shares. He sits on the board of not only SapuraKencana but also telecom giant Maxis and fiber-optics cable company Opcom Holdings. He's a cornerstone investor in IHH Healthcare and Astro Malaysia Holdings. But he focuses on the sector he knows best, oil and gas, where he cut his teeth as a petroleum engineer out of college. In July 2013, when news of his investment in another oil-services company, Yinson Holdings, surfaced, its stock went on a tear. He is also the chairman of the [[Sepang Circuit]], which hosts the [[Formula 1 World Championship]] in Malaysia.

==Personal life==
Mokhzani was born on 2 January 1961, in [[Alor Setar]], to [[Mahathir Mohamad]], then a practicing doctor, and [[Siti Hasmah]].

Mokhzani is currently married to Mastisa Mohamed, a businesswoman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.asiatatler.com/300list/mastisa-mohamed Puan Sri Mastisa Mohamed]&lt;/ref&gt; Together they have five children, and currently reside in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/mokhzani-mahathir/# Mokhzani Mahathir on Forbes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal fortune==
Mokhzani has been listed as the 14th richest person in Malaysia by ''[[Forbes Asia]]'' with an estimated net worth of US$685 million in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Forbes.com|title=The 40 Richest Malaysians|accessdate=8 August 2012|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2012/84/malaysia-billionaires-12_land.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Mokhzani is also the chairman of the [[Sepang International Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-143029059.html Mokhzani tastes victory]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Murray Hayden Haszard''' (born 11 May 1954) is a [[New Zealand]] entrepreneur and businessman who founded the companies [[B32 Software]] and [[Binary Research]] and is the chairman of [[Ilion Technology]].

Haszard married Kris MacPherson, and they had two children. The marriage ended in the mid-1990s.

==B32 Software==
In 1983 he was contracted to convert [[Kiwi Packaging]]'s corrugator scheduling package [[Kiwiplan]] from [[Data General Business Basic]] to [[Fortran|Fortran 77]] on a [[Data General]] MV computer. He found that Fortran had fast number-crunching but slow disk access, difficult debugging and inability to share files without using system calls, and Business Basic had slow arithmetic and limited memory space, but easy debugging and convenient handling of file sharing. After leaving [[Kiwi Packaging]] he attempted to create a language which shared the virtues of both.

[[B32 Business Basic]] took three years to write, but it was technically superior to Data General's Business Basic. Haszard expected that the world would beat a path to his door, but potential customers were conservative about using a new product, and doubtful that it could be supported from New Zealand. With the help particularly of [[George Henne]] and Maxon, a Toronto-based software reseller, B32 established a customer base and developed a reputation for performance in the Data General world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9202005_ITM DG Review interview, 1 November 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

Selling and supporting B32 required frequent exhausting trips to North America and Europe. Haszard expanded his company with an extra support programmer, but B32 continued to grow and was ported to the [[Unix]] operating system. A sales and support branch of B32 Software opened in [[Blue Ash, Ohio]] in 1990, but the demands of running a business only increased. Haszard wasn't having fun any more, and when his chief competition, [[Transoft]] offered to buy him out, he accepted. B32 sold for US$800,000 in February 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9253562_ITM BBASIC takeover. (Business BASIC)(Transoft acquires B32Software Ltd. and US subsidiary B32Software Inc.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Binary Research==
Haszard's next venture was [[Binary Research]], a company composed initially of former B32 employees. Binary Research's first product, a parallel file transfer utility, failed to reach break-even in the market, but led to the concept of a [[disk cloning]] program, [[Ghost (software)|Ghost]].

Ghost was a huge success, coming just as [[Windows 95]] created a demand for disk cloning. The huge growth of the [[Internet]] made software marketing and support around the world much simpler than before. A sales and support office in North America was set up, and a network of agents established around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/life-beyond-ghost |title=Life Beyond Ghost |date=3 July 2006 | publisher=National Business Review |first=Stephen |last=Ballantyne }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haszard brought in a business partner, Gray Treadwell, to help manage the business, and increased his programming staff manyfold. The stress of managing an international business became intolerable for Haszard, and he looked for a buyer for Ghost. [[Symantec]] purchased Ghost for US$27.5 million in July 1998. Most of the employees of Binary Research became employees of Symantec.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symantec.com/region/can/eng/press/1998/n980708.html Symantec Acquires Ghost, Expanding Corporate Solutions Set]&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Ghost==
Haszard set up [[Skunkworks Software]] with his remaining employees, producing a program called "Focus" which he describes as "PowerPoint on steroids".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liquidmedia.net/h-company.htm Liquid Media Company Background]&lt;/ref&gt; He also diversified from software into innovative aircraft propeller design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.propellor.com/wad56b.html Airmaster people]&lt;/ref&gt; He was quoted in ''Unlimited'' magazine's November 2000 issue as saying "I miss the adrenaline rush I had with Ghost and B32. There was a real fight for survival. I miss that."

Haszard invested in the New Zealand technology company Ilion Technology, which sold highly purified [[lithium]] metal to [[battery (electricity)|battery]] manufacturers and was also developing its own advanced battery designs. Ilion Technology planned to list itself on the [[NASDAQ]] stockmarket in 2000, but was unable to do so due to the fall of the markets. Ilion was left with much higher expenditure than income, and no cash reserves. Haszard and other investors kept the company afloat while it was reorganised, and he stepped in when the previous chairman lost the confidence of shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharechat.co.nz/features/unlimited/article.php/48063089 Unlimited Magazine: Time out]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite further efforts to fund the company,&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=3515079 3M throws lifeline to Ilion Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; Ilion Technology ceased operations in 2007 &lt;ref&gt;[https://opencorporates.com/companies/nz/1129542 Ceasing To Carry On Business Notice O/S]&lt;/ref&gt;

Haszard is the founder and chairman of Sprite Software, which makes software for backing up mobile devices and smart phones.  Some of the other developers from Binary Research also work there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spritesoftware.com/company Sprite Software Corporate History] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910135559/http://www.spritesoftware.com/company |date=2012-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/8F6A7AE9237EA2FCCC25720600148865 Haszard charts smart new course involving backup for ‘personalised’ mobile devices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717134851/http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/8F6A7AE9237EA2FCCC25720600148865 |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, GE Lighting is a part of [[GE Home &amp; Business Solutions]], headquartered in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]].  Nela Park serves as the operating headquarters of GE Lighting.

The institute was first organized by entrepreneurs Franklin Terry and Burton Tremaine of the National Electric Lamp Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=NP1 |title=Nela Park |work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |date=June 27, 1997 |accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of the site was started in 1911, when the [[National Electric Lamp Association]] (NELA), formed by John Robert Crouse, Sr, J.B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21271">'''New Public Management''' (NPM) is an approach to running [[public service]] organizations that is used in government and public service institutions and agencies, at both sub-national and national levels. The term was first introduced by academics in the UK and Australia &lt;ref&gt;Hood 1991 and Hood and Jackson 1991&lt;/ref&gt; to describe approaches that were developed during the 1980s as part of an effort to make the public service more "businesslike" and to improve its efficiency by using private sector management models. As with the private sector, which focuses on "[[customer service]]", NPM reforms often focused on the "...centrality of citizens who were the recipient of the services or customers to the public sector." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPM reformers experimented with using decentralized service delivery models, to give local agencies more freedom in how they delivered programs or services. In some cases, NPM reforms that used [[e-government]] consolidated a program or service to a central location to reduce costs. Some governments tried using [[quasi-market]] structures, so that the public sector would have to compete against the private sector (notably in the UK, in [[health care]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key themes in NPM were "...financial control, value for money, increasing efficiency...,identifying and setting targets and continuance monitoring of performance, handing over.. power to the senior management" [[Senior management|executives]]. Performance was assessed with audits, benchmarks and performance evaluations. Some NPM reforms used private sector companies to deliver what were formerly public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NPM advocates in some countries worked to remove "...collective agreements [in favour of]...individual rewards packages at senior levels combined with short term contracts" and introduce private sector-style [[corporate governance]], including using a [[Board of Directors]] approach to strategic guidance for public organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; While NPM approaches have been used in many countries around the world, NPM is particularly associated with the most industrialized [[OECD]] nations such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States of America]]. NPM advocates focus on using approaches from the private sector–the [[corporation|corporate]] or business world–which can be successfully applied in the public sector and in a [[public administration]] context. NPM approaches have been used to reform the public sector, its policies and its programs. NPM advocates claim that it is a more efficient and effective means of attaining the same outcome. 

In NPM, citizens are viewed as "customers" and public servants are viewed as public managers. NPM tries to realign the relationship between public service managers and their political superiors by making a parallel relationship between the two. Under NPM, public managers have incentive-based motivation such as pay-for-performance, and clear performance targets are often set, which are assessed by using [[performance evaluation]]s. As well, managers in an NPM paradigm may have greater discretion and freedom as to how they go about achieving the goals set for them. This NPM approach is contrasted with the traditional [[public administration]] model, in which institutional decision-making, policy-making and public service delivery is guided by regulations, legislation and [[administrative law|administrative procedures]]. 

NPM reforms use approaches such as disaggregation, customer satisfaction initiatives, [[customer service]] efforts, applying an [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial spirit]] to public service, and [[innovation|introducing innovations]]. The NPM system allows "the expert manager to have a greater discretion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance, and Public Administration|date=Feb 2, 2006|pages=888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Public Managers under the New Public Management reforms can provide a range of choices from which customers can choose, including the right to opt out of the service delivery system completely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first practices of New Public Management emerged in the United Kingdom under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Thatcher played the functional role of “policy entrepreneur" and the official role of prime minister.{{fact|date=November 2016}} Thatcher drove changes in public management policy in such areas as organizational methods, civil service, labor relations, expenditure planning, financial management, audit, evaluation, and procurement. Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]], kept public management policy on the agenda of the Conservative government, leading to the implementation of the Next Steps Initiative. Major also launched the programs of the Citizens Charter Initiative, Competing for Quality, Resource Accounting and Budgeting, and the Private Finance Initiative.

A term was coined in the late 1980s to denote a new (or renewed) focus on the importance of management and ‘production engineering’ in public service delivery, which often linked to doctrines of economic rationalism (Hood 1989, Pollitt 1993). During this timeframe public management became an active area of policy-making in numerous other countries, notably in New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden.  At the same time, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ]] (OECD) established its Public Management Committee and Secretariat (PUMA), conferring to public management the status normally accorded more conventional domains of policy. In the 1990s, public management was a major item on President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]’s agenda. Early policy actions of the Clinton administration included launching the [[National Partnership for Reinventing Government|National Partnership]] and signing into law the [[Government Performance and Results Act]]. Currently there are few indications that public management issues will vanish from governmental policy agendas. A recent study showed that in Italy, municipal directors are aware of a public administration now being oriented toward new public management where they are assessed according to the results they produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marozzi|first1=Marco|last2=Bolzan|first2=Mario|title=Skills and training requirements of municipal directors: A statistical assessment|journal=Quality and Quantity|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1093–1115|date=2015|doi=10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term New Public Management (NPM) expresses the idea that the cumulative flow of policy decisions over the past twenty years has amounted to a substantial shift in the governance and management of the “state sector” in the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[North America]]. A benign interpretation is that these decisions have been a defensible, if imperfect, response to policy problems. Those problems as well as their solutions were formulated within the policy-making process. The agenda-setting process has been heavily influenced by electoral commitments to improve macro- economic performance and to contain growth in the public sector, as well as by a growing perception of public bureaucracies as being inefficient. The alternative-generation process has been heavily influenced by ideas coming from economics and from various quarters within the field of management.

== Globalization ==
Although the origins of NPM came from Westernized countries it expanded to a variety of other countries in the 1990s. Before the 1990s, NPM was largely associated to an idea utilized by developed countries that are particularly Anglo-Saxon. However the 1990s have seen countries in Africa, Asia and other countries looking into using this method. In Africa, downsizing and decrease of user fees have been widely introduced. These autonomous agencies within the public sectors have been established in these areas. Performance contracting became a common policy in crisis states worldwide. Contracting out of this magnitude can be used to do things such as waste management, cleaning, laundry, catering and road maintenance.

== Aspects  ==

NPM was accepted as the "gold standard for administrative reform"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management: Theory, Ideology, and Practice|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance and Public Administration|date=Jan 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s. The idea for using this method for government reform was that if the government guided private-sector principles were used rather than rigid hierarchical bureaucracy, it would work more efficiently. NPM promotes a shift from bureaucratic administration to business-like professional management. NPM was cited as the solution for management ills in various organizational context and policy making in education and health care reform.

The basic principles of NPM is can best be described when split into seven different aspects elaborated by Christopher Hood in 1991. Hood also invented the term NPM itself. &lt;ref&gt;in "A Public Management for all seasons?", Public Administration Review, Voæl 69, Spring1991 (3-19).&lt;/ref&gt; They are the following:

=== Management ===
Because of its belief in the importance and strength of privatizing government, it is critical to have an emphasis on management by engaging in hands-on methods. This theory allows leaders the freedom to manage freely and open up discretion.

=== Performance standards ===
Its important to maintain explicit standards and measures of performance in a workforce. Using this method promotes clarification of goals/intent, targets, and indicators for progression.

=== Output controls ===
The third point acknowledges the "shift from the use of input controls and bureaucratic procedures to rules relying on output controls measured by quantitive performance indicators".&lt;ref&gt;Yamaoto, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect requires using performance based assessments when looking to outsource work to private companies/groups.

=== Decentralization ===
NPM advocates often shifted from a unified management system to a decentralized system in which managers gain flexibility and are not limited to agency restrictions.

=== Competition ===
This characteristic focuses on how NPM can promote competition in the public sector which could in turn lower cost, eliminate debate and possibly achieve a higher quality of progress/work through the term contacts. Competition can also be found when the government offers contracts to the private sectors and the contract is given in terms of the ability to deliver the service effectively, quality of the goods provided, hence this will increase competition because the other private sector which did not get the contract will make strides to improve the quality and ability thereby facilitating competition.

=== Private-sector management ===
This aspect focuses on the necessity to establish short-term labor contracts, develop corporate plans or [[business plan]]s, performance agreements and [[mission statement]]s. It also focuses on establishing a workplace in which public employees or contractors are aware of the goals and intention that agencies are trying to reach.

=== Cost reduction ===
The most effective one which has led to its ascent into global popularity, focuses on keeping cost low and efficiency high. "Doing more with less" &lt;ref&gt;Hood, 1991: 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;
moreover cost reduction stimulates efficiency and is one way which makes it different from the traditional approach of management&lt;ref&gt;Deffy, 1999:67-78&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between public and private sectors ==
New Public Management draws practices from the private sector and uses them in the public sector of management. NPM reforms use market forces to hold the public sector accountable and the satisfaction of preferences as the measures of accountability.  In order for this system to proceed, certain conditions, such as the existence of competition, must exist and information about choices must be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reforms that promise to reinvent government by way of focusing on results and customer satisfaction as opposed to administrative and political processes fail to account for legislative self-interest. Institutions other than federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinvention would not even be announced, except perhaps on hallway bulletin boards.

== Issues ==

===Criticisms===
There are blurred lines between policymaking and providing services in the New Public Management system. Questions have been raised about the potential politicization of the public service, when executives are hired on contract under pay-for-performance systems.  There are concerns that public managers may move away from trying to meet citizens' needs. NPM brings to question integrity and compliance when dealing with incentives for public managers. Questions such as managers being more or less faithful arise. The public interest is at risk and could undermine the trust in government. Accountability can be a big issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relevance  ====

Although NPM had a dramatic impact in the 1990s on managing and policymaking, many scholars believe that NPM has hit its prime. Scholars like Frank Dunleavy believe New Public Management is phasing out because of disconnect with “customers” and their institutions. Scholars cite the Digital Era and the new importance of technology that kills the necessity of NPM. In countries that are less industrialized the NPM concept is still growing and spreading. This trend has much to do with a country's ability or inability to get their public sector in tune with the Digital Era. New Public Management was created in the Public Sector to create change based on: disaggregation, competition, and incentives. Using incentives to produce the maximum services from an organization is largely stalled in many countries and being reversed because of increased complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives===
Post-NPM, many countries explored [[digital era governance]] (DEG). Dunleavy believes this new way of governance should be heavily centered upon information and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology will help re-integrate with digitalization changes. Digital Era Governance provides a unique opportunity for self- sustainability however, there are various factors that will determine whether or not DEG can be implemented successfully. When countries have proper technology, NPM simply can't compete very well with DEG. DEG does an excellent job of making services more accurate, prompt and remove most barriers and conflicts. DEG also can improve the service quality and provide local access to outsourcers.

===Comparisons to New Public Administration===

New Public Management is often mistakingly compared to [[New Public Administration]]. The ‘New Public Administration’ movement was one established in the USA during the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pfiffner|first1=James|title=Public Administration versus The New Public Management|url=http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Book_Chapters/NewPublicMgt.doc.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there may be some common features, the central themes of the two movements are different. The main thrust of the New Public Administration movement was to bring academic public administration into line with a radical egalitarian agenda that was influential in US university campuses. By contrast, the emphasis of the New Public Management movement a decade or so later was firmly managerial in the sense that it stressed the difference that management could and should make the quality and efficiency of public services. It focuses on public service production functions and operational issues contrasted with the focus on public accountability, ‘model employer’ public service values, ‘due process,’ and what happens inside public organizations in conventional public administration. That meant New Public Management doctrines tended to be opposed to egalitarian ideas of managing without managers, juridical doctrines of rigidly rule-bound administration and doctrines of self-government by public-service professionals like teachers and doctors.

'''Nobu Su''' ({{zh|t=蘇信吉}}) is the CEO and owner of the Taipei-based [[shipping company]] [[TMT (Today Makes Tomorrow)|Today Makes Tomorrow]] (TMT), (formerly Taiwan Maritime Transportation).

==Education==
He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science in Economics|BSC in economics]] from [[Keio University]] in Tokyo, Japan&lt;ref name="Star Bulk Carriers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Bulk Carriers|url=http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Star_Bulk_Carriers_(SBLK)/Nobu|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned an MBA from the [[International Institute for Management Development]] (IMD) in 1982.&lt;ref name="imd.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobu Su Establishes Professorship at IMD|url=http://www.imd.org/news/Nobu-Su-Professorship.cfm|website=www.imd.org|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurship ==

[https://nobusunet.wpengine.com/ Nobu Su] recently introduced Ocean net, a system which may enable the transmission and reception of data via an offshore mobile communications network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nobusunet.wpengine.com/oceannet/|title=OceanNet - Nobu Su|work=Nobu Su|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ocean net was originally devised as a cost-effective ship-to-shore communications network allowing shipping crews to contact their families, but also used in ship-to-ship transmissions for safety.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 2002, Su registered&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mr-nobu-su-successfully-registers-013800638.html|title = Mr. Nobu Su Successfully Registers Patent for Innovative Marine Mobile Network System|date = 29 December 2014|accessdate = |website = Yahoo Finance|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first of three successful patents for Ocean net. Patents have been registered in the United Kingdom (2002), the United States (2004) and Korea (2009).

Advances in cloud computing have increased the effectiveness of Ocean net over the [[Automatic Identification System|AIS system]] currently used by the shipping industry.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Su has also designed an underdeck piping structure for ships, which he patented in Japan, [[Korea]] and China, which he has allowed shipping companies to use without license.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraphindia.com/pressrelease/prnw/1190416_en90416_0.html&lt;/ref&gt; Su’s underdeck piping system for ships is currently in commercial use.

Su has a registered patent&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.crunchbase.com/person/nobu-su|title = Nobu Su on Crunchbase|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a technology called Time Stamp which seeks to eliminate email fraud with a unique time signature for users.

TMT has interests in Forward Freight Agreements (FFA's) on the global market.

On 19 April 2011, Su was given the Lifetime Achievement for Entrepreneurship award at the international ShipTek conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tradeshield.ae/media-centre/trade-logistics-news/453-shiptek-highlights-maritime-industrys-growth|title = ShipTek highlights maritime industry's growth|date = 27 April 2011|accessdate = |website = Dubai Trade|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160829075607/http://tradeshield.ae/media-centre/trade-logistics-news/453-shiptek-highlights-maritime-industrys-growth|archivedate = 29 August 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shipping business ==

&lt;ref&gt;As Chairman of TMT [http://nobusu.net Nobu Su]&lt;/ref&gt; has increased the ownership of vessels across multiple shipping classes. The company once operated over 20 carriers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; including LNG carriers, VLCC carriers, cement carriers and vehicle freight Ro-Ro- carriers. Presently the size of the fleet is unknown as suspected to be zero.

Su has also turned TMT, his company, into a failed operator of real tankers and [[Dry bulk cargo barge|dry bulk]] ships. Under his direction TMT has expanded its fleet to include drybulk carriers, very large crude carriers, cargo carriers, liquefied natural gas carriers, automobile carriers, and cement carriers&lt;ref name="Star Bulk Carriers"/&gt; In addition to increasing the service capabilities of TMT, with clients such as [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sinoshipnews.com/News/Good-week-for-Nobu-Su-/3w3c1838.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207074626/http://www.sinoshipnews.com/News/Good-week-for-Nobu-Su-/3w3c1838.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobu Su had transformed TMT into a global leader in the international shipping industry. Under his direction, TMT was one of the most successful participants in the global freight derivatives market (FFA market).&lt;ref name="Star Bulk Carriers"/&gt; Su has been described as "Mr Controversy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Robert|title=Taiwan's Mr Controversy runs a tight and very private ship at TMT|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0a4113be-329a-11dd-9b87-0000779fd2ac.html?siteedition=intl#axzz3NIGMVgXf|website=The Financial Times|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the FFA market.

The most recent vessel purchases have been in Capesize dry-bulk carriers as well investments into oil tankers. TMT has a number of business partners and charters from companies like Chevron&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/US-Court-Orders-Release-of-Arrested-TMT-Ship-2013-09-20|title = U.S. Court Orders Release of Arrested TMT Ship|date = 20 September 2013|accessdate = |website = The Maritime Executive|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and COA, for crude oil transport and cement transport. In February 2017 it was revealed that in 2013 he ran afoul of US trade sanctions against Iran.&lt;ref&gt;http://splash247.com/nobu-su-hot-water-us-violating-iran-sanctions/&lt;/ref&gt; He has gained attention for his conspiracy theories against the global banking system, including specific attacks on RBS and JPMorgan, and for his belief in conspiracy theories that the Sept. 11th terror attacks in the US were engineered by the politicians and bankers to destroy evidence of wrongdoing.

== Legal issues ==

In June 2013 Su filed for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after being put under pressure by Taiwanese creditors, then in 2015 appealed a $47m judgement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nobusunet.wpengine.com/feature-film-the-outsider/|title=Feature film: The Outsider - Nobu Su|work=Nobu Su|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; against him in a long-standing case against Lakatamia.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Corporate News, [http://www.nasdaq.com/article/headway-for-nobu-su-20150414-00262 “Headway for Nobu Su”] "Nasdaq" 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pan-Asian activism ==

Nobu Su is based in Taiwan and sees the country as an important part of the global shipping industry. He seeks to increase the holdings, visibility and reach of Asian companies within the shipping markets. Through TMT, he has invested in a number of regional shipping companies and ship construction companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.maritime-ceo.com/News/TMT:-Nobu-Su-admits--%E2%80%98I-would-have-played-it-differently%E2%80%99-/3w3c426.html|title =TMT: Nobu Su admits, ‘I would have played it differently’|date =|accessdate =|website =The Mritime CEO|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140827214931/http://www.maritime-ceo.com/News/TMT:-Nobu-Su-admits--%E2%80%98I-would-have-played-it-differently%E2%80%99-/3w3c426.html|archivedate =27 August 2014|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Su sees his corporate activities as a way of promoting Asian corporate leadership, participation and integration into the global economy&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tmtship.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  and has worked to further research on how Asian companies and leaders can utilize creative methods to be more integrated in the global economy.&lt;ref name="imd.org"/&gt;

Su has stated that he plans to expand the reach of Asian companies into other investments and markets, with a plan to invest&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000091597#.|title = Taiwan's TMT's Natural Gas Plans|date = 21 May 2012|accessdate = |website = CNBC|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a liquefaction company in São Tomé and Principe to produce natural gas.

== Philanthropy ==

Su has endowed a chair at IMD that focuses on researching "how Asian companies and leaders can utilize creative methods to be more integrated in the global economy". The chair is titled the Nobu Su Professor of Global Leadership, with Professor Katherine Xin as the first holder of the chair.&lt;ref name="imd.org"/&gt;

Casiraghi is eighth in the [[line of succession to the Monegasque throne]], following his twin cousins, his mother, brother [[Andrea Casiraghi|Andrea]], nephews [[Alexandre Casiraghi|Alexandre]] and Maximillian Casiraghi, and his niece [[India Casiraghi]].

== Early life and education ==

Casiraghi was born in 5 September 1987 at [[Princess Grace Hospital Centre]], in [[La Colle, Monaco|La Colle]], [[Monaco]]. He is named after his maternal great-grandfather, [[Prince Pierre, Duke of Valentinois]], his maternal grandfather, [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier III]], and his father. His godparents are his uncle, [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert II]], and his aunt by marriage Laura Sabatini Casiraghi, the wife of his uncle Daniele.&lt;ref name="michaelsebook" /&gt; Casiraghi was three years old at the time of his father's death in a boating accident. He spent his earliest years, after his father's death, living at his mother's farmhouse in the quaint town of [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]].&lt;ref name="michaelsebook" /&gt;

He attended a state school in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]].&lt;ref name="michaelsebook" /&gt; However, after his mother's remarriage to [[Prince Ernst August of Hanover (born 1954)|Ernst August, Prince of Hanover]], the family moved to [[Fontainebleau]], to be nearer to [[Paris]] and [[London]], the latter being where his new stepbrothers lived with their mother.&lt;ref name="michaelsebook" /&gt; It is assumed that Casiraghi passed the [[French Baccalaureate]] exam in the summer of 2005 since he shortly afterwards began [[university]]. One year later, in fact, he moved to [[Milan]] to begin a three-year undergraduate course in International Economics and Management at [[Bocconi University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2006/settembre/24/figlio_Carolina_Bocconi_come_papa_co_9_060924063.shtml |title=Archivio Corriere della Sera |website=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2016-02-29 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[French language|French]], he is fluent in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], and knows some [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="us.hellomagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://us.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2014090520820/pierre-casiraghi-10-facts-birthday/ |title=Pierre Casiraghi: 10 facts about Princess Caroline's son |website=Us.hellomagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also plays the [[saxophone]].&lt;ref name="us.hellomagazine.com"/&gt;

==Humanitarian and business activities==
From 30 January to 13 February 2007, Casiraghi accompanied his mother on a [[humanitarian]] tour of Africa.&lt;ref name="amade"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070519035117/http://www.monaco-consulate.com/Princess_of_Hanover/africa.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt; They visited [[Niger]], [[Burundi]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], and [[South Africa]] on behalf of Princess Caroline's role as President of [[AMADE Mondiale]].&lt;ref name="amade"/&gt;

In June 2009, Casiraghi became the majority shareholder of the Monaco-based construction company Engeco, which his father founded in 1984. His uncle Marco remains in the position of President over Engeco. The acquisition of the majority shares to Casiraghi's name was handled by the [[Milan]]-based legal firm [[Bird &amp; Bird]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twobirds.com/Italian/NEWS/PRESSRELEASES/Pagine/Lo_Studio_Legale_Bird_Bird_Italia_assiste_Pierre_Casiraghi_nell_acquisizione_della_quota_maggioritaria_di_ENGECO_SAM.Aspx |title=News Centre |website=Twobirds.com |date=2013-01-21 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casiraghi is also the majority shareholder of [[Monacair]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.podcastjournal.net/NOMINATION-DE-PIERRE-CASIRAGHI-COMME-MEMBRE-D-HONNEUR-DE-LA-JEUNE-CHAMBRE-ECONOMIQUE_a7955.html |title=Nomination De Pierre Casiraghi Comme 'Membre D'Honneur' De La Jeune Chambre Economique |website=Podcastjournal.net |date=2011-04-16 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="montecarlonews.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montecarlonews.it/notizie/argomenti/altre-notizie-1/articolo/pierre-casiraghi-membro-onorario-della-jeune-chambre-economique.html |title=Pierre Casiraghi membro onorario della Jeune Chambre Economique - MontecarloNews: notizie su Montecarlo, Monaco, Mentone, Nizza, Antibes, Costa Azzurra |website=Montecarlonews.it |date=2011-04-16 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team Malizia takes its name from ''Il Malizia'', which means the Cunning, and which was the nickname assigned to Casiraghi's medieval ancestor [[François Grimaldi]].&lt;ref name="michaelsebook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knightley|first1=Emma|title=Princely Monaco XXI: The House of Grimaldi in the 21st Century|date=29 November 2017|ISBN=9780359058945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Bland Lee the third son of [[Henry Lee II]] and Lucy Grymes was born on January 20, 1761 at [[Leesylvania State Park|"Leesylvania"]], the estate built by his father on land overlooking the Potomac River in [[Prince William County, Virginia]]. He was named after two distinguished relatives, his great-grandfather [[Richard Bland (burgess)|Richard Bland]] of "Jordan's Point", and his great-uncle, jurist and statesman [[Richard Bland]], whom Thomas Jefferson called "the wisest man south of the James".&lt;ref name="Gamble"&gt;Gamble, Robert S. '' Sully: Biography of a House'' (Sully Foundation Ltd: Chantilly, VA, 1973), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly educated as a youth at "Chantilly", the home of his venerated cousin [[Richard Henry Lee]] in [[Westmoreland County, Virginia]], Richard was enrolled at the [[The College of William &amp; Mary|College of William and Mary]] in 1779. Though not directly involved in the Revolutionary war as his brother [[Henry Lee III]] was, Richard nevertheless took an active interest in the American cause. In June 1779 for example, Richard's uncle [[Richard "Squire" Lee|"Squire" Richard Lee]] of Lee Hall introduced a resolution in the House of Delegates that would authorize the building of a new statehouse. Though only eighteen years of age, Richard Bland Lee, in a letter written later that month, rebuked his famous uncle, characterizing the effort as "abominable...[at a]...time of public danger when our expenses are already unsupportable."&lt;ref name="Gamble"/&gt; On June 17 of the next year Richard was admitted to the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]], an academic organization through which he was able to refine his speaking skills.&lt;ref name="Records of Phi Beta Kappa"&gt;Original Records of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, ''William and Mary College Quarterly Magazine'', Richmond, Vol. IV, April 1896&lt;/ref&gt; In December of that year, a British invasion fleet transporting newly minted British General [[Benedict Arnold]] and his troops appeared off Jamestown, prepared it seemed, to launch an advance upon Richmond.&lt;ref name="Records of Phi Beta Kappa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Randall, WIlalrd Sterne"&gt;Randall, Willard Sterne. ''Benedict Arnold: Patriot and Traitor'', (New York, William &amp; Morrow Co., 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Phi Beta Kappa undertook to secure its papers against capture, and many of its members joined a hastily formed local militia company to offer at least some resistance to the expected invasion.&lt;ref name="Gamble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Records of Phi Beta Kappa"/&gt;

Richard Bland Lee may have been a part of this militia, or may have earlier returned to "Leesylvania" to "converse with his father about the future."&lt;ref name="Gamble"/&gt; Part of that future had apparently already been decided for him, as his father Henry Lee II had destined a part of his holdings on [[Cub Run]] to Richard, who it appears agreed to act on his father's behalf in managing this property sometime in 1780 or 1781. In 1787, he inherited {{convert|1500|acre|km2}} of this holding from his father, land that would comprise the estate he would later name "[[Sully (Fairfax County, Virginia)|Sully]]".

==Public life==
===Virginia House of Delegates===
Richard served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1784 to 1788, 1796, and again from 1799 to 1806. During his second term in the state legislature he was involved in debates surrounding the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] which he wholeheartedly supported. Following ratification he opposed efforts by [[Patrick Henry]] and others to call a second constitutional convention to add a bill of rights, believing the new system should be given a chance to operate before wholesale alterations were made. He also believed that the new congress could be trusted to add the necessary amendments.

[[Image:Virginia Capitol 1865.jpg|thumb|left|Virginia State Capitol built in 1785, as it appeared in 1865]]

It was also during this term that the election of Virginia's first two United States Senators took place. Lee was a strong supporter of [[James Madison]]'s candidacy. Ultimately however, Madison was rejected by the [[Patrick Henry|Henry]] led House of Delegates on the assumption that he would not push for addition of a bill of rights. A contention Lee worked hard to counteract.  Following this rejection Lee continued to work on Madison's behalf in his congressional race, proposing publication of letters between Madison and other's ''"...as would counteract the report industriously circulated in the assembly and consequently in the state that you were opposed to every amendment to the new government, and in every mode..."''&lt;ref name="Lee to Madison, Nov. 1788"&gt;Richard Bland Lee to James Madison, 17 Nov. 1788(Library of Congress, Richard Bland lee Collection)&lt;/ref&gt; Unwilling to risk publication of letters critical of others, Madison rejected this idea, but would nevertheless defeat future President [[James Monroe]] in a hard fought contest.

In both of these debates Lee recognized the power of Patrick Henry's oratory, lamenting the weakness of opposition to him. In a letter from Lee to Madison he complains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our Assembly is &lt;u&gt;weak&lt;/u&gt;. Mr. [Patrick] Henry is the only orator we have against us and the friends to the new government being all young and inexperienced, form a feeble bond against him.&lt;ref name="Lee to Madison, Oct. 1788"&gt;Richard Bland Lee to James Madison, 29 Oct. 1788 (Library of Congress, Richard Bland lee Collection)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Henry was ultimately able to get the Virginia legislature to pass the measure urging Congress to call a new constitutional convention, Congress refused to do so, instead passing the first ten amendments to the constitution that make up the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

===US Congress===

Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1979.--February 1789&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1788, having served three years in the Virginia House of Delegates, Richard Bland Lee decided to stand for election to the [[1st United States Congress|new federal congress]] established under the recently ratified [[United States Constitution|constitution]]. Though political parties had yet to form,  ideological schisms were already developing by time of the first federal election. In general, those who were the strongest supporters of the constitution in the form adopted by the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|constitutional convention]], including its provision for a strong executive with power tilted toward the federal government were identified as federalists, and those who were less supportive of a strong federal government, and who believed a bill of rights should have been included with the document prior to ratification, anti-federalists. Lee was identified with the former camp. He had strongly supported ratification of the constitution,&lt;ref name="Bickford"&gt;Bickford, Charlene B. et al. ''The Documentary History of the First Federal Congress, March 4, 1789-March 3, 1791'' (Johns Hopkins University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; opposed efforts to force a second constitutional convention for the purpose of adding a bill of rights, and was a strong supporter of [[George Washington]]. His district which included his estate Sully, then part of Loudoun County (now Fairfax County), and included [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], was the home of both Washington as well as future Anti-Federalist leader, [[George Mason]].

Lee eventually became the consensus candidate of the federalists, overcoming competition from like minded men including relative Ludwell Lee, [[William Fitzhugh]], Martin Pickett, as well as two friends - [[Leven Powell]] and [[David Stuart (Virginia)|Dr. David Stuart]].&lt;ref name="Bickford"/&gt; Opposing him for the anti-federalists was state Senator John Pope. Though there is little primary material describing the tenor of this first election, what does exist hints at a hard fought and sometimes dirty campaign. John Pope was called "contemptible" in a letter from John Murray to [[Horatio Gates]],&lt;ref name="Gates"&gt;Letter from John Murray to Horatio Gates, January 9, 1789. ''Horatio Gates Papers''&lt;/ref&gt; and William Allason writing to John Woodcock described the contest: ''"I understand one makes very free with the other's Reputation &amp;c by wch. I would not be surprised to hear of their having Exchanged a few dry blows."''&lt;ref name="Allason"&gt;Letter from William Allason to John Woodcock. Published in "Important Letters from the Papers of William Allason, Merchant, of Falmouth, VA".,''Richmond College Historical Papers'', II (1917-1918), 174.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee eventually outpolled Pope, defeating him nearly 4 to 1 in Fairfax County alone, which included the vote of George Washington.&lt;ref name="Allason"/&gt;

On March 3, 1789 Richard Bland Lee began service as the first representative of Northern Virginia in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. He served three terms as a Pro-Administration (federalist) member of congress from 1789 to 1795. He was a party to the [[Compromise of 1790]] by which in exchange for support of southern delegates for federal assumption of state Revolutionary War debt, northern delegates voted to move the Federal City to a location in the south. His participation in this compromise, as well as his adherence to federalist principles proved to be his downfall. He narrowly fended off a challenge from his more famous relative [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]] in 1792, and finally lost his seat to [[Richard Brent (Virginia)|Richard Brent]] in the election of 1794. Following this defeat, Richard was returned to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1795, and again from 1799 to 1806.

====Other government service====
[[Image:US Capitol 1814c.jpg|left|thumb|210px|'''The United States Capitol after the burning of Washington, D.C. in the War of 1812. Watercolor and ink depiction from 1814, restored.''']]

Following his removal from "[[Sully (Fairfax County, Virginia)|Sully]]" to Washington, DC in 1815, Richard, along with [[John Peter Van Ness]] and [[Tench Ringgold]], was appointed by longtime friend President [[James Madison]] as one of three Commissioners to superintend the reconstruction of the Federal [[Burning of Washington|buildings damaged by British troops]] in the attack on Washington DC on August 24, 1814 during the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;Allen, William C. '' History of the United States Capitol: A chronicle of design, construction, and politics'' (Government Printing Office: Washington, DC, 2001), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Following expiration of this commission in 1816 President Madison intended to nominate Lee to the new position of "Commissioner of Public Buildings".&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt; However, after learning the Senate would not confirm any of the three members of the previous commission because of their perceived ill treatment  of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Benjamin Latrobe]] who had been appointed [[Architect of the Capitol]] in order to aid in its reconstruction, Richard was instead appointed by President Madison as a commissioner to adjudicate claims arising out of the loss or destruction of property during the War of 1812. Lee occupied this position for two contentious years, during which his decisions came in for harsh criticism by Congress. [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] of Virginia accused Lee of "malfeasance," and congress finally appointed a "Committee of Claims" to look into the operation of Lee's office. While Lee himself was exonerated of any corruption, the committee noted that many "claimants had perpetrated an extensive 'system of fraud, forgery, and perhaps perjury." &lt;ref name = "Dauber"&gt;Michele Landis Dauber, The War of 1812, September 11th, and the Politics of Compensation, 53 DePaul
L. Rev. 289, 289-90 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; With his power severely curtailed, Lee, despondent over his treatment, left his position and for a short time seriously considered moving his family to Kentucky. Realizing his prospects would be limited there, and that his wife opposed the move, he decided to stay in Washington DC. In 1819 he was appointed by President Monroe as a judge of the [[Probate Court#The Orphan's Court|Orphans' Court]] of the District of Columbia, a position he held until his death on March 12, 1827.

===Societies===

During the 1820s, Lee was a member of the prestigious society, [[Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences]], who counted among their members former presidents [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[John Quincy Adams]] and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions.&lt;ref name="rathbun"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MY-5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA118 |title=The Columbian institute for the promotion of arts and sciences: A Washington Society of 1816–1838. |first=Richard |last=Rathbun |accessdate=2010-06-20|work=|publisher=Bulletin of the United States National Museum, October 18, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FallHouse.JPG|right|thumb|210px|'''Sully, Home of Richard Bland Lee''']]

Upon his death in 1787, [[Henry Lee II]] bequeathed {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} of his Cub Run estates to be equally divided between his sons Richard Bland and Theodorick. Being the older of the two, Richard was given the more alluvial northern half, on which he already resided, having lived there as manager of the estate since approximately 1781. After his election to Congress, and for most of the next five years, Richard turned day-to-day management of his estate over to his brother Theodorick, who supervised spring planting, fall harvest, collection of rent from tenant farmers, and the construction of the large house Richard had planned for the estate on which construction had begun in 1794. Before he left for Congress in 1789, Richard had chosen a name for his estate, Sully. The exact origin of the name is unknown, though Robert S. Gamble in ''Sully: Biography of a House'' speculates that Sully was named after [[Sully-sur-Loire|"Chateau de Sully"]] in the Valley of Loire in France. According to Gamble, "if he turned to a specific source, it was doubtless the ''Memoires'' of [[Maximilien de Béthune, duc de Sully|Maximilien de Bethune]], Duke of Sully and France's Minister of Finance under Henry IV."&lt;ref name="Gamble"/&gt; This work was well known among wealthy Virginians in the late 18th century.

Upon his defeat for reelection to Congress, Richard returned to "[[Sully (Fairfax County, Virginia)|Sully]]" and took over primary operation of his estate. Determined to steer clear of the untenable practices characteristic of the tobacco [[monoculture]] which predominated in Virginia, Richard, like [[George Washington]] whom he idolized, applied modern methods of farming designed to diversify production and to halt depletion of the soil. To the end he switched to growing staple crops - wheat, rye, barley, corn and timothy, fruit trees - apple to produce cider, and peach for the making of peach brandy. He planted clover to help replenish the soil and he "tried crop rotation and the application of nutrients, especially crushed limestone, to fields where productivity was decreasing."&lt;ref name="Gamble"/&gt; During this period he either abandoned or severely limited the growing of tobacco at "[[Sully (Fairfax County, Virginia)|Sully]]." He planted large vegetable gardens and in 1801 Richard built a dairy house constructed with red [[Seneca Quarry|Seneca stone]].

Construction on the large house was begun in 1794 and completed in 1795. It is a "[[Federal architecture|Federal]]"- or "[[Georgian Architecture|Georgian]]"-style home of two and a half stories. He erected a {{frac|1|1|2}}-story addition in 1799 coincident with the wedding of [[William Lee (diplomat)#Children|Portia Lee]] who, along with her sister [[William Lee (diplomat)#Children|Cornelia Lee]] had come to live with Richard and Elizabeth Lee under their guardianship.  Driven into significant debt trying to aid his brothers Maj. Gen. [[Henry Lee III|Henry ("Light Horse Harry") Lee]] and [[Charles Lee (Attorney General)|Charles Lee]] extricate themselves from severe financial difficulties, Richard sold "[[Sully (Fairfax County, Virginia)|Sully]]" in 1811 to a cousin, [[Richard Henry Lee#Francis Lightfoot Lee II|Francis Lightfoot Lee]] (1782–1858). Richard Bland and Elizabeth Lee initially moved to a home in Alexandria, then to a country home called [[Strawberry Vale Manor|Strawberry Vale]] near Scott's Run [http://gfhs.org/oral_hists/rambler_12-31-16.htm] (current site of [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]]), and finally to the historic [[Thomas Law House]] at Sixth and N Streets, Southwest in Washington, DC.

"Sully" is located at Chantilly, just off U.S. Route 50, on [[State Route 28 (Virginia)|State Route 28]], the southern access road to Dulles International Airport.  It is owned and operated as a museum house by the Fairfax County Park Authority.

==Marriage==

Richard married Elizabeth Collins (c. 1768–1858) in 1794, at her parent's home in Germantown, PA.  Elizabeth was the daughter of Philadelphia Quaker merchant Stephen Collins and [[Mary Parrish]], and the sister of [[Zaccheus Collins]], a prominent botanist. Her lifelong friend was [[Dolley Madison|Dolley Payne Todd Madison]].

==Death==

Richard died in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was buried in the [[Congressional Cemetery]] there in 1827. In 1975 he was reinterred at his home, the ''Sully Plantation'' near [[Chantilly, Virginia]]. His home is now open to visitors as a county park. [http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/parks/sully www.fairfaxcounty.gov/parks/sully]

The '''Rivers State Civil Service''' ('''RSCS''') is the body of professional [[civil servants]] entrusted with the responsibility of carrying out the policies of the [[Rivers State]] government in relation to infrastructural development and social service delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Synergy between the Private Sector and Government advocated|url=http://riversstate.gov.ng/component/content/article/91-news/press-release/520-synergy-between-the-private-sector-and-government-advocated.html|accessdate=3 July 2015|work=Government of Rivers State|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704035233/http://riversstate.gov.ng/component/content/article/91-news/press-release/520-synergy-between-the-private-sector-and-government-advocated.html|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The body is led by the Head of Service (HOS), a member of the [[Executive Council of Rivers State|executive council]], who is the most senior administrative official within the civil service of Rivers State. The civil servants are found mainly in the [[List of government ministries of Rivers State|ministries]] and [[List of government agencies of Rivers State|parastatals]], where they perform their duties, progressing based on qualifications and seniority. The ministries are managed by Permanent Secretaries who report to Commissioners in the executive council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New HOS assumes office in Rivers State|url=http://www.riversstate.gov.ng/item/731-new-hos-assumes-office-in-rivers-state.html|accessdate=3 July 2015|work=Government of Rivers State|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
RSCS has the following functions:

# to develop public policies;
# to implement government policies;
# to stimulate the public and private sectors of the economy;
# to monitor policy performance in the public and private sectors;
# to serve the various organs of the state government.

==Recruitment==
RSCS is constantly recruiting to find qualified candidates with the skills, educational qualifications and experience to enable it function effectively. The civil service also aims to provide opportunities for citizens to obtain employment. Free application forms are issued by the [[Rivers State Civil Service Commission]] to those who wish to become civil servants. Once filled and returned to the commission, the next step for the applicants is to wait to be interviewed. If found eligible, such persons are usually more likely to be employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anyalewechi|first1=Bekee|title=Rivers set for massive recruitment into Civil Service|url=http://theneighbourhoodonline.com/news/othernews/2777-rivers-set-for-massive-recruitment-into-civil-service.html|accessdate=3 July 2015|work=The Neighbourhood|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RSG Approves Employment Of 2,000 Into Civil Service|url=http://www.thetidenewsonline.com/2014/05/09/rsg-approves-employment-of-2000-into-civil-service/|accessdate=3 July 2015|work=[[The Tide (Nigeria)|The Tide]]|date=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil Service values==
Certain core values exist within the civil service which all civil servants are expected to share and uphold. These core values are [[integrity]], [[meritocracy]], discipline, professionalism, patriotism, impartiality and secrecy of government information, except where the information divulged conforms with the [[Freedom of information laws by country#Nigeria|Freedom of Information Act]] (FoI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amaechi Hails Rivers Civil Servants|url=http://www.thetidenewsonline.com/2014/07/16/amaechi-hails-rivers-civil-servants/|accessdate=3 June 2015|work=[[The Tide (Nigeria)|The Tide]]|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drury attended [[Napier Boys' High School]], where he developed an interest in computer programming.&lt;ref name="november2017" /&gt; He went on to study commerce and administration at [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. After university, he worked at the accounting firm Arthur Young, which became [[Ernst &amp; Young]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
In 1995, Drury established [[Glazier Systems]], a New Zealand software development and consulting company. Glazier Systems was acquired by Advantage Group&lt;ref name="Idealog profile"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.idealog.co.nz/magazine/7/repeat-offender/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207094619/http://www.idealog.co.nz/magazine/7/repeat-offender/ | archivedate=7 February 2013| title=Rod Drury: Repeat offender | work=idealog | date=13 December 2006 | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=Cooney, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 for approximately $7.5 million.&lt;ref name="Dom Post profile"/&gt; Drury subsequently founded and served as CEO of AfterMail which was acquired by [[Quest Software]] (subsequently acquired by [[Francisco Partners]] and [[Elliott Management Corporation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/20/confirmed-dell-sells-software-division-to-francisco-partners-and-elliott-management/|title=Confirmed: Dell sells software division to Francisco Partners and Elliott Management|last=Miller|first=Ron|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006 Drury founded [[Xero (software)|Xero]], a publicly listed [[software as a service]] accounting-software company, and served as its CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/better-business/9295899/Xero-founder-Rod-Drury-takes-entrepreneur-prize | title=Xero founder Rod Drury takes entrepreneur prize | publisher=Fairfax | work=Stuff.co.nz | date=17 October 2013 | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=Moore, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Drury was a judge for the [[New Zealand Open Source Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nzosa.org.nz/judges | title=New Zealand Open Source Awards |date=2007-10-17| accessdate=2008-05-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509130322/http://www.nzosa.org.nz/judges |archivedate = 2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drury co-founded Pacific Fibre, a company which attempted to build an internet cable between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/4521214/Pacific-Fibre-adds-Facebook-and-Paypal | title=Pacific Fibre adds Facebook and Paypal | work=Stuff.co.nz | date=8 January 2011 | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=McBeth, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cable would have cost around $400 million but the venture was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10824153 | title=Politics helped kill cable | publisher=NZME | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=3 August 2012 | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=Fletcher, Hamish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, he sold $95 million worth of shares in Xero, leaving him with a 13 per cent holding in the company. He stated the sale would support his "future plans to pursue a range of philanthropic and social endeavours." He stepped down as CEO of Xero in March 2018, continuing on with the company as a non-executive director.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/101976251/rod-drury-stands-down-as-ceo-of-xero Rod Drury stands down as CEO of Xero, replaced by Aussie]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5121">[[Image:YaleCarillonBells.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The bells of the Yale Memorial Carillon. Wires connect the clappers to the console below.]]

The '''Yale Memorial Carillon''' (sometimes incorrectly referred to as the ''Harkness Carillon'') is a [[carillon]] of 54 [[bell (instrument)|bells]] in [[Harkness Tower]] at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

This [[carillon]] is a transposing instrument pitched in B. Its 54 bells are chromatically arranged from G (1.5 octaves below middle-C) to C (3 octaves above middle-C) for a total of 4.5 octaves. The lowest bell is an F♯ concert pitch, and weighs 13,400 pounds.[http://www.yale.edu/carillon/aboutcarillon.htm] Each bell is engraved with the year it was cast, the seal of the foundry, the seal of Yale, and the motto "For God, For Country, and For Yale."

==Origin==

[[Harkness Tower]], the Memorial Quadrangle that surrounds it, and the Harkness Memorial Chime were all part of a gift to Yale made by [[Anna M. Harkness]] in memory of her son, [[Charles W. Harkness|Charles William Harkness]]. Its original 10 bells (an instrument with a range of less than two octaves is referred to as a [[Chime (bell instrument)|chime]] - the ''Harkness Memorial Chime'' - rather than a [[carillon]]) were cast by the [[John Taylor Bellfounders]] of [[Loughborough]], [[England]], in 1921. They were installed in [[Harkness Tower]] in 1922 and were first rung by John Taylor on June 9, 1922. The chimes were rung regularly by the university organist, Samuel H. Smith, until 1946 when this duty was assumed by a student, Elliot H. Kone '49. On his graduation in 1949, Kone formed a student organization, the ''Guild of Yale Bellringers,'' to continue with four rings per day.

==Expansion==

In 1966, the instrument was expanded by the installation of an additional 44 bells, made possible by a gift from Florence S. Marcy Crofut and also cast by the John Taylor Bellfounders. The original chime had 10 pitches, which were named in [[Concert pitch#Concert pitch|concert pitch]] (F♯-G-A-B-C-C♯-D-E-F♯-G); the expansion kept the same bell as [[Bourdon (bell)|bourdon]], but the notes were renamed to make the bourdon a G (it is common practice to make carillons transposing instruments so that composers can assume a standard range).  The new fully [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] 4.5 [[octave]] carillon was named the ''Yale Memorial Carillon'' to avoid showing preference to either the Harkness or the Crofut gift. At this point the Guild renamed itself the Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs.

Before the additional bells arrived, a practice carillon was installed in the tower to allow Guild members to learn the new instrument ahead of time.  The practice carillon has a keyboard and pedalboard identical to those of the carillon, but the keys strike small tone bars instead of full-sized bells.  The practice carillon allows Guild members to practice at a volume comparable to that of most other instruments instead of at the full volume of the carillon, which can be heard for several blocks.  A second practice carillon was installed in April, 2006, adding greater flexibility to practicing schedules.

Yale tour guides like to perpetuate the myth that [[Harkness Tower]] was once the tallest free-standing stone structure in the world, but needed to be reinforced because an eccentric architect poured acid down the walls to make the tower look older. However, the [[Washington Monument]] has been the tallest free-standing stone structure in the United States since it was completed, long before [[Harkness Tower]] was built. Furthermore, it was the weight of the additional bells in 1966 that necessitated the reinforcement of the tower with a steel frame structure to carry the additional weight.

== Current use ==

The instrument is currently rung by Guild members twice a day when classes are in session, and in the evening during the summer. From September to May, rings occur at 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. During the summer, the Guild hosts a concert series of guest carillonneurs on Friday evenings. Free tours are led by students throughout the year and can be arranged using the Guild's [http://yalecarillon.org/request-tour website].

[[Image:YaleCarillonConsole.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The carillon console. Guild members strike the batons with their hand and the pedals with their feet to move the clappers of the bells.]]

Every fall semester, all students from Yale College and the Yale Graduate Schools are invited to learn to play the carillon and can audition for a place in the [http://yalecarillon.org Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs]. These students undergo an intensive five-week training program led by experienced members of the guild concluding with an audition. The most skilled students are admitted to the group, and perform regularly on the carillon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51115">'''Yukos shareholders vs. Russia''' are several international court and arbitral cases seeking compensation from the government of [[Russia]] to the former shareholders of [[Yukos]] based on the claim that Russian courts were not acting in [[good faith]] in launching [[tax evasion]] criminal proceedings against Yukos, which led to the bankruptcy of the company. 

The Yukos Oil Company's former shareholders and management filed a series of claims in courts and before arbitration panels in various countries, seeking compensation for their expropriation. The largest, for over $100 billion, was filed at the international [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in [[The Hague]] in 2007&lt;ref&gt;Gregory L. White (September 21, 2011), [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111904194604576582142899283926 European Rights Court Delivers Split Yukos Ruling]{{subscription required}} ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irina Reznik, Henry Meyer and Alex Sazonov (July 14, 2014), [http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-N8JUOJ6JTSEH01-0BG24BFME6MJISINAU16TPFMSN Khodorkovsky Partners Turn Hunters as $140 Billion Rulings Near] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728115159/http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-N8JUOJ6JTSEH01-0BG24BFME6MJISINAU16TPFMSN |date=July 28, 2014 }} ''[[Washington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in the arbitrators awarding Yukos majority shareholders over US$50 billion in damages. This decision was appealed by Russia and overturned by the Hague's district court.

Observers note the bad timing of the final rulings on the majority shareholders' claim for Russia amid [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|the Ukrainian crisis]]. Russia intends to fight these decision of the international courts.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140729203029/http://bigstory.ap.org:80/article/russia-ordered-pay-50b-over-yukos Russia ordered to pay $50 billion over Yukos], ''[[Associated Press]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28520892 Russia to appeal against $50bn Yukos shareholder payout], ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-must-compensate-yukos-shareholders-says-european-court-1406797417 Russia Must Compensate Yukos Shareholders, Says European Court], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court proceedings of Yukos management==

===Claim in Houston court===

In 2005, Yukos unsuccessfully asked a US court in Houston to send its multibillion-dollar tax dispute with the Russian authorities to an international arbitration forum.&lt;ref&gt;Saeed Shah (February 2, 2005), [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/yukos-wants-international-arbitration-in-tax-dispute-6153370.html "Yukos wants international arbitration in tax dispute"], ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; By bringing the case in a US court, Yukos sought to focus international attention on its travails and increase pressure on Russian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB110310361370100724 Yukos Seeks Refuge in a U.S. Court"], by Gregory L. White, Russell Gold and Thaddeus Herrick, online.wsj.com, December 16, 2004; accessed August 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claim in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ===

====Application and admission====
On April 23, 2004, shortly after the imposition of the tax assessment for the year 2000, the former management of Yukos (OAO Neftyanaya kompaniya YUKOS) submitted an application to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyukoslibrary.com/en/jurisdictions/european-court-of-human-rights|title=European Court of Human Rights|publisher=Theyukoslibrary.com|date=2004-04-23|accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yukos’ claim in the ECHR argued that the company's rights, protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, were violated in Russian courts, which led to its bankruptcy and liquidation; it also argued that Yukos has been singled out for discriminatory treatment. Yukos officials complained that their rights were breached under several articles of the Convention, specifically:&lt;blockquote&gt;“Under Article 6 (right to a fair trial) of the Convention, the applicant company complains about various defects in the proceedings concerning its tax liability for the year 2000. Under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (protection of property), taken alone and in conjunction with Articles 1 (obligation to respect human rights), 13 (right to an effective remedy), 14 (prohibition of discrimination) and 18 (limitation on use of restrictions on rights) of the Convention, it complains about the lawfulness and proportionality of the 2000–2003 Tax Assessments and their subsequent enforcement, including the forced sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz. Lastly, the applicant company complains, under Article 7 (no punishment without law) of the Convention, about the lack of proper legal basis, selective and arbitrary prosecution and the imposition of double penalties in the Tax Assessment proceedings for the years 2000–2003.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press?i=003-3049480-3373009| title=Hearing OAO Neftyanaya kompaniya YUKOS v Russia 04.03.2010|publisher=European Court of Human Rights|date=2010-04-03|accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following an admissibility assessment that took five years, the court declared the Yukos application admissible on 29 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/echren.htm|title=European Court of Human Rights|publisher=Echr.coe.int|accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court declares admissible only less than 5% of all submitted applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyukoslibrary.com/en/jurisdictions/european-court-of-human-rights/the-decision-on-admissibility|title=The Decision on Admissibility|publisher=Theyukoslibrary.com|accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proceedings====
The hearing on merits of the Yukos Oil Company v Russia case in the European Court of Human Rights took place on 4 March 2010. Yukos Oil Company was represented by Piers Gardner, Barrister of Monckton Chambers. The Russian side was represented by a team of lawyers, which included Georgy Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, and British lawyer Michael Swainston. The claim before the ECHR amounted to US$98&amp;nbsp;billion – as majority shareholders did in the arbitration case before the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in The Hague – but later reduced the claim.&lt;ref name="buckley"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5927a632-18a3-11e4-a51a-00144feabdc0.html "Moscow ordered to pay Yukos shareholders €1.9bn"], by Neil Buckley, ''[[Financial Times]]'', July 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the largest claim to be brought in the court's history. The claim was an estimate of what the value of Yukos would have been if its assets had not been stripped away and the company had not been liquidated in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/business/global/04iht-yukos.html|work=The New York Times|title=European Court Ready to Hear Yukos Case|first=Andrew E.|last=Kramer|date=March 4, 2010|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was announced on September 20, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yukosnewsonline.com/yukosnewsonline/2011/09/european-court-of-human-rights-confirms-that-yukos-oil-company-was-treated-unfairly-by-russian-court.html|title=European Court of Human Rights confirms that YUKOS Oil Company was treated unfairly by Russian courts|publisher=Yukos News Online|date=2011-09-20|accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court announced that the Russian state violated the human rights of Yukos by agreeing there had been a violation of Yukos' right to fairness in legal proceedings in relation to a tax re-assessment for 2000. The court also established that there had been a violation of the right to protection of property through enforcement proceedings carried out over tax assessments from 2000 to 2003. The interpretation of the tax liabilities which were applied to Yukos was foreseeable, but the court still noted that the crux of the case was the rapid and inflexible enforcement of those liabilities. Yukos had been effectively paralysed because all of its assets were frozen from the first assessment. The court held that two factors in particular contributed to Yukos' demise and violated Article 1 of Protocol No. 1:

''''1. The bailiff's choice of Yukos' principal subsidiary as the first target for auction, without considering the implications for the company's future: this dealt Yukos a 'fatal blow';''

''2. The Russian authorities were unyielding and inflexible in response to requests for time to pay and the bailiffs imposed additional fines amounting to €1.15 Bn, which had to be paid before the taxes, but the payment of which was prohibited under the freezing orders."'' The court did however note that the tax assessments themselves were not considered disproportionate. It was agreed that there was not enough evidence to suggest that Yukos had been treated differently from other companies and so no violation of Article 14 was found. The court denied an allegation that Russia misused legal procedures to dismantle Yukos despite the court's nine-judge panel finding that Russia violated three articles of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The ECHR invited a claim for 'just satisfaction', or compensation, from Yukos, which sought compensation of just under 38 billion [[euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=European court rules Russia must pay Yukos shareholders 1.9 bln euros|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/31/russia-yukos-echr-idUSL6N0Q634Q20140731|publisher=reuters.com|date=2014-07-31|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These damages were being sought on behalf of all Yukos shareholders. There are around 55,000 named Yukos shareholders, some of which are funds representing a number of shareholders.

====Appeal====
Russia appealed against the ECHR ruling. In December 2014, however, the court rejected an appeal and decided Russia had six months to work out, together with the [[Council of Europe]], the continent's main human rights and democracy forum, a plan "for distribution of the award of just satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Baczynska (December 16, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/16/russia-yukos-idUSL6N0U04J620141216 Top rights court rejects Russia's appeal over Yukos compensation] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Russian Justice Minister [[Aleksandr Konovalov (politician, born 1968)|Aleksandr Konovalov]] commented: "The judges have made the decision.

In 2006, Yukos Capital obtained four [[International Court of Arbitration|ICC arbitration awards]] against [[Rosneft]] by a Russian tribunal in Moscow, totalling $245 million; mores specifically, the awards were against Rosneft's predecessor company, [[Yuganskneftegaz]], representing money owed to Yukos Capital under four loan agreements. The ruling was later overturned by the [[Supreme Court of Arbitration of Russia]] in 2007,&lt;ref name="mccool"&gt;Grant McCool (September 15, 2009), [http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/09/15/russia-rosneft-yukoscapital-idUSN155063720090915 Yukos Capital seeks U.S. court order on Rosneft] ''[[Reuters]]''; accessed July 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; but it gave Yukos Capital a chance to take its case to a Dutch court which also ordered Rosneft to pay up.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/15772900 Yukos haunts Rosneft: A spectre of litigation] ''[[The Economist]]'', March 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a decision dated April 28, 2009, the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam declared the awards enforceable. Subsequently, the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]] issued a final ruling in 2010 ordering Rosneft to pay $389.3 million in claims.&lt;ref name="belton"&gt;Catherine Belton, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f045c25c-8071-11df-be5a-00144feabdc0.html Dutch court orders Rosneft payment] {{subscription required}} ''[[Financial Times]]'', June 26, 2010; accessed July 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Dutch court decision, in 2010 Rosneft paid Yukos the value of the awards.

In June 2011, the [[Commercial Court (England and Wales)|English Commercial Court]] decided both issues in favour of Yukos, and Rosneft appealed to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]]. In 2012, the Court of Appeal rejected Yukos Capital's argument that the Dutch treatment of the Russian judgments binds the English courts in any respect, leaving [[Rosneft]] free to defend based on the Russian annulment decisions. In a separate part of the English judgment, the court held that the English [[Act of state doctrine]] does not impact certain arguments Yukos Capital seeks to make concerning the Russian annulment decisions. Yukos Capital had claimed interest on arbitration awards that were annulled by the Russian courts but the Amsterdam Court of Appeal nevertheless enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgsh.com/de/rosneft_obtains_favorable_decision_in_english_court_of_appeal Rosneft Obtains Favorable Decision in English Court of Appeal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728013551/http://www.cgsh.com/de/rosneft_obtains_favorable_decision_in_english_court_of_appeal |date=July 28, 2014 }}, June 27, 2012 press release, [[Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton]]; accessed July 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arbitration proceedings by shareholders==

===Arbitration proceedings by majority shareholders===
In 2005, GML Ltd. (formerly Group Menatep), the former owner of 60 percent of Yukos, filed a lawsuit under the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] before a tribunal at the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in The Hague.

The [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] handled the following cases:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-must-compensate-yukos-shareholders-says-european-court-1406797417 Permanner Court of Arbitration cases]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Hulley Enterprises Limited (Cyprus) v. The Russian Federation
:* Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. The Russian Federation
:* Veteran Petroleum Limited (Cyprus) v. The Russian Federation

The Energy Charter Treaty aims to promote [[international investment]] and co-operation in the [[energy industry]], and to stimulate [[foreign direct investment]] and [[global trade]], in part by reassuring potential international investors that their investment will receive fair treatment. GML drew on two main provisions for its case -

:* The treaty does not prevent governments from seizing or nationalizing commercial assets. However it requires that the investors must be fairly compensated if their assets are unfairly seized. 
:* Investors may seek arbitration for such claims against signatory governments, and rulings are legally binding and enforceable for both parties (subject to any [[appeal]]).

Although Russia did not ultimately [[ratification|ratify]] the full treaty, these clauses were still agreed as legally binding for a number of years, as part of the draft framework. European investments in Russian energy projects that took place before Russia agreed to leave the treaty still fall under the treaty's provision of protecting investments.&lt;ref&gt;Nikita Jolkver and Markian Ostaptschuk, [http://www.dw.de/ex-yukos-owners-demand-compensation-from-russia/a-17809414 "Ex-Yukos owners demand compensation from Russia"], ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', July 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the three-person tribunal&lt;ref name="reed"/&gt; led by Canadian lawyer [[Yves Fortier (lawyer)|Yves Fortier]]&lt;ref&gt;Irina Reznik, Henry Meyer &amp; Alex Sazonov, [http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-N8JUOJ6JTSEH01-0BG24BFME6MJISINAU16TPFMSN Khodorkovsky Partners Turn Hunters as $140 Billion Rulings Near] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728115159/http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-N8JUOJ6JTSEH01-0BG24BFME6MJISINAU16TPFMSN |date=July 28, 2014 }} ''[[Washington Post]]'', July 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ruled in 2009 that it would hear the case&lt;ref&gt;Jason Bush, [http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2009/12/01/yukos-returns-to-haunt-russia/ Yukos returns to haunt Russia] ''[[Reuters]]'', December 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Veteran Petroleum Trust, a corporate pension fund covering 30,000 ex-Yukos employees,&lt;ref name="buckley"/&gt; as well as two companies that own Yukos shares — all represented by GML – could seek payments from the Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew E.

===Arbitration proceedings by minority shareholders===
Two arbitration tribunals in Stockholm in 2010 and 2012 ruled in favor of Yukos investors from the United Kingdom and Spain who demanded compensation under [[Bilateral investment treaty|bilateral investment protection treaties]].

In 2010, the tribunal decided that the Russian state's measures constituted an unlawful expropriation because their effect was intended to “destroy Yukos and gain control over its assets”, thus marking the first instance where an international court or tribunal ruled on the merits of an expropriation claim filed against Russia by former Yukos investors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klgates.com/arbitration-world-04-29-2011 "World Investment Treaty Arbitration Update", by Lisa Richman (Washington, D.C.), Hugh A.

This put the value of Yukos at the time at $62.1 billion, which would be $83 billion with interest added.&lt;ref name="marson"/&gt;

==== Russian appeal ====
Russia sought a [[Declaratory judgment|declaratory judgment action]] asking to declare that the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce tribunal lacked jurisdiction. The challenge was escalated to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden]], which decided in 2012 that it could proceed. In 2014, the Stockholm District Court eventually dismissed Russia’s challenge and also concluded that despite Russia’s objections, the Spanish funds should be awarded costs.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Moore (September 12, 2014), [http://admin.www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/2872-covington-and-baker-botts-act-as-yukos-minority-shareholders-defeat-russia Covington and Baker Botts act as Yukos minority shareholders defeat Russia] ''Legal Business''.&lt;/ref&gt;
