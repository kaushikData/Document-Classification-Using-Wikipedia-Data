An '''assured tenancy''' is a legal category of residential tenancy to an individual (or individuals jointly) in [[English land law]]. Statute affords a tenant under an assured tenancy a degree of security of tenure. A tenant under an assured tenancy may not be evicted without a reasonable ground in the [[Housing Act 1988]] and, where periodic,{{refn|As opposed to fixed term; and without any specified end date, but not a statutory periodic tenancy which is the relationship imputed (implied) after a fixed term tenancy has ended (see [[tenancy at will]])|group= n}} changes in rent are potentially subject to a challenge before a [[rent assessment committee]].

Assured tenancies were introduced by the Housing Act 1988 that applies to tenancies entered from its commencement date or those assured tenancies it converted from the [[Housing Act 1980]].  The Act replaced most of the greater rent protection under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and in rarer cases, other [[Rent Act]]s.{{refn|The Rent Act 1977 was enacted under the [[Labour Government 1974–1979]] and provided more extensive, administratively burdensome rental assessments.|group= n}}  However, since 28 February 1997, all new residential tenancies with three exceptions are deemed to be [[assured shorthold tenancy|assured shorthold tenancies]].&lt;ref name=cprt&gt;''Commercial Property'': Part III - Residential Tenancies, P. Butt, College of Law Publishing (Guildford), 2008 {{ISBN|978 1905391448}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209}}  These exceptions are those excluded by notice before or after the tenancy, those specifying it is not a shorthold, and lettings to existing assured tenants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/52/part/III/chapter/II Housing Act 1996] s.96 and more generally ss 96-102 (i.e. Chapter 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

The assured tenancy replaced the [[secure tenancy]], with greater tenant protections, introduced by the Housing Act 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ageuk.org.uk/Documents/EN-GB/Factsheets/FS68_Tenancy_rights_security_of_tenure_fcs.pdf?dtrk=true|title=Factsheet 68 - Tenancy rights – security of tenure|publisher=Age UK|date=June 2017}} Document explaining all the different types of tenancy for England and Wales, and their conditions.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-assured (or assured shorthold) tenancies==
; Tenancies entered into before the commencement of the 1988 Act on 15 January 1989
An exception to this are assured tenancies which are converted from being regulated by the [[Housing Act 1980]] (except if granted by approved bodies under ss56-68 of the Housing Act 1980 before 15 January 1989, and before that date the tenant made an application to the court under section 24 of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] (for the grant of a new tenancy), and on 15 January 1989 the 1980 Act tenancy is continuing by virtue of that section or of any provision of Part IV of the said Act of 1954.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/37 Housing Act 1988 s37]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Tenancies not of a separate dwelling house
The term seemingly denoting "home", dwelling house, has been held to apply widely by the Courts, to exclude only businesses and highly indistinct factual arrangements of accommodation within a house or a flat (where the home is shared in an esoteric manner and no particular tenant or set of joint tenants can be said to be entitled exclusively the whole of any one part and anti-exclusion case law does not operate); flats and single rooms are included within the definition of a separate dwelling house as are converted barns, windmills etc.&lt;ref name=cprt/&gt;{{rp|300-301}}

;High-value properties
Because domestic rates were abolished a distinction exists between tenancies granted before 1 April 1990 and those from that date. Before this a ''dwelling house'' (see above) tenancy with a rateable value of £750 (£1,500 in Greater London) (payable per year) cannot be an assured tenancy.  From this date if the rent is more than £100,000 per year (£8,333.33 per month) it cannot be an assured tenancy.&lt;ref name=cprt/&gt;{{rp|300-301}}&lt;ref name=schedule&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/schedule/1 Housing Act 1988 Schedule 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/908/article/3/made#text%3DAssured%20Tenancies The Assured Tenancies (Amendment)(England) Order 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Tenancies at a low rent
Similar for those tenancies before that date, if rent is less than two-thirds of the rateable value, or if after that date it does not exceed £250 per year (£1,000 per year in Greater London) it cannot be an assured tenancy.&lt;ref name=cprt/&gt;{{rp|300-301}}

;Tenancies for agriculture, agricultural holdings, persons with Temporary Protection, under arrangements made for asylum seekers and their dependents, and family intervention tenancies&lt;ref name=schedule/&gt;
These detailed areas include a tenancy under which agricultural land, exceeding two acres, is let together with the dwelling-house.&lt;ref&gt;Sch 1. Paragraph 6(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

;Business tenancies
To be exact this excludes tenancies to which part II of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] applies. Tenancies eligible to be protected business tenancies (contracted out business tenancies) or partly let for business use are ineligible to be assured tenancies.&lt;ref name=cprt/&gt;{{rp|300-301}}

;Educational body lettings to students
This does not apply to tenancies involving landlords other than the specified universities and colleges.&lt;ref name=cprt/&gt;{{rp|300-301}}

;Holiday lettings
A letting for this purpose cannot be assured.&lt;ref name=cprt/&gt;{{rp|300-301}}

;By live-in landlords
This applies where the landlord lives in another part of the same building in which the let accommodation is situated.&lt;ref name=cprt/&gt;{{rp|300-301}}

;Crown, local authority and housing association lettings
Although these are excluded, lettings by local authorities and housing association may have other protections, such as secure tenancies under the [[Housing Act 1985]].&lt;ref name=cprt/&gt;{{rp|300-301}}

;In occupation as the principal home of the tenant
It is possible for a person to have more than one "home" in which case it is a legal question of fact as to whether a home is the principal home.  Although this provision stipulates "occupation" this need not be continuous, if a mere temporary absence this will still be capable of being an assured tenancy.&lt;ref name=cprt/&gt;{{rp|300-301}}

;If-and-so-long-as
Whether a tenancy is assured can vary depending on circumstances after the tenancy commencement.  It may be that the tenant has not by eviction ceased to live in a tenancy in which case they are no longer occupying the dwelling as their principal home.  Here the tenant thus loses security of tenure.&lt;ref name=cprt{{rp|300-301}}

== Security of tenure ==

Security of tenure operates in a slightly different way depending on whether the tenancy is a periodic or fixed-term tenancy.

If the tenancy is periodic, it will only come to an end either by an order of the court or by [[surrender (law)|surrender]] by the tenant.

If the tenancy is a fixed term tenancy, it may be ended either by the effluxion of time{{refn|Contrast fixed-term ''non-contracted-out'' (notice-excluded and declared receipt of tenant acknowledged) Business Tenancies under Part II of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]]|group= n}} automatically expiring, with no need to serve any notice, at the end of the fixed term&lt;ref&gt;''Property Law and Practice'', P. Butt and N. Duckworth, College of Law Publishing, Guildford ({{ISBN|978 1 905391387}} (2007) Chapter 3.8&lt;/ref&gt; or, if the tenancy agreement gives the landlord a power to end the tenancy, by the landlord exercising that power. If a fixed term assured tenancy comes to an end in one of these ways but occupation continues, known as ''holding over'', a periodic assured tenancy will from that event be created, known as a '''statutory periodic tenancy'''. Security of tenure remains.

In order to regain possession, the landlord may do so only on one of a number of statutory grounds, which are set out in Schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1988.{{refn|s.7(1)|group= n}}&lt;ref name=ha&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/contents Housing Act 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain an order for possession, the landlord must serve a ''[[section 8 Notice|section 8 notice]]'' on the tenant, setting out the ground or grounds that are relied on and then, after a period of time that varies depending on the grounds chosen, apply to the court for possession.

Unlawful eviction of a tenant is a criminal offence (under s1 of the [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]]) unless the landlord reasonably believed the tenant was no longer in the premises, is sharing living accommodation with the tenant or is letting the property for holiday purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/43/contents Protection of Eviction Act 1977]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increases of rent==
Rent without specific provision under an assured, periodic tenancy cannot be increased within 52 weeks of commencement, and unless a statutory (implied) periodic tenancy, this may only be increased upon the service of a ''section 13 notice''&lt;ref name=thirteen&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/13 Housing Act 1988 s. 13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.painsmith.co.uk/Shop/Shop-_Notices Landlord and Tenant Solicitors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624073305/http://www.painsmith.co.uk/Shop/Shop-_Notices |date=2012-06-24 }} - examples of notices&lt;/ref&gt; in the appropriate form for England or for Wales, however as with general contract law a historic lease amendment or new lease neglecting such a notice before such an increase accepted by the tenant will be deemed to have supervened, preventing the tenant from relying on an earlier contract in not serving a section 13 notice.

Naturally where fixed term and not periodic, and where a rent review clause exists in the periodic tenancy, contractual arrangements also avoid the need for the section 13 notice.&lt;ref name=thirteen/&gt;  The section 13 notice gives the right to the tenant to challenge the rent set under section 14 before a [[rent assessment committee]] where it is unreasonable that the market would charge such a rent, disregarding improvements performed by the tenant to the property where they were not obliged to carry these out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/14 Housing Act 1988 s.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with assured shorthold tenancies==
From 28 February 1997 most tenancies are deemed to be [[assured shorthold tenancy|assured shorthold tenancies]] (ASTs) under which the landlord has an absolute right to possession where having served a notice on the tenant, before this date they had to be accompanied by a prescribed warning, fixed term, and for at least six months.

The only aspect of a shorthold which allows the tenant some control over the tenancy is the right of the tenant to refer the rent initially payable to a [[rent assessment committee]], however it can reduce the rent only if it is "significantly higher" than the rents under other comparable assured shortholds. In this unusual scenario, the landlord can serve a notice before or after the tenancy has begun stating it is not to be a shorthold, where no rent assessment application has been made.&lt;ref name=cprt/&gt;{{rp|309-311}}  In other regards, except security of tenure, as a subset of assured tenancies these follow the definition requirements of an assured tenancies.&lt;ref name=cprt/&gt;{{rp|310}}

'''Audit Bureau of Jordan''' is an independent [[Government agency]] and a supreme [[audit]] institution which is responsible for auditing the [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]], public institutions, public departments, [[municipalities]], [[co-operatives]], [[labor unions]], [[corporations]] where Government of [[Jordan]] has more than 50% of their shares, and any entity the [[Cabinet of Jordan|Council of Ministers]] may entrust the Bureau to audit its accounts.

==History==
The Audit Bureau of Jordan was established since 1952, under the Audit Bureau's Law of 1952, which has been issued in accordance with the Jordan Constitution to audit the revenues and expenditures of the state and ways of expenditure.

The public audit function in Jordan has a much longer date and has passed through various stages and amendments that were closely corresponded to the progress of the political, economical, and legislative conditions in Jordan.

===Accounts Audit Department===
The auditing function started on January 1928, where an audit branch named the "Accounts Review Department" was established in the [[Emirate of Transjordan]], it had been charged with reviewing the financial accounts of the Emirate. Late 1930, the audit branch had been altered to a department, and was renamed with "Accounts Audit Department" under the ministerial resolution published in the Official Gazette No.271, 9 August 1930.

===Department of Audit and Verification of Accounts===
The Department of Audit and [[Authentication|Verification]] of Accounts was established in 1931 when the a Law of Audit and Verification of Accounts was passed under which the department had been attached to the Prime Ministry, in 1939 it was disconnected from the Prime Ministry and connected to the Ministry of Finance. It was connected back and forth between the [[Prime Minister of Jordan|Prime Ministry]] and the [[Ministry of Finance]] until 1952, the year in which the Law of the Audit Bureau of Jordan passed.

===Audit Bureau===
This is the stage in which the Audit Bureau as a constitutional body has been established in 1952, in accordance with the [[Constitution of Jordan]] which was issued on 8/2/1952{{clarify|date=February 2012}}. Article 119 stipulates "Bureau act was set to monitor the State's revenues, expenditures and ways of expenditure". Five [[Constitutional amendment|amendments]] to this Law were issued over the last fifty years, to keep pace with the political, economic, and social developments.

==Duties==
* Present an annual [[Auditor's report]] to the [[Parliament of Jordan|House of Representatives]] which includes; any [[Accounting irregularity|irregularities]], deficiencies, or weaknesses in the performance of the audited entities, together with its recommendations for addressing these irregularities, at the beginning of the ordinary session of the [[Parliament of Jordan|Parliament]], and at any time the House of Representatives may requires the Audit Bureau to provide it with any audit report.

The '''Australian Local Government Association''' ('''ALGA''') is the principal organisation representing [[Local government in Australia|Local Government]] bodies in [[Australia]], and acts as the independent interest body for Australian local mayors, councillors and local government employees. The association is the federal branch of local government associations in each state and territory.

==Constituent members==
*[[Local Government NSW]]
*[[Local Government Association of Northern Territory]]
*[[Local Government Association of Queensland]]
*[[Local Government Association of South Australia]]
*[[Local Government Association of Tasmania]]
*[[Municipal Association of Victoria]]
*[[Western Australian Local Government Association]]

==Role==
* Sustaining local roads, transport and other infrastructure
* Improving natural and built environmental outcomes
* Enhancing regional equity and regional development
* Building capacity and sustainability in local communities
* Connecting member associations and the Local Government sector
* Engaging effectively in Australian Government processes

As one of Australia's three spheres of government, local government is represented by ALGA's President on the [[Council of Australian Governments]] (COAG). This peak government body brings together the Prime Minister, state premiers, territory chief ministers and the ALGA President to develop responses to issues of concern to all three spheres of government.

ALGA was founded in 1947 and, in 1976, established a secretariat in Canberra reflecting growing links with the Australian Government and an awareness of local government's emerging national role.

The Association's policies are determined by the ALGA Board, consisting of two representatives from each of the member associations and two from the ACT Government.

ALGA's leadership team comprises the President and two Vice Presidents. The secretariat is managed by the Chief Executive.  The President of ALGA, Mayor [[David O'Loughlin (Australian politician)|David O'Loughlin]], [[City of Prospect]] also sits on the Council of Australian Governments ([[Council of Australian Governments|COAG]]).

The '''Battle of Ventersdorp''' was a violent confrontation on 9 August 1991 in the [[South African]] town of [[Ventersdorp]] between supporters of the far-right [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] (AWB) and the [[South African Police]] and security forces. Though technically not a "[[battle]]", it became known as such in the media while official sources such as the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) simply refer to it as an "incident". Much of its notoriety lies in the fact that it marked the first occasion the South African security forces used lethal force against right-wing white protesters since the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]'s ascension to power in 1948.

==Background==
[[File:AWB Rally, Church Square, Pretoria.jpg|thumb|AWB Rally, Church Square, Pretoria in 1990.]]
The confrontation took place outside the Ventersdorp town hall where then [[State President of South Africa|State President]] [[Frederik Willem de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]] was scheduled to hold a public address. Ventersdorp was then a political stronghold of the right-wing [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] (AWB), which had opposed de Klerk's decision to recognise the [[African National Congress]] and release [[Nelson Mandela]] the previous year. The town was inundated by angry AWB supporters the day of de Klerk's speech, including some carrying arms. The [[South African Police]] responded by setting up roadblocks and confiscating weapons. Tensions were running high between the police and the AWB due to a previous incident on 11 May 1991, when a group of policemen wounded four AWB militants attempting to drive black squatters off a Ventersdorp farm.

==Confrontation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2007}}
The AWB supporters numbered 2,000. They were armed with hunting rifles and pistols and wore protective items to shield them from the effects of an inevitable tear gas attack by the riot police. The police equalled the AWB in number, but were considerably better trained and equipped.

Many unconventional tactics were employed by the AWB. They allegedly wore plaster of Paris on their limbs to protect them from police dogs. Video footage shows AWB members locking arms and carrying rags and vinegar to lessen the effects of tear gas.

Once the AWB cut the electricity and fired on the police, the police were ordered to shoot to kill. Three policemen were wounded, none of them fatally, while the police killed one AWB member. The AWB also fired into a police minibus. Two AWB members were killed and 13 were injured when the police returned fire from the minibus.

Terre'Blanche made a point of appearing in front on television cameras and said (in Afrikaans), "Where is De Klerk? I want to talk to him. He came here armed. Here lies a man on the ground and over there lies a man" (referring to injured policemen).

In all, three AWB members and one passer-by were killed. Six policemen, 13 AWB members, and 29 civilians were injured.

==Aftermath==
The growing conflict between right-wing groupings and the government has been identified as one of the most significant developments in the course of 1991, with the Battle of Ventersdorp as its high point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Graeme Simpson |author2=Janine Rauch |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Political Violence: 1991 |editor=Boister, N. |editor2=Ferguson-Brown, K |journal=Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, Human Rights Yearbook 1992, First Edition |pages=212–239 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Cape Town |year=1993 |url=http://www.csvr.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=709&amp;Itemid=188 |accessdate=1 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819235417/http://www.csvr.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=709&amp;Itemid=188 |archivedate=19 August 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events in Ventersdorp, as well as gains by the right-wing opposition in white by-elections, led De Klerk to call a [[South African referendum, 1992|referendum]] in March 1992. The referendum confirmed white support for the negotiation process, despite continued opposition from the far right.

Following the end of apartheid, Terre'Blanche and his supporters sought amnesty for the Battle of Ventersdorp and other acts. Amnesty was granted by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]]|title=Amnesty decision AC/99/0221|year=1999|url=http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/decisions/1999/ac990221.htm|accessdate=11 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]]|title=Amnesty hearing|date=11 May 1999|url=http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/amntrans/1999/99051011_klk_990511kl.htm|accessdate=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/media/1999/9905/p990510a.htm|title=Terre'Blanche calls for De Klerk to answer at his amnesty hearing|publisher=SAPA|date=11 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three dead AWB members, A.F. Badenhorst, G.J. Koen and J.D. Conradie were honoured at an AWB ceremony in October 1994, in Ventersdorp.

'''Busy work''' (also referred to as '''make-work''' and '''busywork''') can refer to activity that is undertaken to pass time and stay busy but in and of itself has no actual value.  Busy work also occurs in business, military and other settings, in situations where people may be required to be present but may lack the opportunities, skills or need to do something more productive. People may engage in busy work to maintain an appearance of activity, in order to avoid criticism of being inactive or idle. The Merriam Webster dictionary defines busywork as "work that usually appears productive or of intrinsic value but actually only keeps one occupied." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/busywork|title=Definition of BUSYWORK|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational settings==
In the context of education, busy work allows students to work independently, to test their own knowledge and skills, and to practice using new skills [[Learning|learned]] in the educational setting.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"&gt;(1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=n2BMAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Plans for busy work - Boston Primary Teachers' Association - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It can consist of various types of [[schoolwork]] assigned by a teacher to keep students occupied with activities involving learning and cognition while the teacher focuses upon another group of students.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt; The functionality of busy work is associated with levels of interest students have with the content of the work, levels of enjoyment students have in performing the work, how purposeful the work is, and how accomplishment of the work is perceived by students.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt; The perceived results of the work by students is significant: when students feel that they've succeeded in accomplishing a functional task, it's congruent with learning and the attainment of new skills.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt;

Busy work can also be used to keep the students occupied with educational tasks during idle times, such as instances when time in school remains but the day's curriculum has already concluded.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt;  This application of busy work to consume idle time was common in [[primary education]], but the need for work to have educational content, rather than existing just to consume time, is now preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=475 |chapter=Busy work |author=[[Paul Monroe]] |title=A Cyclopedia of Education |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Busy work has historical precedent in [[primary education]]. Conditioning students to believe that busy work carries the same value as progressive work can lead to students maintaining this belief later in life, carrying it through to the workplace.

==Business and work settings==
[[File:Lightmatter paperwork.jpg|thumb|The constant processing of [[wikt:paperwork|paperwork]] can be a form of busy work, particularly in situations when it is a lower priority compared to other tasks.]]
In business and work settings, people may engage in busy work simply to appear like they're being busy and productive, with the primary goal of actually simply maintaining an ''appearance'' of activity in efforts to protect their employment status (to avoid [[termination of employment|termination]] or sanctions).&lt;ref name="Slack"&gt;(2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3AuP7HV14SYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency - Tom DeMarco - Google Books &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Workers believe that it is more important to maintain a constant appearance of working urgently so that they and others believe that what is being done is important. Constant urgency in workers can lead to disproportionate distribution of actual work, as workers may put off important work by attempting to complete previously-designated less important work. Maintaining very high levels of constant busyness may actually be detrimental to the operations of a business or organization in which new tasks are not undertaken in a timely manner because workers are always very busy.&lt;ref name="Slack"/&gt; That can also lead to workers taking shortcuts to accomplish tasks more quickly, which can negatively affect the quality of work results.&lt;ref name="Slack"/&gt; Busy work also can be counterproductive in work settings because it may not be aligned with the overall objectives and priorities of an organization's plans for attaining and maintaining success in its ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkotter/2012/01/19/why-busy-work-doesnt-work/ | title=Why Busy Work Doesn't Work | publisher=Forbes Magazine | date=January 19, 2012 | accessdate=September 1, 2012 | author=Kotter, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption that activity in the workplace is more important than productivity in the workplace can lead to employees thinking that quantity of work is better than quality of work, which is not productive to the overall functioning of a business.

==Military settings==
Busy work is used in armed forces to keep servicemembers from becoming bored, inactive and idle.  Tasks of this sort include [[military parade|drill]], memorizing regulations, getting haircuts, [[spit and polish]]ing footwear and other cleaning chores such as [[holystone|scrubbing the deck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=356 |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Daily Life in America: The War of Independence and antebellum expansion and reform, 1763-1861 |author=Randall M.

{{Redirect|Dei Gratia}}
{{more footnotes|date=February 2013}}
'''By the Grace of God''' ([[Latin]] '''''Dei Gratia''''', abbreviated '''D.G.''') is an introductory part of the full styles of a [[monarch]] historically considered to be ruling by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]], not a title in its own right. In the United Kingdom, for example, the phrase was added to the royal style in 1521 and has continued to be used to this day. According to the "Royal Proclamation reciting the altered Style and Titles of the Crown" of May 29, 1953, the latest such change of royal title, [[Elizabeth II]]'s present full title is

{{quote|[[Elizabeth II]], '''by the Grace of God''' of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, [[Head of the Commonwealth]], [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]].}}

In other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, [[List_of_titles_and_honours_of_Queen_Elizabeth_II#Royal_titles_and_styles|variations of the style]] are used, specifying the realm in question and varying some of the other elements of the title.

==History and rationale==
{{Main|Divine right of kings}}
Originally, it had a literal meaning: the divine will was invoked—notably by Christian monarchs—as legitimation (the only one above every earthly power) for the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] authority the monarch wielded. This is also known as the [[divine right of kings]], that is, the endorsement of [[God]] for the monarch's reign.

While the Christian [[Roman emperors]] during the late [[Dominate]], especially in the East (as continued in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] after the fall of Rome), came remarkably close to acting out the role of God's voice on earth, centralizing all power in their hands, e.g. reducing the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] to their "(State) Minister of the Cult" and proclaiming their "universal" authority (in the Oriental tradition, as in [[Persia]], but also in the original Muslim [[Caliphate]]), for most dynasties it would rather prove to be a never-ending battle up the hills of political resistance, both from rival power poles within their state (nobility, clergy; even within a dynasty) and from foreign powers claiming [[independence]] or even [[hegemony]], usually constraining them in [[constitution]]al limitations (not necessarily written statutes, more often a matter of customary law and established privileges).

By custom, the phrase "by the Grace of God" is restricted to [[sovereignty|sovereign]] rulers; in the feudal logic, a [[vassal]] could not use it, because he held his [[fief]] not by the grace of God almighty, but by grant of a superior noble, (in)directly from the crown. Yet this did not stop kings to continue using it, even when some of them did [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to the pope (as [[viceregent of God]]) or another ruler (sometimes even mutually), on account of some (minor or "external") fief, or even for their actual principality, such as the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], a state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

While the "incantation" of divine Grace became a prestigious style figure that few Christian monarchies could resist, it is not a literal carte-blanche from Heaven, but rather a consecration of the "sacred" mystique of the crown. Some of that survives even in modern constitutional monarchies and finds expression in most even mildly religious republics and dictatorships, where all power has been transferred to elected (party) politicians. In modern, especially recently (re-)founded monarchies, more realistic power reports (often crucially a voice in the succession and the purse strings) do in time find expression, sometimes even in abandoning "By the Grace of God", or rather, especially earlier, in the intercalation of compensatory phrases, such as "and the will of the people", or replacing the genitive "sovereign of X-place" by "sovereign of the X-inhabitants", quite meaningful where linked to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-notion of the "[[social contract]]", which means the nominal 'sovereign' is in fact potentially subject to national approval, without which a [[revolution]] against him can be legitimate.

The phrase was used in Luxembourg until 2000, when [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Henri]], the current [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke]], decided to drop it. Like the use of the term "subject" for the citizens of a monarchy, "by the Grace of God" is a protocolary form that has survived the emancipation of the electorate from its once absolute rulers, who now rule only in name, but without direct political power. During the 20th century during the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Spain]], Spanish coins bore a legend identifying him as ''Francisco Franco, por la G. de Dios Caudillo de España'' ("by the G(race) of God, Leader of Spain").

Parallels exist in other civilizations, e.g. [[Mandate of Heaven]] of the Chinese empire, where for centuries the official decrees by the Emperors of China invariably began with the phrase 「奉天承運皇帝，詔曰」 which is translated as "The Emperor, by the Grace of Heaven, decrees".

==Contemporary usage==
Today, even though all western monarchies are constitutional, with all political power having passed to the people (by [[referendum]] or, generally, elections), the traditional phrase "by the grace of God" is still included in the full titles and styles of a number of monarchs. In Europe, monarchs still using the style are those of [[Denmark]], [[Liechtenstein]], the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

In other Commonwealth realms, who share the same monarch with the United Kingdom, the style is used in [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Australia]], [[The Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[Canada]], [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], [[New Zealand]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], [[St Lucia]], [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]], and [[Tuvalu]]. [[Papua New Guinea]] does not use the style.

The phrase is not used in the monarchies of [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] (Jean, abdicated 2000), [[Monaco]], [[Norway]] (Haakon VII, died 1957),  and [[Sweden]] (Gustav VI Adolf, died 1973). In Spain, article 56(2) of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|1978 constitution]], states that the title of the King of Spain is simply "King of Spain" (''Rey de España'') but that he "can use the titles that correspond to the Crown". As a result, the King of Spain may use "by the grace of God", but this is not used on official documents.

'''Carlo Lotti''' (30 March 1916 &amp;ndash; 6 March 2013) was an [[Italians|Italian]] engineer and professor of hydraulic construction. He created the C. Lotti &amp; Associati engineering firm. He was born and died in [[Rome]].

==Biography==
Lotti graduated from the Roman Institute of Technology at the top of his class. He served in [[World War II]] until the ceasefire of September 1943 and then decided to join the liberated southern Italy and became captain.

Lotti lectured on “Methodology of hydraulic works” at the Roman Technical University. His professional career started in 1946 with Cidonio construction company. In 1957 he founded the engineering company bearing his name.

Lotti married Marcella Bini MD and had two children. His daughter, Patrizia is the president of the Society and his son, Massimo, is a lawyer.
In 1977 Carlo was nominated as a Knight of the Republic by the president of Italy. He founded the association of civil engineers in Italy (OICE) and was the honorary president of the Italian Hydrotechnical Association.

==Major projects==
Lotti participated in numerous projects, from 1957 together with his associates and then as a company C. Lotti &amp; Associati SpA.

===Dams in Africa===
The first project in [[Africa]] on behalf [[UNDP]], concerned the economic feasibility of agricultural production and river transport.

In 1973 the [[European Community]] entrusted Lotti for the construction of a dam on the [[Sankarani river]], tributary to the [[Niger River|Niger]], near the town of Sélingué. The 35m high dam was completed under the supervision of the designer in 1980. The electric power generated non only covers the domestic demand but it is also exported to the neighboring countries. Furthermore, the dam controls the flood, and, above all, provides for a rich fishery.

The creation of the [[Bakolori Dam|Bakolori dam]] in the Northern [[Nigeria]], in collaboration with Nuovo Castoro company, is of great importance. The project includes a large dam equipped with 3MW hydropower plant and the irrigation scheme for 23000 ha. A second project in the area was the [[Goronyo Dam]] with a reservoir of one billion m³.

===River basin planning===
The complete [[Drainage basin|basin]] planning requires the participation of experts from several sectors: [[hydrology]], [[hydraulics]], [[agriculture]], [[economy]], [[engineering]] and others. A mathematical is capable of handling all factors together. The methodology was developed at the [[Harvard University]]. Important project derived from the collaboration between Lotti and the Harvard group for optimal use of water resources.

A first project concerned the [[Sava|Sava river]], tributary to the [[Danube]]. The UNDP project was assigned jointly to Lotti and Hydroject of Prague. The model selected 32 reservoirs out of the 57 examined.

The first application of the method within Italy was the Tiber project, under the direction of IRSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.irsa.cnr.it/index.php?&amp;lang=it |title= IRSA - Istituto di Ricerca sulle Acque |trans-title= IRSA - Water Research Institute |publisher= Irsa.cnr.it |accessdate= 2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the disastrous flood in 1966, that severely damaged the historical center of town, it was imperative to examine the possible solution for flood protection. The complexity of the project led to the application of a mathematical model. The result of the model indicates the optimal set of works needed for the use of the waters.

The [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia Region]] contains several tributaries to the [[Po (river)|Po]] river. A complex network of [[Artificial waterway|artificial canals]] connects these rivers. The projects analyzes the resources and the demand for different uses. The company Idroser of the Emilia Region participated in the project and was entrusted for the implementation.

The Plan for the Waters of the [[Sardinia]] region analyzed all the aspects of the current and potential future uses of the waters. In a first phase data were collected on hydrology and potential water demand. In the next phase the existing and possible future works were studied. The third phase applied the data to a mathematical model for the selection of the optimal solution that can satisfy the future demand and provide protection against flood hazard.

Lotti created a research institute, Hydrocontrol, specializing on water resources. The institute trained thirty young researchers.

The quality of the waters of the Piracicaba basin in [[Brazil]] was studied with a mathematical model. The result indicates the degree of treatment necessary.

===Messina bridge===
Lotti participated in the international contest for the design of the bridge across the [[Strait of Messina|Messina strait]]. The area of relevant study regarded a new under water foundation procedure. The solution presented received a price but the final choice for construction is based a single span, which will be the longest in the world.

===Flood control in China===
Lotti went to [[China]] for the first time in 1971 with the Italian Foreign Commerce Ministry delegation. Successively, a project for flood control management started in 1982. The Italian Technical Cooperation financed the project.  The aim of the projects was not only the development of the plan but included the training of the personnel and supply of a pilot measuring network. The study area was the river [[Han River (Yangtze River tributary)|Han]], tributary to [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]. A large dam was built for flood control and hydropower. The optimal management of the dam is of great economic and environmental significance. Another, similar project concerned the river [[Huai River|Huai]].

===Municipal water network===
The loss of  water in municipal network represents and significant reduction of the available resources. The detection and repair of the losses is a convenient way of finding “new resources”.

Lotti carried out several project with help instruments and mathematical models for the search of losses.  In Messina, {{cvt|455|km |abbr=off}} of pipe was examined and the relevant measuring instruments put in operation. Similar projects were carried in [[Province of Reggio Calabria|Reggio Calabria]], [[Catania]], in [[Aosta]].

Also outside of Italy, water networks were monitored, e.g., [[Bucharest]] in [[Romania]], [[Durrës]] in [[Albania]], in [[Ukraine]], in [[Moldavia]], and in [[Nkayi, Republic of the Congo|Nkayi, Congo]].

'''Comparative cultural studies''' is a contextual approach to the study of culture in a global and intercultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|title=Comparative Cultural Studies|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=October 32, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focus is placed on the theory, method, and application of the study process(es) rather than on the "what" of the object(s) of study.

==Overview==
In comparative cultural studies, selected tenets of [[comparative literature]] are merged with selected tenets of the field of [[cultural studies]] (including [[cultural theory|culture theories]], (radical) [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]], [[communication]] theories, and [[systems theories]]) with the objective to study culture and culture products (including but not restricted to literature, communication, media, art, etc.). This is performed in a contextual and relational construction and with a plurality of methods and approaches, interdisciplinary, and, if and when required, including teamwork. In comparative cultural studies, it is the processes of communicative action(s) in culture and the how of these processes that constitute the main objectives of research and study. However, scholarship in comparative cultural studies does not exclude [[textual analysis]] proper of other established fields of study. In comparative cultural studies, ideally, the framework of and methodologies available in the systemic and empirical study of culture are favored. Scholarship in comparative cultural studies includes the theoretical, as well as methodological and applied postulate to move and to dialogue between cultures, languages, literature, and disciplines: attention to other cultures against essentialist notions and practices and beyond the paradigm of the nation-state is a basic and founding element of the framework and its application.

'''Dil Bahadur Lama''' (21 March 1930 – 25 March 2014), popularly known as '''DB Lama''' was a leader of [[Nepali Congress (Democratic)]] and former [[Inspector General of Nepal Police|Inspector General]] of [[Nepal Police]].&lt;ref name="nn"&gt;[http://www.nepalnews.com/contents/ English weekly/spotlight/2002/jan/jan04/offtherecord.htm OFF THE RECORD (Spotlight Weekly)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nepalpolice.gov.np/police-history/ex-chief-of-police.html | title=Police History - Ex-Chief of Police | accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[Pratinidhi Sabha]] in the [[Nepalese legislative election, 1999|1999 election]] on behalf of the [[Nepali Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.election-commission.org.np/toptwo.php |title=Election Commission of Nepal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012034141/http://www.election-commission.org.np/toptwo.php |archivedate=12 October 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he was included as an Assistant Minister of General Administration in [[Sher Bahadur Deuba]]'s expanded cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fesnepal.org/reports/2001/political_report01.htm |title=FES |access-date=18 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705073759/http://www.fesnepal.org/reports/2001/political_report01.htm |archive-date=5 July 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that cabinet he served under Minister of General Administration [[Khem Raj Bhatt Mayalu]]. After the [[Loktantra Andolan|2006 uprising against monarchy in Nepal]], Lama was included in a Parliamentary Sub-Committee, organized to investigate the assets of the [[King Gyanendra|king]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/content.php?nid=5752 |title=GORKHAPATRA |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928102654/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/content.php?nid=5752 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in law enforcement==
Lama had, in his function as a police official, issued an arrest warrant in the 1980s for Mayalu, who was then considered as a [[terrorism|terrorist]] by the Nepalese government.&lt;ref name="nn"/&gt; 

Dil Bahadur Lama had joined the [[Nepal Police]] on Fagun 28, 2007 BS as the Warrant Officer 1 at the then Sadar Nepal Armed Constabulary and upgraded to the IGP post on Asar 1, 2039 BS. The Nepal Police hospital, school and community police service was established during his tenure. Considered, by many of his former colleagues, one of the most influential [[Inspector General of Nepal Police|chief of Nepal Police]], Lama is credited with establishing Nepal Police Hospital and Nepal Police School; promoting recruitment of female officers; introducing separate uniform for traffic officers; and publishing police bulletins, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2014/03/26/news/ex-igp-lama-passes-away/260898.html | title = Ex-IGP Lama passes away}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest in 1987==

In [[sociology]] and [[political studies]], '''diversity''' is the degree of differences in identifying features among the members of a purposefully defined group, such as any group differences in racial or [[ethnic group|ethnic classifications]], age, [[gender]], [[religion]], philosophy, [[disability|physical abilities]], [[socioeconomic]] background, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[intelligence]], [[mental health]], physical [[health]], [[Genetics|genetic]] attributes, [[personality]], [[behavior]] or [[attractiveness]].

When measuring human diversity, a [[diversity index]] exemplifies the likelihood that two randomly selected residents have different ethnicities. If all residents are of the same ethnic group it's zero by definition. If half are from one group and half from another, it is .50. The diversity index does not take into account the willingness of individuals to cooperate with those of other ethnicities. &lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/diversity/neighborhood/list/ "Mapping L.A..," ''Los Angeles Times'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International human rights==
The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] affirms to "respect difference and acceptance of persons with disabilities as human diversity and [[human nature|humanity]]" for protection of human rights of persons with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], Article 3 "General Principles", (c)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
{{Main|New Left|Multiculturalism}}
Political [[creed]]s which support the idea that diversity is valuable and desirable hold that recognizing and promoting these diverse cultures may aid [[communication]] between people of different backgrounds and lifestyles, leading to greater knowledge, understanding, and peaceful coexistence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} For example, "Respect for Diversity" is one of the six principles of the [[Global Greens Charter]], a [[manifesto]] subscribed to by [[Green party|Green parties]] from all over the world. In contrast to diversity, some political creeds promote [[cultural assimilation]] as the process to lead to these ends.

===Use in American academia===
This use of ''diversity'' in this sense also extends to American [[academia]], where in an attempt to create a "diverse student body" typically supports the [[recruitment]] of [[students]] from historically excluded populations, such as students of [[African-American]] or [[Latino]] background as well as women in such historically underrepresented fields as the [[sciences]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3068">The '''Dubai International Food Safety Conference''' ('''DIFSC''') is an annual conference organized by the [[Dubai Municipality]], in conjunction with the Gulfood Exhibition, held at the [[Dubai International Convention Centre]] in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]].

==Aim==

The conference aims at providing delegates with a good understanding of current [[food safety]] issues, Food Safety Management Techniques and the [[best practice]]s followed in the [[food industry]]. The main objective of the conference is to act as a platform to resolve food safety issues in the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Co-operation Council]] region and provide opportunities for students to learn about food safety.

==1st DIFSC (2006)==

The 1st Dubai  International Food Safety Conference was introduced during the Gulfood Exhibition 2006, as part of the Dubai Municipality’s Strategic Plan, which called for enhancing the public’s health through ensuring food safety.  As food safety requires inputs from all concerned parties, the Food Control Section of Dubai Municipality teamed up with many international, regional, and local bodies in order to organize a conference that would serve as a forum for discussing issues related to the safety of food.

The three-day conference attracted more than 250 delegates from different sectors of the food industry as well as international, regional and local food control entities.

==2nd DIFSC (2007)==
The second conference was held during February 20–22, 2007 and was themed "Latest Trends in Food Safety and Risk Assessment".

The conference featured speakers representing food control authorities, International Organizations such as the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[Codex Alimentarius|Codex Alimentarius Commission]], academic and scientific circles, food manufacturing and trading companies and many other entities which are concerned with the safety of food.

Food Risk Assessment was discussed in light of the following elements:

* Food safety laws and regulations 
* Food safety systems 
* Best practices in food safety

==3rd DIFSC (2008)==
The 3rd conference was held from February 24–27, 2008.

A unique feature of the conference was the ''Tackle the Issue'' program, which aimed to bring the food industry personnel and food regulatory authorities from all the GCC countries together on one platform to look at possible solutions for problems faced by the food industry.

The '''Fabric of Security''' , also known as ''Cyber Security Fabric'' or ''Federated Security'', refers to systems designed to protect the Information Systems infrastructure of the home, a corporation or government from malicious attackers. Protection in this sense means, guaranteeing the confidentiality, integrity, and the availability of the information stored in the system ("SYSTEM"), and its elements or components.

Unlike [[endpoint security]], [[network security]], [[web application security]], and [[Internet security]], Fabric of Security Systems assume that attacks will be successful, and cannot be averted. Therefore, the emphasis shifts from attempting to prevent unauthorized access to that of minimizing the time to detect the unauthorized access, the time to isolate the unauthorized access from doing harm, and finally, the time to remove the offending process and reconfiguration of the system back into a "SAFE" state.

==Security essentials==

Security refers to processes and systems designed to protect the assets of an individual, system and/or organization from harm. Computer Security (aka, cyber security) refers to processes and systems designed to protect computer and/or information system assets from harm. In general, such assets are: (1) information/ data, (2) programs and applications, and (3) services. Protecting assets from harm means:

Confidentiality – assets are used/access only by authorized parties (also refer to as secrecy or privacy)

Integrity – assets can be modified only by authorized parties and only in authorize ways (“insider threat”)

Availability – assets are available to authorize parties at time to.

===Lampson's Protection Model===

In 1971 Butler Lampson in his now classical paper Protection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lampson|first1=Butler|title=Protection|journal=Proc. 5th Princeton Conf. on Information Sciences and Systems|date=1971|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the general model of protection of computer or information system assets which has withstood the passage of time. By enlarge, all protection systems implemented to date follow Lampson's original formulation shown here in Figure 1 entitled "Access Control Model of Protection". Fundamentally the universe is divided into two classes Principals, who access Resources. A Resource is an object for which a protection policy has been established. Access to Objects is restricted via a protection system, called a reference monitor, that implements the protection policies of the system. Namely the reference monitor or "Guard System" must: (1) identifies the identity of the Principal claiming access to an object - Principal is who are you?, (2) authentication - validates that the Principal claiming access to an object is who he/she/it claims to be - are you who you say you are?, and (3) authorization - is the principal claiming access to an object authorized to access said object.

==Fabric of security principles and architecture==
In the past, the protection model that most organizations applied to protect their infrastructure was simply the "Everything but the Kitchen Sink" model—meaning, add devices that protect the enterprise network perimeter (Trusted Zone), add devices that protect your mobile device, add devices that protect your database. In essence, this model simply advocated for the accumulation of security devices. As we pointed out earlier, see section 1.0, this model has failed.

In addition, the idea that cyber-attacks can be stopped at the periphery of the network has become a fool's errand. In today's Circa 2020 computing environment and cyber-threat landscape, individuals as well as corporations have recognized the fact that (i) threats are often distributed in nature both in time and space, making detection extremely difficult, and (ii) the working assumption is not that you can prevent infections (the goal of 100% prevention is no longer practical), but rather, given that your "system" will be compromised, how quickly can you detect the breach and how do you minimize the impact of such an event? In the future, the basis of competition for security products and services will be the ability to provide early warnings and execute countermeasures that minimize damage from cyber-attackers. The problem is not about single or even multiple independent security devices each providing some amount of absolute protection.  Rather, information from all your security products and services need to be correlated, scrutinized and transformed into wide-angle actionable information in order to minimize the most likely threats of damage by cyber-attackers in your specific enterprise environment, see Figure 3. We call this approach the “Fabric of Security.” It is a layered model that easily accommodates distributed deployment of security in multi-vendor environments.

===FOSA Architecture===

In 2013, the Wireless Systems Security Research Laboratory (WSSRL) started the development of a first-reference implementation of the Fabric of Security called FOSA. The purpose of FOSA was to use proven techniques from the areas of distributed processing, computer architecture and clustering algorithms, to build a viable, real-time security system capable of protecting the corporate infrastructure of the Circa 2020 computing model. FOSA was intended to be the first implementation of the Fabric of Security architecture, while at the same time remedying some of the limitations of current security system implementations. Specifically, the stated goal for the design was to avoid stand-alone solutions while incorporating the ability to deal with reliability issues, meaning, the best security product/solution is no good if either it fails to operate as specified (Fault Tolerant) and/or is compromised by the attacker (Resilient to Attacks). It must be able to withstand attacks directly against itself, and be able to protect itself from being compromised or disabled.

====Description of the FOSA Architecture====

In this section, we provide a brief overview of the FOSA system and its major components. However, in this manuscript we will not cover the reliability and adaptability elements of the architecture, and the use of Byzantine Agreement, see  [4],  to build resiliency into the system.

[[File:FOC-Layered-Architecture-02.png|thumbnail|Fabric Of Security Architectural Layers]]
[[File:Fabric Of Security Aechitecture (FOSA).jpg|thumbnail|Fabric of Security  Architecture]]

The architecture of FOSA is shown here in Figure 4. FOSA is a distributed system based on layer component architecture. In each FOSA node, a set of components in a hierarchical structure provide the traditional security functions found in most implementations. At the lowest level of the hierarchy, Layer0, we find the traditional data gathering component or SENSORS/Probes. Unlike other systems, SENSORS in FOSA can be custom data collectors or simply gather data from other security systems, such as FIREWALLS, and AV systems. In the latter case, SENSORS gather the data by monitoring the output of a variety of systems outputs, such as Snort, and the syslog file on  Linux. The data collected by the SENSORS serve as input to the next layer in the hierarchy, Layer1, the S-Event Generator or SEG. The SEGs function as a data abstraction layer. They collect the data from the SENSORS, filter it, convert it into a platform independent format, and provide the aggregated, filtered data to the next layer of the hierarchy, the Secure Host Manager or SHM in the form of events. The events are queued for further analysis by the SHM. In addition to this, the SEGs start and stop the SENSORS. In this context, the SHM can be consider as the local IDS/IPS that makes decisions about all activities that it monitors both host- or network-based. A critical component of the SHM is the Analysis Engine AE. The AE retrieves events from the Event Queue, processes them, and makes a final determination as to the probability that a successful attack will be launched, and/or an attack is in progress at the local level. This probability falls into one of three ranges. These are:

0 ≤ p{Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } ≤ Φ1 - No ATTACK&lt;br&gt;
Φ1 ≤ p{ Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } ≤ Φ2 - There is insufficient data at the local level to make a decision. In addition, in some situations this is an indication that the local node has been compromised.&lt;br&gt;
Φ2 ≤ p { Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } - ATTACK  detected

In the first case, the SHM is sure that the events processed do not represent an attack or elements of an Attack, and therefore the system continues operation without further actions. However, in the next two cases a potential attack has taken place or is in progress. In such a case, the SHM immediately initiates countermeasures. The first of which is to stop all further processing of events, disable all remote access to the node, and notify the next level of the hierarchy, the Distributed Threat Intelligence Manager/Engine (DTIM), that a potential failure or attack is in the making. Further, in the case that the SHM is sure the host has been compromised, then, the SHM also sends a “last gasp” message to the DTIM. Once it sends the “last gasp” message, the SHM stops the SEGs, stops processing data from the SEGs and launches countermeasures to restore the node to a healthy state.

2.1.2	Distributed Threat Intelligence Manager/Engine (DTIM)

As previously mentioned, FOSA is a real-time, distributed system based on the concept of autonomous agents. Its structure is similar to the architecture proposed in the AAFID system. However, it differs from it in at least three significant ways. These are:

# It is fault resilient. It can protect itself from traditional hardware and software failures, as well as malicious attacks.
# It has a learning engine capable of integrating new knowledge into its decision matrix.
# Attack Detection/ Prevention occurs at two levels. At the local level, SHM represents the traditional IDS/IPS system. However, decisions that affect   the health of the entire system, or decisions concerning a distributed attack, are made by correlating information among all security devices in the system using a Byzantine Agreement Protocols or BAP.

In the architecture, the Distributed Threat Intelligence Engine/Manager (DTIM) consists of two major components: (1) the Distributed Trust Manager (DTM) which performs the critical functions of Fault Tolerance and Attack Resilience, and (2) the Distributed Threat Intelligence Correlation Engine (TICE) that performs the function of Threat and Event detection globally.

2.1.2.1	Distributed Trust Manager (DTM)

The DTM performs several essential functions. These are:

* Formation and maintenance of a “Trust Domain”(TD). The TD is a network of trusted security devices that have been deemed “safe.” Roughly, “safe” means that all nodes are running the same/latest revision of software and hardware, they have not been compromised and they have obtained a unique identifier or token certifying their identity to the Trust Domain
* Delivery of a “last gasp” message to other nodes in the TD
* Using Byzantine Agreement, and upon receipt of a “last gasp” message, the DTM initiates the determination as to the presence or absence of an attack/intrusion;
* In the case that an attack/intrusion has been confirmed, the DTIM is responsible for removing the offending node from the TD, issuing the necessary countermeasures and  re-constituting the TD with the remaining nodes in the system
* Finally, the DTM prevents the Trust Domain from being partitioned.

The creation of a Trust Domain and the formation of an initial group have been discussed in a previous work, see [2] in detail. However, because   nodes can be compromised and their status can change over time, the DTIM must have the capability of expelling members and reconfiguring itself. This process of reconfiguration is initiated by either the receipt of a “last gasp” message from a member or when the DTM reconfiguration timer expires. The basic process works as follows. Upon receipt of a “last gasp” message, every node in the Trust Domain will initiate the reconfiguration by:
•	Sending a set of test patterns to the node suspected of being compromised. The test pattern matrix consists of a set of known intrusion vectors, as well as a set of non-intrusion patterns. Upon formation of the initial group, and every time that membership in the Trusted Domain changes, the matrix is reconstituted and distributed among all members. The matrix is distributed in such a way that no single member group of members colluding (as long as k, k N-1)/ 2; where k is number of colluding members), has complete knowledge of all test patterns
* Each member of the TD will record its opinion of the suspected node based on answers received
* All members of the Trust Domain, except for the suspected node, initiate the BAP, and arrive at a consensus as the status of the suspected node
* Based on the consensus decision, the necessary countermeasures will be invoked, and the offending node isolated for either manual or automatic repair

2.1.2.2 	Distributed Trust Manager component of the DTIM in FOSA- An Abstract Model

One of the key components of the Distributed Threat Intelligence Manager/Engine is the Distributed Trust manager of DTM. The DTM is built upon the principles of replication, consensus, and the ”wisdom of crowds.” In order to understand the behaviors of the FOSA system, it is important that an abstract model of the Trust Domain (TD) is presented. Here we present such a model. Let M = {C, Cnew, P, X, α}, be an abstract representation for a Trust Domain. This model allows us to reason as to the correctness of the DTM component of the Threat Intelligence/Engine. One potential side benefit of the model is that it will allow us to identify holes in our  design. The basic components of the model, C, P, X, and α are defined below.
C = {c1, c2, c3, ..., cn}, for some finite integer n, is the set of nodes in the Trust Domain. A node within this context is any Security Device that is collecting data and making decisions about the possibility of an attack. While n could be very large, for practical purposes associated with the implementation of DTM, we limit n to 16.

cnew = cj |cj ∈/ C, which is a node that is trying to join a Trust Domain. The state, w, of cnew is unknown at the time that cnew declares its intention to join a Trust Domain. That is, cnew may be a node whose behavior is in accordance with the Trust Domain admission and security policies (“uncompromised node”) or it may be compromised.

α = {α1, α2, α3, ..., αm} is the set of actions that a node may perform. A node is essentially a deterministic finite automaton. Thus, it has a finite set of states, a finite set of input symbols and a transition function [3]. The transition function is analogous to the set of actions a node may take based on the input the node receives. Since the input alphabet is finite and the number of states is finite, the set of actions, α, which a node may take, is finite.

P = {p1, p2, p3, ..., pk} is a security policy which describes the acceptable behaviors of a Security Device in the Trust Domain. Each pi is a rule composed of a subject, an object and an action that the subject may perform on the object. We note that security policies are rarely defined completely, as it is difficult to list every possible rule that is acceptable. Thus, we accept that we will have to add new rules to the policy as new acceptable actions that a node may perform on an object are discovered. It should be clear that P ⊆ α. We also note that ¬P ∪ P = α.

X is a capability matrix, which indicates what actions the subjects can perform on the objects and/or on each other. The subjects here are the nodes. The objects are the data and the services running on the nodes. Xij represents all the actions that subject subjecti can perform on object objectj . In other words, for each object oj on computer nodek, Xij gives the set of actions, αl ∈ α that computer nodek can execute on behalf of subjecti on object 0j .

Using this model, we defined a capability and policy matrix for our experimental Trust Domain, see Figure 5, with corresponding security policy P  ={p1, p2, p3, ..., pk } below.

2.1.2.3		Security Policy

We define several variables and constants that are necessary to define the security policy, P. The variables are:

OSi =the current operating version on nodei
FOSAi = FOSA software version  nodei
responsei,x  = the response nodei gives to nodex in the TD when it is interrogated
opinioni,x = the belief of nodex in the TD about whether nodei is compromised	majorityi,x = the majority belief of all the nodes in the TD about whether nodei is com- promised after the parallel Signed Message Algorithm has been completed
messageTamperedi = whether messagei has been tampered with

The constants present in the security policy are:

OST  = the minimum acceptable O/S version for a node to join the TD
FOSAT  = the minimum acceptable version of the FOSA software 
responsec  = the correct response of a node to an interrogation
compromised = the majority belief that the node trying to join the TD is compromised
uncompromised= the majority belief that the node trying to join the TD is safe

Using this model, we defined a capability and policy matrix for our experimental Trust Domain, see Figure 5. The corresponding security policy P  ={p1, p2, p3, ..., pk } is defined below. Based on these definitions, the security policy can be described as follows:

p1: Given a node, ci ∈ Cnew, that is attempting to join a TD, then, if the value of OSi &lt; OST, then ci is not allowed to join TD &lt;br&gt;
p2: Given a node, ci ∈ Cnew, that is attempting to join a TD, then, if the value of SAFEi &lt; SAFET, then ci is not allowed to join TD &lt;br&gt;
p3: Given a node, ci ∈ Cnew, that is attempting to join a TD, and a node cx in the TD, then, if the value of responsei,x  = responsec,  then opinioni,x  = compromised &lt;br&gt;
p4: Given a node, ci ∈ Cnew, that is attempting to join a TD, and a node cx in the TD, then, if the value of responsei,x = responsec, then opinioni,x = uncompromised &lt;br&gt;
p5: Given a set of nodes, c1, ..., cx, in a TD, a node ci not in TD, and a majorityi,x = compromised, then, cx does not open a socket connection to ci (preventing ci to join TD). &lt;br&gt;
p6: Given a set of nodes, c1, ..., cx, in a TD, a node ci not in TD, and a majorityi,x = uncompromised, then, cx opens a socket connection to ci (thus allowing ci is to join TD). &lt;br&gt;
p7: Given nodes cx and  cy  are  nodes  in  a TD, and cx receives messagei from cy, such that messageTamperedi = T rue, then, cx discards messagei as if it was never received.

2.1.3 	Threat Intelligence Correlation Engine (TICE)

TICE or the Threat Intelligence Correlation Engine is a global engine whose inputs are the events generated by the SHM module at a lower level of the hierarchy, local information as to the configuration of the environment under protection, global information as to the current threat level in the particular region and the corresponding and pertinent threat landscape at the time of the events. The output of TICE is threat evaluations, actionable intelligence, and threat countermeasure recommendations. Similar to its lower level counterparts at Layer2 - the SHM, TICE evaluates &amp; correlates events and ascertains the correlation of such events into three distinct possibilities:

0 ≤ p{Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } ≤ Φ1 - No ATTACK/Intrusion

Φ1 ≤ p{ Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } ≤ Φ2 - Insufficient Data

Φ2 ≤ p { Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } - Attack/ Intrusion present
The values of  Φ1 and Φ2 are tunable.

2.1.4 	Logging and Presentation Services - Issuance of Countermeasures (LAPIS)

LAPIS represents the top layer of the architecture, and it is the module where actionable intelligence is presented to an administrator for further action and/or where automatic countermeasures are issued throughout the protected environment. 
In the simplest implementation of the FOSA architecture, LATIS is the equivalent of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) module. It provides visual information to the security officer/administrator as to the state, real time threats that have been detected and the overall integrity of the protected environment.

Typical SIEM capabilities such as: (1) Security Event Management (SEM), (2) File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), (3) Configuration Management Database (CMDB), and (4) Availability and Performance Monitoring (APM) are part of this layer.
However, unlike your typical SIEM, the LAPIS layer provides for automatic countermeasure generation, repair and recovery, as well as manual mode where forensics and countermeasure issuance is based on a probabilistic model with tunable Φ1 and Φ2 parameters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15175">The '''Family Movement''',&lt;ref name="FM"/&gt; also known in the past as the '''Parent Movement''', is an arm of the disability rights movement, a larger [[social movement]].  The Family Movement advocates for the economic and [[social rights]] of family members with a [[disability]].  Key elements include: [[social inclusion]]; active participation; a life of meaning; [[safety]]; [[economic security]]; [[accessibility]] and [[self-determination]].  The family movement has been critical in closing institutions and other segregated facilities; promoting [[inclusive education]]; reforming adult guardianship to the current supported decisionmaking; increasing access to [[health care]]; developing real jobs; fighting [[stereotype]]s and reducing [[discrimination]].

==The Parent/Family Arm of the Disability Movement==
In the late 1940s and early 1950s families spontaneously across [[Canada]], the US,{{sfn|MGCDD}} [[England]], [[France]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] began asserting a different vision, a different lifestyle and a different future for their sons and daughters with [[intellectual disabilities]], [[mental handicap]]s and [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]].  These isolated, independent developments eventually coalesced into the first wave of the 'parent movement'.  They organized and demanded services for their sons and daughters. Their efforts eventually resulted in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, December 9, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=December 9, 1975 |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/ |title=UN Charter of Human Rights for the Mentally Retarded |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: while this terminology is not used today it was the commonly accepted terminology 6 or 7 decades ago.)  This has subsequently been eclipsed by the UN [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] which was equally influenced by the emerging and now very strong consumer '[[independent living]]' arm of the disability movement.

In those early formative days families around the world began to question the accepted wisdom that they should institutionalize their son or daughter with a disability.&lt;ref&gt;NPR: A Mental Ward Exposed , Credit: Photos: Charles Lord; Producers: Maggie Starbard, Kathleen Masterson, Katie Hayes; Reporter: Joseph Shapiro; Editor: Vikki Valentine&amp;nbsp;– https://openlibrary.org/b/OL23079739M/Acts_of_conscience&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acts of Conscience:World War II, mental institutions, and religious objectors by Steven J. Taylor Published in 2009, Syracuse University Press (Syracuse, N.Y)  &amp;nbsp;– https://openlibrary.org/b/OL23079739M/Acts_of_conscience&lt;/ref&gt;  But parents were isolated from each other. They had no way of knowing who else felt the same way. It was not easy for parents to get to know each other. Some resorted to placing ads in newspapers. Even here they faced challenges as some newspapers felt it was inappropriate to advertise the fact you had a child with a disability.  It is hard to understand today but this was the accepted wisdom of the time.

As they started coming together families began to create opportunities, programs and supports for their sons and daughters. They created programs with few resources. Taking over church basements to set up schools; borrowing [[chalk]], discarded books from [[school board]]s who would not accept educational responsibility for educating their sons and daughters.

These parents and their community supporters formed the Associations for Retarded Children.  These organizations are now called Associations for Community Living in Canada.{{sfn|Stainton|2006|pp=135–145}} Following their example organizations for people with cerebral palsy (concurrent time period of the Arc), hearing and visual impairments, autism and other handicapping conditions were started. Parents were also involved as parent-professional partners at university centers, and were given additional funds to begin cross-disability offices, and even family support agencies with preferential hiring practices.

Three famous Americans (two parents and one brother) had a major impact on public perceptions of disability in the 1950s and 1960s. One was [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Pearl Buck]] who wrote about her daughter Carol in the book ''[[The Child Who Never Grew]]''.  The other was [[Dale Evans]] who starred with her husband [[Roy Rogers]] in a popular television western wrote ''[[Angel Unaware]]'' about her daughter with [[Down Syndrome]]. The third was President [[John F. Kennedy]], whose sister Rosemary had a mental handicap. In 1961 he launched the [[President's Panel on Mental Retardation]] which became the [[President's Committee on Mental Retardation]]. These three combined with the work of parents and family members brought the issue out of the closet, eased the stigma of having a child with a disability and became a major source of hope for families.{{sfn|MGCDD}}

In 1961 the [[International League of Societies for the Mentally Handicapped]] was formed. This organization is now called [[Inclusion International]].

The UN [[Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons]] was adopted by the [[United Nations]] General Assembly on December 9, 1975.

One of the most important contributions to the parent/family movement was the introduction of the concept of Normalization (people with disabilities).  Originating in [[Denmark]] with [[Erik Bank-Mikkelsen]] and [[Bengt Nirjeit]] normalization principles were adapted in North America by [[Wolf Wolfensberger]]. Dr. Wolfensberger fully supported families, and to some extent, parental control in decisionmaking. Wolfensberger wrote his seminal work in [[Toronto]] in the early 1970s as a visiting scholar to the [[Canadian Association for the Mentally Retarded]] and the [[National Institute on Mental Retardation]]&amp;nbsp;– the national bodies for the local parent founded organizations.  Wolfensberger's theory is now called [[Social Role Valorisation]].

Eventually with persistence, patience and ingenuity the government funded system of social, educational and health programs and services took shape.

By the 1980s the parent/family movement had successfully established a comprehensive program and service infrastructure which was court-mandated in some states and developed through major state and regional governmental offices. It was natural for them to support their sons and daughters who were creating their own movements, including the [[Independent Living]] movement which had strong roots in the 1970s laws (e.g., Rehabilitation Act of 1973) and [[self-advocacy]] movement which obtained university parent-professional support in its inception.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9603">The 23 February 2005 '''French law on colonialism''' ({{Lang-fr|loi n° 2005-158 du 23 février 2005 portant reconnaissance de la Nation et contribution nationale en faveur des Français rapatriés}}, "Law No. 2005-158 of 23 February 2005 regarding recognition of the Nation and national contribution in favour of the French repatriates") was an act passed by the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], which imposed on [[Secondary education in France|high-school (''lycée'')]] teachers a requirement to teach the "positive values" of [[colonialism]] to their students (Article 4, Paragraph 2). The law, particularly the aforementioned paragraph and Articles 1 and 13, created a public uproar and drew massive opposition from the [[left-wing|left]], and Article 4, Paragraph 2 was repealed by president [[Jacques Chirac]] (UMP) at the beginning of 2006, after accusations of [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]] from various teachers and historians, including [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]], [[Claude Liauzu]], [[Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison]] and [[Benjamin Stora]]. Its Article 13 was also criticized as it supported former [[Organisation armée secrète]] (OAS) militants. 

==Context==

At the end of [[Algerian War]], upon independence in 1962, 900,000 European-Algerians (''{{lang|fr|[[Pieds-noirs]]}}'') fled to France within a few months in fear of the FLN's revenge. The French government was totally unprepared for the vast number of refugees, which caused turmoil in France. The majority of Algerian Muslims who had worked for the French were disarmed and left behind as the [[Évian Accords|treaty]] between French and Algerian authorities declared that no actions could be taken against them.&lt;ref&gt;Évian accords, Chapitre II, partie A, article 2&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Harki]]s in particular, having served as auxiliaries with the French army, were regarded as traitors by the FLN and between 50,000 and 150,000 Harkis and family members were murdered by the FLN or by lynch-mobs, often after being abducted and tortured.{{Dubious | New research suggests that the number is much less than 150,000. See http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/05/qa-happened-algeria-harkis-150531082955192.html and Pierre Daum's "The Last Taboo: Harkis Who Stayed in Algeria After 1962".|date=November 2017}} About 91,000 managed to flee to France,{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} some with help from their French officers acting against orders, and {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} they and their descendants form a significant part of the Algerian-French population.

== Article 4 on the "positive role of the French presence abroad" ==
The controversial Article 4 asked teachers and textbooks to "acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite French law|number or usual name=no 2005-158|date in French=23 février 2005|full name=portant reconnaissance de la Nation et contribution nationale en faveur des Français rapatriés |language=French |URL=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000444898&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was considered by the left-wing and many in the former colonies as a denial of the problems of colonialism. There was rising antagonism both nationally and internationally until the law was repealed at the start of 2006. [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], president of [[Algeria]], refused to sign the envisioned "friendly treaty" with France because of this law. On 26 June 2005, he declared that the law "...approached mental blindness, negationism and revisionism."&lt;ref&gt;

The latter cancelled his visit to the [[overseas department]] of [[Martinique]], where a thousand people demonstrated against him in [[Fort-de-France]]. Sarkozy was elected president in 2007.

UMP deputy [[Christian Vanneste]] was criticized for having introduced the expression ''"rôle positif"'' French for "positive values" in the text. On 25 April 2005, more than a thousand professors and thesis students had signed the petition "Colonisation: No to the teaching of an official history". MP [[Christiane Taubira]] called the law "disastrous" and enacted because of [[lobbying]] from the [[harki]]s and the [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]], remaining silent on the ''Indigenate Code'' or [[forced labour]] in the [[French colonial empire|former colonies]].

== Partial repeal ==
Supporters of the law were decried as a resurgence of the "colonial lobby", a term used in late 19th-century France to label people (deputies, scientists, businessmen, etc.) who supported French colonialism. In defiance of this revisionism, Chirac finally turned against his own UMP majority that had voted for the law, and declared:"In a Republic, there is no official history. Writing history is the business of historians: it should not be circumscribed by laws."&lt;ref&gt;"History should not be written by law" says Jacques Chirac (''Ce n'est pas à la loi d'écrire l'histoire''), quoted by [[Radio France|RFI]], December 11, 2005: [http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/072/article_40372.asp] {{fr icon}} &lt;/ref&gt; He passed a [[decree]] charging the president of the Assembly, [[Jean-Louis Debré]] (UMP), with modifying the controversial law, to take out the revisionist article. In order to do so, Chirac ordered Prime minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] to refer the matter to the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], hoping the decision would allow such a decree to repeal the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Chirac revient sur le 'rôle positif' de la colonisation | publisher=[[Radio France International|RFI]] | date=2006-01-26 | url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/073/article_41417.asp|language=fr}} &lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Council indeed decreed that the regulation of history textbooks is an administrative matter, not a legal one, and as such, the contested amendment was repealed at the beginning of 2006.

== History and the law ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2017}}
In a tribune ''Liberty for History'', 19 historians (including [[Élisabeth Badinter]], [[Alain Decaux]] and [[Marc Ferro]]) demanded the repeal of all "historic laws": not only the 23 February 2005 Act, but also the 1990 [[Gayssot Act]] against "racism, xenophobia and historical revisionism", the [[Taubira Act]] on the recognition of [[slavery]] as a "[[crime against humanity]]", and the law recognizing the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Historians found this demand controversial. While many agreed that the state should not be determining history, few believed that the previous acts had to be repealed. Some opposed the Gayssot Act and other laws, but thought repealing them would be perceived as a kind of condemnation of the ideas.

The debate on the 23 February 2005 law was linked to a wider debate in France concerning colonialism and current issues of [[immigration]]. As the historian [[Benjamin Stora]] pointed out, people interested in colonialism have a major "memory" stake in influencing the way various communities and the nation represent themselves. Official state histories generally have a hard time accepting the existence of past crimes and errors. The [[Algerian war of independence]] (1954–62), characterized at the time by the French government as a "public order operation," was only recognized as a "war" in 1999 by the French National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|trans-title=Colonialism: A Dangerous War of Memories Begin (by Benjamin Stora) |work=[[L'Humanité]] |publication-date=2005-12-06 |date=January 17, 2006 |title=Début d’une dangereuse guerre des mémoires |url=http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/article48.html?var_recherche=stora |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113211509/http://www.humanite.fr/journal/2005-12-06/2005-12-06-819358 |archive-date=2007-01-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=At war with France's past |author=[[Claude Liauzu]] | work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] | date=June 2005 | url=http://mondediplo.com/2005/06/19colonisation}}  &lt;/ref&gt; In the same sense, philosopher [[Paul Ricœur]] (1981) has said that there has to be a "[[decolonization]] of memory", because mentalities themselves have been colonized during the "[[Age of Imperialism]]."{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The '''imperial hunt of the Qing dynasty''' was an annual rite of the [[emperor of China|emperors]] of [[China]] during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911). It was first organized in 1681 by the [[Kangxi Emperor]] at the imperial hunting grounds at Mulan (modern-day [[Weichang Manchu and Mongol Autonomous County]], near what would become the [[Chengde Mountain Resort|summer residence]] of the Qing emperors at [[Chengde]]. Starting in 1683 the event was held annually at Mulan during the autumn, lasting up to a month. The Qing dynasty hunt was a synthesis of earlier Chinese and [[Inner Asia]]n hunting traditions, particularly those of the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] and [[Mongols]]. The emperor himself participated in the hunt, along with thousands of soldiers, imperial family members, and government officials.

The Manchu emperors of the Qing dynasty used the hunt as a military exercise to train their troops in the traditional martial skills of archery and horsemanship. The hunt was also a bonding ritual intended to emphasize the shared Inner Asian martial traditions of the Manchu and Mongol soldiers of the [[Eight Banners]] who were selected to participate ([[Han Chinese]] troops were excluded from the hunt).{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=335}} The event provided an opportunity for Qing emperors to leave the confines of the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]] and return to the forests "north of the [[Great Wall of China|wall]]", closer to their ancestral homelands, where they could hunt and live as their ancestors did. As the Manchus grew accustomed to living in Chinese cities, Qing emperors expanded and ritualized the imperial hunt as a sort of [[invented tradition]], using it to preserve the traditional Manchu way of life. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] made it a key element of his effort to halt the steady decline of military discipline within the [[Eight Banners]] during his reign.

Each year, for the duration of the hunt, Mulan served as a temporary capital and a venue for diplomatic activities. The Qianlong Emperor required the leaders of Inner Asian [[tributary state]]s to join in the hunt on a rotating basis, and he frequently received foreign emissaries there rather than in the imperial palace at Beijing.{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|pp=83–84}} To facilitate the continued operation of the imperial government in the emperor's absence, many government officials accompanied the emperor to Mulan, where they lived and worked in a tent city replicating the layout of the Forbidden City, exchanging correspondence regularly with Beijing and Chengde.

Altogether, the Kangxi, Qianlong, and [[Jiaqing Emperor|Jiaqing]] Emperors participated in 91 hunts during their reigns.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|p=72}} As an important element of Qing military culture, and an embodiment of Manchu identity, the Qing imperial hunt featured regularly in the official artwork and poetry of the Qing dynasty. It was the subject of several paintings by [[Giuseppe Castiglione (Jesuit)|Giuseppe Castiglione]], the Italian Jesuit who served as a court painter to Qianlong. Images of the hunt, much like images commemorating victories in battle and other military subjects, were regularly commissioned by the imperial court as a form of propaganda, portraying Qing emperors as exemplars of traditional martial (''wu'') values.

==Origins==

===Chinese===
Hunting has been an important element of Chinese elite identity since at least the [[Zhou dynasty]]. Hunting, [[warfare]], and [[animal sacrifice]] were intimately linked in the culture of the Zhou aristocracy.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=17–18}} As Chinese society became progressively more [[agrarian society|agrarian]], hunting was transformed into a ritual activity associated with the elite. Because the [[bow and arrow]] were used both for hunting and for waging war, the practice of [[archery]] became a defining trait of the proper gentleman of the Zhou period.{{sfn|Lorge|2012|p=17}} A common theme throughout Chinese history is the juxtaposition of hunting and warfare. As one Zhou dynasty writer put it:
:Therefore one uses the spring hunt, the [[summer]] hunt, the autumn hunt, and the [[winter]] hunt, all in the intervals between agricultural labor, to practice the [great] services. Every three years there should be a review of the troops... The lord does not shoot any bird or beast whose flesh is not offered in the sacrificial pots or whose hide, teeth, bones, horns, fur, or feathers are not used on the sacrificial vessels.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=17–18}}

In the classic 14th century novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]] [[Cao Cao]] of the [[Han dynasty]] states: "The kings and emperors of ancient times held four grand hunts yearly, riding forth from the capital each season to show the world their prowess."{{sfn|Luo|2011|p=246}} These four seasonal hunts were the spring hunt ({{zh|c=春蒐|p=chūnsōu}}), summer hunt ({{zh|c=夏苗|p=xiàmiáo}}), autumn hunt, and winter hunt ({{zh|c=冬狩|p=dōngshòu}}).{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|p=81}} Such ritual hunts were regular events in the [[Tang dynasty]], and were sometimes criticized for their extravagance.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=67–68}} Emperors, however, saw hunting as an important military exercise. [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] defended his frequent hunting, saying: "At present the empire is without trouble, but military preparations cannot be forgotten."{{sfn|Chen|2010|pp=35–36}}

[[File:KhubilaiOnTheHunt.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Kublai Khan]] out hunting]]

===Inner Asian===
Although it was known by the same Chinese name (''qiuxian'') as the autumn hunts of Chinese antiquity, the autumn hunt of the Qing dynasty was more directly influenced by the hunting practices of the Inner Asian horse cultures. The Manchus who conquered the [[Ming dynasty]] and founded the Qing were themselves part of that tradition. The Qing empire encompassed not only Manchus but also Mongols, [[Turkic peoples]], and other [[nomadic pastoralism|steppe nomads]]. Like the Mongols of the [[Yuan dynasty]] and the [[Khitan people|Khitans]] of the [[Liao dynasty]], the Manchus of the Qing practiced a form of ''[[wikt:battue|battue]]'' hunting, in which groups of soldiers would encircle a large area of forest and drive their prey into clearings where they could be shot.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=67–68}} This style of hunting was called ''aba'' in Manchu.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=184}}

As recorded by [[Marco Polo]], [[Kublai Khan]] had a hunting preserve near his summer capital at Xanadu ([[Shangdu]]). The khan hunted there regularly during his reign.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=71–72}} Mongol and Khitan [[khan (title)|khans]] considered hunting an important form of military training, and practiced it regularly. For steppe nomads like themselves, hunting was still an important part of daily life, and not just an idle pursuit of the upper classes as it had become among the Han Chinese. [[Emperor Taizong of Liao|Emperor Taizong]] of the Khitan Liao dynasty echoed Emperor Taizong of Tang when he remarked, "Our hunting is not merely the pursuit of enjoyment, but a means of practicing warfare!"{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=67–68}}

The [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], ancestors of the Manchus, organized their military units along the same lines as their hunting parties. This practice was carried on by the Manchus. From these units emerged the companies, called ''niru'' ("arrow"), that formed the basic building blocks of the [[Eight Banners]] military system that went on to conquer China.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=67–68}} The pre-[[Qing conquest of China|conquest]] Manchus participated frequently in organized hunts. In 1630, before the capture of Beijing, [[Hong Taiji]] established a hunting ground near the old Qing capital of Mukden ([[Shenyang]]).{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|p=69}} However, it was his grandson the Kangxi Emperor who would start the tradition of regular annual hunts.

==The Mulan hunting preserve==
[[File:Inner Mongolia grassland (2005).jpg|thumb|320px|Saihanba National Forest Park, which encompasses part of the old hunting grounds]]

===Establishment===
The tradition of hunting at Mulan in the autumn came about as the result of Kangxi's 1681 hunting expedition in lands belonging to his Mongol allies, near the site of the former Yuan capital Shangdu. These lands were gifted to Kangxi at the end of his visit. In 1683, Kangxi returned to hunt again and the lands were established as an official hunting preserve, and bounded by a [[Willow Palisade|willow palisade]].{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=69–70}}{{sfn|Rawski|1998|pp=19–20}}

===Environment===
The hunting preserve was located in [[Rehe]] (Jehol) province, which has since been divided among the provinces of [[Hebei]], [[Liaoning]], and [[Inner Mongolia]]. It occupied a densely forested area where Mongols had hunted for generations. The area contained 67 clearings, called ''hoihan'' in Manchu, that animals could be driven into as part of the ''aba'' hunt. These clearings usually had [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] names, reflecting the area's history as a traditional Mongol hunting ground. For much of its history, it was known simply as "the hunting ground at Rehe". The Chinese name Mulan ({{zh|c=木兰|p=Mùlán}}) is a phonetic translation of the Manchu term ''muran'', which refers to a hunting method in which hunters would [[whistling|whistle]] for [[deer]], using decoy deer heads as a lure. An 1807 inscription by the Jiaqing Emperor refers to the hunting preserve as Mulan/Muran, and today the area is called Mulan Weichang ({{zh|c=木兰围场|p=Mùlán Wéichǎng}}).{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=184}}{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=71–72}} It is located in [[Weichang Manchu and Mongol Autonomous County]] in Hebei.

During the Kangxi era, plentiful game was to be found at Mulan. The emperor was able to hunt not only deer, but also [[tiger]]s, [[bear]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[wolf|wolves]]. Qing emperors enjoyed the beauty of the natural environment, and the escape it provided them from urban life in the capital. As Kangxi wrote:
:I am fine. Right now there is no business. At this cool place outside the passes, everyone, from soldiers down to errand-runners, has set up their tents. We've been living here eating game and fish from the mountains and rivers. At night I cover myself with just a cotton blanket. The rainfall has been just right. My mind and heart are tranquil.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=71–73}}

[[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]], who visited the Qianlong Emperor at Rehe in 1793 during the [[Macartney Embassy]], gave the following account of the area:
:It is one of the finest forest scenes in the world, wild, woody, mountainous and rocky, abounding with stags and deer of different species, and most of the other beasts of chace, not dangerous to man... In many places immense woods, chiefly [[oak]]s, [[pine]]s, and [[chestnut]]s, grow upon perpendicular steeps... These woods often clamber over the loftiest pinnacles of the stony hills or, gathering on the skirts of them, descend with a rapid sweep and bury themselves in the deepest vallies.

Within the preserve Macartney also found "palaces, banquetting houses, and monasteries," accessed by roads "hewn out of the living rock". From a hilltop pavilion, he saw around him "so rich, so various, so beautiful, so sublime a prospect [his] eyes had ever beheld".{{sfn|Barrow|Macartney|1807|pp=273–275}} In the later years of the Qianlong era and in the Jiaqing era, however, illegal [[poaching]] and [[logging]] in the preserve became a serious issue. Jiaqing observed in the early 1800s that the damage to the local [[ecosystem]] had made it very difficult to hunt there.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=71–73}}

===Administration===
In 1705, the Kangxi Emperor created a hunting office within the [[Eight Banners]] to manage the preserve at Mulan. The headquarters of its Chief Controller was located in Chengde. All but one of the officials who held this position were Manchus, the one exception being a Mongol. In 1749, responsibility over Mulan was given over to the [[Lifan Yuan]], which supervised the Qing dynasty's Mongolian dependencies. The Qianlong Emperor increased the number of officials at Mulan in 1753. During his reign, the number of hunting guards increased from 191 to 800. The number again increased to 950 under the Jiaqing Emperor. Hunting guards at Mulan were selected among bannermen from the capital, and were responsible for preventing poaching, squatting, and illegal logging, as well as for managing the wildlife in Mulan's sixty-seven{{sfn|Rawski|1998|p=20}} (later seventy-two) hunting zones. With few exceptions, all permanent construction was banned in the preserve. In 1764, responsibility for Mulan was given back to the [[Eight Banners]], under the lieutenant general of the Rehe garrison. Throughout its history, the administration of the Mulan preserve was staffed entirely with Manchus and Mongols.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=70–71}}

==History==

===Kangxi era===
The first hunt at Mulan was in 1681, when the Kangxi Emperor hunted there as a guest of his Mongol allies. With him on that occasion were 3,000 Mongol riders, a small number of bannermen of the [[Eight Banners]], and a retinue of officials from Beijing. After receiving the land as a gift from the Mongols, Kangxi hunted there each year starting with his second visit in 1683. Participation in the hunt was expanded to include troops from the [[Eight Banners]] of Beijing and the Banner garrisons of [[Nanjing]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Jingzhou]], and [[Xi'an]].{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=69–70}} The best archers and riders of each garrison were selected to participate, based on their performance on tests earlier in the year.{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|p=83}} Only Manchu and Mongol bannermen could be selected, reflecting the hunt's Inner Asian character.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=184}} Hunts were large-scale affairs involving thousands of participants; in addition to bannermen, there were Mongol princes and government officials present.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|p=73}} Kangxi had delicacies such as strawberries grown near the grounds so they could be enjoyed by his hunting party.{{sfn|Allsen|2011|p=49}}

The construction of the [[Chengde Mountain Resort]] in Rehe began during Kangxi's reign. The resort was established as a summer residence for the Qing emperors. Its location was north of the Great Wall, halfway between the wall and the hunting grounds at Mulan.{{sfn|Chayet|2004|pp=33–34}} Each year, the emperor would depart Chengde during the autumn and travel with his entourage to Mulan, a distance of seventy-five miles.{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|p=83-84}} Although Chengde was said to be a place to escape the heat of Beijing in the summer, in fact Kangxi usually stayed there into autumn, and sometimes returned in the winter.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|p=72}}

Except when he was away on campaign, Kangxi hunted annually at Mulan until his death in 1722.{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|p=83}} In his later years, Kangxi insisted on continuing to hunt, despite needing to be carried in a sedan chair.{{sfn|Allsen|2011|p=128}} Kangxi's son, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], never hunted at Mulan as an emperor, though he had done so as a prince. Yongzheng regretted his failure to continue the custom, and instructed his sons to maintain their hunting skills.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|p=73}}{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|p=83}}{{sfn|Elliott|2001|pp=185–186}}

===Qianlong era===
The next emperor to hunt at Mulan was Qianlong, who revived and expanded his grandfather's tradition. Mulan held deep significance for Qianlong, who erected a stele there in 1751.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|p=77}} Concerned about the disappearance of traditional Manchu ways in his generation, he wrote to one of his generals, "From the third year [of my reign] the former institution of the regular training hunt will be begun. Only then will I know whether you have truly practiced as you have preached." From the emperor's point of view, the hunt was the only way to maintain the skills of his troops at shooting from horseback.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=186}}

The Qianlong Emperor held over forty hunts in his reign,{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|p=83}} and received foreign dignitaries at Chengde when he was away from the capital. Hunts were usually cancelled in years when the emperor visited the imperial tombs at Mukden, or for important diplomatic events. The visits to Chengde of [[Amursana]] in 1754, the [[Lobsang Palden Yeshe, 6th Panchen Lama|Sixth Panchen Lama]] in 1780, and Lord Macartney in 1793 all resulted in such cancellations.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|p=82}} As a venue for such visits, Chengde's location north of the wall and its proximity to the hunting grounds emphasized the Inner Asian heritage of the Manchus and made it the ideal location to receive emissaries from the societies of [[Central Asia]].{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=184}}

===Jiaqing era===
Like his father Qianlong, the Jiaqing Emperor considered the Mulan hunt to be of vital importance. The inscription of his 1807 stele ("Record of Mulan") at the hunting preserve, placed near that of his father, stated that "Mulan is our nation's hunting ground." Jiaqing reaffirmed the hunt's importance as both a representation of Manchu identity and as a form of military training. Acknowledging that his own riding and shooting skills were probably inferior to those of his father, he proclaimed, "I surely will not take up idle, leisurely ways." In the final words of his inscription, the Jiaqing Emperor wrote:
:Can the son who is heir to the house betray the aims of his ancestors? Hunting at Muran in the autumn is the eternal way that must not be forgotten, but preserved for all time by generation after generation of sons and grandsons.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=78–79}}

Jiaqing, however, was the last emperor to hunt regularly at Mulan. His son, the [[Daoguang Emperor]], discontinued the practice after ascending the throne, and no more hunts would occur thereafter.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|p=80}}

==Events and activities==

===Journey from Beijing===
[[File:Chengde 1875-1890.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Qing dynasty map of Chengde Mountain Resort]]
In the early years of the Kangxi era, before the construction of the Chengde complex at his behest, the emperor would travel directly to Mulan in the fall.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|p=72}} Kangxi's entourage lived off the land, hunting and camping along the route to Mulan.{{sfn|Symons|2004|pp=57–60}} The emperor wrote of roasting venison over an open fire, and making tea with melted snow.{{sfn|Allsen|2011|p=120}} On his 1711 trip, after construction had begun at Chengde, it is estimated that 12,000 people may have accompanied him from the resort.{{sfn|Symons|2004|pp=57–60}} During Qianlong's reign, the emperor's usual practice was to first go to Chengde in the summer, and then proceed to the hunting grounds later in the year. Before departing for Chengde, the emperor and the imperial family would participate in ceremonies in Beijing. Tibetan [[lama]]s were present to pray for the success of the hunt.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|p=73}} The emperor would usually return to Beijing just after the end of the hunting season. The trip to Chengde from Beijing took seven days, with the emperor and his large entourage stopping at lodges stationed along the way. According to Lord Macartney, whose party took this route to reach Chengde in 1793, each day's segment of the trip was short enough to be completed by mid-day or afternoon. Macartney estimated the distance from Beijing to be about 131.5 miles.{{sfn|Symons|2004|pp=57–60}}

There were two parallel roads between Beijing and Chengde, one for the emperor and one for other authorized persons. While traveling the route, Macartney observed a large number of troops repairing the road in anticipation of the emperor's return trip to Beijing. The road was known to become muddy after heavy summer rains, as observed by the Jesuit painter [[Jean Denis Attiret]]. It crossed several rivers, at which bridges or ferries were provided. In some areas, Macartney found the road "very rough" and difficult to travel. Along the route were guard posts at approximately five mile intervals, each staffed by a handful of soldiers to provide security.{{sfn|Symons|2004|pp=57–60}}

===Hunting===
[[File:Hongli Spearing a Tiger - detail.png|thumb|271px|left|Detail from ''Hongli Spearing a Tiger'']]
Scheduled hunting activities at Mulan included both the eponymous ''muran'' variety as well as large-scale ''aba'' hunts.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=184}} Several thousand soldiers were required for the ''aba'' hunt. A temporary imperial camp would be placed north of the hunting site. On the day of the hunt, the participants would be split into a left wing and a right wing, arrayed in two semi-circular groups spread out over a distance of several miles. Once the two semi-circles had joined, the wing leaders would order the men to close in. The circle would then be reduced to a size of two or three [[li (unit)|li]] in circumference, gathering the prey within.

The emperor, having arrived at the campsite by this point, entered the enclosure on horseback and had the honor of the first shot. To protect him from potentially dangerous game such as bears or tigers, the emperor would be accompanied by a number of troops such as the "tiger-gun brigade". If a tiger was caught, the emperor usually killed it personally, as part of the spectacle demonstrating the bravery and martial skill of the imperial lineage.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=73–74}} In 1692, the Kangxi Emperor killed a bear by wounding it with an arrow and finishing it off with a pike. Under the Kangxi Emperor, tiger hunts were conducted by having captive animals brought in cages, and then releasing them into the hunting grounds.{{sfn|Allsen|2011|p=88}}

===Official business===
While the emperor was hunting at Mulan, the business of government continued. The "traveling camp" of the imperial government was arranged so as to mirror the layout of the government offices around the Forbidden City. Messengers relayed information between Beijing, the Chengde resort, and Mulan, allowing the emperors and his entourage of imperial officials to do their work in the field. According to one official, there were no desks in the tents, and work had to be done by candlelight.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=75–77}}

===Entertainment===
At the end of the hunting season, the emperor held a feast for all participants, followed by a special feast just for Mongol and [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] leaders. Such events were an opportunity for the emperor to spend time with his Inner Asian subjects, many of whom did not travel south to China proper for fear of [[smallpox]]. In addition to banquets, the emperor also presented and received gifts, and gave out titles.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=73–74}} Many entertainments were provided, including archery and [[wrestling]] contests, as well as mock battles.{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|p=84}} Lord Macartney, in his 1793 mission, observed wrestling, [[acrobatics]], [[juggling]], [[theatre]], and [[fireworks]] displays, but was disappointed that an expected display of feats of horsemanship did not appear, as he had heard that the "[[Tartary|Tartars]]", as he called them, were quite skilled in such arts. During the performances, Macartney noted that the audience was completely silent. Macartney, eager to get on with his diplomatic mission, was nonetheless obliged by court etiquette to watch these displays and receive gifts from the emperor throughout the day.{{sfn|Peyrefitte|2013|pp=253–255}}

==Political significance==

===Propaganda===
[[File:Portrait of the Emperor Troating for Deer - detail.jpg|thumb|Detail from ''Portrait of the Emperor Troating for Deer'', by Giuseppe Castiglione (1741)]]
The hunts at Mulan were commemorated in paintings produced by the imperial court, much like other military rituals of the Qing.{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|p=84}} This was especially true in the Qianlong era, in which commemorative art also portrayed the triennual grand inspections (''dayue''){{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|p=71}} of [[Eight Banners]] troops, and the dual rituals of dispatching armies (''mingjiang'') and welcoming their return (''jiaolao'').{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|pp=75–76}} These works of art, as well as the activities depicted in them, all formed part of the Qianlong Emperor's propaganda campaign to promote martial values in Qing society.{{sfn|Allsen|2011|p=139}}

Many of these paintings were done under the direction of Giuseppe Castiglione, the Jesuit missionary who served as one of Qianlong's court painters. A number of paintings produced during Qianlong's reign portray the emperor himself participating in the autumn hunt at Mulan, as well as in the other military rituals of the Qing. In particular, Castiglione produced a series of four scroll paintings about the Mulan hunt.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=185}} He and his apprentices also produced a number of horse paintings, reviving a subject that had not been popular since the Tang dynasty. A [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] horse presented as a gift to the Qianlong Emperor serves as his mount in Castiglione's painting of the grand inspection of the troops, as well as in paintings of the emperor hunting.{{sfn|Crossley|1999|pp=274–275}} Copies of martially-themed paintings were disseminated widely in a variety of formats, conveying a message of military might both at home and abroad, as well as impressing a martial stamp upon domestic mass culture.{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|pp=84–87}}

===Diplomacy and ethnic policy===
[[File:LordMacartneyEmbassyToChina1793.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Lord Macartney's embassy to China, 1793]]
Mulan, and later Chengde, also played an important diplomatic role. It was at Chengde that Qianlong received the Macartney Embassy, cutting short his hunting trip to do so. As part of the Qing emperors' patronage of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], several temples were built in the Tibetan style around Chengde, including the [[Puning Temple (Hebei)|Puning Temple]] (1755, modeled after [[Samye Monastery]]), and the [[Putuo Zongcheng Temple]] (1771, modeled after the [[Potala Palace]]). It was also at Chengde that the Sixth Panchen Lama visited Qianlong in 1780, for which occasion the [[Xumi Fushou Temple]] was erected.{{sfn|Forêt|2000|p=159}} At the hunting sites of Mulan, the Kangxi Emperor met with [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]], [[Kharchin Mongols|Kharchin]], and [[Dörbet Oirat|Dörbet]] leaders. Likewise, Qianlong often pronounced edicts affecting Inner Asians at the hunting grounds.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=75–77}}

The hunt itself, its proximity to the Yuan dynasty summer capital of the Mongols, the practice of living in tents or [[yurt]]s, and the banquets held in honor of Mongol officials, all served to ingratiate the emperors of the Qing dynasty with their ethnic Mongol subjects and allies in particular, as well as Inner Asians generally.{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=73–74}} From the beginning of the Qing dynasty, Manchu emperors positioned themselves not only as the [[Emperor of China|emperors of China]], but also as [[Great Khan]]s in the mold of [[Genghis Khan|Genghis]] and Kublai. Originally the khan of the later Jin dynasty, [[Hong Taiji]] renamed his empire the Great Qing and declared himself its emperor in 1636 after receiving the surrender of the [[Chahars|Chahar Mongols]].{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=63}} The Qing sponsorship of Tibetan Buddhism was inherited from the Mongol tradition.{{sfn|Wakeman Jr.|1986|p=203}} The secondary capital and its hunting grounds, both outside the Great Wall, thus bolstered the Qing emperors' rhetoric of having brought the inner (Chinese) and outer (Mongol, Tibetan, Uyghur and so on) peoples together into one "family" (''neiwai yijia'').{{sfn|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=75–77}}

===As ritual===
[[File:The Qianlong Emperor Hunting Hare.jpg|thumb|320px|''The Qianlong Emperor Hunting Hare'' by Giuseppe Castiglione (1755)]]
The Qing dynasty imperial hunts became increasingly elaborate and ritualized over time, particularly under the Qianlong Emperor. As hunting became uncommon among the Manchus, the majority of whom lived in the walled city of Beijing or the various Eight Banner garrisons throughout the empire, the imperial hunt at Mulan became one of the last contexts in which Manchu hunting skills could be practiced, and only by a select few. The institutionalization of the hunt led to its new role as a sort of performance, a stylized homage to past practices that were no longer living traditions for most Manchus. Hence, [[Mark Elliott (historian)|Elliott]] has referred to the Qing hunting tradition as an invented tradition, an "adaptation of an older practice for newer purposes".{{sfn|Elliott|2001|pp=186–187}} This adaptation emphasized what Qing emperors considered most important in Manchu culture as they saw it, namely their supposed embodiment of martial (''wu'') values, as opposed to the civil (''wen'') values that they attributed to the Chinese (see [[wen and wu]]). The Qianlong Emperor likened himself to Emperor Taizong of Tang, who represented a balance of ''wen'' and ''wu''. Yet despite presenting themselves as the head of a family encompassing both Chinese and Inner Asian traditions, Qing emperors constantly worried about Manchu acculturation and the adoption of Chinese ways.{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|pp=2–5}}

Part of the imperial hunt's new significance was its perceived value as a form of military training. A Qing dictionary defined the ''aba'' hunt as a way of "training for military proficiency".{{sfn|Allsen|2011|pp=215–216}} Theoretically, all Manchus were part of the hereditary warrior caste of the [[Eight Banners]], a military organization which expanded rapidly to include Mongol and Han Chinese contingents during the Qing conquest of the Ming. Military skill, hunting, and Manchu ethnic identity were deeply intertwined. As [[John Bell (traveller)|John Bell]] wrote, Kangxi saw the hunt as a way to prevent the Manchus from acquiring the perceived Chinese traits of "idleness and effeminacy".{{sfn|Allsen|2011|p=120}} Kangxi's fears had been shared by his grandfather, Hong Taiji, who believed that the Jin dynasty of his Jurchen ancestors had collapsed as a result of entering the "Chinese Way", to the neglect of their archery and riding skills. The Yongzheng and Qianlong Emperors frequently criticized slipping standards and laziness among the troops of the [[Eight Banners]].{{sfn|Elliott|2001|pp=276–284}} Qianlong, unlike Kangxi, Hong Taiji, and [[Nurhaci]], never led military campaigns in person.{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|p=105}} The annual hunt, as reinstitued under Qianlong, thus represented the best remaining opportunity he had to personally direct his armies in their military training, as well as to regularly reaffirm old Manchu ways through codified ritual in the face of a rapidly shifting Manchu culture.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|pp=186–187}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="87051">[[Instant-runoff voting]] (IRV) is used for state and congressional elections in [[Maine]] and for local elections in 11 cities, where it is often called "ranked-choice voting." Those cities include [[San Francisco, California]]; [[Oakland, California]]; [[Berkeley, California]]; [[San Leandro, California]]; [[Takoma Park, Maryland]]; [[Basalt, Colorado]]; [[Telluride, Colorado]]; [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]; [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]; [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], and [[Portland, Maine]]. It is pending implementation in several cities. IRV is commonly used for student government and other non-governmental elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/rcv#where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used|title=Where is Ranked Choice Voting Used?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fairvote.org|publisher=FairVote|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1912 and 1930, limited forms of IRV (typically with only two rankings&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vc0c0KQR2pgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Effective Voting: An Article on Preferential Voting and Proportional Representation|last=Hoag|first=Clarence Gilbert|date=1914|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) were implemented and subsequently repealed in the states of [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Maryland]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Wisconsin]].  In the 1970s, it was implemented and repealed in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://migreens.org/hvgreens/aa-irv01.htm|title=Instant Runoff Voting: History in Ann Arbor, Michigan|last=Walter|first=Benjamin|date=2001-08-26|work=Green Party of Michigan|access-date=2018-01-02|archive-url=https://archive.today/20080917220033/http://migreens.org/hvgreens/aa-irv01.htm|archive-date=17 September 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, it was adopted and repealed in [[Pierce County, Washington]] (2006-2009);&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.sos.wa.gov/FromOurCorner/index.php/2009/11/pierce-voters-nix-ranked-choice-voting/|title=Pierce voters nix 'ranked-choice voting' – From Our Corner|last=|first=|date=November 10, 2009|website=blogs.sos.wa.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burlington, Vermont]] (2005-2010);&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vprarchive.vpr.net/vpr-news/burlington-voters-repeal-instant-runoff-voting/|title=Burlington Voters Repeal Instant Runoff Voting|last=McCrea|first=Lynne|date=2010-03-03|website=Vermont Public Radio|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aspen, Colorado]] (2007-2010);&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aspendailynews.com/city-voters-repeal-irv/article_5d3a9245-bfc1-55db-947b-fefdb87031ea.html|title=City voters repeal IRV|last=Wackerle|first=Curtis|date=Nov 3, 2010|work=Aspen Daily News|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in North Carolina, which allowed its use in elections between 2006 and 2013.

In 2016, voters in [[Maine]] approved an initiative to become the first state to use IRV statewide in elections for governor, state legislature, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House.&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2016/11/10/maine-became-the-first-state-in-the-country-to-pass-ranked-choice-voting|title=Maine became the first state in the country Tuesday to pass ranked choice voting|date=10 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts by the state legislature and state supreme court to delay the implementation of IRV, a "people's veto" referendum campaign kept the IRV law in place, with the state supreme court ruling that IRV would be introduced for the primary on June 12, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mainerankedchoice.vote|title=Ranked Choice Voting {{!}} Maine Voters Rank Candidates|website=Maine Uses Ranked Choice Voting|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that election, Maine voters re-affirmed implementation of IRV by popular referendum while using IRV for the first time in primaries for the offices of governor, U.S. House, and state legislator.&lt;ref name=Maine2018 /&gt;

In November 2018, Maine's ranked-choice voting system affected the [[United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Maine,_2018#Results_6|outcome of the election]] for [[Maine's 2nd congressional district]]. Though the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Bruce Poliquin]] led the first-round count by over 2,000 votes, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Jared Golden]] won with a majority of nearly 3,000 after votes for [[independent (politician)|independent]] candidates Tiffany Bond and Will Hoar transferred to the top two candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/11/15/668296045/ranked-choice-voting-delivers-another-victory-to-house-democrats |title=Ranked-Choice Voting Delivers Democrats A House Seat |date=15 November 2018 |publisher=[[NPR]] |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use at state and federal levels==
===Maine, (2016) 2018–present===
[[Maine Question 5, 2016]] asked Maine voters whether to implement instant-runoff voting for primary and general elections for governor, U.S. Senate, U.S. House and state legislature, starting in 2018. It was approved by 52% to 48%, making Maine the first state to use instant-runoff voting for all such elections.&lt;ref name="boston.com"/&gt; However, on May 23, 2017, the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]] issued an advisory opinion stating that the state constitution specified that for general elections for governor and the state legislature only a plurality was required to win, which is not consistent with the use of instant-runoff voting and its multi-round vote transfers to ensure majority support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728801-Maine-Supreme-Judicial-Court-ruling-on-Ranked.html |title=Opinion of the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court |date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "people's veto" referendum campaign suspended the law delaying RCV. In April 2018, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruled against a legal challenge seeking to preference IRV from being used in the state's elections starting in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2018/04/17/politics/maines-top-court-clears-way-for-ranked-choice-voting-in-june/|title=Maine’s top court clears way for ranked-choice voting in June|work=Bangor Daily News|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislature in June debated legislation to propose a  constitutional amendment, to repeal the measure entirely, and to keep instant-runoff voting in place for elections for U.S. Senate, U.S. House and primaries. All bills failed to pass in the regularly scheduled legislative sessions filed to pass, but the legislature voted in October 2017 to delay implementation until 2021, by which time either a constitutional amendment must be adopted or the entire law would be considered repealed.&lt;ref name="Portland Press Herald"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thistle|first1=Scott|title=Legislature delays and potentially repeals ranked-choice voting|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2017/10/23/in-special-session-legislature-cant-break-impasse-on-ranked-choice-voting/|accessdate=28 October 2017|publisher=Portland Press Herald|date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maine voters then collected enough signatures to force a "[[people's veto]]" of the parts of the new law that blocked use of instant-runoff voting for primary and congressional elections. The people's veto, [[Maine Question 1, June 2018|Question 1]], passed in the June 12, 2018 election, which was also the first election that used IRV for state and federal offices, including Republican and Democratic primaries for governor, Democratic primary for the 2nd Congressional District, and Republican primary for House District 75.&lt;ref name=Maine2018&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pressherald.com/2018/06/12/ranked-choice-voting-takes-lead-in-early-balloting/ |title=Mainers vote to keep ranked-choice voting, with supporters holding commanding lead |publisher=Portland Press Herald |author=Eric Russell |date=12 June 2018 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Carolina, 2006–2013===
A 2006 law had established that IRV would be used when judicial vacancies were created between a primary election and sixty days before a general election.  In November 2010, [[North Carolina]] had three IRV elections for local-level [[North Carolina Superior Court|superior court]] judges, each with three candidates, and [[North Carolina judicial elections, 2010#Court of Appeals (Wynn seat)|a statewide IRV election]] for a [[North Carolina Court of Appeals]] seat (with 13 candidates). The Court of Appeals race is believed to be the first time IRV has been used in any statewide general election in the United States.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The statewide IRV law was repealed by the General Assembly in 2013 as part of a sweeping [[voter ID]] bill, meaning that special judicial elections with more than two candidates would once again be decided by a simple plurality.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/election-changes-coming-in-2014-2016/12750290/|title=Q&amp;A: Changes to NC election laws|last=Binker|first=Mark|date=|website=WRAL.com|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v9.pdf|title=GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF NORTH CAROLINA : SESSION 2013 : SESSION LAW 2013-381 : HOUSE BILL 589|website=Ncleg.net|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Party primaries, caucuses, and conventions===
====Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, 1912-1930====
In the United States, IRV election laws were first adopted in 1912. Five states ([[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Maryland]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Wisconsin]]) used versions of IRV for party [[primary election|primaries]], typically with each voter having two rankings and candidates needing to finish in the top two to advance to the instant runoff. By 1930 each jurisdiction had replaced IRV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/irv/vt_lite/history.htm|title=The History of Instant Runoff Voting|last=|first=|date=|website=FairVote.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028050940/http://www.fairvote.org/irv/vt_lite/history.htm|archivedate=October 28, 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairvotemn.org/sites/fairvotemn.org/files/Municipal%20Voting%20System%20Reform%20article.pdf|title=Municipal Voting System Reform: Overcoming the Legal Obstacles|last=Solgård|first=Tony Anderson|author2=Paul Landskroener|website=Fairvotemn.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002231/http://fairvotemn.org/sites/fairvotemn.org/files/Municipal%20Voting%20System%20Reform%20article.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHLvGawRmEwC&amp;pg|title=Democracy in Divided Societies: Electoral Engineering for Conflict Management|last=Reilly|first=Ben|date=2001-09-13|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521797306|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Republican Party of Utah====
After voting to authorize its use, the Republican Party of [[Utah]] used instant runoff voting in 2002, 2003 and 2004 at its statewide convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairvote.org/editorials/herald.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724222543/http://fairvote.org/editorials/herald.htm |archivedate=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including in a contested race to nominate a governor in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairvote.org/irv/utahresults.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205061342/http://www.fairvote.org/irv/utahresults.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Republicans used repeated balloting for its statewide convention and has done so in subsequent years. Some county Republican parties like Cache County continue to use instant runoff voting at their conventions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cachegop.com/web/bylaws.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106034733/http://www.cachegop.com/web/bylaws.pdf |archivedate=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and IRV was used by Republicans to fill several state legislative vacancies in 2009-2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/e-newsletter-january-28-201#rtv |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045132/http://www.fairvote.org/e-newsletter-january-28-201 |archivedate=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Democratic Party of Virginia====
In 2014, the Democratic Party of [[Arlington, Virginia]] used IRV in two "firehouse primaries" for countywide office that each drew several thousand voters, and it joined with the  Democratic Party of  Fairfax county that year to use IRV  in a seven-candidate primary election for a special election for the House of Delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Grace |last=Ramsey  |url=http://www.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/blog/party-in-major-virginia-county-uses-instant-runoff-voting-and-voters-like-it/ |title=Party in Major Virginia County Uses Instant Runoff Voting – and Voters Like It |work=FairVote.org  |date=2014-12-05 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arlington Democrats also used the system in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Ethan |last=Fitzgerald  |url=http://www.fairvote.org/over_1_700_virginia_democrats_participate_in_ranked_choice_voting_election |title= Over 1,700 Virginia Democrats Participate in Ranked Choice Voting Election|work=FairVote.org  |date=2016-05-24 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRV was also used in 2014 by leaders of the Henrico County Democrats in a three-candidate special election nomination contest for the House of Delegates in December 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt |first=Markus |url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/kevin-sullivan-defends-firehouse-primary-for-morrissey-s-seat/article_f3506d23-c62d-5c91-986a-8ff16b99996d.html |title=Kevin Sullivan defends firehouse primary for Morrissey's seat - Roanoke Times: Politics |website=Roanoke.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, the Democratic Party of [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], held its first "open caucus" to select its nominees for city council and sheriff, using instant runoff voting. Voter turnout was close 1,600 voters. There were two incumbents and one challenger running for two nominations in the city council race. One incumbent was renominated and another defeated without the need for an instant runoff. Three candidates ran in the sheriff's race. No candidate won an initial majority. In the instant runoff, James E. Brown III defeated Mike Baird.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairvote.org/blog/2009/05/charlottesville-va-democrats-use-irv-to-nominate-candidates-in-high-turnout-open-caucus/]{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the Party again used to nominate candidates. Voter turnout rose to 2,582 in the city council race for three nominations. Two candidates were nominated with a majority of the first round vote. The final nomination was determined by IRV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvillepedia.org/mediawiki/images/2011_Democratic_Primary_City_Council_Votes.pdf |format=PDF |title=Vote Count Summary for City Council |website=Cvillepedia.org |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Independence Party of Minnesota (2004 Presidential poll)====
In part to increase awareness of the voting method and to demonstrate it in a real-world situation, the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]] tested IRV by using it in a [[straw poll]] during the 2004 [[Minnesota]] [[caucus]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnip.org/caucusresults.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206193035/http://mnip.org/caucusresults.shtml |archivedate=February 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poll allowed a [[none of the above]] option which could not be eliminated. Their rules eliminated one weakest candidate at a time, or all candidates in a tie at the bottom. They continued the elimination until only one candidate remained to confirm that this candidate had more support than NOTA.

This summary table shows the first round, and final five rounds, excluding five rounds during which 18 weak candidates were eliminated.

====Oakland====
The city of [[Oakland, California]], passed (69%) a measure in November 2006 to adopt IRV for 18 city offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/11/08/BAG9LM8J2U4.DTL Offbeat and practical issues taken up around Bay Area], Heather Knight, [[San Francisco Chronicle]], Nov. 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_14132699 |title=Instant-runoff voting a go for Oakland |publisher=Inside Bay Area |date= |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, Oakland used IRV to elect its mayor, three city council races and four other local offices, with elections for mayor and council district four requiring multiple rounds of counting.&lt;ref name="acgov.org"/&gt; It used IRV in the city's remaining elected offices in 2012. IRV was again used in 2014 and 2016, including in the 2014 mayoral election in which  incumbent [[Jean Quan]] was  defeated by [[Libby Schaaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Oakland,_California_municipal_elections,_2014 |title=Oakland, California municipal elections, 2014 |publisher=Ballotpedia |date= |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2010 mayoral election=====
Oakland's 2010 mayoral election was an open-seat election in which no candidate earned more than 34% of votes in the first round. In the tally, candidates were eliminated sequentially, with three candidates far ahead in first choices. After the count of first choices, Don Perata was in first place, Jean Quan in second place, and Rebecca Kaplan in third place. They remained in that order of votes after all other candidates were eliminated and their votes re-allocated. When Kaplan was then eliminated, Quan picked up 18,864 votes from Kaplan backers while Perata was the next choice of only 6,407 Kaplan backers. As a result, Quan won a final round majority when matched against Perata, which means she was ranked ahead of Perata on a majority of ballots in which one of them received a ranking.(11% of voters did not rank either of them, making their votes "exhausted" by the time of the final round.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acgov.org/rov/rcv/results/rcvresults_2984.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115182601/http://www.acgov.org/rov/rcv/results/rcvresults_2984.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====San Francisco====
[[San Francisco]] has used IRV for its Board of Supervisors and most citywide offices nearly every November since 2004. In March 2002, an initiative backed by a broad coalition of civic organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sfrcv.org/articles/fulfillthewill.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2004-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027065038/http://www.sfrcv.org/articles/fulfillthewill.htm |archive-date=2004-10-27 |dead-url=bot: unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt; won 55% of the vote to adopt instant runoff voting. This implementation allows the voter to rank three candidates and uses sequential candidate elimination until one candidate earns a majority of votes cast for remaining candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Richard |last=Gonzales |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3864851 |title=San Francisco Adopts Instant Runoff Elections |publisher=NPR |date=2004-08-23 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A unanimous panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has upheld San Francisco's IRV law as constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=dudum+v+arntz&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2003&amp;case=438379963242494061&amp;scilh=0 |title=Google Scholar |website=Scholar.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRV was first used in October 2004 for [[YouthVOTE]], an election held throughout San Francisco's public schools which elected the San Francisco school board's student delegate;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0411/S00013.htm |title=And It's 1, 2, 3: That's What We're Fighting For &amp;#124; Scoop News |website=Scoop.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; after that, it was used in the November 2004 supervisoral races and every November since that time for at least one election in the city. IRV has played a decisive role in at least one city election in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfrcv.com |title=SFRCV |publisher=Sfrcv.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exit polls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pri.sfsu.edu/reports/SFSU-PRI_RCV_final_report_July_17_2006.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 28, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728043742/http://pri.sfsu.edu/reports/SFSU-PRI_RCV_final_report_July_17_2006.pdf |archivedate=July 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by San Francisco State University have shown support for the new system from all groupings of voters.

The San Francisco Department of Elections prefers the term [[Ranked voting systems|Ranked Choice Voting]] (RCV) because "the word 'instant' might create an expectation that final results will be available ''immediately'' after the polls close on election night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/media/irv/sanfrancisco/RCVCandidateGuide04.pdf|title=Ranked-Choice Voting: A Guide for Candidates|last=Arntz|first=John|date=February 2, 2005|website=|publisher=Department of Elections: City and County of San Francisco|via=[[FairVote]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202040611/http://fairvote.org/media/irv/sanfrancisco/RCVCandidateGuide04.pdf|archivedate=December 2, 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=August 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department releases first choice totals immediately, but used to wait until more absentee ballots have arrived before running instant runoff ballot counts. That practice has since changed.

San Francisco continues to hold IRV elections as of 2017, several of which have gone to multiple rounds of counting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfbetterelections.com/reports.html |title=Reports - Better Elections in San Francisco |website=Sfbetterelections.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, for example, two candidates won who were not the leaders in first choice rankings.

Election results for 2004, 2005, and 2006 are provided in greater detail below.

=====2004 results=====
There were four elections that used the instant runoff process after no majority winner in the first round: Districts 1,5,7, and 11.
* District 1: There were 7 candidates, reduced to 2 candidates in 4 rounds. The winner won 54% of the final round count, which amounted to 48.67% of the total first-round votes, with 9.89% of the ballots exhausted by the final round.
* District 5: There were 22 candidates, reduced to 3 in 19 rounds, when the winner had a majority of active ballots. The winner finished with 50.6% of the final round vote against two runners up, which amounted to 37.63% of the first-round vote with 25.63% of the ballots exhausted.
* District 7: There were 13 candidates, reduced to 2 in 11 rounds. The winner finished with 57% of the votes cast for the two active candidates in the final round. Of first round votes, this amounted to 43.72% of the first-round vote, with 23.12% exhausted ballots.
* District 11: There were 8 candidates, reduced to 2 in 6 rounds. The winner finished with 58% of the final round vote, which amounted to 46.08% of the total first-round vote, with 21.01% of the ballots exhausted.

The District 5 results are included below as the largest election from 2004 and most round of counting. The elimination table shows the candidates reordered by their elimination. The elimination process was stable for the highest 5 candidates, holding their same plurality ranking each round despite the 19 rounds of elimination and transfer votes.

The IRV elimination process was halted when candidate Mirkarimi reached more than 50% of the active ballots, but only 37.6% of the total first-round ballots. This stopping point is pragmatic for picking a winner, but fails to show how many votes the winner had compared to only the strongest runner up candidate.

Notes:
* The source summary listed ''Eligible ballots'' each round as nonexhausted ballots. This is shown here.
* The source summary listed ''Exhausted ballots'' as ALL exhausted ballots, including ballots with no marks at all on the election. This table subtracts exhausted the 4146 ballots that supported no candidates to be consistent with other tables in this article.
* Similarly the source listed ''Total ballots'' to include eligible and exhausted ballots. Here the no-mark ballots were also removed from the total.
* The final column "Plurality candidate %" is based on votes for the top candidate divided by this adjusted total ballots.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Preferential block voting|block voting]] tally based on the first and second rank choices was used to determine first round support. Any candidate with initial majority support was elected. If there were not two first-round winners, there was a batch elimination of low-placing candidates to reduce the number of continuing candidates before the instant runoff. In the latter case, separate IRV runoffs would be conducted for each council seat, with the winner of the first seat eliminated from the race for the second seat.

Aspen's first elections with IRV and the new city council system were on May 5, 2009. The number of voters was the highest in the history of Aspen elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In November 2010, voters in [[Portland, Maine]], adopted a charter amendment with 52% to establish a directly elected mayor, using instant runoff voting. The first election was in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pressherald.com/news/portland-returns-to-electing-its-mayor_2010-11-03.html |title=Portland returns to electing its mayor - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram |website=Pressherald.com |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen candidates ran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandvotes123.com |title=Home |website=PortlandVotes123 |date= |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner Michael Brennan led with 27% of first choices and won decisively in the final instant runoff voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koenig |first=Seth |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2011/11/09/news/portland/brennan-to-become-portland%E2%80%99s-first-popularly-elected-mayor-in-88-years/ |title=Brennan to become Portland's first popularly elected mayor in 88 years — Portland — Bangor Daily News — BDN Maine |website=Bangordailynews.com |date=2011-11-09 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Brennan ran for re-election against two opponents and was defeated by Ethan Strimling.

====Takoma Park====
The city of [[Takoma Park, Maryland]] adopted instant runoff voting for city council and mayoral elections in 2006 after voters approved it with 84% support in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.fairvote.org/assessing-instant-runoff-voting-in-takoma-park-md- |title=Assessing Instant Runoff Voting in Takoma Park (MD) |work=FairVote.org |date= March 28, 2007|accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007 the first IRV election was held to fill a city council vacancy in a three-way race with a majority winner in the first round. Voters selected Reuben Snipper with 107 votes (52.7%), defeating Eric Hensal with 72 votes (35.5%) and Alexandra Quéré Barrionuevo with 23 votes (11.3%) and one write-in. Snipper said the possibility of using the IRV system changed the race's dynamics. "I had every reason to believe this was going to be a close race," he said. "It meant that when I knocked on a door, if a person indicated they were going to vote for another candidate, I didn't just leave right away. I tried to persuade them I would be a good second choice."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/07/AR2007020700985.html Takoma Park's New Vote System Makes Debut], Miranda S.

There was much debate whether IRV was successful when it was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carynews.com/news/story/8057.html |title=Opinion mixed on Cary's instant-runoff trial |first=Adam |last=Arnold |date=Jan 22, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203232045/http://www.carynews.com/news/story/8057.html |archivedate=2008-02-03 |accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate continued in the North Carolina legislature when it debated legislation to extend the pilot program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2007&amp;BillID=S1263 Senate Bill 1263], [[General Assembly of North Carolina]], Session 2007-8&lt;/ref&gt; Some verified voting advocates contended that the IRV tabulation procedures used were not legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncvoter.net |format=PDF |title=N. C. Coalition for Verified Voting |website=Ncvoter.net |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both advocates and opponents of the provision supported amendments to the pilot program to: ensure that the local governing body of any jurisdiction participating in the pilot must approve their participation; the jurisdiction must develop and implement voter education plans; and the UNC School of Government by January 2009 must approve procedures for conducting IRV elections. After these amendments were adopted, the state House of Representatives, by a majority of 65-47, rejected an amendment designed to remove the pilot program from the legislation, and the legislation ultimately won approval by both houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2007&amp;BillID=S1263&amp;votesToView=all |title=North Carolina General Assembly - Senate Bill 1263 Information/History (2007-2008 Session) |website=Ncga.state.nc.us |date= |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Hendersonville again used IRV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/story/1518353.html |title='Patient's bill' also boon to chiropractors, therapists |first1=Benjamin |last1=Niolet |first2=Ryan Teague |last2=Beckwith |publisher=''The News &amp; Observer |date=May 8, 2009 |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511160222/http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/story/1518353.html |archivedate=May 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Cary Town Council voted to use a traditional runoff method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.wral.com/news/news_briefs/story/5060298/ |title=Cary votes to keep current election method |website=WRAL.com |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three candidates ran for mayor in Hendersonville in November 2009; five candidates ran for two seats on the city council using a multi-seat version of IRV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hendersoncountync.org/elections/cont_cand_rpt_3g.pdf]{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All seats were filled based on first choices without the need for instant runoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueridgenow.com/article/20091103/NEWS/910299988/1151?Title=Volk-Smith-Collis-win-Hendersonville-election]{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Hendersonville's city council unanimously voted to use IRV a third time, although ultimately not enough candidates filed for office to trigger the need for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harbin |first=John |url=http://www.blueridgenow.com/article/20110408/NEWS/110409860/1016/OPINION02?Title=Hendersonville-votes-to-keep-instant-runoff-ballots |title=Hendersonville votes to keep instant runoff ballots |website=BlueRidgeNow.com |date=2011-04-08 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRV pilot program was repealed by the General Assembly in 2013 as part of a sweeping "[[voter ID]]" bill, meaning that special judicial elections with more than two candidates would once again be decided by a simple plurality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

====Cary====
In October 2007 the city of [[Cary, North Carolina]] used [[Instant-runoff voting|batch-elimination IRV]] for municipal election for three council seats and for mayor. The mayor's race (with two candidates) and two of the council seats (with four and three candidates on the ballot) were won with a majority in the first round. The remaining council seat, with three candidates, went to a second round of counting under the instant runoff system; the plurality winner in the first round went on to win with 50.9% of the final round vote, amounting to 46.4% of first-round ballots cast, with 8.9% of the ballots offering no preference between the top two candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wakegov.com/elections/results.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111111349/http://www.wakegov.com/elections/results.htm |archivedate=January 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cary used hand or machine-marked paper ballots that are read on optical scanners manufactured by ES&amp;S. First column choices were tallied at the precinct. The second and third column choices were counted at a central location.
===Oregon===
====Benton County====
On November 8, 2016, voters in [[Benton County, Oregon]], passed a charter amendment with 54.3% of the vote to enact IRV for county elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.co.benton.or.us/elections/page/nov-8-2016-general-election-results-and-turnout|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of IRV will take place in November 2020, after the state legislature in 2018 appropriated funds to enable the county to administer the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betterballotbenton.com/|title=Better Ballots for Benton|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114011853/http://www.betterballotbenton.com/|archive-date=2016-11-14|dead-url=|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Tennessee===
====Memphis====
On November 4, 2008, voters in the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee]], passed a charter amendment with 71% of the vote to enact IRV for city elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shelbyvote.com/scVote/dotShowDoc/scvote/electionResults/content/electionResults.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108042548/http://www.shelbyvote.com/scVote/dotShowDoc/scvote/electionResults/content/electionResults.htm |archivedate=November 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of IRV has been dependent on the city's ability to administer the election: it is scheduled for 2019, however, the city council voted in 2017 to place a referendum to repeal IRV on the 2018 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.memphisflyer.com/NewsBlog/archives/2017/12/05/city-council-votes-to-repeal-instant-runoff-voting|title=City Council Votes to Repeal Instant Runoff Voting|last=Smith|first=Maya|work=Memphis Flyer|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Utah===

In 2018, Utah passed a law allowing municipalities to opt in to IRV voting starting with 2019 municipal elections.&lt;ref name="bgm" /&gt;

===Vermont===
====2005-2010, Burlington: mayor====
{{see also|Burlington, Vermont mayoral election, 2009}}The city of [[Burlington, Vermont]] approved IRV for use in mayoral elections with a 64% vote in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burlingtonvotes.org/faq 4. How did this change to IRV come about?] ''Over 64% of Burlington voters voted in favor of the IRV Charter amendment in March, 2005, and it went into effect on May 12, 2005, when the governor signed the ratification bill, H.505, which had been passed by both the House and Senate.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2006 Burlington mayoral race was decided after two rounds of IRV tallying, and the mayoral race in 2009 was decided in three rounds. Unlike Burlington's first IRV mayoral election in 2006, the IRV winner in 2009 ([[Vermont Progressive Party|VT Progressive]] candidate [[Bob Kiss]]) was neither the same as the [[plurality voting system|plurality]] winner ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate Kurt Wright) nor the [[Condorcet method|Condorcet]] winner ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate Andy Montroll).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vermontdailybriefing.com/?p%3D1215 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726125759/http://vermontdailybriefing.com/?p=1215 |archivedate=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rangevoting.org/Burlington.html |title=Burlington Vermont 2009 IRV mayoral election |website=RangeVoting.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The repeal reverted the system back to a 40% rule that requires a top-two runoff if no candidate exceeds 40% of the vote. Had the 2009 election occurred under these rules, Kiss and Wright would have advanced to the runoff. If the same voters had participated in the runoff as in the first election and not changed their preferences, Kiss would have won the runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ci.burlington.vt.us/ct/elections/irv/|title=City of Burlington, Vermont {{!}} Instant Runoff Voting|last=|first=|date=2011-09-28|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928110147/http://www.ci.burlington.vt.us/ct/elections/irv/|archive-date=2011-09-28|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-08}} - FAQ 5. for IRV: Under the old [pre-IRV] system a candidate could be elected with just over 40% of the vote, meaning a candidate could win even though seen as the last choice of nearly 60% of the voters .&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, an initiative effort to increase the winning threshold from the 40% plurality to a 50% majority failed.

===Washington===
====2006-2009, Pierce County====
[[Pierce County, Washington]], passed (53%) instant runoff voting in November 2006 for most of its county offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piercecountywa.org/pc/abtus/ourorg/aud/elections/rcv.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109164811/http://www.piercecountywa.org/pc/abtus/ourorg/aud/elections/rcv.htm |archivedate=January 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters upheld the 2008 implementation timing with a vote of 67% in 2007 and made minor adjustments to the charter language involving ballot access and numbers of rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co.pierce.wa.us/pc/abtus/ourorg/aud/elections/misc/currentresults.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208222430/http://www.co.pierce.wa.us/pc/abtus/ourorg/aud/elections/misc/currentresults.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven instant runoff voting elections took place on November 4, 2008 and one on November 3, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co.pierce.wa.us/pc/abtus/ourorg/aud/elections/RCV/ranked/rcvresults.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108063824/http://www.co.pierce.wa.us/pc/abtus/ourorg/aud/elections/RCV/ranked/rcvresults.htm |archivedate=November 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of IRV was marked by controversies about costs and a Supreme Court ruling that restored Washington State's [[nonpartisan blanket primary|top two election system]] passed statewide in 2004, but struck down by courts in 2005.

==Absentee use==
Several states jurisdictions that hold runoff elections allow certain categories of absentee voters to submit IRV ballots, because the interval between votes is too short for a second round of absentee voting. IRV ballots enable long-distance absentee votes to count in the second (general) election round if their first choice does not make the runoff. [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]] and [[South Carolina]] used  IRV ballots for overseas voters in 2014 and in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Drew Spencer |last=Penrose  |url=http://www.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/blog/proven-innovations-to-uphold-voting-rights-for-overseas-voters/ |title=Proven Innovations to Uphold Voting Rights for Overseas Voters |work=FairVote.org  |date= |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A city using this practice is [[Springfield, Illinois]] after voters approved it with 91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electionline.org/Portals/1/Publications/SC.EAP.2006primary.pdf |title=Initiatives – Pew Center on the States |publisher=Electionline.org |date= |accessdate=6 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516235221/http://www.electionline.org/Portals/1/Publications/SC.EAP.2006primary.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Louisiana uses it also for out-of-state members of the United States military and others who reside overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Implementations rejected==
Between 1912 and 1930, limited forms of IRV (typically with only two rankings&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) were implemented and subsequently repealed in the states of [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Maryland]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Wisconsin]].  In the 1970s, it was implemented and repealed in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  More recently, it was adopted and repealed in [[Pierce County, Washington]] (2006-2009);&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Burlington, Vermont]] (2005-2010);&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and [[Aspen, Colorado]] (2007-2010);&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and in North Carolina, which allowed its use in elections between 2006 and 2013. 

According to [[FairVote]], an organization advocating IRV, dozens of states have entertained instant runoff voting legislation since 2000. In 2008, Republican [[Vermont]] governor [[Jim Douglas]] vetoed legislation which would have established instant runoff voting for that state's congressional elections starting that year&lt;ref&gt;Kinzel, Bob, [http://www.vpr.net/news_detail/80010/douglas-vetoes-two-election-bills/ "Douglas vetoes two election bills"], Vermont Public Radio, April 4, 2008.

The city of [[Vancouver, Washington]] voted in 1999 to adopt instant runoff voting and the state legislature enacted enabling legislation in 2004, but the city in 2006 chose not to exercise its option. Instant runoff voting for all state and federal elections was on [[Alaska]]'s statewide ballot in August 2002, when it was defeated. It also was defeated by voters in [[Glendale, Arizona]], in 2008, in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]] in 2011, and in [[Duluth, Minnesota]] in 2015.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The information is published in the  document ''Class Names and the International Numbering System for Food Additives'', first published in 1989, with revisions in 2008 and 2011.  The INS is an open list, "subject to the inclusion of additional additives or removal of existing ones on an ongoing basis".&lt;ref name="1989doc" /&gt;

==Numbering system==
INS numbers consist of three or four digits, optionally followed by an alphabetical suffix to further characterize individual additives. On packaging in the [[European Union]] (EU), approved food additives are written with a prefix of ''E''. Australia and New Zealand do not use a prefix letter when listing additives in the ingredients. An additive that appears in the INS does not automatically have a corresponding [[E number]].

INS numbers are assigned by the committee to identify each food additive. INS numbers generally correspond to E numbers for the same compound, e.g. INS 102, [[Tartrazine]], is also E102. INS numbers are not unique and, in fact, one number may be assigned to a group of like compounds.

==List of INS numbers==
*Except where stated, the list of INS numbers and associated food additives is based on the most recent publication of the Codex Alimentarius, ''Class Names and the International Numbering System for Food Additives'', first published in 1989, with revisions in 2008 and 2011.
*E number and American approval flags are derived from other sources.
*In the table below, food additives approved for the EU are listed with an 'E',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers]&lt;/ref&gt; and those approved for Australia and New Zealand with an 'A'.&lt;ref name=fanl&gt;{{cite web|author=Food Standards Australia New Zealand |authorlink=Food Standards Australia New Zealand |title=Food Additives &amp;mdash; Numerical List |publisher=foodstandards.gov.au |year=2009 |url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/newsroom/publications/choosingtherightstuff/foodadditivesnumeric1680.cfm |accessdate=3 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625024756/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/newsroom/publications/choosingtherightstuff/foodadditivesnumeric1680.cfm |archivedate=25 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faal&gt;{{cite web |author=Food Standards Australia&amp;mdash;New Zealand |authorlink=Food Standards Australia New Zealand |title=Food additives &amp;mdash; Alphabetical list |publisher=foodstandards.gov.au |location=Australia |year=2009 |url= http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/newsroom/publications/choosingtherightstuff/foodadditivesalphaup1679.cfm |accessdate=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the US with a U, even though the US does not use the INS numbering system.

'''Jan Kranti Party''' ({{lang-hi|जन क्रांति पार्टी}}) was a [[political party]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India, based on [[Hindutva]]. It was founded by [[Kalyan Singh]], Former chief Minister of [[Uttar Pradesh]], on 5 January 2010 (in connection with Singh's 76th birthday) with Almirah as the Election Symbol of Jan Kranti Party.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/uttarpradesh/Kalyan-forms-new-Jan-Kranti-Party/Article1-493965.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The launching of the new party occurred two months after the alliance between Singh and the [[Samajwadi Party]] broke down.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.rediff.com/report/2010/jan/05/kalyan-singh-launches-jan-kranti-party.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the founding of the party, Singh handed over the leadership of the party to his son Rajveer Singh, who was named national president.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/01/06/stories/2010010660081400.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Kalyan's son to lead new party | date=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation of Party ==

Second time, citing neglect and humiliation in the party, the former Chief Minister and national Vice President of the BJP Kalyan Singh resigned from his post and the primary membership of the party on Tuesday, 20 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/PoliticsNation/Kalyan_Singh_resigns_from_BJP/articleshow/4006807.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Politics/Nation | date=20 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next day after meeting [[Samajwadi Party]] leaders [[Mulayam Singh Yadav]] and [[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]], Kalyan Singh announced that he would campaign for the SP in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200901211431.htm |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=Kalyan to campaign for SP |date=21 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103185730/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200901211431.htm |archivedate= 3 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile his son Rajveer Singh, one of the main reasons of his disenchantment with the BJP, joined the Samajwadi Party.&lt;ref&gt;http://week.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/contentView.do?contentId=5050928&amp;programId=1073754912&amp;pageTypeId=1073754893&amp;contentType=EDITORIAL&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November 2009, [[Mulayam Singh Yadav]] said that the poor performance of the party at the Firozabad Lok Sabha by-election was due to the loss of Muslim support because of Kalyan Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article49369.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=Atiq | last=Khan | title=Kalyan Singh calls Mulayam an ‘opportunist' | date=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snubbed by Mulayam Singh Yadav, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh on 15 November 2009, Kalyan Singh reaffirmed his allegiance to the BJP and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] and indicated he was willing to rejoin BJP while his son Rajbir Singh resigned from SP.

In January 2010, he announced the formation of a new [[Hindutva]]-oriented political party, the Jan Kranti Party, but chose to take the role of patron while his son became the leader.&lt;ref name="Kalyan's son to lead new party"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kalyan’s son to lead new party |date=6 January 2010 |work=The Hindu|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/01/06/stories/2010010657111000.htm |accessdate=30 April 2012 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the founding of the new party, Kalyan Singh declared that the intention of the party is to contest all 403 constituencies in the 2012 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election.&lt;ref name="hindu"/&gt;

== Merger with Bhartiya Janta Party ==

On 21 January 2013 [[Kalyan Singh]] announced the merger of his both formed parties, Rashtriya Kranti Party (RKP)which he formed after get suspended from [[BJP]] in 1999&lt;ref&gt;http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/third-time-lucky-kalyan-singh-bjp-reunion-on-the-cards/1/223944.html&lt;/ref&gt; and also merger of his later founded party in 2010, Jan Kranti Party (JKP) with his former parental party, [[Bhartiya Janta Party]] during the Atal Shankhnaad Rally of [[Bhartiya Janta Party|BJP]] in Lucknow's Jhulelal Park.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/kalyan-singh-merged-his-jan-kranti-party-with-bjp-restrained-himself-from-joining-1358856516-1#sthash.C3bwbb3S.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt; While former chief minister [[Kalyan Singh]] chose not to "officially join the BJP" on the advice of senior party leaders. The reason for this was that BJP leaders do not want Kalyan Singh, a Lok Sabha member from Etah elected in 2009 parliamentary election, should resign from parliament.&lt;ref&gt;http://zeenews.india.com/news/uttar-pradesh/kalyan-singhs-party-merges-with-bjp_824152.html&lt;/ref&gt; With an arrangement for over 8,000 at the rally, the [[BJP]] state leadership had been claiming that 50,000 people would be present, excluding 12,000 RKP workers, who too had joined the [[BJP]] along with their leader Rajveer Singh.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14503">[[Image:Kentoshi route.png|thumb|300px|right|Possible routes of embassy vessels to the Tang dynasty.]]

The '''Japanese missions to Imperial China''' were [[Foreign relations of Japan|diplomatic]] [[wikt:embassy|embassies]] which were intermittently sent to the Chinese court. Any distinction amongst diplomatic envoys sent from the Imperial Japanese court or from any of the Japanese shogunates was lost or rendered moot when the ambassador was received in the Chinese capital.

Extant records document missions to [[China]] between the years of 607 and 839 (a mission planned for 894 was cancelled). The composition of these Imperial missions included members of the [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] ''[[kuge]]'' and  [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[priests]]. These missions led to the importation of [[culture of China|Chinese culture]], including advances in the [[science]]s and [[technology]]. These diplomatic encounters produced the beginnings of a range of [[Schools of Buddhism]] in Japan, including [[Zen]].

From the [[Sinocentrism|sinocentric]] perspective of the Chinese Court in [[Chang'an]], the several embassies sent from Kyoto were construed as [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tributaries of Imperial China]]; but it is not clear that the Japanese shared this view.&lt;ref&gt;Yoda, Yoshiie ''et al.'' (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=97LTcTx8N98C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq= ''The Foundations of Japan's Modernization: a comparison with China's Path towards Modernization,'' pp. 40-41.]&lt;/ref&gt;

China seems to have taken the initiative in opening relations with [[Japan]]. [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] Emperor [[Emperor Yang of Sui|Yangdi]] dispatched a message in 605 which read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The sovereign of Sui respectfully inquires about the sovereign of [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]].&lt;ref&gt;Varley, Paul. (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court of [[Empress Suiko]] responded by sponsoring a mission led by [[Ono no Imoko]] in 607. A message carried by that mission, believed to have been written by [[Prince Shōtoku]], contains the earliest known written instance in which the Japanese archipelago is referred to by a term meaning "land of the rising sun."&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA40,M1 ''Annales des empereurs du japon,'' p. 40.]&lt;/ref&gt; The salutation read, in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the sovereign of the land of the rising sun (''hi izuru tokoro'') to the sovereign of the land of the setting sun."&lt;ref&gt;Varley, Paul. (1973). ''Japanese Culture: A Short History''. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The {{nihongo|Imperial embassies to the [[Sui dynasty]]|遣隋使|Kenzui-shi}} included representatives sent to study government and technology.

The {{nihongo|Imperial embassies to [[Tang dynasty]]|遣唐使|Kentō-shi}} are the best known; 19 missions were completed. A 20th mission had been planned for 894 (''[[Kanpyō (era)|Kanpyō]] 6, 8th month''), including the appointment of ambassadors. However, shortly before departure, the mission was halted by [[Emperor Uda]] because of reports of unsettled conditions in China.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA127,M1  pp. 127-128.]&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor's decision-making was influenced by the persuasive counsel of [[Sugawara no Michizane]].&lt;ref&gt;Kitagawa, Hiroshi. (1975). ''The Tale of the Heike,'' p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Envoys to the Sui court==
{{main|Japanese missions to Sui China}}

Japanese envoys to the Sui court were received as ambassadors:

*'''607''': The first diplomatic mission was led by Japan's first ambassador to China. This Japanese envoy, [[Ono no Imoko]], had the title ''kenzuishi''.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, "Kentōshi" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 511|page=511}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delegation was received in the Imperial Court.&lt;ref name="nussbaum"&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Ono no Imoko''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan encyclopedia,'' p. 755|page=755}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''608''': Ono no Imoko leads a returning embassy to China.&lt;ref name="nussbaum"/&gt; This mission included two others with the title ''kenzushi'': [[Takamuko no Kuromaro]] (no Genri)&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, "Takamuko no Kuromaro (No Genri)" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 935|page=935}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Minabuchi no Shōan]].&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, "Minabuchi no Shōan" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 632|page=632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuromaro and Shōan, along with the Buddhist monk Sōmin &lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, "Sōmin" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 900|page=900}}&lt;/ref&gt; remained in China for 32 years before returning to Japan.

==Envoys to the Tang court==
{{main|Japanese missions to Tang China}}

Japanese envoys to the Tang court were received as ambassadors:
Three missions to the Tang court were dispatched during the reign of [[Emperor Kōtoku]].&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). ''The Imperial House of Japan,'' p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Emperor Kanmu]]'s planned mission to the Tang court in 804 (''[[Enryaku]] 23'') included three ambassadors and several Buddhist priests, including {{nihongo|[[Saichō]]|最澄}} and {{nihongo|[[Kūkai]]|空海}}; but the enterprise was delayed until the end of the year. The ambassadors returned in the middle of 805 (''Enryaku 24, 6th month''). They were accompanied by the monk Saichō, also known by his posthumous name {{nihongo|Dengyō Daishi|伝教大師}}, whose teachings would develop into the [[Tendai]] school of Japanese Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA92,M1  pp. 92-94.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 806 (''[[Daidō]] 1, 8th month''), the return of the monk Kūkai, also known posthumously as {{nihongo|Kōbō-Daishi|弘法大師}}, marks the beginning of what would develop into the [[Shingon]] school of Japanese Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA96,M1  p. 96.]&lt;/ref&gt;

New ambassadors to China were appointed by [[Emperor Ninmyō]] in 834, but the mission was put off.  
*'''836–839''': The mission was postponed by a typhoon; but the ambassadors did eventually travel to the Tang court, returning in 839 with a letter from [[Emperor Tang Wenzong]].&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA108,M1  p. 108.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, a steady and conservative Confucianist [[Song dynasty]] emerged after the end of the Tang dynasty and subsequent period of disunity during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. During this time, although travel to China was generally safe, Japanese rulers believed there was little to learn from the Song, and so there were no major embassy missions to China.

===Adopting Tang models===
Ancient Japan was called [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]], which had a primitive culture when compared to [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] culture.{{cn|date=December 2017}} The Tang folks referred to [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] as 東夷 (Eastern barbarians).

From 630 onward, [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] sent large groups of monks, students and government officials, up to 600 each time, to the Tang capital of Chang'an to learn the then advanced production technology, social system, history, philosophy, arts and architecture.
Among many items adopted by [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]:

*Tang political system
*[[Heian-kyō]], the new Japanese capital established in 794, and was a laid out in a grid similar to that of Chang'an, the Tang capital.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Huaxia|Culture]], many Han Chinese characters (漢字) were borrowed from Tang civilization to build the Japanese culture.
*Tang dress codes (known today as Wafuku 和服), eating habits were the fashion which was imitated and popularized.

==Envoys to the Ming court==
{{main|Japanese missions to Ming China}}

Japanese envoys to the Ming court were received as ambassadors.&lt;ref name="mizuno109"&gt;Mizuno, Norihito. (2003). [http://www.chinajapan.org/articles/15/mizuno15.108-144.pdf ''China in Tokugawa Foreign Relations: The Tokugawa Bakufu’s Perception of and Attitudes toward Ming-Qing China,'' pp. 109-112.]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''1373-1406''' (''[[Ōan]] 6'' &amp;ndash; ''[[Ōei]] 13''): Embassies between China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, Joyce. (1982) ''Lessons from History: The "Tokushi Yoron",'' p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1397''' (''Ōei 4, 8th month''): an Imperial ambassador is dispatched from [[Emperor Go-Komatsu]] to the Ming Court.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP322&amp;dq= p. 322.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1401''' (''Ōei 8''): [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] sends a diplomatic mission to China as a tentative first step in re-initiating trade between [[Japan]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] [[China]]. The formal diplomatic letter conveyed to the Emperor of China was accompanied by a gift of 1000&amp;nbsp;ounces of gold and diverse objects.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP323&amp;dq= p. 323.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1402''' (''Ōei 9''): A letter from the [[Jianwen Emperor]] of China was received by Yoshimitsu; and this formal communication mistakenly accords the title "king of Japan" to the Japanese shōgun.&lt;ref name="titsingh324"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA324#v= p. 324.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Envoys to the Qing court==
{{main|Qing China}}

During Japan's self-imposed isolation in the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868), Japan's vicarious relationships with China evolved through the intermediary of the [[Kingdom of Ryukyu]]. Japan's view of external relations was ambivalent.&lt;ref name="mizuno109"/&gt;

*'''1853''' (''[[Kaei]] 6''): [[Hayashi Akira]] completed ''[[Tsūkō ichiran]]''. The work was created under orders from the bakufu to compile and edit documents pertaining to East Asian trade and diplomacy; and, for example, it includes a detailed description of a Ryukyuan tribute embassy to the [[Qing]] Chinese court in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;Smits, Gregory. (1999). ''Visions of Ryukyu: Identity and Ideology in Early-Modern Thought and Politics,'' p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |History}}
'''Jewish leadership''' ({{Lang-he|מנהיגות יהודית}}) has evolved over time.  Since the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of the Second Temple]] in
[[Jerusalem]] in 70 CE, there has been no single body that has a leadership position over the entire [[Jewish diaspora]]. Various branches of [[Judaism]], as well as Jewish religious or secular communities and political movements around the world elect or appoint their governing bodies, often subdivided by country or region

== Historic leadership ==

===Biblical leadership (before 70 CE)===
{{See also|List of Jewish Biblical figures}}
During the era of the [[Tanakh]], various forms of leadership developed. There were the heads of the original [[Hebrew tribe]]s, and then also [[Nevi'im|prophets]] such as [[Moses]], [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]] and [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] and whose words inspire people to this day, [[Biblical judges|judges]] such as [[Samson]], [[Books of Kings|kings]] such as [[David]] and [[Solomon]], [[Kohen|priests]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], and the [[Sanhedrin]] which was the [[judiciary]].

===Mishnaic, Talmudic, Middle Ages leadership (70 to 17th century)===
{{See also2|[[List of rabbis#Rabbits: Mishnaic (Tannaim)|Mishnaic rabbis]]; [[List of rabbis#Rabbis: Talmudic (Amoraim)|Talmudic rabbis]], [[List of rabbis#Rabbis: Middle Ages|Middle Ages rabbis]]}}
With the demise of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah]] and coinciding with the revolt of the [[Maccabees]] against [[ancient Greece]] and later [[Jewish-Roman wars]], the sages of the [[Mishnah]] and subsequently the [[Talmud]], referred to as the [[Oral Law]] in Judaism, took on a growing and central leadership role. After the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] and the subsequent exile for almost two thousand years, the Jews scattered throughout the world turned to their most learned [[rabbi]]s for local leadership and council.

During [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] against [[Roman Empire]] (132-135), the supreme religious authority [[Rabbi Akiva]] sanctioned [[Simon bar Kokhba]] to be a war leader, whereas during the 2nd century [[Judah haNasi]] was not only the supreme temporal leader sanctioned by Rome, but also edited the original work of the [[Mishnah]] which became the "de facto [[constitution]]" of the world's Jewry. The final editions of the [[Talmud]] became the core [[curriculum]] of the majority of Jews.

In [[Babylonia]] the [[Exilarch]] was almost always a rabbinical personality. The [[Geonim]] such as [[Saadia Gaon]] (892-942) were not only great sages but also political guides. The writings and rulings of those such as [[Rashi]] (1040–1105), [[Maimonides]] (1135–1204), [[Yosef Karo]] (1488–1575) who published the most widely accepted code of Jewish law the [[Shulkhan Arukh]], [[Isaac Luria]] (1534–1572), the [[Vilna Gaon]] (1720–1797), the [[Yisrael Meir Kagan|Chafetz Chaim]] (1838–1933) and many others have shaped [[Halakha|Jewish law]] for almost two thousand years, as their religious rulings were published, distributed, studied, and observed until the present time.

===Early modern leadership (18th and 19th centuries)===
{{See also2|[[List of rabbis#Rabbis: Later Middle Ages (Acharonim)|Rabbis of the Early Modern period]]}}
The loose collection of learned rabbis that governed the dispersed Jewish community held sway for a long time. Great parts of [[Central Europe]] accepted the leadership of the rabbinical [[Council of Four Lands]] from the 16th to the late 18th centuries. In the [[Eastern Europe]], in spite of the rivalry between the schools of thought of the Vilna Gaon (or the GRA, Rabbi [[Elijah ben Solomon]], 1720–1797) of the [[Mitnagdim]], who spoke against Hasidic Judaism and [[Baal Shem Tov]] (Rabbi [[Israel ben Eliezer]], 1700–1760), the founder of [[Hasidic Judaism]], rabbis were regarded as the final arbiters of community decisions. Tens of thousands of [[Responsa]] and many works were published and studied wherever Jews lived in organized communities. In [[Western Europe]], especially in monarchies, where no equal rights were granted for the Jewish population, radical [[Haskalah|Maskilim]] defined the new role of religion as an education of just citizens — like [[Moses Mendelssohn]] in his book ''[[Jerusalem (Mendelssohn)|Jerusalem or On Religious Power and Judaism]]'' which was a response to the Prussian reformer [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm]]. The radical tendency of the pedagogic movement went so far, that Mendelssohn's student [[David Friedländer]] identified Judaism with the seclusion of modern European culture and secular Judaism could end up in conversion to the religion of the unsecularized state. In contradiction to his teacher early modern leadership turned out to be misled leadership, whose followers ended up as "Jewish citizens without any conscience".

==Modern religious leadership (after 19th century)==

===Decline of rabbinical influence===
With the growth of the [[Renaissance]] and the development of the [[secular]] [[modern world]], and as Jews were welcomed into non-Jewish society particularly during the times of [[Napoleon]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, Jews began to leave the [[Ghetto#Jewish ghettos in Europe|Jewish ghettos in Europe]], and simultaneously rejected the traditional roles of the rabbis as communal and religious leaders. New leaders such as [[Israel Jacobson]], father of the German [[Reform Judaism]] movement, launched an egalitarian, modernist stance that challenged the Orthodoxy. The resulting fractures in Jewish society has translated into a situation whereby there is no single religious governing body for the entire Jewish community at the present time.

===Modern Synagogue leadership===
In individual religious congregations or [[synagogues]], the spiritual leader is generally the [[rabbi]].   Rabbis are expected to be taught in both the [[Talmud]] and the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' (Code of Jewish Law) as well as many other classical texts of Jewish scholarship. Rabbis go through formal training in Rabbinical texts and [[responsa]], either at a [[yeshiva]] or similar institution. "Rabbi" is not a universal term however, as many Sephardic rabbinic Jewish communities refer to their leaders as ''hakham'' ("wise man"). Among Yemenite Jews, known as ''Teimanim'', the term ''mori'' ("my teacher") is used.  Each religious tradition has its own qualifications for rabbis; for more information, see [[Semicha]] ("ordination"). In addition to the rabbi, most synagogues have a ''[[hazzan]]'' (cantor) who leads many parts of the [[Jewish services|prayer service]].

===Orthodox and Haredi rabbinic leadership===
{{See also2|[[List of rabbis#Orthodox rabbis|Orthodox rabbis]]}}
In Israel the office of [[Chief Rabbi]] &lt;/s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;has always been very influential. Various Orthodox movements, such as [[Agudath Israel of America]] and the [[Shas]] party in Israel strictly follow the rulings of their [[Rosh yeshiva]]s who are often famous Talmud scholars. The last [[Rebbe]] of [[Lubavitch]], Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the late Rabbi [[Elazar Menachem Shach]], and Rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]] in Israel are examples of powerful contemporary Haredi rabbis. The [[Haredi Agudah]] movements receive and follow the policy guidelines of their own ''[[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah|Council of Torah Sages]]''. In the [[Hassidic]] movements, leadership is usually hereditary.

===Reform, Progressive, Liberal, Conservative, and Reconstructionist leadership===
:''Main articles: [[List of rabbis#Conservative rabbis|Conservative rabbis]], [[List of rabbis#Reform rabbis|Reform rabbis]], [[List of rabbis#Reconstructionist rabbis|Reconstructionist rabbis]]''
In both the Reform and Conservative of Judaism, rabbis are often trained at religious universities, such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] in New York City for the Conservative movement, [[Hebrew Union College]] for the American Reform movement, and [[Leo Baeck College]] for the UK Liberal and Reform Movements. The Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist traditions each have their own governing group or individual leaders. Membership in these governing groups are selected by representatives of the Jewish community they serve, with Jewish scholarship considered to be the key factors for determining leaders.  These governing bodies make decisions on the nature of religious practice within their tradition, as well as ordaining and assigning [[rabbis]] and other religious leaders.

The Union of Reform Judaism (URJ), the synagogue arm of the Reform Movement in North America, is governed by a 253-member Board of Trustees in close partnership with URJ Chair Daryl Messinger, URJ President Rabbi Rick Jacobs, and the senior leadership team. Delegates from URJ congregations meet once every two years for the URJ General Assembly to pass resolutions that guide the organization’s future direction. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://urj.org/urj-leadership-governance|title=URJ Leadership &amp; Governance|author=|date=5 March 2014|website=urj.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of Conservative rabbis is the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], which maintains a [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]]. The body of Reform rabbis is the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]].

==Secular leadership==
Following the [[Renaissance]] and the [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in [[Europe]] (with its Jewish "extension" the [[Haskalah]] movement, which led to much modern-day assimilation into the cultures of their native countries), the variety of Jewish practice grew, with a widespread adoption of [[secular]] [[values]] and life-styles. Many modern Jewish communities are served by a variety of secular organizations at the local, national, and international levels.  These organizations have no official role in religious life, but often play an important part in the Jewish community.  Most of the largest groups, such as [[Hadassah]] and the [http://www.ujc.org/ United Jewish Communities], have an elected leadership.  No one secular group represents the entire Jewish community, and there is often significant internal debate among Jews about the stances these organizations take on affairs dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, such as antisemitism and Israeli policies.

In the United States and Canada today, the mainly secular [[United Jewish Communities]] (UJC), formerly known as the [[United Jewish Appeal]] (UJA), represents over 150 [[Jewish Federations]] and 400 independent communities across [[North America]]. Every major American city has its local "Jewish Federation", and many have sophisticated community centers and provide services, mainly health care-related. They raise record sums of money for [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] and [[humanitarian]] causes in North America and Israel. Additional local organizations include Jewish Family Services, Jewish nursing homes and Jewish community foundations.  Other organizations such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[American Jewish Congress]], [[American Jewish Committee]], and the [[B'nai B'rith]] represent different segments of the American Jewish community on a variety of issues.

==Karaite leadership==
A [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] synagogue is run by a board of directors, and its spiritual leader is often called a ''Hakham'', the equivalent of a "rabbi", and matches one in function. The ''Gabbai'' is the treasurer, the ''Shammash'' is the custodian, the ''Hazzan'' leads prayers, and in some the ''Ba'al Qeri'ah'' leads in the reading of the Torah. In America, Karaites are represented by ''the Karaite Jews of America'', and in Israel they are represented.

'''John Preston Davis''' (January 19, 1905 &amp;ndash; September 11, 1973) was an American journalist, lawyer and activist intellectual, who became prominent for his work with the [[Joint Committee on National Recovery]]. He co-founded the [[National Negro Congress]] in 1935, which was affiliated with the Communist Party of America.

He founded ''Our World'' magazine in 1946, a full-size, nationally distributed magazine edited for African-American readers. He also published the ''American Negro Reference Book,'' covering virtually every aspect of African-American life, present and past.

==Biography==
John P. Davis was born in Washington, D.C., the son of [[Dr. William Henry Davis]] and Julia Davis. His father was a graduate of [[Howard University]] and served as principal of Armstrong High School. During [[World War I]], Dr. Davis was appointed as Secretary to Dr. [[Emmett Jay Scott]], Special Assistant to the [[United States Secretary of War]]. In the 1920s, Dr. Davis served as Secretary to the Presidential Commission investigating the economic conditions in the [[Virgin Islands]].

==The early years==
Davis attended segregated schools in Washington, D.C., graduating from the elite Dunbar High School, which stressed an academic curriculum. In 1922 he enrolled in [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. He graduated in 1926, earning an A.B. and double honors in English and Psychology. At Bates, Davis was president of [[Delta Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha#Delta Sigma Rho|Delta Sigma Rho]], an honorary debating fraternity, and editor of the student publication ''The Bobcat''.

Davis toured Europe with the Bates College debating team. He was among the first African-American men to be sent overseas under the auspices of the American University Union to engage in international debate; his team from Bates met and defeated Cambridge University. While he was an undergraduate at Bates College, Davis was nominated for a [[Rhodes scholarship]]. He contributed short stories to the magazines, ''[[The Crisis]]'' and ''Opportunity,'' published by the [[NAACP]].
 
With his literary interests, Davis was drawn into the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. After college, he moved to New York City, where for a time, he replaced the celebrated scholar [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] as literary editor of ''The Crisis''. During this period, Davis joined with other young black writers &amp;ndash; [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Gwendolyn Bennett]], [[Wallace Thurman]], [[Aaron Douglas]], [[Richard Bruce Nugent|Richard Bruce]] &amp;ndash; to produce ''[[Fire!!]]'', a magazine devoted to young African-American artists.

==Harvard University==
Davis had a fellowship to Harvard University from 1926 to 1927, and earned his master's degree in Journalism. He left Harvard to join the staff of [[Fisk University]], a [[historically black college]] in Nashville, where he served as Director of Publicity from (1927 to 1928). He returned to [[Harvard University]] and earned an LLB degree from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1933.

At Harvard, Davis cemented lifelong friendships with a small core of black students, including fellow Dunbar High School alumni [[Robert C. Weaver]], later appointed as the first black member of a Presidential cabinet; [[William H. Hastie|William Hastie]], later appointed as the first black federal judge; and [[Ralph Bunche]], later a statesman and diplomat who was awarded a [[Nobel Prize for Peace]].

These friends remained important throughout his career. During their student years, the men discussed race and politics, especially the inadequacy of the black Republican leadership. When the [[Great Depression]] intensified the social and economic problems confronting black America, Davis and his colleagues looked to the example of Reconstruction, when federal power was used to redress the plight of former slaves. They called on the federal government to ensure black civil and political rights. The [[New Deal]] of Franklin D. Roosevelt seemed to offer the possibility of federal intervention for economic justice.

==Marriage and family==
Davis married Marguerite DeMond, the daughter of [[Reverend Abraham Lincoln DeMond]] and Lula Watkins (Patterson) DeMond. She had attended Avery Normal Institute in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], operated by the [[American Missionary Association]] and the Congregationalist Church. Even before the Civil War, Avery Normal Institute's racially integrated faculty was providing quality educations for African Americans. She attended [[Syracuse University]] in 1931 and came to Washington, D.C., with her mother in 1932, after the death of her father.

Marguerite DeMond went to work as a researcher for African-American historian [[Carter G. Woodson]]'s [[Association for the Study of African American Life and History]]. After a one-year courtship, she and Davis were married. They had four children, including [[Michael DeMond Davis]], who became a journalist who authored Black American Women in Olympic track and Field and the [[Thurgood Marshall]] biography.

==Joint Committee for National Recovery==
In the summer of 1933 John P. Davis, a law graduate, and Robert C. Weaver, a doctoral student at Harvard, acted to ensure that African-American interests were represented in government programs. The two men returned to Washington, D.C. and established an office on Capitol Hill, where they fought successfully against the racial wage differential and for the integration of Negro families into the program of the Homestead Subsistence Division in the first recovery program.

Davis and Weaver organized the [[Negro Industrial League]] to pressure New Deal agencies to address the needs of blacks. They monitored the hearings of the [[National Recovery Administration]] to ensure that blacks benefited from the program.

Their efforts led to the establishment of the [[Joint Committee on National Recovery]], a group of twenty-six national groups, including the [[YWCA]], [[National Urban League]] (NUL), and the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). Davis became Executive Secretary of the JCNR, a position he held until 1936, serving as a legislative lobbyist. The committee lobbied for fair inclusion of African Americans in government-sponsored programs. It publicized incidents and patterns of racial discrimination. The implementation of a National Recovery Program promised to have immediate and long-term consequences for African Americans. While Davis and Weaver worked, more established African-American leaders deliberated about how to respond to the flurry of New Deal legislation.

==National Negro Congress==
In May 1935 a conference on the economic status of the Negro was held at [[Howard University]] in Washington, D.C., out of which emerged a major civil rights coalition that was active in the late 1930s and 1940s. The National Negro Congress—whose sponsors included Davis, [[Ralph J. Bunche]] and [[Alain Locke]] of Howard University, [[A. Philip Randolph]] of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]], [[James W. Ford|James Ford]] of the [[Communist Party]], [[Lester Granger]] and Elmer Carter of the Urban League, and [[Charles Hamilton Houston]] of the NAACP—was significant in two respects.&lt;!--what two?--&gt; Davis was one of the original founders; he served as Executive Secretary until 1942.

The NNC represented one of the first efforts of the 20th century to bring together under one umbrella black secular leaders, preachers, labor organizers, workers, businessmen, radicals, and professional politicians, with the assumption that the common denominator of race could weld together such divergent segments of black society. It was the Communist Party’s effort to build support among activists in the black mainstream. The evolution of the [[National Negro Congress]] dramatized the growing convergence of outlook between Communists and activist black intellectuals that had taken shape in the protests of the early Depression years and reached full fruition during the years of the [[Popular Front]].

In 1943 Davis brought the first lawsuit challenging segregated schools in Washington, D.C., in the name of his five-year-old son Michael D. Davis, who was rejected from his neighborhood's Noyes School, a white elementary school. The ''Washington Star'' criticized the African-American lawyer for legally challenging the District's dual segregated school system after the principal of Noyes School refused to admit Mike Davis. The ''Washington Star'' paper said that District citizens had long accepted separate schools for blacks and whites, and that the suit brought by John P. Davis would cause deeper racial divisions in the nation's capital.

In response to Davis' suit, the US Congress appropriated federal funds to construct the Lucy D. Slowe elementary school, for African-American children, directly across the street from his [[Brookland, Washington, D.C.|Brookland]] neighborhood home. At that time, a committee of Congress directly administered District government.

==''Our World'' magazine==
After World War II, in 1946 Davis was founding publisher of ''Our World'' magazine, a full-size, nationally distributed magazine to appeal to African-American readers. Its first issue, with singer-actress [[Lena Horne]] on the cover, appeared on the nation's newsstands in April 1946. ''Our World'' was a premier publication, covering contemporary topics from black history to sports and entertainment, with regular articles on health, fashion, politics and social awareness. It was based in New York City, the publishing capital of the country.

''Our World'' portrayed a thriving black America; its covers featured entertainers such as [[Lena Horne]], [[Marian Anderson]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Nat King Cole]].

==''The American Negro Reference Book''==
In 1964 Davis served as editor of special publications for the [[Phelps-Stokes Fund]]. He compiled in a single volume a reliable summary on the main aspects of Negro life in America, presenting it with historical depth to provide the reader with a true perspective. ''The American Negro Reference Book'' covered virtually every aspect of African-American life, present and past.

==Papers and collections==
The largest collection of Davis' papers is in the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]], [[New York Public Library]]. Insight into Davis' political and social views can be found in his own writings. ''The Papers of the National Negro Congress'' reproduces all of the organization’s records that are housed at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, including the voluminous working files of Davis and successive executive secretaries of the National Negro Congress. Beginning with papers from 1933 that predate the formation of the National Negro Congress, the wide-ranging collection documents Davis’ involvement in the Negro Industrial League. It includes the "Report Files" of Davis’ interest in the "Negro problem."

The most extensive overview of Davis' life is by Hilmar Jenson in an edition of his writings, John Preston Davis, ''The Forgotten Civil Rights'' (1996). Much of the scholarly writing about Davis focuses on his experiences in the National Negro Congress.

Artifacts and papers of Davis are being acquired by the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.

'''Karbi Longri N.C. Hills Liberation Front''' is a militant group operating in [[Karbi Anglong district]] and [[Dima Hasao district]] (formerly known as the North Cachar Hills district) of [[Assam]], [[India]]. Thong Teron is the general secretary of KLNLF. Karbi Anglong NC Hills People's Resistance is the armed wing of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nagalandpage.co.in/7.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710062133/http://www.nagalandpage.co.in/7.html |date=10 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; KLNLF emerged from the [[United People's Democratic Solidarity]], being the anti-peace talks faction of UDPS. After the split, there has been turf wars between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/2004/09/15/stories/2004091506321200.htm|newspaper=The Hindu | title=National : Karbi militants call for strike|date=15 September 2004|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, the Assam government estimated that KLNLF had a membership of 225.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/web1/08july19/national.htm ''DailyExcelsior''].{{dead link|date=May 2015}} {{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; KLNLF is closely linked to the [[United Liberation Front of Asom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-usual-suspects/379545/|title=THE USUAL SUSPECTS|publisher=Indianexpress.com|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The outfit claims to fight for the cause of [[Karbi people|Karbi]] tribes and its declared objective is Hemprek Kangthim, meaning self-rule/self-determination of the [[Karbi people]].

==Leadership, cadre and area of operation==
Pradip Terang alias Pongbi Dilli is the ‘Chairman’ of the outfit. Har Sing Timung was the General Secretary till 2 January 2005, when he resigned from his position following serious differences with the ‘Commander-in-Chief’ Men Sing Takbi alias Willingson Timung. Laden Ronghang is the ‘Publicity Secretary’ of the group and ‘Incharge Central Publicity Cell’ is Thong Teron alias Rupsing Teron. The Assistant Foreign Secretary/ Revenue/Finance/Taxation of the outfit is Biren Lekthe alias Risso Tokbi.

Currently, the outfit has around 200 cadres operating in the [[Karbi Anglong district]]. The KLNLF Commander-in-Chief, Willingson Timung, was killed along with two other cadres by the General Secretary, Hor Sing Timung, on 2 February 2005. Later on 29 April 2005, Hor Sing Timung along with other four associates was executed by the outfit at a camp in [[Bangladesh]] for their involvement in the murder of Timung.

While the group’s stronghold is the [[Karbi Anglong district]], its presence has also been reported from [[Dima Hasao district|Dima Hasao]] and [[Nagaon district|Nagaon]] districts.

==Linkage==
The outfit maintains close links with the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA). The ULFA’s ‘709th battalion’ operates out of two major bases in Karbi Anglong, with the KLNLF providing it with logistic support in return for weapons and ammunition.

It also reportedly has links with the Nagaland-based [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] - Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM). On 11 May 2004, 31 KLNLF cadres along with five NSCN-IM militants were arrested from a bus on the Paren-Ghaspani Road on their way to [[Dimapur]]. These cadres had undergone training at a NSCN-IM camp and were reportedly part of the recent batch that passed out from there. On 13 October 2007, security forces neutralized a joint camp of the NSCN-IM and KLNLF inside Kaki Reserve Forest area in the [[Karbi Anglong district]].

==Funds==
Abductions for ransom and extortion are the main sources of funds for the group. According to official sources, the outfit generates a considerable amount of revenue by targeting the ginger producing [[Kuki people|Kukis]] in the Singhason Hills area. The non-Karbi Hindi – speaking traders are also targeted for extortion. In some case, even the [[Karbi people|Karbi]]s are targeted for extortion.

A '''land patent''' is an exclusive [[land grant]] made by a sovereign entity with respect to a particular [[wikt:tract|tract]] of land. To make such a grant "patent", a sovereign (proprietary landowner) must document the land grant, securely sign and seal the document (patent), and openly publish the documents for the public to see. An official land patent is the highest evidence of [[right]], [[Title (property)|title]], and interest to a defined area. It is usually granted by a [[central government|central]], [[Federal government|federal]], or [[state government]] to an individual or to a private company.

Besides ''[[patent]]'', other terms for the certificate that grants such rights include ''first-title deed'' and ''final certificate''. In the [[United States]], all claims of land ownership can be traced back to a land patent, first-title [[deed]], or similar document regarding land originally owned by [[France]], [[Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], or [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].

A land patent is known in law as "[[letters patent]]", and usually issues to the original grantee and to their [[heir]]s and [[assigns]] forever. The patent stands as supreme title to the land because it attests that all evidence of title existent before its issue date was reviewed by the sovereign authority under which it was sealed and was so sealed as irrefutable; thus, at law the land patent itself so becomes the title to the land defined within its four corners.

==History of land patents in the United States of America==
Land in the United States of America was acquired by annexation, purchase, treaty or war from  [[France]], [[Great Britain]],  the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]] and the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples.

As [[Kingdom of England|England]], later to become Great Britain, began to colonize [[colonial America|America]], [[the Crown]] made large grants of territory to individuals and companies. In turn, those companies and colonial governors later made smaller grants of land based on actual surveys of the land. Thus, in colonial America on the [[Atlantic seaboard]], a connection was made between the surveying of a land tract and its "patenting" as [[private property]].

Many original colonies' land patents came from the corresponding country of control (e.g., Great Britain). Most such patents were permanently granted. Those patents are still in force; the [[United States government]] honors those patents by treaty law, and, as with all such land patents, they cannot be changed.

After the [[American Revolution]] and the ratification of the [[Constitution of the United States]], the [[United States Treasury Department]] was placed in charge of managing all public lands. In 1812, the [[General Land Office]] was created to assume that duty.

In accord with specific Acts of Congress, and under the hand and seal of the President of the United States of America, the General Land Office issued more than 2 million land grants made patent (land patents), passing the title of specific parcels of public land from the nation to private parties (individuals or private companies). Some of the land so granted had survey or other costs associated with it. Some patentees paid those fees for their land in cash, others [[Homestead principle|homesteaded]] a claim, and still others came into ownership via one of the many donation acts that Congress passed to transfer public lands to private ownership. Whatever the method, the General Land Office followed a two-step procedure in granting a patent.

First, the private claimant went to the land office in the land district where the public land was located. The claimant filled out entry papers to select the public land, and the land office register (clerk) checked the local registrar records to make sure the claimed land was still available. The receiver (bursar) took the claimant's payment, because even homesteaders had to pay administrative fees.

Next, the district land office register and receiver sent the paperwork to the General Land Office in Washington. That office double-checked the accuracy of the claim, its availability and the form of payment. Finally, the General Land Office issued a land patent for the claimed public land and sent it on to the President for his signature.

The first United States land patent was issued on March 4, 1788, to John Martin.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, General Land Office Records&lt;/ref&gt; That patent reserves to the United States one third of all [[gold]], [[silver]], [[lead (metal)|lead]] and [[copper]] within the claimed land.

[[File:STA Patent OH0030.411.PDF|thumb|A land patent for a {{convert|39.44|acre|adj=on}} land parcel in present-day [[Monroe County, Ohio]] and within the [[Seven Ranges]] land tract. The parcel was sold by the Marietta Land Office in [[Marietta, Ohio]] in 1834.]]
Usage restrictions (e.g., oil and mineral rights, roadways, ditches and canals) placed on the land are spelled out in the patent. Such private property rights can also be thereafter negotiated in accord with the terms of private contracts. The rights inherent in patented land are carried from heir to heir, heir to assignee, or assignee to assignee, and cannot be changed except by private contract ([[warranty deed]], [[quitclaim deed]], etc.). In most cases, the law of a particular piece of patented land will be governed by the Congressional Act or treaty under which it was acquired, or by terms spelled out in the patent. For example, in the United States the laws governing the land may involve the [[Homestead Act]] or reservations placed on the face of the patent, or the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which governs certain jurisdictional dicta relating to large amounts of land in California and adjoining territories.

Because most people become familiar with land rights only when they acquire real estate either by inheritance or through the process of a purchase contract, they never learn the difference between land and the property [[Appurtenance|appurtenant]] to it. Accordingly, their familiarity with land law remains virtually non-existent; and, they only become accustomed to State statutory regulations relative to the property appurtenant to the land, that is to say: property taxing, zoning and building codes, etc.

==Former U.S. territories==
When a [[Territories of the United States|territory]] agreed to enter the Union of the United States of America, an [[Enabling act (United States)|Enabling Act]] was agreed to as a [[condition precedent]] of statehood. The Enabling Act requires that all unappropriated (not yet privately owned) lands be forever disclaimed by the territory and the people of the territory, and the title ceded to the United States for its disposition.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Republic of Texas]], however, retained its unappropriated lands, and [[Hawaii]] was a conquered territory.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the enabling act of the [[Washington Territory]] declares, in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... that the people inhabiting said proposed States do agree and declare that they forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying within the boundaries thereof, and to all lands lying within said limits owned or held by any Indian or Indian tribes; and that until the title thereto shall have been extinguished by the United States, the same shall be and remain subject to the disposition of the United States. ..&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the right and title to land was disclaimed by the people of the territory, it was held in trust by the United States until someone proved a claim to it, typically by [[Homestead (buildings)|improving the homestead]] parcel for a certain period of time. Once a proper claim has been filed, the [[General Land Office]] (now the [[Bureau of Land Management]]) certifies that the claimant has paid for a survey, as well as depositing another sum of money. Then, pursuant to the various land acts of Congress, the land is granted to the private owner by letters patent under the signature and [[Seal of the President of the United States|seal]] of the [[President of the United States of America]].

==Miscellaneous==
Legal entities other than natural persons (such as trusts and corporations) cannot obtain land patents except by express act of the [[United States Congress]]. An example of Congress granting land through patents to corprate entities is the railroad grants made to compensate the railroad companies for building railroads across America.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

All versions of the declaration, which opposes [[global warming]] and the [[Kyoto Protocol]], were penned by [[Fred Singer]]'s [[Science and Environmental Policy Project]] (SEPP).

The first declaration was based on a November 9–10, 1995 conference, organized by [[Helmut Metzner]] in [[Leipzig, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021218065426/http://www.sepp.org/weekwas/1999/Dec25.htm |title=Obituary in "The Week That Was|date=25 Dec 1999 |publisher=SEPP |url=http://www.sepp.org/weekwas/1999/Dec25.htm |archivedate=2002-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second declaration was additionally based on a successor conference in [[Bonn, Germany]] on November 10–11, 1997. The conferences were cosponsored by SEPP and the [[European Academy for Environmental Affairs]] and titled ''International Symposium on the Greenhouse Controversy''.

Today, the declaration is regarded as [[disinformation]] campaign, exercised by the [[Climate change denial|climate change denial movement]] using the fake-expert-strategy, to [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|cast doubt]] on the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scienctific consensus about global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;John Cook et al: ''Neutralizing misinformation through inoculation: Exposing misleading argumentation techniques reduces their influence''.

== Versions ==
=== The 1995 Declaration ===

The 1995 declaration asserts: "There does not exist today a general scientific consensus about the importance of greenhouse warming from rising levels of carbon dioxide. On the contrary, most scientists now accept the fact that actual observations from earth satellites show no climate warming whatsoever." The latter statement was broadly accurate at the time, but with additional data and correction of errors, all analyses of [[satellite temperature measurements]] now show statistically significant warming.

The declaration also criticised the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], saying: "Energy is essential for all economic growth, and fossil fuels provide today's principal global energy source. In a world in which poverty is the greatest social pollutant, any restriction on energy use that inhibits economic growth should be viewed with caution. For this reason, we consider 'carbon taxes' and other drastic control policies ... to be ill-advised, premature, wrought with economic danger, and likely to be counterproductive."

==== Signatures ====

According to the SEPP website, there were 79 signatures to the 1995 declaration, including [[Frederick Seitz]]: the current SEPP chair. Perhaps the most prominent signatory to the declaration was Dr. Robert E. Stevenson, a former research scientist for [[NASA]] and the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/StevensonRE/RES_BIO.pdf |title=NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, Biographical Data Sheet, Name: Robert E. Stevenson |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The signature list was last updated on July 16, 1996. Of these 79, 33 failed to respond when SEPP asked them to sign the 1997 declaration. SEPP calls the signatories "nearly 100 climate experts".

The signatures to the 1995 declaration were disputed by David Olinger of the ''St. Petersburg Times''. In an article on July 29, 1996, he revealed that many signers, including [[Chauncey Starr]], [[Robert Balling]], and [[Patrick Michaels]], have received funding from the oil industry, while others had no scientific training or could not be identified.&lt;ref name=Olinger&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/22741240.html?dids=22741240:22741240&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jul+29%2C+1996&amp;author=DAVID+OLINGER&amp;pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1.A&amp;desc=Cool+to+the+warnings+of+global+warming%27s+dangers+Series%3A+COLUMN+ONE |title=Cool to the warnings of global warming's dangers|last=Olinger |first=David |publisher=St. Petersburg Times |date=July 29, 1996}} (paywall)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 declarations begins: "As scientists, we are intensely interested in the possibility that human activities may affect the global climate". However, those identified as scientists and climate experts include at least ten weather presenters, including Dick Groeber of Dick's Weather Service in [[Springfield, Ohio]]. Groeber, who had not completed a university degree, labelled himself a scientist by virtue of his thirty to forty years of self-study.&lt;ref name=Olinger/&gt;

In any case, it is difficult to accurately evaluate the list of signatures of the 1995 declaration, as the SEPP website provides no additional details about them except for their university, if they are professors.

=== The 1997 Declaration ===

The 1997 declaration updated the 1995 declaration in a number of ways. The most obvious difference was its focus on the [[Kyoto Protocol]], as the Kyoto conference was in the process of being finalised. The declaration says:

: "We believe the Kyoto Protocol -- to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only part of the world community -- is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living.  ... We consider the drastic emission control policies deriving from the Kyoto conference -- lacking credible support from the underlying science -- to be ill-advised and premature."

The 1997 declaration also updated its citations of evidence that appeared to run contrary to the consensus on global warming. For example, the 1995 declaration cites "observations from earth satellites," where the 1997 declaration cites "observations from both weather satellites and balloon-borne radiosondes." As with satellite data, subsequent analysis of [[Satellite temperature measurements#Weather balloons (radiosondes)|radiosondes]] has shown{{Fact|date=September 2011}} a statistically significant warming trend.

==== Signatures ====

The declaration begins: "As independent scientists concerned with atmospheric and climate problems, we...". As with the 1995 declaration, questions have been raised about the scientific background of the signers, and others have questioned the degree to which they can be deemed to be independent. Because many of those who signed the 1997 declaration also signed the 1995 declaration, the concerns raised by David Olinger and others after the 1995 declaration are still relevant.

The signers are generally described by Fred Singer and his supporters as climate scientists, although the current signers also include 25 weather presenters. One key report opposing the scientific credentials of the signers was a Danish Broadcasting Company TV special by Øjvind Hesselager.&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naturalscience.com/ns/letters/ns_let08.html |title=How many climate researchers support the 'Leipzig Declaration'? |first=Christian |last=Jensen |publisher=naturalSCIENCE |date=11 February 1998 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hesselager attempted to contact the declaration's 33 European signers and found that four of them could not be located, twelve denied ever having signed, and some had not even heard of the Leipzig Declaration. Those who verified signing included a medical doctor, a nuclear scientist, and an [[entomologist]]. After discounting the signers whose credentials were inflated, irrelevant, false, or unverifiable, Hesselager claimed that only 20 of the names on the list had any scientific connection with the study of climate change, and some of those names were known to have obtained grants from the oil and fuel industry, including the German coal industry and the government of Kuwait (a major oil exporter). As a result of Hesselager's report, Singer removed some, but not all, of the discredited signatures. The number of signatures on the document, according to SEPP's own press releases, has declined from 140 (according to a December 1997 press release) to 105 ({{As of|2003|alt=as of February 2003}}).

SEPP's position is that "a few of the original signers did not have the 'proper' academic credentials - even though they understand the scientific climate issues quite well. To avoid this kind of smear, we want to restrict the Leipzig Declaration to signers with impeccable qualifications." To address the signer credibility issue, SEPP has provided considerably more information about each signer on their website and lists the weather presenters separately from the other signers.

=== 2005, revised ===
As of 2010, Singer's SEPP website listed the "2005, revised" declaration (which still spoke of the 1997 Kyoto conference as a future event).&lt;ref name=dec2005/&gt; This version included the claim: "In fact, many climate specialists now agree that actual observations from weather satellites show no global warming whatsoever".

The declarations have been widely cited by some in the "[[sound science]]" movement. It has been cited by [[Fred Singer]] in editorial columns appearing in hundreds of websites and major publications, including ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Miami Herald]]'', ''[[Detroit News]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'', ''[[Memphis Commercial Appeal]]'', ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', and ''[[The Orange County Register]]''. [[Jeff Jacoby (columnist)|Jeff Jacoby]], a columnist with the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', described the signers of the Leipzig Declaration as "climate scientists" that "include prominent scholars."  Think tanks such as [[The Heritage Foundation]], [[The Heartland Institute]], and Australia's [[Institute of Public Affairs|Institute for Public Affairs]] called them "noted scientists." Both the Leipzig Declaration and [[Frederick Seitz]]'s [[Oregon Petition]] have been quoted as authoritative sources during deliberations in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.

Although the key data on which the Leipzig declaration relied (such as [[satellite temperature measurements]]) has been invalidated by subsequent research, and much new evidence has accumulated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Summary for Policy Makers |publisher=[[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] (4AR) |url=http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/docs/WG1AR4_SPM_Approved_05Feb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the declaration continues to be cited, along with the Oregon Petition, as evidence of the current views of scientists on climate change.  Moreover, the organizers have not changed their stated position of rejecting anthropogenic global warming.

This is a '''list of Owenite communities in the United States''' which emerged during a short-lived popular [[boom and bust|boom]] during the second half of the 1820s. Between 1825 and 1830 more than a dozen such colonies were established in the United States, inspired by the ideas of [[Robert Owen]]. All of these met with economic failure and rapid disestablishment within one or a comparatively few years.

The Owenite movement of the 1820s was one of the four primary branches of [[secular]] [[Utopian Socialism]] in the United States during the 19th century, antedating [[List of Fourierist Associations in the United States|Fourierism]] (1843–50), [[Icarians|Icarianism]] (1848–98) and [[Nationalist Clubs|Bellamyism]] (1889–96).

==Background==
[[File:NewHarmony.jpg|thumb|right|250px|New Harmony, Indiana as it actually appeared, circa 1832.]]

The [[communitarianism|communitarian]] ideas of Welsh reformer [[Robert Owen]] (1772–1837) were popularized in the United States by his arrival in America in November 1824. Owen had learned that an already established [[Rappite]] religious community at [[Harmony, Indiana]] was for sale and set sail for America with a view acquiring it from the [[Harmony Society]] and thereby making it a model for his collectivist plans.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Hillquit, [https://archive.org/details/historyofsociali00hilluoft ''History of Socialism in the United States.''] [1903] Revised Fifth Edition. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1910; pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This initial American community of Owen, a tract of 30,000 acres on the [[Wabash River]] which included farmland, dwellings, and factories, would be rechristened "New Harmony" and served as the inspiration for the establishment of other Owenite colonies.&lt;ref name=Hillquit58&gt;Hillquit, ''History of Socialism in the United States,'' pg. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of Owenite communities in the United States was boosted by two widely publicized addresses by Owen made before the [[United States Congress]], dated February 25 and March 7, 1825.&lt;ref&gt;T.D. Seymour Bassett, "The Secular Utopian Socialists," in Donald Drew Egbert and Stow Persons (eds.), ''Socialism and American Life: Volume 1.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1952; pg. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The assembled audience included President [[John Quincy Adams]], several members of his cabinet, the justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and a number of other invited luminaries.&lt;ref&gt;George B. Lockwood with Charles A. Prosser, [https://archive.org/details/newharmonymoveme00lock ''The New Harmony Movement.''] New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1905; pg. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen was assisted in his development of New Harmony by Philadelphian [[William Maclure]], himself a wealthy [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] as well as the leading American [[geology|geologist]] of the day.&lt;ref name=Hillquit58 /&gt; Other leading American intellectuals directly participated in the project, including preeminent [[zoology|zoologist]] [[Thomas Say]], painter [[Charles Alexandre Lesueur]], visionary pedagogue [[Francis Neef]], and Scottish-born feminist and freethinker [[Frances Wright|Frances "Fanny" Wright]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Hillquite, ''History of Socialism in the United States,'' pg. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

A brief fad followed seeking the realization of Owen's ideas in practice, resulting in the formation of over a dozen Owenite communities. All of these proved short-lived, whether owing to internal dissension or an inability to generate a surplus producing manufactured goods and agricultural products sufficient to retire debts incurred. By about 1830 the Owenite movement in America had vanished with little trace, the established village of New Harmony having long since converted to operation on an [[individualism|individualistic]] basis.

{{Politics of Malaysia}}

The '''Malaysian Indian Muslim Congress''' ('''MIMC'''; {{lang-ms|Kongres India Muslim Malaysia}}, ''KIMMA'') is a [[political party]] formed on 24 October 1976 to represent the interests of the minority [[Indian Muslim]] community in [[Malaysia]]. KIMMA was deregistered twice ever in 1978 and 1998 before it was successfully registered back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usj.com.my/bulletin/upload/showpost.php?p=91542&amp;postcount=14 Indian based political parties, Bob Kee]&lt;/ref&gt; Majority members of KIMMA are Indian Muslim.

==Political Affiliation==
KIMMA had joined the opposition political parties coalitions [[Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah]] (APU) and [[Gagasan Rakyat]] (GR) simultaneously before from 1990 to 1996. KIMMA somehow changed its direction after that and declared that it have wish to join [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) since 1984. Due to the coalition constitution which stated all new application will have to be agreed unanimously by all the component parties, it faced the obstacles especially from [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] (MIC) and [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) as there may be double-membership in the parties. KIMMA application gets a big objection from MIC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2008&amp;dt=0715&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Terkini&amp;pg=bt_08.htm Samy Vellu halang KIMMA sertai BN, 15/07/2008, Utusan Malaysia]&lt;/ref&gt; The concern and doubt over the status of Malaysian Indian Muslim as Non-Malay and Non-Bumiputra which are also obstacles and objections that have made KIMMA willing to passed the motion to demand the Malay status for its community and to apply for KIMMA to be accepted as an associated member of UMNO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maverickysm.blogspot.com/2005/09/kimma-seeks-malay-status-for-indian.html Kimma seeks Malay status for Indian Muslims, 25 September 2005, Cakap Tak Serupa Bikin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianmalaysian.com/sound/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=977 IPF To Support BN Candidates In General Election - Pandithan, 31 December 2007, Bernama]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership Crisis==
In 2008, KIMMA went through a leadership crisis when its  earlier sacked deputy president, Amir Amsa Alla Pitchay by it president Dato' Syed Ibrahim B. Kader, claimed himself is the president and suggested the merger of KIMMA with [[People's Progressive Party (Malaysia)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP), another BN component party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/2/5/nation/20237702&amp;sec=nation No talks, says the real Kimma head, 5 February 2008, The Star] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101130206/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F2%2F5%2Fnation%2F20237702&amp;sec=nation |date=1 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 once again the internal crisis saw KIMMA faced with problem of 2 presidents after the
validity of the 33th Annual General Meeting was in doubt and Federal Territory KIMMA president, Mohd Fazil William Abdullah was sacked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mt.m2day.org/2008/content/view/22698/84/ Crisis within Malaysian Indian Muslim Congress, 03 June 2009, Bernama]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/108228 Kimma: Pecat Mohd Fazil ikut perlembagaan, Abdul Rahim Sabri, 10 Jul 2009, Malaysiakini]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/108155 Kimma jelas kontroversi di WP, Abdul Rahim Sabri &amp; Rahmah Ghazali, 09 Jul 2009, Malaysiakini]&lt;/ref&gt;

==UMNO Associate Member==
The application of KIMMA to be the associate member of UMNO at last was approved by the Supreme Council of UMNO on 27 Ogos 2010. With this approval, KIMMA now enjoy the Obserser Status in all the UMNO Division and Annual General Meeting but are not allowed to be involved in the party matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/8/28/nation/6939506&amp;sec=nation Kimma now an associate member of Umno, 29 August 2010, The Star] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101130156/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2010%2F8%2F28%2Fnation%2F6939506&amp;sec=nation |date=1 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''municipal corporation''' is the legal term for a [[local government|local governing body]], including (but not necessarily limited to) [[city|cities]], [[county|counties]], [[town]]s, [[township]]s, [[charter township]]s, [[village]]s, and [[borough]]s. The term can also be used to describe [[municipally owned corporation]]s.&lt;ref name=Voornetal&gt;{{cite web|last=Voorn, Bart, Marieke L. Van Genugten, and Sandra Van Thiel (2017)|title=The efficiency and effectiveness of municipally owned corporations: A systematic review|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03003930.2017.1319360|publisher=Local Government Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes&gt;{{cite web|last=Tavares, Antonio F., and Pedro J.

==Municipal corporation as local self-government==
Municipal incorporation occurs when such [[municipality|municipalities]] become self-governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a [[municipal charter]]. A '''city charter''' or '''town charter''' or '''municipal charter''') is a legal [[document]] establishing a [[municipality]] such as a [[city]] or [[town]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Canada===
In Canada charters are granted by [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial authorities]].

===India===

The [[Corporation of Chennai]] is the oldest Municipal Corporation in the world after UK.&lt;ref name="oldestcorp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/02/stories/2003040200100300.htm|title=The first corporation |date=2003-04-02|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=14 April 2012|location=Chennai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The title "corporation" was used in [[borough]]s from soon after the [[Norman conquest of Ireland|Norman conquest]] until the [[Local Government Act 2001]]. Under the 2001 act, [[county borough]]s were renamed "cities" and their corporations became "city councils"; other borough corporations were renamed "borough councils".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/|title=Local Government Act, 2001|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=13 May 2014|page=§11(3), §11(4), Schedule 2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204040438/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/|archivedate=4 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Partition of Ireland]], the corporations in the [[Irish Free State]] were Dublin, [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]] (county boroughs) and [[Drogheda]], [[Kilkenny]], [[Sligo]], [[Clonmel]], and Wexford (non-county boroughs). [[Dún Laoghaire]] gained borough status in 1930 as “The Corporation of Dun Laoghaire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1930/en/act/pub/0027/sec0003.html#sec3|title=Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, Section 3|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galway]]'s borough status, lost in 1840, was restored in 1937; it was formally styled "the Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the Borough of Galway”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1937/en/act/prv/0003/sec0003.html |title=Local Government (Galway) Act, 1937, Section 3 |work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but referred to as "the Corporation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1937/en/act/prv/0003/sec0002.html |title=Local Government (Galway) Act, 1937, Section 2  |work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Local government in the United States}}
In the United States, such municipal corporations are established by charters that are granted either directly by a [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] by means of [[local legislation]], or indirectly under a general municipal corporation [[law]], usually after the proposed [[charter]] has passed a referendum vote of the affected population.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Municipal corporation as enterprises==
Under the enterprise meaning of the term, municipal corporations are "organisations with independent corporate status, managed by an executive board appointed primarily by local government officials, and with majority public ownership".&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt; Some MOCs rely on revenue from user fees, distinguishing them from agencies and special districts funded through taxation,&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt; although this is not always the case.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt; Municipal corporation follows a process of externalization that requires new skills and orientations from the respective local governments, and follow common changes in the institutional landscape of public services.&lt;ref name=GrossiReichard /&gt; They are argued to be more efficient than bureaucracy but have higher failure rates because of their legal and managerial autonomy.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt;

The '''National Citizens Alliance''' ({{lang-fr|Alliance National des Citoyens}}, formerly the '''National Advancement Party of Canada''') is an unregistered minor federal political party in [[Canada]]. The party was formed in 2014 and registered with [[Elections Canada]] in 2015 under the name '''Democratic Advancement Party of Canada'''. It later became the National Advancement Party. The National Advancement Party voluntarily deregistered with Elections Canada on December 31, 2017, &lt;ref name="voluntary dereg" /&gt; and created a new party called the National Citizens Alliance, which applied for registration with Elections Canada in May 2018.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The party is headquartered in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] and led by writer Stephen Garvey. 

==History==

In August 2015, the National Advancement Party of Canada was registered under the party name, Democratic Advancement Party of Canada (DAPC).&lt;ref&gt;https://lop.parl.ca/ParlInfo/Files/Party.aspx?Item=fb6c97a3-277c-43f5-8133-3c32a8908b11&amp;Language=E&lt;/ref&gt; The DAPC ran four candidates in the 2015 federal election.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-registered-parties-elections-canada-1.3277145&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the party name was changed to National Advancement Party of Canada (NAPC).

On December 13, 2017 the National Advancement Party voluntarily deregistered itself from Elections Canada effective December 31, 2017.&lt;ref name="voluntary dereg"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Elections Canada|title=Deregistration of the National Advancement Party of Canada|url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/deregistration-of-the-national-advancement-party-of-canada-663922163.html|website=CNW|publisher=Cision|accessdate=February 17, 2018|language=en|date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==2015 federal election==

The NAPC, under the DAPC name, fielded four candidates. Garvey was a candidate in [[Calgary Skyview]], Fahed Khalid was a candidate in [[Bow River (electoral district)|Bow River]], Max Veress was a candidate in [[Calgary Forest Lawn]], and Faizan Butt was a candidate in [[Calgary Nose Hill]]. No candidate was elected.

===Calgary by-elections===
The NAPC fielded two candidates in by-elections for the Calgary ridings in April 2017: Garvey was the candidate in [[Calgary Heritage]] (79 votes, 0.3% of the total), and Kulbir Singh Chawla was the candidate in [[Calgary Midnapore]] (81 votes, 0.3% of the total).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calgary By-elections|url=http://www.nationaladvancementparty.ca/calgary-by-elections/|website=National Advancement Party of Canada|accessdate=March 20, 2017|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy and views==

As of 2018, the NCA advocates these policies:
* Small, lean government 
* Lower taxes including rescinding carbon taxation and implementing a 7% reduction in federal taxation
* Legislation for the recall of any MP and referendums including the ability of the Canadian people to hold a binding national no-confidence vote on a sitting government
* Immigration policy reform
* Restoring the 1934 Bank of Canada Act and implementing balanced budgets to address the growing federal debt annual debt service payments to commercial banks

The party wants to limit [[Immigration to Canada|the immigration rate]], which they believe to be too high for proper screening and vetting, as well as restricting or halting immigration from nations with strong terrorist activities, or do not share what they describe as [[Human rights in Canada|Canadaian values]]. They also advocate deportation of all illegal immigrants who entered Canada through the [[United States]] as part of a [[Canada–United States Safe Third Country Agreement|Safe Third Country Agreement]] loophole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalcitizensalliance.ca/NCA-immigration-refugees-citizenship-policy-statement/|title=NCA Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Policy Statement - National Citizens Alliance|work=National Citizens Alliance|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCA supports [[abortion]] rights, but banning them after 3 months of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalcitizensalliance.ca/NCA-abortion-policy-statement/|title=NCA Abortion Policy Statement - National Citizens Alliance|work=National Citizens Alliance|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party states it supports [[LGBT]] rights but also states it will prohibit "schools and any other relevant organizations/institutions from exposing children to indoctrination [on] sexual identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalcitizensalliance.ca/NCA-lgbt-policy-statement/|title=NCA LGBTQ Policy Statement - National Citizens Alliance|work=National Citizens Alliance|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party supports gun rights, and describes the current gun regulations as excessive and ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalcitizensalliance.ca/NCA-firearms-policy-statement/|title=NCA Firearms Policy Statement - National Citizens Alliance|work=National Citizens Alliance|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They want to increase penalties for [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]], and a full ban on bestiality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalcitizensalliance.ca/NCA-animal-welfare-policy-statement/|title=NCA Animal Welfare Policy Statement - National Citizens Alliance|work=National Citizens Alliance|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is currently only partly banned in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/supreme-court-clarifies-canadas-bestiality-law-with-ruling/article30371581/|title=Supreme Court clarifies Canada’s bestiality law with ruling|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Citizens Alliance supports [[Quebec]] preserving their culture, but opposes full independence, instead advocating for greater cooperation between the federal government and Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalcitizensalliance.ca/NCA-canadian-unity-quebec/|title=NCA Canadian Unity and Quebec Policy Statement - National Citizens Alliance|work=National Citizens Alliance|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roles in anti-M-103 protests ==
Stephen Garvey is a former associate of the anti-immigrant group Worldwide Coalition Against Islam (WCAI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snowdon|first1=Wallis|last2=Huncar|first2=Andrea|title=Anti-immigrant protest at Alberta school follows student fight|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/red-deer-high-school-protest-anti-syrian-refugee-school-fight-controversy-1.4127344|accessdate=September 20, 2017|work=CBC News|date=May 23, 2017|language=en|quote=Stephen Garvey, a member of the anti-immigration group Worldwide Coalition Against Islam, said the intent of the protest was to raise awareness about the need to protect 'Canadian culture' in schools.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calgary festival"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kury de Castillo|first1=Carolyn|title=Calgary rally draws dozens opposed to proposed anti-Islam event|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3553888/calgary-rally-draws-dozens-opposed-to-proposed-anti-islam-event/|accessdate=September 20, 2017|work=Global News|date=June 24, 2017|language=en|quote=Garvey suggests his event was punished because of his previous association with the World Wide{{sic}} Coalition Against Islam through their shared opposition to Sharia Law.}}&lt;/ref&gt; until publicly cutting ties with the group in June 2017.&lt;ref name="Calgary Antifa" /&gt; He has led or acted as spokesperson for multiple protests against M-103 as NAPC leader.  

Garvey was the lead organizer of a March 2017 protest in Calgary against [[Motion 103]] (M-103), a non-binding resolution in the federal [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] which condemned [[Islamophobia]] and all other forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination.&lt;ref name="Metro Calgary protest alt-right"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/calgary/2017/03/19/alt-right-groups-hold-m-103-protest-calgary-city-hall.html|title=Alt-right groups hold M-103 protest outside Calgary City Hall|work=Metro Calgary|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montpetit|first1=Jonathan|title=What we learned about the far right over the weekend|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/far-right-m-103-protest-what-we-learned-1.4010710|date=March 5, 2017|work=CBC News|accessdate=March 20, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=Anna|title=Protesters in Calgary clash over M-103 anti-Islamophobia motion|url=http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/protesters-in-calgary-clash-over-m-103-anti-islamophobia-motion|accessdate=March 20, 2017|work=Calgary Herald|date=March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In May 2017, Garvey was the spokesperson for a protest in [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] which alleged that Syrian students at [[Lindsay Thurber Comprehensive High School]] were given more lenient punishments for participating in a fight than other students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rdnewsnow.com/article/538848/protesters-left-unsatisfied-following-meeting-thurber-school-officials|title=Protesters left unsatisfied following meeting with Thurber school officials|date=2017-05-23|work=rdnewsNOW|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations were false, as school officials and local [[RCMP]] confirmed all eight students involved were suspended for one week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=James|title='We are Albertans': Notley weighs in on Red Deer school protest by anti-immigration groups|url=http://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/we-are-albertans-notley-weighs-in-on-red-deer-school-protest-by-anti-immigration-groups|accessdate=September 20, 2017|work=Calgary Herald|date=May 24, 2017|quote=School officials and the RCMP said four Canadian students and four Syrian students who had been involved in a fight had all been suspended for a week from school.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the NAPC held an impromptu press conference in protest against the City of Calgary for revoking the special event permit for the party's "Say No to Hate and Racism Festival", which the City viewed as "anti-Muslim and Islamophobic" and other observers characterized as "anti-Islam".&lt;ref name="Calgary festival" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=National Advancement Party of Canada|title=Message of Unity to ALL Canadians|date=2017-06-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWf0Q4eVz1Y|accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garvey, former candidate Kulbir Singh Chawla and several other National Advancement supporters were interrupted later that month at another press conference by marchers from the [[Post-WWII anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] group Calgary Antifa.&lt;ref name="Calgary Antifa"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/calgary-anti-racism-activists-rally-cross-paths-with-opponents|title=Calgary anti-racism activists rally, cross paths with opponents|date=2017-06-25|work=Calgary Herald|access-date=2017-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''National Zeitung - Deutsche Wochen Zeitung''''' (NZ, ''National Newspaper - German Weekly Newspaper'') is a weekly, [[Far-right politics|extreme right]]&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Braun, Alexander Geisler, Martin Gerster (2009): Strategien der extremen Rechten: Hintergründe-Analysen-Antworten.

Beck.&lt;/ref&gt; newspaper, published by [[Gerhard Frey (politician)|Gerhard Frey]], who also founded the far right [[Deutsche Volksunion]] (German People's Union) as an association in 1971, turning it into a political party in 1987.

The newspaper was first published in 1951 as the ''Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung'', came under Frey's control in 1959, was renamed ''Deutsche National-Zeitung und Soldaten-Zeitung'' in 1960–61 and ''Deutsche National-Zeitung'' in 1963. In 1999 the newspaper was merged with another of Frey's publications, the ''Deutscher Anzeiger'', and became the ''National Zeitung''.

The [[Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] classifies the ''National Zeitung'' as propagating a xenophobic, nationalist and revisionist world view.

==Overview==
According to the [[Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution]], the DSZ Druckschriften- und Zeitungs-Verlag GmbH, publisher of the ''National Zeitung'', was, for a long time, the most important publisher of far right propaganda in Germany. The Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the ''National Zeitung'' as propagating a xenophobic, nationalist and revisionist world view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rechtsextremismus: Verlage und Versandhandel|trans-title=The Far Right: Publishers and mail order businesses|url=http://www.verfassungsschutz.bayern.de/rechtsextremismus/definition/erscheinungsformen/verlage/index.html|language=German |work=[[Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution]]|location= |access-date=17 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The newspaper is critical of foreigners in Germany, of German rapprochement with Poland and of Israel, accusing the German government of subservience to the latter. It frequently uses inflammatory language and tries to deflect from the German crimes during World War II by instead reporting on real or alleged German victims of the war.&lt;ref name="Bdp" /&gt;

Despite the stereotypical far-right content, the newspaper frequently reiterates its commitment to the [[German constitution]].&lt;ref name="Bdp" /&gt; The newspaper also contains a large amount of advertising for Frey's former businesses, like ''Deutsche Reisen'', a travel service, and the ''Deutsche Buchdienst'', which sells books, medals and flags.{{sfn|Mudde|2002|p=66}}

During his lifetime, a former employee described Frey as unbelievably greedy and accused him of using his publications for personal enrichment by constantly asking subscribers for donations to various causes, selling commemorative coins of "outstanding Germans" like [[Rudolf Hess]] or [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]]  with a huge mark-up, or asking them to join one of the connected associations, like the ''Aktion Oder-Neiße'', the ''Ehrenbund Rudel'' (Honor Federation Rudel) or ''Initiative für Ausländerbegrenzung'' (Initiative for the limitation of foreigners).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=29 May 1989|title=„Seine Raffgier ist umfassend“|trans-title=His greed is all encompassing|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13496051.html|language=German |work=[[Der Spiegel]]|location= |access-date=18 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
An earlier, unrelated, ''National Zeitung'' had existed in Germany from 1848 onward, as a liberal newspaper, published in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel" &gt;{{cite news |date=13 March 1963|title=Deutsche National Zeitung|trans-title=|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45142623.html|language=German |work=[[Der Spiegel]]|location= |access-date=17 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Deutsche National-Zeitung'' was also published in German language in the United States from 1838 to 1840, in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deutsche National-Zeitung|trans-title=|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/sn86072099/|language=|work=[[Library of Congress]]|location= |access-date=18 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''National Zeitung'' was first published as the ''Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung'' (English: German Soldiers Newspaper) in 1951. The idea for a newspaper as an advocate for the rights of German soldiers originated in a prisoner of war camp in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] and came from Nazi ''[[Kreisleiter]]'' Helmut Damerau and the [[Wehrmacht]] Colonel Heinrich Detloff von Kalben. It was supported by [[Waffen-SS]] General [[Paul Steiner]] and financed by Leo Giess, a carpenter, as well as [[German Americans]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeit" &gt;{{cite news |first=Dietrich |last=Strothmann |date=8 September 1967|title=Angeklagt: die National-Zeitung|trans-title=Charged: The National Zeitung|url=https://www.zeit.de/1967/36/angeklagt-die-national-zeitung/komplettansicht|language=German |work=[[Die Zeit]]|location= |access-date=17 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung'' was an advocate of [[German rearmament]] but found itself in financial trouble by 1953, when financial support from the US dried up. Damerau approached the West German government for financial support and the newspaper received a monthly subsidy of DM 11,000 from 1953 onward.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt; This however was not received well by the paper's readership, and the circulation of the ''Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung'' dropped from 30,000 to 12,000. In 1954 the German government pushed for the sale of the paper, which Damerau refused and, consequently, the government dropped its financial support. The paper was subsequently only published fortnightly and, for a time in 1955, only monthly and shifted further to the right of the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The fifth anniversary of the first publication of the paper saw it print well-wishes from a number of high ranking former Wehrmacht Generals, among them the former ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]s'' [[Erich von Manstein]], [[Wilhelm List]] and [[Albert Kesselring]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

It called for and organised protests, like when German [[Handball]] club [[THW Kiel]] hosted a team from [[Wrocław]], Poland, because, in the paper's opinion Wrocław should be refereed to by its former German name, Breslau. It protested against any form of recognition of the post-war Polish-German border, the [[Oder–Neisse line]] and attacked prominent German scientists like [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] for publishing the [[Memorandum of Tübingen]] (German:''Tübinger Memorandum'') in support of the border. The newspaper also supported the wife of [[Rudolf Hess]] in her attempts to free her husband.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The newspaper advocated a return to German military traditions after the formation of the [[Bundeswehr]] and attempted to influence officers who had previously served in the Wehrmacht. It was critical of [[Wolf Graf von Baudissin]]'s concept of citizens in uniform, and the West German government became, in turn, critical of the newspaper. German defence minister [[Franz-Josef Strauß]] made unsuccessful attempts to purchase the newspaper, offering Damerau DM 150,000 for the financially troubled paper. Damerau instead asked right-wing journalist [[Gerhard Frey]] for a loan and the latter, independently wealthy, gradually gained a controlling interest in the ''Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung''.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The newspaper continued to publish content with a [[historical revisionist]] view, attempting to deflect Germany's responsibility for [[World War II]] and attacking members of the German resistance as traitors to the Fatherland.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Since 1959 under Frey's control, the ''Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung'' was renamed ''Deutsche National-Zeitung und Soldaten-Zeitung'' in 1960–61. It raised its circulation from 27,500 in 1958 to 70,000 by 1963&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt; and 131,000 by 1967.&lt;ref name="Zeit" /&gt; Frey, while not [[Holocaust denial|outrightly denying]] the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Laws against Holocaust denial|illegal in Germany]], stated that the he considered the number of victims as to high, and argued in the 1960s that Germany should pay less compensation because of this.&lt;ref name="Zeit" /&gt; Frey and his newspaper frequently published anti-Israel and pro-Arab content.&lt;ref name="Zeit" /&gt;

In 1963, the newspaper was renamed ''Deutsche National-Zeitung''. In 1987, Gerhard Frey founded the German far right party [[Deutsche Volksunion]].&lt;ref name="Freydead" &gt;{{cite news |date=23 February 2013|title=DVU-Gründer Frey gestorben|trans-title=DVU founder Frey passed away|url=https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2013-02/dvu-frey|language=German |work=[[Die Zeit]]|location= |access-date=17 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Frey's aim had been to make the ''National Zeitung'' the central national organ of all far right parties in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 February 2013|title=DVU-Gründer Gerhard Frey gestorben|trans-title=DVU founder Gerhard Frey passed away|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/politiker-verleger-mulimillionaer-dvu-gruender-gerhard-frey-gestorben-1.1607848|language=German |work=[[Sueddeutsche Zeitung]]|location= |access-date=17 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1971 Frey published a second paper, the ''Deutscher Anzeiger''. In 1986, he purchased the revisionist ''Deutsche Wochen-Zeitung'', which had originally been published by members of the far-right [[National Democratic Party of Germany]]. In 1991, Frey merged the two newspapers into one, becoming the ''Deutsche Wochen-Zeitung – Deutscher Anzeiger''. Content of this paper was almost identical to the ''Deutsche National-Zeitung'' and, in 1999, the two were merged into one, becoming the ''National Zeitung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Grumke, Bernd Wagner |title=Handbuch Rechtsradikalismus|trans-title=Pocketbook of the far-right|url=http://www.belltower.news/artikel/druckschriften-und-zeitungsverlags-gmbh-dsz-verlag|year=2002|publisher=Leske + Budrich|isbn=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mudde|2002|p=60}}

Despite all this and the fact that Germany grew in size and population after the German reunion, the circulation of the newspaper had dropped to 38,000 by 2007.&lt;ref name="Bdp" &gt;{{cite web |title=Rechtsextreme Schwarz-Weiß-Malerei - Ein kurzer Überblick über die tonangebenden rechtsextremen Printmedien|trans-title=Far-right black &amp; white vision: A short overview of the major far-right print medias|url=http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/rechtsextremismus/41714/rechtsextreme-schwarz-weiss-malerei?p=all|language=German |work=[[Federal Agency for Civic Education]]|location= |access-date=17 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The newspaper was featured in the West German movie [[Roses for the Prosecutor]], in which one of the main characters, the state prosecutor Dr. Schramm, a man with a secret Nazi past, purchases the ''Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung''. The newspaper subsequently used this exposure for advertisement.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

==Goals==
Since 1987,&lt;ref name="Zirpoli1994"/&gt; Partners programs have been implemented nationally and internationally. Thousands of Partners graduates are part of a growing national and international network of community leaders serving on policy making committees, commissions, boards, and in elected office at all levels of government.&lt;ref name="Zirpoli1994"&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate=2008-09-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the combination of both on-site training and a vast array of [[internet]]-based training resources, Partners in Policymaking is intended to assist people with disabilities to know their [[civil rights|rights]], to know what to expect in terms of high quality services and supports, and to know how to obtain such services and supports within their local communities.

==History==
The program was originally conceived by the [[Minnesota]] Governor's Council on Developmental Disabilities under funding by the U.S. [[Administration on Developmental Disabilities]]&lt;ref name="Zirpoli1994"/&gt; and has since been adopted in over 35 US states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Pattern-of-life analysis''' is a method of [[surveillance]] specifically used for documenting or understanding a subject's (or many subjects') habits. This information can then potentially be used to predict future actions by the subject(s) being observed. This form of observation can, and is, generally done without the consent of the subject, with motives including but not limited to [[Signals intelligence|security]], [[normal profit|profit]], scientific research, regular censuses, and [[traffic analysis]]. Unlike these specific areas of surveillance, pattern-of-life analysis is not limited to one medium and can encompass anything in an individual's (or system of individuals') life from their internet browsing habits, to a record of instances of choices made in order to determine a statistical 'favorite'.

== Notable examples ==

=== Wide-Area Motion Imagery ===

[[Wide-Area Motion Imagery (WAMI)|Wide-area motion imagery (WAMI)]] generates high-resolution images to enable tracking and recording of vehicle and pedestrian movements over city-sized areas. Pattern of life (POL) or behavior pattern describes a recurrent (e.g., normalcy) way of acting by an individual or group toward a given object or in a given situation. Usually, one has a specific POL, and this POL is repeatable. Using full motion video or WAMI data with extracted tracks can be used for POL analysis.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pattern of Life from WAMI Objects Tracking based on Context-Aware Tracking and Information Network Models|url=http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1691331|accessdate=23 May 2013|last1= Gao|first1= J.|last2= Ling|first2= Haibin|last3= Blasch|first3= Erik|last4= Pham|first4= Khanh|last5= Wang|first5= Zhonghai|last6= Chen|first6= Genshe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Context-aware tracking with wide-area motion imagery

=== Esri's use of ArcGIS ===
Esri is an international supplier of [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS) software, web GIS and [[geodatabase]] management applications. Esri uses the name [[ArcGIS]] to refer to its suite of GIS software products, which operate on desktop, server, and mobile platforms. The term GIS describes any [[information]] system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares and displays geographic information for informing [[decision making]]. With this technology, the company's goal is to unify information of a subject's life habits and their geographical whereabouts with statistics related to [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] casualties in an effort to predict and prevent another IED incident from happening. In one presentation used at an Esri Federal User Conference, it states: "Exploitation of a cell's network enables a commander with the right tools to get 'Left of Boom' [i.e. before an IED or bomb detonates]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using ArcGIS for Intelligence Analysis|url=http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/feduc11/papers/tech/feduc-using-arcgis-for-intelligence-analysis.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2014|last1= Mason|first1= Tony|last2= Foss|first2= Suzanne|last3= Lam|first3= Vinh|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MARINA ===
MARINA is an NSA database and analysis toolset for intercepted Internet metadata (DNI in NSA terminology). The database stores metadata up to a year. According to documents leaked by Edward Snowden: "The Marina metadata application tracks a user's browser experience, gathers contact information/content and develops summaries of target" and "[o]f the more distinguishing features, Marina has the ability to look back on the last 365 days' worth of DNI metadata seen by the Sigint collection system, regardless whether or not it was tasked for collection." [Emphasis in original NSA document.] The stored metadata is mainly used for pattern-of-life analysis. US persons are not exempt because metadata is not considered data by US law (section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act). {{fact|date=July 2017}}

MARINA's phone counterpart is MAINWAY.

'''Premises liability''' (known in some [[common law]] jurisdictions as '''occupiers' liability''') is the liability that a landowner or occupier has for certain [[tort]]s that occur on their [[real property|land]]. 

==Scope of the law==
[[Premises]] liability may range from things from "injuries caused by a variety of hazardous conditions, including open excavations, uneven pavement, standing water, crumbling curbs, wet floors, uncleared snow, icy walks, falling objects, inadequate security, insufficient lighting, concealed holes, improperly secured mats, or defects in chairs or benches".  As "ExpertLaw" puts it: "Premises liability law is the body of law which makes the person who is in possession of land or premises responsible for certain injuries suffered by persons who are present on the premises". &lt;ref name=expert /&gt;

For premises liability to apply:
# The defendant must possess the land or "[[premises]]".&lt;ref name=expert&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Premises Liability Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/premises_liability/premises_liability.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=24 August 2017|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The plaintiff must be an [[invitee]] or, in certain cases, a [[licensee]].&lt;ref name=expert /&gt;  Traditionally, [[trespass]]ers were not protected under premises liability law.&lt;ref name=expert /&gt;  However, in 1968, the California Supreme Court issued a vastly influential opinion, ''Rowland v. Christian'', 69 Cal.2d 108 (1968), which abolished the significance of legal distinctions such as invitee, licensee, or trespasser in determining whether one could hold the possessor of a premises liable for harm.  This opinion led to changes in the law in many other states in the United States, and is viewed as a seminal opinion in the development of the law of premises liability.   
# There must be [[negligence]]—a breach of the [[duty of care]]—or some other [[Tort|wrongful act]].  In recent years, the law of premises liability has evolved to include cases where a person is injured on the premises of another by a third person's wrongful act, such as an assault.  These cases are sometimes referred to as "third party premises liability" cases and they represent a highly complex and dynamic area of tort law.  They pose especially complex legal issues of duty and causation because the injured party is seeking to hold a possessor or owner of property directly or vicariously liable when the immediate injury-producing act was, arguably, not caused by the possessor or owner.

==Common law of premises liability==

[[File:Occupiers Liability Warning Notice Ireland.JPG|thumb|right|A notice informing potential entrants of limits to the duty of care]]
At common law, in the case of landowners, the extent of their duty of care to those who came on their premises varied depending on whether a person was classified as a [[trespasser]], [[licensee]], or [[invitee]].  This rule was eventually abolished in some common law jurisdictions.  For example, England enacted the [[Occupiers Liability Act 1957]].  Similarly, in the 1968 landmark case of ''[[Rowland v. Christian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Rowland v. Christian'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/69C2d108.htm 69 Cal. 2d 108] (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of California]] replaced the old classifications with a general duty of care to ''all'' persons on one's land, regardless of their status.  After several highly publicized and controversial cases, the [[California Legislature]] enacted a statute in 1985 that partially restored immunity to landowners from some types of lawsuits from trespassers.&lt;ref&gt;''Calvillo-Silva v. Home Grocery'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/19C4t714.htm 19 Cal. 4th 714] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorado's highest court adopted the ''Rowland'' unified duty of care analysis in 1971.  The resulting explosion of lawsuits against Colorado landowners caused the state legislature to enact the Colorado Premises Liability Act in 1986, which enacted a cleaned-up statutory version of the common law classifications ''and'' simultaneously expressly displaced all common law remedies against landowners in order to prevent state courts from again expanding their liability.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], under the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995, the duty of care to trespassers, visitors and "recreational users" can be restricted by the occupier; provided reasonable notice is given, for which a prominent notice at the usual entrance to the premises usually suffices.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0010/print.html|title=Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995|date=17 June 1995|work=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=2009-10-16}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premises liability case law of the United States==
In [[United States law]], premises liability law is highly developed and can differ from state to state.  This section includes some examples of state case law.

===Florida===

In ''Lai Chau v. Southstar Equity Limited Co. and Brookside Properties Inc.'', a former [[University of South Florida]] student, survived a violent [[Kidnapping|abduction]] in her North [[Tampa]] apartment complex in 2001.  Two men sneaked past the complex’s security gate, and shot the 20-year-old student three times in the head.  The landmark negligent security case won Chau $15.7 million in damages in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nguyen|first1=Dong-Phuong|title=Carjack victim begins 2002 at home|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/01/01/TampaBay/Carjack_victim_begins.shtml|accessdate=24 August 2017|publisher=St. Petersberg Times|date=1 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===

In  ''Peralta v. Henriquez'',&lt;ref name=Peralta&gt;{{cite web|title=Peralta v.

The '''probabilistic voting theory''', also known as the '''probabilistic voting model''', is a [[voting theory]] developed by professors [[Assar Lindbeck]] and [[Jörgen Weibull]] in the article "Balanced-budget redistribution as the outcome of political competition", published in 1987 in the journal ''Public Choice'', which has gradually replaced the [[median voter theory]], thanks to its ability to find equilibrium within multi-dimensional spaces.

The probabilistic voting model assumes that voters are imperfectly informed about candidates and their platforms. Candidates are also imperfectly informed about the utility preferences of the electorate and the distribution of voters' preferences.

Unlike the median voter theorem, what drives the equilibrium policy is both the numerosity and the density of social groups and not the median position of voters on a preference scale. This difference explains why social groups which have a great homogeneity of preferences are more politically powerful than those whose preferences are dispersed.

==Motivation and Applications== 

[[Political economy]] and [[public economics]] are the main fields where the probabilistic voting theory is applied. In particular, it was used to explain [[public expenditure]] (Persson &amp; Tabellini, 2000; Hassler, Krusell, Storesletten &amp; Zilibotti, 2005), [[public debt]] dynamics (Song, Storesletten &amp; Zilibotti, 2012), effect of mass media (Strömberg, 2004) [[social security]] systems (Profeta, 2002; Gonzalez Eiras &amp; Niepelt, 2008) and taxation (Hettich &amp; Winer, 2005; Canegrati, 2007).

Raphael Boleslavsky and Christopher Cotton (2015) show how the underlying uncertainty that candidates have about the preferences of voters may be the result of information revelation during campaigns, with more informative campaigns leading to greater ex ante uncertainty about election-day preferences. This in turn can increase policy divergence. 

Probabilistic voting models are usually preferred to traditional [[Anthony Downs|Downsian]] median voter models, as in the former all voters have an influence on the policy outcome, whereas in the latter all power rests in the hands of the pivotal voter or group. For instance, in models where young and old (or rich and poor) voters have conflicting interests, probabilistic voting models predict that the winning candidate strikes a balance between the different interests in her/his policy platform. Due to the smooth mapping between the distribution of policy preferences and the political outcomes, this model has proven to be very tractable and convenient to use in dynamic models with repeated voting.

== Origins and spread ==
[[File:Really Really Free Market DC.jpg|thumb|Items laid out on a tarp at the Really Really Free Market at [[Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.|Dupont Circle]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]  The first known Really, Really Free Market took place in at a [[Food Not Bombs]] meal in Christchurch, New Zealand as a protest to a meeting on free trade. The Really Really Free Markets started to spread around Asia. Jakarta Food Not Bombs organized a Really Really Free Market on Buy Nothing Day. The first Really Really Free Market in the United States happened simultaneously in [[Miami, Florida]], and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] during the anti-globalization protests against the [[FTAA]] in 2003. The idea of a "Really, Really Free Market" emerged from a visioning ritual by members of the Pagan Cluster in Austin in preparation of the FTAA Summit in Miami, November 2003.  Members of the Green Bloc picked up the idea and made it real. Participants from the SouthEast Anarchist Network (SeaNET)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SouthEast Anarchist Network |url=http://www.anarcha.org/seanet/main.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; held demonstrations using the Really, Really Free Market to protest the [[G8]] summit in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Simpich |url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2004/06/07/16839171.php |work=San Francisco Bay Area Indymedia |title=Really REALLY Free Market Report |date=June 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea quickly spread across the United States, Russia, and other countries such as [[Australia]], [[England]], [[Malaysia]], [[Taiwan]], [[South Africa]], and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reallyreallyfree.org/index.php?l=Worldwide_RRFMs Other RRFMs], The Really Really Free Market.

== In Russia ==
[[File:Roll-up at the Absolutely Free Fair in Ivanovo, Russia on 4 August 2012..jpg|thumb|Roll-up at the Absolutely Free Fair in Ivanovo, Russia on 4 August 2012.]]

The first Russian Really Really Free Market was organized in Moscow in 2008. The original name of RRFM was changed to "Freemarket" or "Absolutely Free Fair". Since that time the idea of RRFM has spread widely across the Russian Federation. Recently participants of the movement arrange regular meetings in [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Ivanovo]], [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Perm]], [[Belgorod]], [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Kirov]], [[Kaliningrad]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Vologda]], [[Volgograd]], [[Tolyatti]], [[Volzhsky, Samara Oblast|Volzhsky]], [[Petrozavodsk]].

Due to the often harsh Russian climate the RRFMs usually take place indoors, but summer time meetings often occur in public parks, yards of apartment houses or city squares. In Ivanovo, for instance, the very first free fair was held in Yesenin Square on 19 June 2011, but as winter set in, the RRFM meetings were moved to the reference room of the Regional Public library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ivanovo.rfn.ru/rnews.html?id=73393&amp;cid=7#], The Free Market in Ivanovo&lt;/ref&gt;

RRFMs in Russia are often accompanied by master classes in handiwork (mehendi, hair dressing, making stencils for textile printing, etc.), lectures on social and ecological problems and the collection of secondary raw materials and charity fundraising in aid animal shelters.

{{lang|ga|'''Sinn Féin'''}} ("ourselves" or "we ourselves") and {{lang|ga|'''Sinn Féin Amháin'''}} ("ourselves only / ourselves alone / solely us") are [[Irish-language]] phrases used as a [[political slogan]] by [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. While advocating Irish national self-reliance, its precise political meaning was undefined, variously interpreted as the aim of a separate [[Irish republicanism|Irish republic]] or (as advocated by [[Arthur Griffith]]) that of a [[dual monarchy]]. Its earliest use was to describe individual political radicals unconnected with any party and espousing a more "advanced nationalism" than the [[Irish Home Rule movement]]. In the 1890s "Sinn Féin, Sinn Féin amháin" was the slogan of the [[Gaelic League]],&lt;ref name="LAFFAN"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Resurrection of Ireland: The Sinn Féin Party, 1916–1923|first=Michael|last=Laffan|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1999|isbn=0-521-65073-9|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Connell2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connell Jr|first=Joseph E.A.|date=July–August 2011|title=Arthur Griffith and the development of Sinn Féin|journal=History Ireland|volume=19|issue=4|url=http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/arthur-griffith-and-the-development-of-sinn-fein-by-joseph-e-a-connell-jr/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which advocated the revival of the Irish language.

:[T]here is a wonderfully strict correction of [[Louis MacNeice]]. In 'Autumn Journal' he commits the solecism of translating the Gaelic words ''Sinn Fein'' as 'Ourselves Alone'. This is how every English schoolboy has been taught to render these words since before the [[Black and Tans]]. No, say the editors – Messrs [[Seamus Heaney|Heaney]] and [[Brian Friel|Friel]] and [[Seamus Deane|Deane]] and [[Tom Paulin|Paulin]] and [[Andrew Carpenter (academic)|Carpenter]] and [[Jonathan Williams (literary agent)|William[s]]] and the rest. This is too common a mistake. The words mean 'We Ourselves'. I cannot think how such an important literal translation, with all its ironic implications, took so long to be made. Still, what correction could be made with more grace? Who will not be sad to think of what was perhaps lost in translation?

''[[Ourselves Alone (film)|Ourselves Alone]]'' was a 1936 British film, set during the [[Anglo-Irish War]] of 1919–21.

==Early uses==
A collection was published in 1845 of poems printed in ''[[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|The Nation]]'', the nationalist newspaper of the [[Young Irelanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1845&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a poem entitled ''Ourselves Alone'' by "[[Slieve Gullion|Sliabh Cuilinn]]" ([[John O'Hagan]]):&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1845, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;
:[...]Too long our Irish hearts we schooled
:In patient hopes to bide,
:By dreams of English justice fooled
:And English tongues that lied.
:That hour of weak delusion's past—
:The empty dream has flown :
:Our hope and strength, we find at last,
:Is in &lt;small&gt;OURSELVES ALONE&lt;/small&gt;.[...]

Another poem in the same volume, ''The Spirit of the Nation'' by D.F. McCarthy, uses the expression "Sinn Féin". The [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]] in the original for this is 'Ourselves—or "&lt;small&gt;OURSELVES ALONE&lt;/small&gt;."'&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1845, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;
:[...]''A chuisle mo chroidhe'', we are wounded and sore,
:So bad that we cannot endure it much more.
:A cure we must have, though the Saxons may stare
:And "curse like a trooper;" but devil may care,
:''Sinn Féin'' is our watch-word—so devil may care.[...]

The glossary at the end of the volume renders ''sinn féin'' as "we ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1845, p.326&lt;/ref&gt;

A nationalist play by "Tom Telephone" (Thomas Stanislaus Cleary) published in 1882 was entitled ''Shin Fain; or Ourselves Alone''.&lt;ref name="LAFFAN"/&gt;

In [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', set in 1904, [[The Citizen (character)|The Citizen]], a boorish nationalist partly modelled on [[Michael Cusack]], shouts "Sinn Féin! Sinn Féin amháin!" during an altercation with [[Leopold Bloom]]; these were also the titles of two nationalist ballads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gula|first=Marianna|date=Autumn–Winter 2006|title='As Good as Any Bloody Play in the Queen's Royal Theatre': Performing the Nation in the 'Cyclops' episode of "Ulysses"|journal=Irish University Review|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|volume=36|issue=2|pages=257–279|jstor=25517312|subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4300/4300-h/4300-h.htm|title=''Ulysses'' by James Joyce|year=2008|work=[[Project Gutenberg]]|accessdate=30 September 2015|quote=''Sinn Fein!'' says the citizen.

==After 1905==
{{main article|History of Sinn Féin}}
The name was adopted by [[Arthur Griffith]] for the "Sinn Féin policy" he presented in 1905, and the [[Sinn Féin|Sinn Féin party]] formed over 1905–07.&lt;ref name="Connell2011"/&gt; In the 1910s, "Sinn Feiners" was a common, often derogatory, label for militant nationalists, regardless of any connection to Griffith's movement.&lt;ref name="Townshend81"&gt;Townshend 2006, pp. 70,80–81&lt;/ref&gt; A 1915 mock-unionist article in a [[University College Dublin]] student journal distinguished types of Irish nationalist:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 1915|title=Rule Britannia!|journal=The National Student|volume=VI|issue=1}} reprinted in {{cite book|last=Martin|first=F.

:The principal factions are the Separatists, who want to set up a Republic by force of arms; the Sinn Féiners, who want to get the [[Act of Union 1801|Union]] repealed by means of [[passive resistance]]; and the Constitutionalists, who want to win Home Rule by speechifying. There are also some people who want to set up Home Rule by force of arms, but they are not worth considering, for they haven't any arms.

When the [[Irish Volunteers]] split in September 1914, the more militant group was soon dubbed the "Sinn Féin Volunteers" by the security forces of the [[Dublin Castle administration]].&lt;ref name="Townshend81"/&gt; Likewise, the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] was quickly dubbed the "Sinn Féin rebellion" by British-oriented newspapers.&lt;ref name="Connell2011"/&gt; However, the Sinn Féin party had no role in the Volunteers or the Rising, although many members had participated.&lt;ref name="Connell2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Townshend81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Townshend314"&gt;Townshend 2006, pp.314–5&lt;/ref&gt; All members of the party's National Council were [[internment|interned]] after the Rising.&lt;ref name="Townshend314"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Townshend 2006, pp.131–2&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between the specific party and the broader slogan of radical nationalism was finally blurred in 1917, when Griffith yielded leadership of the party to [[Éamon de Valera]], the senior surviving leader of the Rising.&lt;ref&gt;Townshend 2006, pp.327–35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laffan|first=Michael|date=March 1971|title=The Unification of Sinn Fein in 1917|journal=Irish Historical Studies|volume=17|issue=67|pages=353–379: 353 fn.1|jstor=30005764|subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Warren Fisher]] was sent by the UK government in 1920 to report on the Dublin Castle administration; in his highly critical report, he stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McColgan|first=John|title=Administration and Partition 1920–22|journal=Administration|publisher=[[Institute of Public Administration (Ireland)|Institute of Public Administration]]|location=Dublin|volume=28|issue=2|pages=147–183 : 151–2 |year=1980 |url=ftp://78.153.208.68/bkp/ipa/PDF/B2_irishadministration.pdf#page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:the phrase 'Sinn Fein' is a shibboleth with which everyone not a 'loyalist' is denounced, and from listening to the people with influence you would certainly gather that Sinn Fein and outrage were synonymous.

{{Politics of Slovakia}}

A '''referendum on banning [[same-sex marriage]]''' was held in [[Slovakia]] on 7 February 2015.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|title=Slovakia to Hold Referendum on Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/slovakia-hold-referendum-sex-marriage-27218382|work=ABC News|date=Nov 27, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209034357/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/slovakia-hold-referendum-sex-marriage-27218382|archivedate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/e8c1072da28e44c5b28b7e695ef5d465/slovakia-hold-referendum-same-sex-marriage|title=Slovakia to hold referendum on same-sex marriage|date=27 Nov 2014|work=AP Bigstory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claimed the referendum was pushed by religious and conservative organisations,&lt;ref name="smesocialists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20053418/sd-group-of-eu-parliament-slams-slovak-referendum.html|title=Socialists and Democrats of EU parliament slam Slovak referendum|work=Slovak Spectator|date=6 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to block gay couples from gaining more rights.&lt;ref name="Jan Lopatka"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/05/us-slovakia-referendum-idUSKBN0L91OQ20150205|title=Slovak conservatives seek to bar gay marriage in referendum|author=Jan Lopatka|date=5 Feb 2015|work=Reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was not valid as the turnout did not reach the required threshold of 50%, with only 21.4% of citizens casting a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/slovakia-referendum-on-gay-adoption-ban-fails-1423355269|title=Slovakia Referendum on Gay-Adoption Ban Fails|work=Wall Street Journal|author=Leos Rousek|date=7 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In June 2014, the Slovakia National Council amended the country's constitution to specifically deny same sex couples the legal protections associated with marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/06/slovakia-amends-constitution-to-define-marriage-as-between-one-man-and-one-woman.php|title=Slovakia amends constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman|work=Jurist Paper Chase|author=Julie Diesher|date=5 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedaily.sk/amnesty-international-condemns-anti-gay-constitutional-change/|title=Amnesty International Condemns Anti-Gay Constitutional Change|work=thedaily.sk|author=John Boyd|date=6 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was initiated after the conservative church backed group Alliance for Family gathered 400,000 signatures calling for a vote on the law.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=dw2015/&gt; The [[Conference of Slovak Bishops]], which organises anti-abortion and anti-euthanasia rallies overwhelmingly supported the move.&lt;ref name=dw2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/53304/2/group_seeks_gay_marriage_referendum.html|title=Group seeks gay marriage referendum|date=17 Mar 2014|work=Slovak Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questions==
Voters were asked questions on three issues:&lt;ref name=Spectator&gt;[http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/56072/10/president_announces_the_referendum_on_protection_of_the_family.html President announces the referendum on "protection of the family"] The Slovak Spectator, 3 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth question on registered partners was rejected by the [[Constitutional Court of Slovakia|Constitutional Court]].&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

In order for the proposal to be approved, [[voter turnout]] needed to be at least 50%.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

==Campaign==
Supporters of the referendum campaigned predominantly in churches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://visegradinsight.eu/slovakias-anti-gay-referendum30012015/|title=Slovakia’s anti-gay referendum|author=Frank Markovic|date=30 Jan 2015|work=Visegrad Insight|publisher=[[Visegrád Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Conference of Slovak Bishops raising funds for the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope Endorses Referendum Denying Marriage And Adoption Rights To Same-Sex Couples|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/pope-endorses-referendum-denying-marriage-and-adoption-right|author=J Lester Feder|work=Buzzfeed}}&lt;br/&gt;As quoted by {{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2015/02/05/pope-has-kind-words-backers-anti-equality-measures-slovakia|title=Pope Has Kind Words for Backers of Anti-Equality Measures in Slovakia|author=Trudy Ring|date=5 Feb 2015|work=The Advocate}}&lt;/ref&gt; 62% of Slovaks identify as Catholics, and although less than 40 percent of those attend mass regularly, Reuters describes Slovakia as "one of the most religious countries in Europe on the surface".&lt;ref name="Jan Lopatka"/&gt;

The vote, which cost more than €6.3 million to run, led to conservative groups spending around €110,000 on advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turnout key to referendum result|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20053236/turnout-key-to-referendum-result.html|work=Slovak Spectator|author=Radka Minarechová|date=26 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian conservative activism platform [[CitizenGo]], run by [[Brian S.

Slovakia's LGBT groups, which are smaller and less organised than their opponents, encouraged people not to vote at all, for fear that "no" voters might push turnout over 50%.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedaily.sk/anti-gay-referendum-stirring-sentiment/|title=Anti-Gay Referendum Stirring Sentiment|author=John Boyd|date=19 Jan 2015|work=TheDaily.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2015/02/06/activists-trust-to-apathy-as-slovakia-faces-vote-to-ban-gay-marriage/|title=Activists trust to apathy as Slovakia faces vote to ban gay marriage|date=6 Feb 2015|author=Henry Foy|work=Ft.com blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Former Slovak Prime Minister [[Iveta Radičová]] said that if the referendum passes, "It will not improve the standing of families and marriages; and there won’t be any more children, either."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visegradrevue.eu/iveta-radicova-i-worry-that-all-we-will-be-left-with-is-filth/|title=Iveta Radičová: I worry that all we will be left with is filth|author=Monika Tódová|date=6 Feb 2015|work=Visegrad Revue}}&lt;/ref&gt; She criticised the referendum as being pushed by people "want to cover up the real problems" in Slovakia, like "balancing of work responsibilities with childcare, unemployment," financial insecurity and domestic violence. Radičová described the movement as motivated by "the fear of the new, the unknown, and the other" and condemned opposition to [[sex education]], pointing out that it is proven to reduce sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, and delay sexual experimentation.

The libertarian party [[Freedom and Solidarity]] criticised the referendum,&lt;ref name=dw2015/&gt; as did the EU parliament's [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists and Democrats]].&lt;ref name="smesocialists"/&gt;

[[Boris Dittrich]] criticised the involvement of American Evangelical donors like Alliance Defending Freedom in determining the social agenda in Eastern European democracies, when they had lost on same-sex marriage in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/02/06/dispatches-unholy-alliance-slovakia-s-referendum-risks-rights|title=Dispatches: Unholy Alliance for Slovakia’s Referendum Risks Rights|date=6 Feb 2015|author=Boris Dittrich|work=Human Rights Watch Dispatches}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] has condemned the country's discrimination against LGBT people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/slovakia-referendum-marriage-panders-homophobic-discrimination-2015-02-02|title=Slovakia: Referendum on marriage panders to homophobic discrimination|date=2 Feb 2015|work=Amnesty International News|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/fr/documents/eur72/001/2014/fr/|title=Slovakia: Amnesty International condemns discriminatory constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union between a man and a woman|date=5 June 2015|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205404021_text|title=Slovak Republic: Marriage Defined as Between One Man and One Woman|author=Wendy Zeldin|date=10 Jun 2014|work=Law.gov|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the international media, including [[The Economist]], critiqued the political process in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedaily.sk/no-freedom-till-were-equal-slovakias-referendum/|title=No Freedom Till We’re Equal, Slovakia’s Referendum|work=TheDaily.sk|date=23 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay rights groups criticised the referendum, saying "unemployment, social problems and alcoholism" would not be solved by a vote to ban gay marriages or adoptions.&lt;ref name=dw2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/slovakia-holds-referendum-on-gay-marriage/a-18241863|title=Slovakia holds referendum on gay marriage|work=Deutsche Welle|date=6 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; International critics criticised the ruling [[Direction – Social Democracy|social democratic]] party for pandering to populist religious homophobia, and critiqued the ballot as a waste of millions of euros,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20052482/bigoted-balloting.html|title=Bigoted balloting|work=Slovak Spectator|date=3 Nov 2014|author=Beata Balogová}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a distraction from Slovakia's economic woes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentsforliberty.org/blog/2014/07/09/the-dirty-politics-behind-slovakias-ban-on-same-sex-marriage/|title=The Dirty Politics behind Slovakia’s Ban on Same-Sex Marriage|author=Dave Stancel|work=Students For Liberty|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150127212319/http://studentsforliberty.org/blog/2014/07/09/the-dirty-politics-behind-slovakias-ban-on-same-sex-marriage/|archivedate=2015-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "genuine problems of Slovak public policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visegradrevue.eu/slovakias-curious-cultural-war/|title=Slovakia’s curious cultural war|author=Dalibor Roháč|date=25 Dec 2014|work=Visegrad Revue}}&lt;br/&gt;As quoted in {{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/blog/unlikely-fight-over-gay-rights-heart-europe|title=The Unlikely Fight over Gay Rights in the Heart of Europe|author=DALIBOR ROHAC|date=5 Feb 2015|work=Cato Institute blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Francis]] supported the referendum, blessing the opponents of gay rights, stating “I greet the pilgrims from Slovakia and, through them, I wish to express my appreciation to the entire Slovak church, encouraging everyone to continue their efforts in defense of the family, the vital cell of society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2015/02/05/pope-has-kind-words-backers-anti-equality-measures-slovakia|title=Pope Has Kind Words for Backers of Anti-Equality Measures in Slovakia|author=Trudy Ring|date=5 Feb 2015|work=The Advocate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apbigstoryfeb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/83acba5f3cd846ceaa0e335f75595d7f/value-clash-west-slovakia-votes-gay-rights-curb|title=In value clash with West, Slovakia votes on gay rights curb|work=AP Bigstory|author=KAREL JANICEK|publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope Endorses Referendum Denying Marriage And Adoption Rights To Same-Sex Couples|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/pope-endorses-referendum-denying-marriage-and-adoption-right|author=J Lester Feder|work=Buzzfeed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of theologians issued a position paper claiming that the referendum is touching on ethical questions and those should be solved by discussion rather than by voting. The authors of the position Ondrej Prostredník, František Ábel and Igor Kišš, all from the Lutheran Theological Faculty of Comenius University in Bratislava also claimed that several times in history the way of shortcuts and authoritarian decisions in favor of Christian values proved to be bad and damaged the very cause of Christ’s Gospel. They also criticized the referendum as an immoral attempt to shift the responsibility for the crisis of family values in the Slovak society to homosexuals. The position paper as joined by 48 theologians and intellectuals from different churches and sectors of the society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jetotak.sk/editorial/stanovisko-teologov-k-referendu-7-2-2015 Stanovisko teológov k referendu 7. 2. 2015] Jetotak, 2 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Another EU nation, Croatia, banned same-sex marriages in a [[Croatian constitutional referendum, 2013|constitutional referendum on 1 December 2013]]. Turnout in Croatia was also less than 50%, but its constitution does not invalidate a referendum based on turnout.

A [[Eurobarometer]] poll on in 2006 found that 19% of Slovaks supported same sex marriage and 81% opposed, while 12% supported and 84% opposed LGBT adoption.&lt;ref name="Eurobarometer 66"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb66/eb66_highlights_en.pdf | title=EUROBAROMETER 66 FIRST RESULTS | publisher=European Commission | work=TNS | date=December 2006 | accessdate=6 August 2014 | pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[European Social Survey]] in 2010 found that 42% of Slovaks believe that “gay men and lesbians should be free to live their own lives as they wish.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/12/eastern-and-western-europe-divided-over-gay-marriage-homosexuality/&lt;/ref&gt;

Polls suggested that only 35% of the population intended to vote in the referendum, with 85% of respondents supporting the first motion banning same sex marriage, 78% supporting a ban on LGBT adoption, and 70% supporting the third question on sex education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20053360/slovaks-are-most-tolerant-of-sexual-education-question.html|title=Slovaks are most tolerant of sexual education question|work=Slovak Spectator|date=3 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition towards the referendum questions was higher amongst students, single people, those under 35, supporters of the libertarian party [[Freedom and Solidarity]], those with openly gay family members or colleagues, people who live in more progressive town environments, and atheists and people with weaker religious beliefs.

==Results==
The referendum was deemed invalid due to low turnout, with just 21.4% of eligible voters casting votes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Referendum invalid, turnout low|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20053434/referendum-invalid-turnout-low.html|work=The Slovak Spectator|date=8 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; far short of the 50% required for the results to be legally binding.

'''Structural unemployment''' is a form of [[unemployment]] caused by a mismatch between the skills that workers in the economy can offer, and the skills demanded of workers by employers (also known as the '''skills gap''').  Structural unemployment is often brought about by technological changes that make the job skills of many of today's workers obsolete. 

Structural unemployment is one of several major categories of unemployment distinguished by [[economics|economists]], including [[frictional unemployment]], [[cyclical unemployment]], [[involuntary unemployment]], and [[classical unemployment]].

Because it requires either migration or re-training, structural unemployment can be long-term and slow to fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5955NE20091006 | work=Reuters | title=Structural unemployment crisis stalking U.S. economy | date=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes and examples ==
{{further|Technological unemployment|Productivity improving technologies (economic history)}}

From an individual perspective, structural unemployment can be due to:
* Inability to afford or decision not to pursue further education or job training
* Choice of a field of study which did not produce marketable job skills
* Inability to afford relocation
* Inability to sell a house (for example due to the collapse of a [[real estate bubble]] or of the local economy)
* Decision not to relocate, in order to stay with a spouse, family, friends, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr566.pdf Mismatch Unemployment], Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 566, June 2013; accessed 2016-06-17]&lt;/ref&gt;

From a larger perspective, there can be a number of reasons for structural unemployment across large numbers of workers:
* Technological [[obsolescence]] makes a specific expertise useless.  For example, demand for manual typesetters disappeared with digitization of printing plate production.
* [[Productivity]] increases reduce the number of workers (with the same or similar skills) needed to satisfy demand.
* New technology significantly increase productivity, but requires a fewer number of higher-skilled workers.  For example, fewer agricultural workers are needed when the work is [[mechanized agriculture|mechanized]]; those that remain must be trained to operate equipment.  Another common example is the use of [[industrial robot]]s to automate manufacturing. A study by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne found in 2013 that almost half of U.S jobs are at risk of automation.
* Competition causes the same jobs to move to a different location, and workers do not or cannot follow.  Examples:
** Manufacturing jobs in the United States moved from what are now called [[Rust Belt]] cities to lower-cost cities in the South and rural areas.
** [[Globalization]] has caused many manufacturing jobs to move from high-wage to low-wage countries.
** [[Free trade agreement]]s can cause jobs to move as competitive advantage changes.
* Political changes, for example the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]].

Large-scale changes in the economy can be particularly challenging.  For example, if a large company is the only employer in a given industry for a certain city, when it closes workers will have no competing company to move to, and the local education system and government will be burdened with many people who need job re-training all at once (possibly at the same time the local economy fails to create new jobs due to decreased overall demand).

Employers may also reject workers for reasons unrelated to skills or geography, so for example structural unemployment can also result from [[discrimination]].

While temporary changes in overall demand for labor cause [[cyclical unemployment]], structural unemployment can be caused by temporary changes in demand from different industries.  For example, [[seasonal unemployment]] often affects [[farm worker]]s after harvesting is complete, and workers in [[resort town]]s after the tourist season ends.  The [[dot-com bubble]] caused a temporary spike in demand for information technology workers, which was suddenly reversed in 2000-2001.

Structural unemployment is often associated with workers being unable to shift from industry to industry, but it can also happen within industries as technology changes the nature of work within a given field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2012/04/the-structure-of-the-structural-unemployment-question.html The structure of the structural unemployment question], Macroblog, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, April 9, 2012; accessed 2016-06-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://burning-glass.com/research/production-skills-gap/ Production Skills Gap], Burning Glass Technologies, Jan. 8, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17&lt;/ref&gt; This is a driver of skills gaps as technology and globalization "hollow out" many middle-skill jobs, positions that traditionally have not required a college degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burning-glass.com/research/middle-skills/ Bridge the Gap: Rebuilding America’s Middle Skills], Harvard Business School, Accenture, and Burning Glass Technologies, Nov. 14, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to other unemployment ==

Structural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from [[frictional unemployment]], except to say that it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to easily abolish this type of unemployment.

[[Seasonal unemployment]] may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment, since it is a type of unemployment that is linked to certain kinds of jobs (construction work, migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using "seasonal adjustment" techniques.

Structural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent [[cyclical unemployment]]: if an economy suffers from long-lasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, while their skills (including job-searching skills) become "rusty" and obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150423214253/http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/app/uploads/Long-Term-Unemployment.pdf "Long-Term Unemployment,"] Rockefeller Foundation, May 2016; accessed 2016-06-17&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with debt may lead to homelessness and a fall into the [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] of poverty. This means that they may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers. The implication is that sustained high demand may lower structural unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urban.org/research/publication/consequences-long-term-unemployment/view/full_report "Consequences of Long-Term Unemployment,"] Urban Institute, Aug. 20, 2013; accessed 2016-06-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2014/are-longterm-unemployed-margins-labor-market "Are the Long-Term Unemployed on the Margins of the Labor Market?"] Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Brookings Institution, Spring 2014; accessed 2016-06-17&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of persistence in structural unemployment has been referred to as an example of path dependence or "[[Hysteresis (economics)|hysteresis]]."

==Debates==

&lt;/div&gt; |}}
There has been considerable debate over how much a role structural unemployment plays in the persistently high unemployment rates seen in much of the world since the 2007-09 global recession. [[Narayana Kocherlakota]], then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in a 2010 speech that as much as 3 percent of the 9.5 percent unemployment rate at the time could be the result of a mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/news-and-events/presidents-speeches/inside-the-fomc "Inside the FOMC," President's Speeches, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Aug. 17, 2010; accessed 2016-06-17]&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies argued that a skills mismatch was a minor factor, since unemployment rose for nearly all industries and demographic groups during the "Great Recession."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epi.org/publication/lagging-demand-is-behind-high-long-term-unemployment/ Lagging Demand, Not Unemployability, Is Why Long-term Unemployment Remains So High], Economic Policy Institute, Aug. 19, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17&lt;/ref&gt; A Federal Reserve Bank of New York study found no strong evidence of mismatch for construction workers, a group often prone to structural unemployment because of the regional nature of construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2012/03/skills-mismatch-construction-workers-and-the-labor-market.html#.V2R1leYrL64 "Skills Mismatch, Construction Workers, and the Labor Market,"] Liberty Street Economics blog, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, March 29, 2012; accessed 2016-06-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists posit that the minimum wage is in part to blame for structural unemployment, although structural unemployment does exist even in the absence of a minimum wage. They assert that because the governmentally imposed minimum wage is higher than some individuals' [[marginal revenue product]] in any given job, that those individuals remain unemployed because employers legally cannot pay them what they are "worth."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schenk. [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON303-9.2.pdf CyberEconomics: “Overview: Resource Markets.”] Accessed June 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe that in such cases (for example, when a person is [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] or suffers a debilitating physical condition) it is the responsibility of the state to provide for the citizen in question. When a minimum wage does not exist, more people may be employed, but they may be [[underemployment|underemployed]] and thus unable to fully provide for themselves.

Management professor Peter Cappelli blames poor human resource practices for complaints that not enough qualified job applicants are found, such as replacing skilled HR workers with software that is less capable of matching resumes that exhibit the right combination of skills but without word-for-word alignment with a job posting.  (This actually may be a form of [[frictional unemployment]] if a match will eventually be made, perhaps with a different employer.)  Cappelli also points to a decrease in [[apprenticeship]]s and hiring from within an organization.  Instead, companies attempt to avoid the time and cost of on-the-job training by hiring people from who already have experience doing the same job elsewhere (including at a competitor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why Good People Can't Get Jobs: The Skills Gap and What Companies Can Do About It|isbn=978-1613630143|author=Peter Cappelli|year=2012|publisher=Wharton Digital Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ballard Farmers' Market - vegetables.jpg|thumbnail|The USFSA supports local farming and access to healthy, sufficient food.]]
The '''United States Food Sovereignty Alliance''' is a group of food producers and labor, environmental, faith-based, social justice and anti-hunger advocacy organizations,&lt;ref name="usfoodsovereigntyalliance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usfoodsovereigntyalliance.org/member-organizations/|title=USFSA|publisher=usfoodsovereigntyalliance.org|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [https://www.raceforward.org Applied Research Center], [http://familyfarmers.org/ Family Farm Defenders], the [http://www.ienearth.org/ Indigenous Environmental Network], and the [http://nffc.net/ National Family Farm Coalition]. The USFA advocates [[food sovereignty]], which is the right to sufficient and culturally appropriate food to all people and communities, and aims to reestablish better relations between food producers and consumers, placing the needs of local farmers, fishers, [[indigenous peoples]] and [[Landless Workers Movement|landless workers]] most impacted by global hunger, poverty,&lt;ref name="usfoodsovereigntyalliance2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usfoodsovereigntyalliance.org/what-is-food-sovereignty/|title=USFSA|publisher=usfoodsovereigntyalliance.org|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unbalanced food distribution above [[agribusiness]] and larger corporations. The USFA is organized into four Alliance Teams: Land &amp; Resource Grabs, Immigrant Rights &amp; Trade, Defense of Mother Earth, and Racism &amp; Leadership.&lt;ref name="usfoodsovereigntyalliance3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usfoodsovereigntyalliance.org/teams/|title=USFSA|publisher=usfoodsovereigntyalliance.org|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Food Sovereignty Alliance is a member of the International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty,&lt;ref name="foodsovereignty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsovereignty.org/about-us/|title=Food SovereigntyAbout Us - Food Sovereignty|publisher=foodsovereignty.org|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://www.rtfn-watch.org/en/home/consortium/ the Right to Food and Nutrition Watch Consortium], which includes [http://www.brot-fuer-die-welt.de “Brot für die Welt” (Bread for the world)], [http://www.fian.org FoodFirst Information and Action Network (FIAN)], and [http://www.icco.nl%20 Interchurch Organisation for Development Cooperation (ICCO)], among others. The Alliance awards the Food Sovereignty Prize annually.

==Mission statement==
The USFSA's mission, according to their founding document, is as follows:&lt;ref name="usfoodsovereigntyalliance4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usfoodsovereigntyalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/USFSA-Founding-Document-with-date.pdf|date=30 May 2013|title=Draft Founding Document for the US Food Sovereignty Alliance (USFSA)|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The US Food Sovereignty Alliance works to end poverty, rebuild local food economies, and assert democratic control over the food system. We believe all people have the right to healthy, culturally appropriate food, produced in an ecologically sound manner. As a US-based alliance of food justice, anti-hunger, labor, environmental, faith-based, and food producer groups, we uphold the right to food as a basic human right and work to connect our local and national struggles to the international movement for food sovereignty."

== History ==

The US Food Sovereignty Alliance was officially founded in 2009. The Alliance supports the concept of food sovereignty under the definition provided by [[Via Campesina|La Vía Campesina]] (LVC), which originally proposed the idea at the 1996 [[World Food Summit]].&lt;ref name="grassrootsonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grassrootsonline.org/us-food-sovereignty-alliance|title=US Food Sovereignty Alliance &amp;#124; Grassroots International|publisher=grassrootsonline.org|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of activists and supporters came together to form the  Working Group on the Food Crisis in 2008, a previous version of the Alliance, to address issues such as increasing food prices, global hunger, unequal food distribution and [[food insecurity]]. Part of this group were representatives from the National Family Farm Coalition, and members of the [[International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development]]. After a meeting in Washington, DC in 2009, the Alliance was established to mobilize and educate US and international activists on the food crisis.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/agrarianstudies/foodsovereignty/pprs/31_Anderson_2013.pdf|date=1 September 2013|author=Molly|title=INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE YALE UNIVERSITY|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance met at the [[United States Social Forum]] in 2010, and has been meeting annually ever since.

== Food Sovereignty Prize ==
The [http://foodsovereigntyprize.org/ Food Sovereignty Prize] is awarded annually to grassroots activists working for a more democratic food system. Awarded by the US Food Sovereignty Alliance, the Food Sovereignty Prize was developed to oppose the World Food Prize, which was founded by “the father of the Green Revolution,” [[Norman Borlaug]]. The Prize challenges the idea that global hunger, poverty and suffering can be alleviated purely through promoting more agribusiness and aquaculture.&lt;ref name="viacampesina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viacampesina.org/en/index.php/main-issues-mainmenu-27/food-sovereignty-and-trade-mainmenu-38/1665-u-s-farmworkers-and-palestinian-farmers-share-2014-food-sovereignty-prize|title=U.S. Farmworkers and Palestinian Farmers share 2014 Food Sovereignty Prize|publisher=viacampesina.org|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the Prize advocates for those who work to eliminate unequal distribution of wealth and resources, and overturn destructive political, economic, and social policies to open better access to food to communities in need.

The Food Sovereignty Prize is awarded to groups who are active in four areas:&lt;ref name="foodsovereigntyprize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodsovereigntyprize.org/fs-prize/|title=Food Sov Prize &amp;#124; The Prize - Food Sov Prize|publisher=foodsovereigntyprize.org|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Kingdom environmental law''' concerns the protection of the [[Natural environment|environment]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Environmental law]] is increasingly a European and an international issue, due to the cross border issues of air and water pollution, and man made [[climate change]].

==History==
In the [[common law]], the primary protection was found in the [[tort law|tort]] of [[Nuisance in English law|nuisance]], but this only allowed for private actions for damages or injunctions if there was harm to land. Thus smells emanating from [[pig sty|pig sties]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aldred's Case]]'' (1610) 9 Co Rep 57b; (1610) 77 ER 816&lt;/ref&gt; [[strict liability]] against dumping rubbish,&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Stephens]]'' (1866) LR 1 QB 702&lt;/ref&gt; or damage from exploding dams.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rylands v Fletcher]]'' [1868] UKHL 1&lt;/ref&gt; Private enforcement, however, was limited and found to be woefully inadequate to deal with major environmental threats, particularly threats to common resources. 

*1306, Edward I briefly banned coal fires in London.
*John Evelyn, ''[[Fumifugium]]'' (1661) argued for burning fragrant wood instead of mineral coal, which he believed would reduce coughing. 
*''Ballad of Gresham College'' (1661) describes how the smoke "does our lungs and spirits choke, Our hanging spoil, and rust our iron."
*In 1800, one million tons of coal were burned in London, and 15 million across the UK.
*Smoke Nuisance Abatement (Metropolis) Act 1853
*[[John Snow]] in 1854 discovered that the water pump on [[Broadwick Street|Broad Street]], [[Soho]] was responsible for 616 [[cholera]] deaths because it was contaminated by an old [[cesspit]] leaking fecal bacteria. [[Germ theory of disease]] began to replace [[miasma theory|miasma]] theory that had lingered since the [[Black Death]]. 

During the "[[Great Stink]]" of 1858, the dumping of sewerage into the [[River Thames]] began to smell so ghastly in the summer heat that Parliament had to be evacuated. The [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848]] had allowed the Metropolitan Commission for Sewers to close [[cesspit]]s around the city in an attempt to "clean up" but this simply led people to pollute the river. In 19 days, Parliament passed a further Act to build the [[London sewerage system]]. 

*[[Alkali Act 1863]] and [[Alkali Act 1874]], amended 1906

*[[James Johnston (socialist politician)]], president of the Smoke Abatement League, international conference in 1911.

London also suffered from terrible air pollution, and this culminated in the "[[Great Smog]]" of 1952, which in turn triggered its on legislative response: the [[Clean Air Act 1956]]. The basic regulatory structure was to set limits on emissions for households and business (particularly burning [[coal]]) while an inspectorate would enforce compliance. It required zones for smokeless fuel to be burned and relocated power stations.

*Clean Air Act 1968 required tall chimneys to disperse pollution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2156">The '''Universal League for the Material Elevation of the Industrious Classes''' was a 19th-century English political movement and organization.

It was founded on 14 December 1863 by [[John_Townshend,_5th_Marquess_Townshend| Marquis Townshend]], who was one of the few aristocrats to support the reform movement. It was made up of [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]] and [[trade union]] representatives. It was chaired by [[John Bedford Leno]], and its vice-presidents included [[Edmond Beales]], [[J.A. Nicholay]] and [[Captain E. Dresser Rogers]] who were all to become [[Reform League]] officials.

Its aims were ambitious and were to:
* reduce working hours
* promote franchise extension
* promote the international fraternity of workers
* increase recreational and educational opportunities

[[John_Townshend,_5th_Marquess_Townshend|Townshend]] obtained rooms at 18 Greek Street to use as the Universal League's headquarters. They were also used as the home of the [[International Working Men's Association]] a few months later.

Initial efforts concentrated on the [[Freedom of assembly|right to public assembly]] and the amendment of the [[Master and Servant Act]] but once [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] declared his conversion to parliamentary reform the League's efforts were redirected to [[suffrage]]. A Universal League Reform Committee was formed to concentrate on manhood [[suffrage]], however [[Marquis Townshend|Townshend]] objected to its formation as he feared control was being wrested from his hands. This did not go down too well with the other League members who made plans throughout the autumn and winter of 1864-5 to form a separate Reform League. As a result, the [[Reform League]] was inaugurated on the 23 February 1865, leaving the Universal League defunct.

'''Walter Duranty''' (May 25, 1884&amp;nbsp;– October 3, 1957) was a [[Liverpool]]-born, Anglo-American journalist who served as the [[Moscow]] Bureau Chief of ''[[The New York Times]]'' for fourteen years (1922–1936) following the Bolshevik victory in the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918–1921).

In 1932 Duranty received a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for a series of reports about the [[Soviet Union]], eleven of which were published in June 1931. He was criticized for his subsequent denial of [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|widespread famine (1932–1933) in the USSR]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choma|first1=Lidia|title=Holodomor Facts and History|url=http://www.holodomorct.org/history.html|ref=Uncovering the Truth}}&lt;/ref&gt; most particularly the [[Holodomor|mass starvation in Ukraine]]. Years later, there were calls to revoke his Pulitzer. In 1990, ''The New York Times'', which submitted his works for the prize in 1932, wrote that his later articles denying the famine constituted "some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meyer |first=Karl E. |authorlink=Karl E.

==Early life and career==
Duranty was born in a middle-class Merseyside family, the son of Emmeline (née Hutchins) and William Steel Duranty. His grandparents had moved to Birkenhead on the Wirral from the West Indies in 1842 and established a successful merchant business there in which his father worked. He studied at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], one of Britain's most prestigious public schools, but a sudden collapse in the family business led to a transfer to [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]]. Nevertheless, he then gained a scholarship to study at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a first-class degree.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Brennan and Elizabeth C. Clarage, ''Who's who of Pulitzer Prize Winners'', p. 71 [https://books.google.com/books?id=63nvmt4HqTEC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=Emmeline+Hutchins+Duranty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VosiR2nfEc&amp;sig=LZKWPDVUaMsurFdUJTqJu4gzgtw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mzl2UpDnAoSl2wW6oIDQBA&amp;redir_esc=y].&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his education, Duranty moved to [[Paris]]. Duranty's biographer, Sally J. Taylor, said that Duranty met [[Aleister Crowley]] and participated in magic rituals with him during this period. According to Taylor, Duranty became involved in a relationship with Crowley's mistress Jane Cheron, and eventually married her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Sally J. | author-link = &lt;!--Sally J. Taylor--&gt; | title=Stalin's Apologist | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | date=1990 | pages=28–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley called Walter Duranty "my old friend" and quoted from Duranty's book "I Write as I Please" in his book ''[[Magick Without Tears]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowley|first1=Aleister|title=Magick Without Tears|date=1954|publisher=Ordo Templi Orientis|page=38|url=http://www.leary.ru/download/crowley/Crowley,%20Aleister%20-%20Magic%20Without%20Tears.pdf|access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War I|Great War]], Duranty first worked as a reporter for ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Sally J. | author-link = &lt;!--Sally J. Taylor--&gt; | title=Stalin's Apologist | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; A story Duranty filed about the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] gained him wider notice as a journalist. He then moved to [[Riga]], the capital of [[Latvia]], to cover events in the newly independent [[Baltic states]].

==Career in Moscow, 1922–1934==
Duranty moved to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921.

On holiday in France in 1924, Duranty's left leg was injured in a train wreck. After the operation, the surgeon discovered [[gangrene]]; and the leg was amputated. Once he had recovered, Duranty resumed his career as a [[journalist]] in the Soviet Union. During the [[New Economic Policy]] with its mixed economy, Duranty's articles from Moscow did not draw wide attention. It was after the advent of the [[first five-year plan]] (1928–1933), which aimed to transform Soviet industry and agriculture, that Duranty made his mark.

In 1929, he was granted an exclusive interview with [[Joseph Stalin]] that greatly enhanced his reputation as a journalist. Duranty was to remain in Moscow for twelve years, settling in the United States in 1934. Thereafter, he remained on [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which required him to spend several months a year in [[Moscow]]. It was in this capacity that Duranty reported on the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] of Stalin's political opponents in 1936–1938.

===Views on the Soviet Union, 1931 and after===
In the 1931 series of reports for which he received the 1932 [[Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence]], Duranty argued that the Russian people were "[[Culture of Asia|Asiatic]]" in thought: they valued communal effort and required [[Autocracy|autocratic government]]. [[Individualism|Individuality]] and [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] were alien concepts to the Russian people, which only led to social disruption and were unacceptable to them just as [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[Communism]] were unacceptable to the [[Western world]].

Failed attempts, since the time of [[Peter the Great]], to apply Western ideals in [[Russia]] were a form of European [[colonialism]], he wrote, that had been finally swept away by the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Revolution]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] and his [[New Economic Policy]] were both failures tainted by Western thought. Duranty felt that Stalin scrapped the [[New Economic Policy]] because he had no political competition. The famine in [[Ukraine]] demonstrated the lack of organized opposition to Stalin, because his position was never truly threatened by the catastrophe; Stalin's purges surely contributed to this political vacuum. Stalin succeeded in doing what Lenin could only attempt to do, i.e., he "re-established a dictator of the [[Imperialism|imperial]] idea and put himself in charge" by means of intimidation. "Stalin didn't look upon himself as a dictator, but as a 'guardian of a sacred flame' that he called [[Stalinism]] for lack of a better name."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: [[Viking Press]], 1934)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Stalin's five-year plan]] was an attempt to effect a new way of life for the Russian people.

Duranty argued that the Soviet Union's mentality in 1931 greatly differed from the perception created by [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Duranty claimed: "It would be more proper to refer to the principle present during the period of Stalin's reign as 'Stalinism'",&lt;ref&gt;Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: Viking Press, 1934), 238.&lt;/ref&gt; which Duranty viewed as a progression and integration of [[Marxism]] combined with [[Leninism]]. In one of the articles submitted for the Pulitzer Prize ("Stalinism smashes foes in Marx's name", 24 June 1931) Duranty gives his views of the Soviet actions in the countryside that eventually led to the famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duranty |first=Walter |url=http://www.garethjones.org/soviet_articles/duranty_1931_8.htm |title=Stalinism Smashes Foes in Marx's Name |publisher=''The New York Times'' |website=Garethjones.org |date=June 24, 1931 |access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;what is happening now to the Kulaks is leading to the same result—the kulaks who, under Leninism were an almost privileged class, encouraged to work and prosper (did not Bukharin then Leninism's chief spokesman, ... once say to the peasants, "Enrich yourselves," that is, become kulaks better than—or a different class from—your fellows by individual, self—helping effort?) "The liquidation of the kulak as a class" runs the present slogan whose meaning in terms of reality is that 5,000,000 human beings, 1,000,000 families of the best and most energetic farmers are to be dispossessed, dispersed, demolished, to be literally melted or "liquidated" into the rising flood of classless proletarians.

Here, when you get right down to it, is the supreme justification from the Bolshevik angle of the cruel and often bloody pressure upon "the former People" or class enemies from Czar to kulak. Where Marxism theorized Stalin acts. Marxism says, "Eliminate class distinctions" and Stalinism does so by the simple and effective process of destructions, as Tamerlane destroyed his enemies or the Hebrew prophet [Samuel] slew for the glory of Jehovah.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duranty sometimes claimed that individuals being sent to the [[labor camp]]s in the Russian North, Siberia or Kazakhstan were given a choice between rejoining [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] society or becoming underprivileged outsiders. However, he also said that, for those who could not accept the system, "the final fate of such enemies is death". Though describing the system as cruel, he said he has "no brief for or against it, nor any purpose save to try to tell the truth". He ends the article with the claim that the brutal collectivization campaign was motivated by the "hope or promise of a subsequent raising up" of Asian-minded masses in the Soviet Union which only history could judge.

Rather than just repeating the Stalinist viewpoint, Duranty often admitted the brutality of the Stalinist system then proceeded to both explain and defend why dictatorship or brutality were necessary. In addition, he repeated Soviet views as his own opinion, as if his 'observations' from Moscow had given him deeper insights into the country as a whole.

Duranty's motivations have been hotly debated and his reporting is faulted for being too uncritical of the USSR, presenting Soviet propaganda as legitimate reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/us/times-should-lose-pulitzer-from-30-s-consultant-says.html|title=Times Should Lose Pulitzer From 30's, Consultant Says|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=October 23, 2003|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his praise of Joseph Stalin as an imperial, national, "authentically Russian" dictator to be compared to [[Ivan the Terrible]], Duranty was expressing views similar to those of some [[White émigré|White (Russian) émigrés]] during the same period,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mit.edu/people/fjk/Rogovin/volume6/xiii.html Роговин, В.З. «Была ли альтернатива». Том 6. XIII. Сталин и сталинизм глазами белой эмиграции]&lt;/ref&gt; namely the [[Smenovekhovtsy|Smenovekhovtsy movement]], echoing still earlier hopes by the [[Eurasianism|Eurasianism movement]] and the [[Mladorossi|Mladorossi group]] currents in the 1920s. (Of course, Stalin was not [[Russians|Russian]], but [[Georgians|Georgian]], with distant [[Ossetians|Ossetian]] ancestry&amp;nbsp;— his paternal great-grandfather was an Ossetian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/03/costabookawards2007.costabookaward1 |title=Costa book awards 2007: Young Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore |publisher=The Guardian |date=January 3, 2008 |access-date=September 30, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901091928/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/03/costabookawards2007.costabookaward1 |archivedate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a fact that he himself downplayed during his lifetime.)

In 1933, Stalin rewarded this praise and appreciation by saying that Duranty tried "to tell the truth about our country".&lt;ref name="TimesEditorial"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0DC103FF937A15755C0A966958260 "The Editorial Notebook; Trenchcoats, Then and Now"].  ''[[The New York Times]]'' editorial on Walter Duranty, 1990-06-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reporting the 1932–1933 famine===
In ''The New York Times'' on 31 March 1933, Walter Duranty denounced reports of a famine and, in particular, he attacked [[Gareth Jones (journalist)|Gareth Jones]], a British journalist who had witnessed the starving in Ukraine and issued a widely published press release about their plight two days earlier in Berlin. (Jones' release was itself immediately preceded by three unsigned articles describing the famine in the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Muggeridge, ''Chronicles of Wasted Time. Vol 1, The Green Stick'', London: Fontana (pbk), p. 286. The articles appeared on 25, 27 and 28 March 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the title "Russians Hungry, But Not Starving" Duranty's article described the situation as follows:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the middle of the diplomatic duel between Great Britain and the Soviet Union over the accused British engineers, there appears from a British source a big scare story in the American press about famine in the Soviet Union, with "thousands already dead and millions menaced by death from starvation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "diplomatic duel" was a reference to the arrest of engineers from the [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] company who were working in the USSR. Accused with Soviet citizens of "wrecking" (sabotaging) the plant they were building, they were the subjects of one in a series of show trials presided over by [[Andrey Vyshinsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Gordon W. Morrell, ''Britain confronts the Stalin Revolution: the Metro-Vickers crisis'', Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; during the First Five Year Plan.

Five months later (23 August 1933), in another ''New York Times'' article, Duranty wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda. The food shortage, however, which has affected the whole population in the last year and particularly in the grain-producing provinces&amp;nbsp;— the Ukraine, [[North Caucasus Krai|North Caucasus]] [i.e. Kuban Region], and the [[Volga region|Lower Volga]]&amp;nbsp;— has, however, caused heavy loss of life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duranty concluded "it is conservative to suppose" that, in certain provinces with a total population of over 40 million, mortality had "at least trebled." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&amp;pg=PA573&amp;dq=The+food+shortage+which+has+affected+almost+the+whole+population+in+the+last+year,+and+particularly+in+the+grain-producing+provinces&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20food%20shortage%20which%20has%20affected%20almost%20the%20whole%20population%20in%20the%20last%20year%2C%20and%20particularly%20in%20the%20grain-producing%20provinces&amp;f=false ''Assignment in Utopia'' By Eugene Lyons].&lt;/ref&gt; The duel in the press over the famine stories did not damage esteem for Duranty. ''[[The Nation]]'' then described his reporting as "the most enlightened, dispassionate dispatches from a great nation in the making which appeared in any newspaper in the world."&lt;ref name=ConqRav&gt;Conquest, R. ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'', Oxford University Press, New York. 1986, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following sensitive negotiations in November 1933 that resulted in the establishment of relations between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]], a dinner was given for Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] in New York City's [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. Each of the attendees' names was read in turn, politely applauded by the guests, until Duranty's. Whereupon, [[Alexander Woollcott]] wrote, "the one really prolonged pandemonium was evoked ... Indeed, one quite got the impression that America, in a spasm of discernment, was recognizing both Russia and Walter Duranty."&lt;ref name="ConqRav" /&gt;

Sally J. Taylor, author of the critical Duranty biography ''Stalin's Apologist'', argues that his reporting from the USSR was a key factor in U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1933 decision to grant official recognition to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt;

==Later career==
In 1934, Duranty left Moscow and visited the [[White House]] in the company of Soviet officials, including Litvinov. He continued as a Special Correspondent for ''The New York Times'' until 1940.

He wrote several books on the Soviet Union after 1940. His name was on a [[Orwell's list|list maintained by writer George Orwell]] of those Orwell considered to be unsuitable as possible writers for the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]'s [[Information Research Department]] owing to the possibility of them being too sympathetic to communism or possibly paid communist agents.&lt;ref&gt;John Ezard [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities ''Blair's babe: Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge?''] ''The Guardian'', June 21, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Duranty died in [[Orlando, Florida]] in 1957 and is interred at Greenwood Cemetery.

==Scholarship on Duranty's work==
Duranty was reporting at a time when opinions were strongly divided on the Soviet Union and its leadership.

The admission of the USSR to the [[League of Nations]] in 1934 was viewed optimistically by some. Others saw an inevitable confrontation between [[fascism]] and [[communism]] as requiring individuals to take one side or the other. After [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], [[Joseph E. Davies]], former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1936–1938), wrote positively about "Russia and its people in their gallant struggle to preserve the peace until ruthless aggression made war inevitable". In the same book he referred to Stalin as a "decent and clean-living" man and "a great leader."&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Joseph E. ''Mission to Moscow''. Garden City Publishing, Garden City, NY, 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

Many reporters of Duranty's time slanted their coverage in favour of the Soviet Union. Some drew a contrast with the capitalist world, sinking under the weight of the [[Great Depression]]; others wrote out of a true belief in Communism; some acted out of fear of being expelled from [[Moscow]], which would result in a loss of livelihood. At home many of their editors found it hard to believe a state would deliberately starve millions of its own people. Duranty's reports for ''The New York Times'' were a source of much frustration for the paper's readers in 1932, because they directly contradicted the line taken on the paper's own [[editorial]] page.&lt;ref name="TimesEditorial" /&gt;

===The Holodomor (1932-1933) and the 1938 Moscow Show Trials===
Duranty has been criticized for deferring to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s official [[propaganda]] rather than reporting news, both when he was living in Moscow and later. For example, he later defended Stalin's [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trials of 1938]], which were staged to eliminate potential challengers to Stalin's authority.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 1968, p. //.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major controversy regarding his work remains his reporting on the great famine of 1932–33 that struck certain parts of the USSR after agriculture was forcibly and rapidly "collectivised". He published reports stating "there is no famine or actual starvation nor is there likely to be" and "any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/pulitzer-winning-lies/article/4040 Pulitzer-Winning Lies] the Weekly Standard&lt;/ref&gt; In Ukraine, the region most affected, this man-made disaster is today known as the [[Holodomor]].

Since the late 1960s, Duranty's work has come increasingly under fire for failing to report the famine. [[Robert Conquest]] was critical of Duranty's reporting in ''The Great Terror'' (1968), ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]'' (1986) and, most recently, in ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (1990). [[Joseph Alsop]] and Andrew Stuttaford spoke out against Duranty during the Pulitzer Prize controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Stuttaford|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/stuttaford/stuttaford050703.asp|title=Prize Specimen – The campaign to revoke Walter Duranty's Pulitzer|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=7 May 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030519230426/http://www.nationalreview.com/stuttaford/stuttaford050703.asp|archivedate=19 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Lying was Duranty's stock in trade," commented Alsop. In his memoirs British journalist [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], then ''The Manchester Guardian''{{'}}s correspondent in Moscow, talked of Duranty's "persistent lying" &lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Muggeridge, ''Chronicles of Wasted Time: Vol 1 The Green Stick'', London: Fontana (pbk), 1975, pp. 282–285.&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere called him "the greatest liar I ever knew.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-06-25/features/0306240411_1_walter-duranty-famine-ukraine|title = Bearing Witness|last = Leroux|first = Charles|date = 25 June 2003|work = Chicago Tribune|access-date = 26 April 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===What Duranty knew and when===
It was clear, meanwhile, from Duranty's comments to others that he was fully aware of the scale of the calamity. In 1934 he privately reported to the British embassy in Moscow that as many as 10 million people may have died, directly or indirectly, from famine in the Soviet Union in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/05/fellow-travellers-and-useful-idiots "Fellow travelers and useful idiots", ''The New Statesman'', 8 May 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jQcPAQAAMAAJ ''The Foreign Office and the famine: British documents on Ukraine and the Great Famine of 1932–1933''] (Studies in East European nationalisms). "Duranty&amp;nbsp;... manipulated the official palaver so successfully that it was possible to interpret his article in several ways", p. xxx.&lt;/ref&gt; and American engineer Zara Witkin (1900–1940),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joyce |last=Ingraham |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9951419 |title=Zara Witkin |publisher=Findagrave.com |date=November 23, 2004 |access-date=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked in the USSR from 1932 to 1934,&lt;ref&gt;''An American Engineer in Stalin's Russia: The Memoirs of Zara Witkin, 1932–1934'', University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that Duranty knowingly misrepresented information about the nature and scale of the famine.

There are some indications that Duranty's deliberate misdirection concerning the famine may have been the result of duress. Conquest believed Duranty was being blackmailed over his sexual proclivities.&lt;ref&gt;P. Murphy, ''The Collective Imagination: The Creative Spirit of Free Societies'', Ashgate Publishing, 2012, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1944 book, Duranty speaks in a chastened tone about his 1932–34 reporting, but he offers only a Stalinist defense of it.&lt;ref name="Duranty_1944_pp188-199"&gt;{{Harvnb|Duranty|1944|pp=188–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; He admits that people starved, including not just "class enemies" but also loyal communists,&lt;ref name="Duranty_1944_pp188-199"/&gt; but he says that Stalin was forced to order the requisitions to equip the Red Army enough to deter an imminent Japanese invasion&lt;ref name="Duranty_1944_pp188-199"/&gt; (a reprise of the [[Siberian Intervention]] of a decade earlier)—in other words, to save the Soviet Union from impending military doom, not because Stalin wanted to collectivize the population at gunpoint, on pain of death.&lt;ref name="Duranty_1944_pp188-199"/&gt; Although it is likely that Stalin ''did'' expect a Japanese invasion (expecting foreign attacks all the time), historians today do not accept the view that it was his ''sole'' motivation and that Stalin did not intend any cruel and ruthless political dominance of the Soviet population. Of the notion that Stalin did intend the latter, Duranty said, "What a misconception!"&lt;ref name="Duranty_1944_pp188-199"/&gt; But today that assertion of "misconception" is itself well established to be at best a self-delusion and at worst a knowing repetition of false Stalinist propaganda, the falsehood being demonstrable today in light of reams of evidence now publicly available (in the [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|post–Secret Speech]] and [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|post-Soviet]] eras) but not publicly available in 1944.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Calls for revocation of Pulitzer Prize, 1990–2003==
The concern over Duranty's reporting on the famine in Soviet Ukraine led to a move to posthumously and symbolically strip him of the Pulitzer Prize he received in 1932.

In response to ''Stalin's Apologist'' (1990), the critical biography by Sally J. Taylor,&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; ''The New York Times'' assigned a member of its editorial board, Karl Meyer, to write a signed editorial about Duranty's work for the ''Times''. In a scathing piece, Meyer said (24 June 1990) that Duranty's articles were "some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper." Duranty, Meyer said, had bet his career on Stalin's rise and "strove to preserve it by ignoring or excusing Stalin's crimes."&lt;ref name="TimesEditorial" /&gt; The Pulitzer Board in 1990 reconsidered the prize but decided to preserve it as awarded.&lt;ref&gt;anon, ''[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm N.Y. Times Urged to Rescind 1932 Pulitzer]'', in ''USA Today'', October 22, 2003, as accessed April 16, 2016 (article authored by The Associated Press (copyright 2005 (unknown if revised in 2005))). Mentioned, without decision date, in anon, ''[http://www.nytco.com/new-york-times-statement-about-1932-pulitzer-prize-awarded-to-walter-duranty/ New York Times Statement About 1932 Pulitzer Prize Awarded to Walter Duranty]'', as accessed April 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years earlier, in a review of [[Robert Conquest]]'s ''The Harvest of Sorrow'' (1986), former Moscow bureau reporter Craig Whitney wrote that Duranty effectively ignored the famine until it was almost over.

In 2003, following an international campaign by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Pulitzer Board began a renewed inquiry, and ''The New York Times'' hired [[Mark von Hagen]], professor of Russian history at [[Columbia University]], to review Duranty's work as a whole. Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[propaganda]]. In comments to the press he stated, "For the sake of ''The New York Times''{{'}} honor, they should take the prize away."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm "N.Y. Times urged to rescind 1932 Pulitzer"], retrieved February 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' sent von Hagen's report to the Pulitzer Board and left it to the Board to take whatever action they considered appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Reported in ''The Washington Times'' "National" section, October 22, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter accompanying the report, ''The New York Times'' publisher [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]] called Duranty's work "slovenly" and said it "should have been recognized for what it was by his editors and by his Pulitzer judges seven decades ago."

Ultimately, Sig Gissler, administrator of the Pulitzer Prize board, declined to revoke the award. In a press release of November 21, 2003, he stated that with regard to the 13 articles by Duranty from 1931 submitted for the award "there was not clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception, the relevant standard in this case."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/news/statement-walter-duranty "Statement on Walter Duranty's 1932 Prize"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1768">The '''Wendish People's Party''' ({{lang-de|Wendische Volkspartei}}, {{lang-hsb|Serbska ludowa strona}}) was a political party of the [[Sorbs]] in [[Weimar Germany]] from 1919 to 1933. It was led by [[Jakub Lorenc-Zalěski]] during its entire existence.

==History==
The party was originally known as the '''Lusatian People's Party''' (''Lausitzer Volkspartei''). It ran in the [[German federal election, 1920|1920 federal elections]], but received just 0.03% of the vote and failed to win a seat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonschior.de/weimar/Deutschland/RT1.html Wahl zum 1. Reichstag] Gonschior.de&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[German federal election, May 1924|May 1924 elections]] the party had changed its name to the Wendish People's Party. It ran as part of the [[Association of National Minorities in Germany|National Minorities Alliance]], but again failed to win a seat, receiving just 0.04% of the national vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonschior.de/weimar/Deutschland/RT2.html Wahl zum 2. Reichstag] Gonschior.de&lt;/ref&gt;
