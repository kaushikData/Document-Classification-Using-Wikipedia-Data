      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">'''Anecdotal cognitivism''' is a psychological methodology that attributes mental states to animals on the basis of anecdotes and on the observation of particular cases, other than those observations made during controlled experiments. It is opposed to [[behaviorism]]; behaviorists are critical of anecdotal cognitivism, suggesting that controlled experiments are necessary to measure stimuli and record observable behavior. 

==Animal cognition==
Anecdotal cognitivism is often criticized by behaviorists using specific cases, such as that of [[Clever Hans]], to discredit using anecdotal evidence in assessing [[animal cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf|title=Anthropomorphism, primatomorphism, mammalomorphism: understanding cross-species comparisons|last=Keeley|first=Brian L.|date=2004|publisher=York University|pages=527|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081217060503/http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf| archivedate= 17 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Clever Hans, a [[horse]] was purported to be able to add and subtract using its hooves, and even answer questions surrounding [[European politics]], but it was determined by later research that the horse's owner was, in fact, unknowingly cueing the [[horse]], and that when he was removed from the room, the [[horse]] would not respond.

Anecdotal cognitivists respond to behaviorists by saying that [[behaviorism]] would have the animals 'lose their minds' and that it is clear that, by observation, they can know a great deal about the cognitive processes of animals. They add that the debate can start with simple observation, rather than in a controlled setting or in a lab.

&lt;/ref&gt; It has been prepared from [[MRI|diffusion MRI]] datasets of the [[Human Connectome Project]] into a reference connectome (or brain [[Chart|graph]]), which can be downloaded in CSV and GraphML formats and visualized on the site in 3D.

==Features==
The Budapest Reference Connectome has 1015 nodes, corresponding to anatomically identified gray matter areas. The user can set numerous parameters and the resulting consensus connectome is readily visualized on the webpage &lt;ref name="bpconn3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Users can zoom, rotate, and query the anatomical label of the nodes on the graphical component.

==Background==

Budapest Reference Connectome is a consensus graph of the brain graphs of 96 subjects in Version 2 and 418 subjects in Version 3. Only those edges are returned which are present in a given percentage of the subjects. Each of the selected edges has a certain weight in each of the graphs containing that edge, so these multiple weights are combined into a single weight, by taking either their mean (i.e., average) or median. The user interface allows the customization of these parameters: the user can select the minimum frequency of the edges returned. There is an option for viewing and comparing the female or male reference connectomes. The connectomes of women contain significantly more edges than those of men, and a larger portion of the edges in the connectomes of women run between the two hemispheres.&lt;ref name="IngalhalikarSmith2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ingalhalikar|first1=M.|last2=Smith|first2=A.|last3=Parker|first3=D.|last4=Satterthwaite|first4=T.

==Discoveries==

The Budapest Reference Connectome has led the researchers to the discovery of the Consensus Connectome Dynamics of the human [[connectome|brain graphs]]. The edges appeared in all of the brain graphs form a connected subgraph around the [[brainstem]]. By allowing gradually less frequent edges, this core subgraph grows continuously, as a [[shrub]]. The growth dynamics may reflect the individual [[brain development]] and provide an opportunity to direct some edges of the human consensus brain graph.&lt;ref name="Kerepesi2016"&gt;

'''Canal lining''' is the process of reducing seepage loss of [[irrigation]] water by adding an impermeable layer to the edges of the trench. Seepage can result in losses of 30 to 50 percent of irrigation water from canals, so adding lining can make irrigation systems more efficient. [[Canal]] linings are also used to prevent weed growth, which can spread throughout an irrigation system and reduce water flow. Lining a canal can also prevent [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] around low-lying areas of the canal.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noRRvsBZzBsC|title=Irrigation Engineering|last=Basak|date=1999-10-01|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780074635384|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By making a canal less permeable, the water velocity increases resulting in a greater overall discharge. Increased velocity also reduces the amount of evaporation and silting that occurs, making the canal more efficient.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The oldest known paved canal was discovered in 1995 near the pyramids of Giza, and is estimated to be around 4,500 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-10-30/news/9510300094_1_canal-giza-nile|title=Oldest Paved Canal Uncovered In Egypt|website=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canal lining types==

=== Concrete ===

Concrete canal lining is often used due to its high structural strength and longevity. Concrete used for canal lining is typically non-reinforced, as a way to reduce cost. A common method for constructing concrete lining is the use of [[Slip forming|slip forms]], which are drawn down the length of the canal as the concrete is poured.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDvuqawJDI4C|title=Irrigation: Theory and Practice|last=Michael|first=A. M.|date=2009-11-01|publisher=Vikas Publishing House Pvt Ltd|isbn=9788125918677|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand laying of concrete or prefabricated sections are also used when only a short distance needs to be covered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Certain additives, such as kankar lime and surkhi, are sometimes included in the concrete mixture to improve water retention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Prior to constructing concrete linings, it is common practice to ensure the sub-grade layer of soil is adequately consolidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQFSAAAAMAAJ|title=Irrigation canal lining|last=Kraatz|first=D. B.|date=1977-01-01|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|isbn=9789251001653|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; If expansive clay is located on the site of a canal, a layer of this clay is removed and replaced with sand or gravel before the concrete lining is constructed. This removal minimizes the risk of ground swelling, which can cause cracking in the concrete. In order to prevent cracking during the curing process, water is sprinkled on the concrete or a damp cover is placed over the lining. Another preventative measure against cracking, includes adding transverse and longitudinal grooves or expansion joints which help absorb cracking that may occur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Compacted soil ===

Compacted clay is a simple form of soil canal lining, which serves as a relatively cheap alternative to other methods. Certain clays, such as [[bentonite]], have high water absorption but then become impervious, which makes them an ideal soil lining. It has been shown through studies done in the U.S., that a layer of [[bentonite]] 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;cm thick, underneath a layer of earth 15 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm thick, makes for an adequate lining system. Typically, porous soils are removed before compacted clay is applied to the bed and sides of a canal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another simple method of canal lining with soils entails applying a layer of compacted silt on top of the [[subgrade]] of the canal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of soils as canal linings is efficient for controlling seepage, but not effective against weed growth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Plastic membrane ===

Plastic linings are often referred to as [[geomembrane]]s or flexible membrane linings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ocw.usu.edu/Biological_and_Irrigation_Engineering/Irrigation___Conveyance_Control_Systems/6300__L19_CanalLinings.pdf|title=Canal Linings|last=Gary|first=Merkley|date=2016-03-28|website=Utah State University|publisher=Utah State University|access-date=http://ocw.usu.edu/Biological_and_Irrigation_Engineering/Irrigation___Conveyance_Control_Systems/6300__L19_CanalLinings.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic linings are often covered with soil, rocks, brick, concrete or other material. This is done in order to anchor the lining down and to protect it from deterioration and disintegration. Plastic membranes are very thin, varying in thickness from 8 up to 100 thousandths of an inch.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE) film, similar to the material used in trash bags, is a common type of plastic membrane used. Plastic linings are also used as a method of retrofitting damaged concrete linings.

== Potential damage to canal linings ==
Since canal linings are exposed to the elements and are in constant use, they are susceptible to damage over time. Geotechnical considerations are often ignored in designing canal linings due to the light weight of the structure. Concrete canal linings often experience cracking, which can be expensive to repair. Cracking can occur through several ways, starting during construction if the concrete is cured improperly. Cracking can also occur due to movement of the soil, which can be caused by [[Frost heaving|frost heave]] or the swelling of expansive soils. Expansive soils, such as certain types of clay, may swell as a result of canal discharge, changing climates or transpiration.  A common method to reduce future swelling in expansive soils is to subject the soil to wetting and drying cycles prior to construction of the lining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unsaturated Soils: Research and Applications Volume 2|last=Bonab|first=Masoud|last2=Sarand|first2=Fariba|last3=Farrin|first3=Majid|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-3-642-31343-1|location=|pages=308‚Äì314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lab testing has shown that subjecting a clayey soil to wetting and drying cycles leads to a [[hysteresis]] of shrinkage in the soil, significantly reducing its free swelling potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmadi|first=Hojjat|last2=Rahimi|first2=Hassan|last3=Rostami|first3=Maryam|date=16 April 2012|title=Control of Swelling of Soil Under Canal Lining by Wetting and Drying Cycles|doi=10.1002/ird.1666|journal=Irrigation and Drainage|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dispersive soils, such as fine graded sands, can also pose a threat to concrete canal linings since they erode when in contact with flowing water, which can cause [[Soil mechanics|piping]]. As a way to reduce the potential for this contact to occur, geomembrane sheets can be installed underneath concrete linings, thus reducing the amount of water that may seep through the canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahimi|first=Hassan|last2=Abbasi|first2=Nader|last3=Shantia|first3=Hassan|date=30 July 2010|title=Application of Geomembrane to Control Piping of Sandy Soil Under Concrete Canal Lining|doi=10.1002/ird.574|journal=Irrigation and Drainage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2621">'''Christian comedy''' is a subgenre of [[comedy]] where the material presented is aimed towards a Christian audience. The performances are typically held on church grounds or at off-site, church-sponsored venues.

The material often contains Christian references, although this is not a requirement. Recently, notable performers like [[Victoria Jackson]], [[Tim Conway]], [[Sinbad (entertainer)|Sinbad]] and [[Patricia Heaton]] have appeared on a DVD series for the Christian market entitled, "Thou Shalt Laugh"&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoushaltlaugh.com/ Thou Shalt Laugh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223151828/http://www.thoushaltlaugh.com/ |date=2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian comedy is increasingly being used as an [[outreach]], with the idea that a comedy show is a great way to bring people into church who may have never thought about coming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larryweaver.com/entertainment/christian-comedians.asp Christian Comedians]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian comedy is also used as a method to renew and refresh the spirit of church members, based on the Bible passage that says laughter does a heart good, like medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancomedyacts.com Christian Comedy Acts]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Church history''' or '''ecclesiastical history''' as an [[academic discipline]] studies the [[history of Christianity]] and the way the [[Christian Church]] has developed since its inception. 

[[Henry Melvill Gwatkin]] defined church history as "the spiritual side of the history of civilized people ever since our Master's coming".&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Melvill Gwatkin]], ''Early Church History to A.D. 313'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A. M. Renwick, however, defines it as an account of the Church's success and failure in carrying out Christ's [[Great Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Renwick and [[Allan Harman|A. M. Harman]], ''The Story of the Church'' (3rd ed.), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Renwick suggests a fourfold division of church history into [[Mission (Christianity)|missionary activity]], [[Ecclesiastical polity|church organization]], [[Christian theology|doctrine]] and "the effect on human life".

Church history is often, but not always, studied from a Christian perspective. Writers from different Christian traditions will often highlight people and events particularly relevant to their own [[denominational]] history. Catholic and Orthodox writers often highlight the achievements of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]], while [[evangelical]] historians may focus on the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Great Awakening]]s.

== 2. Geometric Modeling Principles ==
For the calculation strategy of CASTp, alpha-shape and discrete-flow methods are applied to the protein binding site, also the measurement of pocket size by the program of CAST by Liang et al in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edelsbrunner|first=Herbert|last2=Facello|first2=Michael|last3=Liang|first3=Jie|date=1998-11|title=On the definition and the construction of pockets in macromolecules|journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics|volume=88|issue=1‚Äì3|pages=83‚Äì102|doi=10.1016/s0166-218x(98)00067-5|issn=0166-218X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liang|first=Jie|last2=Woodward|first2=Clare|last3=Edelsbrunner|first3=Herbert|date=1998-09|title=Anatomy of protein pockets and cavities: Measurement of binding site geometry and implications for ligand design|journal=Protein Science|volume=7|issue=9|pages=1884‚Äì1897|doi=10.1002/pro.5560070905|pmid=9761470|pmc=2144175|issn=0961-8368}}&lt;/ref&gt; then updated by Tian et al in 2018. Firstly, CAST identifies atoms which form the protein pocket, then calculates the volume and area, identifies the atoms forming the rims of pocket mouth, computes how many mouth openings for each pocket, predict the area and circumference of mouth openings, finally locates cavities and calculate their size. The secondary structures were calculated by DSSP. The single amino acid annotations were fetched from UniProt database,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UniProt¬†Consortium|first=The|date=2018-02-07|title=UniProt: the universal protein knowledgebase|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky092|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=46|issue=5|pages=2699|doi=10.1093/nar/gky092|pmid=29425356|pmc=5861450|issn=0305-1048}}&lt;/ref&gt; then mapped to PDB structures following residue-level information from SIFTS database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Velankar|first=Sameer|last2=Dana|first2=Jos√© M.|last3=Jacobsen|first3=Julius|last4=van Ginkel|first4=Glen|last5=Gane|first5=Paul J.|last6=Luo|first6=Jie|last7=Oldfield|first7=Thomas J.|last8=O‚ÄôDonovan|first8=Claire|last9=Martin|first9=Maria-Jesus|date=2012-11-29|title=SIFTS: Structure Integration with Function, Taxonomy and Sequences resource|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks1258|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=41|issue=D1|pages=D483‚ÄìD489|doi=10.1093/nar/gks1258|pmid=23203869|pmc=3531078|issn=0305-1048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 4. Why CASTp is Useful? ==
'''4.1 Protein science, from an amino acid to sequences and structures'''

Proteins are large, complex molecules that playing critical roles to maintain the normal functioning of the human body. They are essential not just for the structure and function, but also the regulation among the body‚Äôs tissues and organs. Proteins are made up of hundreds of smaller units called amino acids that are attached to one another by peptide bonds, forming a long chain.

'''4.2 Protein active sites'''

Usually, the active site of a protein locates on its center of action and, the key to its function. The first step is the detection of active sites on the protein surface and an exact description of their features and boundaries. These specifications are vital inputs for subsequent target druggability prediction or target comparison. Most of the algorithms for active site detection are based on geometric modeling or energetic features based calculation.

'''4.3 The role of protein pockets'''

The shape and properties of the protein surface determine what interactions are possible with ligands and other macromolecules. Pockets are an important yet ambiguous feature of this surface. During drug discovery process, the first step in screening for lead compounds and potential molecules as drugs is usually a selection of the shape of the binding pocket. Shape plays a role in many computational pharmacological methods. Based on existing results, most features important to predicting drug-binding were depended on size and shape of the binding pocket, with the chemical properties of secondary importance. The surface shape is also important for interactions between protein and water. However, defining discrete pockets or possible interaction sites still remains unclear, due to the shape and location of nearby pockets affected promiscuity and diversity of binding sites. Since most pockets are open to solvent, to define the border of a pocket is the primary difficulty. Those closed to solvent we refer to as buried cavities. With the benefit of well-defined extent, area and volume, buried cavities are more straightforward to locate. In contrast, the border of an open pocket defines its mouth and it provides the cut-off for determination of the surface area and volume. Even defining the pocket as a set of residues does not define the volume or the mouth of the pocket.

'''4.4 Druggability role prediction'''

In pharmaceutical industry, the current priority strategy for target assessment is high-throughput screening (HTS). NMR screenings are applied against large compound datasets. Chemical characteristics of compounds binding against specific targets are measured, so how well the compound sets bind to the chemical space will decide the binding efficiency. Success rates of virtually docking of the drug-like ligands into the active sites of the target proteins would be detected for prioritization, while the most of the active sites located at the pockets.

With the benefits of large amount of structural data, computational methods from different perspectives for druggability prediction have been introduced during the last 30 years with positive results, as a vital instrument to accelerate the prediction accessibility. ¬†Many candidates have been integrated into drug discovery pipeline already since then.

==5. New Features in CASTp 3.0==
'''5.1 Pre-computed results for biological assemblies'''

For a lot of proteins deposited in Protein Data Bank, the asymmetric unit might be different from biological unit, which would make the computational result biologically irrelevant. So the new CASTp 3.0 computed the topological features for biological assemblies, overcome the barriers between asymmetric unit and biological assemblies.

'''5.2 Imprints of negative volumes of topological features'''

In the 1st release of CASTp server in 2006, only geometric and topological features of those surface atoms participated in the formation of protein pockets, cavities, and channels. The new CASTp added the ‚Äúnegative volume‚Äù of the space, referred to the space encompassed by the atoms formed these geometric and topological features.

'''5.3 Comprehensive annotation on single amino-acid polymorphism'''

The latest CASTp integrated protein annotations aligned with the sequence, including the brief feature, positions, description, and reference of the domains, motifs, and single amino-acid polymorphisms.

'''5.4 Improved user interface &amp; convenient visualization'''

The new CASTp now incorporated 3Dmol.js for structural visualization, made users able to browse, to interact the protein 3D model, and to examine the computational results in latest web-browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, et al. Users can pick their own representation style of the atoms which form each topographic feature, and to edit the colors by their own preferences.

== Constriction (graphics media) ==
In [[computer graphics]], constriction is a method of decreasing the [[wikt:resolution|resolution]] of a video. The video quality is decreased to allow non [[Authorization|authorized]] users to see video with lower degree of detail in cases where extra costs or [[licensing]] is required to view the full resolution source.

== Examples ==
Some videos, such as [[films]], require that a person has a [[license]] in order to view or share the content. The owners or creators of the content may not want the public to have access to the full resolution version as that might encourage unauthorised use or distribution of the media. Such behaviour could lead to a monetary loss for the owners. Furthermore, use of the media in other works might lead to he creators being [[Credit (creative arts)|uncredited]]. Therefore, licensing can also act as a form of permissions, blocking unfavoured parties from abusing the content.

To reduce the resolution of [[video]], the frame of image being shown is rendered in memory with a lower fidelity or detail. [[Video compression|Compression]] techniques may also be used to make the content visibly different than the source. Media that is royalty free or public domain usually do not have any contrictions. Instead of lowering resolution, hindrances such as watermarks may also be used to disincentivize people from accessing or using the content freely.

== Implementation ==
Constriction can be executed through rather rudimentary [[software]], although it can be accelerated using a [[video card]]. [[Data compression|Compression]] is an easy way to lower fidelity, and as a result also reduces the [[file size]], which may help in distributing the media to multiple unlicensed parties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16846">[[File:Blooddraw.jpg|thumb|'''Cytometers''' are the instruments which count the blood cells in the common blood test.]]

'''Cytometry''' is the [[measurement]] of the characteristics of [[cell (biology)|cells]]. Variables that can be measured by cytometric methods include [[cell size]], [[cell counting|cell count]], cell morphology (shape and structure), [[cell cycle]] phase, [[DNA]] content, and the existence or absence of specific [[protein]]s on the cell surface or in the [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://isac-net.org/ISAC-Cytometry/What-is-Cytometry.aspx | title=International Society for Advancement of Cytometry | accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cytometry is used to characterize and count [[blood cell]]s in common [[blood test]]s such as the [[complete blood count]]. In a similar fashion, cytometry is also used in cell biology research and in medical diagnostics to characterize cells in a wide range of applications associated with diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[AIDS]].

==Cytometric devices==

===Image cytometers===
Image cytometry is the oldest form of cytometry. Image cytometers operate by statically imaging a large number of
cells using [[optical microscopy]]. Prior to analysis, cells are commonly stained to enhance contrast or 
to detect specific molecules by labeling these with [[fluorochrome]]s. Traditionally,
cells are viewed within a [[hemocytometer]] to aid manual counting.

Since the introduction of the [[digital camera]], in the mid-1990s, the automation level of
image cytometers has steadily increased. This has led to the commercial availability of automated image cytometers, ranging from simple cell counters to sophisticated [[high-content screening]] systems.

===Flow cytometers===
{{main|Flow cytometry}}
Due to the early difficulties of automating microscopy, the [[flow cytometry|flow cytometer]] has since
the mid-1950s been the dominating cytometric device.&lt;ref name="crosland"&gt;{{Cite journal 
| doi = 10.1038/171037b0 
| last1 = Crosland-Taylor | first1 = P. J. 
| title = A device for counting small particles suspended in a fluid through a tube

| volume = 171 
| issue = 4340 
| pages = 37‚Äì38 
| year = 1953 
| pmid = 13025472
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Flow cytometers operate by aligning single cells using flow techniques. The cells are characterized
optically or by the use of an [[electrical impedance]] method called the [[Coulter principle]].
To detect specific molecules when optically characterized, cells are in most cases stained with the same
type of fluorochromes that are used by image cytometers. Flow cytometers generally provide
less data than image cytometers, but have a significantly higher throughput.

===Cell sorters===
{{main|Flow cytometry}}
Cell sorters are flow cytometers capable of sorting cells according to their characteristics.
The sorting is achieved by using technology similar to what is used in [[inkjet printing|inkjet printers]].
The fluid stream is broken up into droplets by a mechanical vibration.
The droplets are then electrically charged according to the characteristics of the cell contained
within the droplet. Depending on their charge, the droplets are finally deflected by an electric field into
different containers.

===Time-lapse cytometers===
[[File:HoloMonitor M4 in Cell Incubator.jpg|thumb| The [http://www.phiab.se/products/holomonitor HoloMonitor M4 '''time-lapse cytometer''']
from [http://www.phiab.se Phase Holographic Imaging] shown inside a cell culture incubator.]]

Conventional flow and image cytometers have the disadvantage of not being able to
observe cells over time.&lt;ref name="shapiro"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Shapiro H. | title=The Evolution of Cytometers | journal=Cytometry Part A| volume=58A | issue=1 | pages=13‚Äì20 | year=2004 | doi=10.1002/cyto.a.10111| pmid=14994215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid decrease in the cost of
digitally storing and processing video information has led to the development of
image cytometers which monitor cultured cells using [[time-lapse microscopy|time-lapse]] video recordings.
After recording, the video is computer processed to track cytometric parameters over time.&lt;ref name="Coutu"&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Coutu | first1 = D. L.

| pmid = 23943879 
| pmc =
 | volume=126
 | issue=Pt 17
 | pages=3805‚Äì15
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The historic information available for each cell allow time-lapse cytometers
to predict the fate of a cell or to characterize its state without using the [[phototoxicity|phototoxic]] 
fluorochromes that are commonly used by flow and image cytometers.&lt;ref name="Pavillon"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key characteristic of time-lapse cytometers is their use of non heat-generating light sources such as [[light-emitting diode]]s.
This allows a time-lapse cytometer to be placed inside a conventional [[cell incubator|cell culture incubator]]
to facilitate continuous observation of cellular processes without heat building up inside the incubator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.phiab.se/products/holomonitor | title=Time-lapse Imaging Cytometers &amp; Cell Incubator Microscopes| publisher=Phase Holographic Imaging AB | accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Hemocytometer with gloved hand.JPG|thumb|left|A '''hemocytometer''']]

===Hemocytometer===
{{main|hemocytometer}}
The early history of cytometry is closely associated with the development of the blood cell counting.
Through the work of [[Karl von Vierordt]], [[Louis-Charles Malassez]], [[Karl B√ºrker]] and others blood cell
concentration could by the late 19th century be accurately measured using a blood cell counting chamber,
the [[hemocytometer]], and an [[optical microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Verso | first=M. L. | title=The Evolution of Blood-Counting Techniques| journal=Med. Hist. | volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=149‚Äì158 | year=1964 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300029392 | pmid=14139094 | pmc=1033366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Verso | first=M. L. | title=Some nineteenth-century pioneers of haematology |
journal=Med. Hist.|volume=15|issue=1|pages=55‚Äì67|year=1971| doi=10.1017/s0025727300016124 | pmid=4929622 | pmc=1034115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1950s the hemocytometer was the standard method to count blood cells.&lt;ref name="Coulter"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.beckmancoulter.com/wsrportal/wsr/research-and-discovery/products-and-services/flow-cytometry/history-of-flow-cytometry/index.htm| title=The History of Flow Cytometry | publisher=Beckman-Coulter Inc. | accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In blood cell counting applications the hemocytometer has now been replaced by [[electronic cell counters]].
However, the hemocytometer is still being used to count cells in cell culture laboratories.
Successively the manual task of counting, using a microscope, is taken over by small automated image cytometers.

===Fluorescence microscope===
{{main|fluorescence microscope}}
In 1904, [[Moritz von Rohr]] and [[August K√∂hler]] at [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss]] in Jena constructed the first ultraviolet microscope.
The intent of the microscope was to obtain higher optical resolution by using illumination with a shorter wavelength than visual light.
However, they experienced difficulties with [[autofluorescence]] when observing biological material. Fortunately,
K√∂hler saw the potential of fluorescence.
A filtering technique for fluorescence excitation light was developed by
[[Heinrich Lehmann]] at Zeiss in 1910, based on work by
[[Robert W. Wood|Robert Wood]]. However, the "Lumineszenzmikroskop" he developed was only second on the market, after the one independently developed by [[Oskar Heimst√§dt]] who worked at C Reichert, Optische Werke AG in Vienna, which today is a part of [[Leica Microsystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Rusk | first=N.| url=http://www.nature.com/milestones/milelight/full/milelight04.html | title=The fluorescence microscope| work=Milestones in Light Microscopy | publisher=Nature Publishing Group | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Heimst√§dt O.|title=Das Fluoreszenzmikroskop | journal=Z. Wiss. Mikrosk.| volume=28 | pages=330‚Äì337 | year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Rost| first=F. W. D.| title=Fluorescent microscopy, volume II | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1995 | pages=183‚Äì187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cytophotometry===
By the early 1930s various firms manufactured ultraviolet fluorescent microscopes. The stage was
set for cytometry to now go beyond the now established hemocytometer. At this time, [[Torbj√∂rn Caspersson]],
working at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, developed a series of progressively more sophisticated
instruments called ''cytophotometers''. These instruments combined a fluorescent microscope with a [[spectrophotometer]]
to quantify cellular nucleic acids and their relation to cell growth and function. Caspersson‚Äôs early
apparatus now seems hopelessly primitive. But, even this primitive apparatus got results, and attracted
the attention of other researchers. Many of the advances in analytical cytology from the 1940s and on-wards
were made by people who made the pilgrimage to Stockholm.&lt;ref name="shapiro" /&gt;

===Pulse cytophotometry===
[[File:Model A COULTER COUNTER from Advertisement.jpg|thumb|'''Model A [[Coulter counter|Coulter Counter]]''' &amp;mdash; The first commercial flow cytometer]]

The first attempts to automate cell counting were made around World War II.
Gucker et al. builds a device to detect bacteria in aerosols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Gucker | first1=F. T. | last2=O‚ÄôKonski | first2= C. T. | last3=Pickard | first3=H.

in aligning cells to be individually counted using microscopy, as Moldavan had proposed in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Joseph and [[Wallace H. Coulter|Wallace Coulter]] circumnavigates these difficulties by inventing the principle
of using electrical impedance to count and size microscopic particles suspended in a fluid.&lt;ref name="Coulter" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent| inventor=Coulter W. H. | title=Means for Counting Particles Suspended in a Fluid. | country=U.S.| number=2656508 | status=patent | fdate=1949-08-27 | gdate=1953-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is today
known as the [[Coulter principle]] and was used in the automated blood cell counter released by [[Beckman Coulter|Coulter Electronics]]
in 1954. The ‚Äú[[Coulter counter]]‚Äù was the first commercial flow cytometer.

During the 1960s Dittrich, G√∂hde and Kamentsky improves the design pioneered by Caspersson 30 years earlier.
Dittrich and G√∂hde‚Äôs ''pulse cytophotometer'' was built around a Zeiss fluorescent microscope and commercialized
as the ICP&amp;nbsp;11 by [http://www.partec.com Partec GmbH] in 1968.
Kamentsky‚Äôs device was commercialized by Bio/Physics Systems Inc. as the Cytograph in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

These devices were able to count cells, like the earlier Coulter counter. But more importantly, they were also capable of measuring cellular characteristics.
However, these early cytophotometers where microscopy-based.&lt;ref name="Kamentsky"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Flow cytometry ===
{{Main|Flow cytometry}}In 1953 Crosland-Taylor published an unsuccessful attempt to count red blood cells using microscopy in which he solved the problem of aligning cells by using [[sheath fluid]] to [[Hydrodynamic focusing|hydrodynamically focus]] the cells.&lt;ref name="crosland" /&gt; In the late 1960s, Van Dilla at Los Alamos National Laboratory built the first non microscopy-based cytophotometer.

In 1978, at the Conference of the American Engineering Foundation in Pensacola, Florida, the name ''pulse cytophotometry''
was changed to ''flow cytometry'', a term which quickly became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

into the modern form of flow cytometry, pioneered by Van Dilla ten years earlier.

{{floating-point}}
In [[computing]], '''decimal64''' is a [[decimal floating-point]] [[computer numbering format]] that occupies 8 bytes (64 bits) in computer memory.
It is intended for applications where it is necessary to emulate decimal rounding exactly, such as financial and tax computations.

Decimal64 supports 16 [[decimal digit]]s of [[significand]] and  an [[exponent]] range of ‚àí383 to +384, i.e. {{gaps|¬±0.000|000|000|000|000|e=-383}} to {{gaps|¬±9.999|999|999|999|999|e=384}}.  (Equivalently, {{gaps|¬±0|000|000|000|000|000|e=-398}} to {{gaps|¬±9|999|999|999|999|999|e=369}}.) In contrast, the corresponding binary format, which is the most commonly used type, has an approximate range of {{gaps|¬±0.000|000|000|000|001|e=-308}} to {{gaps|¬±1.797|693|134|862|315|e=308}}. Because the significand is not normalized, most values with less than 16 [[significant digits]] have multiple possible representations; {{gaps|1√ó10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|&amp;#61;|0.1√ó10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|&amp;#61;|0.01√ó10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, etc.  Zero has 768 possible representations (1536 if you include both [[signed zero]]s).

Decimal64 floating point is a relatively new decimal floating-point format, formally introduced in the [[IEEE 754-2008|2008 version]]&lt;ref name="IEEE-754_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=2008-08-29 |publisher=[[IEEE]] |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4610933 |access-date=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[IEEE 754]] as well as with [[ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011]].&lt;ref name="ISO-60559_2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57469 |date=2011 |access-date=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IEEE 754 allows two alternative representation methods for decimal64 values. The standard does not specify how to signify which representation is used, for instance in a situation where decimal64 values are communicated between systems:

* In the [[#Binary integer significand field|binary representation method]], the 16-digit significand is represented as a binary coded positive integer, based on [[binary integer decimal]] (BID).
* In the [[#Densely packed decimal significand field|decimal representation method]], the 16-digit significand is represented as a decimal coded positive integer, based on [[densely packed decimal]] (DPD) with 5 groups of 3 digits (except the most significant digit encoded specially) are each represented in declets (10-bit sequences). This is pretty efficient, because 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 1024, is only little more than needed to still contain all numbers from 0 to 999.

Both alternatives provide exactly the same range of representable numbers: 16 digits of significand and 3√ó2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 768 possible decimal exponent values. (All the possible decimal exponent values storable in a [[binary64]] number are representable in decimal64, and most bits of the significand of a binary64 are stored keeping roughly the same number of decimal digits in the significand.)

In both cases, the most significant 4 bits of the significand (which actually only have 10 possible values) are combined with the most significant 2 bits of the exponent (3 possible values) to use 30 of the 32 possible values of a 5-bit field.  The remaining combinations encode [[infinity|infinities]] and [[NaN]]s.

|}

In the cases of Infinity and NaN, all other bits of the encoding are ignored.  Thus, it is possible to initialize an array to Infinities or NaNs by filling it with a single byte value.

=== Binary integer significand field ===
This format uses a binary significand from 0 to 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;‚àí1 = {{gaps|9|999|999|999|999|999}} = 2386F26FC0FFFF&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; = {{gaps|1000|1110000110|1111001001|1011111100|0000111111|1111111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The encoding, completely stored on 64 bits, can represent binary significands up to 10√ó2&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;‚àí1 = {{gaps|11|258|999|068|426|239}} = 27FFFFFFFFFFFF&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, but values larger than 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;‚àí1 are illegal (and the standard requires implementations to treat them as 0, if encountered on input).

As described above, the encoding varies depending on whether the most significant 4 bits of the significand are in the range 0 to 7 (0000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 0111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or higher (1000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 1001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

If the 2 bits after the sign bit are "00", "01", or "10", then the  exponent field consists of the 10 bits following the sign bit, and the significand is the remaining 53 bits, with an implicit leading 0 bit:

 s 00eeeeeeee   (0)ttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 01eeeeeeee   (0)ttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 10eeeeeeee   (0)ttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 
This includes [[subnormal numbers]] where the leading significand digit is 0.

If the 2 bits after the sign bit are "11", then the 10-bit exponent field is shifted 2 bits to the right (after both the sign bit and the "11" bits thereafter), and the represented significand is in the remaining 51 bits. In this case there is an implicit (that is, not stored) leading 3-bit sequence "100" for the most bits of the true significand (in the remaining lower bits ''ttt...ttt'' of the significand, not all possible values are used).

 s 1100eeeeeeee (100)t tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 1101eeeeeeee (100)t tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 1110eeeeeeee (100)t tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt

The 2-bit sequence "11" after the sign bit indicates that there is an ''implicit'' 3-bit prefix "100" to the significand. Compare having an implicit 1-bit prefix "1" in the significand of normal values for the binary formats. Note also that the 2-bit sequences "00", "01", or "10" after the sign bit are part of the exponent field.

Note that the leading bits of the significand field do ''not'' encode the most significant decimal digit; they are simply part of a larger pure-binary number.  For example, a significand of {{gaps|8|000|000|000|000|000}} is encoded as binary {{gaps|0111|0001101011|1111010100|1001100011|0100000000|0000000000}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with the leading 4 bits encoding 7; the first significand which requires a 54th bit is 2&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt; = {{gaps|9|007|199|254|740|992}}. The highest valid significant is {{gaps|9|999|999|999|999|999}} whose binary encoding is
{{gaps|(100)0|1110000110|1111001001|1011111100|0000111111|1111111111}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (with the 3 most significant bits (100) not stored but implicit as shown above; and the next bit is always zero in valid encodings).

In the above cases, the value represented is

: (‚àí1)&lt;sup&gt;sign&lt;/sup&gt; √ó 10&lt;sup&gt;exponent‚àí398&lt;/sup&gt; √ó significand &lt;!-- Remember, significand is defined as an integer: 0 &lt;= significand &lt; 10^16 --&gt;

If the four bits after the sign bit are "1111" then the value is an infinity or a NaN, as described above:

 s 11110 xx...x    ¬±infinity
 s 11111 0x...x    a quiet NaN
 s 11111 1x...x    a signalling NaN

=== Densely packed decimal significand field ===
In this version, the significand is stored as a series of decimal digits.  The leading digit is between 0 and 9 (3 or 4 binary bits), and the rest of the significand uses the [[densely packed decimal]] (DPD) encoding.

Unlike the binary integer significand version, where the exponent changed position and came before the significand, this encoding, combines the leading 2 bits of the exponent and the leading digit (3 or 4 bits) of the significand into the five bits that follow the sign bit.

This eight bits after that are the exponent continuation field, providing the less-significant bits of the exponent.

The last 50 bits are the significand continuation field, consisting of five 10-bit ''[[declet (computing)|declet]]s''.&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Muller |author-first1=Jean-Michel |author-last2=Brisebarre |author-first2=Nicolas |author-last3=de Dinechin |author-first3=Florent |author-last4=Jeannerod |author-first4=Claude-Pierre |author-last5=Lef√®vre |author-first5=Vincent |author-last6=Melquiond |author-first6=Guillaume |author-last7=Revol |author-first7=Nathalie |author-last8=Stehl√© |author-first8=Damien |author-last9=Torres |author-first9=Serge |title=Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic |year=2010 |publisher=[[Birkh√§user]] |edition=1 |isbn=978-0-8176-4704-9&lt;!-- print --&gt; |doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4705-6 |lccn=2009939668&lt;!-- |isbn=978-0-8176-4705-6 (online), ISBN 0-8176-4704-X (print) --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each declet encodes three decimal digits&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"/&gt; using the DPD encoding.

If the first two bits after the sign bit are "00", "01", or "10", then those are the leading bits of the exponent, and the three bits "TTT" after that are interpreted as the leading decimal digit (0 to 7):

 s 00 TTT (00)eeeeeeee (0TTT)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 01 TTT (01)eeeeeeee (0TTT)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 10 TTT (10)eeeeeeee (0TTT)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt]

If the first two bits after the sign bit are "11", then the second 2-bits are the leading bits of the exponent, and the next bit "T" is prefixed with implicit bits "100" to form the leading decimal digit (8 or 9):

 s 1100 T (00)eeeeeeee (100T)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 1101 T (01)eeeeeeee (100T)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 1110 T (10)eeeeeeee (100T)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt]

The remaining two combinations (11 110 and 11 111) of the 5-bit field after the sign bit are used to represent ¬±infinity and NaNs, respectively.

The DPD/3BCD transcoding for the declets is given by the following table. b9...b0 are the bits of the DPD, and d2...d0 are the three BCD digits.

{{Densely packed decimal}}

The 8 decimal values whose digits are all 8s or 9s have four codings each.
The bits marked x in the table above are ignored on input, but will always be 0 in computed results.
(The 8√ó3 = 24 non-standard encodings fill in the gap between 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=1000 and 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;=1024.)

In the above cases, with the ''true significand'' as the sequence of decimal digits decoded, the value represented is

:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^\text{signbit}\times 10^{\text{exponentbits}_2-398_{10}}\times \text{truesignificand}_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Demography''' (from prefix ''demo-'' from [[Ancient Greek]] Œ¥·øÜŒºŒøœÇ ''dƒìmos'' meaning "the people", and ''-graphy'' from Œ≥œÅŒ¨œÜœâ ''graph≈ç'', implies "writing, description or measurement"&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demography for etymology (origins) of ''demography''].&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[statistics|statistical study]] of [[population|populations]], especially [[human|human beings]]. As a very general science, it can analyze any kind of dynamic living population, i.e., one that changes over time or space (see [[population dynamics]]).  Demography encompasses the study of the size, structure, and distribution of these populations, and spatial or temporal changes in them in response to [[birth]], [[Migration (human)|migration]], [[aging]], and [[death]]. Based on the demographic research of the earth, earth's population up to the year 2050 and 2100 can be estimated by demographers. Demographics are quantifiable characteristics of a given population.

[[Demographic analysis]] can cover whole societies or groups defined by criteria such as [[education]], [[nationality]], [[religion]], and [[ethnicity]]. Educational institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Science of Population |url=http://demographicpartitions.org/science-population-determines-population-change/ |website=demographicpartitions.org |accessdate=4 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814023915/http://demographicpartitions.org/science-population-determines-population-change/ |archivedate=14 August 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually treat demography as a field of [[sociology]], though there are a number of independent demography departments.&lt;ref name="ub"&gt;{{Cite web | title=UC Berkeley Demography department website | url=http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formal demography''' limits its object of study to the measurement of population processes, while the broader field of '''social demography''' or population studies also analyses the relationships between economic, social, cultural, and biological processes influencing a population.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hinde ''Demographic Methods'' Ch. 1 {{ISBN|0-340-71892-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Demographic thoughts traced back to antiquity, and were present in many civilisations and cultures, like [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="Srivastava2006"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oNcflpmW3BUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=studies+in+demography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y1QFr3LGxP&amp;sig=xJkW1mxVL6XS-Gij0tOpOsFZA9E&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=qdjRS8DjMsGC8gbj4Ii_Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false S.C.Srivastava,''Studies in Demography'', p.39-41]&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Greece, this can be found in the writings of [[Herodotus]], [[Thucidides]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Epicurus]], [[Protagoras]], [[Polus]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Srivastava2006" /&gt; In Rome, writers and philosophers like [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Pliny the elder]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Epictetus]], [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], and [[Columella]] also expressed important ideas on this ground.&lt;ref name="Srivastava2006"/&gt;

In the [[Middle ages]], Christian thinkers devoted much time in refuting the Classical ideas on demography.  Important contributors to the field were [[William of Conches]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000"&gt;Peter Biller,''The measure of multitude: Population in medieval thought''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LnqlgqeYhwYC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;lpg=PA312&amp;dq=Nicole+Oresme+on+demographics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1RB9HPQrvY&amp;sig=RtvI_JuQ4SGR0QYfa7ptB5eDW1w&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=kdLRS8SJBcO78gbWg8jNDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bartholomew of Lucca]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000" /&gt; [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris|William of Auvergne]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000" /&gt; [[William of Pagula]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000" /&gt; and [[Ibn Khaldun]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, &amp; Daria Khaltourina (2006). ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''. Moscow: URSS,  {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest demographic studies in the modern period was ''Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality'' (1662) by [[John Graunt]], which contains a primitive form of [[actuarial table|life table]]. Among the study's findings were that one third of the children in London died before their sixteenth birthday. Mathematicians, such as [[Edmond Halley]], developed the life table as the basis for life insurance mathematics. [[Richard Price]] was credited with the first textbook on life contingencies published in 1771,&lt;ref&gt;‚ÄúOur Yesterdays: the History of the Actuarial Profession in North America, 1809-1979,‚Äù by E.J. (Jack) Moorhead, FSA, ( 1/23/10 ‚Äì 2/21/04), published by the Society of Actuaries as part of the profession‚Äôs centennial celebration in 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; followed later by [[Augustus de Morgan]], ‚ÄòOn the Application of Probabilities to Life Contingencies‚Äô (1838).&lt;ref&gt;The History of Insurance, Vol 3, Edited by David Jenkins and Takau Yoneyama (1 85196 527 0): 8 Volume Set: ( 2000) Availability: Japan: Kinokuniya).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1755, [[Benjamin Franklin]] published his essay ''[[Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.]]'', projecting [[exponential growth]] in British colonies.&lt;ref name=valtier&gt;{{cite journal|title= "An Extravagant Assumption": The Demographic Numbers behind Benjamin Franklin's Twenty-Five-Year Doubling Period|last=von Valtier|first=William F.|journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]|volume=155|number=2|date=June 2011|pages=158‚Äì188|url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/5VonValtier1550205.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work influenced [[Thomas Robert Malthus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |date=April 25, 1941 |title=Natural Selection before the 'Origin of Species' |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]] |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]] |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71‚Äì123 |jstor=984852 |issn=0003-049X}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, writing at the end of the 18th century, feared that, if unchecked, population growth would tend to outstrip growth in food production, leading to ever-increasing famine and poverty (see [[Malthusian catastrophe]]). Malthus is seen as the intellectual father of ideas of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the limits to growth. Later, more sophisticated and realistic models were presented by [[Benjamin Gompertz]] and [[Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst|Verhulst]].

The period 1860-1910 can be characterised as a period of transition wherein demography emerged from statistics as a separate field of interest. This period included a panoply of international ‚Äògreat demographers‚Äô like [[Adolphe Qu√©telet]] (1796‚Äì1874), [[William Farr]] (1807‚Äì1883), [[Louis-Adolphe Bertillon]] (1821‚Äì1883) and his son [[Jacques Bertillon|Jacques]] (1851‚Äì1922), [[Joseph K√∂r√∂si]] (1844‚Äì1906), [[Anders Nicolas Kaier]] (1838‚Äì1919), [[Richard B√∂ckh]] (1824‚Äì1907), [[√âmile Durkheim]] (1858-1917), [[Wilhelm Lexis]] (1837‚Äì1914), and [[Luigi Bodio]] (1840‚Äì1920) contributed to the development of demography and to the toolkit of methods and techniques of demographic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;de Gans, Henk and Frans van Poppel (2000) Contributions from the margins.

==Methods==
There are two types of data collection‚Äîdirect and indirect‚Äîwith several different methods of each type.

=== Direct methods ===
Direct data comes from vital statistics registries that track all births and deaths as well as certain changes in legal status such as marriage, divorce, and migration (registration of place of residence). In developed countries with good registration systems (such as the United States and much of Europe), registry statistics are the best method for estimating the number of births and deaths.

A [[census]] is the other common direct method of collecting demographic data. A census is usually conducted by a national government and attempts to enumerate every person in a country. In contrast to vital statistics data, which are typically collected continuously and summarized on an annual basis, censuses typically occur only every 10 years or so, and thus are not usually the best source of data on births and deaths. Analyses are conducted after a census to estimate how much over or undercounting took place. These compare the [[sex ratio]]s from the census data to those estimated from natural values and mortality data.

Censuses do more than just count people. They  typically collect information about families or households in addition to individual characteristics such as age, sex, marital  status, literacy/education, employment status, and occupation, and geographical location. They may also collect data on migration (or place of birth or of previous residence), language, religion, nationality (or ethnicity or race), and citizenship.  In countries in which the vital registration system may be incomplete, the censuses are also used as a direct source of information about fertility and mortality; for example the censuses of the [[People's Republic of China]] gather information on births and deaths that occurred in the 18 months immediately preceding the census.

[[File:World population growth - time between each billion-person growth.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Rate of human population growth showing projections for later this century]]

=== Indirect methods ===
Indirect methods of collecting data are required in countries and periods where full data are not available, such as is the case in much of the developing world, and most of [[historical demography]]. One of these techniques in contemporary demography is the sister method, where survey researchers ask women how many of their sisters have died or had children and at what age. With these surveys, researchers can then indirectly estimate birth or death rates for the entire population. Other indirect methods in contemporary demography include asking people about siblings, parents, and children. Other indirect methods are necessary in historical demography.

There are a variety of demographic methods for modelling population processes. They include [[models of mortality]] (including the [[life table]], [[Gompertz curve|Gompertz models]], [[Proportional hazards models|hazards models]], [[Proportional hazards models|Cox proportional hazards models]], [[Decrement table|multiple decrement life tables]], [[Brass relational logits]]), [[fertility]] ([[Hernes model]], [[Ansley J. Coale|Coale]]-Trussell models, [[parity progression ratios]]), marriage (Singulate Mean at Marriage, [[Page model]]), disability ([[Sullivan's method]], [[multistate life tables]]), [[population projections]] ([[Lee‚ÄìCarter model|Lee-Carter model]], the [[Leslie matrix|Leslie Matrix]]), and [[population momentum]] ([[Nathan Keyfitz|Keyfitz]]).

The United Kingdom has a series of four national birth cohort studies, the first three spaced apart by 12 years: the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development, the 1958 [[National Child Development Study]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Power C and Elliott J |title=Cohort profile: 1958 British Cohort Study |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=34‚Äì41 |year=2006 |pmid=16155052 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyi183}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[1970 British Cohort Study]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elliott J and Shepherd P|title=Cohort profile: 1970 British Birth Cohort (BCS70)|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=836‚Äì43|year=2006 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl174 |pmid=16931528}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Millennium Cohort Study]], begun much more recently in 2000. These have followed the lives of samples of people (typically beginning with around 17,000 in each study) for many years, and are still continuing. As the samples have been drawn in a nationally representative way, inferences can be drawn from these studies about the differences between four distinct generations of British people in terms of their health, education, attitudes, childbearing and employment patterns.&lt;ref&gt;The last three are run by the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk Centre for Longitudinal Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common rates and ratios==

* The '''crude [[birth rate]]''', the annual number of live births per 1,000 people.
* The '''general [[fertility rate]]''', the annual number of live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age (often taken to be from 15 to 49 years old, but sometimes from 15 to 44).
* The '''age-specific fertility''' rates, the annual number of live births per 1,000 women in particular age groups (usually age 15-19, 20-24 etc.)
* The '''crude [[death rate]]''', the annual number of deaths per 1,000 people.
* The '''[[infant mortality rate]]''', the annual number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1,000 live births.
* The '''expectation of life''' (or [[life expectancy]]), the number of years that an individual at a given age could expect to live at present mortality levels.
* The '''[[total fertility rate]]''', the number of live births per woman completing her reproductive life, if her childbearing at each age reflected current age-specific fertility rates.
* The '''replacement level fertility''', the average number of children women must have in order to replace the population for the next generation. For example, the replacement level fertility in the US is 2.11.&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"&gt;Introduction to environmental engineering and science by Masters and Ela, 2008, Pearson Education, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''[[gross reproduction rate]]''', the number of daughters who would be born to a woman completing her reproductive life at current age-specific fertility rates.
* The '''net reproduction ratio''' is the expected number of daughters, per newborn prospective mother, who may or may not survive to and through the ages of childbearing.
* A '''stable population''', one that has had constant crude birth and death rates for such a long period of time that the percentage of people in every age class remains constant, or equivalently, the population pyramid has an unchanging structure.&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"/&gt;
* A '''stationary population''', one that is both stable and unchanging in size (the difference between crude birth rate and crude death rate is zero).&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"/&gt;

A stable population does not necessarily remain fixed in size. It can be expanding or shrinking.&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"/&gt;

Note that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression. For example, the number of deaths per 1,000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite standards of health being better in developed countries. This is because developed countries have proportionally more older people, who are more likely to die in a given year, so that the overall mortality rate can be higher even if the mortality rate at any given age is lower. A more complete picture of mortality is given by a [[life table]], which summarizes mortality separately at each age. A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy.

==Basic equation==
Suppose that a country (or other entity) contains ''Population&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' persons at time ''t''.
What is the size of the population at time ''t'' + 1 ?

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Population}_{t+1} = \text{Population}_t + \text{Natural Increase}_t + \text{Net Migration}_t&lt;/math&gt;

Natural increase from time ''t'' to ''t'' + 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Natural Increase}_t = \text{Births}_t - \text{Deaths}_t&lt;/math&gt;

Net migration from time ''t'' to ''t'' + 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Net Migration}_t = \text{Immigration}_t - \text{Emigration}_t&lt;/math&gt;

This basic equation can also be applied to subpopulations.  For example, the population size of ethnic groups or nationalities within a given society or country is subject to the same sources of change.  When dealing with ethnic groups, however, "net migration" might have to be subdivided into physical migration and ethnic reidentification ([[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]).  Individuals who change their ethnic self-labels or whose ethnic classification in government statistics changes over time may be thought of as migrating or moving from one population subcategory to another.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, "Estimating Russification of Ethnic Identity Among Non-Russians in the USSR," ''Demography'', Vol. 20, No. 4 (Nov., 1983): 461-489.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, while the basic demographic equation holds true by definition, in practice the recording and counting of events (births, deaths, immigration, emigration) and the enumeration of the total population size are subject to error. So allowance needs to be made for error in the underlying statistics when any accounting of population size or change is made.

The figure in this section shows the latest (2004) UN projections of world population out to the year 2150 (red = high, orange = medium, green = low). The UN "medium" projection shows world population reaching an approximate equilibrium at 9 billion by 2075. Working independently, demographers at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] in Austria expect world population to peak at 9 billion by 2070.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ace1.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/reading/worldbirthrate.pdf |title=Doubling of world population unlikely |first=Wolfgang |last=Lutz |author2=Sanderson, Warren |author3=Scherbov, Sergei |journal=Nature |volume=387 |pages=803‚Äì805 |date=1997-06-19 |accessdate=2008-11-13 |format=PDF |doi=10.1038/42935 |pmid=9194559 |issue=6635 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216230409/http://ace1.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/reading/worldbirthrate.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 21st century, the average age of the population is likely to continue to rise.

===Science of population===
Populations can change through three processes: fertility, mortality, and migration.  Fertility involves the number of children that women have and is to be contrasted with fecundity (a woman's childbearing potential).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Bongaarts]]. The Fertility-Inhibiting Effects of the Intermediate Fertility Variables. Studies in Family Planning, Vol. 13, No. 6/7. (Jun. - Jul., 1982), pp. 179-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality is the study of the causes, consequences, and measurement of processes affecting death to members of the population.  Demographers most commonly study mortality using the [[Life Table]], a statistical device that provides information about the mortality conditions (most notably the life expectancy) in the population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/lftbls/lftbls.htm N C H S - Life Tables&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration refers to the movement of persons from a locality of origin to a destination place across some predefined, political boundary. Migration researchers do not designate movements 'migrations' unless they are somewhat permanent.  Thus demographers do not consider tourists and travellers to be migrating. While demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of residence, indirect sources of data including tax forms and labour force surveys are also important.&lt;ref&gt;Donald T. Rowland ''Demographic Methods and Concepts'' Ch. 11 {{ISBN|0-19-875263-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demography is today widely taught in many universities across the world, attracting students with initial training in social sciences, statistics or health studies. Being at the crossroads of several disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[epidemiology]], [[geography]], [[anthropology]] and [[history]], demography offers tools to approach a large range of population issues by combining a more technical quantitative approach that represents the core of the discipline with many other methods borrowed from social or other sciences. Demographic research is conducted in universities, in research institutes as well as in statistical departments and in several international agencies. Population institutions are part of the [[Cicred]] (International Committee for Coordination of Demographic Research) network while most individual scientists engaged in demographic research are members of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iussp.org International Union for the Scientific Study of Population]&lt;/ref&gt; or a national association such as the [[Population Association of America]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.populationassociation.org Population Association of America]&lt;/ref&gt; or affiliates of the Federation of Canadian Demographers in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canpopsoc.org Canadian Population Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626005822/http://www.canpopsoc.org/ |date=26 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Naive realism.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Direct realism argues we perceive the world directly]]

The question of '''direct''' or '''na√Øve realism''', as opposed to '''indirect''' or '''representational realism''', arises in the [[philosophy of perception]] and [[philosophy of mind|of mind]] out of the debate over the nature of [[Consciousness|conscious]] [[Qualia|experience]];&lt;ref name=lehar&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/consc1/consc1.html The Function of Conscious Experience: An Analogical Paradigm of Perception and Behavior], ''Consciousness and Cognition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ce&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html Na√Øve Realism in Contemporary Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811172229/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html |date=2012-08-11 }}, ''The Function of Conscious Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by [[neural]] processes in our [[Human brain|brain]]. [[Na√Øve realism]] is known as ''direct'' realism when developed to counter ''indirect'' or representative realism, also known as epistemological dualism,&lt;ref&gt;Lehar, Steve. [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html Representationalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905185905/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] position that our conscious experience is not of the real world itself but of an [[Mental representation|internal representation]], a miniature [[Virtual reality|virtual-reality]] replica of the world.

Indirect realism is broadly equivalent to the accepted view of [[perception]] in natural science that states that we do not and cannot perceive the external world as it really is but know only our ideas and interpretations of the way the world is.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] (or audition) is the ability to perceive (create ideas of)sound by detecting vibrations. The sound waves of language cannot perceive directly. They are only heard, interpreted and understood because the physical waves were transformed into ideas (Mental representation of sound wages) by our brains.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Representationalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is one of the key assumptions of [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] in [[psychology]]. The representational realist would deny that "first-hand knowledge" is a coherent concept, since knowledge is always via some means. Our ideas of the world are interpretations of sensory input derived from an external world that is real (unlike the standpoint of [[idealism]], which holds that only ideas are real, but mind-independent things are not).

The main alternative to representationalism is '''anti-representationalism''',&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; the view according to which perception is not a process of constructing internal representations.

==History==
[[Aristotle]] was the first to provide a description of direct realism. In ''[[On the Soul]]'' he describes how a see-er is informed of the [[substance theory|object itself]] by way of the [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic form]] carried over the intervening material continuum with which the eye is impressed.&lt;ref name="Bernecker2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=S. |last=Bernecker |year=2008 |title=The Metaphysics of Memory |series=Philosophical Studies Series |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781402082191 |lccn=2008921236 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNk4jvxjVhUC&amp;pg=PA62 |page=62 |quote=The distinction between direct and indirect realism about perception has an interesting history. There was a time when perception was understood to be of things themselves, not of our ideas of things. This is what we find in Aristotle and Aquinas, who maintain that the mind or understanding grasps the form of the material object without the matter. What we perceive directly, on this view, are material objects. This changed in the seventeenth century with Descartes and Locke. who can be read as saying that the primary objects of perception are not things external to the mind but sense-data. Sense-data are the messengers that stand between us and physical objects such as tables and chairs. While indirect realism was the standard view of early modern philosophers, nowadays direct realism is, once again, in fashion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medieval philosophy]], [[direct realism]] was defended by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Bernecker2008"/&gt;

Indirect realism was popular with several [[early modern philosophy|early modern philosophers]], including [[Ren√© Descartes]],&lt;ref name=Yolton&gt;John W. Yolton, ''Realism and Appearances: An Essay in Ontology'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]],&lt;ref name=Yolton/&gt; [[G. W. Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Dickerson, ''Kant on Representation and Objectivity'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Berkeley]],&lt;ref name=SEP-PP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/ The Problem of Perception (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]: "Paraphrasing David Hume (1739...; see also Locke 1690, Berkeley 1710, Russell 1912): nothing is ever directly present to the mind in perception except perceptual appearances."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name=SEP-PP/&gt;

Locke categorized qualities as follows:&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Smith, "On Primary and Secondary Qualities", ''Philosophical Review'' (1990), 221‚Äì54.&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Primary qualities are qualities which are "explanatorily basic" ‚Äì which is to say, they can be referred to as the explanation for other qualities or phenomena without requiring explanation themselves ‚Äì and they are distinct in that our sensory experience of them resembles them in reality.  (For example, one perceives an object as spherical precisely because of the way the atoms of the sphere are arranged.)  Primary qualities cannot be removed by either thought or physical action, and include mass, movement, and, controversially, solidity (although later proponents of the distinction between primary and secondary qualities usually discount solidity).
* Secondary qualities are qualities which one's experience does not directly resemble; for example, when one sees an object as red, the sensation of seeing redness is not produced by some quality of redness in the object, but by the arrangement of atoms on the surface of the object which reflects and absorbs light in a particular way.  Secondary qualities include colour, smell, and taste.

[[Thomas Reid]], a notable member of the [[Scottish common sense realism]] was proponent of direct realism.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Rysiew, ''New Essays on Thomas Reid'', Routledge, 2017, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct realist views have been attributed to [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Della Rocca (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Spinoza'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[empirical realism]] has also been interpreted as a form of direct realism.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Schulting, Jacco Verburgt (eds.), ''Kant's Idealism: New Interpretations of a Controversial Doctrine'', Springer 2010, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Late modern philosophy|Late modern philosophers]], [[J. G. Fichte]] and [[G. W. F. Hegel]] followed Kant in adopting empirical realism.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Breazeale and [[Tom Rockmore]] (eds.), ''Fichte, German Idealism, and Early Romanticism'', Rodopi, 2010, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Rockmore]], ''Before and After Hegel: A Historical Introduction to Hegel's Thought'', Hackett Publishing, 2003, p. xviii: "Hegel follows Kant ... in limiting claims to know to the empirically real. In short, he adopts a view very similar to Kant's empirical realism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottlob Frege]] (in his paper "[[On Sense and Reference|√úber Sinn und Bedeutung]]") also subscribed to indirect realism.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Lebens, ''Bertrand Russell and the Nature of Propositions: A History and Defence of the Multiple Relation Theory of Judgement'', Routledge, 2017, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], indirect realism has been defended by [[Edmund Husserl]]&lt;ref&gt;Robin D. Rollinger, ''Husserl's Position in the School of Brentano'', ''Phaenomenologica'' 150, Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1999, p. 224 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref name=SEP-PP/&gt; Direct realism has been defended by [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary. Sep. 1994. "The Dewey Lectures 1994: Sense, Nonsense, and the Senses: An Inquiry into the Powers of the Human Mind." ''The Journal of Philosophy'' '''91'''(9):445‚Äì518.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McDowell]],&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, &lt;!--November--&gt;1994, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275‚Äì281.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galen Strawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Galen Strawson, [https://vimeo.com/91346935 "Real Direct Realism"], a lecture recorded 2014 at Marc Sanders Foundation, Vimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John R. Searle]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, ''Seeing Things as They Are: A Theory of Perception'', Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, epistemological dualism has come under sustained attack by other contemporary philosophers, such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (the [[private language argument]]) and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] in his seminal essay "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind". Indirect realism is argued to be problematical because of [[Ryle's regress]] and the [[homunculus argument]]. However, recently reliance on the private language argument and the Homunculus Objection has itself come under attack. It can be argued that those who argue for "inner presence", to use Antti Revonsuo's term,&lt;ref&gt;Revonsuo, Antti (2006) ''Inner Presence:  Consciousness as a Biological Phenomenon,'' Cambridge MA:  MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; are not proposing  a private "referent", with the application of language to it being "private" and thus unshareable, but a ''private'' use of ''public'' language.  There is no doubt that each of us has a private understanding of public language, a notion that has been experimentally supported;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ragnar Rommetveit|Rommetveit, Ragnar]] (1974) ''On Message Structure:  A Framework for the Study of Language and Communication,'' London:  John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; George Steiner refers to our personal use of language as an "idiolect", one particular to ourselves in its detail.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, George (1998), ''After Babel:  Aspects of Language and Translation,'' London &amp; New York:  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The question has to be put how a collective use of language can go on when, not only do we have differing understandings of the words we use, but our sensory registrations differ.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, C. L. (1988) ''Color for Philosophers,'' Indianapolis IN:  Hackett Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against direct realism==

===The argument from illusion===
[[Image:Caf√© wall.svg|250px|thumb|right|Illusion creates a problem for na√Øve realists as it suggests our senses are fallible, perceiving things that aren't there. In this illusion, the lines are horizontal, despite how they appear.]]
This argument was "first offered in a more or less fully explicit form in [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] ([[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous|1713]])."&lt;ref name=sep&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/ Epistemological Problems of Perception], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as the problem of conflicting appearances (e.g. [[Myles Burnyeat]]'s article ''Conflicting Appearances''). It has been argued that "informed commonsense" indicates that perceptions often depend on organs of perception.&lt;ref name="uor" /&gt; For example, humans would receive visual information very differently if they, like flies, had compound eyes, and may not even be able to imagine how things would appear with entirely different sense organs such as [[infra-red]] detectors or [[acoustic location|echo-location]] devices. Furthermore, perception systems can misrepresent objects even when in full working order, as shown, for example, by [[optical illusion]]s like the [[M√ºller-Lyer illusion]]. More dramatically, sometimes people perceive things which are not there at all, which can be termed instances of "hallucination" or "perceptual delusion".&lt;ref name=uor&gt;[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/ld/Philos/jmp/Theory%20of%20Knowledge/NaiveRealism.htm Na√Øve Realism], [[University of Reading]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Illusions are present in nature. [[Rainbows]] are an example of a perceptual delusion. "For, unlike an architectural arch, a rainbow recedes as we approach it, never to be reached."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gregory|Gregory, Richard.]] (2003). [http://www.perceptionweb.com/perception/perc0303/editorial.pdf Delusions.] ''Perception.'' '''32''', pp. 257-261.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[argument from illusion]] allegedly shows the need to posit sense-data as the immediate objects of perception. In cases of illusion or [[hallucination]], the object has qualities that no public physical object in that situation has and so must be distinct from any such object.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Na√Øve realism may accommodate these facts as they stand by virtue of its very vagueness (or "open-texture"): it is not specific or detailed enough to be refuted by such cases.&lt;ref name=uor/&gt; A more developed direct realist might respond by showing that various cases of misperception, failed perception, and perceptual relativity do not make it necessary to suppose that sense-data exist. When a stick submerged in water looks bent a direct realist is not compelled to say the stick actually is bent but can say that the stick can have more than one appearance: a straight stick can look bent when light reflected from the stick arrives at one's eye in a crooked pattern, but this appearance is not necessarily a sense-datum in the mind. Similar things can be said about the coin which appears circular from one vantage point and oval-shaped from another. Pressing on your eyeball with a finger creates double vision but assuming the existence of two sense-data is unnecessary: the direct realist can say that they have two eyes, each giving them a different view of the world. Usually the eyes are focused in the same direction; but sometimes they are not.

However, this response is presumably based on previously observed data. If one were to be able to observe nothing other than the stick in the water, with no previous information, it would appear that the stick was bent. Visual depth in particular is a set of inferences, not an actual experience of the space between things in a radial direction outward from the observation point.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Alex. (2003). [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~lka/conr.htm The Empirical Description of Conscious Experience], ''The Science and Philosophy of Consciousness.''&lt;/ref&gt; If all [[empirical evidence]] is based upon observation then the entire developed memory and knowledge of every perception and of each sense may be as skewed as the bent stick. Since objects with different qualities are experienced from each of the different perspectives there is no apparent experiential basis for regarding one out of any such set of related perceptual experiences as the one in which the relevant physical object is itself immediately experienced. The most reasonable conclusion is that the experienced object is always distinct from the physical object or at least that there is no way to identify which, if any, of the immediately experienced objects is the physical object itself. Epistemologically it is as though physical objects were never given, whether or not that is in fact the case.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Another potential counter-example involves vivid hallucinations: phantom elephants, for instance, might be interpreted as sense-data. A direct realist response would differentiate hallucination from genuine perception: no perception of elephants is going on, only the different and related mental process of hallucination. However, if there are visual images when we hallucinate it seems reasonable that there are visual images when we see. Similarly if dreaming involves visual and auditory images in our minds it seems reasonable to think there are visual and auditory images, or sense-data, when we are awake and perceiving things. This argument has been challenged in a number of different ways. First it has been questioned whether there must be some object present that actually has the experienced qualities, which would then seemingly have to be something like a sense-datum. Why couldn't it be that the perceiver is simply in a state of seeming to experience such an object without any object actually being present? Second, in cases of illusion and perceptual relativity there is an object present which is simply misperceived, usually in readily explainable ways, and no need to suppose that an additional object is also involved. Third, the last part of the perceptual relativity version of the argument has been challenged by questioning whether there is really no experiential difference between veridical and non-veridical perception; and by arguing that even if sense-data are experienced in non-veridical cases and even if the difference between veridical and non-veridical cases is, as claimed, experientially indiscernible, there is still no reason to think that sense-data are the immediate objects of experience in veridical cases. Fourth, do sense-data exist through time or are they momentary? Can they exist when not being perceived? Are they public or private? Can they be themselves misperceived? Do they exist in minds or are they extra-mental, even if not physical? On the basis of the intractability of these questions, it has been argued that the conclusion of the argument from illusion is unacceptable or even unintelligible, even in the absence of a clear diagnosis of exactly where and how it goes wrong.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Direct realists can potentially deny the existence of any such thing as a mental image but this is difficult to maintain, since we seem able to visually imagine all sorts of things with ease. Even if perception does not involve images other mental processes like imagination certainly seem to. One view, similar to Reid's, is that we do have images of various sorts in our minds when we perceive, dream, hallucinate and imagine but when we actually perceive things, our sensations cannot be considered objects of perception or attention. The only objects of perception are external objects. Even if perception is accompanied by images, or sensations, it is wrong to say we perceive sensations. Direct realism defines perception as perception of external objects where an "external object" is allowed to be a photon in the eye but not an impulse in a nerve leading from the eye. Recent work in neuroscience suggests a shared ontology for perception, imagination and dreaming, with similar areas of brain being used for all of these.

==Problems with the indirect theory&lt;!--Linked from 'Social constructionism'--&gt;==

A problem with representationalism is that if simple data flow and [[information processing]] is assumed then something in the brain must be interpreting incoming data as a "percept". This something is often described as a [[homunculus]], although the term homunculus is also used to imply an entity that creates a continual [[Regress argument|regress]], and this need not be implied. This suggests that some phenomenon other than simple data flow and [[information processing]] is involved in perception. This is more of an issue now than it was for [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers prior to Newton, such as Descartes, for whom physical processes were poorly defined. Descartes held that there is a "homunculus" in the form of the soul, belonging to a form of natural substance known as ''[[Mental substance|res cogitans]]'' that obeyed different laws from those obeyed by solid matter (''[[res extensa]]''). Although Descartes' duality of natural substances may have echoes in modern physics (Bose and Fermi statistics) no agreed account of 'interpretation' has been formulated. Thus representationalism remains an incomplete description of perception. Aristotle realized this and simply proposed that ideas themselves (representations) must be aware‚Äîin other words that there is no further transfer of sense impressions beyond ideas.
[[Image:Rep-perception.jpg|right|thumb|400px|The representational theory of perception]]

A potential difficulty with representational realism is that, if we only have knowledge of representations of the world, how can we know that they resemble in any significant way the objects to which they are supposed to correspond? Any creature with a representation in its brain would need to interact with the objects that are represented to identify them with the representation. This difficulty would seem reasonably to be covered by the learning by exploration of the world that goes on throughout life. However, there may still be a concern that if the external world is only to be [[inference|inferred]], its 'true likeness' might be quite different from our idea of it. The representational realist would answer to this that "true likeness" is an intuitive concept that falls in the face of logic, since a likeness must always depend on the way in which something is considered.

A semantic difficulty may arise when considering [[reference]] in representationalism. If a person says "I see the Eiffel Tower" at a time when they are indeed looking at the Eiffel Tower, to what does the term "Eiffel Tower" refer? The direct realist might say that in the representational account people do not really see the tower but rather 'see' the representation. However, this is a distortion of the meaning of the word see which the representationalist does not imply. For the representationalist the statement refers to the Eiffel Tower, which implicitly is experienced in the form of a representation. The representationalist does not imply that when a person refers to the Eiffel Tower, they are referring to their [[Empirical evidence|sense experience]], and when another person refers to the Tower, they are referring to their sense experience.

Furthermore, representative realism claims that we perceive our perceptual intermediaries-we can attend to them-just as we observe our image in a mirror. However, as we can scientifically verify, this is clearly not true of the physiological components of the perceptual process. This also brings up the problem of [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] and its relation to representative realism, concerning the incongruous marriage of the metaphysical and the physical.

The new objection to the Homunculus Argument claims that it relies on a naive view of sensation.  Because the eyes respond to light rays is no reason for supposing that the visual field requires eyes to see it.  Visual sensation (the argument can be extrapolated to the other senses) bears no direct resemblance to the light rays at the retina, nor to the character of what they are reflected from or pass through or what was glowing at the origin of them.  The reason given is that they only bear the similarities of ''co-variation'' with what arrives at the retinas.&lt;ref&gt;Sellars, Roy Wood (1919), "The epistemology of evolutionary naturalism", Mind, 28:112, 407-26;  se p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as the currents in a wire going to a loudspeaker vary proportionately with the sounds that emanate from it but have no other likeness, so too does sensation vary proportionately (and not necessarily directly) with what causes it but bears no other resemblance to the input.  This implies that the colour we experience is actually a cortical occurrence, and that light rays and external surfaces are not themselves coloured.  The proportional variations with which cortical colour changes are there in the external world, but not colour as we experience it.  Contrary to what Gilbert Ryle believed, those who argue for sensations being brain processes do not have to hold that there is a "picture" in the brain since this is impossible according to this theory since actual pictures in the external world are not coloured.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmond (2005), ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke:  Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 96-102.&lt;/ref&gt; It is plain that Ryle unthinkingly carried over what the eyes do to the nature of sensation; A. J. Ayer at the time described Ryle's position as "very weak".&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, A. J. (1957) ''The Problem of Knowledge,'' Harmondsworth:  Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; So there is no "screen" in front of cortical "eyes", no mental objects before one. As Thomas Hobbes put it: "How do we take notice of sense?‚Äîby sense itself". Moreland Perkins has characterized it thus: that sensing is not like kicking a ball, but rather "kicking a kick".&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Thomas (1839 [1655]), ''Elements of Philosophy, The First Section: Concerning Body,'' London: John Bohn, p. 389;  Perkins, Moreland (1983), ''Sensing the World,'' Indianapolis IN: Hackett Pub. Co., pp. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are still philosophers arguing for colour being a property of external surfaces, light sources, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tye (2006), 'The puzzle of true blue', ''Analysis,'' 66: 173-78;  Matthen, Mohan (2009), 'Truly blue:  an adverbial aspect of perceptual representation', ''Analysis,'' 69:1, 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more fundamental criticism is implied in theories of this type. The differences at the sensory and perceptual levels between agents require that some means of ensuring at least a partial correlation can be achieved that allows the updatings involved in communication to take place.  The process in an informative statement begins with the parties hypothetically assuming that they are referring to the "same" entity or "property", even though their selections from their sensory fields cannot match; we can call this mutually imagined projection the "logical subject" of the statement.  The speaker then produces the logical predicate which effects the proposed updating of the "referent". If the statement goes through, the hearer will now have a different percept and concept of the "referent"‚Äîperhaps even seeing it now as two things and not one. The radical conclusion is that we are premature in conceiving of the external as already sorted into singular "objects" in the first place, since we only need to behave ''as if'' they are already logically singular.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmond (2005), ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke:  Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 103-120.&lt;/ref&gt; The diagram at the beginning of this entry would thus be thought of as a false picture of the actual case, since to draw "an" object as already selected from the real is only to treat the practically needful, but strictly false, hypothesis of objects-as-logically-singular as ontologically given. The proponents of this view thus argue that there is no need actually ''to believe'' in the singularity of an object since we can manage perfectly well by ''mutually imagining'' that 'it' is singular.  A proponent of this theory can thus ask the direct realist feels why he or she thinks it is necessary to move to taking the imagining of singularity for real when there is no practical difference in the outcome in action.  Therefore, although there are selections from our sensory fields which for the time being we treat as if they were objects, they are only provisional, open to corrections at any time, and, hence, far from being direct ''representations'' of pre-existing singularities, they retain an experimental character.  Virtual constructs or no, they remain, however, selections that are causally linked to the real and can surprise us at any time‚Äîwhich removes any danger of solipsism in this theory.  This approach dovetails with the philosophy known as [[social constructivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995), ''Radical Constructivism:  A Way of Knowing and Learning,'' London:  RoutledgeFalmer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of experience of a physical object can be altered in major ways by changes in the conditions of perception or of the relevant sense-organs and the resulting [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] processes, without change in the external physical object that initiates this process and that may seem to be depicted by the experience. Conversely any process that yields the same sensory/neural results will yield the same perceptual experience, no matter what the physical object that initiated the process may have been like. Furthermore, the causal process that intervenes between the external object and the perceptual experience takes time, so that the character of the experience reflects, at the most, an earlier stage of that object than the one existing at the moment of perception. As in observations of astronomical objects the external object may have ceased to exist long before the experience occurs. These facts are claimed to point to the conclusion that the direct object of experience is an entity produced at the end of this causal process, distinct from any physical object that initiates the process."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

==The adverbial theory==
The above argument invites the conclusion of a perceptual dualism that raises the issue of how and whether the object can be known by experience. The adverbial theory proposes "that this dualism is a dualism of ''objects'', with perceptual experience being a more direct experience of objects of a different sort, [[sense-data]]."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Perceptual dualism implies:&lt;blockquote&gt;both an ''act'' of awareness (or apprehension) and an ''object'' (the sense-datum) which that act apprehends or is an awareness of. The fundamental idea of the adverbial theory, in contrast, is that there is no need for such objects and the problems that they bring with them (such as whether they are physical or mental or somehow neither). Instead, it is suggested, merely the occurrence of a mental act or mental state with its own intrinsic character is enough to account for the character of immediate experience.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to the adverbial theory, when, for example, I experience a silver elliptical shape (as when viewing a coin from an angle) I am in a certain specific state of sensing or sensory awareness or of being appeared to: I sense in a certain manner or am appeared to in a certain way, and that specific manner of sensing or of being appeared to accounts for the content of my experience: I am in a certain distinctive sort of experiential state. There need be no object or entity of any sort that is literally silver and elliptical in the material world or in the mind. I experience a silver and [[Ellipse|elliptical]] shape because an object or entity that literally has that color and shape is directly before my mind. But the nature of these entities and the way in which they are related to the mind are difficult to understand. The adverbial theory has the advantage of being metaphysically simpler, avoiding issues about the nature of sense-data, but we gain no real understanding of the nature of the states in question or of how exactly they account for the character of immediate experience."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

[[Image:Ecotypes of Physcomitrella patens.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Four different [[ecotypes]] of ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'', stored at the [[International Moss Stock Center]]]]

In [[evolutionary ecology]], an '''ecotype''',&lt;ref group=note&gt;Greek: ''ŒøŒØŒ∫ŒøœÇ'' = home and ''œÑœçœÄŒøœÇ'' = type, coined by [[G√∂te Turesson]] in 1922&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called '''ecospecies''', describes a genetically distinct geographic variety, [[Population biology|population]] or [[Race (biology)|race]] within a [[species]], which is genotypically [[Adaptation|adapted]] to specific environmental conditions.

Typically, though ecotypes exhibit [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences (such as in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] or [[physiology]]) stemming from environmental heterogeneity, they are capable of interbreeding with other geographically adjacent ecotypes without loss of fertility or vigor.

(2006), p.5,6,7,8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G."&gt;{{cite book | last =Turesson | first =Turesson G. | title =The genotypical response of the plant species to the habitat | publisher =Hereditas 3 | year =1922 | pages =211‚Äì350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Molles"&gt;{{cite book | last =Molles | first =Manuel C., Jr. | title =Ecology: Concepts and Applications | publisher =The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.| edition = 3rd | year =2005 | location =New York | pages =201 | isbn = 978-0-07-243969-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ee"&gt;''Environmental Encyclopedia'' by Bortman, Brimblecombe, Mary Ann Cunningham, William P.

==Definition==
An ecotype is a variant in which the [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences are too few or too subtle to warrant being classified as a subspecies. These can occur in the same geographic region where distinct habitats such as meadow, forest, swamp, and sand dunes provide ecological niches. Where similar ecological conditions occur in widely separated places it is possible for a similar ecotype to occur. This is different than a subspecies, which may exist across a number of different habitats. In animals, ecotypes can be regarded as micro-subspecies that owe their differing characteristics to the effects of a very local environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernst Mayr|title=Systematics and the Origin of Species, from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|chapter=VIII-Nongeographic speciation|pages=194‚Äì195|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=mAIjnLp6r_MC&amp;pg=PA194|isbn=9780674862500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ecotypes have no [[taxonomic rank]].

==Terminology==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
Ecotypes are closely related to [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]]. In the context of [[evolutionary biology]], [[Polymorphism (biology)|genetic polymorphism]] is the occurrence in the equilibrium of two or more distinctly different phenotypes within a population of a species, in other words, the occurrence of more than one '''form''' or '''morph'''. The frequency of these discontinuous forms (even that of the rarest) is too high to be explained by [[mutation]]. In order to be classified as such, morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a [[panmictic]] population (whose all members can potentially interbreed). Polymorphism is actively and steadily maintained in populations of species by natural selection (most famously [[sexual dimorphism]] in humans) in contrast to ''transient polymorphisms'' where conditions in a habitat change in such a way that a "form" is being replaced completely by another.

In fact, Begon, Townsend, and Harper assert that

{{Cquote|''There is not always clear distinction between local ecotypes and genetic polymorphisms.''}}

The notions "form" and "ecotype" may appear to correspond to a static phenomenon, however; this is not always the case. Evolution occurs continuously both in time and space, so that two ecotypes or forms may qualify as distinct species in only a few generations. Begon, Townsend, and Harper use an illuminating analogy on this:

{{Cquote|''‚Ä¶ the origin of a species, whether [[Allopatric speciation|allopatric]] or [[Sympatric speciation|sympatric]], is a process, not an event. For the formation of a new species, like the boiling of an egg, there is some freedom to argue about when it is completed.''}}

Thus ecotypes and morphs can be thought of as precursory steps of potential [[speciation]].

==Range and distribution==
Experiments indicate that sometimes ecotypes manifest only when separated by great spatial distances (of the order of 1,000&amp;nbsp;km). This is due to [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] whereby different but adjacent varieties of the same species (or generally of the same [[taxonomic rank]]) interbreed, thus overcoming local selection. However other studies reveal that the opposite may happen, i.e., ecotypes revealing at very small scales (of the order of 10 m), within populations, and despite hybridization.&lt;ref name="BTH" /&gt;

In ecotypes, it is common for continuous, gradual geographic variation to impose analogous phenotypic and genetic variation.&lt;ref name="BTH" /&gt; This situation is called [[Cline (biology)|cline]]. A well-known example of a cline is the skin color gradation in indigenous human populations worldwide, which is related to latitude and amounts of sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;"Race".  (2009). ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica''. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; But often the distribution of ecotypes is [[Bimodal distribution|bimodal]] or multimodal. This means that ecotypes may display two or more distinct and discontinuous phenotypes even within the same population. Such phenomenon may lead to [[speciation]] and can occur if conditions in a local environment change dramatically through space or time.&lt;ref name="BTH" /&gt;

* [[Earthworms]] fall into four different ecotypes. Compost earthworms prefer warm and moist environments with a ready supply of fresh compost material. [[Epigeic]] earthworms live on the surface of the soil in [[leaf litter]] and tend not to make burrows but live in and feed on the leaf litter. Endogeic earthworms live in and feed on the soil, making horizontal burrows through the soil to move around and to feed and they will reuse these burrows to a certain extent. Anecic earthworms make permanent vertical burrows in soil, feeding on leaves on the soil surface that they drag into their burrows.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.earthwormsoc.org.uk/earthworm-information/earthworm-information-page-2 Earthworm ecotypes], information from the Earthworm Society of Britain about the different ecotypes of British earthworms.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Arabis|''Arabis fecunda'']], a herb [[Endemism|endemic]] to some [[calcareous]] soils of Montana, United States, can be divided into two ecotypes.

==History==

In 1892, Jos√© Francisco da Rocha Pombo, an intellectual of the state of Paran√° would have initiated the construction of the University, but his project was frustrated by the Federalist Movement.

Twenty years later, Paran√° had a reduced number of intellectuals (nine doctors and four engineers), but it was in true development because of the production of the [[yerba mate]].

Moreover, at this time, the [[Contestado War]] appeared as an incentive to the efforts of political leaderships concerning the creation of a university. In this context, [[Victor Ferreira do Amaral]], deputy and director of public instruction of Paran√°, started the effective creation of the University.

On December 19, 1912 the University was established and, in 1913, it has initiated its activities as a private institution in an old building situated on Comendador Ara√∫jo street. The first courses offered were [[Law|Juridical and Social Sciences]], Engineering, [[Medicine|Medicine and Surgery]], Commerce, [[Dentistry]], [[Pharmacy|Pharmacy and Obstetrics]]. After the establishment of the University, Victor Ferreira do Amaral, who was also its first president, initiated the construction of a central building in a land donated by the municipal government.

Due to the economic recession caused by the World War I, difficulties started to appear. In 1920, a federal law determined the closing of all universities. In a contradictory measure, the federal government created the ''Universidade do Rio de Janeiro'', currently ''[[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro]]'' (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). The alternative to this law was to split the UFPR in several colleges.

Throughout several years, efforts in order to restore the university took place. Only in the beginning of the fifties the colleges were reunited once again in the University of Paran√°, its federalization happening just after that, in 1951, when the university became a public and free-of-charge institution.

After its federalization, a process of expansion began with the construction of the Clinic's Hospital ('''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]:''' ''Hospital de Cl√≠nicas da Universidade Federal do Paran√°'') in 1953, the ''Reitoria'' Campus in 1958 and the Polytechnic Center in 1961. The Polytechnic Center campus occupies {{convert|617,128|m2|ft2}}.&lt;ref name="t"/&gt;

[[File:Pedra fundamental do pr√©dio ufpr.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Foundation stone inauguration]]

==Historical Building==
[[Image:Universidade Federal do Parana 4 Curitiba Parana.jpg|200px|right|thumb|UFPR ‚Äì ''Historic building at Santos Andrade Square, in Curitiba'']]
The construction placed in the Santos Andrade Square began to be built in 1913, being a project of the military engineer Baeta de Faria. Its inauguration occurred in 1915.

Seven years later, in 1923, two lateral parts were added, according to the original project. The building of the right sector was ended in 1925 and was designated to the Engineering graduation course. In the following year, the left sector had been finalized and it passed to serve the Dentistry course. Other additions were made to the right side of the building and it has received in its totality new paint in 1940. The building was extended towards XV de Novembro Street and, in 1952, new works in the right section led to the demolition of part of the lateral fa√ßade built in 1940.

In 1954, the building occupied a whole block between the Santos Andrade Square, XV de Novembro Street, Presidente Faria Street and Alfredo Bufren Lane. The last modifications were made: a new fa√ßade with several columns and a wide set of staircases were projected and the covered dome was eliminated. The inauguration of the neoclassical, 17,000 square meter building, took place in 1955.

In the year on 1999, the mayor of Curitiba signed a law that made this building the official symbol of the city.

===Technical High School===

Besides the above-mentioned courses, it offers high school education through its Technical High School. [http://www.et.ufpr.br/]

==Admissions==

Students are admitted by an entrance exam, known as the [[vestibular]], which consists of two parts:

*'''Part I''' is composed of 80 multiple-choice questions including nine questions of each of the following subjects: Portuguese, Literature, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Geography, History and Biology, plus eight questions of a foreign language which can be chosen from English, French, Spanish, German or Italian.

Over 50,000 people apply every year and sit for exactly the same exam. After two weeks time or so, 15,000 are called to take the Part II (or Phase II) written exams.

*'''Part II''' is composed of a Portuguese test which covers five (previously seven) compulsory writing essays. Certain courses require that the candidate take an additional one or two exams involving open-questions in Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Geography, History, Biology, Philosophy or [[Sociology]], the specific exam choice being determined by correlation between the subject and each major course. Engineering candidates, for example, take Mathematics and Physics tests.

The wait for the results of Part II is much longer and the results may take something between 4 and 7 weeks. A list with all the admitted candidates comes out usually in the middle of January‚Äîon the same day as the ''Mud-bath Party'' sponsored by the Central Directory of Students ('''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]:''' Diret√≥rio Central dos Estudantes, DCE) occurs.

'''Foreshadowing''' is a [[Literary technique|literary device]] in which a writer gives an advance hint of what is to come later in the story. Foreshadowing often appears at the beginning of a story, or a chapter, and it helps the reader develop expectations about the upcoming events. 

A writer may implement foreshadowing in many different ways.  Some of these ways include: character dialogues, plot events, and changes in setting. Even the title of a work or a chapter can act as a clue that suggests what is going to happen. Foreshadowing in fiction creates an atmosphere of suspense in a story, so that the readers are interested and want to know more.

This literary device is generally used to build anticipation in the minds of readers about what might happen next, thus adding dramatic tension to a story.  Moreover, foreshadowing can make extraordinary and bizarre events appear credible, as the events are predicted beforehand so that readers are mentally prepared for them. &lt;ref name=devices&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreshadowing|url=https://literarydevices.net/foreshadowing/|website=Literarydevices.net|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This literary device is frequently adapted for use by [[composer]]s of theatrical music, in the composition of [[opera]]s, [[musicals]], [[radio]], film, [[television]], [[Video game|gaming]], podcast, and internet scores and [[underscoring|underscores]], and [[incidental music]] for spoken theatrical productions.

==Misconceptions==
Foreshadowing is often confused with other [[literary techniques]]. Some of these techniques include:
* A "[[red herring (plot device)|red herring]]", is a hint that is designed to mislead the audience. However, foreshadowing only hints at a possible outcome within the confinement of a narrative, and purposely leads readers in the right direction. 
* A "[[flashforward]]" is a scene that takes the [[narrative]] forward in time from the current point of the story in [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], and other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ulrike Spierling|author2=Nicolas Szilas|title=Interactive Storytelling: First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008 Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIkhA9zuvSUC&amp;pg=PA156|date=3 December 2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-89424-7|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flash-forward flash-forward - definition of flash-forward by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Foreshadowing is sometimes employed  through characters' explicitly predicting the future.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 146, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By analogy to foreshadowing, the literary critic Gary Morson describes its opposite, '''sideshadowing'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morson|first1=Gary Saul|title=Sideshadowing and Tempics|journal=New Literary History|date=Autumn 1998|volume=29|issue=4|pages=599‚Äì624|jstor=20057502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Found notably in the epic novels of [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], it is the practice of including scenes that turn out to have no relevance to the plot. This, according to Morson, increases the verisimilitude of the fiction because the audience knows that in real life, unlike in novels, most events are in fact inconsequential. This "sense of structurelessness" invites the audience to "interpret and question the events that actually do come to pass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Calixto|first1=Joshua|title=LET‚ÄôS TALK ABOUT ROSA VAR ATTRE, THE IMPOSSIBLE ROMANCE OF THE WITCHER 3|url=http://killscreendaily.com/articles/lets-talk-about-rosa-var-attre-impossible-romance-witcher-3/|accessdate=3 August 2015|work=[[Kill Screen]]|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great American Interchange''' was an important late [[Cenozoic]] [[zoogeography|paleozoogeographic]] event in which land and freshwater [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] migrated from North America via Central America to South America and vice versa, as the volcanic [[Isthmus of Panama]] rose up from the sea floor and bridged the formerly separated [[continent]]s. Although there were earlier dispersals, probably over water, the migration accelerated dramatically about 2.7 million years ([[Ma (unit)|Ma]]) ago during the [[Piacenzian]] age.&lt;ref name="ODea2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= O'Dea|first1= A.|last2= Lessios|first2=H.

The interchange is visible from observation of both [[biostratigraphy]] and nature ([[neontology]]). Its most dramatic effect is on the [[zoogeography]] of [[mammal]]s but it also gave an opportunity for [[reptile]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[arthropod]]s, weak-flying or [[flightless bird]]s, and even [[freshwater fish]] to migrate.

The notoungulates and litopterns had many strange forms, like ''[[Macrauchenia]]'', a camel-like litoptern with a small [[proboscis]]. They also produced a number of familiar-looking body types that represent examples of [[parallel evolution|parallel]] or [[convergent evolution]]: one-toed ''[[Thoatherium]]'' had legs like those of a horse, ''[[Pachyrukhos]]'' resembled a rabbit, ''[[Homalodotherium]]'' was a semi-bipedal clawed browser like a [[chalicothere]], and horned ''[[Trigodon]]'' looked like a [[Rhinoceros|rhino]]. Both groups started evolving in the Lower Paleocene, possibly from [[condylarth]] stock, diversified, dwindled before the great interchange, and went [[Extinction|extinct]] at the end of the [[Pleistocene]]. The pyrotheres and astrapotheres were also strange but were less diverse and disappeared earlier, well before the interchange.

The North American fauna was a typical [[boreoeutheria]]n one, supplemented with [[Afrotheria]]n [[Proboscidea|proboscids]].

The formation of the Isthmus of Panama led to the last and most conspicuous wave, the great interchange, around 3&amp;nbsp;Ma ago.

The larger members of the reverse migration, besides ground sloths and terror birds, were [[glyptodont]]s, [[Pampatheriidae|pampathere]]s, [[Neochoerus pinckneyi|capybaras]] and the notoungulate ''[[Mixotoxodon]]'' (the only South American ungulate known to have invaded Central America).

In general, the initial net migration was symmetrical. Later on, however, the Neotropic species proved far less successful than the Nearctic. This misfortune happened both ways.

Due in large part to the continued success of the xenarthrans, one area of South American [[ecospace]] the Nearctic invaders were unable to dominate was the niches for megaherbivores.&lt;ref name = "Cione"/&gt; Before 12,000 years ago, South America was home to about 25 species of herbivores weighing more than 1000&amp;nbsp;kg, consisting of Neotropic ground sloths, glyptodonts and toxodontids, as well as gomphotheres and camelids of Nearctic origin.{{refn|group=n|P.

Armadillos, opossums and porcupines are present in North America today because of the Great American Interchange. Opossums and porcupines were among most successful northward migrants, reaching as far as Canada and [[Alaska]], respectively. Most major groups of xenarthrans were present in North America up until the end-[[Pleistocene]] [[Quaternary extinction event]] (as a result of at least eight successful invasions of temperate North America, and at least six more invasions of Central America only).

[[File:Americas K√∂ppen Map.png|thumb|upright=1.1|A north-south climatic asymmetry in the Americas. Tropical climate zones, which are warm year-round and moist at least part of the year (blue zones [[Equatorial climate|Af]], [[Monsoon|Am]] and [[Tropical savanna climate|Aw]]), cover much of South America and nearly all of Central America, but very little of the rest of North America.]]

The eventual triumph of the Nearctic migrants was ultimately based on [[geography]], which played into the hands of the northern invaders in two crucial respects. The first was a matter of [[climate]]. Any species that reached [[Panama]] from either direction obviously had to be able to tolerate [[K√∂ppen climate classification#GROUP A: Tropical/megathermal climates|moist tropical conditions]]. Those migrating southward would then be able to occupy much of South America without encountering climates that were markedly different. However, northward migrants would have encountered drier and/or cooler conditions by the time they reached the vicinity of the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]]. The challenge this climatic asymmetry (see map on right) presented was particularly acute for Neotropic species specialized for [[tropical rainforest]] environments, who had little prospect of penetrating beyond Central America.

These advantages can be clearly seen in the cases of ungulates and their predators, where South American forms were replaced wholesale by the invaders.

The greater eventual success of South America's African immigrants compared to its native early Cenozoic mammal fauna is another example of this phenomenon, since the former evolved over a greater land area; their ancestors migrated from [[Eurasia]] to [[Africa]], two significantly larger continents, before finding their way to [[South America]].&lt;ref name = "Chaimanee"/&gt;

Against this backdrop, the ability of South America's [[xenarthra]]ns to compete effectively against the northerners represents a special case. The explanation for the xenarthrans' success lies in part in their idiosyncratic approach to defending against [[predation]], based on possession of [[Animal shell|body armor]] and/or formidable [[claw]]s. The xenarthrans did not need to be fleet-footed or quick-witted to survive. Such a strategy may have been forced on them by their low [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]] (the lowest among the [[theria]]ns).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

At the end of the [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene epoch]], about 12,000 years ago, three dramatic developments occurred in the Americas at roughly the same time (geologically speaking). [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Paleoindians]] invaded and occupied the [[New World]], the [[last glacial period]] came to an end, and a large fraction of the [[megafauna]] of both North and South America went extinct. This [[Quaternary extinction event|wave of extinctions]] swept off the face of the Earth many of the successful participants of the Great American Interchange, as well as other species that had not migrated.

Some groups disappeared over most or all of their original range but survived in their adopted homes, e.g. South American tapirs, camelids and tremarctine bears (cougars and jaguars may have been temporarily reduced to South American [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] also). Others, such as capybaras, survived in their original range but died out in areas they had migrated to. Notably, this extinction pulse eliminated all Neotropic migrants to North America larger than about 15&amp;nbsp;kg (the size of a big [[North American porcupine|porcupine]]), and all native South American mammals larger than about 65&amp;nbsp;kg (the size of a big capybara or [[giant anteater]]). In contrast, the largest surviving native North American mammal, the [[wood bison]], can exceed 900&amp;nbsp;kg, and the largest surviving Nearctic migrant to South America, [[Baird's tapir]], can reach 400&amp;nbsp;kg.

The climate change took place worldwide, but had little effect on the megafauna in areas like Africa and southern Asia, where megafaunal species had coevolved with [[Homo (genus)|humans]]. Numerous [[:Image:Five Myr Climate Change.png|very similar]] [[:Image:Atmospheric CO2 with glaciers cycles.gif|glacial retreats]] had occurred previously within the [[ice age]] of the last several Ma without ever producing comparable waves of extinction in the Americas or anywhere else.

The reason that a number of groups went extinct in North America but lived on in South America (while there are no examples of the opposite pattern) appears to be that the dense rainforest of the [[Amazon basin]] and the high peaks of the [[Andes]] provided environments that afforded a degree of protection from human predation.&lt;ref name = "islands&amp;continents"&gt;{{Cite book

(Cheetahs in the broadest sense could be added to this list, although the [[American cheetah|New]] and [[Cheetah|Old World]] forms are in different genera.) Old World herbivores may in many cases have been able to learn to be vigilant about the presence of humans during a more gradual appearance (by development or migration) of advanced human hunters in their ranges. In the cases of predators, the Old World representatives in at least some locations would thus have suffered less from extinctions of their prey species. In contrast, the [[Muskox|musk ox]] represents a rare example of a megafaunal taxon that recently became extinct in Asia but survived in remote areas of [[arctic]] North America (its more southerly-distributed relatives such as [[Harlan's muskox|Harlan's musk ox]] and the [[Shrub-ox|shrub ox]] were less fortunate).}}

[[Image:Surface water cycle.svg|thumb|Water balance]]
'''Groundwater recharge''' or '''deep drainage''' or '''deep percolation''' is a [[Hydrology|hydrologic]] process where [[water]] moves downward from [[surface water]] to [[groundwater]]. Recharge is the primary method through which water enters an [[aquifer]].  This process usually occurs in the [[vadose zone]] below plant [[root]]s and is often expressed as a [[flux]] to the [[water table]] surface. Recharge occurs both naturally (through the [[water cycle]]) and through anthropogenic processes (i.e., "artificial groundwater recharge"), where rainwater and or [[reclaimed water]] is routed to the subsurface.

==Processes==
Groundwater is recharged naturally by [[rain]] and [[snow]] melt and to a smaller extent by surface water (rivers and lakes). Recharge  may be impeded somewhat by human activities including paving, development, or [[logging]].  These activities can result in loss of topsoil resulting in reduced water infiltration, enhanced [[surface runoff]] and reduction in recharge. Use of groundwaters, especially for [[irrigation]], may also lower the water tables. Groundwater recharge is an important process for [[sustainable]] groundwater management, since the volume-rate [[water abstraction|abstracted]] from an [[aquifer]] in the long term should be less than or equal to the volume-rate that is recharged.

Recharge can help move excess salts that accumulate in the root zone to deeper soil layers, or into the groundwater system. Tree roots increase water [[Soil#Soil water|saturation]] into [[groundwater]] reducing water [[Surface runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref name="trees water infiltration"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.agronomy.org/news-media/releases/2008/1117/221/ | title=Urban Trees Enhance Water Infiltration | publisher=The American Society of Agronomy | work=Fisher, Madeline | date=November 17, 2008 | accessdate=October 31, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602034025/https://www.agronomy.org/news-media/releases/2008/1117/221/ | archivedate=June 2, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Flooding]] temporarily increases [[stream bed|river bed]] [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] by moving clay soils downstream, and this increases aquifer recharge.&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.science.unsw.edu.au/news/major-floods-recharge-aquifers/ | title=Major floods recharge aquifers | publisher=University of New South Wales Science | date=January 24, 2011 | accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial groundwater recharge is becoming increasingly important in India, where [[Overdrafting|over-pumping]] of groundwater by farmers has led to underground resources becoming depleted. In 2007, on the recommendations of the [[International Water Management Institute]], the Indian government allocated {{INRConvert|1800|c|year=2007}} to fund dug-well [[Aquifer storage and recovery|recharge projects]] (a dug-well is a wide, shallow well, often lined with concrete) in 100 districts within seven states where water stored in hard-rock aquifers had been over-exploited. Another environmental issue is the disposal of waste through the water flux such as dairy farms, industrial, and urban [[Surface runoff|runoff]].

===Wetlands===
[[Wetlands]] help maintain the level of the water table and exert control on the hydraulic head (O'Brien 1988; Winter 1988). This provides force for groundwater recharge and discharge to other waters as well. The extent of groundwater recharge by a wetland is dependent upon [[soil type|soil]], [[vegetation]], site, perimeter to volume ratio, and water table gradient (Carter and Novitzki 1988; Weller 1981). Groundwater recharge occurs through [[soil type|mineral soils]] found primarily around the edges of wetlands (Verry and Timmons 1982) The soil under most wetlands is relatively impermeable. A high perimeter to volume ratio, such as in small wetlands, means that the surface area through which water can infiltrate into the groundwater is high (Weller 1981). Groundwater recharge is typical in small wetlands such as [[Prairie Pothole Region|prairie potholes]], which can contribute significantly to recharge of regional groundwater resources (Weller 1981). Researchers have discovered groundwater recharge of up to 20% of wetland volume per season (Weller 1981).

===Depression-focused recharge===
If water falls uniformly over a field such that [[field capacity]] of the soil is not exceeded, then negligible water percolates to [[groundwater]].  If instead water puddles in low-lying areas, the same water volume concentrated over a smaller area may exceed field capacity resulting in water that percolates down to recharge groundwater.  The larger the relative contributing runoff area is, the more focused infiltration is.  The recurring process of water that falls relatively uniformly over an area, flowing to groundwater selectively under surface depressions is depression focused recharge.  Water tables rise under such depressions.

====Depression pressure====
Depression focused groundwater recharge can be very important in [[arid region]]s.  More rain events are capable of contributing to groundwater supply.

Depression focused groundwater recharge also profoundly effects [[contaminant]] transport into groundwater.  This is of great concern in regions with [[karst]] geological formations because water can eventually dissolve tunnels all the way to [[aquifer]]s, or otherwise disconnected streams.  This extreme form of preferential flow, accelerates the transport of contaminants and the [[erosion]] of such [[tunnel]]s.  In this way depressions intended to trap [[Surface runoff|runoff]] water‚Äîbefore it flows to vulnerable water resources‚Äîcan connect underground over time.  [[Cavitation]] of surfaces above into the tunnels, results in [[pothole]]s or caves.

Deeper ponding exerts [[pressure]] that forces water into the ground faster.  Faster flow dislodges contaminants otherwise adsorbed on soil and carries them along. This can carry [[pollution]] directly to the raised [[water table]] below and into the [[groundwater supply]].  Thus the quality of water collecting in [[infiltration basin]]s is of special concern.

====Pollution====
Pollution in stormwater [[Surface runoff|runoff]] collects in retention basins.  Concentrating degradable contaminants can accelerate [[biodegradation]].  However, where and when water tables are high this affects appropriate design of [[detention pond]]s, [[retention pond]]s and [[rain garden]]s.

==Estimation methods==

Rates of groundwater recharge are difficult to quantify since other related processes, such as [[evaporation]], [[transpiration]] (or [[evapotranspiration]]) and [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] processes must first be measured or estimated to determine the balance.

===Physical===

Physical methods use the principles of [[soil physics]] to estimate recharge. The ''direct'' physical methods are those that attempt to actually measure the volume of water passing below the root zone. ''Indirect'' physical methods rely on the measurement or estimation of soil physical parameters, which along with soil physical principles, can be used to estimate the potential or actual recharge. After months without rain the level of the rivers under humid climate is low and represents solely drained groundwater. Thus, the recharge can be calculated from this base flow if the catchment area is already known.

===Chemical===

Chemical methods use the presence of relatively [[Chemically inert|inert]] water-soluble substances, such as an [[isotopic tracer]] or [[chloride]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allison |first=G.B. |author2=Hughes, M.W. |year=1978 |title=The use of environmental chloride and tritium to estimate total recharge to an unconfined aquifer |journal=Australian Journal of Soil Research |volume=16 |pages=181‚Äì195 |doi=10.1071/SR9780181 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving through the soil, as deep drainage occurs.

===Numerical models===

Recharge can be estimated using [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]], using such [[Source code|codes]] as [[Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance]], [[UNSAT-H]], [[SHAW]], [[Weap|WEAP]], and [[MIKE SHE]]. The 1D-program [[Hydrus (software)|HYDRUS1D]] is available online. The codes generally use [[climate]] and [[soil]] data to arrive at a recharge estimate and use the [[Richards equation]] in some form to model groundwater flow in the [[vadose zone]].

A '''historical figure''' is a famous person in [[history]], such as [[Catherine the Great]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George Washington]], or [[Napoleon]].

The significance of such figures in human progress has been debated. Some think they play a crucial role, while others say they have little impact on the broad currents of thought and social change.  The concept is generally used in the sense that the person really existed in the past, as opposed to being legendary.  However, the legends that can grow up around historical figures may be hard to distinguish from fact.  Sources are often incomplete and may be inaccurate, particularly those from early periods of history. Without a body of personal documents, the more subtle aspects of personality of a historical figure can only be deduced. With historical figures who were also religious figures attempts to separate fact from belief may be controversial.

In education, presenting information as if it were being told by a historical figure may give it greater impact. Since classical times, students have been asked to put themselves in the place of a historical figure as a way of bringing history to life. Historical figures are often represented in fiction, where fact and fancy are combined. In earlier traditions, before the rise of a critical historical tradition, authors took less care to be as accurate when describing what they knew of historical figures and their actions, interpolating imaginary elements intended to serve a moral purpose to events: such is [[Notker the Stammerer|the Monk of St. Gall]]'s anecdotal account of [[Charlemagne]], ''De Carolo Magno''. More recently there has been a tendency once again for authors to freely depart from the "facts" when they conflict with their creative goals.

==Significance==
The significance of historical figures has long been the subject of debate by philosophers. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770‚Äì1831) considered that "world-historical figures" played a pivotal role in human progress, but felt that they were bound to emerge when change was needed. [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1795‚Äì1881) saw the study of figures such as [[Muhammad]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]] as key to understanding history. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820‚Äì1903), an early believer in evolution and in the universality of natural law, felt that historical individuals were of little importance.

===Hegel's world-historical figure===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] introduced the concept of the "world-historical figure".]]
The German philosopher Hegel defined the concept of the world-historical figure, who embodied the ruthless advance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s World Spirit, often overthrowing outdated structures and ideas.  To him, [[Napoleon]] was such a figure.{{sfn|Hagen|2012|p=125}}
Hegel proposed that a world-historical figure essentially posed a challenge, or thesis, and this would generate an antithesis, or opposing force. Eventually a synthesis would resolve the conflict.{{sfn|Van Doren|2008|p=277}}
Hegel viewed [[Julius Caesar]] as a world historical figure, who appeared at a stage when Rome had grown to the point it could no longer continue as a republican city state but had to become an empire.  Caesar failed in his bid to make himself an emperor, and was assassinated, but the empire came into existence soon afterward, and Caesar's name has become synonymous with "emperor" in forms such as "[[kaiser]]" or "[[czar]]".{{sfn|Karatani|2011|p=20}}

[[S√∏ren Kierkegaard]], in his early essay ''The Concept of Irony'', generally agrees with Hegel's views, such as his characterization of [[Socrates]] as a world-historical figure who acted as a destructive force on Greek received views of morality.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=179}}
In Hegel's view, Socrates broke down social harmony by questioning the meaning of concepts like "justice" and "virtue".
Eventually, the Athenians quite rightly *(Name source) condemned Socrates to death. But they could not stop the evolution of thought that Socrates had begun, which would lead to the concept of individual conscience.{{sfn|Magee|2001|p=192}}
Hegel said of world-historical figures,
{{blockquote|It was theirs to know this nascent principle; the necessary, directly sequent step in progress, which their world was to take; to make this their aim, and to expend their energy in promoting it ... They die early like Alexander; they are murdered, like Caesar; transported to St. Helena, like Napoleon ... They are ''great'' men, because they willed and accomplished something great; not a mere fancy, a mere intention, but that which met the case and fell in with the needs of the age.{{sfn|Cramer|2007|p=272}}}}

However, Hegel, [[Thomas Carlyle]] and others noted that the great historical figures were just representative men, expressions of the material forces of history.  Essentially they have little choice about what they do. This is in conflict with the views of [[George Bancroft]] or [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who praised self-reliance and individualism, and in conflict with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], who also felt that individuals can determine their destiny.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=5}}
Engels found that Hegel's system contained an "internal and incurable contradiction", resting as it does on both [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical relativism]] and idealistic absolutism.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=xv}}

===Spencerian view===
[[File:Spencer1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herbert Spencer]], who considered events in the lives of kings "historic trivalities"]]
The Scottish philosopher and evolutionist [[Herbert Spencer]], who was highly influential in the latter half of the nineteenth century, felt that historical figures were relatively unimportant.
He wrote to a friend, "I ignore utterly the personal element in history, and, indeed, show little respect for history altogether as it is ordinarily conceived."
He wrote, "The births, deaths,  and marriages of kings, and other like historic trivialities, are committed to memory, not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result from knowing them:  but because society considers them parts of a good education."{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188}}
In his essay ''What Knowledge Is of Most Worth?'' he wrote:
{{blockquote|That which constitutes History,  properly so called, is in great part omitted from works on the subject. Only of late years have historians commenced giving us, in any considerable quantity, the truly valuable information. As in past ages the king was everything and the people nothing; So, in past histories, the doings of the king fill the entire picture, to which the national life forms but an obscure background. While only now, when the welfare of nations rather than of rulers is becoming the dominant idea, are historians beginning to occupy themselves with the phenomena of social progress. The thing it really concerns us to know is the natural history of society.{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188-189}}}}

===Inevitability or determinism===
Taken to an extreme, one may consider that what Hegel calls the "world spirit" and [[T. S. Eliot]] calls "those vast impersonal forces" hold us in their grip.  What happens is predetermined.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}} 
Both Hegel and Marx advocated historical inevitability in contrast to the doctrine of contingency, allowing for alternative outcomes, that was advocated by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]] and others.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2011|p=chapter 9}}
However, Marx argued against the use of the  "historical inevitability" argument when used to explain the destruction of early communes in Russia.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2009|p=158}}
As an orthodox Marxist, [[Vladimir Lenin]] accepted the laws of history that Marx had discovered, including the historical inevitability of capitalism followed by a transition to socialism.
Despite this, Lenin also believed the transition could be effected faster by voluntary action.{{sfn|Chen|2007|p=37}}

In 1936 [[Karl Popper]] published an influential paper on ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', published as a book in 1957, that attacked the doctrine of historical inevitability.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=218}}
The historian [[Isaiah Berlin]], author of ''Historical Inevitability'', also argued forcibly against this view, going as far as to say that some choices are entirely free and cannot be predicted scientifically.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}}
Berlin presented his views in a 1953 lecture at the [[London School of Economics]], published soon afterwards.  When speaking he referred to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s views, but the published version speaks approvingly of Karl Popper, which caused a stir among academics.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=152}}

===Heroic view===
[[File:Carlyle by Elliott &amp; Fry c1860s.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Carlyle]], champion of study of great men]]
[[Thomas Carlyle]] has espoused the "heroic view" of history, famously saying in his essay on the Norse god [[Odin]] in his book ''On heroes, hero-worship, &amp; the heroic in history'' that "No great man lives in vain. The History of the world is but the Biography of great men ... We do not now call our great men Gods, nor admire ''without'' limit; ah no, ''with'' limit enough! But if we have no great men, or do not admire at all,‚Äî that were a still worse case."{{sfn|Carlyle|1841|p=47}}
Carlyle's historical philosophy was based on the "[[Great Man theory]]", saying, "Universal History, the history of what man has accomplished in the world ... [is] at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here."
An extreme believer in individuality, he also believed that the masses of people should let themselves be guided by the great leaders of men.{{sfn|Carlyle|2007|p=9}}
Talking of poets he said,
{{blockquote|That ideal outline of himself, which a man unconsciously shadows forth in his writings, and which, if rightly deciphered, will be truer than any other representation of him, it is the task of the Biographer to fill-up into an actual coherent figure, and to bring him to our experience, or at least our clear undoubted admiration, thereby to instruct and edify us in many ways. Conducted on such principles, the Biography of great men, especially of great Poets, that is, of men in the highest degree noble-minded and wise, might become one of the most dignified and valuable species of composition.{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=138}}}}
More recently, in his 1943 book ''The Hero in History'', the [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] scholar [[Sidney Hook]] asserts:
{{blockquote|That history is made by men and women is no longer denied except by some theologians and mystical metaphysicians.  And even they are compelled indirectly to acknowledge this commonplace truth, for they speak of historical personages as 'instruments' of Providence, Justice, Reason, Dialectic, the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', or Spirit of the Times.  Men agree more readily about the consequences of the use of 'instruments' in history than they do about the ultimate ends 'instruments' allegedly serve, or the first causes by which they are allegedly determined.{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xi}}}}
Hook recognizes the relevance of the environment within which the "great man" or "hero" acted, but asserts that this can provide the backdrop but never the plot of the "dramas of human history". and distinguish life and species{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xiii}}

===Ranking===
[[File:Crucifixion by Jacob Jordaens.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The crucifixion of Jesus, the founder of [[Christianity]], painted by [[Jacob Jordaens]] in the 17th century.]]
There have been rankings of the significance of major historical figures.  For example, [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]] and colleagues at the [[MIT Media Lab]] has calculated the memorability of historical figures using data such as the number of language editions for which there are articles for each person, the pageviews received, and other factors.  These lists are available at MIT's [http://pantheon.media.mit.edu Pantheon ] project.

==Historical truth==
It is sometimes hard to discern whether apparently historical figures from the earliest periods did in fact exist, due to the lack of records.  Even with more recent personages, stories or anecdotes about the person often accumulate that have no basis in fact.  Although the external aspects of a historical figure may be well documented, their inner nature can only be a subject of speculation.  With religious figures, often the subjects of voluminous literature, separating "fact" from "belief" can be difficult if not impossible.

===Ancient figures===
With older texts it can be difficult to be sure whether a person in the text is, in fact, a historical figure. "Wisdom literature" from early middle-eastern cultures (such as the [[Book of Job]]), mainly consist of verbal expositions or discussions that must be considered the work of the author, rather than the character supposedly speaking. It may still be possible to identify a figure in such texts with a historical figure known from some other context, and the text may be taken as informative about this figure, even if not verified by an independent source.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=335}} On the other hand, a text may include realistic settings and references to historical people, while the central character may or may not be a historical figure.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=336}}

===Fables===
[[File:Lady Godiva (John Collier, c. 1897).jpg|thumb|[[Lady Godiva]] was a historical figure, but there is no evidence that the legend of her riding naked through the streets is true (''[[Lady Godiva (painting)|Lady Godiva]]'' painting, 1897 by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]])]]

Napoleon spoke of history as being a [[fable]] which had been agreed upon:‚Äì "''la fable convenue qu'on appellera l'histoire''".{{sfn|Napoleon &amp; Auguste-Dieudonn√© 1823|p=242}} Great figures of the past have stories told about them which grow in the telling, and so become [[myth]]s and [[legend]]s which may dominate or displace the more prosaic historical facts about them. For example, some ancient chroniclers said that the Emperor [[Nero]] fiddled while Rome burned, but [[Tacitus]] disputed this by saying the stories were just malicious rumours. Similarly, there is no good evidence that [[Marie-Antoinette]] ever said "let them eat cake", or that [[Lady Godiva]] rode naked through the streets of [[Coventry]].{{sfn|Andrews|2012}}

===Personality===
[[Thomas Carlyle]] pointed out that even to the person living it, every life "remains in so many points unintelligible".  The historian must struggle when writing biographies, "the very facts of which, to say nothing of the purport of them, we know not, and cannot know!"{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=133-134}}
Some psychologists have sought to understand the personalities of historical figures through clues about the way in which they were raised. However, this theoretical psychoanalytic approach is not supported empirically. An alternative approach, favored by [[Psychobiography|psychobiographers]] such as [[William Runyan]], is to explain the personality of the historical figure in terms of their life history. This approach has the advantage of recognizing that personality may evolve over time in response to events.{{sfn|Roberts|1996|p=208}}

[[File:Confucius Laozi Buddha.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Three great historical figures ‚Äî [[Confucius]] presenting the [[Buddha]] to [[Lao Tsu]]. They are all of such antiquity that the historical facts about them are now overlaid with centuries of myth and legend.]]

===Religious figures===
With historical religious figures, fact and belief may be difficult to disentangle.
There are cultural differences in the treatment of historical figures. Thus the Chinese can recognise that [[Mencius]] or [[Confucius]] were historical individuals, while also endowing them with sanctity. In Indian [[Hinduism]], on the other hand, figures such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]] are almost always seen as embodiments of gods rather than as historical people. The [[Nirvana Sutra]] states: "Do not rely on the man but on the Dharma." A teacher such as [[Gautama Buddha]] is thus treated almost exclusively as a lesser god rather than a historical figure.{{sfn|Yuasa|Kasulis|1987|p=128}}

[[E. P. Sanders]], author of ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'', called Jesus of Nazareth "one of the most important figures in human history".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=1}} Various writers have struggled to present [[Historical Jesus|"historical" views of Jesus]], as opposed to views distorted by belief.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}} When writing about this subject, a historian who relies only on sources other than the [[New Testament]] may be criticized for implying that it is not a sufficient source of information about the subject.{{sfn|Habermas|1996|p=11}}

The theologian [[Martin K√§hler]] is known for his work ''Der sogenannte historische Jesus und der geschichtliche, biblische Christus'' (The so-called historical Jesus, and the historic, biblical Christ). He clearly distinguished between "the Jesus of history" and "the Christ of faith".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=4}} Some historians openly admit bias, which may anyway be unavoidable. Paul Hollenback says he writes about the historical Jesus, "...in order to overthrow, not simply correct, the mistake called Christianity."  Another historian who has written about Jesus, Frederick Gaiser, says, "historical investigation is part and parcel of biblical faith."{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}}

{{clear}}

==Political appropriation==
[[File:Stilke Hermann Anton - Joan of Arc's Death at the Stake.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1843 view of a heroic [[Joan of Arc]] at the stake.]]
A historical figure may be interpreted to support political aims.
In France in the first half of the seventeenth century,&lt;!--didn't the big Joan thing take place around the time of Napoleon?--&gt; there was an outpouring of writing about [[Joan of Arc]], including seven biographies, three plays and an epic poem. Joan had become a symbol of national pride and the Catholic faith, helping unite a country that had been divided by the recent [[French Wars of Religion|wars of religion]].  The reality of the historical Joan was subordinated to the need for a symbol of feminine strength, Christian virtue and resistance to the English.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=1}}
[[George Bernard Shaw]], introducing his 1923 play ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', discussed representations of Joan by other authors.
He felt that [[William Shakespeare]]'s depiction in ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' was constrained from making her a "beautiful and romantic figure" by political considerations. [[Voltaire]]'s version in his poem ''[[La Pucelle d'Orl√©ans]]'' was also flawed by Voltaire's biases and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s play ''[[Die Jungfrau von Orleans]]'' "is not about Joan at all, and can hardly be said to pretend to be."{{sfn|Innes|1998|p=208}}

A historical figure may be used to validate a politician's claim to authority,
where the modern leader shapes and exploits the ideas associated with the historical figure,
which they are presumed to have inherited.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=60}}
Thus [[Jesse Jackson]] has frequently evoked the spirit of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=51}}
[[Fidel Castro]] often presented himself as following the path defined by [[Jos√© Mart√≠]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=64}}
[[Hugo Ch√°vez]] of Venezuela has frequently identified himself with the historical figure [[Sim√≥n Bol√≠var]], the liberator of South America from Spanish rule.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=125}}

Hegel believed in the role of the state in guaranteeing individual liberties, and his views were therefore rejected by the German National Socialists, who considered him dangerously liberal and perhaps a proto-Marxist. On the other hand, [[Adolf Hitler]] identified himself as a Hegelian world historical figure, and justified his actions on this basis.{{sfn|Cobley|2002|p=278}}

==In education==
[[Plato]] used historical figures in his writing, but only to illustrate his points. [[Xenophon]] used [[Cyrus the Great]] in the same way.
When Plato apparently quotes [[Socrates]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', it is only to add dramatic effect to the presentation of his own thought.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} For this reason, Plato's writings on Socrates tell us little, at least directly, about Socrates. The historical figure is used only as a device for communicating Plato's ideas.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} In classical Rome, students of rhetoric had to master the ''[[suasoria]]'' ‚Äî a form of [[declamation]] in which they wrote the soliloquy of a historical figure who was debating a critical course of action.  For example, the poet [[Juvenal]] wrote a speech for the dictator [[Sulla]], in which he was counselled to retire. The poet [[Ovid]] enjoyed this exercise more than the other final challenge ‚Äî the ''[[controversia]]''.{{sfn|Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics|p=212}}

The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote an influential essay "On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life". He said "the unhistorical and historical are necessary in equal measure for the health of an individual, of a people and of a culture."{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=2}}
Nietzsche identifies three approaches to history, each with dangers.
The monumental approach describes the glories of the past, often focusing on heroic figures like [[Elizabeth I of England]] or [[Louis Pasteur]]. 
By treating these figures as models, the student is tempted to consider that there can be nobody of such stature today.
The antiquarian view examines the past in minute and reverent detail, turning its back on the present.
The critical approach challenges traditional views, even though they may be valid.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=3}}

Historical figures may today be simulated as [[animated pedagogical agent]]s to teach history and foreign culture. An example is [[Freudbot]], which acted the part of [[Sigmund Freud]] for psychology students. When a variety of simulated character types were tried as educational agents, students rated historical figures as the most engaging.{{sfn|Veletsianos|2010|p=16}}
There are [[gender difference]]s in the perception of historical figures.  When modern US schoolchildren were asked to roleplay or illustrate historical stereotypes, boys tended to focus upon male figures exclusively while girls showed more varied family groupings.{{sfn|Fournier|Wineburg|1997|p=160-185}}

==In branding==
Using historical figures in marketing communicationsn and in branding is a new area of marketing research but historical figures‚Äô names were used to promote products as early as in the Middle Ages&lt;ref&gt;Madow M., Private Ownership of Public Image: Popular Culture and Publicity Rights, vol. 81, California Law Review 125, 1993, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Historical figure brand is using famous historical person in branding, for instance [[Mozartkugel]], [[Chopin (vodka)]] or Caf√© Einstein https://www.cafeeinstein.com/. 

Historical figure is a person who lived in the past and whose deeds exerted a significant impact on other people‚Äôs lives and consciousness. These figures are attributed with certain features that are a compilation of the actual values they proclaimed and the manner they were perceived by others. This perception evolves and subsequent generations read the biography of a given historical figure in their own way through their own knowledge and experience. In order to determine the popularity of the commercialisation of historical figures, a study was conducted at the beginning of 2014 on the number of trademark protection applications filed with the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland as a measure of entrepreneurs‚Äô interest in this activity. The names of 300 most prominent Polish historical figures &lt;ref&gt;Grygiel A.(ed.), Encyklopedia s≈Çawnych Polak√≥w, Publicat S.A., Pozna≈Ñ 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; were considered. The study showed that over 21% of the names analysed were recorded in the trademark register. 1,033 trademark protection applications were filed for 64 names out of the 300 historical figures investigated [Aldona Lipka, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Lipka Aldona, Ograniczona racjonalno≈õƒá i heurystyki w zachowaniach nabywc√≥w [w:] G. Wolska (red.), Wsp√≥≈Çczesne problemy ekonomiczne, Zeszyty Naukowe nr 858, Wyd. Uniwersytet Szczeci≈Ñski, Szczecin 2015. p. 265.(https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=8g7DDDkAAAAJ&amp;hl=pl&amp;oi=ao)&lt;/ref&gt;]. The greatest number of trademark protection applications were recorded for [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]] (295), followed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (250), [[John III Sobieski]] (94) and [[Chopin]] (81).

==In art and literature==
[[File:Henry IV 1 title page.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Shakespeare]] wrote a number of plays that dramatized the lives of historical figures, but introduced fictional characters such as [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]].]]

===Realist historical fiction===
There is a huge body of historical fiction, where the text includes both imaginary and factual elements. In early English literature, [[Robin Hood]] was a fictional character, but the historical King [[Richard I of England]] also appears.{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xviii}}
[[William Shakespeare]]{{efn|William Shakespeare was a historical figure himself, but as a biographer said, "Such materials as there are for Shakespeare's personal history, or for the history of anyone connected with him, have been gathered with the most loving and persevering industry. Unhappily, they amount to very little.  Entries in municipal records, names in a will, a lease, or an inventory, tell hardly anything of the life or character of the man.  That orange has now been squeezed dry."{{sfn|Smith|1899|p=7}}}} wrote [[List of historical figures dramatised by Shakespeare|plays about people who were historical figures in his day]], such as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. He did not present these people as pure history, but dramatised their lives as a commentary about the people and politics of his own time.{{sfn|Hattaway|2002|p=16}}
Napoleon figured in [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 classic ''[[Les Mis√©rables]]''.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=65}}
There are many more examples.

The compiler of a survey of historical novels in the 1920s claimed that the "appearance of reality ... is the great charm of the historical novel." He went on to assert, regarding novels about periods of which little is known, that "the danger is that the very elements which add to our interest in the tale as such will go far to mislead us in our conception of the period dealt with".{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xix}}
Traditionally the treatment of historical figures in fiction was realistic in style and respectful of fact. A historical novel would be true to the facts known about the period in which the novel is set, a [[biographical novel]] would follow the facts that are known about the protagonist's life, and a "[[roman √† clef]]" would try to give an accurate interpretation of what is known about a public figure's private life. In each genre, the novelist would avoid introducing any elements that were clearly in conflict with the facts.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}

A writer may be handicapped by his readers' preconceptions about a historical person, which may or may not be accurate, and the facts about the historical person may also conflict with the novelist's plot requirements.{{sfn|Lukacs|1937|p=168}}
According to the Marxist philosopher [[Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs]] in his 1937 book on ''The Historical Novel'', "The 'world-historical individual' can only figure as a minor character in the [historical] novel because of the complexity and intricacy of the whole social-historical process."{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=113}}
As Jacobs observes, the "realist aesthetic" of the historical novel "assumes that a recognizable historical figure in fiction must not 'do things' its model did not do in real life; it follows that historical figures can be used only in very limited ways."{{sfn|Wyile|2002|p=16}}
The author of a traditional historical novel should therefore focus more on the people who have been lost to history.{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=112}}
A novelist such as Sir [[Walter Scott]] or [[Leo Tolstoy]] (''[[War and Peace]]'') would describe historical events accurately. They would give rein to their imagination only in scenes that were not significant historically, when interactions with fictional characters could safely be introduced.{{sfn|Wachtel|1995|p=114}}

===Modern fiction===
More recently, however, starting with works such as ''[[The Confessions of Nat Turner]]'', and ''[[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]'' by [[William Styron]],
the novelist has felt more free to introduce much larger amounts of purely imaginary detail about historical people.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}
[[E. L. Doctorow]] illustrates this different attitude when discussing his book ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'': "Certain details were so delicious that I was scrupulous about getting them right. Others&amp;nbsp;... demanded to be mythologized."  This reflects a changing attitude about the distinction between "fact" and "truth", expressed by [[Ursule Molinaro]] when he makes his [[Cassandra]] say, "I've come as close to the truth as facts would let me ... facts oppress the truth, which can breathe freely only in poetry &amp; art."{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xvii}}

===Other media===
Many films have depicted historical figures.  Often the way in which the films interpret these figures and their times reflects the social and cultural values of the period in which the film was made.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=1}}
Historical figures are familiar to the general reader and so may be used in [[speculative fiction]] so that readers marvel at their appearance in novel settings or with a fresh perspective.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=111ff}}
For example, the time traveler [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] has encountered numerous historical figures such as [[Marco Polo]] and [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in his adventures.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gee|2012}}
They appeared most frequently when the television series first started, as it was directed at children and the use of historical figures in historical settings was intended to be educational.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=19}}

The '''history of genetics''' dates from the [[classical era]] with contributions by [[Hippocrates]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Epicurus]]. Modern biology began with the work of the [[Augustinian friar]] [[Gregor Johann Mendel]]. [[Experiments on Plant Hybridization|His work]] on pea plants, published in 1866,what is now [[Mendelian inheritance]]. Some theories of [[heredity]] suggest in the centuries before and for several decades after Mendel's work.
 
The year 1900 marked the "rediscovery of Mendel" by [[Hugo de Vries]], [[Carl Correns]] and [[Erich von Tschermak]], and by 1915 the basic principles of Mendelian [[genetics]] had been applied to a wide variety of organisms‚Äîmost notably the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.  Led by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and his fellow "drosophilists", geneticists developed the [[Mendelian]] model, which was widely accepted by 1925.  Alongside experimental work, mathematicians developed the statistical framework of [[population genetics]], bringing genetic explanations into the study of [[evolution]].

With the basic patterns of genetic inheritance established, many biologists turned to investigations of the physical nature of the [[gene]].  In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to [[DNA]] as the portion of chromosomes (and perhaps other nucleoproteins) that held genes.  A focus on new model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of [[molecular genetics]].

In the following years, chemists developed techniques for sequencing both nucleic acids and proteins, while others worked out the relationship between the two forms of biological molecules: the [[genetic code]].  The regulation of [[gene expression]] became a central issue in the 1960s; by the 1970s gene expression could be controlled and manipulated through [[genetic engineering]].  In the last decades of the 20th century, many biologists focused on large-scale genetics projects, sequencing entire genomes.

==Pre-Mendelian ideas on heredity==
{{See also|Heredity}}

===Ancient theories===
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|left|300px|[[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle's model]] of transmission of movements from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|form]] from the father. The model is not fully symmetric.&lt;ref name=LeroiAristotle&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |editor=F√∂llinger, S. |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=Function and Constraint in Aristotle and Evolutionary Theory |work=Was ist 'Leben'?

The most influential early theories of heredity were that of [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]].  Hippocrates' theory (possibly based on the teachings of [[Anaxagoras]]) was similar to Darwin's later ideas on [[pangenesis]], involving heredity material that collects from throughout the body. [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle suggested]] instead that the (nonphysical) [[Theory of forms|form-giving principle]] of an organism was transmitted through semen (which he considered to be a purified form of blood) and the mother's menstrual blood, which interacted in the womb to direct an organism's early development.&lt;ref name=LeroiAristotle/&gt;  For both Hippocrates and Aristotle‚Äîand nearly all Western scholars through to the late 19th century‚Äîthe [[inheritance of acquired characters]] was a supposedly well-established fact that any adequate theory of heredity had to explain.  At the same time, individual species were taken to have a [[essentialism|fixed essence]]; such inherited changes were merely superficial.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 635-640&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenian philosopher [[Epicurus]] observed families and proposed the contribution of both males and females of hereditary characters ("sperm atoms"), noticed dominant and recessive types of inheritance and described segregation and independent assortment of "sperm atoms"&lt;ref&gt;Yapijakis C. (2017) Ancestral Concepts of Human Genetics and Molecular Medicine in Epicurean Philosophy. In: Petermann H., Harper P., Doetz S. (eds) History of Human Genetics. Springer, Cham&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Charaka Samhita]] of 300CE, ancient Indian medical writers saw the characteristics of the child as determined by four factors: 1) those from the mother‚Äôs reproductive material, (2) those from the father‚Äôs sperm, (3) those from the diet of the pregnant mother and (4) those accompanying the soul which enters into the foetus. Each of these four factors had [[MahƒÅbh≈´ta|four parts]] creating sixteen factors of which the [[karma]] of the parents and the soul determined which attributes predominated and thereby gave the child its characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhagwan|first1=Bhagwan|last2=Sharma|first2=R.K.|title=Charaka Samhita|date=January 1, 2009|publisher=Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series|isbn=978-8170800125|pages=sharirasthanam II.26‚Äì27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century CE, the [[Afro-Arab]] writer [[Al-Jahiz]] considered the effects of the [[Natural environment|environment]] on the likelihood of an animal to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zirkle | first1=Conway | name-list-format =vanc | date=1941 | title=Natural Selection before the "Origin of Species" | jstor=984852 | journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume=84 | issue=1| pages=71‚Äì123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1000 CE, the [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arab physician]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (known as Albucasis in the West) was the first physician to describe clearly the hereditary nature of [[haemophilia]] in his ''[[Al-Tasrif]]''.&lt;ref name="MedievalLife"&gt;{{cite book | title=Handbook to life in the medieval world | first1=Madeleine Pelner | last1=Cosman | first2=Linda Gale | last2=Jones | publisher=Infobase Publishing | isbn=0-8160-4887-8 | pages=528‚Äì529}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1140 CE, [[Judah Halevi|Judah HaLevi]] described dominant and recessive genetic traits in [[The Kuzari]].&lt;ref&gt;HaLevi, Judah, translated and annotated by N. Daniel Korobkin. ''The Kuzari: In Defense of the Despised Faith, ''p. 38, I:95: "This phenomenon is common in genetics as well‚Äîoften we find a son who does not resemble his father at all, but closely resembles his grandfather. Undoubtedly, the genetics and resemblance were dormant within the father even though they were not outwardly apparent. Hebrew by [[Judah ibn Tibbon|Ibn Tibon]], p.375: ◊ï◊†◊®◊ê◊î ◊õ◊ñ◊î ◊ë◊¢◊†◊ô◊ü ◊î◊ò◊ë◊¢◊ô, ◊õ◊ô ◊õ◊û◊î ◊ô◊© ◊û◊ë◊†◊ô ◊î◊ê◊ì◊ù ◊©◊ê◊ô◊†◊ï ◊ì◊ï◊û◊î ◊ú◊ê◊ë ◊õ◊ú◊ú ◊ê◊ö ◊î◊ï◊ê ◊ì◊ï◊û◊î ◊ú◊ê◊ë◊ô ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ï ◊ï◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊°◊§◊ß ◊õ◊ô ◊î◊ò◊ë◊¢ ◊î◊î◊ï◊ê ◊ï◊î◊ì◊û◊ô◊ï◊ü ◊î◊î◊ï◊ê ◊î◊ô◊î ◊¶◊§◊ï◊ü ◊ë◊ê◊ë ◊ï◊ê◊£ ◊¢◊ú ◊§◊ô ◊©◊ú◊ê ◊†◊®◊ê◊î ◊ú◊î◊®◊í◊©◊î&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant systematics and hybridization===
{{See also|History of plant systematics}}
In the 18th century, with increased knowledge of plant and animal diversity and the accompanying increased focus on [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], new ideas about heredity began to appear.  [[Linnaeus]] and others (among them [[Joseph Gottlieb K√∂lreuter]], [[Carl Friedrich von G√§rtner]], and [[Charles Naudin]]) conducted extensive experiments with hybridization, especially species [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]].  Species hybridizers described a wide variety of inheritance phenomena, include hybrid sterility and the high variability of [[back-crossing|back-crosses]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 640-649&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant breeders were also developing an array of stable [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] in many important plant species.  In the early 19th century, [[Augustin Sageret]] established the concept of [[Dominance relationship|dominance]], recognizing that when some plant varieties are crossed, certain characteristics (present in one parent) usually appear in the offspring; he also found that some ancestral characteristics found in neither parent may appear in offspring.  However, plant breeders made little attempt to establish a theoretical foundation for their work or to share their knowledge with current work of physiology,&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 649-651&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] in England explained their system.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Explanatory Notes, Gartons Seed Catalogue for Spring 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mendel==
[[File:Blending Inheritance.svg|thumb|[[Blending inheritance]] leads to the averaging out of every characteristic, which would make [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] impossible.]]

In breeding experiments between 1856 and 1865, [[Gregor Mendel]] first traced inheritance patterns of certain traits in pea plants and showed that they obeyed simple statistical rules with some traits being dominant and others being recessive. These patterns of [[Mendelian inheritance]] demonstrated that application of statistics to inheritance could be highly useful; they also contradicted 19th century theories of [[blending inheritance]] as the traits remained discrete through multiple generation of hybridization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siddhartha Mukherjee|Mukherjee, Siddartha]] (2016) The Gene:An intimate history Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

From his statistical analysis Mendel defined a concept that he described as a character (which in his mind holds also  for "determinant of that character"). In only one sentence of his historical paper he used  the term "factors"  to designate the "material creating" the character: " So far as experience goes, we find it in every case confirmed that constant progeny can only be formed when the egg cells and the fertilizing pollen are of like character, so that both are provided with the material for creating quite similar individuals, as is the case with the normal fertilization of pure species. We must therefore regard it as certain that exactly similar factors must be at work also in the production of the constant forms in the hybrid plants."(Mendel, 1866).

Mendel's work was published in 1866 as ''"Versuche √ºber Pflanzen-Hybriden" ([[Experiments on Plant Hybridization]])'' in the ''Verhandlungen des Naturforschenden Vereins zu Br√ºnn (Proceedings of the Natural History Society of Br√ºnn)'', following two lectures he gave on the work in early 1866.

==Post-Mendel, pre-rediscovery==

===Pangenesis===
[[File:Darwin's Pangenesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Diagram of [[Charles Darwin]]'s pangenesis theory. Every part of the body emits tiny particles, [[Gemmule (pangenesis)|gemmules]], which migrate to the [[gonad]]s and contribute to the fertilised egg and so to the next generation. The theory implied that changes to the body during an organism's life would be inherited, as proposed in [[Lamarckism]].]]

Mendel's work was published in a relatively obscure [[scientific journal]], and it was not given any attention in the scientific community. Instead, discussions about modes of heredity were galvanized by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by natural selection, in which mechanisms of non-[[Lamarckian]] heredity seemed to be required. Darwin's own theory of heredity, [[pangenesis]], did not meet with any large degree of acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, C. R.]] (1871).

===Germ plasm===
[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[August Weismann]]'s germ plasm theory. The hereditary material, the germ plasm, is confined to the [[gonad]]s. Somatic cells (of the body) [[embryology|develop afresh]] in each generation from the germ plasm.]]

In 1883 [[August Weismann]] conducted experiments involving breeding mice whose tails had been surgically removed. His results ‚Äî that surgically removing a mouse's tail had no effect on the tail of its offspring ‚Äî challenged the theories of pangenesis and [[Lamarckism]], which held that changes to an organism during its lifetime could be inherited by its descendants. Weismann proposed the [[germ plasm]] theory of inheritance, which held that hereditary information was carried only in sperm and egg cells.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee_ch5"&gt;[[Siddhartha Mukherjee|Mukherjee, Siddartha]] (2016) The Gene:An intimate history Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery of Mendel==

[[Hugo de Vries]] wondered what the nature of germ plasm might be, and in particular he wondered whether or not germ plasm was mixed like paint or whether the information was carried in discrete packets that remained unbroken. In the 1890s he was conducting breeding experiments with a variety of plant species and in 1897 he published a paper on his results that stated that each inherited trait was governed by two discrete particles of information, one from each parent, and that these particles were passed along intact to the next generation. In 1900 he was preparing another paper on his further results when he was shown a copy of Mendel's 1866 paper by a friend who thought it might be relevant to de Vries's work. He went ahead and published his 1900 paper without mentioning Mendel's priority. Later that same year another botanist, [[Carl Correns]], who had been conducting hybridization experiments with maize and peas, was searching the literature for related experiments prior to publishing his own results when he came across Mendel's paper, which had results similar to his own. Correns accused de Vries of appropriating terminology from Mendel's paper without crediting him or recognizing his priority. At the same time another botanist, [[Erich von Tschermak]] was experimenting with pea breeding and producing results like Mendel's. He too discovered Mendel's paper while searching the literature for relevant work. In a subsequent paper de Vries praised Mendel and acknowledged that he had only extended his earlier work.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee_ch5"/&gt;

==Emergence of molecular genetics==
After the rediscovery of Mendel's work there was a feud between [[William Bateson]] and [[Karl Pearson|Pearson]] over the hereditary mechanism, solved by [[Ronald Fisher]] in his work "[[The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]".

[[File:Sexlinked inheritance white.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] discovered [[sex linked]] inheritance of the white eyed mutation in the  fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosophila]]'' in 1910, implying the [[gene]] was on the [[sex chromosome]].]]

In 1910, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] showed that genes reside on specific [[chromosome]]s. He later showed that genes occupy specific locations on the chromosome. With this knowledge, Morgan and his students began the first chromosomal map of the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''. In 1928, [[Frederick Griffith]] showed that genes could be transferred. In what is now known as [[Griffith's experiment]], injections into a mouse of a deadly strain of [[bacteria]] that had been heat-killed transferred genetic information to a safe strain of the same bacteria, killing the mouse.

A series of subsequent discoveries led to the realization decades later that the genetic material is made of [[DNA]] (deoxyribonucleic acid). In 1941, [[George Wells Beadle]] and [[Edward Lawrie Tatum]] showed that mutations in genes caused errors in specific steps in [[metabolic pathway]]s. This showed that specific genes code for specific proteins, leading to the "[[one gene, one enzyme]]" hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Gerstein"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Gerstein MB, Bruce C, Rozowsky JS, Zheng D, Du J, Korbel JO, Emanuelsson O, Zhang ZD, Weissman S, Snyder M | title=What is a gene, post-ENCODE?

Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] demonstrated the molecular structure of [[DNA]]. Together, these discoveries established the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], which states that proteins are translated from [[RNA]] which is transcribed by DNA. This dogma has since been shown to have exceptions, such as [[reverse transcription]] in [[retrovirus]]es.

In 1972, [[Walter Fiers]] and his team at the [[University of Ghent]] were the first to determine the sequence of a gene: the gene for [[bacteriophage MS2]] coat protein.&lt;ref name=Min_1972&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Min Jou W, Haegeman G, Ysebaert M, Fiers W | title=Nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein | journal=Nature | volume=237 | issue=5350 | pages=82‚Äì8 | date=May 1972 | pmid=4555447 | doi=10.1038/237082a0 | bibcode=1972Natur.237...82J }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard J. Roberts]] and [[Phillip Sharp]] discovered in 1977 that genes can be split into segments. This led to the idea that one gene can make several proteins. The successful sequencing of many organisms' [[genome]]s has complicated the molecular definition of the gene. In particular, genes do not always sit side by side on [[DNA]] like discrete beads. Instead, [[region]]s of the DNA producing distinct proteins may overlap, so that the idea emerges that "genes are one long [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]".&lt;ref name=Pearson_2006&gt;{{cite journal | author=Pearson, H. | title=Genetics: what is a gene? | journal=Nature | volume=441 | issue=7092 | pages=398‚Äì401 | date=May 2006 | pmid=16724031 | doi=10.1038/441398a | bibcode=2006Natur.441..398P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rethink"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Pennisi E | title=Genomics.

==Early timeline==

:1856-1863: Mendel studied the inheritance of [[Trait (biology)|traits]] between generations based on experiments involving garden pea plants. He deduced that there is a certain tangible essence that is passed on between generations from both parents. Mendel established the basic [[Mendelian inheritance|principles of inheritance]], namely, the [[Dominance (genetics)|principles of dominance]], [[Mendelian inheritance#Law of Independent Assortment .28The .22Second Law.22.29|independent assortment]], and [[Mendelian inheritance#Law of Segregation|segregation]].
:1866: Austrian Augustinian monk [[Gregor Mendel]]'s paper, ''[[Experiments on Plant Hybridization]]'', published.
:1869: [[Friedrich Miescher]] discovers a weak acid in the nuclei of [[white blood cell]]s that today we call [[DNA]]. In 1871 he isolated cell nuclei, separated the nucleic cells from bandages and then treated them with [[pepsin]] (an enzyme which breaks down proteins). From this, he recovered an acidic substance which he called "[[nuclein]]."&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Genetics / D. Peter Snustad, Michael J. Simmons ‚Äì 5th Ed. pp.210&lt;/ref&gt;
:1880-1890: [[Walther Flemming]], [[Eduard Strasburger]], and [[Edouard Van Beneden]] elucidate chromosome distribution during [[cell division]]
:1889: [[Richard Altmann]] purified protein free [[DNA]]. However, the [[nucleic acid]] was not as pure as he had assumed. It was determined later to contain a large amount of protein.
:1889: [[Hugo de Vries]] postulates that "inheritance of specific traits in organisms comes in particles", naming such particles "(pan)genes"&lt;ref name="pangen"&gt;Vries, H. de (1889) ''Intracellular Pangenesis'' [http://www.esp.org/books/devries/pangenesis/facsimile/] ("pan-gene" definition on page 7 and 40 of this 1910 translation in English)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''homeobox''' is a [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]], around 180 [[base pair]]s long, found within [[gene]]s that are involved in the regulation of patterns of anatomical development ([[morphogenesis]]) in [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[plant]]s.

[[Homeosis]] is a term coined by [[William Bateson]] to describe the outright replacement of a discrete body part with another body part. Homeobox genes are not only found in animals, but have also been found in [[fungus|fungi]], for example the [[microorganism|unicellular]] [[yeast]]s, in plants, and numerous single cell eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid26464018"/&gt;

Scott]] and Amy Weiner, who were then working with [[Thomas Kaufman]] at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]].&lt;ref name="pmid6323992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGinnis W, Levine MS, Hafen E, Kuroiwa A, Gehring WJ | title = A conserved DNA sequence in homoeotic genes of the Drosophila Antennapedia and bithorax complexes | journal = Nature | volume = 308 | issue = 5958 | pages = 428‚Äì33 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6323992 | doi = 10.1038/308428a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid6330741"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scott MP, Weiner AJ | title = Structural relationships among genes that control development: sequence homology between the Antennapedia, Ultrabithorax, and fushi tarazu loci of Drosophila | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 81 | issue = 13 | pages = 4115‚Äì9 | date = Jul 1984 | pmid = 6330741 | pmc = 345379 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.81.13.4115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of homeobox genes were first discovered in ''[[Drosophila]]'', where mutations in homeobox genes caused the radical alterations known as "[[homeosis|homeotic]] transformations". One of the most famous such mutation is ''[[antennapedia]]'', in which legs grow from the head of a fly instead of the expected antennae.

== Homeodomain proteins ==
A homeobox is about 180 DNA [[base pair]]s long and encodes a [[protein domain]] that binds [[DNA]]. The following shows the [[consensus sequence|consensus]] homeodomain (~60 amino acid residue chain):&lt;ref name="urlwww.csb.ki.se"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csb.ki.se/groups/tbu/homeo/consensus.gif | title = The homeobox page| format = gif | author = B√ºrglin  TR | publisher = Karolinksa Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===

The characteristic homeodomain [[protein fold]] consists of a 60-[[amino acid]] long domain composed of three alpha helixes. Helix 2 and helix 3 form a so-called [[helix-turn-helix]] (HTH) structure, where the two [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] are connected by a short loop region. The [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] two helices of the homeodomain are [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] and the longer [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] helix is roughly perpendicular to the axes established by the first two. It is this third helix that interacts directly with [[DNA]] via a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, as well as indirect interactions via water molecules, which occur between specific [[side chain]]s and the exposed [[nucleotide|base]]s within the [[major groove]] of the DNA.&lt;ref name="PUB00005540" /&gt;

Homeodomain proteins are found in [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid26464018"/&gt; Through the HTH motif, they share limited sequence similarity and structural similarity to  prokaryotic transcription factors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathdb.info/version/v4_0_0/superfamily/1.10.10.60|title=CATH Superfamily 1.10.10.60|author=|date=|website=www.cathdb.info|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[lambda phage]] proteins that alter the expression of genes in [[prokaryote]]s. The HTH motif shows some sequence similarity but a similar structure in a wide range of DNA-binding proteins (e.g., [[Lambda phage#Protein function overview|cro]] and [[repressor protein]]s, homeodomain proteins, etc.). One of the principal differences between HTH motifs in these different proteins arises from the stereo-chemical requirement for [[glycine]] in the turn which is needed to avoid [[steric]] interference of the beta-carbon with the main chain: for cro and repressor proteins the glycine appears to be mandatory, whereas for many of the homeotic and other DNA-binding proteins the requirement is relaxed.

===Sequence specificity===

Homeodomains can bind both specifically and nonspecifically to [[B-DNA]] with the C-terminal recognition helix aligning in the DNA's major groove and the unstructured peptide "tail" at the N-terminus aligning in the minor groove. The recognition helix and the inter-helix loops are rich in [[arginine]] and [[lysine]] residues, which form [[hydrogen bond]]s to the DNA backbone; [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] [[hydrophobic]] residues in the center of the recognition helix aid in stabilizing the helix packing. Homeodomain proteins show a preference for the DNA sequence 5'-TAAT-3'; sequence-independent binding occurs with significantly lower affinity.

===Biological function===

Through the DNA-recognition properties of the homeodomain, homeoproteins are believed to regulate the expression of targeted genes and direct the formation of many body structures during early embryonic development.&lt;ref name="pmid1357628"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corsetti MT, Briata P, Sanseverino L, Daga A, Airoldi I, Simeone A, Palmisano G, Angelini C, Boncinelli E, Corte G | title = Differential DNA binding properties of three human homeodomain proteins | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 20 | issue = 17 | pages = 4465‚Äì72 | date = Sep 1992 | pmid = 1357628 | pmc = 334173 | doi = 10.1093/nar/20.17.4465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many homeodomain proteins induce [[cellular differentiation]] by initiating the cascades of coregulated genes required to produce individual [[biological tissue|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s. Other proteins in the family, such as [[Homeobox protein NANOG|NANOG]] are involved in maintaining [[pluripotency]]. Homeobox genes are critical in the establishment of body axes during [[embryogenesis]].

Homeoprotein transcription factors typically switch on cascades of other genes. The homeodomain binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner. However, the specificity of a single homeodomain protein is usually not enough to recognize only its desired target genes. Most of the time, homeodomain proteins act in the [[promoter (biology)|promoter region]] of their target genes as complexes with other transcription factors. Such complexes have a much higher target specificity than a single homeodomain protein. Homeodomains are encoded both by genes of the [[Hox gene|Hox gene clusters]] and by other genes throughout the genome.

The homeobox domain was first identified in a number of ''Drosophila'' [[Homeosis|homeotic]] and segmentation proteins, but is now known to be well-conserved in many other animals, including [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref name="PUB00005390"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PUB00005540"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schofield PN |title=Patterns, puzzles and paradigms - The riddle of the homeobox |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=10 |issue= |pages=3‚Äì6 |year=1987 |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(87)90113-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PUB00000591"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scott MP, Tamkun JW, Hartzell GW | title = The structure and function of the homeodomain | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 989 | issue = 1 | pages = 25‚Äì48 | date = Jul 1989 | pmid = 2568852 | doi = 10.1016/0304-419x(89)90033-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant homeobox genes ==
As in animals, the plant homeobox genes code for the typical 60 amino acid long DNA-binding homeodomain or in case of the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) homeobox genes for an "atypical" homeodomain consisting of 63 amino acids. According to their conserved intron‚Äìexon structure and to unique codomain architectures they have been grouped into 14 distinct classes: HD-ZIP I to IV, BEL, KNOX, PLINC, WOX, PHD, DDT, NDX, LD, SAWADEE and PINTOX.&lt;ref name="pmid19734295"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mukherjee K, Brocchieri L, B√ºrglin TR | title = A comprehensive classification and evolutionary analysis of plant homeobox genes | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 26 | issue = 12 | pages = 2775‚Äì94 | date = Dec 2009 | pmid = 19734295 | pmc = 2775110 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msp201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation of codomains suggests a common eukaryotic ancestry for TALE&lt;ref name="pmid9336443"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = B√ºrglin TR | title = Analysis of TALE superclass homeobox genes (MEIS, PBC, KNOX, Iroquois, TGIF) reveals a novel domain conserved between plants and animals | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 25 | issue = 21 | pages = 4173‚Äì80 | date = Nov 1997 | pmid = 9336443 | pmc = 147054 | doi =  10.1093/nar/25.21.4173}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-TALE homeodomain proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid17501745"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Derelle R, Lopez P, Le Guyader H, Manuel M | title = Homeodomain proteins belong to the ancestral molecular toolkit of eukaryotes | journal = Evolution &amp; Development | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 212‚Äì9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17501745 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-142X.2007.00153.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==POU genes==
{{further|POU family}}
Proteins containing a POU region consist of a homeodomain and a separate, [[structurally homologous]] POU domain that contains two [[helix-turn-helix]] motifs and also binds DNA. The two domains are linked by a flexible loop that is long enough to stretch around the DNA helix, allowing the two domains to bind on opposite sides of the target DNA, collectively covering an eight-base segment with [[consensus sequence]] 5'-ATGCAAAT-3'. The individual domains of POU proteins bind DNA only weakly, but have strong sequence-specific affinity when linked. The POU domain itself has significant structural similarity with repressors expressed in [[bacteriophage]]s, particularly [[lambda phage]].

In humans, the POU genes are [[HDX (gene)|HDX]]; [[POU1F1]]; [[POU2F1]]; [[POU2F2]]; [[POU2F3]]; [[POU3F1]]; [[POU3F2]]; [[POU3F3]]; [[POU3F4]]; [[POU4F1]]; [[POU4F2]]; [[POU4F3]]; [[POU5F1]]; [[POU5F1P1]]; [[POU5F1P4]]; [[POU5F2]]; [[POU6F1]]; and [[POU6F2]].

{{Main article|Hox gene}}

Hox genes are a subset of homeobox genes. They are essential [[metazoa]]n genes as they determine the identity of embryonic regions along the anterio-posterior axis.&lt;ref name="pmid12445403"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alonso CR | title = Hox proteins: sculpting body parts by activating localized cell death | journal = Current Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 22 | pages = R776-8 | date = Nov 2002 | pmid = 12445403 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(02)01291-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first vertebrate Hox gene was isolated in ''[[Xenopus]]'' by Eddy De Robertis and colleagues in 1984, marking the beginning of the young science of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] ("evo-devo").&lt;ref name="pmid6327066"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrasco AE, McGinnis W, Gehring WJ, De Robertis EM | title = Cloning of an X. laevis gene expressed during early embryogenesis coding for a peptide region homologous to Drosophila homeotic genes | journal = Cell | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 409‚Äì14 | date = Jun 1984 | pmid = 6327066 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(84)90371-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutations in these [[homeotic gene]]s cause displacement of organs.

In vertebrates, the four [[homology (biology)|paralog]] clusters are partially redundant in function, but have also acquired several derived functions. In particular, HoxA and HoxD specify segment identity along the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] axis.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The main interest in this set of genes stems from their unique behaviour. They are typically found in an organized cluster. The linear order of the genes within a cluster is directly correlated to the order of the regions they affect as well as the timing in which they are affected. This phenomenon is called colinearity. Due to this linear relationship, changes in the gene cluster due to mutations generally result in similar changes in the affected regions.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

For example, when one gene is lost the segment develops into a more anterior one, while a mutation that leads to a gain of function causes a segment to develop into a more posterior one. This is called [[Ectopic expression|ectopia]]. Famous examples are [[Antennapedia]] and [[Bithorax complex|bithorax]] in ''Drosophila'', which can cause the development of legs instead of antennae and the development of a duplicated thorax, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Molecular evidence shows that some limited number of Hox genes have existed in the [[Cnidaria]] since before the earliest true [[Bilateria|Bilatera]], making these genes pre-[[Paleozoic]].&lt;ref name="pmid17252055"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryan JF, Mazza ME, Pang K, Matus DQ, Baxevanis AD, Martindale MQ, Finnerty JR | title = Pre-bilaterian origins of the Hox cluster and the Hox code: evidence from the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = e153 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17252055 | pmc = 1779807 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ParaHox]] genes are analogously found in four areas. They include [[CDX1]], [[CDX2]], [[Cdx protein family|CDX4]]; [[GSX1]], [[GSX2]]; and [[PDX1]]. Other genes considered Hox-like include [[Evx1|EVX1]], [[EVX2]]; [[GBX1]], [[GBX2]]; [[MEOX1]], [[MEOX2]]; and [[MNX1]]. The NK-like (NKL) genes, some of which are considered "MetaHox", are grouped with Hox-like genes into a large ANTP-like group.&lt;ref name=pmc2211742/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coulier |first1=Fran√ßois |last2=Popovici |first2=Cornel |last3=Villet |first3=R√©gis |last4=Birnbaum |first4=Daniel |title=MetaHox gene clusters |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |date=15 December 2000 |volume=288 |issue=4 |pages=345‚Äì351 |doi=10.1002/1097-010X(20001215)288:4&lt;345::AID-JEZ7&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mutations ==
Mutations to homeobox genes can produce easily visible [[phenotype|phenotypic]] changes.

Two examples of homeobox mutations in the above-mentioned fruit fly are legs where the antennae should be ([[antennapedia]]), and a second pair of wings.

Duplication of homeobox genes can produce new body segments, and such duplications are likely to have been important in the [[evolution]] of segmented animals. However, Hox genes typically determine the identity of body segments.

There is one [[insect]] family, the [[Xyelidae|xyelid sawflies]], in which both the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] and mouthparts are remarkably leg-like in structure. This is not uncommon in arthropods as all arthropod appendages are homologous.

== Regulation ==
Hox genes and their associated microRNAs are highly conserved developmental master regulators with tight tissue-specific, spatiotemporal control. These genes are known to be dysregulated in several cancers and are often controlled by DNA methylation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24996520"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatlekar S, Fields JZ, Boman BM | title = HOX genes and their role in the development of human cancers | journal = Journal of Molecular Medicine | volume = 92 | issue = 8 | pages = 811‚Äì23 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 24996520 | doi = 10.1007/s00109-014-1181-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation of Hox genes is highly complex and involves reciprocal interactions, mostly inhibitory. [[Drosophila]] is known to use the [[Polycomb-group proteins|Polycomb]] and [[Trithorax]] Complexes to maintain the expression of Hox genes after the down-regulation of the pair-rule and gap genes that occurs during larval development. [[Polycomb-group proteins]] can silence the HOX genes by modulation of [[chromatin]] structure.&lt;ref name="Portoso"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg | vauthors = Portoso M, Cavalli G | year = 2008 | chapter = The Role of RNAi and Noncoding RNAs in Polycomb Mediated Control of Gene Expression and Genomic Programming | title = RNA and the Regulation of Gene Expression: A Hidden Layer of Complexity | publisher = Caister Academic Press | url = http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg | isbn = 978-1-904455-25-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary Origin ==
The homeobox itself may have evolved from a non-DNA-binding transmembrane domain at the C-terminus of the MraY enzyme. This is based on metagenomic data  acquired from the transitional archaeon, Lokiarchaeum, that is regarded as the prokaryote closest to the ancestor of all eukaryotes. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328511976_The_origin_of_the_Homeobox_at_the_C-terminus_of_MraY_in_Lokiarchaea&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Idempotence''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|,|…™|d|…õ|m|Àà|p|…ô ä|t|…ôn|s}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=idempotence |dictionary=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/273873 |date=2010 |edition= 3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|Àå|a…™|d|…ô|m|-}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=idempotent |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idempotent |dictionary=[[Merriam-Webster]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019143953/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idempotent |archivedate=2016-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the property of certain [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. The concept of idempotence arises in a number of places in [[abstract algebra]] (in particular, in the theory of [[projector (linear algebra)|projector]]s and [[closure operator]]s) and [[functional programming]] (in which it is connected to the property of [[Referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]]).

The term was introduced by [[Benjamin Peirce]]&lt;ref&gt;Polcino &amp; Sehgal (2002), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of elements of algebras that remain invariant when raised to a positive integer power, and literally means "(the quality of having) the same power", from {{wikt-lang|la|idem}} + ''[[wikt:potence|potence]]'' (same + power).

== Definition ==
An element ''x'' of a [[Magma (algebra)|magma]] (''M'', ‚Ä¢) is said to be ''idempotent'' if:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Valenza |first=Robert |date=2012 |title=Linear Algebra: An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7x8MCAAAQBAJ |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |page=22 |isbn=9781461209010 |quote=An element ''s'' of a magma such that ''ss'' = ''s'' is called ''idempotent''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Doneddu |first=Alfred |date=1976 |title=Polyn√¥mes et alg√®bre lin√©aire |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=5Ry7AAAAIAAJ |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=Vuibert |page=180 |isbn=|quote=Soit ''M'' un magma, not√© multiplicativement. On nomme idempotent de ''M'' tout √©l√©ment ''a'' de ''M'' tel que ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{nowrap|1=''x'' ‚Ä¢ ''x'' = ''x''}}.
If all elements are idempotent with respect to ‚Ä¢, then ‚Ä¢ is called idempotent.
The formula ‚àÄ''x'', {{nowrap|1=''x'' ‚Ä¢ ''x'' = ''x''}} is called the idempotency law for ‚Ä¢.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=George Gr√§tzer | title=General Lattice Theory | location=Basel | publisher=Birkh√§user | year=2003 }} Here: Sect.1.2, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Garrett Birkhoff | title=Lattice Theory | location=Providence | publisher=Am. Math. Soc. | series=Colloquium Publications | volume=25 | year=1967 }}. Here: Sect.I.5, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* The natural number 1 is an idempotent element with respect to [[multiplication]] (since 1[[multiplication|√ó]]1 = 1), and so is 0 (since 0√ó0=0), but no other natural number is (e.g. 2√ó2=2 does not hold). For the latter reason, multiplication of natural numbers is ''not'' an idempotent operation. More formally, in the [[monoid]] ([[Natural number|‚Ñï]], √ó), idempotent elements are just 0 and 1.
* In a magma (''M'', ‚Ä¢), an [[identity element]] ''e'' or an [[absorbing element]] ''a'', if it exists, is idempotent. Indeed, {{nowrap|1=''e'' ‚Ä¢ ''e'' = ''e''}} and {{nowrap|1=''a'' ‚Ä¢ ''a'' = ''a''}}.
* In a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] (''G'', ‚Ä¢), the identity element ''e'' is the only idempotent element. Indeed, if ''x'' is an element of ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x'' ‚Ä¢ ''x'' = ''x''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''x'' ‚Ä¢ ''x'' = ''x'' ‚Ä¢ ''e''}} and finally ''x'' = ''e'' by multiplying on the left by the [[inverse element]] of ''x''.

* Taking the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] ''x''[[intersection (set theory)|‚à©]]''y'' of two sets ''x'' and ''y'' is an idempotent operation, since ''x''‚à©''x'' always equals ''x''. This means that the idempotency law ‚àÄ''x'', ''x''‚à©''x'' = ''x'' is true. Similarly, taking the union of two sets is an idempotent operation. Formally, in the monoids (ùí´(''E''), ‚à™) and (ùí´(''E''), ‚à©) of the [[power set]] of the set ''E'' with the [[Union (set theory)|set union]] ‚à™ and [[Intersection (set theory)|set intersection]] ‚à© respectively, all elements are idempotent; hence ‚à™ and ‚à© are idempotent operations on ùí´(''E'').
* In the monoids ({0, 1}, ‚à®) and ({0, 1}, ‚àß) of the [[Boolean domain]] with the [[logical disjunction]] ‚à® and the  [[logical conjunction]] ‚àß respectively, all elements are idempotent.

===Idempotent functions===
In the monoid (''F&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;'', ‚àò) of the [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from a set ''E'' to a [[subset]] ''F'' of ''E'' with the [[function composition]] ‚àò, idempotent elements are the functions {{nowrap|''f'': ''E'' ‚Üí ''F''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f'' ‚àò ''f'' = ''f''}}, in other words such that for all ''x'' in ''E'', {{nowrap|1=''f''(''f''(''x'')) = ''f''(''x'')}} (the image of each element in ''E'' is a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of ''f''). For example:
* Taking the [[absolute value]] ''abs''(''x'')&lt;ref&gt;A more common notation for this is &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt;, however, it is harder to read when expressions are nested.&lt;/ref&gt; of an [[integer number]] ''x'' is an idempotent function for the following reason: ''abs''(''abs''(''x'')) = ''abs''(''x'') is true for each integer number ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, this equation holds for all [[rational number|rational]], [[real number|real]] and even [[complex number]]s, too.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that ''abs'' [[function composition|‚àò]] ''abs'' = ''abs''&lt;ref&gt;This an an equation between functions. Two functions are equal if their domains and ranges agree, and their output values agree on their whole domain.&lt;/ref&gt; holds, that is, ''abs'' is an idempotent element in the set of all functions (from integers to integers)&lt;ref&gt;This set of functions is formally denoted as [[integer number|‚Ñ§]]&lt;sup&gt;‚Ñ§&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; with respect to function composition. Therefore, ''abs'' satisfies the above definition of an idempotent function.
Other examples include:
* the [[Identity function|identity]] function is idempotent;
* [[Constant function|constant]] functions are idempotent;
* the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]], [[Floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]] and [[fractional part]] functions are idempotent;
* the [[Generating set of a group|subgroup generated]] function from the power set of a group to itself is idempotent;
* the [[convex hull]] function from the power set of an [[affine space]] over the [[Real number|reals]] to itself is idempotent;
* the [[Closure (topology)|closure]] and [[Interior (topology)|interior]] functions of the power set of a [[topological space]] to itself are idempotent;
* the [[Kleene star]] and [[Kleene plus]] functions of the power set of a monoid to itself are idempotent;
* the idempotent [[endomorphism]]s of a [[vector space]] are its [[Projection (linear algebra)|projections]].

If the set ''E'' has ''n'' elements, we can partition it into ''k'' chosen fixed points and {{nowrap|''n'' ‚àí ''k''}} non-fixed points under ''f'', and then ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''‚àí''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is the number of different idempotent functions. Hence, taking into account all possible partitions,
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} k^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;
is the total number of possible idempotent functions on the set. The [[integer sequence]] of the number of idempotent functions as given by the sum above for ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ‚Ä¶ starts  with 1, 1, 3, 10, 41, 196, 1057, 6322, 41393, ‚Ä¶ {{OEIS|A000248}}.

Neither the property of being idempotent nor that of being not is preserved under function composition.&lt;ref&gt;If ''f'' and ''g'' commute, i.e. if {{nowrap|1=''f'' ‚àò ''g'' = ''g'' ‚àò ''f''}}, then idempotency of both ''f'' and ''g'' implies that of {{nowrap|''f'' ‚àò ''g''}}, since {{nowrap|1=(''f'' ‚àò ''g'') ‚àò (''f'' ‚àò ''g'') = (''f'' ‚àò ''f'') ‚àò (''g'' ‚àò ''g'') = ''f'' ‚àò ''g''}}, using the associativity of composition.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example for the former, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''}} [[modulo arithmetic|mod]] 3 and ''g''(''x'') = max(''x'', 5) are both idempotent, but {{nowrap|''f'' ‚àò ''g''}} is not,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''f''(''g''(7)) = ''f''(7) = 1, but ''f''(''g''(1)) = ''f''(5) = 2 ‚â† 1&lt;/ref&gt; although {{nowrap|''g'' ‚àò ''f''}} happens to be.&lt;ref&gt;also showing that commutation of ''f'' and ''g'' is not a [[necessary condition]] for idempotency preservation&lt;/ref&gt; As an example for the latter, the negation function ¬¨ on the Boolean domain is not idempotent, but {{nowrap|¬¨ ‚àò ¬¨}} is. Similarly, unary negation {{nowrap|‚àí( )}} of real numbers is not idempotent, but  {{nowrap|‚àí( ) ‚àò ‚àí( )}} is.

== Computer science meaning ==
{{See also|Referential transparency (computer science)|Reentrant (subroutine)|Stable sort}}
In [[computer science]], the term ''idempotence'' may have a different meaning depending on the context in which it is applied:
* in [[imperative programming]], a [[subroutine]] with [[Side effect (computer science)|side effects]] is idempotent if the system state remains the same after one or several calls, in other words if the function from the system state space to itself associated to the subroutine is idempotent in the mathematical sense given in the [[#Definition|definition]];
* in [[functional programming]], a [[pure function]] is idempotent if it is idempotent in the mathematical sense given in the [[#Definition|definition]].

This is a very useful property in many situations, as it means that an operation can be repeated or retried as often as necessary without causing unintended effects. With non-idempotent operations, the algorithm may have to keep track of whether the operation was already performed or not.

=== Computer science examples ===
A function looking up a customer's name and address in a [[database]] is typically idempotent, since this will not cause the database to change.  Similarly, changing a customer's address is typically idempotent, because the final address will be the same no matter how many times it is submitted. However, placing an order for a car for the customer is typically not idempotent, since running the call several times will lead to several orders being placed. Canceling an order is idempotent, because the order remains canceled no matter how many requests are made.

A composition of idempotent methods or subroutines, however, is not necessarily idempotent if a later method in the sequence changes a value that an earlier method depends on ‚Äì ''idempotence is not closed under composition''.  For example, suppose the initial value of a variable is 3 and there is a sequence that reads the variable, then changes it to 5, and then reads it again.  Each step in the sequence is idempotent: both steps reading the variable have no side effects and changing a variable to 5 will always have the same effect no matter how many times it is executed.  Nonetheless, executing the entire sequence once produces the output (3, 5), but executing it a second time produces the output (5, 5), so the sequence is not idempotent.&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} please discuss this on talk page before reinstating --&gt;

In the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), idempotence and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Safe methods|safety]] are the major attributes that separate [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request methods|HTTP verbs]].  Of the major HTTP verbs, GET, PUT, and DELETE should be implemented in an idempotent manner according to the standard, but POST need not be.&lt;ref name="httpStd-methods"&gt;IETF, [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.2 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608213403/http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 |date=2014-06-08 }}.  See also [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HyperText Transfer Protocol]].&lt;/ref&gt;  GET retrieves a resource; PUT stores content at a resource; and DELETE eliminates a resource.  As in the example above, reading data usually has no side effects, so it is idempotent (in fact [[wiktionary:nullipotent|''nullipotent'']]).  Storing and deleting a given set of content are each usually idempotent as long as the request specifies a location or identifier that uniquely identifies that resource and only that resource again in the future.  The PUT and DELETE operations with unique identifiers reduce to the simple case of assignment to an immutable variable of either a value or the null-value, respectively, and are idempotent for the same reason; the end result is always the same as the result of the initial execution, even if the response differs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF|title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content |rfc=7231 |section=4.2.2 |sectionname=Idempotent Methods |quote=It knows that repeating the request will have the same intended effect, even if the original request succeeded, though the response might differ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violation of the unique identification requirement in storage or deletion typically causes violation of idempotence.  For example, storing or deleting a given set of content without specifying a unique identifier: POST requests, which do not need to be idempotent, often do not contain unique identifiers, so the creation of the identifier is delegated to the receiving system which then creates a corresponding new record.  Similarly, PUT and DELETE requests with nonspecific criteria may result in different outcomes depending on the state of the system - for example, a request to delete the most recent record. In each case, subsequent executions will further modify the state of the system, so they are not idempotent. 

In [[Event stream processing]], idempotence refers to the ability of a system to produce the same outcome, even if the same file, event or message is received more than once.

In a [[load-store architecture]], instructions that might possibly cause a [[page fault]] are idempotent. So if a page fault occurs, the OS can load the page from disk and then simply re-execute the faulted instruction.  In a processor where such instructions are not idempotent, dealing with page faults is much more complex.{{fact|date=August 2016}}

When reformatting output, [[Prettyprint|pretty-printing]] is expected to be idempotent. In other words, if the output is already "pretty", there should be nothing to do for the pretty-printer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Applied examples ==
[[File:Colecci√≥n de hombres cruzando.JPG|thumb|A typical crosswalk button is an example of an idempotent system]]
Applied examples that many people could encounter in their day-to-day lives include [[elevator]] call buttons and [[crosswalk button]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110523081716/http://www.nclabor.com/elevator/geartrac.pdf  For example, this design specification includes detailed algorithm for when elevator cars will respond to subsequent calls for service&lt;/ref&gt; The initial activation of the button moves the system into a requesting state, until the request is satisfied. Subsequent activations of the button between the initial activation and the request being satisfied have no effect, unless the system is designed to adjust the time for satisfying the request based on the number of activations.

'''Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services''' ('''INCOIS''') is an autonomous organization of the [[Government of India]], under the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences]], located in [[Pragathi Nagar]], [[Hyderabad]]. ESSO-INCOIS was established as an autonomous body in 1999 under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) and is a unit of the Earth System Science Organization (ESSO). ESSO- INCOIS is mandated to provide the best possible ocean information and advisory services to society, industry, government agencies and the scientific community through sustained ocean observations and constant improvements through systematic and focussed research.

==History==

During 90s, the Ministry of Earth Sciences, formerly Department of Ocean Development (DOD), had initiated a project titled "PFZ Mission" and it was handed over to [[National Remote Sensing Centre]] (NRSC), Hyderabad, AP. The project slowly blossomed into a full-fledged one, Due to the sincere work done by Dr. A. Narendra Nath.  As a result of this, the project was separated from NRSC and a new organization was instituted to look after it. The new organization so formed was named as an Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) and was placed under reputed scientist Dr A.Narendra Nath, Who was also the founder director for INCOIS.  Since its Inception in February 1998.   Dr. Narendra Nath is the person who initiated the PFZ  Mission.. The newly formed entity had potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories as its major project. Apart  from PFZ services, the other services such as Indian Early Tsunami Warning, Ocean State Forecast, Ocean Modeling, Data and Web Services Management were also initiated and their products are being delivered to various stakeholders in the country on a daily basis. In recognition of these services, INCOIS was identified as one of the key International Oceanic Organizations. INCOIS renders its services through its web portal and various other devices that are installed at different places in the country.

==Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ)==

This is the first advisory service started by INCOIS. The backbone of this service is the real-time data for ocean color and SST provided by the OCEANSAT and NOAA respectively. This service was started because there was a need to identify the potential fishing zones to help the fishermen to get better catch while they were at the sea. This service was started by the Ministry of Earth Sciences with the help of the Department of Space and several institutions under the Ministry of Agriculture. These organizations are collaborating with the State Governments of the beneficiary states to offer these services to the end users.

This service makes use of parameters such as sea surface temperature and chlorophyll content provided by NOAA-AVHRR and Oceancolor satellites. Features such as oceanic fronts, Meandering Patterns, Eddies, Rings, Up Welling areas etc. are identified sites for fish accumulation. These features can easily be identified from Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll data. The availability of Chlorophyll from OCEANSAT and MOdDIS has further enriched these advisories in the recent years. Hence, PFZ advisories have helped the fishing community to locate the fishing zones with accuracy.

Another feature of PFZ service is the generation of species-specific advisory to enable the fishermen folk to distinguish between the exploited and under-exploited species in the potential fishing zones. This enables them to have sustainable fishery management by targeting only the under-exploited species in the fishing zones. This approach enables them to avoid fishing the over-exploited species over and over again. One such species-specific advisory is Tuna Fisheries Forecasting System that enables the fishing community to adequately prepare for the Tuna catch. Being a highly migratory fish, it inhabits a wide range of ecosystems and wide area. Hence the fishing of tuna is a costly affair and it requires resource-specific orientation such as long lining by the fishing boats and trawlers. With the help of the parameters such as Oceanic Fronts, water clarity and sea surface temperature we can trace the distribution of tuna species.

==Tsunami Early Warning System (TEWS)==

In the aftermath of Sumatra earthquake in 2004 and the killer tsunami it set off, the Government of India wanted to set up an early warning centre for tsunami and other storm surges in the Indian Ocean region. Accordingly, on 15 October 2007, a centre housing the Indian Tsunami Early Warning System (TEWS) was established in INCOIS by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the nodal ministry, with the collaboration of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Department of Space (DOS), and Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). At the time of its establishment, the centre had the mandate to provide important tsunami advisories to the people living in the coastal areas of the country. For this purpose, the center was equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure and well trained manpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2618/stories/20090911261811000.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629053728/http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2618/stories/20090911261811000.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 2012, the centre has started to give a round-the-clock alert and advisory services to all Indian Ocean Rim Countries (IOR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629053545/http://www.hindu.com/2011/02/05/stories/2011020551391100.htm|archivedate=29 June 2011|url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/02/05/stories/2011020551391100.htm |title= Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre to turn regional provider  | date=5 February 2011 | newspaper=The Hindu | accessdate=7 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, the tsunami warning centre receives data from 17 seismic stations of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), 10 stations of the [[Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology]] (WIHG) and more than 300 international stations. In addition, it receives data from 17 sea-level tide gauges at intervals of five minutes. These tide gauges have been positioned at [[Aerial Bay]], [[Chennai]], [[Ennore]], [[Garden Reach]], [[Haldia]], [[Kandla]], [[Karwar]], [[Krishnapatnam]], [[Marmagao]], [[Machilipatnam]], [[Nagapattinam]], [[Paradeep]], [[Port Blair]], [[Vadinar]], [[Visakhapatnam]] etc. Apart from sea-level tide sensors, the wave-rider buoys have also been installed at various locations. This network of tide gauges and buoys helps the center to validate the arrivals of tsunami waves in the Indian Ocean region. To further supplement the cause, a network of seismographs has also been installed at appropriate positions to forecast the occurrence of tsunami-producing earthquakes. It has also installed three bottom pressure recorders in different regions to supplement its needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629053715/http://www.hindu.com/2011/03/13/stories/2011031355351200.htm | archivedate=29 June 2011 | url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/03/13/stories/2011031355351200.htm | title=Efficacy of Indian Early Tsunami Warning System proved | first=M.L. Melly | last=Maitreyi | newspaper=The Hindu |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the data obtained from a network of equipments, models have been run to provide maps depicting inundation scenarios for the entire coastal belt. Based on these scenarios, the potential risk zones are identified to generate advisories for various stakeholders in the region. When there is a disaster, the advisories are generated in intervals telling the location of the storm surges or tsunamis to help the local government authorities to evacuate the people from the regions that are likely to be affected.

== Ocean State Forecast (OSF)==
[[File:OCEANSAT-II Ground station.JPG|150px|thumbnail|Ground station of OCEANSAT-II, located inside the INCOIS campus]]
Being a peninsula, India is covered from three sides with water body. Hence there is a need for knowing the state of ocean in advance for carrying out various commercial activities. Prior information about the state of the ocean helps us to plan and execute our activities in the marine environment safely. Moreover, the ocean has an effect on the local climate as well. Thinking about all these factors, a new service was rolled out to forecast the ocean state, which is capable of predicting the surface and sub-surface features of the Indian Ocean in advance. It is called the Indian Ocean Forecasting System (INDOFOS). The forecast is also passed to the stakeholders through Village Information Centers, All India Radio, FM Radio, Digital Display Boards, NGO Websites, and TV channels in the regional languages.

At present, OSF gives forecasts of wave height and direction, sea surface temperature, sea surface currents, mixed layer depth, and depth of 20 degree isotherm. These forecasts are generated by state-of-the art numerical models. These models are customized to simulate and predict the Indian Ocean features realistically. Different models used for forecasts are WAVEWATCH III, WAM, Mike and Regional Ocean Modeling Systems (ROMS). In the forecast mode, these models are forced with atmospheric products developed by various Meteorological agencies to generate different forecasts. Apart from these services, the OSF center also offers value-added services for the benefit of its end users.

The generated forecasts fall under four categories. They are global, regional, location-specific and coastal forecasts. They differ in spatial and temporal resolutions extend of validations. For coastal forecast, the models are set up with the concept of "coarse grid" with coarse resolution in open ocean region whereas very fine resolution is used for location-specific forecasts. These models are tested for their accuracy and reliability by comparing their output with the data from satellite and in-situ measurements. The validation is mainly done during the extreme conditions and monsoon seasons.

==Ocean Observation Group (OOG)==

The main activity of this group in INCOIS is to measure and monitor the surface temperature and salinity of the upper 2000 meters of the ocean. For this purpose, there is a global array of 3000 free-drifting, profiling floats that relay the measurement data to agencies, which in turn make available these data publicly within hours of reception. This will help them to continuously monitor the climate state of the ocean. This system was named as Argo, which emphasizes the strong complementary relationship between the free-drifting floats and Jason altimeter mission.

Basically, Argo builds on the existing upper-ocean thermal networks, extending their spatial and temporal coverage, depth range and accuracy, and improving them through the addition of salinity and velocity measurements. The Argo system helps to study quantitatively the evolving state of the upper ocean and the patterns of its climate variability, including heat, fresh water storage and transport. Apart from these,it also enhances the value of altimeter by sufficiently improving the coverage and resolution of sea surface height variability interpretation and initializes the ocean and coupled forecast models for data assimilation and dynamic model testing.

'''Instantaneous phase''' and '''instantaneous frequency''' are important concepts in [[signal processing]] that occur in the context of the representation and analysis of time-varying functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sejdic|first=E.|last2=Djurovic|first2=I.|last3=Stankovic|first3=L.|date=August 2008|title=Quantitative Performance Analysis of Scalogram as Instantaneous Frequency Estimator|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4511413/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|volume=56|issue=8|pages=3837‚Äì3845|doi=10.1109/TSP.2008.924856|issn=1053-587X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instantaneous phase (or "local phase" or simply "phase") of a ''complex-valued'' function ''s''(''t''), is the real-valued function:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t) = \arg\{s(t)\},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''arg''' is the [[Argument (complex analysis)|complex argument function]].

And for a ''real-valued'' function ''s''(''t''), it is determined from the function's [[analytic signal|analytic representation]], ''s''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackledge|first=Jonathan M.|title=Digital Signal Processing: Mathematical and Computational Methods, Software Development and Applications|year=2006|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|isbn=1904275265|page=134|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\phi(t) &amp;= \arg\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\} \\
        &amp;= \arg\{s(t) + j \hat{s}(t)\}. \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When ''œÜ''(''t'') is constrained to its [[principal value]], either the interval (-œÄ, œÄ] or [0, 2œÄ), it is called ''wrapped phase''. Otherwise it is called ''unwrapped phase'', which is a continuous function of argument ''t'', assuming ''s''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') is a continuous function of ''t''. Unless otherwise indicated, the continuous form should be inferred.

[[File:Phase vs Time, wrapped and unwrapped.jpg|thumb|400px|Instantaneous phase vs time.]]

==Examples==
===Example 1===
:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \theta),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''œâ'' &gt; 0.
:&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{a}(t) = A e^{j(\omega t + \theta)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t) = \omega t + \theta.&lt;/math&gt;
In this simple sinusoidal example, the constant ''Œ∏'' is also commonly referred to as ''phase'' or ''phase offset''. ''œÜ''(''t'') is a function of time; ''Œ∏'' is not. In the next example, we also see that the phase offset of a real-valued sinusoid is ambiguous unless a reference (sin or cos) is specified. ''œÜ''(''t'') is unambiguously defined.

===Example 2===
:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = A \sin(\omega t) = A \cos(\omega t - \pi/2),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''œâ'' &gt; 0.
:&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{a}(t) = A e^{j (\omega t - \pi/2)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t) = \omega t - \pi/2.&lt;/math&gt;
In both examples the local maxima of ''s''(''t'') correspond to ''œÜ''(''t'') = 2œÄ''N'' for integer values of ''N''. This has applications in the field of computer vision.

==Instantaneous frequency==
'''Instantaneous angular frequency''' is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega(t) = \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;
and '''instantaneous (ordinary) frequency''' is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(t) &amp; =  \tfrac{1}{2\pi} \omega(t) \\
     &amp; = \tfrac{1}{2\pi} \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''œÜ''(''t'') '''must''' be the ''unwrapped'' instantaneous phase angle. If ''œÜ''(''t'') is wrapped, discontinuities in ''œÜ''(''t'') will result in [[dirac delta]] impulses in ''f''(''t'').

The inverse operation, which always unwraps phase, is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\phi(t) &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^t \omega(\tau)\, d\tau = 2 \pi \int_{-\infty}^t f(\tau)\, d\tau\\
        &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^0 \omega(\tau)\, d\tau + \int_{0}^{t} \omega(\tau)\, d\tau\\
        &amp;= \phi(0) + \int_0^t \omega(\tau)\, d\tau.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This instantaneous frequency, ''œâ''(t), can be derived directly from the [[Complex number|real and imaginary parts]] of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), instead of the [[Argument (complex analysis)|complex arg]] without concern of phase unwrapping.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\phi(t) &amp;= \arg\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\} \\
        &amp;= \operatorname{atan2}(\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\},\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}) + 2 m_1 \pi \\
        &amp;= \arctan\left( \frac{\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}} \right) + m_2 \pi \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

2''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;œÄ and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;œÄ are the integer multiples of œÄ necessary to add to unwrap the phase. At values of time, ''t'', where there is no change to integer ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the derivative of ''œÜ''(''t'') is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\omega(t) &amp;= \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt} \\
        &amp;= \frac{d}{dt} \arctan\left( \frac{\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}} \right) \\
\\
        &amp;= \frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}} \right)^2} \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}} \right) \\
\\
        &amp;= \frac{\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\} \frac{d\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{dt} - \Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\} \frac{d\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{dt} }{(\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\})^2 + (\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\})^2 } \\
\\
        &amp;= \frac{1}{|s_\mathrm{a}(t)|^2 } \left(\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\} \frac{d\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{dt} - \Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\} \frac{d\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{dt} \right) \\
        &amp;= \frac{1}{(s(t))^2 + ((\hat{s}(t))^2} \left(s(t) \frac{d\hat{s}(t)}{dt} - \hat{s}(t) \frac{ds(t)}{dt} \right) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For discrete-time functions, this can be written as a recursion:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi[n] = \phi[n-1] + \omega[n] = \phi[n-1] + \underbrace{\arg\{s_\mathrm{a}[n]\} - \arg\{s_\mathrm{a}[n-1]\}}_{\Delta \phi[n]}.&lt;/math&gt;

Discontinuities can then be removed by adding 2œÄ whenever Œî''œÜ''[''n''] ‚â§ ‚àíœÄ, and subtracting 2œÄ whenever Œî''œÜ''[''n''] &gt; œÄ. That allows ''œÜ''[''n''] to accumulate without limit and produces an unwrapped instantaneous phase. An equivalent formulation that replaces the modulo 2œÄ operation with a complex multiplication is:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi[n] = \phi[n-1] + \arg\{s_\mathrm{a}[n] \, s_\mathrm{a}^*[n-1]\},&lt;/math&gt;
where the asterisk denotes complex conjugate. The discrete-time instantaneous frequency (in units of radians per sample) is simply the advancement of phase for that sample
:&lt;math&gt;\omega[n] = \arg\{s_\mathrm{a}[n] \, s_\mathrm{a}^*[n-1]\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Complex representation==
In some applications, such as averaging the values of phase at several moments of time, it may be useful to convert each value to a complex number, or vector representation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=S.|title=An Improved Quality Guided Phase Unwrapping Method and Its Applications to MRI|journal=Progress in Electromagnetics Research-PIER|date=2014|volume=145|pages=273‚Äì286|url=http://www.jpier.org/PIER/pier.php?paper=14021005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
e^{i\phi(t)}
&amp;= \frac{s_\mathrm{a}(t)}{|s_\mathrm{a}(t)|}\\
&amp;= \cos(\phi(t)) + i \sin(\phi(t)).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This representation is similar to the wrapped phase representation in that it does not distinguish between multiples of 2œÄ in the phase, but similar to the unwrapped phase representation since it is continuous. A vector-average phase can be obtained as the [[Argument (complex analysis)|arg]] of the sum of the complex numbers without concern about wrap-around.

The '''Islands Society''' is a 510(c)(3) tax-exempt [[nonprofit]] organization whose vision is to be the premier global organization for mobilizing individuals and organizations in island communities to participate in foreign affairs and overseas engagements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandssociety.org/about/overview/|title= Overview|work=islandssociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its policy research centers conduct policy studies and strategic analyses of political, economic, security, environmental, and social issues throughout the world, with a specific focus on insular affairs. Separately, its regional societies develop and implement education and leadership programs that are designed to bring about positive changes in local island communities.

==Mission==
According to the organization's website:

{{quote|The mission of the Islands Society is to inspire and empower islanders to participate in foreign affairs and overseas engagements in order to bring about positive changes in their local communities.}}

==Leadership==
The Islands Society is led by its founder and president, Michael Edward Walsh, who is better known by his pen name ([[Eddie Walsh (journalist)]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandssociety.org/about/our-people/leadership/|title= Leadership|work=islandssociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its founding, the organization has developed strong ties with embassies, think tanks, and universities around the world. This is reflected in the composition of the board of advisors, which includes Ralph Cossa, the president of [[Pacific Forum CSIS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandssociety.org/about/our-people/advisors/|title= Advisors|work=islandssociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other current advisors include the ambassadors, high commissioners, and honorary consuls from Austria, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandssociety.org/about/our-people/advisors/|title= Islands Society - Advisors|work=islandssociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former advisors include Abe Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandssociety.org/about/our-people/past-advisors/|title= Past Advisors|work=islandssociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
The Islands Society is composed of a number of subsidiary policy research centers and regional societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandssociety.org/about/overview/our-structure/|title= Our Structure|work=islandssociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The policy research centers are autonomous think tanks whose mission is to develop innovative policies that bridge the divide between theory and practice in insular affairs. And, the regional societies are autonomous research institutes whose mission is to develop and implement programs that inspire and empower islanders in their region to participate in international engagements.

===Policy research centers===
As of November 2015, the Islands Society has three policy research centers. These include the Center on Public Diplomacy and Insular Affairs (CPDIL), Center on International Law and Insular Affairs (CILIA), and Center on International Security and Insular Affairs (CISIA). Staff affiliated with these centers regularly publish commentary and policy briefs in foreign policy outlets in Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandssociety.org/research/centers/public-diplomacy/publications/|title= Staff Public Diplomacy Publications|work=islandssociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandssociety.org/research/centers/international-security/publications/|title= Staff International Security Publications|work=islandssociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional societies===
As of November 2015, the Islands Society has eight regional societies that serve specific geographic regions of the world. These include the [[Arctic]] Islands Society, [[Baltic states|Baltic]] Islands Society, [[Caribbean]] Islands Society, Inland Islands Society, [[Pacific Islands]] Society, Remote Islands Society, [[Sea Islands]] Society, and [[Mediterranean]] Islands Society. Of these, the Pacific Islands Society is by far the largest.

====Pacific Islands Society====
The Pacific Islands Society (PacSoc) is an influential foreign policy research institute that operates as an autonomous arm of the Islands Society. It is currently based in [[Honolulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandssociety.org/community/regionalsocieties/|title= Regional Societies|work=islandssociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, it has launched numerous programs for women, minorities, veterans, and next generation leaders across the Pacific. It has also attracted a large social media following. As of November 2015, its Facebook page has over 3,800 Likes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pacificislandssociety/|title= Pacific Islands Society|work=facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sea Islands Society====
The Sea Islands Society (SeaSoc) is a public policy research institute that operates as an autonomous arm of the Islands Society. It is based on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/Sea-Islands-Society-1696552123899714/|title= Sea Islands Society|work=facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supports women, minorities, veterans, and next generation leaders who reside on barrier islands off the coast of [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]]. It is also a member of the inter-agency working group that is tasked with establishing the Beaufort County Civil Rights Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/blog/good-pd-starts-home-beaufort-county-sc|title= USC Center on Public Diplomacy|work=uscpublicdiplomacy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Islands Society has developed and implemented a number of programs for women, minorities, veterans, and next generation leaders from island communities. These include Next Generation Artists, Security Scholars, Young Leaders on [[Disarmament]], and Local Female Leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandssociety.org/projects/|title= Projects|work=islandssociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional support===
A number of members of Congress have spoken out in support of the organization's women and next generation programs. These include:
* In 2015, Congresswoman Aumua Amata ([[American Samoa]]) said, ""I am always encouraged whenever I learn of new organizations whose mission is to help promote and assist Pacific Islanders in achieving their goals. It is the work of these organizations that has helped many of our people reach higher and do more than they ever thought possible, and I encourage our young people to get involved and take advantage of the opportunities that groups like the Islands Society provide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radewagen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/aumua-applauds-work-islands-society|title=Aumua Applauds Work of the Islands Society|author=Congresswoman Aumua Amata}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2013, Congressman [[Eni Faleomavaega]] (American Samoa) said, "I encourage every qualified student in American Samoa to take advantage of these unique opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legistorm.com/stormfeed/view_rss/405883/member/226.html|title=Faleomavaega Announces Applications for Federation of American Scientists and Pacific Islands Society Young Leaders Programs Now Available for Students to Apply|author=Congressman Eni Faleomavaega}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merger==
The Islands Society resulted from the merger of two pre-existing nonprofit organizations. In September 2015, the Emerging Science and Technology Policy Centre and the Pacific Islands Society officially merged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scsos.com/Search%20Business%20Filings|title= South Carolina Secretary of State|author=State of South Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that merger, the surviving nonprofit was the Emerging Science and Technology Policy Centre. It was renamed the Islands Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scsos.com/Search%20Business%20Filings|title= South Carolina Secretary of State|author=State of South Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The Islands Society is funded by private sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandssociety.org/about/overview/our-status/|title=Our Status|author=Islands Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; It receives monetary and in-kind support from a variety of individuals and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandssociety.org/about/overview/our-status/|title=Our Status|work=islandssociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In November 2015, the Islands Society was recognized as a 2015 Top-Rated Nonprofit by the users of [[GreatNonprofits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greatnonprofits.org/org/islands-society|title= Islands Society|work=greatnonprofits.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of only 10 recipients in South Carolina and the only recipient from Hilton Head Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greatnonprofits.org/awards/browse/Campaign:Year2015/Issue:All/State:SC|title=2015 Top-Rated Awards - South Carolina|work=greatnonprofits.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the merger, the Pacific Islands Society was also recognized as a 2014 Top-Rated Nonprofit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greatnonprofits.org/org/pacific-islands-society|title=Pacific Islands Society|work=greatnonprofits.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[machine learning]], '''kernel methods''' are a class of algorithms for [[pattern analysis]], whose best known member is the [[support vector machine]] (SVM). The general task of pattern analysis is to find and study general types of relations (for example [[Cluster analysis|clusters]], [[ranking]]s, [[principal components]], [[correlation]]s, [[Statistical classification|classifications]]) in datasets. In its simplest form, the kernel trick means [[Data transformation|transforming data]] into another dimension that has a clear dividing margin between classes of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/support-vector-machine|title=The Kernel Trick|last=|first=|date=|website=deepai.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many algorithms that solve these tasks, the data in raw representation have to be explicitly transformed into [[feature vector]] representations via a user-specified ''[[feature map]]'': in contrast, kernel methods require only a user-specified ''kernel'', i.e., a [[similarity function]] over pairs of data points in raw representation.

Kernel methods  owe their name to the use of [[Positive-definite kernel|kernel function]]s, which enable them to operate in a high-dimensional, ''implicit'' [[feature space]] without ever computing the coordinates of the data in that space, but rather by simply computing the [[inner product]]s between the images of all pairs of data in the feature space.  This operation is often computationally cheaper than the explicit computation of the coordinates.  This approach is called the "'''kernel trick'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pattern Recognition|last=Theodoridis|first=Sergios|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|year=2008|isbn=9780080949123|location=|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Kernel functions have been introduced for sequence data, [[Graph kernel|graphs]], text, images, as well as vectors.

Algorithms capable of operating with kernels include the [[kernel perceptron]], support vector machines (SVM), [[Gaussian process]]es, [[principal components analysis]] (PCA), [[canonical correlation analysis]], [[ridge regression]], [[spectral clustering]], [[Adaptive filter|linear adaptive filters]] and many others. Any [[linear model]] can be turned into a non-linear model by applying the kernel trick to the model: replacing its features (predictors) by a kernel function&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=TP3fDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=Any+linear+model+can+be+turned+into+a+non-linear+model+by+applying+the+kernel+trick+to+the+model:+replacing+its+features+(predictors)+by+a+kernel+function&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WNxgOfOObJ&amp;sig=xlE4QsJVc8of1f_6CK2Zyuvu6nk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjc7JSLur_eAhXNGuwKHXSODAEQ6AEwB3oECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Any%20linear%20model%20can%20be%20turned%20into%20a%20non-linear%20model%20by%20applying%20the%20kernel%20trick%20to%20the%20model:%20replacing%20its%20features%20(predictors)%20by%20a%20kernel%20function&amp;f=false (p. 18)|title=Machine Learning in Java|last=Kaluza|first=Bostjan|date=2016-04-29|publisher=Packt Publishing Ltd|year=|isbn=9781784390365|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Most kernel algorithms are based on [[convex optimization]] or [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenproblems]] and are statistically well-founded. Typically, their statistical properties are analyzed using [[statistical learning theory]] (for example, using [[Rademacher complexity]]).

==Motivation and informal explanation==

Kernel methods can be thought of as [[instance-based learning|instance-based learners]]: rather than learning some fixed set of parameters corresponding to the features of their inputs, they instead "remember" the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th training example &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)&lt;/math&gt; and learn for it a corresponding weight &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Prediction for unlabeled inputs, i.e., those not in the training set, is treated by the application of a [[similarity function]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, called a '''kernel''', between the unlabeled input &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x'}&lt;/math&gt; and each of the training inputs &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_i&lt;/math&gt;.  For instance, a kernelized [[binary classifier]] typically computes a weighted sum of similarities

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{y} = \sgn \sum_{i=1}^n w_i y_i k(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x'})&lt;/math&gt;,

where

* &lt;math&gt;\hat{y} \in \{-1, +1\}&lt;/math&gt; is the kernelized binary classifier's predicted label for the unlabeled input &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x'}&lt;/math&gt; whose hidden true label &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is of interest;
* &lt;math&gt;k \colon \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the kernel function that measures similarity between any pair of inputs &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x'} \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;;
* the sum ranges over the {{mvar|n}} labeled examples &lt;math&gt;\{(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; in the classifier's training set, with &lt;math&gt;y_i \in \{-1, +1\}&lt;/math&gt;;
* the &lt;math&gt;w_i \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are the weights for the training examples, as determined by the learning algorithm;
* the [[sign function]] &lt;math&gt;\sgn&lt;/math&gt; determines whether the predicted classification &lt;math&gt;\hat{y}&lt;/math&gt; comes out positive or negative.

Kernel classifiers were described as early as the 1960s, with the invention of the [[kernel perceptron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aizerman |first=M. A. |first2=Emmanuel M. | last2 = Braverman |first3=L. I. |last3=Rozoner |title=Theoretical foundations of the potential function method in pattern recognition learning |journal=Automation and Remote Control |volume=25 |year=1964 |pages=821‚Äì837}} Cited in {{Cite conference |last1=Guyon |first1=Isabelle |first2=B. |last2=Boser |first3=Vladimir |last3=Vapnik |title=Automatic capacity tuning of very large VC-dimension classifiers |conference=Advances in neural information processing systems |year=1993 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.17.7215}}&lt;/ref&gt; They rose to great prominence with the popularity of the [[support vector machine]] (SVM) in the 1990s, when the SVM was found to be competitive with [[artificial neural network|neural networks]] on tasks such as [[handwriting recognition]].

==Mathematics: the kernel trick==
[[Image:Kernel trick idea.svg|thumb|500px|SVM with kernel given by œÜ((''a'', ''b'')) = (''a'', ''b'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and thus ''K''('''x''', '''y''') = '''x'''‚Ä¢'''y''' + '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; '''y'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The training points are mapped to a 3-dimensional space where a separating hyperplane can be easily found.]]
The kernel trick avoids the explicit mapping that is needed to get linear [[learning algorithms]] to learn a nonlinear function or [[decision boundary]].  For all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x'}&lt;/math&gt; in the input space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, certain functions &lt;math&gt;k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x'})&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as an [[inner product]] in another space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;k \colon \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is often referred to as a ''kernel'' or a ''[[kernel function]]''. The word "kernel" is used in mathematics to denote a weighting function for a weighted sum or [[integral]].

Certain problems in machine learning have additional structure than an arbitrary weighting function &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.  The computation is made much simpler if the kernel can be written in the form of a "feature map" &lt;math&gt;\varphi\colon \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x'}) = \langle \varphi(\mathbf{x}), \varphi(\mathbf{x'}) \rangle_\mathcal{V}.&lt;/math&gt;
The key restriction is that &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; must be a proper inner product.
On the other hand, an explicit representation for &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is not necessary, as long as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[inner product space]].  The alternative follows from [[Mercer's theorem]]: an implicitly defined function &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; exists whenever the space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; can be equipped with a suitable [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] ensuring the function &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; satisfies [[Mercer's condition]].

Mercer's theorem is similar to a generalization of the result from linear algebra that [[Positive-definite matrix#Characterizations|associates an inner product to any positive-definite matrix]].  In fact,  Mercer's condition can be reduced to this simpler case.  If we choose as our measure the [[counting measure]] &lt;math&gt; \mu(T) = |T| &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; T \subset X &lt;/math&gt;, which counts the number of points inside the set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, then the integral in Mercer's theorem reduces to a summation
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n k(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j) c_i c_j \geq 0.&lt;/math&gt;
If this summation holds for all finite sequences of points &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}_1, \dotsc, \mathbf{x}_n)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; and all choices of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; real-valued coefficients &lt;math&gt;(c_1, \dots, c_n)&lt;/math&gt; (cf. [[positive definite kernel]]), then the function &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; satisfies Mercer's condition.

Some algorithms that depend on arbitrary relationships in the native space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; would, in fact, have a linear interpretation in a different setting: the range space of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. The linear interpretation gives us insight about the algorithm. Furthermore, there is often no need to compute &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; directly during computation, as is the case with [[support vector machines]]. Some cite this running time shortcut as the primary benefit. Researchers also use it to justify the meanings and properties of existing algorithms.

Theoretically, a [[Gram matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{x}_1, \dotsc, \mathbf{x}_n\}&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes also called a "kernel matrix"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | first1 = Thomas | last1 = Hofmann | first2 = Bernhard | last2 = Scholkopf | first3 = Alexander J. | last3 = Smola | date = 2008 | title = Kernel Methods in Machine Learning }}&lt;/ref&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;K_{ij} = k(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j)&lt;/math&gt;, must be [[Positive-definite matrix|positive semi-definite (PSD)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Mehryar Afshin Ameet 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirically, for machine learning heuristics, choices of a function &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; that do not satisfy Mercer's condition may still perform reasonably if &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; at least approximates the intuitive idea of similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svms.org/mercer/|title=Support Vector Machines: Mercer's Condition|first=Martin|last=Sewell|date=|website=www.svms.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a Mercer kernel, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; may still be referred to as a "kernel".

If the kernel function &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is also a [[covariance function]] as used in [[Gaussian processes]], then the Gram matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; can also be called a [[covariance matrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | first1 = C. E. | last1 = Rasmussen | first2 = C. K. I. | last2 = Williams | date = 2006 | title = Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Application areas of kernel methods are diverse and include [[geostatistics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honarkhah | first1 = M. | last2 = Caers | first2 = J. | date = 2010 | doi = 10.1007/s11004-010-9276-7 | title = Stochastic Simulation of Patterns Using Distance-Based Pattern Modeling |journal=[[Mathematical Geosciences]] | volume = 42 | pages = 487‚Äì517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[kriging]], [[inverse distance weighting]], [[3D reconstruction]], [[bioinformatics]], [[chemoinformatics]], [[information extraction]] and [[handwriting recognition]].

The '''Malaysian Physics Institute''' (''Institut Fizik Malaysia'' or '''IFM''') is the sole representative body for physicists and for those involved in the practice of [[physics]] or physics related work in [[Malaysia]].

==Objectives==
# promotion of the advancement of physics.
# promotion of activities that will bring together members to co-operate in the fields of education, training and practice of physics
# elevation of the professional status of physicist.

==History==
The need for a single body to represent the growing number of physicists in the country was felt by many since the early sixties. Although most physicists in the universities were member of the [[Institute of Physics|UK Institute of Physics]] (IOP), the majority of physicists, especially teachers and those in the research and service sectors, were not.
The first interim committee met in [[Kuala Lumpur]] in 1971. The Institute's constitution was later formally approved and IFM was thus established in 1973 with an initial membership of 35. Although the growth of the Institute was initially slow, by 2009 the number of members exceeded 1200, reflecting the continuing acceptance and support of the Institute by the country's physics community.

==Activities==
IFM organises conferences, seminars courses, workshops and meetings on issues which are not only of current interest to physicists, but also on issues which highlight the important role of physics in the country's development. The National Physics Symposium is held once every two years. Here physicists meet to discuss issues pertaining to the many areas of physics. International and regional meetings are also organised. Special courses are held from time to time, e.g. courses on microcomputers, lasers, plasmas, etc.

The Institute publishes a quarterly journal (''JURNAL FIZIK MALAYSIA'')[http://ifm.org.my/jurnal-fizik-malaysia] to report up-to-date research findings in physics. A newsletter, ''BERITA FIZIK'', is published quartely to report current and future activities of the Institute. A magazine, ''MAJALAH FIZIK'', is biannual and contains popular articles.

==Associations==
The IFM is a member and associate of multiple Associations:
* A member entity of the Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics (APCTP),
* A member of the Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies (AAPPS).
* A member of the Confederation of Scientific and Technological Associations in Malaysia (COSTAM).
* An associate member of the Asia Oceania Forum for Synchrotron Radiation Research

IFM also cooperates with most other physics institutes/organisations of other countries.

The '''Mammalian Genetics Unit''' is a genetics and genomics research institute in [[Oxfordshire]].

==History==
Earlier research on the same site at the Radiobiology Research Unit, which opened in 1954, in the 1950s was into [[cytogenetics]], where [[Charles Edmund Ford]] and [[John Hamerton]] confirmed on 12 January 1956 the size of the human genome. In the early 1970s this unit led research into [[Mutagenesis|mutagenic]] effects of radiation on the human chromosome. In the mid-1980s, important early work was done in [[genomic imprinting]].

From 2007, the site no longer carried work into the effects of radiation on genes ([[radiobiology]]).

===MGU===
The MGU is largely derived from the earlier Radiobiology Unit (RBU). In 2010, work at the unit discovered that overexpression of the [[FTO gene]] led to obesity.

==Structure==
The unit is in [[Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref name="oxfordshireapprenticeships"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordshireapprenticeships.co.uk/content/meet-jess-apprentice-machinist-mrc-harwell|website=oxfordshireapprenticeships.co.uk|title=Oxfordshire Apprenticeships|accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The unit carries out work into genetics and [[genome engineering]].

The '''Mexico Peace Index (MPI)''' is one in a series of National Peace Indices produced by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace|Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP)]]. The MPI provides a comprehensive measure of peacefulness in Mexico, the fifth edition of the MPI was released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones/view/Violencia_le_costo_a_Mexico_el_18_de_su_PIB_en_2016_segun_estudio-1077123|title=Violencia le cost√≥ a M√©xico el 18% de su PIB en 2016, seg√∫n estudio - Peri√≥dico Noroeste|website=Noroeste.com.mx|language=es|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is released in both Spanish and English, and analyzes the economic benefits that would occur from increases in peace, and provides an estimate relating to the economic impact violence has had on Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/2013/12/mexico-peace-index-just-launched/ 'Mexico Peace Index just launched'] Alliance for Peacebuilding, retrieved 2013-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Index uses the same definition of peace as the [[Global Peace Index]], [[United States Peace Index]] and [[United Kingdom Peace Index]], which it defines as the absence of violence or the absence of the fear of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/MPI%20Report%202013.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mexico Peace Index 2013 |page=4 |website=Visionofhumanity.org |accessdate=2017-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213145206/http://visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/MPI%20Report%202013.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year a large press conference is held and attended by many civil society reps, including [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|INEGI]], COMCE, [[Coparmex]], [[FEMSA]], Mexico Evalua, Mexico Contra la Delincuencia. Additionally the press conferences are attended by journalists from multiple media outlets including the [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]], AFP, EFE, [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]], [[The New York Times|NY Times]], [[Telemundo]], Reforma, [[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]], [[El Economista (Mexico)|El Economista]], [[TV Azteca]], [[Milenio Televisi√≥n|Milenio TV]], Expansion, Radio Formula, MVS Radio, W Radio, [[Notimex]]. Each year the launch of the report generates wide spread domestic media coverage, with 500 media pieces covering the 2017 launch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6517">'''Moshe Greenberg''' ([[Hebrew]]: ◊û◊©◊î ◊í◊®◊ô◊†◊ë◊®◊í; July 10, 1928 ‚Äì May 15, 2010) was an American Jewish [[rabbi]], [[Bible]] scholar, and professor emeritus of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

==Biography==
Moshe Greenberg was born in [[Philadelphia]] in 1928. Raised in a Hebrew-speaking [[Zionist]] home, he studied Bible and Hebrew literature from his youth. His father, Rabbi [[Simon Greenberg]], was the rabbi of Har Zion Temple and one of the most important leaders of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative movement]]. Moshe Greenberg received his doctorate from the  [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1954, studying  Bible and [[Assyriology]] under [[E. A. Speiser]]; simultaneously, he studied post-Biblical [[Judaica]] at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTSA), where he was ordained as a rabbi. Greenberg was married to Evelyn Gelber and had three sons. He died in [[Jerusalem]] after a long illness.&lt;ref name="jewishexponent.com"&gt;[http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/21288/ Professor's Death Means Loss of a Biblical Giant]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic and literary career==
Greenberg taught Bible and Judaica at the University of Pennsylvania from 1964-1970.  He held a chair in [[Jewish studies]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], an institution at which he had taught since 1970. He also taught at [[Swarthmore College]], the JTSA,  the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies]].  Greenberg was editor-in-chief of the [[Ketuvim]] section of the [[Jewish Publication Society of America]]'s [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|new English]] translation of the [[Bible]]. He was the author of ten books and numerous articles.

==Scholarship==
Greenberg was the first Jewish Bible scholar appointed to a position in a secular university after [[World War II]] and had an important influence on the development of [[Biblical scholarship]].&lt;ref name="jewishexponent.com"/&gt; He focused on the phenomenology of biblical religion and law, the theory and practice of interpreting biblical texts, and the role of  the Bible in Jewish thought. In the area of prayer, Greenberg studied the development of biblical petition and  praise, which he portrayed as  "a vehicle of humility, an expression of  un-selfsufficiency, which in biblical thought, is the proper stance  of  humans before God" (Studies, 75-108).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/20/arts/20greenberg.html New York Times obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that the prose prayers embedded in biblical narratives reflect the piety of commoners, and reasoned that the frequency of spontaneous prayer strengthened the egalitarian tendency of Israelite religion which led to the establishment  of  the  [[synagogue]]. In the  area  of biblical law, Greenberg argued that "the law [is] the expression of underlying postulates or  values of culture" and that differences  between biblical and ancient Near Eastern laws  were not reflections  of  different stages of social  development  but  of different underlying legal and religious principles (Studies, 25-41). Analyzing economic, social,  political,  and religious laws in the [[Torah]], he showed that they dispersed authority throughout society and prevented the monopolization of prestige and  power by narrow elite groups (Studies, 51-61). In his commentaries on [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] (1969) and [[Ezekiel]]  (1983, 1997), Greenberg developed  a "holistic"  method  of  exegesis, redirecting attention from the text's  "hypothetically  reconstructed  elements"  to the  biblical  books  as integral  wholes and products of  thoughtful  and  artistic design. 	Greenberg's studies of Jewish thought include studies of the  intellectual  achievements  of  medieval  Jewish   exegesis, investigations  of rabbinic  reflections on defying illegal orders (Studies, 395-403), and  attitudes toward members of other  religions  (Studies, 369-393; "A Problematic Heritage"). He argued that a  Scripture-based  religion must avoid fundamentalism through selectivity and re-prioritizing values.

==Awards==
* In 1961, Greenberg was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].
* He was also awarded  the Harrison Prize for Distinguished Teaching and Research.
* In 1994, he was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] in Bible.&lt;ref name=prize&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site - Recipients in 1994 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/TashnagTashsab/TASNAG_TASNAT_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashnad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg also taught at Beyt Midrash leShalom, the Peace Study Center sponsored jointly by the Israeli Religious Peace Movement Netivot Shalom and by Tikkun Magazine.

== Introduction ==
'''Munitions Safety Information Analysis Center''', also referred to as MSIAC, is a NATO project funded directly by its member nations, not all of which are [[NATO]] members. There are currently 15 member nations: [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Poland]] and [[Republic of Korea]].

== History ==

=== Pilot-Nato Insensitive Munition Information Center (Pilot-NIMIC) ===
On May 26, 1988 the NATO nations France, Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States based on a Memorandum of Understanding decided to create Pilot-NIMIC (''NIMIC = NATO Insensitive Munitions Information Center''). The organization was intended to assist national and international programs to develop insensitive munitions (IM).&lt;ref name= "1. NIMIC Newsletter"&gt;''PNIMIC Newsletter'' '''1989''', ''1'', Johns Hopkins University Laurel Maryland, USA&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for NIMIC was born at the NATO AC/310 "Workshop on Insensitive Munitions Information Exchange" in 1986 and was actively supported by the Chairman of AC/310, IGA M. Th√©venin and Principal US Member of AC/310, Dr. R. Derr.&lt;ref&gt;''PNIMIC Newsletter'' '''1989''', ''3'', Johns Hopkins University Laurel Maryland, USA&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of this organization was promoted by former NATO Group AC/310 (Safety and Suitability for Service of Munitions and Explosives) in an effort to support munitions developers located in NATO countries. The PILOT-NIMIC office was located at [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] (APL) of [[Johns Hopkins University]], Laurel, Maryland, USA. The initial team comprised a project manager and five technical specialists  - basically the same structure MSIAC shows today (see below).  Soon after its foundation Canada joined the project in late 1989.

[[File:MSIAC_25_HQ.jpg|thumb|Celebrating 25 Years of MSIAC (15 december, 2016))]]
=== NIMIC Move to Brussels and Growth ===
After its first successful two years of operation the project moved to NATO Headquarters Brussels and officially became NIMIC on May 1, 1991.  Spain and Australia entered the project in 1994, Portugal and Italy became members in 1995. In 1998 Portugal decided to leave NIMIC. Denmark entered the project 1999 but left soon after in 2004.

=== Merger of AC/258 and AC/310 and Transition to MSIAC ===
In May 2003 the [[Conference of National Armament Directors]] (CNAD) Ammunition Safety Group (AC/326) (CASG) was formed by a merger of former AC/258 Group of Experts on the Safety Aspects of Transportation and Storage of Military Ammunition and Explosives and the former AC/310 Group of Safety and Suitability for Service of Munitions and Explosives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/structur/AC/326/introduction.htm] CNAD Ammunition Safety Group (AC/326)Homepage&lt;/ref&gt;  With a given broader emphasis on Munitions Safety it was decided to modify NIMIC's scope to take this change into account. Hence its transition to Munitions Safety Information Analysis Center (MSIAC) began with the Pilot MSIAC phase in Spring 2003. The successful transition was accomplished by late 2004 and MSIAC was officially operational on December 15, 2004. Germany finally entered the project in 2005. [[Belgium]] entered MSIAC in 2015, [[Poland]] - in 2017 and [[Republic of Korea]] - in 2018.

== Organization ==
The MSIAC Project Office consists of a steering committee, National Focal Point Officers (NFPO) and an Information Analysis Center (MSIAC). The steering committee is made up of one voting representative from each member nation and an elected chairman. It is responsible for implementing the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that established MSIAC and for developing its policy. This policy is carried out on a day-to-day basis by the MSIAC Project Manager.

== Tasks ==
The '''NATO Munitions Safety Information Analysis Center''' (MSIAC) (''Centre d'information et d'analyse sur la s√©curit√© des munitions de l'OTAN'' (CIASM) in French) provides technical consultancy services to its member nations in the area of munitions safety.

'''NeuroLex''' is a dynamic [[lexicon]] of [[neuroscience]] concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Initial content for this article was adapted from the NeuroLex project which is licensed under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution License].&lt;/ref&gt; It is a structured as a [[semantic wiki]], using [[Semantic MediaWiki]]. NeuroLex is supported by the [[Neuroscience Information Framework]] project.

== Overview ==
The NeuroLex is intended to help improve the way that neuroscientists communicate about their data, so that information systems like the NIF can find data more easily and provide more powerful means of integrating data that occur across distributed resources.  One of the big roadblocks to data integration in neuroscience is the inconsistent use of [[terminology]] in databases and other resources like the [[literature]]. When one uses the same terms to mean different things, one cannot easily ask questions that span across multiple resources.  For example, if three databases have information about what [[gene]]s are expressed in [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]], but they all use different definitions of [[cerebral cortex]], then one cannot compare them easily.

== Utilization within the Neuroscience Information Framework ==
The NIF enables discovery and access to public research data and tools worldwide through an open source, networked environment. Funded by the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] Blueprint for Neuroscience Research,&lt;ref&gt;The [http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research] is a cooperative effort among the 16 NIH Institutes, Centers and Offices that support neuroscience research. By pooling resources and expertise, the Blueprint supports the development of new tools, training opportunities, and other resources to assist neuroscientists in both basic and clinical research. [http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/blueprint_basics/about_blueprint.htm Read more about the Blueprint].&lt;/ref&gt; the NIF enables scientists and students to discover global neuroscience web resources that cut across traditional boundaries ‚Äì from experimental, clinical and translational neuroscience databases, to knowledge bases, atlases, and genetic/genomic resources.

Unlike general search engines, NIF provides deeper access to a more focused set of resources that are relevant to neuroscience, search strategies tailored to neuroscience, and access to content that is traditionally ‚Äúhidden‚Äù from [[web search engine]]s.  The Framework is a dynamic inventory of neuroscience databases, annotated and integrated with a unified system of [[Ontology|biomedical terminology]] (i.e. NeuroLex). NIF supports concept-based queries across multiple scales of biological structure and multiple levels of biological function, making it easier to search for and understand the results.

As part of the NIF, a search interface to many different sources of neuroscience information and data is provided.  To make this search more effective, the NIF is constructing ontologies to help organize neuroscience concepts into category hierarchies, e.g. stating that a [[neuron]] is a [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. This allows users to perform more effective searches and also to organize and understand the information that is returned.  But an important adjunct to this activity is to clearly define all of the terms that are used to describe data, e.g., anatomical terms, techniques, [[organism]] names.

== Content ==
The initial entries in the NeuroLex were built from the NIFSTD ontologies which subsumed an earlier vocabulary BIRNLex.  It currently contains concepts that span gross anatomy, cells of the [[nervous system]], subcellular structures, [[disease]]s, functions and techniques. NIF is soliciting community input to add more content and correct what is there.

'''Neutrality''' is the tendency not to ''side'' in a conflict (physical or ideological),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/neutral|title=the definition of neutral|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neutrality|title=Definition of NEUTRALITY|author=|date=|website=www.Merriam-Webster.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IFRC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/who-we-are/vision-and-mission/the-seven-fundamental-principles/neutrality/|title=Neutrality - IFRC|author=|date=|website=www.IFRC.org|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may not suggest neutral parties do not have a side or are not a side themselves.
In colloquial use ''neutral'' can be synonymous with ''unbiased''. However, bias is a favoritism for some side,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bias|title=the definition of bias|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bias|title=Definition of BIAS|author=|date=|website=www.Merriam-Webster.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinct of the tendency to act on that favoritism.

Neutrality is distinct (though not exclusive) from [[apathy]], [[ignorance]], indifference, [[doublethink]], equality,&lt;ref name="ASM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asm.wisc.edu/viewpoint-neutrality-in-funding-decisions.html|title=Associated Students of Madison, Viewpoint Neutrality in Funding Decisions|author=|date=|website=Wisc.edu|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consensus|agreement]], and [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]]. Objectivity suggests siding with the more reasonable position (except [[journalistic objectivity]]), where reasonableness is judged by some common basis between the sides, such as logic (thereby avoiding the problem of [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]]). Neutrality implies tolerance regardless of how disagreeable, deplorable, or unusual a perspective might be.&lt;ref name="ASM" /&gt; Advocating neutrality is neutral attitude.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In moderation and mediation, neutrality is often expected to make judgments or facilitate dialog independent of any bias, putting emphasis on the process rather than the outcome.&lt;ref name="ASM"/&gt; For example, a neutral-party is seen as a party with no (or a fully disclosed) [[conflict of interest]] in a conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/neutral-party.html|title=What is neutral party? definition and meaning|author=|date=|website=BusinessDictionary.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to operate as-if it has no bias.
Neutral parties are often perceived as more trustworthy, reliable, and safe.&lt;ref name="IFRC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emotional-neutrality.asp|title=Emotional Neutrality|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=21 May 2008|website=Investopedia.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative to acting without a bias, the bias of neutrality itself is the expectation upon the Swiss government (in [[armed neutrality]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/specials/switzerland_how_to/politics/Armed_neutrality.html?cid=29289102|title=Armed neutrality|author=|date=|website=SwissInfo.ch|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (in [[non-interventionism]]).&lt;ref name="IFRC"/&gt;

==Criticisms and views==
Neutrality implies not judging the validity of an opinion.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
Thus, a neutral position will provide a platform for all opinions, including irrational or malicious ones.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In classical periods of enlightenment, neutrality has been looked down upon as a character vice, an escape from one's duty to think and to act,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} as opposed to the modern trend of esteeming neutrality as a virtue.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Other views include:
* [[Woodrow Wilson]]: "Neutrality is a negative word. It does not express what America ought to feel. We are not trying to keep out of trouble; we are trying to preserve the foundations on which peace may be rebuilt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/woodrowwil401895.html|title=Woodrow Wilson Quotes|author=|date=|website=BrainyQuote.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Supreme Court decision ''Southworth v. The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System'' based on the United States Constitution's First Amendment, the court decided some funding decisions should be made through a neutral viewpoint.&lt;ref name="ASM" /&gt;
* The [[Oxford_English_Dictionary#Historical_nature|Oxford English Dictionary]] documents that by at least 1897 "neutral" meant applying the rules to the facts, as in football "Neutral linesmen shall officiate in all games."&lt;ref&gt;"neutral, n. and adj.", B.I.3.b.

French social philosopher [[Alfred Espinas]] gave the term its modern meaning, and its study was developed independently by two principal groups: the [[Austrian school]] created by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and the Polish school created by [[Tadeusz Kotarbi≈Ñski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Ryan |editor1-first=Leo V. |editor2-last=Nahser |editor2-first=F. Byron |editor3-last=Gasparski |editor3-first=Wojciech |date=2002 |title=Praxiology and pragmatism |series=Praxiology: the international annual of practical philosophy and methodology |volume=10 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] |pages=7‚Äì9 |isbn=0765801671 |oclc=49617735 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and etymology==
Coinage of the word ''praxeology'' is often credited to Louis Bourdeau, the French author of a classification of the sciences, which he published in his ''Th√©orie des sciences: Plan de Science int√©grale'' in 1882:

{{quote|On account of their dual natures of specialty and generality, these functions should be the subject of a separate science. Some of its parts have been studied for a long time, because this kind of research, in which man could be the main subject, has always presented the greatest interest. Physiology, hygiene, medicine, psychology, animal history, human history, political economy, morality, etc. represent fragments of a science that we would like to establish, but as fragments scattered and uncoordinated have remained until now only parts of particular sciences. They should be joined together and made whole in order to highlight the order of the whole and its unity. Now you have a science, so far unnamed, which we propose to call Praxeology (from œÄœÅŒ±ŒæŒπœÇ, action), or by referring to the influence of the environment, [[Mesology]] (from ŒºŒµœÉŒøœÇ, environment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdeau|first=Louis|title=Th√©orie des sciences: Plan de Science int√©grale|volume=Tome Second|publisher=Librarie Germer Bailli√®re|location=Paris|date=1882|quote=√Ä raison de leur double caract√®re de sp√©cialit√© et de g√©n√©ralit√©, les fonctions doivent constituer l'objet d'une science distincte. Quelques‚Äîunes de ses parties ont √©t√© √©tudi√©es de bonne heure, car ce genre de recherches, dont l'homme pouvait se faire le sujet principal, a pr√©sent√© de tout temps le plus vif int√©r√™t. La physiologie, l'hygi√®ne, la m√©decine, la psychologie, l'histoire des animaux, l'histoire humaine, l'√©conomie politique, la morale, etc., repr√©sentent des fragments de la science que nous voudrions √©tablir; mais fragments, √©pars et sans coordination, sont rest√©s a l'√©tat de sciences particuli√®res. Il faudrait les rapprocher et en faire un tout afin de mettre en lumi√®re l'ordre de l'ensemble et son unit√©. On aurait alors une‚Ä¶ science, innomm√©e jusqu'ici et que nous proposons d'appeler Prax√©ologie (de œÄœÅŒ±ŒæŒπœÇ, action), ou, en se r√©f√©rant a l'influence des milieu, M√©sologie (de ŒºŒµ∆°ŒøœÇ, milieu).|page=463|url=http://iris.univ-lille1.fr/handle/1908/3842|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the term was used at least once previously (with a slight spelling difference), in 1608, by [[Clemens Timpler]] in his ''Philosophiae practicae systema methodicum'':

{{quote|There was Aretology: Following that Praxiology: which is the second part of the Ethics, in general, commenting on the actions of the moral virtues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Timpler|first=Clemens|title=Philosophiae practicae systema methodicum|volume=libris IV pertractatam|location=Hanoviae|publisher=Apud Gulielmum Antonio|date=1608|page=388|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_IaPUCZDkdQYC#page/n418/mode/1up|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}|quote=Fuit Aretologia: Sequitur Praxiologia: qu√¶ est altera pars Ethic√¶, tractans generaliter de actionibus moralibus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was later mentioned by [[Robert Flint]] in 1904 in a review of Bourdeau's ''Th√©orie des sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Flint|title=Philosophy as Scientia Scientiarum|location=Edinburgh|date=1904|pages=254‚Äì55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern definition of the word was first given by [[Alfred Espinas|Alfred V. Espinas]] (1844‚Äì1922),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrowski|first=Jean J.|title=Notes biographiques et bibliographiques sur Alfred Espinas|journal=Review Philosophique de la France et de l'Etranger|location=Paris|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France|number=3|date=July‚ÄìSeptember 1967|pages=385‚Äì91}}&lt;/ref&gt; the French philosopher and sociologist; he was the forerunner of the Polish school of the science of [[Efficiency|efficient]] action. The Austro-American school of economics was based on a philosophical science of the same kind.

With a different spelling, the word was used by the English psychologist [[Charles Arthur Mercier]] (in 1911), and proposed by [[Knight Dunlap]] to [[John B. Watson]] as a better name for his [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=John B.|title=Behaviourism: The Early Years|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2018}} Watson rejected it. But the Chinese physiologist of behavior, [[Zing-Yang Kuo]] (b. 1898) adopted the term in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Murchison, Carl Allanmore, ''[[The Journal of Psychology]]'', Volumes 3‚Äì4, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2018}} It was also used by [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] (in 1928 and later).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=McDougall|title=The Battle of Behaviorism: An Exposition and an Exposure|date=1928|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Previously the word ''praxiology'', with the meaning Espinas gave to it, was used by [[Tadeusz Kotarbi≈Ñski]] (in 1923). Several economists, such as the Ukrainian, [[Eugene Slutsky]] (1926) used it in his attempt to base economics on a theory of action. It was also used by [[Austrian economics|Austrian economist]] Ludwig von Mises (1933), Russian Marxist [[Nikolai Bukharin]] (1888‚Äì1938) during the [[Second International]] Congress of History of Science and Technology in London (in 1931), and Polish scholar [[Oskar R. Lange|Oscar Lange]] (1904‚Äì1965) in 1959, and later.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Italian philosopher, Carmelo Ottaviano, was using the Italianised version, ''prassiologia'', in his treatises starting from 1935, but in his own way, as a theory of politics. After the [[Second World War]] the use of the term ''praxeology'' spread widely. After the emigration of Mises to America his pupil [[Murray Rothbard]] defended the praxeological approach. A revival of Espinas's approach in France was revealed in the works of [[Pierre Mass√©]] (1946), the eminent cybernetician, Georges Th√©odule Guilbaud (1953), the Belgian logician, [[Leo Apostel]] (1957), the cybernetician, [[Anatol Rapoport]] (1962), Henry Pierron, psychologist and lexicographer (1957), [[Fran√ßois Perroux]], economist (1957), the social psychologist, Robert Daval (1963), the well-known sociologist, [[Raymond Aron]] (1963) and the methodologists, Abraham Antoine Moles and Roland Caude (1965).{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Under the influence of [[Tadeusz Kotarbi≈Ñski]], praxeology flourished in Poland. A special "Centre of Praxeology" (''Zaklad Prakseologiczny'') was created under the organizational guidance of the Polish Academy of Sciences, with its own periodical (from 1962), called at first ''Materia≈Çy Prakseologiczne'' (''Praxeological Papers''), and then abbreviated to ''Prakseologia''. It published hundreds of papers by different authors, and the materials for a special vocabulary edited by Professor Tadeusz Pszczolowski, the leading praxeologist of the younger generation. A sweeping survey of the praxeological approach is to be found in the paper by the French [[statistician]] Micheline Petruszewycz, "A propos de la prax√©ologie".&lt;ref&gt;In 'Math√©matiques et Sciences Humaines', Paris, Centre de math√©matique sociale et de statistique-Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, No. 11. Ete, 1965, pp. 11‚Äì18, and a rejoinder 'R√©ponse a un appel' by J. Ostrowski, ''ibid'',, No. 19, Ete, 1967, pp. 21‚Äì26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig von Mises]] was influenced by several theories in forming his work on praxeology, including [[Immanuel Kant]]'s works, [[Max Weber]]'s work on [[methodological individualism]], and [[Carl Menger]]'s development of the [[subjective theory of value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selgin|first=George A.|title=Praxeology and Understanding: An Analysis of the Controversy in Austrian Economics|url=https://mises.org/library/praxeology-and-understanding-analysis-controversy-austrian-economics-0|journal=Review of Austrian Economics|volume=2|date=1987|page=22|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austrian economics==
{{Austrian School sidebar |expanded=Theory}}
[[Austrian economics]] relies heavily on praxeology in the development of its economic theories.&lt;ref name="rothmeth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothbard|first=Murray N.|chapter=Praxeology: The Methodology of Austrian Economics|title=The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics|date=1976|pages=19‚Äì39|chapterurl=https://mises.org/library/praxeology-methodology-austrian-economics|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig von Mises considered economics to be a sub-discipline of praxeology.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Austrian School economists continue to use praxeology and deduction, rather than empirical studies, to determine economic principles. According to its theorists, with the [[action axiom]] as the starting point, it is possible to draw conclusions about human behavior that are both objective and universal. For example, the notion that humans engage in acts of choice implies that they have preferences, and this must be true for anyone who exhibits intentional behavior.

Advocates of praxeology also say that it provides insights for the field of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. "Praxeology, value judgments, and public policy." ''The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics'' (1976): 89‚Äì114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdivisions===
In 1951, [[Murray Rothbard]] divided the subfields of praxeology as follows:
: A. The Theory of the Isolated Individual ([[Robinson Crusoe Economy|Crusoe Economics]])
: B. The Theory of Voluntary Interpersonal Exchange ([[Catallactics]], or the Economics of the Market)
:: 1. [[Barter]]
:: 2. With [[Money|Medium of Exchange]]
::: a. On the [[Free Market|Unhampered Market]]
::: b. Effects of [[government|Violent Intervention]] with the Market
::: c. Effects of Violent Abolition of the Market (Socialism)
: C. The Theory of [[War]] ‚Äì Hostile Action
: D. The Theory of Games (e.g., [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]])
: E. Unknown
At the time, topics C, D, and E remained open research problems.&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard. [https://www.mises.org/library/praxeology-reply-mr-schuller "Praxeology: Reply to Mr. Schuller"], ''[[American Economic Review]]'', December 1951, pp. 943‚Äì46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
[[Thomas Mayer (American economist)|Thomas Mayer]] has argued that, because praxeology rejects [[positivism]] and [[empiricism]] in the development of [[Scientific theory#Pedagogical definition|theories]], it constitutes nothing less than a rejection of the [[Scientific method#Characterizations|scientific method]]. For Mayer, this invalidates the methodologies of the [[Austrian school of economics]].&lt;ref name="Mayer1998"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Thomas |last=Mayer |title=Boettke's Austrian critique of mainstream economics: An empiricist's response |publisher=Routledge|journal=Critical Review |date=Winter 1998 |pages=151‚Äì71 |ref=harv|doi=10.1080/08913819808443491|volume=12 |quote=}}{{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton1999"&gt;"Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]", {{harvnb |Newton |1999 |pp=794‚Äì96 }}, from Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrians argue that that empirical data itself is insufficient to describe economics; that consequently empirical data cannot falsify economic theory; that logical positivism cannot predict or explain human action; and that the methodological requirements of logical positivism are impossible to obtain for economic questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ludwig von|last=Mises|title=Epistemological Problems of Economics|edition=3rd|date=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|translator-last=Reisman|translator-first=George|url=https://mises.org/library/epistemological-problems-economics|accessdate={{date|2017-02|04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rothmeth" /&gt; Ludwig von Mises in particular argued against empiricist approaches to the social sciences in general, because human events are unique and "unrepeatable," whereas scientific experiments are necessarily reducible.&lt;ref name="MisesHumanAction"&gt;Mises, Ludwig von. ''[[Human Action]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

However, economist Antony Davies argues that because statistical tests are predicated on the independent development of theory, some form of praxeology is essential for model selection; conversely, the praxeology can illustrate surprising philosophical consequences of economic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cato-unbound.org/2012/09/12/antony-davies/complementary-approaches|title=Complementary Approaches|first=Antony|last=Davies|date={{date|2012-09-12}}|website=Cato Unbound|access-date={{date|2016-12-27}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''radiography of cultural objects''' is the use of [[radiography]] to understand intrinsic details about objects. This process can reveal various details about objects that are not visible to the naked eye. This information, which includes structural elements, aids [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] as they assess object condition and consider treatment plans. Radiography can also reveal previous compositions and earlier repairs.

== Use and precautions ==
[[Infrared]] and [[ultraviolet light]] are also useful tools to understand the intrinsic details of certain objects. However, x-rays tend to be more useful for denser objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artcons.udel.edu/about/kress/examination-techniques-and-scientific-terms/x-radiography Art Conservation at the [[University of Delaware]] (2014).  X-radiography. Retrieved from artcons.udel.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of radiography is that it is not intrusive. Radiography does expose the object to [[radiation]], but these levels are low. In fact, they are much lower than the radiation levels required for medical x-rays. While technicians and staff conducting the x-ray must use protective gear, the object is not damaged during the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/xray.html Pigments through the Ages: X-rays. (n.d.) Retrieved from  webexhibits.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icdd.com/resources/axa/vol47/v47_01.pdf Schreiner, B., Fr√ºhmann, B., Jembrih-Simb√ºrger, D. &amp; Linke, R. (2004).

[[Paints]] are produced with a variety of [[Chemical Elements|elements]]. Depending on how much these pigments absorb x-rays affects how clear or opaque they will appear in the radiograph, this is known as x-ray [[fluorescence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/xray.html Pigments through the Ages: X-rays.

An x-ray of the [[Ghent Altarpiece]], painted by [[Jan Van Eyck]], in [[Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent]], [[Belgium]] revealed the structure and details of the large altarpiece‚Äôs painting scheme. The complete radiography of the [[altarpiece]] was conducted between 2010 and 2011 as part of a project largely funded by the [[J. Paul Getty Trust|Getty Institute]]. The x-rays and other technical information that was gathered were used to prepare conservation treatments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://closertovaneyck.kikirpa.be/#viewer/id1=40&amp;id2=0 Closer to Van Eyck: Rediscovering the Ghent Altarpiece (2011).

The Sampling Officials of the Amsterdam Drapers‚Äô Guild, also known as the [[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild]] or more simply as the Syndics, was painted by [[Rembrandt]] in 1662. An x-ray of the painting revealed that Rembrandt fine-tuned the composition several times, alternating the glances between the figures and slightly changing their positions before he settled on that is known today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Late Rembrandt - The Syndics, 1662|url = http://kpnrijksmuseum.com/destaalmeesters|website = KPN Late Rembrandt|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

X-ray analysis revealed alterations to the paint of a sixteenth century portrait that had been identified as a [[Bronzino]] portrait of [[Eleanor of Toledo]] at the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].

[[The Old Guitarist]] by [[Pablo Picasso]] at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] had been previously examined with visible and ultraviolet light, which had hinted at the possibility of an earlier composition. X-rays of the painting revealed that Picasso had originally painted two female figures behind the guitarist.

X-rays can provide a better picture of [[plaster casts]] and other works that rely on internal supports. However, size and mobility can often affect whether or not radiography is an option for sculptural works. X-rays can also identify cracks and previous repairs to [[glass]] and [[ceramic]] materials, which is important for assessing the condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/xray.html Pigments through the Ages: X-rays.

In the x-rays of a wooden power figure at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], conservators discovered that there were hollowed out sections through the center of the sculpture that connected three filled cavities. Information about the network inside of these sculptures has aided curators as they research the function of these pieces. The findings have led to the use of radiography to compare power figures in other collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.imamuseum.org/about/ima-magazine/spring-2010|title = The Songye X-ray Project|date = Spring 2010|accessdate = |website = IMA Magazine|publisher = [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For other textiles X-rays can also provide conservators with information about [[dyes]] since metallic mordant has historically been used in the dye making process. Details about stitching patterns can also appear on x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/research-journal/issue-03/x-radiography-as-a-tool-to-examine-the-making-and-remaking-of-historic-quilts/ Hackett, J.

=== Implementation ===
X-rays have been employed to analyze what is under the wrappings of [[mummies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab/tag/x-radiography/ Gleeson, M. (2015). Animal mummy x-rays. Retrieved from The Penn Artifact Lab.]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing images of the bones within, x-rays have revealed the location of jewelry and other objects that were buried with the body without disturbing the wrappings.

The [[Herculaneum papyri]] that survived the [[Vesuvius]] disaster were excavated and researchers have used x-rays to read their contents. Previous methods involved slowly unrolling the [[papyrus]], which damaged much of the [[scrolls]], some beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150120-roman-scrolls-xray-archeology-science/ Vergano, D. (2015). X-rays reveal snippets from papyrus scrolls that survived Mount Vesuvius. Retrieved from The National Geographic]&lt;/ref&gt;

X-ray technology was used to quickly identify individual [[coins]] uncovered in a single container. Researchers did not have to wait for slower, traditional conservation methods to separate and decipher the coins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/09/x-rays-reveal-secrets-roman-coins Kennedy, M. (2012). X-rays reveal secrets of Roman coins. Retrieved from ''The Guardian''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

X-rays were among the imaging techniques used to uncover lost text on the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]], which is in the collection of the Walters Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. The museum spearheaded an extensive research project on the palimpsest that employed various imaging techniques including ultraviolet, infrared, and x-radiography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archimedespalimpsest.org/about/imaging/xray-flourescence.php The Archimedes Palimpsest: A-ray fluorescence imaging (n.d.). Retrieved from archimedespalimpsest.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The heavily corroded [[Antikythera mechanism]], which was uncovered from a shipwreck at the beginning of the 20th century, has been x-rayed several times in an effort to understand how it works.

The '''Reynolds Equation''' is a partial differential equation governing the pressure distribution of thin viscous fluid films in [[Lubrication theory]]. It should not be confused with [[Osborne Reynolds]]' other namesakes, [[Reynolds number]] and [[Reynolds-averaged Navier‚ÄìStokes equations]]. It was first derived by Osborne Reynolds in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, O. 1886. On the Theory of Lubrication and Its Application to Mr. Beauchamp Tower's Experiments, Including an Experimental Determination of the Viscosity of Olive Oil. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London''.[https://archive.org/details/philtrans08214427]&lt;/ref&gt; The classical Reynolds Equation can be used to describe the pressure distribution in nearly any type of [[fluid bearing|fluid film bearing]]; a bearing type in which the bounding bodies are fully separated by a thin layer of liquid or gas.

==General usage==
The general Reynolds equation is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\rho h^3}{12\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\rho h^3}{12\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}\right)=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\rho h \left( u_a + u_b \right)}{2}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\rho h \left( v_a + v_b \right)}{2}\right)+\rho\left(w_a-w_b\right)-\rho u_a\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} - \rho v_a \frac{\partial h}{\partial y}+h\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is fluid film pressure.
*&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are the bearing width and length coordinates.
*&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is fluid film thickness coordinate.
*&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is fluid film thickness.
*&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is fluid viscosity.
*&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is fluid density.
*&lt;math&gt;u, v, w&lt;/math&gt; are the bounding body velocities in &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt; respectively.
*&lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; are subscripts denoting the top and bottom bounding bodies respectively.

The equation can either be used with consistent units or [[Nondimensionalization|nondimensionalized]].

The Reynolds Equation assumes:
*The fluid is [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]].
*Fluid viscous forces dominate over fluid inertia forces. This is the principal of the [[Reynolds number]]. 
*Fluid body forces are negligible.
*The variation of pressure across the fluid film is negligibly small (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} = 0&lt;/math&gt;)
*The fluid film thickness is much less than the width and length and thus curvature effects are negligible. (i.e. &lt;math&gt;h \ll l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h \ll w&lt;/math&gt;).

For some simple bearing geometries and boundary conditions, the Reynolds equation can be solved analytically. Often however, the equation must be solved numerically. Frequently this involves [[Discretization|discretizing]] the geometric domain, and then applying a finite technique - often [[Finite difference method|FDM]], [[Finite volume method|FVM]], or [[Finite element method|FEM]].

==Derivation from Navier-Stokes==
A full derivation of the Reynolds Equation from the [[Navier‚ÄìStokes equations|Navier-Stokes equation]] can be found in numerous lubrication text books.&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Fluid Film Lubrication. Hamrock, B., Schmid, S., Jacobson. B. 2nd Edition. 2004. {{ISBN|0-8247-5371-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fluid Film Lubrication. Szeri, A. 2nd Edition. 2010. {{ISBN|0521898234}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solution of Reynolds Equation ==
In general, Reynolds equation has to be solved using numerical methods such as finite difference, or finite element. In certain simplified cases, however, analytical or approximate solutions can be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tribonet.org/wiki/reynolds-equation/|title=Reynolds Equation|last=tribonet|date=2016-11-12|newspaper=tribonet|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the case of rigid sphere on flat geometry, steady-state case and  half-Sommerfeld cavitation boundary condition, the 2-D Reynolds equation can be solved analytically. This solution was proposed by a Nobel Prize winner [[Pyotr Kapitsa|Professor Kapitza]]. Half-Sommerfeld boundary condition was shown to be inaccurate and this solution has to be used with care.

In case of 1-D Reynolds equation several analytical or semi-analytical solutions are available. In 1916 Martin obtained a [http://www.tribonet.org/cmdownloads/analytical-solution-of-1d-reynolds-equation/ closed form solution] for a minimum film thickness and pressure for a rigid cylinder and plane geometry. This solution is not accurate for the cases when the elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes considerably to the film thickness. In 1949, Grubin obtained [http://www.tribonet.org/cmdownloads/semi-analytical-solution-of-1d-transient-reynolds-equationgrubins-approximation/ an approximate solution] for so called elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) line contact problem, where he combined both elastic deformation and lubricant hydrodynamic flow. In this solution it was assumed that the pressure profile follows [[Contact mechanics|Hertz solution]]. The model is therefore accurate at high loads, when the hydrodynamic pressure tends to be close to the [http://www.tribonet.org/cmdownloads/hertz-contact-calculator/ Hertz contact pressure].

==Applications==
The Reynolds equation is used to model the pressure in many applications. For example:
* [[Ball bearings]]
* [[Air bearings]]
* [[Journal bearings]]
* Squeeze film dampers in aircraft gas turbines
* Human hip and knee joints
* Lubricated gear contacts

==Reynolds Equation Adaptations==
In 1978 Patir and Cheng introduced an average flow model&lt;ref&gt;Patir, N. and Cheng, H.S. 1978. An Average Flow Model for Determining Effects of Three-Dimensional Roughness on Partial Hydrodynamic Lubrication. ''Journal of Lubrication Technology,'' Vol. 100, No. 1, pp. 12-17. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.3453103]&lt;/ref&gt; which modifies the Reynolds equation to consider the effects of [[Asperity (materials science)|surface roughness]] on partially lubricated contacts.

'''Sirarpie Der Nersessian''' (5 September 1896{{spaced ndash}}5 July 1989) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[art historian]], who specialized in [[Armenian studies|Armenian]] and [[Byzantine studies]]. Der Nersessian was a renowned academic and a pioneer in [[Armenian art]] history. She taught at several institutions in the [[United States]], including [[Wellesley College]] in Massachusetts and as [[Henri Focillon]] Professor of Art and Archaeology at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Dickran Kouymjian|last=Kouymjian|first=Dickran|contribution=Sirarpie Der Nersessian (1896-1989): Pioneer of Armenian Art History|title=Medievalists and the Academy|editor=Jane Chance|location=Madison|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=2005|p=483|ISBN=0-299-20750-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DumbartonOaks&gt;{{cite journal|author=Allen, Jelisaveta, Nina G.

Der Nersessian was also a member of several international institutions such as the [[British Academy]] (1975), the [[Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] (1978) and the [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]] (1966).&lt;ref name=DumbartonOaks/&gt;

==Biography==

===Education===
Der Nersessian was born the youngest of three children in [[Constantinople]] in 1896. She came from a well-to-do family and her maternal uncle happened to be the [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Malachia Ormanian]].&lt;ref name=DumbartonOaks/&gt; Her parents died while she was still young: her mother Akabi, when she was nine, and her father Mihran, when she was eighteen.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|contribution=Sirarpie Der Nersessian|url=http://arthistorians.info/dernersessians|publisher=[[Dictionary of Art Historians]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from Yesayan Parochial School and the English High School in Constantinople, gaining fluency in Armenian, English and French at an early age. In 1915, during the height of the [[Armenian Genocide]], Der Nersessian and her sister Arax (by then orphans) were forced to leave for Europe, where they took up residence in [[Geneva]]. Der Nersessian studied at the [[University of Geneva]] for several years until settling in [[Paris, France]] in 1919.&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{cite book|language=hy|authorlink=Levon Chookaszian|last=Chookaszian|first=Levon|contribution=’è’•÷Ä-’Ü’•÷Ä’Ω’•’Ω’µ’°’∂, ’ç’´÷Ä’°÷Ä÷É’´ ’Ñ’´’∞÷Ä’°’∂ [Ter Nersesyan, Sirarpi Mihrani]|title=[[Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]]|volume=11|location=Yerevan|publisher=Armenian Encyclopedia|year=1985|p=683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Der Nersessian was admitted to [[Sorbonne University]], studying history at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes de l'universit√© de Paris. She studied under the notable [[Byzantine studies|Byzantinologist]]s [[Charles Diehl]] and [[Gabriel Millet]] and art historian [[Henri Focillon]].&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; In 1922, she became Millet's assistant, and with his help, published one of her first articles in 1929.&lt;ref name=DumbartonOaks/&gt; The two theses (graduates students then had to submit two theses) that she presented for her ''doctorat d'etat'', "L'illustration du roman de Barlaam et Joasaph" and a paper on Armenian illuminated manuscripts during the late medieval period,&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; were well-received (earning a ''Mention tr√®s honorable''), and both of them were awarded with prizes by the [[Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] and ''Revue des √âtudes Grecques'' when they were published in 1937.

===Professor and pioneer===
In 1930, Der Nersessian moved to the [[United States]] at the suggestion of her three mentors, Byzantinists [[Charles Rufus Morey]], Albert M. Friend Jr., and Walter Cook, becoming a part-time lecturer at [[Wellesley College]] in [[Massachusetts]]. She taught art history at Wellesley, quickly gaining a full professorship and later becoming the chairwoman of the Department of Art History and Director of Farnsworth Museum.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; Der Nersessian was the first woman to teach Byzantine art at a woman‚Äôs college, the first woman to be decorated with the medal of Saint Gregory the Illuminator by His Holiness Catholicos [[Vazgen I]] in 1960, the first woman invited to lecture at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris, the only woman in her time to gain full professorship at Dumbarton Oaks, and the second woman to be honored with a gold medal from the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Kouymjian. "Sirarpie Der Nersessian", pp. 482-493.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, she received the Achievement Award from the [[American Association of University Women]].

Der Nersessian remained at Dumbarton Oaks until 1978, when she retired to France and lived with her sister in Paris.&lt;ref name=DumbartonOaks/&gt; Upon retirement, she had her entire library shipped to the [[Matenadaran]] in [[Yerevan]], so as to better help Armenian scholars in their studies. Shortly after her death in 1989, an endowment fund for prospective art history students in Armenia, Fonds Sirarpie Der Neressian at the Institut de Recherches sur les Miniatures Arm√©no-Byzantines, was created in her honor.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

==Bibliography==
Der Nersessian's work primarily concerned Armenian art history, including the study of  [[church architecture]], [[illuminated manuscripts]], [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and [[sculpture]]. Below is a partial list of books and articles that she authored.&lt;ref&gt;For a more comprehensive list, see: Dumbarton Oaks Papers. "Sirarpie Der Nersessian." ''Dumbarton Oaks''.

[[File:StephaneLupasco.jpg|thumb|St√©phane Lupasco]]
'''St√©phane Lupasco''' (born '''≈ûtefan Lupa≈ücu'''; 11 August 1900 ‚Äì 7 October 1988) was a [[Romania]]n [[philosopher]] who developed [[non-Aristotelian logic]].

==Early years==
St√©phane Lupasco was born in [[Bucharest]] on 11 August 1900. His family belonged to the old [[Moldavia]]n [[aristocracy]]. His father was a lawyer and politician, but it was his mother, a pianist and student of [[C√©sar Franck]], who established the family in [[Paris]] in 1916. After high school at the [[Lyc√©e Buffon]], he studied [[philosophy]], [[biology]] and [[physics]] at the [[Sorbonne]] and, briefly, [[law]]. He participated fully in the artistic and intellectual life of Paris in the 20s and 30s and defended his State Doctoral Thesis in 1935.

==Academic career==
In 1946, he was named Research Assistant at the [[French National Science Research Centre]], a post he was obliged to leave ten years later because of the inability of the Centre to decide in which Scientific Section his work belonged! The next ten or fifteen years were those of greatest acceptance of his work by the public and other thinkers, but unfortunately not by mainstream logicians and philosophers. His ''Trois Mati√®res'', published in 1960 was a bestseller, and people began calling Lupasco the [[Descartes]], the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], the [[Hegel]] of the 20th Century, a new [[Claude Bernard]], a new [[Bergson]], etc. He continued to publish books in the 70s and 80s, the last being ''L‚ÄôHomme et ses Trois Ethiques'' in 1986, two years before his death on October 7, 1988 in Paris. An Award of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1984 was among the few honors that came to Lupasco during his lifetime. Lupasco was one of the founding members of the International Center for Transdisciplinary Research (Centre International de Recherches et Etudes Transdisciplinaires (CIRET)), founded in Paris in 1987 by [[Basarab Nicolescu]], [[Edgar Morin]], [[Ren√© Berger]], [[Michel Random]] and other key figures of the French intelligentsia. As Nicolescu has recalled, Lupasco was deeply affected by the stubborn resistance of the academic community to honest debate and discussion of his new principles and postulates, and it is with an understandable bitterness that Lupasco saw in this resistance another example of the operation of his principles.

==Summary of work==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2011}}
Lupasco‚Äôs style as an author is not an easy one, and requires the uninterrupted attention of the reader. It is not infrequent to find sentences of almost a page in length, containing multiply nested clauses. His writing is extremely dense in terms of the ideas and meaning of each successive phrase, with only occasional illustrative examples. Lupasco makes many references to his prior publications, unfortunately, often without adequate indexation. As Nicolescu has remarked, Lupasco‚Äôs exclusion from French academic life had both advantages and disadvantages: Lupasco was freed from the constraints of teaching and publication of research papers in a rigid format, and he obviously did not find it necessary to apply the discipline of providing references to his sources. In the ''Psychic Universe'', published when Lupasco was seventy-nine, one sees nothing about current work in psychiatry. (Lupasco unfortunately did not read English well, and hence no references to the ‚Äúanti‚Äù-psychiatry of [[R. D. Laing]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], close in spirit to his work, are to be found.) A recent study by Brenner (2008) up-dates Lupasco‚Äôs work and shows its relevance to current issues in science and philosophy, as well as logic.

==Influence==
Lupasco was not well served by the (few) exegetes that had looked closely at his work. Only one book, by the sociologist [[Marc Beigbeder]], presents both a substantial description of Lupasco‚Äôs theory and development of it as a ‚Äúlogic of society‚Äù. A brief monograph by the philosopher [[Benjamin Fondane]], dating from 1944 (just prior to his deportation and death) and published in 1998, discusses the limitations of Lupasco‚Äôs view of [[affectivity]] and [[ontology]]. A book by an obscure English artist, [[George Melhuish]], uses Lupasco‚Äôs ideas to develop his own concept of the structure of the universe, a sympathetic but not very rigorous reading of his work. Aside from Nicolescu's personal library it has been claimed that access to these and several other texts  are otherwise unavailable. A complete understanding of, for example, Lupasco‚Äôs analysis of those precursors that [[Andr√© Glucksmann]] has called ‚ÄúLes Ma√Ætres Penseurs‚Äù ‚Äì [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Marx]] ‚Äì must be sought in several different books. The attention of the reader is rewarded, however, by Lupasco‚Äôs regular restatements of his basic theses, often in a way that is more economic, meaningful and coherent.

In his introduction to Lupasco‚Äôs ''The Principle of Antagonism and the Logic of Energy'', Nicolescu points out that once the reader gets beyond the (relatively few) mathematical formulas in this book, Lupasco‚Äôs language is perfectly accessible. ‚ÄúIt exemplifies, in a self-referential manner, the ternary aspects of actualization, potentialization and included middle which give it the charm and the privilege of incantations that are at the same time scientific, philosophical and poetic.‚Äù

Summarizing briefly, stimulated by [[Einstein]]'s works and [[quantum]] theory, Lupasco founded a new [[logic]], questioning the ''[[tertium non datur]]'' principle of classical logic. He introduced a third state, going beyond the [[String duality|duality]] principle, the T-state. The T-state is  neither 'actual', nor 'potential' (categories replacing in Lupasco's system the 'true' or 'false' values of standard bivalent logic), but a resolution of the two contradictory elements at a higher level of reality or complexity. Lupasco generalised his logic to [[physics]] and [[epistemology]] and above all to a new theory of [[consciousness]].

==Recent studies==
A key reference in French is the compendium of 1999, "St√©phane Lupasco -The Man and the Work" by H. Badescu and B. Nicolescu. The first comprehensive update and comparison of Lupasco's thought in English is the 2008 book by J. E. Brenner, "Logic in Reality". Other useful new references are the combined papers of a Symposium on Lupasco in 2009 "At the Confluence of Two Cultures: Lupasco Today," in French and a biographical paper by Brenner, "The Philosophical Logic of St√©phane Lupasco (1900 - 1988)" in English.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1940">In [[computability theory]], the '''{{Abbr|UTM|universal Turing Machine}} theorem''', or '''[[universal Turing machine]] theorem''', is a basic result about [[G√∂del numbering]]s of the set of [[computable function]]s. It affirms the existence of a computable '''universal function''', which is capable of calculating any other computable function (Rogers 1967:22). The universal function is an abstract version of the [[universal Turing machine]], thus the name of the theorem. 

[[Roger's equivalence theorem]] provides a characterization of the G√∂del numbering of the computable functions in terms of the [[smn theorem|''s&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;'' theorem]] and the UTM theorem.

== The UTM theorem ==

The UTM theorem states that there is a [[Partial function|partial]] [[computable function]] ''u'' of two variables such that, for every computable function ''f'' of one variable, there is an ''e'' such that 
&lt;math&gt;f(x) \simeq u(e,x)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x''.  This means that, for each ''x'', either ''f''(''x'') and ''u''(''e'',''x'') are both defined and are equal, or are both undefined (Soare 1987: 15).  

The theorem thus shows that, defining &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') as ''u''(''e'', ''x''), the sequence &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip; is an enumeration of the partial computable functions.  The function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in the statement of the theorem is called a '''universal function'''.

'''Unresolved complex mixture''' (also UCM or hump) is a feature frequently observed in [[Gas chromatography|gas chromatographic]] (GC) data of crude oils and extracts from organisms exposed to oil.&lt;ref name="Gough"&gt;Gough, M. A. &amp; Rowland, S. J. Characterization of Unresolved Complex-Mixtures of Hydrocarbons in Petroleum. Nature 344, 648-650 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the UCM hump appearance is that GC cannot resolve and identify a significant part of the hydrocarbons in crude oils. The resolved components appear as peaks while the UCM appears as a large background/platform. In non-biodegraded oils the UCM may comprise less than 50% of the total area of the chromatogram, while in biodegraded oils this figure can rise to over 90%. UCMs are also observed in certain refined fractions such as lubricating oils &lt;ref name="Gough" /&gt; and references therein.

One reason why it is important to study the nature of UCMs is that some have been shown to contain toxic components,&lt;ref name="Rowland"&gt;Rowland, S., Donkin, P., Smith, E. &amp; Wraige, E.

Analysis of the hydrocarbon fraction of crude oils by gas chromatography (GC) reveals a complex mixture containing many thousands of individual components.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, P. A., Lewis, C. A. &amp; Rowland, S. J. Isolation of individual hydrocarbons from the unresolved complex hydrocarbon mixture of a biodegraded crude oil using preparative capillary gas chromatography. Organic Geochemistry 36, 963-970 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Components that are resolved by GC have been extensively studied e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Killops, S. D. &amp; Killops, V. J. An introduction to organic geochemistry (Longman, Harlow, England, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, despite the application of many analytical techniques the remaining components have, until very recently, proved difficult to separate due to the large numbers of co-eluting compounds.  Gas chromatograms of mature oils have prominent n-alkane peaks which distract attention from the underlying unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons often referred to as the ‚Äòhump‚Äô. Processes such as weathering and biodegradation result in a relative enrichment of the UCM component by removal of resolved components and the creation of new compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, K. E., Walters, C. C. &amp; Moldowan, J. M. The biomarker guide: Volume 1, Biomarkers and Isotopes in the Environment and Human History (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been shown that both resolved and unresolved components of oils are subject to concurrent biodegradation,&lt;ref name="Gough" /&gt; i.e. it is not a sequential process, but due to the recalcitrant nature of some components, the rates of biodegradation of individual compounds greatly varies.  The UCM fraction often represents the major component of hydrocarbons within hydrocarbon-polluted sediments &lt;ref name="ScarlettA" /&gt; (see reference therein) and biota e.g.&lt;ref name="Rowland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Donkin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, S.

Biogeochemical assessment of waters, sediments, soils and biota.

==Weathering and biodegradion of oils within the marine environment==
Environmental UCMs result from highly degraded petroleum hydrocarbons and once formed they can stay largely unchanged in sediments for many years.  For example, in 1969 a diesel oil spill contaminated saltmarsh sediment within Wild Harbor River, US; by 1973 only a baseline hump was observed, which remained largely unchanged within the anaerobic sediment for 30.&lt;ref name="Reddy"&gt;Reddy, C. M. et al. The West Falmouth oil spill after thirty years: the persistence of petroleum hydrocarbons in marsh sediments. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 36, 4754-4760 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  In a study of the potential for UCM-dominated oil to be further degraded, it was concluded that even using bacteria specifically adapted for complex UCM hydrocarbons in conjunction with nutrient enrichment, biodegradation rates would still be relatively slow.&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, E. (Marine Institute Fisheries Research Centre, Dublin, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  Bacterial degradation of hydrocarbons is complex and will depend on environmental conditions (e.g. aerobic or anaerobic, temperature, nutrient availability, available species of bacteria etc.).

==Analysis of UCM hydrocarbons==
A relatively recent analytical tool that has been used for the separation of UCMs is comprehensive two-dimensional GC [[GCxGC|(GC√óGC)]]
.  This powerful technique, introduced by Liu and Phillips &lt;ref&gt;Liu, Z. Y. &amp; Phillips, J. B. Comprehensive 2-Dimensional Gas-Chromatography Using an on-Column Thermal Modulator Interface. Journal of Chromatographic Science 29, 227-231 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; combines two GC columns with different separation mechanisms: typically a  primary column that separates compounds based on volatility coupled to a second short column that separates by polarity.  The two columns are connected by a modulator, a device that traps, focuses and re-injects the peaks that elute from the first column into the second column.  Each peak eluting from the first column (which may be a number of co-eluting peaks) is further separated on the second column.  The second separation is rapid, allowing the introduction of subsequent fractions from the first column without mutual interference.  Dall√ºge et al.&lt;ref&gt;Dall√ºge, J., Beens, J. &amp; Brinkman, U. A. T. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography: a powerful and versatile analytical tool. Journal of Chromatography A 1000, 69-108 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed the principles, advantages and main characteristics of this technique.  One of the main advantages is the very high separation power, making the technique ideal for unravelling the composition of complex mixtures. Another important feature of GC√óGC is that chemically related compounds show up as ordered structures within the chromatograms, i.e. isomers appear as distinct groups in the chromatogram as a result of their similar interaction with the second dimension column phase.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, J. B. &amp; Beens, J. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography: a hyphenated method with strong coupling between the two dimensions. Journal of Chromatography A 856, 331-347 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of GC√óGC for the characterization of complex petrochemical mixtures has been extensively reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;Adahchour, M., Beens, J., Vreuls, R. J. J. &amp; Brinkman, U. A. T. Recent developments in comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) III. Applications for petrochemicals and organohalogens. Trac-Trends in Analytical Chemistry 25, 726-741 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;   Most research into petrochemical hydrocarbons using GC√óGC has utilised [[Flame ionization detector|flame ionisation detection]] (FID) but [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) is necessary to obtain the structural information necessary to identify unknown compounds. Currently, only [[Time-of-flight mass spectrometry|time-of-flight MS]] (ToF-MS) can deliver the high acquisition rates required to analyse GC√óGC.

==Toxicity of UCM hydrocarbon components==
There is compelling evidence that components within some UCMs are toxic to marine organisms. The clearance rate (also known as feeding feed) of mussels was reduced by 40% following exposure to a monoaromatic UCM derived from a Norwegian crude oil.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; The toxicity of monoaromatic UCM components was further evidenced by an elegant set of experiments using transplantations of clean and polluted mussels.&lt;ref name="Donkin" /&gt; Recent analysis by GC√óGC-ToF-MS of UCMs extracted from the mussel tissues, has shown that they contain a vast array of both known and unknown compounds.&lt;ref name="BoothA" /&gt; The comparative analysis of UCMs extracted from mussels known to possess high, moderate and low Scope for Growth (SfG), a measure of the capacity for growth and reproduction,&lt;ref&gt;Widdows, J. et al.  Measurement of stress effects (scope for growth) and contaminant levels in mussels (Mytilus edulis) collected from the Irish Sea. Marine Environmental Research 53, 327-356 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that branched alkylbenzenes represented the largest structural class within the UCM of mussels with low SfG; also, branched isomers of alkyltetralins, alkylindans and alkylindenes were prominent in the stressed mussels.&lt;ref name="BoothA" /&gt; Laboratory toxicity tests using both commercially available and specially synthesised compounds revealed that such branched alkylated structures were capable of producing the observed poor health of the mussels.&lt;ref name="BoothA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoothB" /&gt; The reversible effects observed in mussels following exposure to the UCM hydrocarbons identified to date are consistent with non-specific narcosis (also known as baseline) mode of action of toxicity.&lt;ref name="ScarlettB" /&gt; There is no evidence that toxic UCM components can biomagnify through the food chain. Crabs (Carcinus maenas) that were fed a diet of mussels contaminated with environmentally realistic concentrations of branched alkylbenzenes, suffered behavioural disruption but only a small concentration of the compounds were retained in the midgut of the crabs.&lt;ref name="ScarlettC" /&gt; Within marsh sediments still contaminated with high concentrations of UCM hydrocarbons from the Florida barge oil spill in 1969 (see above,) the behaviour and feeding of  fiddler crabs (Uca pugnax) was reported to be affected.&lt;ref&gt;Culbertson, J. B. et al. Long-term biological effects of petroleum residues on fiddler crabs in salt marshes. Marine Pollution Bulletin 54, 955-962 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polar UCMs==
Much of the past research into the composition and toxicity of UCM hydrocarbons has been conducted by the [http://www.research.plymouth.ac.uk/pegg/  Petroleum and Environmental Geochemistry Group (PEGG)] at the University of Plymouth, UK. As well as the hydrocarbon UCM, oils also contain more polar compounds such as those containing oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen. These compounds can be very soluble in water and hence bioavailable to marine and aquatic organisms. Polar UCMs are present within produced waters from oil rigs and from oil sands processing. A polar UCM fraction extracted from North Sea oil produced water was reported to elicit hormonal disruption by way of both estrogen receptor agonist and androgen receptor agonist activity.&lt;ref name="Tollefsen" /&gt; Ongoing concern regarding the potential toxicity of components within [[Athabasca oil sands|Athabasca Oil Sands]] (Canada) tailings ponds has highlighted the need for identification of the compounds present. Until recently, such positive identification of individual so-called [[naphthenic acid]]s  from oil sands produced waters had so far eluded characterisation but recent research by PEGG presented at a SETAC conference in 2010 &lt;ref&gt;Rowland, S. J. in SETAC North America 31st Annual Meeting, Portland, U.S.A., 7‚Äì11 November 2010 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that, using a new GCxGC-TOF-MS, it was possible to resolve and identify a range of new compounds within such highly complex extracts. One group of compounds found to be present were tricyclic diamondoid acids.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland SJ, Scarlett AG, Jones D, West CE, Frank RA. Diamonds in the Rough: Identification of Individual Naphthenic Acids in Oil Sands Process Water. Environ Sci Technol: In Press, {{doi|10.1021/es103721b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These structures had previously not even been considered as naphthenic acids and  suggests an unprecedented degree of biodegradation of some of the oil in the oil sands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19534">In [[science fiction]], '''uplift''' is a developmental process to transform a certain species of animals into more intelligent beings by other, already-intelligent beings. This is usually accomplished by cultural, technological, or evolutional interventions like [[Genetic engineering in science fiction|genetic engineering]] but any fictional or real process can be used. The earliest appearance of the concept is in [[H. G. Wells]]' 1896 novel ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Booker|first1=Keith M.|title=Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction in Literature|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently appears in [[David Brin]]'s ''[[Uplift Universe|Uplift series]]'' and other science fiction works.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JXnz9x9sO4C&amp;pg=PA850 |title=The Greenwood encyclopedia of science fiction and fantasy |volume=2 |author=David Langford |chapter=Uplift}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
The concept can be traced to [[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'' (1896),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://web.syr.edu/~blbousfi/UPLIFTEX22.html FROM THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU TO LIVES OF THE MONSTER DOGS: UPLIFTED ANIMALS, WISH FULFILLMENT, AND ORIGINAL SIN &lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at web.syr.edu  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111202414/http://web.syr.edu/~blbousfi/UPLIFTEX22.html|date=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the titular scientist transforms animals into horrifying parodies of humans through surgery and psychological torment. The resulting animal-people obsessively recite the Law, a series of prohibitions against reversion to animal behaviors, with the haunting refrain of "Are we not men?" Wells' novel reflects Victorian concerns about [[vivisection]] and of the power of unrestrained scientific experimentation to do terrible harm.

Other early literary examples can be found in the following works:
* [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s "Johnny Black" stories (beginning with "[[The Command (short story)|The Command]]") about a black bear raised to human-level intelligence, published in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]'' from 1938-1940. 
* [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Sirius (novel)|Sirius]]'' (1944) explores a dog with human intelligence. 
* In [[Cordwainer Smith]]'s ''[[Instrumentality of Mankind]]'' series "underpeople" are created from animals through unexplained technological means explicitly to be servants of humanity, and were often treated as less than slaves by the society that used them, until the laws were reformed in the story ''[[The Ballad of Lost C'Mell]]'' (1962). However, Smith's characterizations of individual underpeople are frequently quite sympathetic, and one of his most memorable characters is C'Mell, the cat-woman who appears in ''[[The Ballad of Lost C'Mell]]'' and in ''[[Norstrilia]]'' (1975).

David Brin has stated that his [[Uplift Universe]] was written at least in part in response to the common assumption in earlier science fiction such as Smith's work and ''[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|Planet of the Apes]]'' that uplifted animals would, or even should, be treated as possessions rather than people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090325125822/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue25/interview.html David Brin&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.scifi.com&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a significant part of the conflict in the series revolves around the differing policies of Galactics and humans toward their client races. Galactic races traditionally hold their uplifted "clients" in a hundred-millennium-long [[indenture]], during which the "patrons" have extensive rights and claims over clients' lives and labor power. In contrast, humans have given their uplifted [[dolphin]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s near-equal [[civil rights]], with a few legal and economic disabilities related to their unfinished state.  A key scene in ''[[Startide Rising]]'' is a discussion between a self-aware computer (the Niss) and a leading human (Gillian) about how the events during their venture (and hence the novel's plot) relate to the morality of the Galactics' system of uplift.

'''Women's Studies Resource Centre''' is a [[feminist]] [[library]] in [[Adelaide, South Australia]] specialising in resources about women for the education sector: primary and secondary school students and teachers, tertiary students and staff at [[Technical and Further Education]] (TAFE) and University, and the general community.

==History==
The centre began as a result of the first national conference on ''Sexism in Education'' in 1973 convened by the [[Women's Liberation Movement]] and subsequent [[Women's Studies]] courses that were established at [[Flinders University|Flinders]] and [[Adelaide University|Adelaide Universities]].

The Education Department held a conference entitled Women in Education, reflecting its concern with the position of women and girls in our society.

Teachers and students involved in the new Women's Studies courses quickly became aware of the shortage of resources for their needs. A group of women from various fields of education began meeting in 1974 with the aim of developing a Women's Studies curriculum for secondary schools and bringing together the resources necessary for such a course.

With a grant from the Australian National Advisory Committee for [[International Women's Year]], the Women's Studies Resource Centre was established in July 1975, celebrating its 30th year in 2005 and continues today.

The centre and its collection has been located at Wattle Park Teachers centre, Adelaide Girls High School in Grote Street, above the Women's Information Switchboard in Kintore Avenue, the Liverpool Building in Flinders Street and is currently located at 64 Pennington Terrace, North Adelaide.

==Collection==
It houses a comprehensive feminist collection of 17,000 items, including the Women's Liberation archives and provides collating room for 'Liberation' the Adelaide Women's Liberation newsletter, who the ''Oxford Australian Feminism: a companion'', has termed "one of the liveliest women's liberation groups in the country".

The collection includes records from a number of Australian women's groups, including the [[Women's Electoral Lobby]], a national lobbying group established in 1972, and issue specific groups such as Women Against Nuclear Energy, Women‚Äôs Abortion Action Campaign, and Women‚Äôs Action Against Global Violence.[http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE1033b.htm]

[[Image:Xilo99b.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Xiloteque Manuel Soler, in [[D√©nia]] ([[Spain]])]]
A '''xylotheque''' or '''xylothek''' (from the Greek ''xylon'' for "wood" and "theque" meaning "repository") is special form of [[herbarium]] that consists of a collection of authenticated wood specimens.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt; It is also known as a  '''xylarium''' (from the Greek ''xylon'' for "wood" and Latin "arium" meaning "separate place"). Traditionally, xylotheque specimens were in the form of book-shaped volumes, each made of a particular kind of wood and holding samples of the different parts of the corresponding plant. While the terms are often used interchangeably, some use ''xylotheque'' to refer to these older collections of wooden 'books' and ''xylarium'' for modern collections in which some or all of the specimens are in simpler shapes, such as blocks or plaques with information engraved on their surfaces.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt; Many countries have at least one xylotheque with native [[flora]], and some also house flora from other parts of the world. They are valuable to specialists in forestry, botany, conservation, forensics, art restoration, [[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], and other fields.&lt;ref name=kerala/&gt;

==History==
Xylotheques date back to the later 17th century, when wood specimens began to appear in [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosity]].&lt;ref name=Lovejoy/&gt; Over time, they grew larger and more systematic, with hundreds of individual volumes in a single collection. The oldest extant collection was established in 1823 at the University of Leningrad, and by the middle of the century they had been established in many European countries.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lovejoy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Queensland/&gt; Australia now houses 12 xylaria holding 11% of the world's wood specimens,&lt;ref name=Queensland/&gt; while the Oxford Forestry Institute's xylarium holds about 13%.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt;

In older xylotheques, the wooden volumes were typically made out of the same wood as the specimens inside and sometimes decorated with tree bark and associated lichens and mosses.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy/&gt; Each volume housed seeds, flowers, twigs, and leaves from the corresponding tree or bush, along with a written description hidden in a small compartment set into the inner spine. An alternative form of xylotheque found in Japan and elsewhere featured paintings of the plant parts rather than actual field specimens.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy/&gt;  

Even a modest collection of wood samples has value, as each of its samples has a particular history. Xylotheques provide comparison samples for [[xylotomy]], art historical studies, and scientific studies of the physical and [[mechanics|mechanical]] properties of wood, such as durability and preservation. Xylotheques are also useful for anyone who needs to make a morphological-visual analysis of wood.

The xylotheque with the largest number of samples is the [[Samuel James Record]] Collection in the United States, which holds 98,000 samples. Formerly housed at the Forestry School of [[Yale University]] in New Haven, Connecticut, it was transferred to the U.S. Forest Service's Forest Products Laboratory in 1969.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=FPL/&gt; The second largest xylotheque belongs to the [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]] in [[Tervuren]], Belgium, with 57,000 samples.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt; The Th√ºnen Institute of Wood Research in [[Hamburg]] has more than 37,000 samples.&lt;ref name=thuenen/&gt;
