'''Activprimary''' is a [[software]] application designed specifically for teachers and children in the primary education sector who use an Activboard [[Interactive Whiteboard]], Promethean's '''''Interactive Whiteboard'''''. Activprimary was designed and implemented by [https://archive.is/20121128065750/http://uk.linkedin.com/in/nigelpearce Nigel Pearce] together with a software development team at [[Promethean Ltd|Promethean]] ([[Blackburn]], [[England]]). Activprimary is similar in functionality to the software application [[Activstudio]] but is designed with a simpler user interface aimed towards the younger learner.

==History==
*Version 1 was released in January 2004.
*Activprimary won the [http://www.worlddidac.org/ Worlddidac] award for Software Innovation in 2004 and again in 2006.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;WorldDidac, http://www.worlddidac.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=promawards&gt;Promethean Awards,http://www.prometheanworld.com/server.php?show=nav.21199&lt;/ref&gt;
*Version 2 was released in January 2005.
*Activprimary 2 won Best Education Technology Solution for Productivity/Creativity at The Software &amp; Information Industry Association’s (SIIA) 23rd Annual CODIE awards in 2006 &lt;ref name="promawards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SIIA / CODIE, 2006, http://www.siia.net/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Version 3 was released in January 2007.
*Version 3.6 was released in December 2007.
*Activprimary 3.6 won the [http://www.worlddidac.org/ Worlddidac] award for Software Innovation for the third time in 2008.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="promawards"/&gt;
*Version 3.7 was released in August 2008.
*[http://www.prometheanworld.com/server.php?show=nav.16874 ActivInspire], the successor to (and the redesign of) Activprimary, was released in March 2009. ActivInspire contains most of the functionality found within ActivPrimary. It also adds support for the ActiveXpression learner response system and the ActivArena Dual User mode. ActivInspire runs on Windows, Mac and Linux platforms.

==Description==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:primarytoolbox.png|thumb| Activprimary toolbox]] --&gt;

Activprimary provides a suite of ‘[[interactive whiteboard]] centric’ tools. The main feature is to allow the user to prepare and present files known as [[flipchart]]s, an electronic document that can contain a combination of vector and raster object data including lines, shapes, rich text, images, video, FLASH media and other third party document types.

The use of the term 'flipchart' in describing these electronic documents derives from the similarity in the way a physical [[flipchart]] is commonly used, effectively starting with a set of 'blank canvas' pages upon which to present.

The flipchart also captures and stores any notes (termed ‘annotations’) which may be written on the surface of the interactive whiteboard using an electronic pen.  Additionally the program allows the user to write (or ‘annotate’) directly over other applications, WEB Browser content and live video clips.

Activprimary includes integrated tools to centrally manage additional interactive inputs including remote annotation and telepointing using wireless handheld Activslates and Activote Student Response Devices.

Activprimary incorporates many of today’s standard ‘whiteboard centric’ concepts, including the spotlight, revealer and zoom functions, a sound recorder, resource library and the interactive protractor, ruler and compass tools. A large selection of editable Restrictors, Properties and Actions can be used to enable the creation of interactive multimedia.

Activprimary has been translated into 32 languages and operates on most versions of the Windows and MAC operating systems.

Whilst Activprimary was originally designed for use on the '''''Activboard Interactive Whiteboard''''', the program can also be used with the standard computer mouse for preparation purposes and is also suitable for running with other types of input device such as a graphics tablet or touchscreen.

==File format==
ActivPrimary uses a proprietary 'flipchart' format ending in the file extension '.flp'.  This utilizes PKZip compression technology to reduce flipchart file sizes.

{{Nihongo|'''Alaxala Networks Corp.'''|アラクサラネットワークス株式会社|Arakusara Nettowākusu Kabushiki-gaisha}}, commonly known as its brand '''Alaxala''', is a Japanese company headquartered in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa]], [[Japan]], that offers [[networking hardware]] products.

==Overview==
Originally, in 2004, Alaxala Networks Corp. was established, as the merger between [[Hitachi]] and [[NEC]] networking hardware divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=27445525|title=Alaxala Networks|publisher=Bloomberg|date=|accessdate=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of '''Alaxala''' was derived from "ALL Access for eXpert and Latent Association", and more that "Ala" in [[Latin]] means "Wing", and "X" means "networking eXchange", so the company intended the two "Ala" (Hitachi and NEC) connected and collaborated by "X" tightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idex.jp/result/naming.php|title=Alaxala Naming|publisher=IDEX (Japanese)|date=|accessdate=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company is basically [[fabless]] company, designing the products, mostly ordering to manufacture them to Hitachi enterprise servers division factory in [[Hadano]], [[Kanagawa]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Hitachi Integrating NEC Resource|publisher=BCN (published magazine, Japanese)|date=2004-12-06|accessdate=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company offers [[networking hardware]] products, [[Router (computing)|network router]] and [[network switch]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itmedia.co.jp/keywords/alaxala.html|title=Alaxala Products|publisher=IT media (Japanese)|date=|accessdate=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alaxala products are sold and installed mostly in [[Japanese domestic market]] and for enterprises, but we can find several products at some [[online shopping]], [[Amazon.com]] etc.. The business type and scope is same as [[Allied Telesis]], that is also the company in Japan. And they are collaborated for producing networking hardware sold in both brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alaxala.com/jp/news/press/2004/20041220-1.html|title=Alaxala Allied Telesis Partnership|publisher=Alaxala (Japanese)|date=|accessdate=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaxala official agencies are Hitachi, NEC, [[Itochu Techno-Solutions]], Net One Systems, and Alaxala has contributed to offer the various networking hardware products to major communication companies in Japan, such as [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]], [[KDDI]] and [[Softbank]] etc..

On August 24, 2012, Alaxala was known that [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] (TSE) announced that TSE core system outage happened due to the software bugs on Alaxala networking hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itpro.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/NEWS/20120824/418104/|title=TSE Announcement for Outage|publisher=IT Pro (Japanese)|date=|accessdate=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaxala also sponsors IT professional certifications for Alaxala products, like [[Cisco]] and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] etc..

==Communities==

===Community===
In 2009, Analog Devices announced EngineerZone, an online technical support community.&lt;ref name=brian&gt;Brian Fuller, Greenley's Ghost. "[http://greeleysghost.brian-fuller.com/2009/06/15/analog-devices-gets-more-digital/ Analog Devices Gets More Digital]." June 15, 2009. Retrieved January 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; EngineerZone was launched so the design engineering community (customers, prospects, partners, employees and students) can ask questions, share knowledge and search for answers to their questions in an open forum.&lt;ref name=brian/&gt;

===Resources===
Analog Devices '''circuits from the lab''' '''reference circuits''' are engineered and tested for quick system integration to help solve design challenges ranging from common to complex. Reference circuits are smaller, modular designs that are more broadly applicable than application-specific reference designs.

Each reference circuit is documented with test data, theory of operation, and component selection decision criteria. In addition, [[reference circuit]]s are tailored to meet real-world system integration needs and may also include board layout schematics, CAD tools models, device drivers, and evaluation hardware.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Buckley, EETimes Europe. "[http://www.analog-europe.com/en/reference-circuit-program-targets-a-growing-challenge-facing-design-engineers-worldwide.html?cmp_id=7&amp;news_id=222901746 Reference circuit program targets a growing challenge facing design engineers worldwide]."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5253">The '''beauty micrometer''', also known as the '''beauty calibrator''', was a device designed in the early 1930s to help in the identification of the areas of a person's face which need to have their appearance reduced or enhanced by [[cosmetics|make-up]].&lt;ref name="MM-MM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NewYorker" /&gt; The inventors include famed beautician [[Max Factor Sr.]]&lt;ref name="MM-PopSci" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherrow" /&gt; A 2013 ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' article described the device as "a ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|Clockwork Orange]]'' style device" that combines "[[phrenology]], cosmetics and a withering pseudo-scientific analysis".&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; A photograph of Factor, using the device on actress [[Marjorie Reynolds]] featured in a 1935 article in science magazine ''[[Mechanix Illustrated|Modern Mechanix]]'' and, when republished by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2013, the caption described it as being "a contraption that looks like an instrument of torture".&lt;ref name="MM-MM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

Placed on and around the head and face, the beauty micrometer uses flexible metal strips which align with a person's facial features. The screws holding the strips in place allow for 325 adjustments, enabling the operator to make fine measurements with a precision of one [[thousandth of an inch]].&lt;ref name="MM-MM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MM-PopSci" /&gt; The inventors stated that there are two key measurements that they looked for: the heights of the nose and forehead should be the same, and the eyes should be separated by the width of one eye. When an imperfection is identified, corrective make-up can be applied to enhance or subdue the feature.&lt;ref name="MM-MM" /&gt; The company [[Max Factor]] claims that the device helped Max Factor, Sr. to better understand the female face.&lt;ref name="MF" /&gt;

The beauty micrometer was completed in 1932 and was primarily intended for use in the movie industry.&lt;ref name="MM-MM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherrow" /&gt; When an actor's face is shown in a very large scale their "flaws" are magnified and can become "glaring distortions", according to the ''Modern Mechanix'' article.&lt;ref name="MM-MM" /&gt; This device was intended to remedy the perceived problem, and the inventors also envisioned it being used in [[Beauty salon|beauty shops]].&lt;ref name="MM-PopSci" /&gt; However, it did not become popular and did not gain widespread usage.&lt;ref name="Lela" /&gt; Only one beauty micrometer is believed to exist. It is featured in a display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum and came up for [[auction]] in 2009, falling significantly short of the $10,000–$20,000 estimate.&lt;ref name="Auc1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auc2" /&gt;

The '''Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia''' (CAADRIA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caadria.org Homepage of CAADRIA (Association for Computer Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia)]&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 1996) provides a platform for [[CAAD]]-related academics and professionals to share experiences, best practices, and results in education and research in Asia and beyond.

== Objectives ==

The association has been created with several objectives. It aims to facilitate dissemination of information about CAAD amongst Asian Schools of Architecture, Planning, Engineering, &amp; Building Sciences in Asia, and encourage the exchange of software, courseware, experiences and staff/students amongst schools. It conducts several activities to identify research and development needs specific to CAAD education and initiate collaboration to satisfy them, and promote research and teaching in CAAD which enhances creativity rather than simply production technologies.

== Organisation ==

=== Membership ===

Membership to the association is open to individuals (teachers, researchers, students, and architects) and institutions (universities, libraries), either as active member (someone who attends the conference) or as sponsor member. Typically, one becomes an individual member through attending and registering at a CAADRIA conference, or by applying for membership to the secretariat. Institutions in Asia, Australia and New Zealand can apply for institutional membership and gain access to CumInCAD database.

Membership lasts for one year, and gives access to digital proceedings of CAADRIA, email announcements of forthcoming events of interest and one vote at the Annual General Meeting of CAADRIA.

=== Executive committee ===

CAADRIA is governed by an administrative council elected by the membership. Responsibility for organisation, administration and guidance of the association is delegated to the executive committee by virtue of the election of the officers. Membership of the council is restricted to members working in countries within the Asia Pacific region; term of office is two years. There is an annual general meeting (normally convened during the annual conference) at which the business of the association is agreed by the membership. This forum is considered the highest level of authority and shall be the only one with the power to amend the charter of CAADRIA.

=== Secretariat ===

The Secretariat is composed of volunteer staff, with a limited budget being made available through membership dues and supervised by the executive committee.

'''Context-aware computing''' refers to a general class of mobile systems that can sense their physical environment, and adapt their behavior accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJSH/vol4_no1_2010/1.pdf|last= Rosslin John |first= Robles|date=January 2010|title= Review: Context Aware Tools for Smart Home Development|journal= International Journal of Smart Home|volume=4|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thyagaraju |last= GS |author2=Umakant P Kulkarni |title=Design and Implementation of User Context aware Recommendation Engine for Mobile using Bayesian Network, Fuzzy Logic and Rule Base|journal=International Journal of Computer Applications|volume=40 |issue=3|pages=47–63 |year= 2012|doi= 10.5120/5028-7176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Context-aware systems are a component of a [[ubiquitous computing]] or [[pervasive computing]] environment.&lt;ref name="Design and Implementation of User Context aware Recommendation Engine for Mobile using Bayesian Network, Fuzzy Logic and Rule Base "&gt;Review:{{cite journal |first=Thyagaraju |last= GS |author2=Umakant P Kulkarni |title=Design and Implementation of User Context aware Recommendation Engine for Mobile using Bayesian Network, Fuzzy Logic and Rule Base|journal=International Journal of Computer Applications|volume=40 |issue=3|pages=47–63 |year= 2012|doi= 10.5120/5028-7176}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Three important aspects of context are: where you are; who you are with; and what resources are nearby. Although location is a primary capability, location-aware does not necessarily capture things of interest that are mobile or changing. Context-aware in contrast is used more generally to include nearby people, devices, lighting, noise level, network availability, and even the social situation, e.g., whether you are with your family or a friend from school.&lt;ref name=" Review: Context Aware Tools for Smart Home Development "&gt;Review: {{cite web|url= http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJSH/vol4_no1_2010/1.pdf|last= Rosslin John |first= Robles|date=January 2010|title= Review: Context Aware Tools for Smart Home Development|journal= International Journal of Smart Home|volume=4|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The concept emerged from [[ubiquitous computing]] research at [[Xerox PARC]] and elsewhere in the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The term 'context-aware' was first used by Schilit and Theimer in their 1994 paper ''Disseminating Active Map Information to Mobile Hosts'' where they describe a model of computing ''in which users interact with many different mobile and stationary computers'' and classify a context-aware systems as one that can ''adapt according to its location of use, the collection of nearby people and objects, as well as the changes to those objects over time over the course of the day.''&lt;ref name="schilit94b"&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Curta''' is a small [[mechanical calculator]] developed by [[Curt Herzstark]]. The Curta's design is a descendant of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s [[Stepped Reckoner]] and [[Charles Xavier Thomas|Charles Thomas's]] [[Arithmometer]], accumulating values on cogs, which are added or complemented by a [[Stepped Reckoner|stepped drum]] mechanism. It has an extremely compact design: a small cylinder that fits in the palm of the hand.

Curtas were considered the best portable calculators available until they were displaced by electronic calculators in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Stoll"/&gt;

== History ==
The Curta was conceived by [[Curt Herzstark]] in the 1930s in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. By 1938, he had filed a key patent, covering his complemented stepped drum, Deutsches Reichspatent (German National Patent) No. 747073. This single drum replaced the multiple drums, typically around 10 or so, of contemporary calculators, and it enabled not only addition, but subtraction through [[nines complement]] math, essentially subtracting by adding. The nines' complement math breakthrough eliminated the significant mechanical complexity created when "borrowing" during subtraction. This drum would prove to be the key to the small, hand-held mechanical calculator the Curta would become.

His work on the pocket calculator stopped in 1938 when the [[Nazi]]s forced him and his company to concentrate on manufacturing precision instruments for the German army.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/curta-death-camp-calculator/45506/?li_source=LI&amp;li_medium=default-widget|title=Curta calculator: The mechanical marvel born in a Nazi death camp|website=newatlas.com|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzstark, the son of a Catholic mother and Jewish father, was taken into custody in 1943 and eventually sent to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], where he was encouraged to continue his earlier research:
{{quote|While I was imprisoned inside Buchenwald I had, after a few days, told the [people] in the work production scheduling department of my ideas. The head of the department, Mr. Munich said, 'See, Herzstark, I understand you've been working on a new thing, a small calculating machine. Do you know, I can give you a tip. We will allow you to make and draw everything. If it is really worth something, then we will give it to the Führer as a present after we win the war. Then, surely, you will be made an Aryan.' For me, that was the first time I thought to myself, my God, if you do this, you can extend your life. And then and there I started to draw the CURTA, the way I had imagined it.&lt;ref name="Quote"&gt;[http://purl.umn.edu/107358 "An Interview with Curt Herzstark"] conducted by Erwin Tomash, Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. [http://purl.umn.edu/107359 Herzstark interview] in German&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

In the camp, Herzstark was able to develop working drawings for a manufacturable device.
Buchenwald was [[Buchenwald concentration camp#Liberation from Nazi Germany|liberated by U.S. troops]] on April 11, 1945, and by November Herzstark had located a factory in Sommertal, near [[Weimar]], whose machinists were skilled enough to produce three working prototypes.&lt;ref name="Quote"/&gt;

[[USSR|Soviet]] forces had arrived in July, and Herzstark feared being sent to Russia, so, later that same month, he fled to Austria. He began to look for financial backers, at the same time filing continuing patents as well as several additional patents to protect his work. The Prince of [[Liechtenstein]] eventually showed interest in the manufacture of the device, and soon a newly formed company, Contina AG Mauren, began production in Liechtenstein.

It was not long before Herzstark's financial backers, thinking they had got from him all they needed, contrived to force him out by reducing to zero the value of all of the company's existing stock, including his one-third interest.&lt;ref name="Stoll"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stoll, Cliff |authorlink=Cliff Stoll |title=The Curious History of the First Pocket Calculator |journal=Scientific American |volume=290 |issue=1 |pages=92–9 |date=January 2004 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-curious-history-of-th |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0104-92 |pmid=14682043}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the same people who had earlier elected not to have Herzstark transfer ownership of his patents to the company, so that, should anyone sue, they would be suing Herzstark, not the company, thereby protecting themselves at Herzstark's expense. This ploy now backfired: without the patent rights, they could manufacture nothing. Herzstark was able to negotiate a new agreement, and money continued to flow to him.

Curtas were considered the best portable calculators available until they were displaced by electronic calculators in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Stoll"/&gt; Herzstark continued to make money from his invention until that time, although, like many inventors before him, he was not among those who profited the most from his invention.{{citation needed|reason=POV|date=July 2015}} The Curta, however, lives on, being a highly popular collectible, with thousands of machines working just as smoothly as they did at the time of their manufacture 40, 50 or 60 years previous.&lt;ref name="Stoll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quote"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kradolfer"&gt;[http://www.vcalc.net/cu-bckup.htm#11 Curt Herzstark and his Pocket Calculator, Peter Kradolfer, backup 6/88 pp. 5–9]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost ==
The Curta Type I was sold for $125 in the later years of production, and the Type II was sold for $175. While only 3% of Curtas were returned to the factory for warranty repair,&lt;ref name="Quote"/&gt; a small, but significant number of buyers returned their Curtas in pieces, having attempted to disassemble them. Reassembling the machine was more difficult, requiring intimate knowledge of the orientation of, and installation order for, each part and sub-assembly, plus special guides designed to hold the pieces in place during assembly. Also, many identical looking parts, each with slightly different dimensions, required test fitting and selection as well as special tools to adjust tolerances.&lt;ref name="tools"&gt;[http://curta.li/05_anleitungen/57_curta_tools_main.html Several specialized Curta tools pictured at curta.li]&lt;/ref&gt;

The machines currently have a high curiosity value and sell for around US$1,000, but going as high as US$1,900 for models in a pristine condition with notable numbers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Design ==
Numbers are entered using slides (one slide per digit) on the side of the device. The ''revolution counter'' and ''result counter'' reside around the shiftable carriage, at the top of the machine. A single turn of the crank adds the input number to the result counter, at any carriage position, and increments the corresponding digit of the revolution counter. Pulling the crank upwards slightly before turning performs a subtraction instead of an addition. Multiplication, division, and other functions require a series of crank and carriage-shifting operations.

The Curta was affectionately known as the "pepper grinder" or "peppermill" due to its shape and means of operation. It was also termed the "math grenade" due to its superficial resemblance to a certain type of [[hand grenade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/ICES%20Insight/INSIGHTWEB2011.pdf#page=13 |title=ICES Insight |publisher=International Council for the Exploration of the Sea |date=September 2011 |volume=48 |isbn= 978-87-7482-097-0|page=13 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Models ===
The Type I Curta has eight digits for data entry (known as "setting sliders"), a six-digit revolution counter, and an eleven-digit result counter. According to the advertising literature, it weighs only {{convert|8|oz}}. Serial number 70154, produced in 1969, weighs {{convert|245|g}}.

The larger Type II Curta, introduced in 1954, has eleven digits for data entry, an eight-digit revolution counter, and a fifteen-digit result counter. It weighs {{convert|13.15|oz}}, based on weighing serial number 550973, produced in early 1966.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

An estimated 140,000 Curta calculators were made (80,000 Type I and 60,000 Type II). According to Curt Herzstark, the last Curta was produced in 1972.&lt;ref name="Quote"/&gt;

== Uses ==
The Curta was popular among contestants in [[rally racing|sports car rallies]] during the 1960s, 1970s and into the 1980s. Even after the introduction of the electronic calculator for other purposes, they were used in time-speed-distance (TSD) rallies to aid in computation of times to checkpoints, distances off-course and so on, since the early electronic calculators did not fare well with the bounces and jolts of rally racing.&lt;ref name="Stoll"/&gt;

Contestants who used such calculators were often called "Curta-crankers" by those who were limited to paper and pencil, or who used computers linked to the car's wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wiltshire/content/articles/2008/02/27/curators_choice_computing_swindon_feature.shtml | title=Pocket calculator fit for a Fuhrer | publisher=BBC | date=2008-02-27 | accessdate=December 3, 2016 | author=Webb, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Curta was also favored by commercial and general-aviation pilots before the advent of electronic calculators because of its precision and the user's ability to confirm the accuracy of his or her manipulations via the revolution counter. Because calculations such as weight and balance are critical for safe flight, precise results free of pilot error are essential.

== Popular culture ==
The Curta plays a role in William Gibson's [[Pattern Recognition (novel)|''Pattern Recognition'']] (2003) as an interesting piece of historic computing machinery as well as a crucial "trade" item.

In 2016 a Curta was designed by Marcus Wu that could be produced on a 3D printer.&lt;ref name="Thingiverse"&gt;[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1943171 The 3D-Printed Curta Calculator on [[Thingiverse]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The fine tolerances needed are beyond present printer technology and this means the Curta has to be much bigger, about the size of a coffee can. [[Mythbuster]] [[Adam Savage]] received one fully printed and assembled at 3x scale from   Wu.&lt;ref name="Savage"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uRckJLqLk The 3D-Printed Curta Calculator - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;  Wu's creation weighs about three pounds.&lt;ref name="Popular_Mechanics"&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a27318/3d-printed-curta-calculator/ This Retro Mechanical Calculator Has Gorgeous 3D-Printed Guts]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deep Space Atomic Clock''' ('''DSAC''') is a miniaturized, ultra-precise mercury-ion [[atomic clock]] for precise [[radio navigation]] in deep space. It is orders of magnitude more stable than existing navigation clocks, and has been refined to limit drift of no more than 1 nanosecond in 10 days.&lt;ref name="DSAC overview"&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/clock/clock_overview.html |title=Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC) |last=Boen |first=Brooke |work=NASA |date=January 16, 2015 |accessdate=2015-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that a DSAC would incur no more than 1 microsecond of error in 10 years of operations.&lt;ref name="DSAC Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/DSAC_Fact_Sheet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Deep Space Atomic Clock |work=NASA |date=2014 |accessdate=2015-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected to improve the precision of deep space navigation, and enable more efficient use of tracking networks. The project is managed by NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and it will be deployed as part of the U.S. Air Force's [[Space Test Program 2]] (STP-2) mission aboard a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon Heavy]] rocket in March 2019.&lt;ref name="pietrobon-military"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sworld.com.au/steven/space/usmil-man.txt|title=United States Military Manifest|last=Pietrobon|first=Steven|date=8 June 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Current ground-based atomic clocks are fundamental to deep space navigation, however, they are too large to be flown in space. This results in tracking data being collected and processed here on Earth (a two-way link) for most deep space navigation applications.&lt;ref name="DSAC Fact Sheet"/&gt;  The Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC) is a miniaturized and stable [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] ion atomic clock that is as stable as a ground clock. &lt;ref name="DSAC Fact Sheet"/&gt; The technology could enable autonomous radio navigation for spacecraft's time-critical events such as orbit insertion or landing, promising new savings on mission operations costs.&lt;ref name="DSAC overview"/&gt; It is expected to improve the precision of deep space navigation, enable more efficient use of tracking networks, and yield a significant reduction in ground support operations.&lt;ref name="DSAC overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizmag"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gizmag.com/deep-space-atomic-clock/37231/ |title=NASA to test atomic clock to keep space missions on time |work=NASA |publisher=Gizmag |date=30 April 2015 |accessdate=2015-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its applications in deep space include:&lt;ref name="DSAC Fact Sheet"/&gt;
*Simultaneously track two spacecraft on a downlink with the [[Deep Space Network]] (DSN).
*Improve tracking data precision by an order of magnitude using the DSN's Ka-band downlink tracking capability.
*Mitigate [[Ka-band]]'s weather sensitivity (as compared to two-way [[X band]]) by being able to switch from a weather-impacted receiving antenna to one in a different location with no tracking outages.
*Track longer by using a ground antenna's entire spacecraft viewing period. At Jupiter, this yields a 10 to 15 percent increase in tracking; at Saturn, it grows to 15 to 25%, with the percentage increasing the farther a spacecraft travels.
*Make new discoveries as a Ka-band—capable radio science instrument with a 10 times improvement in data precision for both [[gravity]] and [[occultation|occultation science]] and deliver more data because of one-way tracking's operational flexibility.
*Explore deep space as a key element of a real-time autonomous navigation system that tracks one-way radio signals on the uplink and, coupled with [[Star tracker|optical navigation]], provides for robust absolute and relative navigation.
*Fundamental to human explorers requiring real-time navigation data.

===Principle and development===
Over 20 years, engineers at NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] have been steadily improving and miniaturizing the mercury-ion trap atomic clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/clock/clock_overview.html#.VGK5sPnF81J |title=Technology Demonstration Missions: Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC) |work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |publisher=NASA |date=16 January 2015 |accessdate=2015-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSAC technology uses the property of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] [[ion]]s' [[Hyperfine structure|hyperfine transition]] frequency at 40.50 [[Hertz|GHz]] to effectively "steer" the frequency output of a [[Crystal oscillator|quartz oscillator]] to a near-constant value. DSAC does this by confining the mercury ions with electric fields in a trap and protecting them by applying magnetic fields and shielding.&lt;ref name="DSAC Fact Sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eoPortal"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/content/-/article/dsac-deep-space-atomic-clock- |title= DSAC (Deep Space Atomic Clock) |work=NASA |publisher=Earth Observation Resources |date=2014 |accessdate=2015-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Approximate dimensions: 29 × 26 × 23 cm&lt;ref name="eoPortal"/&gt; (11 × 10 × 9 inches)
*Mass: 17.5 kg (39 lb)

'''Dialog Semiconductor PLC''' is a [[UK]]-based manufacturer of [[semiconductor]] based system [[solution]]s. The company is headquartered in the [[United Kingdom]] in  [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], with a global sales, R&amp;D and marketing organization.  Dialog creates highly integrated standard (ASSP) and custom (ASIC) mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs), optimised for smartphone, computing, IoT, LED Solid State Lighting (SSL) and smart home applications. Dialog operates a [[fabless]] business model, but maintains its own test and physical laboratories at its office in Kirchheim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dialog-semiconductor.de/lab.php dialog-semiconductor.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it had approximately $1.35 billion in revenue and was one of the fastest growing European public semiconductor companies. It currently has approximately 1,650 employees worldwide. The company is listed on the Frankfurt (FWB: DLG) stock exchange (Regulated Market, Prime Standard, ISIN GB0059822006) and is a member of the German TecDax index.

On 10 February 2011, Dialog announced that it had completed a transaction to acquire SiTel Semiconductor  B.V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4213031/Dialog-buys-wireless--VoIP-chip-firm- Dialog buys wireless, VoIP chip firm]&lt;/ref&gt; ("SiTel"), a short-range wireless, digital cordless and VoIP technology company. In July 2013, Dialog announced that it has completed a transaction to acquire iWatt, an AC/DC power conversion and solid state lighting technologies company.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Dialog Semiconductor is the exclusive designer of [[power management integrated circuit|power management integrated circuits]] (PMICs) for the Apple iPhone, iPad, and Watch, which made up more than 70% of Dialog’s 2016 sales. Its share value halved from April to December 2017 after private bank [[Bankhaus Lampe]] changed its outlook for the company from “hold” to “sell” in the belief Apple would replace Dialog’s PMIC designs with its own, predicting in-house design would be part of a general strategic shift for Dialog’s main client: Apple had established its own PMIC design centres in Munich and California, and in April 2017, Apple graphics chip maker [[Imagination Technologies]] declared that Apple would be designing its graphics chips in-house by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

'''Direct Corporate Access''' (DCA) is part of the [[Faster Payments Service]] which provides a same day clearing payment service to UK member banks. '''Direct Corporate Access''' (DCA) will provide Banks' business customers with direct access to the [[Faster Payments Service]] (FPS) clearing service in a very similar way that Bacstel-IP provides access to [[BACS]].

Direct Corporate Access only enables submission of files of payments, however as the central FPS processes payments individually, [[VocaLink]] the operators of DCA will split the files into individual instructions for processing through [[Faster Payments Service|FPS]].

It was developed by [[APACS]] on behalf of the FPS member banks and the infrastructure went live in March 2009. [[Barclays]] was the first bank live for customer sponsorship in August 2009.

Albany Software was the first solution supplier to successfully process a payment through the Faster Payments Service via DCA, using Albany ePAY on Wednesday 22 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.albany.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/2009/2009-August/eagle-first-commercial-customer-of-dca.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key features==
* DCA is available for file submission 7 days a week 24 hours a day (from September 2011).
* Sterling payments only
* Maximum individual payment value is £250,000 (from 10 November 2015)
* Payments submitted in files via the Secure-IP channel
* Beneficiaries must use FPS addressable sort codes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukpayments.org.uk/sort_code_checker/&lt;/ref&gt;
* DCA users must be sponsored by their bankers (as of 2017, Barclays and HSBC are the only banks offering DCA sponsorship).
* Uses the Bacs Standard 18 formatting, but only allows transaction code 99 (Direct Credit)

==Secure-IP==
Secure-IP is a clone of the existing Bacstel-IP channel used for [[BACS]]. Files of payments are secured using a [[smart card]] or [[hardware security module]] (HSM).

Files of payments submitted by [[IP address|Secure-IP]] will be disaggregated by [[VocaLink]], the operators of DCA, and submitted into the Faster Payments Service. Disaggregation and acceptance may take up to thirty minutes and beneficiaries will receive access to the funds within two hours of acceptance.

The software used to access Secure-IP must be approved. This is an extension to the existing Bacs Approved Software Service (BASS). In March 2009 Albany Software&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albany.co.uk/news/pr_epay_bass.htm Albany November 2008 Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bottomline Technologies]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacs.co.uk/Bacs/SoftwareSuppliers/Resources/Pages/ApprovedSoftware.aspx Bacs Approved Software List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521150412/http://www.bacs.co.uk/Bacs/SoftwareSuppliers/Resources/Pages/ApprovedSoftware.aspx |date=2014-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; received approved status for their first DCA capable products. They were joined in May 2009 by [[Barron McCann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bemac.com/newsfps1 Barron McCann Press Release May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 they were joined by [[Direct Debit Ltd.]] (now part of Bottomline)&lt;ref name="directdebit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directdebit.com/|title=Direct Debit management &amp;#124; Bottomline Technologies|publisher=directdebit.com|accessdate=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Experian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experianpayments.com/industry-information/faster-payments.html Experian]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 they were joined by Fundtech.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundtech.com/Products/Payments/Global-PAYplus-Services-Platform/UK-Faster-Payments&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timescales==
DCA payments are processed by the sponsoring bank according to their Service Level Agreements - for Barclays this is currently a maximum of 30 minutes before the payment is sent to the beneficiary bank. Beneficiary banks which are members of FPS must apply the funds to the beneficiary account within 2 hours, although in most cases it is done immediately. 

==Bureaux==
Bureau organisations can submit files of payments on behalf of other registered service users of Direct Corporate Access.

The bureau needs to be sponsored by a DCA-enabled bank (initially only Barclays) and to use a bureau/DCA version of the approved Bacs Approved Software Service (BASS) software.

The bureau's sponsor bank issues [[public key infrastructure|PKI]] certificates for authorising files in the form of a [[smart card]] or [[hardware security module]] (HSM). The same PKI certificates can be used to authorise [[Bacs]] file submissions via Bacstel-IP.

File submissions can only be made on behalf service of users of a DCA-enabled bank (initially only Barclays).

==Weaknesses==
* Bureau can only submit for their clients who are sponsored by Barclays.

==Alternative products==
* Royal Bank of Scotland (including National Westminster and Coutts Banks)&lt;ref name="coutts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coutts.com/productsandservices/faster-payments/commercial-clients-faqs.asp |title=Coutts Bank FPS FAQ|publisher=coutts.com|accessdate=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and HSBC offer Faster Payments via their electronic banking channels (Bankline and HSBC.Net).

[[File:LNB circuit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[low-noise block converter]] featuring distributed element circuitry.  The circuitry on the right is lumped element.  The distributed element circuitry is centre and left of centre and is constructed in [[microstrip]].]]
'''Distributed element circuits''' are electrical circuits composed of lengths of [[transmission line]]s or other distributed components.  These circuits perform the same functions as conventional circuits composed of [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] components such as [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, and [[transformer]]s.  They are used mostly at [[microwave]] frequencies where conventional components are difficult or impossible to implement.

A major advantage of distributed element circuits is that they can be produced cheaply as a [[printed circuit board]] for consumer products such as [[satellite television]].  They are also made in [[coaxial cable|coaxial]] and [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] formats for applications such as [[radar]], [[satellite communication]], and [[microwave link]]s.

A phenomenon that is much used in distributed element circuits is that a length of transmission line can be made to behave as a [[resonator]].  Distributed element components that do this include [[stub (electronics)|stubs]], [[coupling (physics)|coupled lines]], and cascaded lines.  Circuits built from these components include [[distributed element filter|filters]], [[power dividers and directional couplers|power dividers, directional couplers]], and [[circulator]]s.

Distributed element circuits were investigated in the 1920s and 1930s but did not become important until [[World War II]] when they were used in [[radar]].  After the war their use was at first limited to military, space, and [[broadcasting]] infrastructure use but improvements in [[materials science]] in the field soon led to wider applications.

== Circuit modelling ==
Distributed element circuits are those circuits designed using the [[distributed element model]].  This model is an alternative to the [[lumped element model]] in which the passive [[electrical element]]s of [[electrical resistance]], [[capacitance]] and [[inductance]] are assumed to be "lumped" at one point in space in, respectively, a [[resistor]], [[capacitor]] or [[inductor]] lumped component.  The distributed element model is used when this assumption no longer holds and those quantities are considered to be distributed in space.  The assumption breaks down when there is a significant time taken for [[electromagnetic wave]]s to travel from one terminal of the component to the other.  ''Significant'' in this context is a time in which a noticeable [[Phase (waves)|phase]] change has occurred.  The amount of phase change is very much dependent on the [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]] of the wave.  A common rule of thumb amongst engineers is to change from the lumped to the distributed model when distances involved are more than one-tenth of a wavelength (36° phase change).  In any case, the lumped model completely fails at one-quarter wavelength (90° phase change) with entirely incorrect results.  Due to this dependence on wavelength, the distributed element model is used mostly at the higher frequencies, at low frequencies distributed element components are too bulky.  Distributed designs become feasible above {{nowrap|300 [[MHz]]}} and are the technology of choice at [[microwave]] frequencies above {{nowrap|1 GHz}}.&lt;ref&gt;Vendelin ''et al.'', pp. 35–37&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no clear-cut demarcation in the frequency at which these models should be used.  The changeover is usually somewhere in the range 100 to {{nowrap|500 MHz}} but the scale of the technology being used is significant.  Miniaturised circuits can continue to use the lumped model to a higher frequency.  [[Printed circuit board]]s (pcbs) using [[through-hole technology]] are larger than an equivalent design using [[surface-mount technology]].  [[Hybrid integrated circuit]]s are smaller than pcb technologies and [[monolithic integrated circuit]]s are smaller than both.  Hence, integrated circuits can use lumped designs at higher frequencies than printed circuits and this is done in some [[radio frequency]] integrated circuits.  The choice is particular significant for hand-held devices because lumped element designs generally result in a smaller product.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Nguyen, p. 28|Vendelin ''et al.'', pp. 35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction with transmission lines ===
[[File:Richards transform of Chebyshev filter.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Frequency response of a fifth order [[Chebyshev filter]] constructed from lumped components (top), and distributed components (bottom)]]
The overwhelming majority of distributed element circuits are composed of lengths of [[transmission line]].  This is a particularly simple form to model.  The cross-sectional dimensions of the line are unvarying along its length and are chosen to be small compared to the signal wavelength, thus, distribution along the length of the line only need be considered.  Such an element of a distributed circuit is entirely characterised by its length and [[characteristic impedance]].  A further simplification occurs in [[commensurate line circuit]]s where all the elements are made the same length.  With commensurate circuits, a lumped circuit design [[prototype filter|prototype]] consisting of capacitors and inductors can be directly converted into a distributed circuit with one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the lumped circuit and the distributed circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;

Commensurate line circuits are important because they have an established design theory.  Circuits consisting of arbitrary lengths of transmission line, or even arbitrary shapes, do not.  An arbitrary shape can certainly be ''analysed'' with [[Maxwell's equations]] to determine its behaviour but finding useful structures is a matter of trial and error, or guesswork.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

An important difference between distributed element circuits and lumped element circuits is that the frequency response of a distributed circuit periodically repeats as shown in the [[Chebyshev filter]] example, whereas the equivalent lumped circuit does not.  This is a result of the [[transfer function]] of lumped forms being a [[rational function]] of [[complex frequency]] whereas distributed forms are an irrational function.  Another difference is that [[cascade connection|cascade connected]] lengths of line introduce a fixed delay at all frequencies (assuming an [[Heaviside condition|ideal line]]).  There is no equivalent in lumped circuits for a fixed delay, although an approximation could be constructed over a limited frequency range.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

Distributed element circuits are cheap and easy to manufacture in some formats, but take up more space than lumped element circuits.  This is problematic in mobile devices, especially hand-held ones, where space is at a premium.  If the operating frequencies are not too high, the designer may choose to go down the route of miniaturising components rather than switching to distributed elements.  On the other hand, [[Parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic elements]] and resistive losses in lumped components are greater with increasing frequency as a proportion of the nominal value of the lumped element impedance.  In some cases designers may choose to go to a distributed element design, even if lumped components are available at that frequency, in order to benefit from the improved quality.  Distributed element designs tend to have greater power handling capability.  With a lumped component, all the power being passed by the circuit is concentrated in a small volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Doumanis ''et al.'', pp. 45–46|Nguyen, pp. 27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==

=== Paired conductors ===

There are many forms of transmission line and any of them can be used to construct distributed element circuits.  The historically earliest, and still most widely used, form is a pair of conductors.  The most common form of paired conductors is [[twisted pair]] as used for telephone lines and internet connections.  This is not commonly used for distributed element circuits because the signal frequencies used on these cables are lower than the point where distributed element designs become advantageous.  However, designers frequently start with a lumped element design and then convert it into an open-wire distributed element design.  ''Open wires'' are a pair of parallel uninsulated conductors, for instance as used for [[telephone line]]s on [[telegraph pole]]s.  The designer does not usually intend to implement the circuit in this form, it is merely an intermediate step in the design process.  Distributed element designs with conductor pairs are limited to a few specialist uses such as [[Lecher lines]] and the [[twin-lead]] used for [[antenna (radio)|antenna connections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Gurdeep ''et al.'', pp. 178–179| Magnusson ''et al.'', p. 240|Gupta, p. 5.5|Craig, pp. 291–292|Henderson &amp; Camargo, pp. 24–25|Chen ''et al.'', p. 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coaxial ===
[[File:Koaxrichtkoppler.jpg|thumb|A collection of coaxial [[directional coupler]]s.  One has the cover removed showing the internal coaxial structure.]]
[[Coaxial cable|Coaxial line]], a centre conductor surrounded by a shielding conductor, is widely used for interconnecting units of microwave equipment.  It is also used for longer distance transmissions.  Manufacture of coaxial distributed element devices was common in the second half of the 20th century.  However, these types in many applications have been replaced by planar forms due to cost and size considerations.  Air [[dielectric]] coaxial is used for low-loss and high-power applications.  It is still common for distributed element circuits in other media to transition to a [[coaxial connector]] at the circuit [[Port (circuit theory)|ports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Natarajan, 11–12|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Planar ===
{{main|planar transmission line}}
The majority of modern distributed element circuits use planar transmission lines, especially those in mass-produced consumer items.  There are several forms of planar line, but the kind known as [[microstrip]] is the most common.  It can be manufactured by the same process as [[printed circuit board]]s and hence is cheap to make.  It also lends itself to integration with lumped circuits on the same board.  Other forms of printed planar lines include [[stripline]] and [[finline]] and many variations.  Planar lines can also be used in [[monolithic microwave integrated circuit]]s where they are integral to the device chip.&lt;ref&gt;Ghione &amp; Pirola, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waveguide ===
{{main|waveguide (electromagnetism)}}
[[File:Waveguide-post-filter.JPG|thumb| A [[waveguide filter]]]]
Many of the distributed element designs can be directly implemented in waveguide.  However, there is an additional complication with waveguides in that multiple [[waveguide mode|modes]] are possible.  These sometimes exist simultaneously and this situation has no analogy in conducting lines.  Waveguides have the advantages of lower loss and higher [[Q factor|quality]] resonators over conducting lines, but their relative expense and bulk means that microstrip is often preferred.  Waveguide mostly finds uses in high-end products such as high-power military radars and the upper microwave bands where planar formats are too lossy.  Waveguide becomes bulkier with lower frequency which militates against its use in the lower bands.&lt;ref&gt;Ghione &amp; Pirola, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanical ===

In a few specialist applications such as the [[mechanical filter]]s in high-end radio transmitters (marine, military, amateur radio) electronic circuits can be implemented as mechanical components.  This is done largely because of the high quality of the mechanical resonators.  They are used in the [[radio frequency]] band below microwave frequencies where waveguides might otherwise be used.  Mechanical circuits too can be implemented, in whole or in part, as distributed element circuits.  The frequency at which the transitions to distributed element design becomes feasible or necessary are much lower with mechanical circuits.  This is because the speed signals travel through mechanical media is much lower than the speed of electrical signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Taylor &amp; Huang pp. 353–358|Johnson (1983), p. 102|Mason (1961)|Johnson ''et al.'' (1971), pp. 155, 169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circuit components ==

There are several structures that are repeatedly used in distributed element circuits.  Some of the common ones are described below.

=== Stub ===
{{main|Stub (electronics)}}

A stub is a short length of line that branches to the side of a main line.  The end of the stub is often left open- or short-circuited but may also be terminated with a lumped component.  A stub can be used on its own, for instance for [[impedance matching]], or several of them can be used together in a more complex circuit such as a filter.  A stub can be designed as the equivalent of a lumped capacitor, inductor, or [[resonator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Edwards &amp; Steer, pp. 78, 345–347|Banerjee, p. 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Microstrip Low Pass Bowtie Stub Filter.jpg|thumb|Butterfly stub filter]]
Departures from constructing with uniform transmission lines in distributed element circuits are rare.  One such departure that is widely used is the radial stub which is shaped like a [[circular sector|sector of a circle]].  They are often used in pairs, one either side of the main transmission line.  Such pairs are called butterfly or bowtie stubs.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards &amp; Steer, pp. 347–348&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coupled lines ===
Coupled lines are two transmission lines between which there is some electromagnetic [[coupling (physics)|coupling]].  The coupling can be direct or indirect.  In indirect coupling the two lines are run closely together for a distance with no screening between them.  The strength of the coupling depends on the distance between the lines and the cross section presented to the other line.  In direct coupling, branch lines directly connect the two main lines together at intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Magnusson ''et al.'', p. 199|Garg ''et al.'', p. 433|Chang &amp; Hsieh, pp. 227–229|Bhat &amp; Koul, pp. 602–609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coupled lines are a common method of constructing [[power dividers and directional couplers]].  Another property of coupled lines is that they act as a pair of coupled resonators.  This property is used in many distributed element filters.&lt;ref&gt;Bhat &amp; Koul, pp. 10, 602, 622&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cascaded lines ===
[[File:Orthomode transducer.jpg|thumb|An [[orthomode transducer]] (a variety of [[duplexer]]) featuring stepped impedance matching]]
Cascaded lines are lengths of transmission line where the output of one line is connected to the input of the next.  Multiple cascaded lines of different characteristic impedances can be used to construct a filter or a wide-band impedance matching network.  This is called a stepped impedance structure.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 787&lt;/ref&gt;  A single cascaded line one quarter of a wavelength long forms a [[quarter-wave impedance transformer]].  This has the useful property of transforming any impedance network into its [[dual impedance|dual]].  In this role it is called an impedance inverter.  This structure can be used in filters to implement a lumped element prototype in [[ladder topology]] as a distributed element circuit.  The quarter-wave transformers are alternated with some kind of distributed element resonator to achieve this.  However, this is now a dated design and more compact inverters such as the impedance step are used instead.  An impedance step is the discontinuity formed at the junction of two cascaded transmission lines of different characteristic impedance.&lt;ref&gt;Helszajn, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Helical resonator ===
{{main|Helical resonator}}
Helical resonators consist of a helix of wire in a cavity.  One end is unconnected and the other is bonded to the cavity wall.  Although superficially similar to a lumped inductor, helical resonators are, in fact, a distributed element component and are used in the [[VHF]] and lower [[UHF]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Whitaker, p. 227|Doumanis ''et al.'', pp. 12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circuit blocks ==
=== Filters and impedance matching ===
{{main|Distributed element filter}}
[[File:Microstrip Hairpin Filter And Low Pass Stub Filter.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A microstrip [[band-pass]] hairpin filter (left) followed by a [[low-pass]] stub filter (right)]]
Filters form a major part of the circuits constructed with distributed elements.  There is a very wide range of structures used for constructing filters.  These include stubs, coupled lines and cascaded lines.  Variations of these themes include interdigital filters, combline filters and hairpin filters.  Many filters are constructed in conjunction with [[dielectric resonator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref| Hong &amp; Lancaster, pp. 109, 235|Makimoto &amp; Yamashita, p. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent developments include [[fractal]] filters.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

As with lumped element filters, the more elements that are used, the closer the filter comes to an [[brickwall filter|ideal response]] and the structure can become quite complex.&lt;ref&gt;Harrell, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, for simple narrowband requirements just a single resonator may suffice such as a single stub or a [[spurline filter]].&lt;ref&gt;Awang, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

Impedance matching for narrow-band applications is frequently achieved with a single matching stub.  However, for wide-band applications the impedance matching network takes on a definite filter-like design.  The designer starts by prescribing the required frequency response and designs a filter with that response.  The only difference from a standard filter design is that the source and load impedances of the filter differ.&lt;ref&gt;Bahl, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power dividers, combiners and directional couplers ===
{{main|Power dividers and directional couplers}}
[[File:Microstrip Sawtooth Directional Coupler.jpg|thumb|upright|A microstrip sawtooth directional coupler (a variation of the coupled lines directional coupler)&lt;ref&gt;Maloratsky, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A directional coupler is a four-port device that couples power flowing in one direction only from one path to another.  Two of the ports are the input port and output port of the main line.  A proportion of the power entering the input port is coupled to a third port, called the ''coupled port''.  None of the power entering the input port is coupled to the fourth port, usually called the ''isolated port''.  For power flowing in the reverse direction and entering the output port, a reciprocal situation occurs.  Some of the power is coupled to the isolated port, but none is coupled to the coupled port.&lt;ref&gt;Sisodia &amp; Raghuvansh, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Power dividers are often constructed as a directional coupler with the isolated port permanently terminated in a matched load making them effectively a three-port device.  There is no essential difference between the two devices.  The term ''directional coupler'' tends to be used when the coupling factor (the proportion of power reaching the coupled port) is low and ''power divider'' when the coupling factor is high.  A power combiner is simply a power splitter used in reverse.  In distributed element implementations using coupled lines, indirectly coupled lines are more suitable for low-coupling directional couplers and directly coupled branch line couplers are more suitable for high-coupling power dividers.&lt;ref&gt;Ishii, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

Distributed element designs rely on the length of the elements being one-quarter wavelength (or some other length).  This will only be true at one particular frequency.  Simple designs thus have a limited [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] over which they will work successfully.  As with impedance matching networks, a wide-band design requires multiple sections and the design starts to take on a filter-like form.&lt;ref&gt;Bhat &amp; Khoul, pp. 622–627&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hybrids ====
[[File:Ratracecoupler-arithmetics.svg|thumb|upright|Hybrid ring being used to produce sum and difference signals]]
A directional coupler that splits power equally between the output and coupled ports (a {{nowrap|3 [[decibel|dB]]}} coupler) is called a ''hybrid''.&lt;ref&gt;Maloratsky, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''hybrid'' originally referred to a [[hybrid transformer]], a lumped device used in telephones, but now has a wider meaning.  A widely used distributed element hybrid that does not fall into the category of coupled lines is the ''hybrid ring'' or [[rat-race coupler]].  Each of the four ports is connected to a ring of transmission line at different points.  It works by waves travelling in opposite directions around the ring setting up [[standing wave]]s.  At some points on the ring, destructive [[wave interference|interference]] results in a null and no power will leave a port set at that point.  At other points, constructive interference maximises the power transferred.&lt;ref&gt;Chang &amp; Hsieh, pp. 197–198&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of using a hybrid coupler is to produce the sum and difference of two signals.  The diagram shows a hybrid ring being used in this way.  The two input signals are fed into the ports marked as 1 and 2.  The sum of the two signals appears at the port marked as Σ and the difference at the port marked as Δ.&lt;ref&gt;Ghione &amp; Pirola, pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides their use as couplers and power dividers, directional couplers can be used in [[balanced mixer]]s, [[frequency discriminator]]s, [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]]s, [[phase shifter]]s, and [[antenna array]] [[antenna feed|feed]] networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Chang &amp; Hsieh, p. 227|Maloratsky, p. 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Circulator ===
[[File:Ferritzirkulator1.jpg|thumb|upright|A coaxial ferrite circulator operating at {{nowrap|1 GHz}}]]
{{main|circulator}}
A circulator is usually a 3-port or 4-port device in which power entering one port is transferred to the next port in rotation as if round a circle.  Power can only flow in one direction around the circle (clockwise or anticlockwise) and no power is transferred to any of the other ports.  Most distributed element circulators are based on [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Sharma, pp. 175–176|Linkhart, p. 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uses of circulators include using as an [[Isolator (microwave)|isolator]] to protect a transmitter or other equipment from damage due to reflections from the antenna, and a [[duplexer]] connecting antenna, transmitter and receiver of a radio system.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Meikle, p. 91|Lacomme ''et al.'', pp. 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unusual application of a circulator is in a reflection amplifier where the [[negative resistance]] of a [[Gunn diode]] is used to reflect back more power than it received.  The circulator is used to direct the input and output power flows to separate ports.&lt;ref&gt;Roer, pp. 255–256&lt;/ref&gt;

Passive circuits, both lumped and distributed, are nearly always [[Reciprocity (network theory)|reciprocal]].  Circulators are an exception to this.  There are several ways to define or represent reciprocity.  A convenient one for circuits at microwave frequencies (where distributed element circuits are used) is in terms of their [[S-parameters]].  A reciprocal circuit will have an S-parameter matrix, [''S''], that is [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]].  From the definition of a circulator it is clear that this will not be the case;

:&lt;math&gt;[S] = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

for an ideal 3-port circulator.  Thus circulators must be non-reciprocal by definition.  This also means that it is impossible to build a circulator from standard passive components, either lumped or distributed.  The presence of the ferrite, or some other non-reciprocal material or system, is essential for the device to work.&lt;ref&gt;Maloratsky, pp. 285–286&lt;/ref&gt;

== Active components ==
[[File:Transistors in microstrip.jpg|thumb|Microstrip circuit featuring discrete transistors in miniature [[surface-mount technology|surface mount]] packages, capacitors and resistors in chip form, and [[biasing]] filters as distributed elements]]
Distributed elements are passive elements, but most applications will require active components in some role.  A microwave [[hybrid integrated circuit]] uses distributed elements for many passive components, but active components such as [[diode]]s and [[transistor]]s, and some passive components, are discrete.  The active components may be packaged, or they may be placed on the substrate in chip form without any individual packaging to reduce their size and eliminate the packaging parasitics.&lt;ref&gt;Bhat &amp; Khoul, pp. 9–10, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Distributed amplifier]]s consist of a number of amplifying devices, usually [[FET]]s, with all their inputs connected via one transmission line, and all their outputs via another transmission line.  The lengths of the two lines must be equal between each transistor for the circuit to work correctly.  Each transistor adds to the output of the amplifier.  This is different from a conventional [[multistage amplifier]] where the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] is ''multiplied'' by the gain of each stage.  A distributed amplifier thus has lower gain than a conventional amplifier with the same number of transistors.  However, it has significantly greater bandwidth.  In a conventional amplifier, the bandwidth is reduced by each additional stage.  In a distributed amplifier the overall bandwidth is the same as the bandwidth of a single stage.  Distributed amplifiers are used when a single large transistor, or a complex multi-transistor amplifier would be too large to treat as a lumped component.  The linking transmission lines serve to separate the individual transistors.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar &amp; Grebennikov, 153–154&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Distributed element filter#History|Waveguide filter#History|Planar transmission line#History}}
[[File:Heaviside face.jpg|thumb|upright|Oliver Heaviside]]
Distributed element modelling was first used in electrical network analysis by [[Oliver Heaviside]]&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1881.  Heaviside used this to find a correct description of the behaviour of signals on the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].  Transmission of early transatlantic telegraph had been difficult and slow due to an effect now called [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] but this was not well understood at the time.  Heaviside's analysis, now referred to as the [[telegrapher's equations]], identified the problem and suggested&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside (1887)&lt;/ref&gt; [[loading coil|methods for overcoming it]].  This is still the standard analysis of transmission lines.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Warren P. Mason]] was the first to investigate the possibility of distributed element circuits.  He filed a patent&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1927 for a coaxial filter designed by this method.  Mason and Sykes published the definitive paper on the method in 1937.  Mason was also the first to suggest a distributed element acoustic filter in his 1927 doctoral thesis, and a distributed element mechanical filter in a patent&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; filed in 1941.  In fact, the acoustic work had come first and as a result of it Mason's colleagues at [[Bell Labs]] in the Radio Department requested him to assist with coaxial and waveguide filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Johnson ''et al.'' (1971), p. 155|Fagen &amp; Millman, p. 108|Polkinghorn (1973)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mason's work was concerned with the coaxial form and other conducting wires, although much of it could also be adapted for waveguide.  Prior to [[World War II]] there was not much call for distributed element circuits.  The frequencies chosen for radio transmissions at the time were always lower than the point at which distributed elements became advantageous.  This was due to lower frequencies having a greater range, a primary consideration for [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] purposes.  This all changed with the wartime requirements for radar.  There was a surge in distributed element filter development (an essential component of radars) and the technology was extended from the coaxial domain into the waveguide domain.&lt;ref&gt;Levy &amp; Cohn, p. 1055&lt;/ref&gt;

The wartime work was mostly not published until after the war for secrecy reasons.  This made it difficult to disentangle who exactly was responsible for each development.  An important centre for this research was the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]] (Rad Lab), but work was also undertaken elsewhere in the US and Britain.  The Rad Lab work was published&lt;ref&gt;Fano &amp; Lawson (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; by Fano and Lawson.&lt;ref&gt;Levy &amp; Cohn, p. 1055&lt;/ref&gt;  Another wartime development was the hybrid ring.  This work was carried out at [[Bell Labs]] and was published&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; after the war by W. A. Tyrrell.  Tyrrell describes hybrid rings implemented in waveguide and analyses them in terms of the well known waveguide [[magic tee]].  However, other researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Sheingold &amp; Morita (1953)|Albanese &amp; Peyser (1958)}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon published coaxial versions of this device.&lt;ref&gt;Ahn, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

George Matthaei led a research group at [[Stanford Research Institute]] that included [[Leo C. Young|Leo Young]].  The group was responsible for many filter designs.  Matthaei himself first described the interdigital filter&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; and the combline filter.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;  The group's work was published&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; in a landmark book in 1964 covering the state of distributed element circuit design at that time.  It remained a major reference work for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Levy and Cohn, pp. 1057–1059.&lt;/ref&gt;

Planar formats started to take off with the invention of stripline by [[Robert M. Barrett]].  Stripline was another wartime invention, but the details were not published&lt;ref&gt;Barrett &amp; Barnes (1951)&lt;/ref&gt; until 1951.  Microstrip, invented in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;Grieg and Englemann (1952)&lt;/ref&gt; became a commercial rival to stripline.  However, planar formats did not start to become widely used in microwave applications until better dielectric materials became available for the substrates in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Another structure that had to wait for better materials was the dielectric resonator.  Its advantages of compact size and high quality were first pointed out&lt;ref&gt;Richtmeyer (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; by R. D. Richtmeyer in 1939.  However, materials with good temperature stability were not found until the 1970s.  Dielectric resonator filters are now common in both waveguide and transmission line filters.&lt;ref&gt;Makimoto &amp; Yamashita, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

On the theoretical front, an important development was the [[commensurate line theory]] of [[Paul I. Richards]] published&lt;ref&gt;Richards (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948.  [[Kuroda's identities]], an important set of transforms that allowed many designs to be practically implemented, were provided&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|First English publication:|Ozaki &amp; Ishii (1958)}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Kuroda in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Levy &amp; Cohn, pp. 1056–1057&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems}}

An '''eMortgage''' is an electronic [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] where the loan documentation is created, executed, transferred and stored electronically.  

In the [[United States]] eMortgages are made legally [[enforceable]] by the [[Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act]] and the [[Uniform Electronic Transactions Act]]. [[Standardization]] of eMortgages is being facilitated in the United States by the [[Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization]] (MISMO) eMortgage workgroup, which builds on the existing MISMO data standards, adding data elements and [[electronic signature]] capabilities to create an infrastructure for fully electronic mortgages. The eMortgage infrastructure is built around the concept of a [[SMART Document]] and the SMART DOC implementation guide.

==History==
On June 30, 2000, the U.S. Congress passed the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, which together with the state laws like the [[Uniform Electronic Transactions Act]] enable the origination of enforceable electronic mortgages. 

On June 28, 2002, [[Fannie Mae]] announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.efanniemae.com/sf/technology/commitloandel/emtg/index.jsp |title=eMortgage Delivery |publisher=Fannie Mae |accessdate=2007-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; its readiness to purchase eMortgages in the role of investor in the [[secondary mortgage market]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1001">'''Elegant degradation''' is a term used in engineering to describe what occurs to machines which are subject to constant, repetitive stress.

Externally, such a machine maintains the same appearance to the user, appearing to function properly. Internally, the machine slowly weakens over time. Eventually, unable to withstand the stress, it breaks down. Compared to [[Fault-tolerant system|graceful degradation]], the operational quality does not decrease at all, but the breakdown may be just as sudden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assetinsights.net/Glossary/G_Elegant_Degradation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This term's meaning varies depending on context and field, and may not be strictly considered exclusive to engineering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">'''Elmore delay'''&lt;ref name="Elmore"/&gt; is a simple approximation to the delay through an [[RC network]] in an electronic system.  It is often used in applications such as [[logic synthesis]], [[delay calculation]], [[static timing analysis]], [[Placement (EDA)|placement]] and [[Routing (EDA)|routing]], since it is simple to compute (especially in [[Tree network|tree structured networks]],  which are the vast majority of signal nets within ICs) and is reasonably accurate.  Even where it is not accurate, it is usually faithful, in the sense that reducing the Elmore delay will almost always reduce the true delay, so it is still useful in optimization.

Elmore delay can be thought of in several ways, all mathematically identical.
*For tree structured networks, find the delay through each segment as the R ([[electrical resistance]]) times the downstream C (electrical [[capacitance]]).  Sum the delays from the [[Root_node#Root_nodes|root]] to the [[Traffic flow (computer networking)|sink]].
*Assume the output is a simple exponential, and find the exponential that has the same integral as the true response.  This is also equivalent to ''moment matching'' with one moment, since the first moment is a pure exponential.
*Find a one pole approximation to the true frequency response.  This is a first-order [[Padé approximant|Padé approximation]].

There are many extensions to Elmore delay.  It can be extended to upper and lower bounds,&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt; to include [[inductance]] as well as R and C, to be more accurate (higher order approximations)&lt;ref name="Tutuianu"/&gt; and so on.  See [[delay calculation]] for more details and references.

An '''exit sign''' is a device in a public facility (such as a building, aircraft, or boat) denoting the location of the closest [[emergency exit]] in case of fire or other emergency. Most relevant [[code (law)|codes]] ([[fire code|fire]], [[building code|building]], health, or safety) require exit signs to be permanently lit.

Exit signs are designed to be absolutely unmistakable and understandable to anyone. In the past, this generally meant exit signs that show the word "EXIT"&lt;ref&gt;The English word "exit" comes directly from the Latin word meaning "(he or she) goes out.&lt;/ref&gt; or the equivalent in the local language, but increasingly exit signs around the world are in [[pictogram]] form, with or without supplementary text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2246107/|title=The Big Red Word vs. the Little Green Man: The international war over exit signs.|first=Julia|last=Turner|publisher=Slate|date=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

Early exit signs were generally either made of metal and lit by a nearby [[incandescent light bulb]]&lt;ref name=WH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exitsignwarehouse.com/exit-signs-history.html|title=Exit Signs|work=exitsignwarehouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or were a white glass cover with "EXIT" written in red, placed directly in front of a single-bulb [[light fixture]].  An inherent flaw with these designs was that in a fire, the power to the light often failed.  In addition, the fixtures could be difficult to see in a fire where smoke often reduced visibility, despite being relatively bright. The biggest problem was that the exit sign was hardly distinguishable from an ordinary safety lighting fixture commonly installed above doors in the past. The problem was partially solved by using red-tinted globes instead.

Better signs were soon developed that more resembled today's modern exit sign, with an incandescent bulb inside a rectangular-shaped box that backlit the word "EXIT" on one or both sides.  Being larger than its predecessors, this version of the exit sign solved some of the visibility problems.  The sign was only useful as long as mains power remained on.

As [[rechargeable battery|battery-backup]] systems became smaller and more efficient, some exit signs began to use a dual-power system.  Under normal conditions, the exit sign was lit by mains power and the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] was in a charged state. In the event of a power outage, the battery would supply power to light the sign.  It continued to discharge until mains power returned to the unit, or the battery was no longer able to provide sufficient power to light the sign.  Early battery-backup systems were big, heavy, and costly.&lt;ref name=WH /&gt; Modern systems are lightweight, can be installed virtually anywhere, and are integrated into the fixture, rather than requiring a separate box.  As batteries improved, so did the amount of time that a fixture could remain lit on batteries.

While exit signs were more visible due to large letters, even a 60-watt incandescent bulb shining through a plastic or glass cover could appear somewhat dim under certain conditions.  Incandescent bulbs are still in use because they are cheap and common, even though they use more electricity and require more or less frequent replacement. Incandescent bulbs lit 24/7 have a greatly extended lifespan compared to ones that cycle on and off. When used in exit signs, they are often operated at a lower voltage than rated, which further extends their lifetime, at the tradeoff of reduced light output and greatly reduced energy efficiency.

With the development of [[fluorescent lamp]] and [[light-emitting diode]] technology, exit signs could be made even brighter to compensate for the limited visibility in a fire situation, while using less electricity.  Fluorescent lamps work in the same way as incandescent bulbs, back-lighting both sides of an exit fixture from within. LED signs combine a large number of bright light-emitting diodes to illuminate the sign from inside.  An exit sign is constantly lit; fluorescent bulbs need to be changed more often than LEDs, although the absence of frequent on/off cycles extends the life of fluorescent lamps significantly.  Generally, LEDs have a very long life, and may last for 10 years or more of continuous use, although their brightness may gradually diminish. 

Radioluminescent and phosphorescent signs that require no electricity have also been developed, and have been used since the 1970s. [[Radioluminescence]] uses the radioactive decay of [[tritium]] gas to illuminate the sign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/fs-tritium.html|title=NRC: Backgrounder on Tritium EXIT Signs|work=nrc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[phosphorescence]] uses light-emitting [[phosphors]] to [[Phosphorescence|glow in the dark]]. While both of these signs meet California State [[Fire Marshal]] standards, electricity is used in the vast majority of signs.

Most exit signs in the world, except in countries such as the US, Australia, Hong Kong, Philippines, and Singapore, are of pictogram type. Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong have made changes to their respective life safety codes to encourage pictogram use. 

In the US, regulations require text based exit signs for all standard mounted applications. However, globalization has led to limited adoption of the ISO pictogram in the US. For example, the NFPA has approved the ISO pictogram  as an option for low level glow-in-the-dark signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=NFPA 170 Standard for Fire Safety and Emergency Symbols|last=|first=|publisher=National Fire Protection Association|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=170-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York City local law 26 requires these low level symbolic signs in all high rise buildings. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asse.org/new-york-city-building-code-reference-standard-rs-6-1-photoluminescent-low-level-exit-path-markings/|title=New York City Building Code Reference Standard RS 6-1 Photoluminescent Low-Level Exit Path Markings - Other News - News {{!}} American Society of Safety Engineers|website=www.asse.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tunnels, the [[Transportation Research Board]] recommends using the ISO symbol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdta.maryland.gov/news/mdta_news_releases/new-fire-exit-signs-are-proactive-safety-measure-in-harbor-tunnel]&lt;/ref&gt; Newer [[Airbus]], [[Bombardier CS100]] and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]] planes started using the new pictogram exit signs, which were approved by the FAA in 2012 and 2014 (depending on aircraft type).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/data_research/research/med_humanfacs/oamtechreports/2010s/media/201403.pdf|title=Identification and Comprehension of Symbolic Exit Signs for Small Transport-Category Airplanes|last=|first=|date=February 2012|website=FAA.gov|publisher=US Federal Aviation Administration|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Mar 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern exit signs often can be seen indicating the path to an exit in commercial and large residential buildings that comply with [[fire code]]. Certain circumstances, such as the year a building was built, may leave it exempt from some of these codes. In most situations, the owner of the building is responsible for complying with exit sign requirements.  This is especially true in older buildings that serve as multiple residences, such as apartment buildings, hotels, and campus [[dormitory|dormitories]]. Modern signs can also adopt active and/or dissuasive signage solutions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dissuasive exit signage for building fire evacuation |last=Olander J. |author2=Ronchi E. |author3=Lovreglio R. |author4=Nilsson D. |journal=Applied Ergonomics |year=2017 |volume=59 |pages=84-93 |doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2016.08.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Modern fixtures are usually in a rugged plastic or metal housing securely bolted to the wall or ceiling.  The signs have the word "EXIT", or a picture representing exit, on both sides.  Single-sided signs are also available for wall-mount installations.  The signs often have metal or plastic [[knock-outs]] which can be removed so that an arrow is also lit pointing left or right. Modern exit signs are often combined with other safety devices, such as emergency floodlighting for supplementary area illumination &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wbstech.com.au/product/led-blade-exit-light-with-spotfire/|title=LED Blade Exit Light With Spotfire|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Exit signs draw a relatively small amount of power, and can generally be added onto any existing electrical circuit without adverse effects.  Modern exit signs are also, to some degree, [[flame retardant]].

In addition, specialized LED lamps with "candelabra" sized screw-in bases are available to replace the always-on incandescent lamps in older exit signs.  This allows the existing fixtures to be easily upgraded to save energy, without the expense of complete replacement.

Most recently, LEC ([[light emitting capacitor]]) exit signs have come to market. Also called [[electroluminescent]] (EL), these signs only consume 1/4W of power, and have an operational life of 30+ years which far exceeds the typical 10-year life of an LED sign.

=== Non-compliance with building codes ===
It is a serious offense as a building owner or landlord to not comply with the fire/building code in terms of Exit signage. In July 2016, for example, a fire in a Toronto apartment caused the death of one person and injured many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/7-in-hospital-1-without-vital-signs-after-highrise-fire-1.3040030|title=CBC Canada|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;An investigation found that Emergency and Exit lights were not properly illuminated, and the landlord was fined about $20,000 for "not properly illuminating exit signs, and having no record of emergency lighting tests", and another $50,000 for other infractions to the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/07/18/landlord-fined-71000-after-fatal-jane-st-apartment-fire.html|title=Toronto Star|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lighting==
[[File:Tritium-exit-sign.jpg|thumb|Sign illuminated by radioactive [[tritium]]]]
[[File:Exit sign - inside.jpg|thumb|Inside of an emergency light/exit sign combination unit with light bulbs and backup battery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency Lighting / EXIT Signage Testing Requirements|url=http://www.townofbrighton.org/index.aspx?NID=756|website=Brighton Town Hall|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Since visibility may be reduced in a fire, due to [[smoke]] or failure of electric lighting, the sign is often permanently illuminated, usually by one of:

* [[Radioluminescence]] (or "self-luminous") where a [[phosphor]] coating inside a [[glass]] tube glows due to the [[beta decay]] of [[radioactive]] [[tritium]] gas sealed into the tube. Radioluminescent exit signs are prohibited in US [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/DOD/UFC/ufc_3_600_01.pdf Unified Facility Criteria (UFC) 3-600-01]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Photoluminescence]] (or "glow in the dark") use [[phosphorescence]], where light absorbed earlier from the surroundings is slowly re-emitted
* Electric lighting, with a local [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable power source]]
* Electric lighting, with the building's emergency lighting circuits providing [[Emergency power system|back-up power]] from a [[Uninterruptible power supply|UPS]] or a [[Motor-generator|generator]] in case normal power fails

==Color and design==
[[File:Exit light sign.JPG|thumb|Emergency exit light sign in the UK]]
In most regions, including the [[European Union]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and [[China]], exit signs have [[green]] lettering. (In this color scheme, red is reserved to indicate prohibited activities.) In most European countries, pictograms are used in place of the word "exit". European sign directive 92/58/EEC of 24 June 1992 indicates that the signs should be green in color to indicate a safe place of exit. BS EN 1838:1999, BS 5266-7:1999 also governs the emergency lighting applications.

In the US, exit signs can have either red or green lettering, but traditionally have been red.  Many states or cities have enacted building codes which specify the sign color. For example, in [[Baltimore]], [[Salt Lake City]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], green is required. New York City, [[Rhode Island]], and [[Chicago]] (along with the rest of [[Illinois]]) require that exit signs have red text.

New and renovated buildings in Canada are required to use the international standard green "running man" pictogram. The 1995 Canadian [[National Building Code of Canada|national building code]] required "red letters on a contrasting background or white letters on a red background ... spelling EXIT or SORTIE",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/publications/equipment/lighting/section11.cfm?attr=4|title=Lighting Reference Guide – Exit Signs|website=National Resources Canada|archive-url=http://archive.is/Tf60|archive-date=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the 2010 Code calls for a switch from the red EXIT signs to the green "running-man" signs.&lt;ref name="Carss"&gt;{{cite web

|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national building code informs provincial and municipal building codes but does not have legal status itself. Most Canadian jurisdictions require the international green "running-man" pictogram, however some have allowed red "EXIT" signs to be maintained in older properties so long as one style is used consistently throughout the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Green fluorescent signs can be seen better in dark conditions than other colors, as the human [[rod cell]] is more sensitive to these wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stryer|first=L|title=Biochemistry|year=2002|publisher=W H Freeman|location=New York|pages=32.3.1|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22541/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowmaker|first=J K|author2=Dartnell|title=Visual pigments of rods and cones in a human retina|journal=Journal of Physiology|year=1980|volume=298|pages=501–511|pmc=1279132|pmid=7359434|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1980.sp013097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newly installed exit signs in [[Australia]] are green with white "running man" figure (AS2293).

==Accessible designs==
There is a trend towards providing a more [[Accessibility|accessible]], socially inclusive exit sign design based on [[universal design]] principles, including consideration for people with [[disability]] in an overall exit sign strategy for a building or facility.

The Accessible Exit Sign Project started in Australia in 2014, has spread to New Zealand and the United States, and is an international awareness campaign that promotes the need for an accessible means of egress. Advocates proposes that appropriate exit signage to identify the accessible means of egress is a critical component to the successful emergency planning for any building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why are accessible exit signs important?|url=http://accessibleexitsigns.com/why-are-accessible-exit-signs-important/|website=Accessible Exit Sign Project|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed new exit sign design features an "Accessible Means of Egress Icon", which includes an adaptation of the "running man" symbol with a new wheelchair symbol. The design is considered an enhanced version of the [[ISO 7010]] and [[ISO 21542]] accessible exit sign that shows the "running man" and [[International Symbol of Access]] at the end of the sign. The universally inclusive design with the "running man" and 'Accessible Means of Egress Icon' wheelchair symbol essentially share the same upper torso, and the design shows the two moving through the door together. [[Global Alliance on Accessible Technologies and Environments|The Global Alliance on Accessible Technologies and Environments (GAATES)]] has stated that the introduction of the "Accessible Means of Egress Icon" onto exit signage changes the current discriminatory approach to emergency exit signs and presents a fully inclusive design.&lt;ref name="GAATES"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Accessible Exit Sign Project|url=http://globalaccessibilitynews.com/2014/12/09/the-accessible-exit-sign-project/ |publisher=GAATES Global Accessibility News|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The combined ‘Running Man’ and ‘Accessible Means of Egress Icon’ shown above are working together to escape the building. They move in unison, display the same urgency and motion and appear to be travelling at the same speed. Their heads are forward, showing their haste. Arms are extended and motioning back and forth as they move through the doorway."&lt;ref name="GAATES" /&gt;

The accessible exit signs are now being produced in Australia, New Zealand, United States and United Kingdom, also featuring [[braille]] and [[Somatosensory system|tactile]] lettering suitable for people that have low vision or are blind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Accessible Signs in New Zealand|journal=The Professional Engineer|date=February 2015|issue= 85|pages=3|url=http://www.professionalengineers-uk.org/pdfs/newsletters/ProEng-issue85.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is intended to show where wheelchair accessible exit routes, evacuation lifts, evacuation devices and areas of refuge are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Mark|title=Accessible Exit Signs|url=http://www.interactiveaccessibility.com/news/accessible-exit-signs |publisher=Interactive Accessibility|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept also provides more intuitive building design to assist people that are blind or have low vision to locate an exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Lee|title=Planning for Evacuating People with Disability|journal=International Fire Protection Magazine|date=March 2015|issue=61|pages=48–50|url=http://ifpmag.mdmpublishing.com/|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design also meets the intent of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] which requires signatory countries to consider the need for universal design in buildings.

[[File:Flaming cocktails.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.36|[[Flaming beverage|Flaming cocktails]] with a flash point lower than room temperature.]]
The '''flash point''' of a [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] material is the lowest [[temperature]] at which vapours of the material will [[combustion|ignite]], when given an ignition source. 

The flash point is sometimes confused with the [[autoignition temperature]], the temperature that results in spontaneous autoignition. The [[fire point]] is the lowest temperature at which vapors of the material will keep burning after the ignition source is removed. The fire point is higher than the '''flash point''', because at the flash point more vapor may not be produced rapidly enough to sustain combustion.&lt;ref&gt;Sea Transport of Petroleum, Jansen and Hayes, Ainsley, South Shields 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Neither flash point nor fire point depends directly on the ignition source temperature, but ignition source temperature is far higher than either the flash or fire point.

==Fuels==
The flash point is a descriptive characteristic that is used to distinguish between [[Flammability|flammable]] fuels, such as [[petrol]] (gasoline in the US), and [[Combustion|combustible]] fuels, such as [[diesel fuel|diesel]].

It is also used to characterize the [[Fire safety|fire hazards]] of fuels. Fuels which have a flash point less than {{convert|37.8|C}} are called flammable, whereas fuels having a flash point above that temperature are called combustible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfpa.org/catalog/product.asp?pid=3012&amp;title=2012-NFPA-30-Flammable-and-Combustible-Liquids-Code&amp;category_name=Codes_and_Standards&amp;target_pid=3012&amp;source_pid=3012&amp;link_type=edition_change NFPA 30: Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code, 2012 Edition] Nfpa.org, Retrieved January 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
All [[liquid]]s have a specific [[vapor pressure]], which is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of that liquid's [[temperature]] and is subject to [[Boyle's Law]]. As temperature increases, vapor pressure increases. As vapor pressure increases, the concentration of vapor of a flammable or combustible liquid in the air increases. Hence, temperature determines the concentration of vapor of the flammable liquid in the air. A certain concentration of a flammable or combustible vapor is necessary to sustain combustion in air, the [[lower flammable limit]], and that concentration is different and is specific to each flammable or combustible liquid. The flash point is the lowest temperature at which there will be enough flammable vapor to induce ignition when an ignition source is applied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.researchinventy.com/papers/v7i2/D07022124.pdf|format=PDF|journal=International Journal of Engineering and Science|volume=7|date=February 2017|pages=21–24|title=Effect of Free Water and Rust on Flash Point of Diesel|author1=Arunachaleshwara PR|author2=Rajesh Kanna|author3=Sreeraj G Nair|author4=Cifin Francis|author5=Nishanth Bhakthan|author6=Alvin Kuruvila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
There are two basic types of flash point measurement: '''open cup''' and '''closed cup'''.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen and Hyams.pp62&lt;/ref&gt; In '''open cup''' devices, the sample is contained in an open cup which is heated and, at intervals, a flame brought over the surface. The measured flash point will actually vary with the height of the flame above the liquid surface and, at sufficient height, the measured flash point temperature will coincide with the [[fire point]]. The best-known example is the [[Cleveland open cup method|Cleveland open cup]] (COC).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.astm.org/Standards/D92.htm "Standard Test Method for Flash and Fire Points by Cleveland Open Cup Tester"], ASTM.org&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of closed cup testers: non-equilibrial, such as Pensky-Martens, where the vapours above the liquid are not in temperature equilibrium with the liquid, and equilibrial, such as Small Scale (commonly known as Setaflash), where the vapours are deemed to be in temperature equilibrium with the liquid. In both these types, the cups are sealed with a lid through which the ignition source can be introduced. Closed cup testers normally give lower values for the flash point than open cup (typically {{convert|5|-|10|C-change|0|disp=or}} lower) and are a better approximation to the temperature at which the vapour pressure reaches the [[lower flammable limit]].

The flash point is an empirical measurement rather than a fundamental physical parameter. The measured value will vary with equipment and test protocol variations, including temperature ramp rate (in automated testers), time allowed for the sample to equilibrate, sample volume and whether the sample is stirred.

Methods for determining the flash point of a liquid are specified in many standards. For example, testing by the [[Pensky-Martens closed cup]] method is detailed in [[ASTM]] D93, IP34, ISO 2719, DIN 51758, JIS K2265 and AFNOR M07-019. Determination of flash point by the Small Scale closed cup method is detailed in ASTM D3828 and D3278, EN ISO 3679 and 3680, and IP 523 and 524.

CEN/TR 15138 Guide to Flash Point Testing and ISO TR 29662 Guidance for Flash Point Testing cover the key aspects of flash point testing.

[[Gasoline]] (petrol) is a fuel used in a [[spark-ignition engine]]. The fuel is mixed with air within its flammable limits and heated by compression and subject to [[Boyle's Law]] above its flash point, then ignited by the [[spark plug]]. To ignite, the fuel must have a low flash point, but in order to avoid [[Engine knocking|preignition]] caused by residual heat in a hot combustion chamber, the fuel must have a high [[autoignition temperature]].

[[Diesel fuel]] flash points vary between {{convert|52|and|96|C|F}}. Diesel is suitable for use in a [[diesel engine|compression-ignition engine]]. Air is [[gas compressor|compressed]] until it has been heated above the [[autoignition temperature]] of the fuel, which is then injected as a high-pressure spray, keeping the fuel–air mix within flammable limits. In a diesel-fueled engine, there is no ignition source (such as the spark plugs in a gasoline engine). Consequently, diesel fuel must have a high flash point and a low autoignition temperature.

[[Jet fuel]] flash points also vary with the composition of the fuel. Both Jet A and Jet A-1 have flash points between {{convert|38|and|66|C|F}}, close to that of off-the-shelf kerosene. Yet both Jet B and JP-4 have flash points between {{convert|-23|and|-1|C|F}}.

==Standardization==
[[File:APM-932hd-1.png|thumb| Automatic [[Pensky-Martens closed cup]] tester with an integrated fire extinguisher]]
Flash points of substances are measured according to standard test methods described and defined in a 1938 publication by T.L. Ainsley of South Shields entitled "Sea Transport of Petroleum" (Capt. P. Jansen). The test methodology defines the apparatus required to carry out the measurement, key test parameters, the procedure for the operator or automated apparatus to follow, and the precision of the test method. Standard test methods are written and controlled by a number of national and international committees and organizations. The three main bodies are the CEN / ISO Joint Working Group on Flash Point (JWG-FP), ASTM D02.8B Flammability Section and the Energy Institute's TMS SC-B-4 Flammability Panel.

A '''gristmill''' (also: '''grist mill''', '''corn mill''' or '''flour mill''') grinds [[cereal]] [[grain]] into [[flour]] and [[Wheat middlings|middlings]].  The term can refer to both the [[Mill (grinding)|grinding mechanism]] and the building that holds it.

==History==

===Early history===
{{Main|Watermill}}
{{See also|List of ancient watermills|List of early medieval watermills}}
[[File:Senenu Grinding Grain, ca. 1352-1336 B.C..jpg|thumbnail|left|Senenu Grinding Grain, ca. 1352-1336 B.C., The royal scribe Senenu appears here bent over a large grinding stone. This unusual sculpture seems to be an elaborate version of a [[Ushabti|shabti]], a funerary figurine placed in the tomb to work in place of the deceased in the hereafter. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
[[Image:Millstone Anatomy.jpg|upright|thumb|The basic anatomy of a millstone. This diagram depicts a runner stone.]]

The Greek geographer [[Strabo]] reports in his ''Geography'' a water-powered grain-mill to have existed near the palace of king [[Mithradates VI Eupator]] at [[Cabira]], [[Asia Minor]], before 71 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|1985|p=160}}; {{harvnb|Wikander|2000|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flour mill 20050723 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grinding mechanism in an old Swedish flour mill]]
The early mills had horizontal paddle wheels, an arrangement which later became known as the "[[Water wheel#Vertical axis|Norse wheel]]", as many were found in Scandinavia.&lt;ref name="Denny"&gt;{{cite book|last=Denny|first= Mark|title=Ingenium: five machines that changed the world |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |date=4 May 2007|pages=36–38|chapter=Waterwheels and Windmills|isbn=0-8018-8586-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OlGoFBIb-GEC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=norse+wheel#v=onepage&amp;q=norse%20wheel&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paddle wheel was attached to a shaft which was, in turn, attached to the centre of the [[millstone]] called the "runner stone". The turning force produced by the water on the paddles was transferred directly to the runner stone, causing it to grind against a stationary "[[Mill machinery#Watermill machinery|bed]]", a stone of a similar size and shape.&lt;ref name="Denny"/&gt; This simple arrangement required no [[gear]]s, but had the disadvantage that the speed of rotation of the stone was dependent on the volume and flow of water available and was, therefore, only suitable for use in mountainous regions with fast-flowing streams.&lt;ref name="Denny"/&gt; This dependence on the volume and speed of flow of the water also meant that the speed of rotation of the stone was highly variable and the optimum grinding speed could not always be maintained.&lt;ref name="Denny"/&gt;

[[Undershot wheel|Vertical wheels]] were in use in the [[Roman Empire]] by the end of the first century BC, and these were described by [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref name="Oleson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oleson|first=John Peter|author-link = John Peter Oleson|title=Greek and Roman mechanical water-lifting devices: the history of a technology|publisher=Springer |date=30 Jun 1984|page=373|isbn=90-277-1693-5|id= {{ASIN|9027716935|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The peak of Roman technology is probably the [[Barbegal aqueduct and mill]] where water with a 19-metre fall drove sixteen water wheels, giving a grinding capacity estimated at 2.4 to 3.2 tonnes per hour.  Water mills seem to have remained in use during the post-Roman period, and by 1000 AD, mills in Europe were rarely more than a few miles apart.

[[File:Decew Falls.JPG|thumb|left|The old water mill at Decew Falls, Niagara Escarpment, St. Catharines, Canada]]
In England, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey of 1086]] gives a precise count of England's water-powered flour mills: there were 5,624, or about one for every 300 inhabitants, and this was probably typical throughout western and southern Europe. From this time onward, water wheels began to be used for purposes other than grist milling. In England, the number of mills in operation followed population growth, and peaked at around 17,000 by 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Gimpel, J., ''The Medieval Machine'', Gollanz, 1976, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited extant examples of gristmills can be found in Europe from the [[High Middle Ages]].  An extant well-preserved waterwheel and gristmill on the [[Ebro River]] in Spain is associated with the [[Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda]], built by the [[Cistercian|Cistercian monks]] in 1202.  The Cistercians were known for their use of this technology in Western Europe in the period 1100 to 1350.

Geared gristmills were also built in the medieval [[Near East]] and [[North Africa]], which were used for grinding grain and other seeds to produce [[Flour|meals]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1996), "Engineering", p. 781, in {{Harv|Rashed|Morelon|1996|pp=751–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gristmills in the Islamic world were powered by both water and wind. The first [[Windmill|wind-powered]] gristmills were built in the 9th and 10th centuries in what are now Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran.&lt;ref name=Lucas-65&gt;Adam Lucas (2006), ''Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology'', p. 65, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-14649-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical British and American mills===

Although the terms "gristmill" or "corn mill" can refer to any mill that grinds grain, the terms were used historically for a local mill where farmers brought their own grain and received back ground meal or flour, minus a percentage called the "miller's toll."&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{cite web|title=ARTFL Project: Webster Dictionary, 1913|publisher=The University of Chicago - Department of Romance Languages and Literature|url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=gristmill|accessdate=2006-09-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313061138/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=gristmill|archivedate=2007-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early mills were almost always built and supported by farming communities and the miller received the "miller's toll" in lieu of wages. Most towns and villages had their own mill so that local farmers could easily transport their grain there to be milled. These communities were dependent on their local mill as bread was a staple part of the diet.

Classical mill designs are usually [[water mill|water-powered]], though some are powered by the wind or by livestock.  In a watermill a [[sluice]] gate is opened to allow water to flow onto, or under, a [[water wheel]] to make it turn.  In most watermills the water wheel was mounted vertically, i.e., edge-on, in the water, but in some cases horizontally (the tub wheel and so-called [[Water wheel#Horizontal wheel|Norse wheel]]). Later designs incorporated horizontal steel or cast iron [[turbines]] and these were sometimes refitted into the old wheel mills.

In most wheel-driven mills, a large gear-wheel called the ''[[Mill machinery#Pit Wheel|pit wheel]]'' is mounted on the same axle as the water wheel and this drives a smaller gear-wheel, the ''[[Mill machinery#wallower|wallower]]'', on a main [[driveshaft]] running vertically from the bottom to the top of the building.  This system of gearing ensures that the main shaft turns faster than the water wheel, which typically rotates at around 10 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]].

The millstones themselves turn at around 120 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]].  They are laid one on top of the other. The bottom stone, called the ''bed'', is fixed to the floor, while the top stone, the ''[[Runner stone|runner]]'', is mounted on a separate spindle, driven by the main shaft.  A wheel called the ''[[Mill machinery#stone nut|stone nut]]'' connects the runner's spindle to the main shaft, and this can be moved out of the way to disconnect the stone and stop it turning, leaving the main shaft turning to drive other machinery.  This might include driving a mechanical [[sieve]] to refine the flour, or turning a wooden drum to wind up a chain used to hoist sacks of grain to the top of the mill house. The distance between the stones can be varied to produce the grade of flour required; moving the stones closer together produces finer flour.

The grain is lifted in sacks onto the ''sack floor'' at the top of the mill on the [[hoist (device)|hoist]]. The sacks are then emptied into bins, where the grain falls down through a hopper to the millstones on the ''stone floor'' below. The flow of grain is regulated by shaking it in a gently sloping trough (the ''slipper'') from which it falls into a hole in the center of the runner stone. The milled grain (flour) is collected as it emerges through the grooves in the runner stone from the outer rim of the stones and is fed down a chute to be collected in [[flour sack|sacks]] on the ground or ''meal'' floor. A similar process is used for grains such as [[wheat]] to make flour, and for [[maize]] to make [[corn meal]].

In order to prevent the vibrations of the mill machinery from shaking the building apart, a gristmill will often have at least two separate foundations.

American inventor [[Oliver Evans]] revolutionized this labor-intensive process at the end of the eighteenth century when he patented and promoted a fully automated mill design.

==Modern mills==
[[File:Tartu Mill 03.jpg|thumb|Modern mills are highly automated. Interior in [[Tartu Mill]], that is the biggest grain milling company in the [[Baltic states]].]]
[[File:Pittsburg August 2015 10 (Pilgrim's Pride feed mill).jpg|thumb|The [[Pilgrim's Pride]] feed mill in [[Pittsburg, Texas]], in August 2015]]

Modern mills typically use electricity or [[fossil fuels]] to spin heavy steel, or cast iron, serrated and flat rollers to separate the [[Whole grain|bran and germ]] from the [[endosperm]]. The endosperm is ground to create white flour, which may be recombined with the bran and germ to create whole grain or [[graham flour]]. The different milling techniques produce visibly different results, but can be made to produce nutritionally and functionally equivalent output. Stone-ground flour is, however, preferred by many bakers and natural food advocates because of its texture, nutty flavour, and the belief that it is nutritionally superior and has a better baking quality than steel-roller-milled flour.&lt;ref name="EAP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soilandhealth.org/06clipfile/Nutritional%20charateristics%20of%20organic%20freshly%20stone%20-%20ground.htm|title=NUTRITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS of ORGANIC, FRESHLY STONE-GROUND, SOURDOUGH &amp; - CONVENTIONAL BREADS |last=Campbell|first=Judy |author2=Mechtild Hauser |author3=Stuart Hill|year=1991|work=Ecological Agriculture Projects Publications|publisher=Ecological Agriculture Projects|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that, as the stones grind relatively slowly, the wheat germ is not exposed to the sort of excessive temperatures that could cause the fat from the germ portion to [[Beta oxidation|oxidize]] and become rancid, which would destroy some of the vitamin content.&lt;ref name="EAP" /&gt; Stone-milled flour has been found to be relatively high in thiamin, compared to roller-milled flour, especially when milled from hard wheat.&lt;ref name="EAP" /&gt;

Gristmills only grind "clean" grains from which stalks and [[chaff]] have previously been removed, but historically some mills also housed equipment for [[threshing]], sorting, and cleaning prior to grinding.

Modern mills are usually "merchant mills" that are either privately owned and accept money or trade for milling grains or are owned by corporations that buy unmilled grain and then own the flour produced.

== Pests ==
One common pest found in flour mills is the [[Mediterranean flour moth]]. Moth larvae produce a web-like material that clogs machinery, sometimes causing grain mills to shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/mediterranean-flour-moth|title=Mediterranean Flour Moth (Department of Entomology)|website=Department of Entomology (Penn State University)|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Infrastructure]] before 1700 consisted mainly of roads and canals. Canals were used for transportation or for irrigation. Sea navigation was aided by ports and lighthouses. A few advanced cities had [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] that serviced public fountains and baths, while fewer had [[Sanitary sewer|sewers]].

The earliest railways were used in mines or to bypass waterfalls, and were pulled by horses or by people. In 1811 [[John Blenkinsop]] designed the first successful and practical railway locomotive,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and a line was built connecting the Middleton Colliery to [[Leeds]].

The electrical telegraph was first successfully demonstrated on 25 July 1837 between [[Euston railway station|Euston]] and [[Camden Town]] in London.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It entered [[commerce|commercial]] use on the [[Great Western Railway]] over the {{convert|13|mi|km}} from [[Paddington station]] to [[West Drayton]] on 9 April 1839. In 1876, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] achieved the first successful telephone transmission of clear speech. Soon, a bell was added for signalling, and then a switch-hook, and telephones took advantage of the [[Telephone exchange|exchange]] principle already employed in telegraph networks.

In 1863 the [[London Underground]] was created. In 1890, it first started using electric traction and deep-level tunnels. At the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Exposition of 1878]], electric [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] had been installed along the Avenue de l'Opera and the Place de l'Opera. In 1925, [[Italy]] was the first country to build a freeway-like road, which linked [[Milan]] to [[Como]].

In 1982, the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] (TCP/IP) was standardised and the concept of a world-wide network of fully interconnected TCP/IP networks called the [[Internet]] was introduced.

=== Before 1700 ===
Infrastructure before 1700 consisted mainly of roads and canals. Canals were used for transportation or for irrigation. Sea navigation was aided by ports and lighthouses. A few advanced cities had [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] that serviced public fountains and baths, while fewer had [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s.

;Roads
The first roads were tracks that often followed [[Game (food)|game]] [[trail]]s, such as the [[Natchez Trace]].&lt;ref&gt;Lay, M G (1992). Ways of the World. Sydney: Primavera Press. pp. 401. {{ISBN|1-875368-05-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first paved streets appear to have been built in [[Ur]] in 4000 BCE. [[Corduroy road]]s were built in [[Glastonbury]], [[England]] in 3300 BCE&lt;ref name="Lay 1992"&gt;Lay (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and brick-paved roads were built in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] on the [[Indian subcontinent]] from around the same time. In 500 BCE, [[Darius I the Great]] started an extensive road system in [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]), including the [[Royal Road]].

With the rise of the [[Roman Empire]], the Romans built [[Roman road|roads]] using deep roadbeds of crushed stone as an underlying layer to ensure that they kept dry. On the more heavily travelled routes, there were additional layers that included six sided capstones, or pavers, that reduced the dust and reduced the [[drag (physics)|drag]] from [[wheel]]s.

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], many roads were built throughout the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arab Empire]]. The most sophisticated roads were those of the [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], which were paved with [[tar]] in the 8th century.&lt;ref name=Ajram&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Kasem Ajram|title=The Miracle of Islam Science|edition=2nd|publisher=Knowledge House Publishers|year=1992|isbn=0-911119-43-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Canals and irrigation systems
The oldest known canals were built in [[Mesopotamia]] c. 4000 BCE, in what is now [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]]. The [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] in [[Indian subcontinent|India and Pakistan]] from c3300 BCE had a sophisticated canal [[irrigation]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rodda|2004|p=161.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Egypt]], canals date back to at least 2300 BCE, when a canal was built to bypass the [[Cataracts of the Nile|cataract]] on the Nile near [[Aswan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hadfield|1986|p=16.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], large canals for river transport were established as far back as the [[Warring States]] (481-221 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|1971|p=269.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By far the longest canal was the [[Grand Canal of China]] completed in 609 CE, still the longest canal in the world today at {{convert|1794|km|mi}}.

In [[Europe]], canal building began in the [[Middle Ages]] because of commercial expansion from the 12th century. Notable canals were the [[Stecknitz Canal]] in Germany in 1398, the [[Briare Canal]] connecting the [[Loire]] and [[Seine]] in France in 1642, followed by the [[Canal du Midi]] in 1683 connecting the [[Atlantic]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. Canal building progressed steadily in Germany in the 17th and 18th centuries with three great rivers, the [[Elbe]], [[Oder]], and [[Weser]] being linked by canals.

=== 1700 to 1870 ===
;Roads
As traffic levels increased in England and roads deteriorated, [[toll road]]s were built by ''Turnpike Trusts'', especially between 1730 and 1770. Turnpikes were also later built in the [[United States]]. They were usually built by private companies under a government [[Franchising|franchise]].

Water transport on rivers and [[canals]] carried many farm goods from the US frontier between the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and [[Mississippi River]] in the early 19th century, but the shorter road route over the mountains had advantages.

In France, [[Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet]] is widely credited with establishing the first [[Scientific method|scientific approach]] to [[road building]] about the year 1764. It involved a layer of large rocks, covered by a layer of smaller gravel. [[John Loudon McAdam]] (1756–1836) designed the first modern highways, and developed an inexpensive paving material of soil and stone aggregate known as [[macadam]].&lt;ref name="Lay 1992"/&gt;

;Canals
In Europe, particularly Britain and Ireland, and then in the early US and the Canadian colonies, inland canals preceded the development of [[railroad]]s during the earliest phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In Britain between 1760 and 1820 over one hundred canals were built.

In the United States, navigable canals reached into isolated areas and brought them in touch with the world beyond. By 1825 the [[Erie Canal]], {{convert|363|mi|km}} long with 82 locks, opened up a connection from the populated northeast to the fertile [[Great Plains]]. During the 19th century, the length of canals grew from {{convert|100|mi|km}} to over {{convert|4000|mi|km}}, with a complex network in conjunction with [[Canada]] making the [[Great Lakes]] navigable, although some canals were later drained and used as [[Right-of-way (railroad)|railroad rights-of-way]].

;Railways
The earliest railways were used in mines or to bypass waterfalls, and were pulled by horses or by people. In 1811 [[John Blenkinsop]] designed the first successful and practical railway locomotive,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9001800| title=John Blenkinsop| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica| accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a line was built connecting the Middleton Colliery to [[Leeds]]. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RAliverpool.htm |title=Liverpool and Manchester |accessdate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918230754/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RAliverpool.htm |archivedate=2007-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; considered to be the world's first intercity line, opened in 1826. In the following years, railways spread throughout the United Kingdom and the world, and became the dominant means of land transport for nearly a century.

In the US, the 1826 [[Granite Railway]] in [[Massachusetts]] was the first commercial railroad to evolve through continuous operations into a [[common carrier]]. The [[Baltimore and Ohio]], opened in 1830, was the first to evolve into a major system. In 1869, the symbolically important [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]] was completed in the US with the driving of a golden spike at [[Promontory, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Nothing Like It In The World; The men who built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863–1869| author=Ambrose, Stephen E.| year=2000| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| isbn=0-684-84609-8| authorlink=Stephen E. Ambrose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Telegraph service
The electrical telegraph was first successfully demonstrated on 25 July 1837 between [[Euston railway station|Euston]] and [[Camden Town]] in London.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/Daysout/BTArchives/Profile/index.htm The electric telegraph, forerunner of the internet, celebrates 170 years] BT Group Connected Earth Online Museum. Accessed July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It entered [[commerce|commercial]] use on the [[Great Western Railway]] over the {{convert|13|mi|km}} from [[Paddington station]] to [[West Drayton]] on 9 April 1839.

In the United States, the telegraph was developed by [[Samuel F. B. Morse|Samuel Morse]] and [[Alfred Vail]]. On 24 May 1844, Morse made the first public demonstration of his telegraph by sending a message from the Supreme Court Chamber in the [[US Capitol]] in [[Washington, DC]] to the B&amp;O Railroad outer depot (now the B&amp;O Railroad Museum) in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. The Morse/Vail telegraph was quickly deployed in the following two decades. On 24 October 1861, the [[first transcontinental telegraph]] system was established.

The first successful [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] was completed on 27 July 1866, allowing transatlantic telegraph communications for the first time. Within 29 years of its first installation at Euston Station, the telegraph network crossed the oceans to every continent but Antarctica, making instant global [[communication]] possible for the first time.

=== 1870 to 1920 ===
;Roads
Tar-bound macadam, or [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]], was applied to macadam roads towards the end of the 19th century in cities such as [[Paris]].  In the early 20th century tarmac and concrete paving were extended into the countryside.

;Canals
Many notable sea canals were completed in this period, such as the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869, the [[Kiel Canal]] in 1897, and the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914.

;Telephone service
In 1876, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] achieved the first successful telephone transmission of clear speech. The first telephones had no network, but were in private use, wired together in pairs. Users who wanted to talk to different people had as many telephones as necessary for the purpose. A user who wished to speak, whistled into the transmitter until the other party heard. Soon, however, a bell was added for signalling, and then a switch-hook, and telephones took advantage of the [[Telephone exchange|exchange]] principle already employed in telegraph networks. Each telephone was wired to a local [[telephone exchange]], and the exchanges were wired together with [[trunking|trunks]]. Networks were connected together in a hierarchical manner until they spanned cities, countries, continents, and oceans.

;Electricity
At the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Exposition of 1878]], electric [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] had been installed along the Avenue de l'Opera and the Place de l'Opera, using electric [[Yablochkov candle|Yablochkov arc lamps]], powered by [[Zénobe Gramme]] alternating current dynamos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/measureforgreatn001419mbp/measureforgreatn001419mbp_djvu.txt|title=A Measure for Greatness: A Short Biography of Edward Weston|author=David Oakes Woodbury|year=1949|publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=83|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electricity at the Columbian Exposition|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lF5KAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3|page=1|author=John Patrick Barrett|accessdate=2009-01-04|publisher=R. R. Donnelley &amp; sons company|year=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yablochkov candles required [[high voltage]]s, and it was not long before experimenters reported that the arc lights could be powered on a seven-mile (11&amp;nbsp;km) circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers|author1=Engineers, Institution of Electrical|volume=IX|date=1880-03-24|title=Notes on the Jablochkoff System of Electric Lighting|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lww4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA143|issue=32|page=143|accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a decade scores of cities would have lighting systems using a central power plant that provided electricity to multiple customers via electrical transmission lines. These systems were in direct competition with the dominant [[gas lighting|gaslight]] utilities of the period.

The first electricity system supplying [[incandescent light]]s was built by the [[Edison Illuminating Company]] in lower Manhattan, eventually serving one square mile with six "jumbo dynamos" housed at [[Pearl Street Station]].

The first transmission of [[three-phase]] [[alternating current]] using high voltage took place in 1891 during the [[International Electro-Technical Exhibition – 1891|International Electro-Technical Exhibition]] in [[Frankfurt]]. A 25&amp;nbsp;kilovolt transmission line, approximately {{convert|175|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, connected [[Lauffen, Baden-Württemberg|Lauffen]] on the [[Neckar]] with [[Frankfurt]]. Voltages used for electric power transmission increased throughout the 20th century. By 1914 fifty-five transmission systems operating at more than 70,000&amp;nbsp;V were in service, the highest voltage then being used was 150,000&amp;nbsp; V.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Census data reprinted in Hughes, pp. 282–283&lt;/ref&gt;

;Water distribution and sewers
In the 19th century major treatment works were built in [[London water supply infrastructure|London]] in response to [[cholera]] threats. The [[Metropolis Water Act 1852]] was enacted. "Under the Act, it became unlawful for any water company to extract water for domestic use from the tidal reaches of the Thames after 31 August 1855, and from 31 December 1855 all such water was required to be effectively filtered. The ''Metropolitan Commission of Sewers'' was formed, water filtration was made compulsory, and new water intakes on the Thames were established above Teddington Lock.

The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied [[chlorine gas]] was developed in 1910 by [[US Army]] [[Major]] [[Carl Rogers Darnall]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[Army Medical School]]. Darnall's work became the basis for present day systems of municipal [[water purification]].

;Subways
In 1863 the [[London Underground]] was created. In 1890, it first started using electric traction and deep-level tunnels. Soon afterwards, [[Budapest]] and many other cities started using subway systems. By 1940, nineteen subway systems were in use.

=== Since 1920 ===
[[File:401 widest point.jpg|thumb|A multi-lane, multi-carriageway [[freeway]]]]
;Roads
In 1925, [[Italy]] was the first country to build a freeway-like road, which linked [[Milan]] to [[Como]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hofmann, "Taking to the Highway in Italy", ''[[New York Times]]'', 26 April 1987, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Autostrada dei Laghi]]. In [[Germany]], the [[autobahns]] formed the first limited-access, high-speed road network in the world, with the first section from [[Frankfurt am Main]] to [[Darmstadt]] opening in 1935. The first long-distance rural freeway in the United States is generally considered to be the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], which opened on October 1, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Patton, ''The Open Road: A Celebration of the American Highway (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the [[Interstate Highway]] System was authorised by the [[Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956]].&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news  | title = The cracks are showing | publisher = ''The Economist'' | date = 2008-06-26 | url = http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates displayStory.cfm?story_id=11636517 | accessdate = 2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the system was completed between 1960 and 1990.
;The Internet
{{Main |History of the Internet |History of the World Wide Web}}
Research into [[packet switching]] started in the early 1960s. The [[ARPANET]] in particular led to the development of protocols for [[internetworking]], where multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks
The first two nodes of what would become the [[ARPANET]] were interconnected on 29 October 1969.&lt;ref name="NetValley"&gt;[http://www.netvalley.com/intval.html "Roads and Crossroads of Internet History"] by Gregory Gromov. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) developed the [[CSNET|Computer Science Network]] (CSNET).  In 1982, the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] (TCP/IP) was standardised and the concept of a world-wide network of fully interconnected TCP/IP networks called the [[Internet]] was introduced. TCP/IP network access expanded again in 1986 when the National Science Foundation Network ([[NSFNET]]) provided access to [[supercomputer]] sites in the United States from research and education organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merit.edu/about/history/pdf/NSFNET_final.pdf ''NSFNET: A Partnership for High-Speed Networking, Final Report 1987-1995''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210181738/http://www.merit.edu/about/history/pdf/NSFNET_final.pdf |date=2015-02-10 }}, Karen D.

[[image:Hoosier Cabinet.JPG|thumb|A Hoosier Cabinet|alt=a free-standing piece of furniture with a workspace and drawers with storage]]A '''Hoosier cabinet''' (also known as a "Hoosier") is a type of [[cupboard]] or free–standing [[kitchen cabinet]] that also serves as a workstation. It was popular in the first few decades of the 20th century, since most houses did not have built–in kitchen cabinetry. The Hoosier Manufacturing Co. of [[New Castle, Indiana]], was one of the earliest and largest manufacturers of this product, causing the term "Hoosier cabinet" to become a generic term for that type of furniture. By 1920, the Hoosier Manufacturing Company had sold two million cabinets.

Hoosier style cabinets were also made by dozens of other companies, and most were in the [[Hoosier State]] or located nearby. Some of the larger manufacturers were Campbell-Smith-Ritchie (Boone); Coppes Brothers and Zook (the Napanee); McDougall Company; and G. I. Sellers and Sons. Hoosier cabinets evolved over the years to include more accessories and innovations that made life easier for cooks in the kitchen. They peaked in popularity in the 1920s, and declined as homes began to be constructed with built-in kitchen cabinets and counter tops. The Hoosier Manufacturing Company was sold in 1942 and liquidated. Today, Hoosier cabinets are valued by antique collectors.

==Background==
&lt;!--[[File:Sellers Kitcheneed Cabinet 1916.png|thumb|right|300px|1916 Hoosier cabinet made by Sellers|alt=Old drawing of woman and her stand-alone kitchen cabinet]]--&gt;[[File:Kitchen LCCN2016824204.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;!--400px|--&gt;Kitchen circa 1910-1920|alt=old kitchen from 1915]]From 1890 to 1930, more houses were built in the United States than all of the country's prior years combined.&lt;ref name="Hiller87"/&gt; Very few homes had built-in kitchen cabinets during the [[19th century]], and it was not until the late 1920s that built-in cabinets became a standard kitchen furnishing.&lt;ref name="Hiller6"&gt;{{harvnb|Hiller|2009|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the 1890s, several furniture manufacturers in Indiana discovered that a stand-alone kitchen cabinet with storage and a workspace (essentially a baker's cabinet with extra storage) was easy to sell. It was a kitchen workstation with ingredient and equipment storage where the cook could complete all food preparation and not move until it was time to cook the food.&lt;ref name="Gdula18"&gt;{{harvnb|Gdula|2008|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoosier Manufacturing Company was one of those early manufacturers. In 1900, the company moved a short distance from [[Albany, Indiana]] to [[New Castle, Indiana]]. It began improving its manufacturing and distribution process, and was a strong believer in advertising. By 1906, it had 146 employees.&lt;ref name="06Indy140"&gt;{{harvnb|Indiana State Bureau of Inspection|1907|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's product was nationally promoted as a step saver, and its popularity led to the term Hoosier cabinet becoming a generic term for that style of kitchen cabinet—similar to the term kleenex (the [[facial tissue]] called [[Kleenex]] manufactured by [[Kimberly-Clark]]) becoming a generic term for facial tissues.&lt;ref name="Hiller6"/&gt;

Thus, Hoosier cabinets were very popular from 1900 to 1930. Hoosier Manufacturing sold two million cabinets from its inception to 1920, and additional cabinets were sold by the company's competitors.&lt;ref name="Hiller81"&gt;{{harvnb|Hiller|2009|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that there were approximately 20 million households in the United States at that time, as much as 10 percent of homes had Hoosier cabinets made by Hoosier Manufacturing, and an additional unknown quantity had Hoosier cabinets made by competing companies.&lt;ref name="Kennedy8"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoosier cabinets remained popular into the 1920s, but by that time houses began to be built with more modern kitchens that included built-in cabinets, counter tops, and other fixtures. Thus supplanted, the Hoosier cabinet largely disappeared. Some of the manufacturers diversified into built-in cabinets and kitchen furniture.&lt;ref name="Hiller81"/&gt; However, the [[Great Depression]] made sales even more difficult.&lt;ref name="Hiller6"/&gt; By 1935, Hoosier cabinets were considered "old fashioned".&lt;ref name="Hiller99"&gt;{{harvnb|Hiller|2009|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two largest manufacturers, Hoosier Manufacturing and G. I. Sellers and Sons, were closed in 1942 and 1950, respectively.&lt;ref name="Kennedy21"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy64"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
[[File:Sellers Cabinet ad from Richmond Times-Dispatch 1921-05-01 Page 17.png|thumb|right|&lt;!--400px|--&gt;Drawing of a Hoosier cabinet made by Sellers|alt=Old drawing of a stand-alone kitchen cabinet with hands pointing to features]]A Hoosier cabinet is a stand-alone kitchen cabinet on small [[caster]]s. It is considered an improved version of a baker's cabinet. A baker's cabinet is a table with one or more bins underneath. It has a small work surface and a shallower upper section on top of the table that was used for storing bowls, pans, and kitchen utensils. The Hoosier cabinet expands on the baker's cabinet by offering a pull-out workspace/shelf and storage for everything a cook would need.&lt;ref name="Hiller4"&gt;{{harvnb|Hiller|2009|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base section usually has one large compartment with the [[Roll-out shelf|slide-out shelf]] covered in metal that offers more workspace, and several drawers to one side. The top portion is shallower and has several smaller compartments with doors.&lt;ref name="Kennedy7"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the Hoosier cabinets are about {{convert|48|in|cm}} wide by {{convert|22|in|cm}} deep by {{convert|72|in|cm}} high.&lt;ref name="Hiller4"/&gt; In addition to their storage capacity, they offer about {{convert|40|in|cm}} of counter space that was not available in the standard kitchen of the early [[20th century]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy8"/&gt; A distinctive feature of the Hoosier cabinet is its many moving parts and accessories. As originally supplied, they were equipped with various racks and other hardware to hold and organize spices and various staples. One particularly distinctive item is the combination flour-bin/sifter, a hopper that could be used without having to remove it from the cabinet. A similar sugar bin was also common.&lt;ref name="Hiller4"/&gt; Additional accessories and innovations were added over the years.&lt;ref name="Gdula16"&gt;{{harvnb|Gdula|2008|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special glass jars were manufactured to fit the cabinet and its racks.

==Major manufacturers==
Hoosier cabinets were made mostly from the late 1890s through the 1930s, reaching their peak in popularity during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Hiller6"/&gt; The major manufacturers of Hoosier cabinets at that time were located in Indiana. Hoosier Manufacturing was the largest.&lt;ref name="Kennedy8"/&gt;

===Campbell-Smith-Ritchie Company===
[[File:Boone Kitchen Cabinets logo.png|thumb|right|&lt;!--300px|--&gt;From 1922 advertisement|alt=Old logo saying Boone Kitchen Cabinets]]The company began as Campbell &amp; Smith in 1892, and it was primarily a [[lumber yard]] and [[planing mill]]. Lebanon is the county seat of [[Boone County, Indiana]], and Campbell-Smith-Ritchie named its Hoosier-style kitchen cabinets Boone Kitchen Cabinets in honor of the county. In 1905, the lumberyard was destroyed by fire. The company built a new facility on the edge of town. By 1910, its kitchen cabinet making business was doing so well that the lumberyard portion of the business was discontinued.&lt;ref name="Kennedy123"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Indiana inspection report for 1913 described the company as engaged in manufacturing furniture and having 90&amp;nbsp;employees.&lt;ref name="14Indy180"&gt;{{harvnb|Indiana State Bureau of Inspection|1914|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the largest employer inspected in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="14Indy180"/&gt;

The company advertised nationally, and claimed its product was designed by women from all over the nation. Models of the Boone cabinets were differentiated with names such as the Mary Boone, Bertha Boone (a larger model with storage closets at each end), and Betty Boone (a small model for apartments or smaller homes). Some included a hidden ironing board. The company, like many companies, prospered until the Great Depression. Demand for Hoosier cabinets declined at the time, first because of the difficult economic times, but also because homes began to be built with built–in cabinetry in the kitchen.&lt;ref name="Kennedy124"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company responded by cutting back on employee hours and diversifying into built-in kitchen cabinets and breakfast dining sets. This strategy enabled it to survive into 1940 when it was sold. The company continued for another 18&amp;nbsp;months, but was then liquidated.&lt;ref name="Kennedy125"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coppes Brothers and Zook===
[[File:Napanee Dutch Kitchenet logo.png|thumb|right|&lt;!--300px|--&gt;From 1918 advertisement|alt=Old logo with Dutch woman profile]]The Coppes Brothers and Zook decided to concentrate on kitchen cabinets in 1914. Their manufacturing facility was located in [[Nappanee, Indiana]], and their Hoosier cabinet brand name was the Napanee Dutch Kitchenet (spelled with only one "p").&lt;ref name="Kennedy93"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using data from a study by a famous efficiency engineer ([[Harrington Emerson]]), the company claimed that their product could save 1,592 steps per day.&lt;ref name="GH192204P195"&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Coppes Bros. &amp; Zook|first=advertisement on page 195|date=1922-04-01 |title=You Do Not Know What Kitchen Work Costs You |url= |magazine=Good Housekeeping &lt;!-- Page 195 --&gt;|location=New York |publisher=International Magazine Company |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Kennedy103"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Earlier, the Coppes brothers had a sawmill business, a box manufacturing factory, and a furniture manufacturing company. An Indiana inspection report for 1913 described their company (named Coppes, Zook, and Mutschler Co. at that time) as a "saw mill, etc." and having 178 employees in a town with a population of 2,260.&lt;ref name="14Indy212"&gt;{{harvnb|Indiana State Bureau of Inspection|1914|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Right before the Great Depression started, the company began manufacturing built-in kitchen cabinets. This product was very successful, and continued for many years after the demise of the Hoosier cabinets.&lt;ref name="Kennedy9495"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoosier Manufacturing Company===
[[File:Hoosier Cabinet ad (portion) from 1922.png|thumb|right&lt;!--|350px--&gt;|Hoosier Cabinet from 1922 advertisement|alt=Old drawing of woman and her kitchen cabinet]]The Hoosier Manufacturing Co. began in [[Albany, Indiana]] in the year 1898.{{#tag:ref|Hiller says the company ''began'' in 1898, while Kennedy says the company was ''incorporated'' in 1899.&lt;ref name="Hiller5354"&gt;{{harvnb|Hiller|2009|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy17"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} The founders were glassmaker James McQuinn, his son Emmett McQuinn, and two business partners from [[Muncie, Indiana]]—John M. Maring, and Thomas Hart.&lt;ref name="Hiller5354"/&gt; Maring and Hart served as the president and vice president, respectively. The two McQuinns ran the business, with the elder McQuinn as the plant's general manager.&lt;ref name="Huston225"&gt;{{harvnb|Huston|1921|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger McQuinn was the advertising manager.&lt;ref name="Bowen410411"&gt;{{harvnb|Bowen|1902|pp=410–411}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, the company used a former furniture manufacturing plant to make a seed separator used on farms. A secondary product, a stand-alone kitchen cabinet, sold better than the seed separator—and quickly became the company's main product. Each of the early Hoosier Cabinets was hand–made.&lt;ref name="Hiller87"&gt;{{harvnb|Hiller|2009|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabinet was similar to a baker's cabinet, with storage bins below a work space and a two-door upper section. However, the Hoosier Cabinet had "meticulously organized interior storage", which enabled it to serve as a kitchen workstation with all the necessary equipment and material within arm's reach.&lt;ref name="Hiller5657"&gt;{{harvnb|Hiller|2009|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's Albany facility was destroyed by a fire in 1900. At that time, the owners decided to restart in New Castle, Indiana, which is located about {{convert|25|mi}} south of Albany.&lt;ref name="Kennedy17"/&gt; A profile of the McQuinns from a 1902 publication discussed the New Castle facility, and said that the "output of the factory now amounts to nearly 200 complete kitchen cabinets per week, and sales are made of the article in every state in the Union, and many foreign countries."&lt;ref name="Bowen410"&gt;{{harvnb|Bowen|1902|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its product, Hoosier Manufacturing's success can be attributed to its strengths in advertising, distribution, and manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Hiller59"&gt;{{harvnb|Hiller|2009|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoosier Manufacturing created its own dealer network, since some furniture dealers were not fond of a product that competed with their wares. In cases where they had no dealer, products were sold directly from the factory.&lt;ref name="Kennedy20"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was also a strong believer in advertising.{{#tag:ref|[https://books.google.com/books?id=579OAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=hoosier+manufacturing+company&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU0fa2qvvZAhVsk-AKHb43DFg4ChDoAQgmMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hoosier%20manufacturing%20company&amp;f=false Pages 17 and 18] of the June 1921 edition of ''Printers' Ink Monthly'' discusses the current (at that time) advertising campaign conducted by the Hoosier Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref name="PITandy"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Tandy |first=Edward T. |date=1921-06-01 |title=How the Hoosier Company Backs Its "Saves Steps" Slogan |magazine=Printer's Ink Monthly &lt;!-- Page 17-18 --&gt;|location=New York |publisher=Romer Publishing Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Advertising was conducted in newspapers and national magazines such as [[Ladies' Home Journal]] and [[The Saturday Evening Post]], where the reader was likely to be a woman.&lt;ref name="LHJ1922Octp181"&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Hoosier Manufacturing|first=advertisement on page 181|date=1922-10-01 |title=Win Freedom from Drudgery with the Hoosier |url= |magazine=Ladies Home Journal&lt;!-- Page 181 --&gt;|location=Philadelphia|publisher=The Curtis Publishing Company|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP1922JanP84"&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Hoosier Manufacturing|first=advertisement on page 84|date=1922-01-01 |title=The New Hoosier Beauty|url= |magazine=Saturday Evening Post&lt;!-- Page 84 --&gt;|location=Philadelphia |publisher=The Curtis Publishing Company |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, the company began streamlining its manufacturing process by using interchangeable hardware, standardizing its products, and using an assembly line.&lt;ref name="Kennedy18"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employee responsible for these innovations, Harry Hall, was also granted patents related to innovations for the cabinet and for a safety apparatus.{{#tag:ref|Harry A.

By 1913, Hoosier Manufacturing, listed as a furniture maker by Indiana factory inspectors, had 470 employees.&lt;ref name="Indy216"&gt;{{harvnb|Indiana State Bureau of Inspection|1914|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, the company sold its one millionth Hoosier Cabinet and was clearly the leader in free-standing kitchen cabinets. By 1920, two million had been sold.&lt;ref name="Kennedy20"/&gt; During its peak years, the company produced nearly 700 cabinets per day, and was the largest manufacturer of kitchen cabinets in the United States.&lt;ref name="CityOfNewC"&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free–standing kitchen cabinets began declining in popularity by 1930, and Hoosier Manufacturing responded by making kitchen cabinets that were meant to be built-in to the home. 
The company also began manufacturing kitchen tables and breakfast sets. During [[World War II]], supplies and man-power became scarce. The company was sold and liquidated in 1942.&lt;ref name="Kennedy21"/&gt;

===McDougall===
[[File:McDougall Cabinet ad (portion) from 1917.png|thumb|right&lt;!--|250px--&gt;|McDougall 1917|alt=Old drawing of two woman admiring a kitchen cabinet]]McDougall was one of the early manufacturers of a Hoosier cabinet. An advertisement from 1919 identified the McDougall as "the first kitchen cabinet".&lt;ref name="GH191907P117"&gt;{{cite magazine |last= McDougall Company|first=advertisement on page 117|date=1919-07-01 |title=And So He Bought Her a McDougall|url= |magazine=Good Housekeeping &lt;!-- Page 117 --&gt;|location=New York |publisher=International Magazine Company |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; George McDougall began the McDougall Company in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], sometime after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The company's products were [[pie safe]]s and kitchen tables. In 1898, the company name was changed to G. P. McDougall and Son. George's son Charles traveled to learn more about the furniture business, and persuaded his father to equip their kitchen tables with flour bins—a product that eventually became known as baker's cabinets. Charles also traveled to Europe and the European influence can be seen on McDougall cabinets. In 1909, a disgruntled employee set the factory on fire, destroying the entire facility.&lt;ref name="Kennedy106"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles McDougall, with several business partners, restarted the business in [[Frankfort, Indiana]], in 1910. The company was simply named McDougall Company, and Hoosier cabinets were its product. The plant utilized the latest technology available for furniture manufacturing. The McDougall Hoosier cabinet had a patented auto-front roll door that dropped down to open instead of rolling up. Its flour bin had a glass front, which enabled one to tell how much flour was in the bin.&lt;ref name="Kennedy107"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the McDougall plant had 148 employees, making it the largest (based on employees) factory in Frankfort.&lt;ref name="Indy103"&gt;{{harvnb|Indiana State Bureau of Inspection|1914|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the 1920s, the McDougall front door was changed to be similar to those used by other Hoosier cabinets. Its flour bins were also made smaller. The Great Depression was not good to the company, and it was reorganized in 1931. The company lasted only a few years longer before closing.&lt;ref name="Kennedy108"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sellers===
[[File:Sellers Kitcheneed Cabinet logo.png|thumb|right|&lt;!--200px|--&gt;From 1916 advertisement|alt=Old logo saying Sellers Kitcheneed]]The G. I. Sellers Company was founded in [[Kokomo, Indiana]], in 1888. The company made [[chifforobe]]s, cabinets, and tables—and oak was their choice material. They grew to become the second largest manufacturer of Hoosier cabinets. By 1905, their manufacturing complex covered five city blocks. During that year, their plant was destroyed by fire. In order to restart their business as soon as possible, the company purchased a furniture factory in [[Elwood, Indiana]]. At that time, the company name was changed to the G. I. Sellers and Sons Company, and manufacturing was focused on Hoosier cabinets and tables.&lt;ref name="Kennedy61"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1913, the Sellers plant employed 99 people, making it the second largest factory (based on employees) in Elwood.&lt;ref name="14Indy81"&gt;{{harvnb|Indiana State Bureau of Inspection|1914|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among features Sellers promoted were an automatic lowering flour bin, glass drawer pulls, hand-rubbed finish on oak, and ant-proof casters.&lt;ref name="Kennedy82"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1989|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company initiated a "Votes for Women" contest for little girls in 1914. Prizes were Junior Special Kitcheneed Cabinets, which were two–thirds the size of the Sellers Kitcheneed Special.&lt;ref name="GRFR191409206"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=A New Kitchen Cabinet Sales Plan |url= |magazine=Grand Rapids Furniture Record &lt;!-- Page 206 --&gt;|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |publisher=The Periodical Publishing Company |date=1914-09-01 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, Wilfred Sellers (company president) noted that the company typically produced 75,000 to 85,000 cabinets per year.&lt;ref name="Forbes19220429"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Crawford |first=R.

Forbes Publishing Co., Inc. |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sellers introduced its Kitchenaire models in 1927, which had smaller flour bins but more drawers. In the early 1930s, coloring was featured, and new products were sold such as built-in kitchen cabinets and breakfast sets. During World War II, the company had difficulty acquiring raw materials and employing skilled workers. It ceased operations in 1950.&lt;ref name="Kennedy64"/&gt;

==Other manufacturers==
Between 1899 and 1949, over 40 manufacturers of stand-alone kitchen cabinets are known to have existed, and 18 of them were located in Indiana.&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;{{harvnb|Star|1981|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these manufacturers had much smaller advertising budgets compared to the major manufacturers, and it can be difficult to find information about them.&lt;ref name="Kennedy8"/&gt; Factory inspectors for the state of Indiana list at least eight companies, in addition to the major manufacturers, as kitchen cabinet makers in Indiana in 1913. Those companies are Cardinal Cabinet Company ([[Wabash, Indiana|Wabash]]), Greencastle Cabinet Company ([[Greencastle, Indiana|Greencastle]]), Paul Manufacturing Company ([[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]]), Roach-Brown Manufacturing (Indianapolis), C.

One author credits the work of Philip and Phyllis Kennedy for boosting the popularity of Hoosier cabinets. The Kennedys researched the cabinet's history and procedures for restoration during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Hiller110"&gt;{{harvnb|Hiller|2009|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 book, another author discussing the Hoosier cabinet mentioned that some cooks are "scouring antique stores, farm auctions, and flea markets for this unique, and still useful, piece of Americana."&lt;ref name="Fertig322"&gt;{{harvnb|Fertig|1999|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restored Hoosier cabinets are often sought after for use in early-twentieth-century-style kitchens, in homes from that era or in new homes built in the styles of that era."&lt;ref name="Hiller107"/&gt; In 2004, Hoosier cabinets sold at auction were often priced at over $1,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|1000|2004|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}).&lt;ref name="IndHistSoc"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Swaim |first=Connie |date=Spring 2004 |title=The Homemaker's Friend: The Hoosier Kitchen Cabinet |url= |magazine=Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History &lt;!-- Page 26 --&gt;|location=Indianapolis, Indiana |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oak versions with all of the accessories (flour bin, sugar bin, glass spice jars, etc.) have sold for over $2,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2000|2004|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}). Cabinets without the original accessories are typically lower priced. Some of the accessories, such as the flour sifters and the spice jars made by Sneath Glass also sell quickly. As always, beware of counterfeits and Hoosier Manufacturing nameplates added to old cabinets.&lt;ref name="IndHistSoc"/&gt;

"Hoosier cabinets live on as more than inspiration for new varieties of kitchen furniture. A hundred years after their rise to prominence, restored originals and recent reproductions have become cherished objects in many a home."&lt;ref name="Hiller107"&gt;{{harvnb|Hiller|2009|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The cabinets' sheer eccentricity, combined with their attractiveness as historic artifacts, has earned them a following equal to that of any group of collectors."&lt;ref name="Hiller100"&gt;{{harvnb|Hiller|2009|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IEC 62379''' is a [[control engineering]] standard for the common control interface for networked digital audio and video products. IEC 62379 uses [[Simple Network Management Protocol]] to communicate control and monitoring information.

It is a family of standards that specifies a control framework for networked audio and video equipment and is published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]. It has been designed to provide a means for entering a common set of management commands to control the transmission across the network as well as other functions within the interfaced equipment.

==Organization==
The parts within this standard include:
* Part 1: General,
* Part 2: [[Sound|Audio]],
* Part 3: [[Video]],
* Part 4: [[Data]],
* Part 5: Transmission over networks,
* Part 6: Packet transfer service,
* Part 7: Measurement (for EBU ECN-IPM Group)

An '''indexed file''' is a [[computer file]] with an [[lookup table|index]] that allows easy [[random access]] to any [[Storage record|record]] given its file [[unique key|key]].

The key must be such that it uniquely identifies a record. If more than one index is present the other ones are called ''alternate indexes''. The indexes are created with the file and maintained by the system.

Support for indexed files is built into [[COBOL]]&lt;ref&gt;1 VS COBOL II Application Programming Language Reference, Release 4, Eighth Edition (March 1993), IBM Corporation, Department J58, Copyright International Business Machines Corporation 1984, 1993. pp. 67-73&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PL/I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=IBM Corporation|title=Enterprise PL/I for z/OS, Version 4.3, Language Reference|date=2012|page=276|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSY2V3_4.3.0/com.ibm.entpli.doc_4.3/lr/preface_plugin.htm|accessdate=Nov 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other languages with more limited I/O facilities such as [[C (programming language)|C]] support indexed files through add-on packages in a runtime library such as C-ISAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=I IBM Corporation|title=Informix C-ISAM|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/imformixcisam|accessdate=Nov 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The COBOL language supports indexed files with the following command in the &lt;code&gt;FILE CONTROL&lt;/code&gt; section
 &lt;code&gt;ORGANIZATION IS INDEXED&lt;/code&gt;

In recent systems [[relational database]]s are often used in place of indexed files.

[[File:Kipper.JPG|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Kippered "split" herring&lt;/center&gt;]]
&lt;!--Use British English per MOS:TIES--&gt;
A '''kipper''' is a whole [[herring]], a small, [[oily fish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2004/jun/oilyfishdefinition|title=What's an oily fish?|date=24 June 2004|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has been split in a [[Butterflying|butterfly fashion]] from tail to head along the dorsal ridge, gutted, salted or pickled, and [[Smoking (cooking)#Types|cold-smoked]] over smouldering woodchips (typically [[oak]]).

In the British Isles and a few North American regions, they are often eaten for breakfast. In [[Great Britain]], kippers, along with other preserved smoked or salted fish such as the [[bloater (herring)|bloater]] and [[buckling (fish)|buckling]], were also once commonly enjoyed as a [[high tea]] or [[supper]] treat, most popularly with inland and urban working-class populations before World War II.

==Terminology==
The English [[philologist]] and [[ethnographer]] [[Walter William Skeat]] derives the word from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''kippian'', to spawn. The word has various possible parallels, such as [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''kippa'' which means "to pull, snatch" and the Germanic word ''kippen'' which means "to tilt, to incline". Similarly, the Middle English ''kipe'' denotes a basket used to catch fish. Another theory traces the word kipper to the ''kip'', or small beak, that male [[salmon]] develop during the breeding season.

As a verb, ''kippering'' ("to kipper") means to preserve by rubbing with salt or other spices before drying in the open air or in smoke. 
Originally applied to the preservation of surplus fish (particularly those known as "kips," harvested during spawning runs), ''kippering'' has come to mean the preservation of any fish, poultry, beef or other meat in like manner. The process is usually enhanced by cleaning, filleting, [[butterflying]] or slicing the food to expose maximum surface area to the drying and preservative agents.

== Origin&lt;!-- this section is linked to from [[Craster kipper]] --&gt; ==
[[File:Kipperfactoryseahouses.jpg|thumb|The fish processing factory in the village of [[Seahouses]], northern England, is one of the places where the practice of kippering herrings is said to have originated]]

Although the exact origin of the kipper is unknown, this processes of slitting, gutting, and smoke-curing fish is [[History of fishing|well documented]].{{efn|The practice of smoking salmon for preservation was seen by Lewis and Clark among American Indians of the Columbia River region.}} According to [[Mark Kurlansky]], "Smoked foods almost always carry with them legends about their having been created by accident—usually the peasant hung the food too close to the fire, and then, imagine his surprise the next morning when …".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kurlansky, 2002. ''Salt: A World History'', {{ISBN|0-8027-1373-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance [[Thomas Nashe]] wrote in 1599 about a fisherman from [[Lothingland]] in the [[Great Yarmouth (borough)|Great Yarmouth area]] who discovered smoking herring by accident.&lt;ref&gt;Hone, William (Ed.) (1838) [https://books.google.com/books?id=PzsHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA569&amp;lpg=RA4-PA569&amp;dq=%22fiering+and+smoking%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dVab8FAwjR&amp;sig=ghk3bQS_khT8L-NPyoeN8t0DO3g&amp;hl=en ''The Every-day book and table book''] Vol III, pp. 569-70. R. Griffin and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Another story of the accidental invention of kipper is set in 1843, with John Woodger of [[Seahouses]] in [[Northumberland]], when fish for processing was left overnight in a room with a smoking stove.&lt;ref&gt;Trewin, Carol (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=swU53UBC1LEC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=1843,+%22john+Woodger%22+kipper&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ka-cUNHEMcrFmQXvooGICw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Gourmet Cornwall''] Page 51, Alison Hodge Publishers. {{ISBN|9780906720394}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson A and Jaine T (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bmQjAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=1843,+%22john+Woodger%22+kipper&amp;dq=1843,+%22john+Woodger%22+kipper&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ka-cUNHEMcrFmQXvooGICw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCw ''The Oxford companion to food''] Page 728, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780192806819}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These stories and others are known to be untrue because the word "kipper" long predates this. Smoking and salting of fish—in particular of spawning salmon and herring which are caught in large numbers in a short time and can be made suitable for edible storage by this practice predates 19th century Britain and indeed written history, probably going back as long as humans have been using salt to preserve food.

==Colouring==
[[File:Red herring.jpg|thumb|left|"''Red herring''": Cold smoked herring (Scottish kippers), brined so that their flesh achieves a reddish colour]]

A kipper is also sometimes referred to as a ''red herring'', although particularly strong curing is required to produce a truly red kipper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Michael Quinion|Quinion, Michael]]| year=2002| title=The Lure of the Red Herring | work=WorldWideWords | url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/herring.htm | accessdate=21 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term appears in [[The Treatise (Walter of Bibbesworth)|a mid-13th century poem]] by the Anglo-Norman poet [[Walter of Bibbesworth]], "He eteþ no ffyssh But heryng red."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter de Bibbesworth|Bibbesworth, Walter de]] (c. 1250) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hmocAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Femina&amp;dq=Femina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KcecUKrvNpGImQW0zIDoCw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCg ''Femina''] Trinity College, Cambridge MS B.14.40. 27. Anglo-Norman On-Line Hub, 2005. {{ISBN|9780955212406}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Pepys]] used it in his diary entry of 28 February 1660 "Up in the morning, and had some red herrings to our breakfast, while my boot-heel was a-mending, by the same token the boy left the hole as big as it was before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Samuel Pepys|Pepys Samuel]]| year=1893| title=The Diary of Samuel Pepys M.A. F.R.S. | work=Samuel Pepys' Diary | url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1660/02/28/index.php | accessdate=21 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dyeing of kippers was introduced as an economy measure in the [[First World War]] by avoiding the need for the long smoking processes.  This allowed the kippers to be sold quickly, easily and for a substantially greater profit.  Kippers were originally dyed using a coal tar dye called [[brown FK]] (the FK is an abbreviation of "for kippers"), kipper brown or kipper dye. Today, kippers are usually brine dyed using a natural [[annato]] dye, giving the fish a deeper orange/yellow colour.  European Community legislation limits the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of Brown FK to 0.15&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. Not all fish caught are suitable for the dyeing process, with mature fish more readily sought, because the density of their flesh improves the absorption of the dye. An ''orange kipper'' is a kipper that has been dyed orange.

Kippers from the Isle of Man and some Scottish producers are not dyed:  The smoking time is extended in the traditional manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deliaonline.com/ingredients/ingredients-a-z/Ingredients-j-l/Kippers.html|title=Kippers|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Preparation==
[[File:Kippers at Burton Bradstock.jpg|right|thumb|265px|Kippers for breakfast in England]]

"Cold-smoked" fish that have not been salted for preservation must be cooked before being eaten safely (they can be boiled, fried, grilled, [[jugged]] or roasted, for instance). "Kipper snacks" (see below) are precooked and may be eaten without further preparation. In general, oily fish are preferred for smoking as the heat is evenly dispersed by the oil, and the flesh resists flaking apart like drier species.

In the United Kingdom, kippers are often served for breakfast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fearnley-Whittingstall|first=Hugh|title=Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's herring recipes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/23/herring-recipes-hugh-fearnley-whittingstall|accessdate=2012-05-06|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; lunch or supper. In the United States, where kippers are much less commonly eaten than in the UK, they are almost always sold as either canned "kipper snacks" or in jars found in the refrigerated foods section.

==Kippers industry==
Kippers produced in the [[Isle of Man]] are exported around the world.&lt;ref name = "BBC-1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/isleofman/content/articles/2005/10/07/kippers_feature.shtml | title = Isle of Man |  publisher = [[BBC]]  | accessdate = 9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands are produced annually in the town of [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]], where two kipper houses, Moore's Kipper Yard (founded 1882)&lt;ref name = "BBC-1" /&gt; and Devereau and Son (founded 1884),&lt;ref name = "BBC-1" /&gt; smoke and export [[herring]].

[[Mallaig]], once the busiest herring port in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mallaigheritage.org.uk/exhibit/mallaig.htm |title=Mallaig and its story |publisher=Mallaig Heritage Centre |accessdate=9 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704112754/http://www.mallaigheritage.org.uk/exhibit/mallaig.htm |archivedate= 4 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is famous for its traditionally smoked kippers, as well as [[Stornoway]] kippers and [[Loch Fyne]] kippers. The harbour village of [[Craster]] in [[Northumberland]] is famed for [[Craster kipper]]s, which are prepared in a local smokehouse, sold in the village shop and exported around the world.

Connors Brothers Limited, of Black's Harbour, New Brunswick, Canada, is one of the world's largest producers of sardines and herring. Their "kippered snacks", are smoked and salted, undyed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Connors Brothers Limited]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}

==Related terms==
The [[Manx language|Manx]] word for kipper is {{lang|gv|skeddan jiarg}}, literally  ''red herring''; the Irish term is ''scadán dearg'' with the same meaning.

''Kipper time'' is the season in which fishing for salmon is forbidden in Great Britain, originally the period 3 May to 6 January, in the [[River Thames]] by an [[Act of Parliament]]. ''Kipper season'' refers (particularly among fairground workers, market workers, taxi drivers and the like) to any lean period in trade, particularly the first three or four months of the year.

The sailors of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] use the term ''kippers'' as a slang for members of the [[Royal Navy]].

The term ''kippering'' is used in [[slang]] to mean being immersed in a room filled with [[cigarette]] or other [[tobacco]] smoke.

In recent years "Kipper" has become a nickname for a member of the British political party [[UK_Independence_Party|UKIP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/04/david-cameron-kippers|title=David Cameron won't prosper by trying to outkip the Kippers|author=Andrew Rawnsley|work=the Guardian|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the popular children's books The Railway Series, and in the television show Thomas the Tank Engine and friends, The Flying Kipper is a nickname for a fast fish train usually pulled by Henry the Green Engine. This train is most notable for being involved in the story, The Flying Kipper, when Henry is involved in a serious accident that forces him into being rebuilt.

'''Lynn Townsend White Jr.''' (April 29, 1907 – March 30, 1987) was an American historian. He was a professor of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[history]] at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] from 1933 to 1937, and at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] from 1937 to 1943. He was president of [[Mills College]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], from 1943 to 1958 and a professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] from 1958 until 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hall|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn White helped to found The Society of History and Technology (SHOT) and was president from 1960 to 1962. He won the [[Pfizer Award]] for "Medieval Technology and Social Change" from the History of Science Society (HSS) and the [[Leonardo da Vinci medal]] and Dexter prize from SHOT in 1964 and 1970. He was president of the History of Science Society from 1971 to 1972.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Science Society [http://www.hssonline.org/about/society_presidents.html "The Society: Past Presidents of the History of Science Society"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212134009/http://www.hssonline.org/about/society_presidents.html |date=2013-12-12 }}, accessed 4 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of The [[Medieval Academy of America]] from 1972-1973, and the [[American Historical Association]] in 1973.

==Biography==
White began his career as medieval historian focusing on the history of Latin monasticism in [[Sicily]] during the Norman Period but realized the coming conflict in Europe would interfere with his access to source materials.&lt;ref name="Hall_196"&gt;{{harvp|Hall|1989|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Princeton he read the works of [[Lefebvre des Noëttes]], and [[Marc Bloch]].&lt;ref name="Hall_196"/&gt; This led to his first work in the history of technology, "Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages" in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|1940|pp=153–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noettes was a retired French cavalry officer who made his hobby the history of horses. He wrote that the utilization of animals in antiquity was inefficient because the ancients were limited by the technologies of their period, specifically the lack of horseshoes and a bad harness design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|1940|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; White expanded Noettes’ conclusions into a thesis of his own that encompassed the relationship of the newly realized efficient horse and the agricultural revolution of the time.

White pointed to new methods of crop rotation and plowing and tied them to the rise of manor-based collective farming and the shift in European prosperity and power from the Mediterranean to the North. White also touched on the stirrup, the [[lateen]] sail, the wheel barrow, the spinning wheel, the hand crank, water-driven mills and wind mills. He concluded: "The chief glory of the later Middle Ages was not its cathedrals or its epics or its scholasticism: it was the building for the first time in history of a complex civilization which rested not on the backs of sweating slaves or coolies but primarily on non-human power" and he credited this as well as Western primacy in technology to Western theology’s "activist" tradition and "implicit assumption of the infinite worth of even the most degraded human personality" and its "repugnance towards subjecting any man to monotonous drudgery."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|1940|pp=144–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, White published a paper titled "Christian Myth and Christian History" in which he wrote about the relationship between historians and [[Christianity]]. He wrote: "Having lost faith that God revealed himself uniquely at one single point in history, we are relapsing into the essentially static or repetitive view of the time-process typical of antiquity and of the East" and "the Virgin Mother, undefiled yet productive, bearing Christ into the world by the action of the Spirit of God, is so perfect an analogue of the most intimate experience of the soul, that powerful myth has sustained dubious history; for, to the believer, myth and history have been one" and "Christianity above all other religions has rashly insisted that its myth really happened in time" and "we stand amid the debris of our inherited religious system." White held out hope for a Christianity that celebrated its myths and made no pretensions to history, and saw Catholicism as the most progressive in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Mills College, White published on education and women, including "Women's Colleges and the Male Dominance" (1947), "Unfitting Women for Life" (1949), "Educating Women in a Man's World" (1950), and "The Future of Women's Education" (1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hall|1989|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval technology and social change==

At UCLA, he used a set of lectures from 1957 to form his best-known work, ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'' in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book revisited almost all the themes from "Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages" 22 years earlier, but included a controversial theory about the stirrup. White contended in the first section of the book that the stirrup made [[shock tactics|shock combat]] possible, and therefore had a crucial role in shaping the feudal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|1962|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed this was the motivation for [[Charles Martel]] to accelerate confiscation of church-held lands and distribute it to his knights, who would bear the cost of themselves with expensive horses in to support him in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|1962|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second section of the book, White explained the shift in power from the Mediterranean to Northern Europe as a result of increased productivity due to technological changes that produced a "heavy plow," better harnesses for horses to pull the plow, and a three-field crop rotation scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|1962|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third part of the book, he examined medieval machines that converted motion and energy. The most notable was the compound crank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|1962|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work elicited over 30 reviews, many of which were hostile. [[P. H. Sawyer]] and [[R. H. Hilton]] wrote the most scathing of the early reviews, beginning with:

"Technical determinism in historical studies has often been combined with adventurous speculations particularly attractive to those who like to have complex developments explained by simple causes. The technical determinism of Professor Lynn White Jr., however, is peculiar in that, instead of building new and provocative theories about general historical development on the basis of technical studies, he gives a misleadingly adventurist cast to old-fashioned platitudes by supporting them with a chain of obscure and dubious deductions from scanty evidence about the progress of technology."&lt;ref&gt;P. H. Sawyer and R. H. Hilton, "Technical Determinism: The Stirrup and the Plough Medieval Technology and Social Change by Lynn White, Review by: P. H. Sawyer and R. H. Hilton", ''Past &amp; Present'', No. 24 (Apr., 1963), 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the book has been in print for 51 years and still stands as a seminal work in the field.

==The historical roots of present-day ecologic crisis==
In 1967, White conjectured that the Christian influences in the Middle Ages were at the root of ecological crisis in the 20th century. He gave a lecture on December 26, 1966, titled, "The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis" at the Washington meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]], that was later published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt; White's article was based on the premise that "all forms of life modify their context", i.e. every living organism in some way alters its environment or habitat. He believed man's relationship with the [[natural environment]] was always a dynamic and interactive one, even in the Middle Ages, but marked the [[Industrial Revolution]] as a fundamental turning point in our ecological history. He suggests that at this point the hypotheses of science were married to the possibilities of technology and our ability to destroy and exploit the environment was vastly increased. Nevertheless, he also suggests that the mentality of the Industrial Revolution, that the earth was a resource for human consumption, was much older than the actuality of machinery, and has its roots in medieval Christianity and attitudes towards nature. He suggests that "what people do about their ecology depends on what they think about themselves in relation to things around them." siting the Genesis creation story he argued that Judeo-Christian theology had swept away pagan animism and normalized exploitation of the natural world&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{harvp|White|1967|p=1205}}&lt;/ref&gt; because:

#The Bible asserts man's dominion over nature and establishes a trend of [[anthropocentrism]].
#Christianity makes a distinction between man (formed in God's image) and the rest of creation, which has no "soul" or "reason" and is thus inferior.

He posited that these beliefs have led to an indifference towards nature which continues to impact in an industrial, "post-Christian" world. He concludes that applying more science and technology to the problem will not help, that it is humanity's fundamental ideas about nature that must change; we must abandon "superior, contemptuous" attitudes that makes us "willing to use it [the earth] for our slightest whim." White suggests adopting St. [[Francis of Assisi]] as a model in imagining a "democracy" of creation in which all creatures are respected and man's rule over creation is delimited.

==The debate==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
White's ideas set off an extended debate about the role of religion in creating and sustaining the West's destructive attitude towards the exploitation of the natural world. It also galvanized interest in the relationship between history, nature and the evolution of ideas, thus stimulating new fields of study like [[environmental history]] and [[ecotheology]]. Equally, however, many saw his argument as a direct attack on Christianity and other commentators think his analysis of the impact of the Bible, and especially Genesis is misguided. They argue that [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] provides man with a model of "[[stewardship (theology)|stewardship]]" rather than dominion, and asks man to take care of the world's environment. Others, such as Lewis W. Montcrief,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moncrief|first=L. W.|date=1970-10-30|title=The cultural basis for our environmental crisis|journal=Science|volume=170|issue=3957|pages=508–512|issn=0036-8075|pmid=4918765|bibcode=1970Sci...170..508M|doi=10.1126/science.170.3957.508}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that our relation to the environment has been influenced by many more varied and complex cultural/historical phenomena,and that the result we see today cannot simply be reduced to the influence of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Later responses to his article include criticism not just of the central argument but also of the validity of his suggestion "I propose Francis as a patron saint for ecologists." Jan J Boersema's article "Why is St Francis of Assisi the patron saint of ecologists?" in ''Science and Christian Belief'' 2002 (vol 14 pp.&amp;nbsp;51–77). Boersema argues that the historical evidence for Francis's status as such a patron saint is weak both in Francis' own writings and in the reliable sources about his life.

==Medieval technology and religion==
White was an historian, but had also earned a master's degree at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] and was the son of a Calvinist professor of [[Christian Ethics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|1970|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considered religion integral to the development of Western technology. From his ''Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages'' of 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|1940|pp=141–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; through his ''Dynamo and Virgin Reconsidered'' of 1958,&lt;ref&gt;In ''The American Scholar'', vol. 27, pp. 183-194.&lt;/ref&gt; to his ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'' (Oxford University Press, 1962), his work refuted the assumption that the Middle Ages were too preoccupied with theology and/or chivalry to concern themselves with technology, the assumption behind [[Henry Adams]]' antitheses of Virgin vs. dynamo, but widespread elsewhere as well.&lt;ref&gt;"Die Bourgeoisie hat enthuellt, wie the brutale Kraftauesserung, die die Reaktion so sehr am Mittelalter bewundert, in der traegsten Baerenhaeuterei ihre passende Ergaenzung fand." ''Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei'', London, 1848, in Karl Marx/Friedrich Engels, ''Werke'', Berlin, Dietz Verlag, 1969, vol. 4, p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

==White's view of writing history==
His work tied together that of many predecessors, above all that of [[Marc Bloch]], to whose memory ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'' is dedicated. White argued, "Since, until recent centuries, technology was chiefly the concern of groups which wrote little, the role which technological development plays in human affairs has been neglected," and declared, "If historians are to attempt to write the history of mankind, and not simply the history of mankind as it was viewed by the small and specialized segments of our race which have had the habit of scribbling, they must take a fresh view of the records, ask new questions of them, and use all the resources of archaeology, iconography, and etymology to find answers when no answers can be discovered in contemporary writings."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|1962|loc=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JM marbles 01.jpg|thumb|Marbles of different sizes and types]]
A '''marble''' is a small spherical toy often made from [[glass]], [[clay]], [[steel]], [[plastic]] or [[agate]]. These balls vary in size. Most commonly, they are about {{convert|1/2|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter, but they may range from less than {{convert|1/30|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} to over {{convert|3|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}, while some art glass marbles for display purposes are over {{convert|12|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} wide. Marbles can be used for a variety of [[game]]s called '''marbles'''. They are often [[Collecting|collected]], both for nostalgia and for their aesthetic colors. In the North of England the objects and the game are called "taws", with larger taws being called ''bottle washers'' after the use of a marble in [[Codd-neck bottle]]s, which were often collected for play.

==History==

In the early twentieth century, small balls of stone, identified by archaeologists as marbles, were found on excavation near [[Mohenjo-daro]].&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{cite book |editor=Marshall, John |url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=Ds_hazstxY4C&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;dq=marbles+in+mohenjo+daro&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xp4lKXfLf8&amp;sig=vUgbGxgpAoU1lqqfF_mYrlDNqcw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ssvTVJ_MFc7Wav6xgsgK&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=marbles%20in%20mohenjo%20daro&amp;f=false |title=Mohenjo-Daro and the Indus Civilization: Being an Official Account of Archaeological Excavations Carried out by the Government of India between the Years 1922 and 1927 |publisher=Asian Educational Services |location=New Delhi |year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|553}} Marbles are often mentioned in Roman literature, as in [[Ovid]]'s poem ''Nux'' (which mentions playing the game with walnuts), and there are many examples of marbles from excavations of sites associated with Chaldeans of [[Mesopotamia]] and ancient Egypt. They were commonly made of clay, stone or glass. Marbles arrived in [[Great Britain|Britain]], imported from the [[Low Countries]], during the [[Middle Ages|medieval era]].&lt;ref name=HideSeek&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joy |first1=Jody |first2=Imogen |last2=Gunn |first3=Sarah-Jane |last3=Harknett |first4=Eleanor |last4=Wilkinson |title=Hide and Seek: Looking for Children in the Past |publisher=Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge |location=Cambridge |year=2016 |url=http://www.hideandseekexhibition.org.uk/objects/21 |isbn=978-0-947595-23-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}

In 1903, [[Martin Frederick Christensen]]—also of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], Ohio—made the first machine-made glass marbles on his patented machine. His company, The M. F.

This company was started by [[Akronites]] in 1911, but located in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]].  Today, there are only two American-based toy marble manufacturers: Jabo Vitro in [[Reno, Ohio|Reno]], Ohio, and Marble King, in [[Paden City, West Virginia|Paden City]], West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1495|title=e-WV - Marbles|website=Wvencyclopedia.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, games were played with marbles of different sizes. The smallest and most common was about {{convert|15|mm|in|abbr=on|frac=8}} in diameter. The two larger, more valuable sizes were referred to as semi-bowlers and tom-bowlers, being about {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on|frac=8}} and {{convert|25|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter respectively.  They were used in much the same way as ordinary marbles, although sometimes they would be declared invalid because of the advantage of their larger mass and inertia. Owners of large marbles were also afraid to use them lest they be lost to another player as "keepsies". They were usually of the clear "cat's eye" or milk glass type, just bigger.

"Firing" a marble meant that a player had to flick his/her marble from a stationary position of his hand. No part of the hand firing the marble was permitted to be in front of the position where the marble had been resting on the ground. Using that hand, (s)he would flick or fire the marble from his/her hand, usually with the knuckle on the back of his/her hand resting on the ground, and usually using the thumb of that hand to do so. All shots of the game were conducted in this manner throughout except the very initial pitch towards the bunny hole that started the game.

Once a player was able to land his/her marble within the hole, (s)he would immediately then fire his marble at his opponents' marbles. However, if any player hit another player's marble before his/her own marble had been to 'visit' the bunny hole, the act would be referred to as "a kiss"; the game would be over, and all or both players (in the case of two players only) would have to retreat back to the starting line to restart the game, without result. This, of course, could be quite annoying or frustrating if a player had already built up quite a few hits on another player's marble. So, most skilled players did not resort to this kind of tactic.

The overall aim was to hit a particular marble 3 times after getting into the hole, then you had to "run away", before the final contact shot was allowed to be played - which was called "the kill". Once a player made a kill on another marble, if the game was 'for keeps', (s)he would then get to keep the marble [bunny] (s)he had 'killed'. The format of playing this game was that each time you successfully hit another player's marble, you were to have another shot - even if it was not the marble you had originally intended to hit.

Of course, the ploy was to hit the particular opponent marble 3 times, and then 'run away' to the bunny hole, because once you rested the marble into the hole, you immediately had your shot again, thus leaving no opportunity at all for your opponent to retreat his/her marble before "the Kill" was made on it.

{{unsourced|section|date=May 2018}}

In [[India]], there are many games with marbles. One simple game with marbles is called "Cara" in which every player puts one or more marbles in a long line of marbles with each marble being one centimeter or slightly more, apart from each other. After this, each player throws another marble as far as possible from the line, perpendicularly. In this game, the player whose marble is farthest from the line of marbles gets the first chance to hit the marble's line and subsequent players who get to hit the line have their distance from the line in decreasing order. Any player who hits and displaces a marble in the line of marbles gets to take that and all marbles to the right of it. Usually, marbles in the line are smaller marbles and the players have bigger marbles for hitting the line of smaller marbles.This game needs the playground to be flat and hard and with no loose soil for effecting games of "Cara". The number of players can be anywhere between 2 to 30. The distances of the marbles thrown determine order of players who get to hit the line are anywhere from 10 to 30 meters and may depend on player's desire to hit the marble line first and how much risk they will take so that they would be at some distance and yet be able to hit the line of marbles and get more than 2 marbles. Players have to roll their marbles from a distance to hit the line of marbles. Each player gets to hit the line of marbles only once assuming there are marbles left in the line and every player gets a turn in order. In a line of twenty marbles, its reasonable to get at least 5 to 20 marbles depending on how skillful somebody is at hitting the line of marbles. When all marbles are taken by players as above  the game is restarted with players putting their marbles in the line and trying to win as many marbles as possible.If some marbles are left in the line after each player takes a chance, the players again throw their marbles perpendicularly to this line and start to roll their marble to hit the line according to the above rules. This process is repeated until all marbles are taken in the game.

===Uganda===
In [[Uganda]], a popular marbles game is called ''dool''. It requires a small pit dug in the ground for two or more players, each with his own marble. To improvise, Ugandans also use the seeds of a [[candlenut]] tree, locally referred to as ''Kabakanjagala''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nicoletteorlemans.com/2012/06/25/young-ugandan-journalist/|title=Young Ugandan Journalist|work=Cultural Reflections|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006232434/http://nicoletteorlemans.com/2012/06/25/young-ugandan-journalist/|archivedate=2014-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[Kabaka of Buganda|King]] loves me). To start a game, a throwing line is drawn on the ground using chalk or a stick about a meter (or some feet) from the pit. Then the players roll their marbles close to the pit. The one whose marble falls in gets points equivalent to one game. If a second marble falls in and hits the first, a player gets more points than the previous player, but all have to return to the throwing line. When no marble falls in, the player whose marble rolls closest to the pit starts the firing session. When he misses, the next opponent fires. You can only fire 24 consecutive times per turn earning one point for each hit. But all that time, a player must make sure the gap between the marbles is bigger than two stretches of the hand. If an opponent realises that it isn't, then he can make a call, pick his marble and place it anywhere. When a player is targeting a marble placed near the hole, he must avoid knocking it into the hole or else give away an advantage. There are various rules for ''dool'' but the player with the most points wins. Favoured fingers include the middle finger for blasting strength and small finger for accurate long distance target.

==World championship==
The [[British and World Marbles Championship]] has been held at [[Tinsley Green]], West Sussex, England, every year since 1932.&lt;ref name="InsideOut" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collins|2007|p=88.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/apr/04/british-world-marble-championship|title=Event preview: British And World Marbles Championship, Tinsley Green|last=Aitch|first=Iain|date=4 April 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd|accessdate=13 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Marbles has been played in Tinsley Green and the surrounding area for many centuries:&lt;ref name="InsideOut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/south/series3/marbles_world_championship.shtml|title=Losing your Marbles|date=9 June 2003|work=BBC Inside Out programme|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1624160.ece|title=Village rolls out a welcome for World Marbles Championships|last=Sandy|first=Matt|date=7 April 2007|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=13 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine traces its origins to 1588.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,761077,00.html|title=Sport: At Tinsley Green|date=17 April 1939|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]|publisher=TIME Inc.|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Traditionally, the marbles-playing season started on [[Ash Wednesday]] and lasted until midday on [[Good Friday]]: playing after that brought bad luck.&lt;ref name="Collins88" /&gt;  More than 20 teams from around the world take part in the championship, each Good Friday; German teams have been successful several times since 2000,&lt;ref name="InsideOut" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/26/comment.harrypearson|title=Going under in the marble halls of Tinsley Green|last=Pearson|first=Harry|date=26 April 2003|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd|accessdate=13 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; although local teams from Crawley, [[Copthorne, West Sussex|Copthorne]] and other Sussex and [[Surrey]] villages often take part as well;&lt;ref name="InsideOut" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gwynne172"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1990|p=172.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first championship in 1932 was won by Ellen Geary, a young girl from London.

==Marble terminology==
* "Knuckle down": the position adopted at the start line at the beginning of a match. The player begins with his or her knuckle against the ground.
* "Quitsies": allows any opponent to stop the game without consequence. Players can either have "quitsies" (able to quit) or "no quitsies".
* "Keepsies" (or "for keeps"): the player keeps all the marbles he or she wins.
* "Elephant stomps": when called, it allows a player to stomp his or her marble level with the ground surface, making it very difficult for other players to hit.
* "Bombies": when called, it allows a player to take one or two steps while holding his or her marble and, while closing one eye, will line up over one of the opponent's marbles and drop the marble trying to hit the marble on the ground.
* "Leaning tops": when called, a shooter leans in on his or her off hand for leverage over an indentation on any type of surface or obstacle.
* A "taw" or "shooter" is generally a larger marble used to shoot with, and "ducks" are marbles to be shot at.
* Various names refer to the marbles' size. Any marble larger than the majority may be termed a boulder, bonker, masher, plumper, popper, shooter, thumper, smasher, taw, bumbo, crock, bumboozer, bowler, tonk, tronk, godfather, tom bowler, fourer, giant, dobber, [[dobbert]], hogger, biggie or toebreaker. A marble smaller than the majority is a peawee, peewee or mini. A "grandfather" is the largest marble, the size of a billiards ball or tennis ball.
* Various names for different marble types (regional playground talk, [[Leicester]], UK): Marleys (marbles), prit (white marble), Kong (large marble), King Kong (larger than a bosser), steely (metal bearing-ball). Names can be combined: e.g. prit-Kong (large white marble). There are many more such names, as discussed in the next section.

==Marble collecting==
[[File:Historic Marbles.jpg|thumb|left|Some historic marbles]]

Marble players often grow to collect marbles after having outgrown the game.  Marbles are [[categorize]]d by many factors including condition, size, type, manufacturer/[[artisan]], age, style, materials, scarcity, and the existence of original packaging (which is further rated in terms of condition). A marble's worth is primarily determined by type, size, condition and eye-appeal, coupled with the law of supply and demand. Ugly, but rare marbles may be valued as much as those of very fine quality. However, this is the exception, rather than the rule - "Condition is King" when it comes to marbles. Any surface damage (characterized by missing glass, such as chips or pits) typically cuts book value by 50% or more.

Due to the large market, there are many related side businesses that have sprung up such as numerous books and guides, web sites dedicated to live [[auction]]s of marbles only, and collector [[Convention (meeting)|convention]]s. Additionally, many glass artisans produce [[art marbles]] for the collectors' market only, with some selling for thousands of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BpJyCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=marbles+selling+for+thousands+of+dollars&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4ssrExbjXAhXMzaQKHbFMCwkQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Keeping Their Marbles: How the Treasures of the Past Ended Up in Museums - And Why They Should Stay There|first=Tiffany|last=Jenkins|date=25 February 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
[[File:Marble Machine, at House of Marbles - geograph.org.uk - 506883.jpg|thumb|upright|A very large American-made marble making machine at [[Bovey Tracey]], Devon, England]]

Marbles are made using many techniques. They can be categorized into two general types: [[lapidary|hand-made]] and machine-made.

Marbles were originally made by hand. [[Rock (geology)|Stone]] or [[ivory]] marbles can be fashioned by grinding. [[Clay]], [[pottery]], [[ceramic]], or [[porcelain]] marbles can be made by rolling the material into a ball, and then letting dry, or firing, and then can be left natural, painted, or [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d. Clay marbles, also known as ''crock marbles'' or ''commies'' (''common''), are made of slightly porous clay, traditionally from local clay or leftover earthenware ("crockery"), rolled into balls, then glazed and fired at low heat, creating an opaque imperfect sphere that is frequently sold as the poor boy's "old timey" marble. Glass marbles can be fashioned through the production of glass rods which are stacked together to form the desired pattern, cutting the rod into marble-sized pieces using marble scissors, and rounding the still-malleable glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/an-interview-with-antique-marble-collector-alan-basinet/|title=Agates, Corkscrews, and Onionskins: Fun with Antique Marbles|website=Collectorsweekly.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One mechanical technique is dropping globules of molten glass into a groove made by two interlocking parallel screws. As the screws rotate, the marble travels along them, gradually being shaped into a sphere as it cools. Colour is added to the main batch glass and/or to additional glass streams that are combined with the main stream in a variety of ways. For example, in the "cat's-eye" style, coloured glass veins are injected into a transparent main stream. Applying more expensive coloured glass to the surface of cheaper transparent or white glass is also a common technique.

==Manufacturing locations==
There were a lot of businesses that made marbles in [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americantoymarbles.com/akronhist.htm |title=A Brief History of the Birth of the Modern American Toy Industry|website=Americantoymarbles.com | accessdate=2009-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One major marble manufacturing company is Marble King, located in [[Paden City, West Virginia|Paden City]], West Virginia, which was featured in the television shows ''[[John Ratzenberger's Made in America|Made in America]]'', ''[[Some Assembly Required (TV series)|Some Assembly Required]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. Currently, the world's largest manufacturer of playing marbles is Vacor de Mexico. The company makes 90 percent of the world’s marbles. Over 12 million are produced daily.

Marbles are also made in China and may contain lead, arsenic, and/or cadmium due to the manufacturing process of old glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eponline.com/articles/2011/03/04/tti-study-finds-arsenic-and-lead-in-imported-glass-beads.aspx|title=TTI Study Finds Arsenic and Lead in Imported Glass Beads -- Environmental Protection|website=Eponline.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art marbles===
{{main|Art marble}}

Art marbles are high-quality collectible marbles arising out of the art glass movement.  They are sometimes referred to as contemporary glass marbles to differentiate them from collectible antique marbles, and are spherical works of art glass.

Collectible contemporary marbles are made mostly in the United States by individual artists such as [[Josh Simpson (glass artist)|Josh Simpson]].

Art marbles are usually around 50mm marble (a size also known as a "toe breaker"), but can vary, depending on the artist and the print.

==Games==
===Video games===
* ''[[Enigma_(video_game)|Enigma]]'' (2007)
* ''[[Marble Blast Gold]]'' (2003), a "get to the finish" first person game for the PC and [[Xbox]]; a sequel, ''[[Marble Blast Ultra]]'' (2006), was released later for the [[Xbox 360]].

The '''memex''' (originally coined "at random",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though sometimes said to be a [[portmanteau]] of "memory" and "index"&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt;) is the name of the hypothetical [[proto-hypertext]] system that [[Vannevar Bush]] described in his 1945 ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' article "[[As We May Think]]". Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility".  The memex would provide an "enlarged intimate supplement to one's memory".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Citation | last = Manovich | first = Lev | contribution = As We May Think | title = The New Media Reader | pages = 35 | publisher = The MIT Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the memex influenced the development of early [[hypertext]] systems (eventually leading to the creation of the [[World Wide Web]]) and [[personal knowledge base]] software.&lt;ref&gt;DAVIES, Stephen. "Still Building The Memex". ''Communications of The ACM'' 54.2 (Feb. 2011): 80–88. ''Business Source Elite''. Web. 12 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The hypothetical implementation depicted by Bush for the purpose of concrete illustration was based upon a document bookmark list of static [[microfilm]] pages and lacked a true hypertext system, where parts of pages would have internal structure beyond the common textual format. Early electronic hypertext systems were thus inspired by memex rather than modeled directly upon it.

== Details ==

=== A proto-hypertext system ===
In "[[As We May Think]]", Bush describes a memex as an electromechanical device enabling individuals to develop and read a large self-contained research library, create and follow associative trails of links and personal annotations, and recall these trails at any time to share them with other researchers. This device would closely mimic the associative processes of the human mind, but it would be gifted with permanent recollection. As Bush writes, "Thus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race".{{Sfn | Bush | 1945 | loc =Section 8}}

The technology used would have been a combination of electromechanical controls, [[microfilm]] cameras and readers, all integrated into a large desk.  Most of the microfilm library would have been contained within the desk, but the user could add or remove microfilm reels at will.  A memex would hypothetically read and write content on these microfilm reels, using electric photocells to read coded symbols recorded next to individual microfilm frames while the reels spun at high speed, stopping on command. The coded symbols would enable the memex to index, search, and link content to create and follow associative trails.

The top of the desk would have slanting translucent screens on which material could be projected for convenient reading. The top of the memex would have a transparent platen. When a longhand note, photograph, memoranda, or other things were placed on the platen, the depression of a lever would cause the item to be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex film.

The memex would become "'a sort of mechanized private file and library'.{{Sfn | Bush | 1945 | loc =Section 6}}  It would use microfilm storage, dry photography, and analog computing to give postwar scholars access to a huge, indexed repository of knowledge {{endash}} any section of which could be called up with a few keystrokes."{{Sfn | Wardrip-Fruin | Montfort | 2003 | p = 35}}

The vision of the memex predates, and is credited as the inspiration for, the first practical [[hypertext]] systems of the 1960s. Bush describes the memex and other visions of [[As We May Think]] as projections of technology known in the 1930s and 1940s {{endash}} in the spirit of [[Jules Verne]]'s adventures, or [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1945 proposal to orbit [[geosynchronous satellite]]s for global telecommunication. The memex proposed by Bush would create ''trails'' of links connecting sequences of microfilm frames, rather than links in the modern sense where a [[hyperlink]] connects a single word, phrase or picture within a document and a local or remote destination.

===Associative trails===
An associative trail as conceived by Bush would be a way to create a new ''linear'' sequence of microfilm frames across any arbitrary sequence of microfilm frames by creating a chained sequence of links in the way just described, along with personal comments and ''side trails''. At the time Bush saw the current ways of indexing information as limiting and instead proposed a way to store information that was analogous to the mental association of the human brain: storing information with the capability of easy access at a later time using certain cues (in this case, a series of numbers as a code to retrieve data).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The World Wide Web: the Beginning and Now | publisher = U Mich | last = Kaz | first = Matt | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mattkaz/history/memex3.html | contribution = Vannevar Bush and Memex}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The closest analogy with the modern Web browser would be to create a list of bookmarks to articles relevant to a topic, and then to have some mechanism for automatically scrolling through the articles (for example, use [[Google]] to search for a keyword, obtain a list of matches, repeatedly use the "open in new tab" feature of the Web browser, and then visit each tab sequentially). Modern hypertext systems with word and phrase-level linking offer more sophistication in connecting relevant information, but until the rise of [[wiki]] and other [[social software]] models, modern hypertext systems have rarely imitated Bush in providing individuals with the ability to create personal trails and share them with colleagues – or publish them widely.

===Other features===
The memex would have features other than linking. The user could record new information on microfilm, by taking photos from paper or from a touch-sensitive translucent screen. A user could "...insert a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. ...Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him."{{Sfn | Bush | 1945 | loc=Section 7}} A user could also create a copy of an interesting trail (containing references and personal annotations) and "...pass it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail."{{Sfn | Bush | 1945 | loc=Section 7}} As observers like Tim Oren have pointed out, the memex could be considered to be a microfilm-based precursor to the [[personal computer]].  The September 10, 1945, [[Life magazine]] article showed the first illustrations of what the memex desk&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/Secondary.html | publisher = Sloan | title = Mouse site | place = Stanford | contribution = Secondary}}.&lt;/ref&gt; could look like, as well as illustrations of a head-mounted [[camera]], which a scientist could wear while doing experiments, and a [[typewriter]] capable of [[speech recognition|voice recognition]] and of reading text by [[speech synthesis]]. Considered together, these memex machines were probably the earliest practical description of what we would call today the [[Office of the future]].

"Given a memex, a scholar could create her own knowledge tools as connections within reams of information, share these tools, and use complexes of tools to create yet more sophisticated knowledge that could in turn be deployed toward this work.  The memex has been envisioned as a means of turning an information explosion into a knowledge explosion. This remains one of the defining dreams of [[new media]]."{{Sfn | Wardrip-Fruin | Montfort | 2003 | p = 35}}

=== Extending, storing, and consulting the record of the species ===
Bush's idea for the memex extended far beyond a mechanism which might augment the research of one individual working in isolation. In Bush's idea, the ability to connect, annotate, and share both published works and personal trails would profoundly change the process by which the "world's record" is created and used:

{{blockquote|Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by a patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. ...

The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only on the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record. The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected. {{emdash}} ''[[As We May Think]]'' 
}}

Bush states that "technical difficulties of all sorts have been ignored," but that, "also ignored are means as yet unknown which may come any day to accelerate technical progress as violently as did the advent of the thermionic tube."{{Sfn | Bush | 1945 | loc=Section 8}}  Indeed, anyone who stops to consider the performance consequences of trail following – let alone link-directed [[pointer chasing]] – over a microfilm library of near universal scope should quickly come to the conclusion that microfilm is no more appropriate a technology for implementing AWMT's vision than [[Jules Verne]]'s cannon is an appropriate technology for sending astronauts to the Moon.  In both cases the vision may be more significant than the specific technology used to describe it. See [[Michael Buckland]]'s conclusion: "Bush's contributions in this area were twofold: (i) A significant engineering achievement by the team under his leadership in building a truly rapid prototype microfilm selector, and (ii) a speculative article, 'As We May Think,' which, through its skillful writing and the social prestige of its author, has had an immediate and lasting effect in stimulating others."&lt;ref name="Buckland"&gt;[[Michael Buckland|Buckland, Michael K.]] "Emanuel Goldberg, Electronic Document Retrieval, And Vannevar Bush's Memex". Journal of the American Society for Information Science 43, no. 4 (May 1992): 284–94&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Memex: Getting Back on the Trail",&lt;ref name="Nyce"&gt;Nyce, James M.; Kahn, Paul (eds.) "From Memex to Hypertext: Vannevar Bush and the Mind's Machine". San Diego, London (...) 1991.  [A reprint of all of Bush's texts regarding Memex accompanied by related Sources and Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Oren argues that Bush's original vision expressed in AWMT describes a "...private device into which public encyclopedias and colleague's trails might be inserted to be joined with the owner's own work."

However, in Bush's manuscript draft of "Memex II" of 1959,&lt;ref name= "Nyce"/&gt; Bush says, "Professional societies will no longer print papers..." and states that individuals will either order sets of papers to come on tape – complete with photographs and diagrams – or download 'facsimiles' by telephone. Each society would maintain a 'master memex' containing all papers, references, tables "intimately interconnected by trails, so that one may follow a detailed matter from paper to paper, going back through the classics, recording criticism in the margins."

=== Missing features: search and metadata ===
The AWMT paper did not describe any automatic search, nor any universal [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] scheme such as a standard [[library classification]] or a hypertext element set like the [[Dublin Core|Dublin core]]. Instead, when the user made an entry, such as a new or annotated manuscript, typescript or image, he was expected to index and describe it in his personal code book. By consulting his code book, the user could retrace annotated and generated entries.

Between 1990 and 1994, [[Paul Flaherty]], a Stanford student who was looking for a project, was introduced by his wife to her supervisor.  The supervisor had just seen a demonstration of the World Wide Web and suggested it could be improved and better conformed to the memex described by Vannevar Bush if links did not have to be manually inserted and instead one could follow a link simply by using the words themselves.  Flaherty went on to create [[AltaVista]], the first searchable, full-text database of a large part of the Web.

By 1999, many companies had created [[Web annotation|web annotation systems]], where web site publishers or users could annotate web pages. Sentius Corporation, for one, developed technology that would automatically insert hyperlinks into web or text documents, from a dictionary of terms. This was used in particular to display Japanese translations of English medical terms when the mouse hovered over a term, while maintaining the look of a standard text document normally, and then extended for other purposes.
 
== Legacy ==
This idea directly influenced computer pioneers [[J.C.R. Licklider]] (see his 1960 paper ''[[Man-Computer Symbiosis]]''), [[Douglas Engelbart]] (see his 1962 report ''[[Augmenting Human Intellect]]''), and also led to [[Ted Nelson]]'s groundbreaking work in concepts of [[hypermedia]] and [[hypertext]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Engines of Creation]] | year = 1986 | first = K Eric | last = Drexler | author-link = K. Eric Drexler}}{{Page needed |date=November 2011}}{{verify source| date= November 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=November 2011}}{{verify source|date=November 2011}}

''As We May Think'' also predicted many kinds of technology invented after its publication in addition to [[hypertext]] such as [[personal computers]], the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[speech recognition]], and [[CD-ROM encyclopedia]]s such as [[Encarta]] and [[online encyclopedia]]s such as [[Wikipedia]]: "Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified."{{Sfn | Bush | 1945 | loc=Section 8}}

Bush's influence is still evident in research laboratories of today in [[Gordon Bell]]'s [[MyLifeBits]] (from [[Microsoft Research]]), which implements [[Path (graph theory)|path]]-based systems reminiscent of the Memex, is especially impactful in the areas of [[information retrieval]] and [[information science]].&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, B. J. and Rieh, S. (2010) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/jansen_theoretical_constructs.pdf The Seventeen Theoretical Constructs of Information Searching and Information Retrieval]. Journal of the American Society for Information Sciences and Technology. 61(8), 1517-1534.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fictional implementation of the memex appears in [[The Laundry Files]] series by [[Charles Stross]].

A high-performance computing cluster (HPC) at the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]] is named "Memex".

=== DARPA's Memex program ===
In early 2014, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) released a statement on their website outlining the preliminary details of the "Memex program", which aims at developing new search technologies overcoming some limitations of text-based search.&lt;ref name="DARPA PR 20140209"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Memex Aims to Create a New Paradigm for Domain-Specific Search |url=http://www.darpa.mil/newsevents/releases/2014/02/09.aspx |publisher=[[DARPA]] |date=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DARPA wants the Memex technology developed in this research to be usable for search engines that can search for information on the [[Deep Web (search indexing)|Deep Web]] – the part of the Internet that is largely unreachable by commercial search engines like [[Google]] or [[Yahoo]]. DARPA's website describes that "The goal is to invent better methods for interacting with and sharing information, so users can quickly and thoroughly organize and search subsets of information relevant to their individual interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/program/memex|title=Memex (Domain-Specific Search)|website=www.darpa.mil|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As reported in a 2015 ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' article, the search technology being developed in the Memex program "aims to shine a light on the [[dark web]] and uncover patterns and relationships in online data to help law enforcement and others track illegal activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Darpa Is Developing a Search Engine for the Dark Web |author=Kim Zetter |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=February 2, 2015 |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/darpa-memex-dark-web/}}&lt;/ref&gt; DARPA intends for the program to replace the centralized procedures used by commercial search engines, stating that the "creation of a new domain-specific indexing and search paradigm will provide mechanisms for improved content discovery, information extraction, information retrieval, user collaboration, and extension of current search capabilities to the deep web, the dark web, and nontraditional (e.g. multimedia) content".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In their description of the program, DARPA explains the program's name as a tribute to Bush's original Memex invention, which served as an inspiration.&lt;ref name="DARPA PR 20140209" /&gt;

In April 2015, it was announced parts of Memex would be open sourced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/04/17/darpa-nasa-and-partners-show-off-memex/ |title=Watch Out Google, DARPA Just Open Sourced All This Swish 'Dark Web' Search Tech |work= |author=Forbes |date=April 17, 2015 |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modules were available for download.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opencatalog.darpa.mil/MEMEX.html |title=Memex (Domain-Specific Search) |publisher=DARPA |author= |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memex revisited ==
In 1967, Vannevar Bush published a retrospective article entitled "Memex Revisited"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bush, Vannevar. "Memex Revisited," ''Science Is Not Enough'' (New York: William Morrow &amp; Co., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''Science Is Not Enough''. Published 22 years after his initial conception of the Memex, Bush details the various technological advancements that have made his vision a possibility. Specifically, Bush cites photocells, transistors, cathode ray tubes, magnetic and video tape, "high-speed electric circuits", and "miniaturization of solid-state devices" such as the TV and radio. The article claims that [[magnetic tape]] would be central to the creation of a modern Memex device. The erasable quality of the tape is of special significance, as this would allow for modification of information stored in the proposed Memex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the article, Bush stresses the continued importance of supplementing "how creative men think" and relates that the systems for indexing data are still insufficient and rely too much on linear pathways rather than the association-based system of the human brain. Bush writes that a machine with the "speed and flexibility" of the brain is not attainable, but improvements could be made in regard to the capacity to obtain informational "permanence and clarity".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bush also relates that, unlike digital technology, Memex would be of no significant aid to business or profitable ventures, and as a consequence its development would occur only long after the mechanization of libraries and the introduction of what he describes as the specialized "group machine", which would be useful for the sharing of ideas in fields such as medicine. Furthermore, although Bush discusses the compressional ability and rapidity so key to modern machines, he relates that speed will not be an integral part of Memex, stating that a tenth of a second would be an acceptable interval for its data retrieval, rather than the billionths of a second that modern computers are capable of. "For Memex," he writes, "the problem is not swift access, but selective access". Bush states that although the code-reading and potential linking capabilities of the rapid selector would be key to the creation of Memex, there is still an issue of enabling "moderately rapid access to really large memory storage". There is an issue concerning selection, Bush conveys, and despite the fact that improvements have been made in the speed of digital selection, according to Bush, "selection, in the broad sense, is still a stone adze in the hands of the cabinetmaker". Bush goes on to discuss the record-making process and how Memex could incorporate systems of voice-control and user-propagated learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He proposes a machine that could respond to "simple remarks" as well as build trails&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; based on its user's "habits of association," as Belinda Barnet described them in "The Technical Evolution of Vannevar Bush's Memex." Barnet also makes the distinction between the idea of a constructive Memex and the "permanent trails" described in ''As We May Think,'' and attributes Bush's machine learning concepts to Claude Shannon's mechanical mouse and work with "feedback and [[machine learning]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnet|first=Belinda|date=2008-01-01|title=The Technical Evolution of Vannevar Bush's Memex|url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/2/1/000015/000015.html|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">'''Memo motion''' or '''spaced-shot photography''' is a tool of [[time and motion study]] that analyzes long operations by using a camera. It was developed 1946 by [[Marvin E. Mundel]] at [[Purdue University]], who was first to save film material while planning studies on kitchen work.

Mundel published the method in 1947 with several studies in his textbook ''Systematic Motion and time study''.&lt;ref&gt;Mundel, Marvin Everett: Systematic Motion and time study : improving productivity. Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice Hall, 1946. The book became a standard und was published by David Danner (ed.) as ''Motion and time study : improving productivity.'' in 7th ed. 1994 with {{ISBN|0-13-588369-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A study showed the following advantages of Memo-Motion in regard to other forms of time and motion study:&lt;ref&gt;Norbury, Clifford J.: The Application of Memo-Motion to Industrial Operations. Cranfield : College of Aeronautics, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Single operator repetition work ...
#Aerea studies, the study of a group of men or machines.
#Team studies.
#Utilisation studies.
#Work measurement.

As a versatile tool of work study it was used in the US to some extent, but rarely in Europe and other industrial countries mainly because of difficulties procuring the required cameras. Today Memo-Motion could have a comeback because more and more workplaces have conditions which it can explore.

'''Micro combined heat and power''' or '''micro-CHP''' or '''mCHP''' is an extension of the idea of [[cogeneration]] to the single/multi family home or small office building in the range of up to 50 [[Kilowatt|kW]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32004L0008|title=EUR-Lex - 32004L0008 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local generation has the potential for a higher efficiency than traditional grid-level generators since it lacks the 8-10% energy losses from transporting [[electricity]] over long distances. It also lacks the 10–15% energy losses from [[heat transfer]] in district heating networks due to the difference between the thermal energy carrier (hot water) and the colder external environment. The most common systems use natural gas as their primary energy source and emit [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]].

== Overview ==
Combined heat and power (CHP) systems for homes or small commercial buildings are often fueled by [[natural gas]] to produce electricity and heat.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angrisani|first=G.|last2=Roselli|first2=C.|last3=Sasso|first3=M.|date=2012-08-01|title=Distributed microtrigeneration systems|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360128512000068|journal=Progress in Energy and Combustion Science|volume=38|issue=4|pages=502–521|doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2012.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A micro-CHP system usually contains a small [[fuel cell]] or a [[heat engine]] as a prime mover used to rotate a generator which provides [[electric power]], while simultaneously utilizing the waste heat from the prime mover for an individual building's [[HVAC|heating, ventilation, and air conditioning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540255826|title=Micro Cogeneration - Towards Decentralized Energy Systems {{!}} Martin Pehnt {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A micro-CHP generator may primarily follow heat demand, delivering [[electricity]] as the by-product, or may follow electrical demand to [[electricity generation|generate electricity]] and use heat as the by-product. When used primarily for heating, micro-CHP systems may generate more electricity than is instantaneously being demanded in circumstances of fluctuating electrical demand.

The heat engine version is a small scale example of [[cogeneration]] schemes which have been used with large electric power plants. The purpose of cogeneration is to utilize more of the energy in the fuel. The reason for using such systems is that [[heat engines]], such as [[steam power plant]]s which generate the electric power needed for modern life by burning fuel, are not very efficient. Due to [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]], a heat engine cannot be 100% efficient;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869741544|title=Thermodynamics : an engineering approach|last=A.,|first=Çengel, Yunus|others=Boles, Michael A.,|isbn=0073398179|edition=Eighth|location=New York|oclc=869741544}}&lt;/ref&gt; it cannot convert anywhere near all the heat produced from the fuel it burns into organized forms of energy such as electricity. Therefore, heat engines always produce a surplus of low-temperature [[waste heat]], called "secondary heat" or "low-grade heat". Modern plants are limited to efficiencies of about 33–63% at most, so 37–67% of the energy is exhausted as waste heat. In the past this energy was usually wasted to the environment. [[Cogeneration]] systems, built in recent years in cold-climate countries, utilize the waste heat produced by large power plants for heating by piping hot water from the plant into buildings in the surrounding community.

However, it is not practical to transport heat long distances due to heat loss from the pipes. Since electricity can be transported practically, it is more efficient to generate the electricity near where the waste heat can be used. So in a "micro-combined heat and power system" (micro-CHP), small power plants are instead located where the secondary heat can be used, in individual buildings. Micro-CHP is defined by the EC as being of less than 50&amp;nbsp;kW electrical power output,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; however, others have more restrictive definitions, all the way down to &lt;5 kWe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Paepe|first=Michel|last2=D’Herdt|first2=Peter|last3=Mertens|first3=David|date=2006-11-01|title=Micro-CHP systems for residential applications|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890406000124|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|volume=47|issue=18|pages=3435–3446|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2005.12.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In centralized power plants, the supply of "waste heat" may exceed the local heat demand. In such cases, if it is not desirable to reduce the power production, the excess waste heat must be disposed of (e.g. [[cooling tower]]s or [[sea cooling]]) without being used. A way to avoid excess waste heat is to reduce the fuel input to the CHP plant, reducing both the heat and power output to balance the heat demand. In doing this, the power production is limited by the heat demand.

In a traditional [[power plant]] delivering electricity to consumers, about 34.4% of the heat content of the primary heat energy source, such as [[biomass]], [[coal]], [[solar thermal]], [[natural gas]], [[petroleum]] or [[nuclear power|uranium]], reaches the consumer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/|title=State Electricity Profiles - Energy Information Administration|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the efficiency can be 20% for very old plants and 45% for newer gas plants. In contrast, a CHP system converts 15%–42% of the primary heat to electricity, and most of the remaining heat is captured for [[water heating|hot water]] or [[space heating]].

CHP systems are able to increase the total energy utilization of primary energy sources, such as fuel and concentrated [[solar thermal]] energy. Thus CHP has been steadily gaining popularity in all sectors of the energy economy, due to the increased costs of electricity and fuel, particularly fossil fuels, and due to environmental concerns, particularly [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Notter|first1=Dominic A.|last2=Kouravelou|first2=Katerina|last3=Karachalios|first3=Theodoros|last4=Daletou|first4=Maria K.|last5=Haberland|first5=Nara Tudela|title=Life cycle assessment of PEM FC applications: electric mobility and μ-CHP|journal=Energy Environ. Sci.|date=2015|volume=8|issue=7|pages=1969–1985|doi=10.1039/C5EE01082A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHP systems have benefited the industrial sector since the beginning of the industrial revolution. For three decades, these larger CHP systems were more economically justifiable than micro-CHP, due to the [[economy of scale]]. After the year 2000, micro-CHP has become cost effective in many markets around the world, due to rising energy costs. The development of micro-CHP systems has also been facilitated by recent technological developments of small heat engines. This includes improved performance and cost-effectiveness of [[fuel cell]]s, [[Stirling engine]]s, [[steam engines]], [[gas turbines]], [[diesel engine]]s and [[Otto engine]]s.

[[PEMFC]] fuel cell mCHP operates at low temperature  (50 to 100&amp;nbsp;°C) and needs high purity hydrogen, its prone to contamination, changes are made to operate at higher temperatures and improvements on the fuel reformer. [[SOFC]] fuel cell mCHP operates at a high temperature (500 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C) and can handle different energy sources well but the high temperature requires expensive materials to handle the temperature, changes are made to operate at a lower temperature. Because of the higher temperature SOFC in general has a longer start-up time and need continuous heat output even in times when there is no thermal demand.

CHP systems linked to [[absorption chiller]]s can use waste heat for [[refrigeration]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/tri-generation_fountainvalley.pdf Tri-Generation success story] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074647/https://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/tri-generation_fountainvalley.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 UK report from Ecuity Consulting stated that MCHP is the most cost-effective method of utilizing gas to generate energy at the domestic level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecuity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-role-of-micro-CHP-in-a-smart-energy-world.pdf The role of micro CHP in a smart energy world] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072549/http://www.ecuity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-role-of-micro-CHP-in-a-smart-energy-world.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/31489/micro-chp-report-powers-heated-discussion-about-uk-energy-future/ Micro CHP report powers heated discussion about UK energy future] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320101136/http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/31489/micro-chp-report-powers-heated-discussion-about-uk-energy-future/ |date=March 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuels===
There are many types of fuels and sources of heat that may be considered for micro-CHP. The properties of these sources vary in terms of system cost, heat cost, environmental effects, convenience, ease of transportation and storage, system maintenance, and system life. Some of the heat sources and fuels that are being considered for use with micro-CHP include: [[natural gas]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[biomass]], vegetable oil (such as [[rapeseed]] oil), [[woodgas]], [[solar power|solar thermal]],  and lately also [[hydrogen]], as well as multi-fuel systems. The energy sources with the lowest emissions of particulates and net-carbon dioxide include solar power, hydrogen, biomass (with two-stage gasification into [[biogas]]), and natural gas. Due to the high efficiency of the CHP process, cogeneration has still lower carbon emissions compared to energy transformation in fossil driven boilers or thermal power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dorer|first=Viktor|last2=Weber|first2=Andreas|date=2009-03-01|title=Energy and carbon emission footprint of micro-CHP systems in residential buildings of different energy demand levels|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19401490802596435|journal=Journal of Building Performance Simulation|volume=2|issue=1|pages=31–46|doi=10.1080/19401490802596435|issn=1940-1493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dorer|first=Viktor|last2=Weber|first2=Andreas|date=2009-03-01|title=Energy and CO2 emissions performance assessment of residential micro-cogeneration systems with dynamic whole-building simulation programs|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890408004123|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|volume=50|issue=3|pages=648–657|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2008.10.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of cogeneration systems use natural gas for fuel, because natural gas burns easily and cleanly, it can be inexpensive, it is available in most areas and is easily transported through pipelines which already exist for over 60 million homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_cons_num_dcu_nus_a.htm|title=U.S. Number of Natural Gas Consumers|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engine types===
[[Internal combustion engine|Reciprocating internal combustion engines]] are the most popular type of engine used in micro-CHP systems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Reciprocating internal combustion engine based systems can be sized such that the engine operates at a single fixed speed, usually resulting in a higher electrical or total efficiency. However, since [[Internal combustion engine|reciprocating internal combustion engines]] have the ability to modulate their power output by changing their operating speed and fuel input, micro-CHP systems based on these engines can have varying electrical and thermal output designed to meet changing demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marathonengine.com/cogeneration.html|title=ecopower® Cogeneration by Marathon Engine Systems|website=www.marathonengine.com|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural gas is suitable for [[internal combustion engine]]s, such as [[Otto engine]] and [[gas turbine]] systems. Gas turbines are used in many small systems due to their high efficiency, small size, clean combustion, durability and low maintenance requirements. Gas turbines designed with [[foil bearing]]s and air-cooling operate without lubricating oil or coolants. The waste heat of gas turbines is mostly in the exhaust, whereas the waste heat of [[reciprocating engine|reciprocating internal combustion engine]]s is split between the exhaust and cooling system.

[[External combustion engines]] can run on any high-temperature heat source. These engines include the [[Stirling engine]], hot "gas" turbocharger, and the [[steam engine]]. Both range from 10%-20% efficiency, and as of 2014, small quantities are in production for micro-CHP products.

Other possibilities include the [[Organic Rankine cycle]], which operates at lower temperatures and pressures using low-grade heat sources. The primary advantage to this is that the equipment is essentially an air-conditioning or refrigeration unit operating as an engine, whereby the piping and other components need not be designed for extreme temperatures and pressures, reducing cost and complexity. Electrical efficiency suffers, but it is presumed that such a system would be utilizing waste heat or a heat source such as a wood stove or gas boiler that would exist anyway for purposes of space heating.

The future of combined heat and power, particularly for homes and small businesses, will continue to be affected by the price of fuel, including natural gas. As fuel prices continue to climb, this will make the economics more favorable for energy conservation measures, and more [[efficient energy use]], including CHP and micro-CHP.

===Fuel cells===
Fuel cells generate electricity and heat as a by product. The advantages for a [[stationary fuel cell applications|stationary fuel cell application]] over stirling CHP are no moving parts, less maintenance, and quieter operation. The surplus electricity can be delivered back to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbit.dtu.dk/files/10492422/FCCHP_LV.pdf Integration of fuel cell micro-CHPs on low voltage grid: A Danish case study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072420/http://www.orbit.dtu.dk/files/10492422/FCCHP_LV.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PEMFC fuel cells fueled by natural gas or propane use a [[Steam reforming#Reforming for fuel cells|steam reformer]] to convert methane in the gas supply into [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] and hydrogen; the hydrogen then reacts with oxygen in the fuel cell to produce electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osakagas.co.jp/en/rd/fuelcell/pefc/reformed/enefarm.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116114226/http://www.osakagas.co.jp/en/rd/fuelcell/pefc/reformed/enefarm.html |archivedate=2016-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[PEMFC]] [[fuel cell]] based micro-CHP has an electrical efficiency of 37% [[Lower heating value|LHV]] and 33% [[Higher heating value|HHV]] and a [[heat recovery]] efficiency of 52% LHV and 47%  HHV with a [[service life]] of 40,000 hours or 4000 start/stop cycles which is equal to 10 year use. An estimated 138,000 Fuel cell CHP systems below 1&amp;nbsp;kW had been installed in Japan by the end of 2014.&lt;ref name="CHP Review 2015"/&gt; Most of these CHP systems are PEMFC based (85%) and the remaining are SOFC systems.

In 2013 [[Service life|Lifetime]] is around 60,000 hours. For PEM fuel cell units, which shut down at night, this equates to an estimated lifetime of between ten and fifteen years.&lt;ref name="fuelcelltoday.com"&gt;[http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/analysis/analyst-views/2013/13-02-27-latest-developments-in-the-ene-farm-scheme Latest developments in the Ene-Farm scheme] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414152815/http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/analysis/analyst-views/2013/13-02-27-latest-developments-in-the-ene-farm-scheme |date=April 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermoelectrics===

[[Thermoelectric]] generators operating on the [[Seebeck Effect]] show promise due to their total absence of moving parts. Efficiency, however, is the major concern as most thermoelectric devices fail to achieve 5% efficiency even with high temperature differences.

=== Solar micro-CHP===

====CPVT====
This can be achieved by [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector]], another option is '''Concentrated photovoltaics and thermal''' ('''CPVT'''), also sometimes called '''combined heat and power solar''' ('''CHAPS'''), is a [[cogeneration]] technology used in concentrated photovoltaics that produce both electricity and heat in the same module. The heat may be employed in [[district heating]], [[water heating]] and [[solar cooling|air conditioning]], [[desalination]] or [[process heat]].

CPVT systems are currently in production in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2008/11/researchers-explore-hybrid-concentrated-solar-energy-system-53981 Renewable Energy World-Researchers explore hybrid concentrated solar energy system] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220090012/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2008/11/researchers-explore-hybrid-concentrated-solar-energy-system-53981 |date=December 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Zenith Solar]] developing CPVT systems with a claimed efficiency of 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zenithsolar.com/content.aspx?id=290 |title=Zenith Solar Projects – Yavne |work=zenithsolar.com |year=2011 |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415024732/http://www.zenithsolar.com/content.aspx?id=290 |archivedate=April 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sopogy]] produces a micro [[concentrated solar power]] (microCSP) system based on [[parabolic trough]] which can be installed above building or homes, the heat can be used for water heating or [[solar air conditioning]], a [[steam turbine]] can also be installed to produce electricity.

====CHP+PV====
The recent development of small scale CHP systems has provided the opportunity for in-house power backup of residential-scale [[photovoltaic]] (PV) arrays.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1947"&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. M. Pearce|title=Expanding Photovoltaic Penetration with Residential Distributed Generation from Hybrid Solar Photovoltaic + Combined Heat and Power Systems|journal=Energy|volume=34|pp=1947–1954 (2009|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2009.08.012|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1974/5307}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of a recent study show that a PV+CHP hybrid system not only has the potential to radically reduce energy waste in the status quo electrical and heating systems, but it also enables the share of solar PV to be expanded by about a factor of five.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1947"/&gt; In some regions, in order to reduce waste from excess heat, an [[absorption chiller]] has been proposed to utilize the CHP-produced thermal energy for cooling of PV-CHP system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Nosrat|author2=J. M. Pearce|title=Dispatch Strategy and Model for Hybrid Photovoltaic and Combined Heating, Cooling, and Power Systems|journal=Applied Energy|volume=88|issue=9|year=2011|pages=3270–3276|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.02.044|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1974/6439}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Trigeneration|trigen]]+PV systems have the potential to save even more energy.

== Net metering ==
To date, micro-CHP systems achieve much of their savings, and thus attractiveness to consumers, by the value of electrical energy which is replaced by the autoproduced electricity. A "generate-and-resell" or [[net metering]] model supports this as home-generated power exceeding the instantaneous in-home needs is sold back to the electrical utility. This system is efficient because the energy used is distributed and used instantaneously over the [[electrical grid]]. The main losses are in the transmission from the source to the consumer which will typically be less than losses incurred by storing energy locally or generating power at less than the peak efficiency of the micro-CHP system. So, from a purely technical standpoint [[Dynamic demand (electric power)|dynamic demand management]] and net-metering are very efficient.

Another positive to net-metering is the fact that it is fairly easy to configure. The user's [[electrical meter]] is simply able to record electrical power exiting as well as entering the home or business. As such, it records the net amount of power entering the home. For a grid with relatively few micro-CHP users, no design changes to the electrical grid need be made. Additionally, in the [[United States]], federal and now many state regulations require utility operators to compensate anyone adding power to the grid. From the standpoint of grid operator, these points present operational and technical as well as administrative burdens. As a consequence, most grid operators compensate non-[[utility]] power-contributors at less than or equal to the rate they charge their customers. While this compensation scheme may seem almost fair at first glance, it only represents the consumer’s cost-savings of not purchasing utility power versus the true cost of generation and operation to the micro-CHP operator. Thus from the standpoint of micro-CHP operators, net-metering is not ideal.

While net-metering is a very efficient mechanism for using excess energy generated by a micro-CHP system, it does have detractors. Of the detractors' main points, the first to consider is that while the main generating source on the electrical grid is a large commercial generator, net-metering generators "spill" power to the [[smart grid]] in a haphazard and unpredictable fashion. However, the effect is negligible if there are only a small percentage of customers generating electricity and each of them generates a relatively small amount of electricity. When turning on an oven or space heater, about the same amount of electricity is drawn from the grid as a home generator puts out. If the percentage of homes with generating systems becomes large, then the effect on the grid may become significant. Coordination among the generating systems in homes and the rest of the grid may be necessary for reliable operation and to prevent damage to the grid.

===UK===
It is estimated that about 1,000 micro-CHP systems were in operation in the UK as of 2002. These are primarily [[Applications of the Stirling engine#MicroCHP|Whispergen]] using [[Stirling engine]]s, and Senertec Dachs [[reciprocating engine]]s. The market is supported by the government through regulatory work, and some government research money expended through the Energy Saving Trust and [[The Carbon Trust|Carbon Trust]], which are public bodies supporting energy efficiency in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chpa.co.uk/events/2006/national_conference/presentations/1400%20Ian%20Stares.pdf CHP–The microgeneration boom?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106122855/http://www.chpa.co.uk/events/2006/national_conference/presentations/1400%20Ian%20Stares.pdf |date=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective as of 7 April 2005, the UK government has cut the VAT from 20% to 5% for micro-CHP systems, in order to support demand for this emerging technology at the expense of existing, less environmentally friendly technology. The reduction in VAT is effectively a 10.63%&lt;ref&gt;Not 12.5% as could be primarily thought: a subsidized system cost 105/117.5% of a normal, the différence being 12.5/117.5&amp;nbsp;= 10.63%&lt;/ref&gt; [[subsidy]] for micro-CHP units over conventional systems, which will help micro-CHP units become more cost competitive, and ultimately drive micro-CHP sales in the UK. Of the 24 million households in the UK, as many as 14 to 18 million are thought to be suitable for micro-CHP units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecuity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-role-of-micro-CHP-in-a-smart-energy-world.pdf The role of micro CHP in a smart energy world = March 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072549/http://www.ecuity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-role-of-micro-CHP-in-a-smart-energy-world.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two fuel cell varieties of mCHP co-generation units are almost ready for mainstream production and are planned for release to commercial markets in early in 2014. With the UK Government's Feed-In-Tariff available for a 10-year period, a wide uptake of the technology is anticipated.

Oregon State University, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Research Project Agency - Energy (ARPA-e), tested the state of the art micro-CHP systems in the United States. The results showed that the nominally 1 kWe state-of-the-art micro-CHP system operated at an electrical and total efficiency (LHV based) of 23.4 and 74.4%, respectively. The nominally 5 kWe state-of-the-art system operated at an electrical and total efficiency (LHV based) of 24.4 and 94.5%, respectively. The most popular 7 kWe home backup generator (not CHP) operated at an electrical efficiency (LHV based) of 21.5%. The price of the emergency backup generator was an order of magnitude lower than the 5 kWe generator, but the projected life span of the system was over 2 orders of magnitude lower. These results show the trade-off between efficiency, cost, and durability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">[[Image:Bedandrind.jpg|350px|thumb|A bedstone and the rind]]
A '''millrind''' or simply '''rind''' is an iron support, usually four-armed or [[cross]]-shaped, for the [[runner stone|upper ("runner") stone]] in a pair of [[millstone]]s.

The rind is affixed to the top of the square-section main shaft or spindle and supports the entire weight of the runner stone, which can be as much as several tons. The face of a runner stone usually has a carved depression, called the "Spanish cross", to accommodate the millrind. The rind is necessary because the grain is fed through the runner stone's central hole, so the spindle cannot be inserted through it like a cartwheel on an axle. 
==Mechanism==
A later refinement, replacing the cross, was to mount a ''mace'' onto the spindle, which fitted into a [[gimbal]] let into the runner stone. The device allowed the runner stone to move in two planes and thus follow the nether (stationary) stone more closely, but great care had to be taken to ensure that its weight was properly balanced. The separation of the nether stone from the runner, controlling the fineness of the grind, was adjusted by the ''tenter'' mechanism: a [[Leadscrew|screw jack]] to raise or lower the bearing carrying the base of spindle.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=Geoff |title=Thorrington Tide Mill |date=2003 |publisher=Essex County Council |isbn=185281-232-X |pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In heraldry==
The millrind occasionally appears as a [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[heraldry]], in which it is often known by the French name ''fer-de-moline'' ("iron of a mill"). Like real millrinds, the fer-de-moline is highly variable in form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry|last=Fox-Davies|first=Charles|date=1909|publisher=T.C. and E.C. Jack|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41617/41617-h/41617-h.htm|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th century writer [[John Bossewell|Bossewell]] characterized it as a symbol fit for judges and magistrates, who keep men on a straight course just as a millrind does with a runner stone.&lt;ref name=an&gt;{{cite web|title=A System of Heraldry|last=Nisbet|first=Alexander|date=1816|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is more often found as a [[canting arms|rebus]] in the arms of families with names like Miller or Milne.&lt;ref name=an/&gt; 

Another charge based on the millrind is the [[cross moline]], which takes the form of a cross with bifurcated ends (sometimes with a pierced centre and sometimes without). In early [[blazonry|blazons]] the term ''fer-de-moline'' often refers to the cross moline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Glossary of Terms Used in Heraldry|last=Parker|first=James|date=1894|publisher=Heraldsnet|url=https://www.heraldsnet.org/saitou/parker/Jpglossc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27217">'''Hybrid nuclear fusion–fission''' ('''hybrid nuclear power''') is a proposed means of generating [[Electrical power industry|power]] by use of a combination of [[nuclear fusion]] and [[Nuclear fission|fission]] processes. The basic idea is to use high-energy [[fast neutron]]s from a fusion reactor to trigger fission in otherwise nonfissile fuels like [[Uranium-238|U-238]] or [[Thorium-232|Th-232]]. Each neutron can trigger several fission events, multiplying the energy released by each fusion reaction hundreds of times. This would not only make fusion designs more economical in power terms, but also be able to burn fuels that were not suitable for use in conventional fission plants, even their [[nuclear waste]].  

The concept dates to the 1950s, and was strongly advocated by [[Hans Bethe]] during the 1970s. At that time the first powerful fusion experiments were being built, but it would still be many years before they could be economically competitive. Hybrids were proposed as a way of greatly accelerating their market introduction, producing energy even before the fusion systems reached [[Fusion energy gain factor|break-even]]. However, detailed studies of the economics of the systems suggested they could not compete with existing fission reactors.

The idea was abandoned and lay dormant until the 2000s, when the continued delays in reaching break-even led to a brief revival around 2009,&lt;ref name="hybrid"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gerstner, E. | title = Nuclear energy: The hybrid returns | year = 2009 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 460 | issue = 7251| pages = 25–8 | pmid = 19571861|doi=10.1038/460025a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090701/pdf/460025a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably as the basis of the [[LIFE (fusion)|LIFE]] program. This program was cancelled when the underlying technology, from the [[National Ignition Facility]], failed to reach its design performance goals. Apollo Fusion, a company founded by Google executive [[Mike Cassidy (entrepreneur)|Mike Cassidy]] in 2017, was also reported to be focused on using the subcritical nuclear fusion-fission hybrid method. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a25922/apollo-fusion-startup-googler-nuclear-power/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-03/former-google-vice-president-starts-a-company-promising-clean-and-safe-nuclear-energy&lt;/ref&gt;

In general terms, the hybrid is similar in concept to the [[fast breeder reactor]], which uses a compact high-energy fission core in place of the hybrid's fusion core. Another similar concept is the [[accelerator-driven subcritical reactor]], which uses a [[particle accelerator]] to provide the neutrons instead of nuclear reactions.
 
==Fission basics==
Conventional fission power plants rely on the chain reaction caused when [[nuclear fission]] events release neutrons that cause further fission events. Each fission event in [[uranium]] releases two or three neutrons, so by careful arrangement and the use of various absorber materials, you can balance the system so one of those neutrons causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This careful balance is known as [[critical mass|criticality]].

[[Natural uranium]] is a mix of several isotopes, mainly a trace amount of [[Uranium-235|U-235]] and over 99% [[Uranium-238|U-238]]. When they undergo fission, both of these elements release fast neutrons with an energy distribution peaking around 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;MeV. This energy is too low to cause fission in U-238, which means it cannot sustain a chain reaction. U-235 will undergo fission when struck by neutrons of this energy, so it is possible for U-235 to sustain a chain reaction, as is the case in a [[nuclear bomb]]. However, the probability of one neutron causing fission in another U-235 atom before it escapes the fuel is too low to maintain criticality in a mass of natural uranium, so the chain reaction can only occur in fuels with increased amounts of U-235. This is accomplished by concentrating, or ''enriching'', the fuel, increasing the amount of U-235 to produce [[enriched uranium]],{{sfn|Brennen|2005|p=16}} while the leftover, now mostly U-238, is a waste product known as [[depleted uranium]].{{sfn|Brennen|2005|p=19}}

U-235 will undergo fission more easily if the neutrons are of lower energy, the so-called ''[[thermal neutron]]s''. Neutrons can be slowed to thermal energies through collisions with a [[neutron moderator]] material, the easiest to use being the hydrogen atoms found in water. By placing the fission fuel in water, the probability that the neutrons will cause fission in another U-235 is greatly increased, which means the level of enrichment needed to reach criticality is greatly reduced. This leads to the concept of ''reactor-grade'' enriched uranium, with the amount of U-235 increased from just less than 1% to between 3 and 5% depending on the reactor design. This is in contrast to'' [[weapons-grade]]'' enrichment, which increases to the U-235 to at least 20%, and more commonly, over 90%.{{sfn|Brennen|2005|p=19}}

In order to maintain criticality, the fuel has to retain that extra concentration of U-235. However, a typical fission reactor burns off enough of the U-235 to cause the reaction to stop over a period on the order of a few months. A combination of burnup of the U-235 along with the creation of neutron absorbers, or ''poisons'', as part of the fission process eventually results in the fuel mass not being able to maintain criticality. This burned up fuel has to be removed and replaced with fresh fuel. The result is [[nuclear waste]] that is highly radioactive and filled with long lived radionuclides that present a safety concern.

The waste contains most of the U-235 it started with, only 1% or so of the energy in the fuel is extracted by the time it reaches the point where it is no longer fissile. One solution to this problem is to [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocess]] the fuel, which uses chemical processes to separate the U-235 (and other non-poison elements) from the waste, and then uses that U-235 in fresh fuel loads. This reduces the amount of new fuel that needs to be mined, and also concentrates the unwanted portions of the waste into a smaller load. Reprocessing is expensive, however, and has generally been more expensive than simply buying fresh fuel from the mine.

Another possibility is to ''[[Breeder reactor|breed]]'' Pu-239 from the U-238 through [[neutron capture]], or various other means. In order to do this, higher energy neutrons are required, which means they cannot be moderated as in a conventional reactor. The simplest way to achieve this is to further enrich the original fuel well beyond what is needed for use in a moderated reactor, to the point where the U-235 maintains criticality even with the fast neutrons. The extra fast neutrons escaping the fuel load can then be used to breed fuel in a U-238 assembly surrounding the reactor core, most commonly taken from the stocks of depleted uranium. The Pu-239 is then chemically separated and mixed into fresh fuel for conventional reactors, in the same fashion as normal reprocessing, but the total volume of fuel created in this process is much greater. In spite of this, like reprocessing, the economics of breeder reactors has proven unattractive, and commercial breeder plants have ceased operation.

==Fusion basics==
Fusion reactors typically burn a mixture of [[deuterium]] (D) and [[tritium]] (T). When heated to millions of degrees, the [[kinetic energy]] in the fuel begins to overcome the natural electrostatic repulsion between nuclei, the so-called [[coulomb barrier]], and the fuel begins to undergo fusion. This reaction gives off an [[alpha particle]] and a high energy [[neutron]] of 14&amp;nbsp;MeV. A key requirement to the economic operation of a fusion reactor is that the alphas deposit their energy back into the fuel mix, heating it so that additional fusion reactions take place. This leads to a condition not unlike the chain reaction in the fission case, known as ''ignition''.

Deuterium can be obtained by the separation of hydrogen isotopes in sea water (see [[heavy water#production|heavy water production]]). Tritium has a short half life of just over a decade, so only trace amounts are found in nature. To fuel the reactor, the neutrons from the reaction are used to breed more tritium through a reaction in a ''blanket'' of [[lithium]] surrounding the reaction chamber. Tritium breeding is key to the success of a D-T fusion cycle, and to date this technique has not been demonstrated. Predictions based on computer modeling suggests that the breeding ratios are quite small and a fusion plant would barely be able to cover its own use. Many years would be needed to breed enough surplus to start another reactor.

==Hybrid concepts==
Fusion–fission designs essentially replace the lithium blanket with a blanket of fission fuel, either natural uranium ore or even nuclear waste. The fusion neutrons have more than enough energy to cause fission in the U-238, as well as many of the other elements in the fuel, including some of the [[transuranic]] waste elements. The reaction can continue even when all of the U-235 is burned off; the rate is controlled not by the neutrons from the fission events, but the neutrons being supplied by the fusion reactor.

Fission occurs naturally because each event gives off more than one neutron capable of producing additional fission events. Fusion, at least in D-T fuel, gives off only a single neutron, and that neutron is not capable of producing more fusion events. When that neutron strikes fissile material in the blanket, one of two reactions may occur. In many cases, the kinetic energy of the neutron will cause one or two neutrons to be struck out of the nucleus without causing fission. These neutrons still have enough energy to cause other fission events. In other cases the neutron will be captured and cause fission, which will release two or three neutrons. This means that every fusion neutron in the fusion–fission design can result in anywhere between two and four neutrons in the fission fuel.{{sfn|Bethe|1979|p=48}}

This is a key concept in the hybrid concept, known as ''fission multiplication''. For every fusion event, several fission events may occur, each of which gives off much more energy than the original fusion, about 11 times. This greatly increases the total power output of the reactor. This has been suggested as a way to produce practical fusion reactors in spite of the fact that no fusion reactor has yet reached break-even, by multiplying the power output using cheap fuel or waste.{{sfn|Bethe|1979|p=48}} However, a number of studies have repeatedly demonstrated that this only becomes practical when the overall reactor is very large, 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;GWt, which makes it expensive to build.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=Tenney |first1=F. |last2=Bathke |first2=C. |display-authors=1 |title=A Systems Study of Tokamak Fusion–Fission Reactors |url=http://www.ralphmoir.com/media/tenneyMerged.pdf |date=November 1978 |publisher=Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory |pages=336-337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These processes also have the side-effect of breeding Pu-239 or U-233, which can be removed and used as fuel in conventional fission reactors. This leads to an alternate design where the primary purpose of the fusion–fission reactor is to reprocess waste into new fuel. Although far less economical than chemical reprocessing, this process also burns off some of the nastier elements instead of simply physically separating them out. This also has advantages for [[nuclear non-proliferation|non-proliferation]], as enrichment and reprocessing technologies are also associated with nuclear weapons production. However, the cost of the nuclear fuel produced is very high, and is unlikely to be able to compete with conventional sources.

==Neutron economy==
A key issue for the fusion–fission concept is the number and lifetime of the neutrons in the various processes, the so-called ''[[neutron economy]]''.

In a pure fusion design, the neutrons are used for breeding tritium in a lithium blanket. Natural lithium consists of about 92% Li-7 and the rest is mostly Li-6. Li-7 requires neutron energies even higher than those released by fission, around 5&amp;nbsp;MeV, well within the range of energies provided by fusion. This reaction produces [[Tritium]] and [[Helium-4]], and another slow neutron. Li-6 can react with high or low energy neutrons, including those released by the Li-7 reaction. This means that a single fusion reaction can produce several tritiums, which is a requirement if the reactor is going to make up for natural decay and losses in the fusion processes.

When the lithium blanket is replaced, or supplanted, by fission fuel in the hybrid design, neutrons that do react with the fissile material are no longer available for tritium breeding. The new neutrons released from the fission reactions can be used for this purpose, but only in Li-6. One could process the lithium to increase the amount of Li-6 in the blanket, making up for these losses, but the downside to this process is that the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium atom. Only the high-energy reaction between the fusion neutron and Li-7 can create more than one tritium, and this is essential for keeping the reactor running.

To address this issue, at least some of the fission neutrons must also be used for tritium breeding in Li-6. Every one that does is no longer available for fission, reducing the reactor output. This requires a very careful balance if one wants the reactor to be able to produce enough tritium to keep itself running, while also producing enough fission events to keep the fission side energy positive. If these cannot be accomplished simultaneously, there is no reason to build a hybrid. Even if this balance can be maintained, it might only occur at a level that is economically infeasible.

==Overall economy==
Through the early development of the hybrid concept the question of overall economics appeared difficult to handle. A series of studies starting in the late 1970s provided a much clearer picture of the hybrid in a complete fuel cycle, and allowed the economics to be better understood. These studies appeared to indicate there was no reason to build a hybrid.

One of the most detailed of these studies was published in 1980 by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL).{{sfn|Barrett|Hardie|1980}} Their study noted that the hybrid would produce most of its energy indirectly, both through the fission events in its own reactor, and much more by providing Pu-239 to fuel conventional fission reactors. In this overall picture, the hybrid is essentially identical to the [[breeder reactor]], which uses fast neutrons from plutonium fission to breed more fuel in a fission blanket in largely the same fashion as the hybrid.{{sfn|Barrett|Hardie|1980|p=2}} Both require chemical processing to remove the bred Pu-239, both presented the same proliferation and safety risks as a result, and both produced about the same amount of fuel. Since that fuel is the primary source of energy in the overall cycle, the two systems were almost identical in the end.{{sfn|Barrett|Hardie|1980|p=3}}

What was not identical, however, was the technical maturity of the two designs. The hybrid would require considerable additional research and development before it would be known if it could even work, and even if that were demonstrated, the end result would be a system essentially identical to breeders which were already being built at that time. The report concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The investment of time and money required to commercialize the hybrid cycle could only be justified by a real or perceived advantage of the hybrid over the classical FBR. Our analysis leads us to conclude that no such advantage exists. Therefore, there is not sufficient incentive to demonstrate and commercialize the fusion–fission hybrid.{{sfn|Barrett|Hardie|1980|p=3}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Rationale==

The fusion process alone currently does not achieve sufficient gain (power output over power input) to be viable as a power source.  By using the excess neutrons from the fusion reaction to in turn cause a high-yield fission reaction (close to 100%) in the surrounding subcritical fissionable blanket, the net yield from the hybrid fusion–fission process can provide a targeted gain of 100 to 300 times the input energy (an increase by a factor of three or four over fusion alone).  Even allowing for high [[Energy conversion efficiency|inefficiencies]] on the input side (i.e. low laser efficiency in ICF and [[Nuclear fusion#Bremsstrahlung losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas|Bremsstrahlung losses]] in Tokamak designs), this can still yield sufficient heat output for economical electric power generation.  This can be seen as a shortcut to viable fusion power until more efficient pure fusion technologies can be developed, or as an end in itself to generate power, and also consume existing stockpiles of nuclear fissionables and waste products.

In the LIFE project at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [[LLNL]], using technology developed at the [[National Ignition Facility]], the goal is to use [[Inertial confinement fusion#ICF mechanism of action|fuel pellet]]s of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] surrounded by a fissionable blanket to produce energy sufficiently greater than the input ([[laser]]) energy for electrical power generation.  The principle involved is to induce [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) in the fuel pellet which acts as a highly concentrated point source of [[neutron]]s which in turn converts and fissions the outer fissionable blanket. In parallel with the ICF approach, the [[University of Texas]] at Austin is developing a system based on the [[tokamak]] fusion reactor, optimising for nuclear waste disposal versus power generation. The principles behind using either ICF or tokamak reactors as a neutron source are essentially the same (the primary difference being that ICF is essentially a point-source of neutrons while Tokamaks are more diffuse toroidal sources).

==Use to dispose of nuclear waste==

The surrounding blanket can be a [[fissile]] material (enriched uranium or [[plutonium]]) or a fertile material (capable of conversion to a fissionable material by neutron bombardment) such as [[thorium]], [[depleted uranium]] or [[spent nuclear fuel]].  Such [[subcritical reactor]]s (which also include [[particle accelerator]]-driven neutron [[spallation]] systems) offer the only currently-known  means of active disposal (versus storage) of spent nuclear fuel without reprocessing.  [[Activation product|Fission by-products]] produced by the operation of commercial light water nuclear reactors ([[LWR]]s) are long-lived and highly radioactive, but they can be consumed using the excess neutrons in the fusion reaction along with the fissionable components in the blanket, essentially destroying them by [[nuclear transmutation]] and producing a waste product which is far safer and less of a risk for [[nuclear proliferation]].  The waste would contain significantly reduced concentrations of long-lived, weapons-usable [[actinide]]s per gigawatt-year of electric energy produced compared to the waste from a LWR. In addition, there would be about 20 times less waste per unit of electricity produced.  This offers the potential to efficiently use the very large stockpiles of enriched fissile materials, depleted uranium, and spent nuclear fuel.

==Safety==

In contrast to current commercial fission reactors, hybrid reactors potentially demonstrate what is  considered [[inherently safe]] behavior because they remain deeply [[subcritical]] under all conditions and decay heat removal is possible via passive mechanisms.  The fission is driven by neutrons provided by fusion ignition events, and is consequently not self-sustaining.  If the fusion process is deliberately shut off or the process is disrupted by a mechanical failure, the fission [[damping|damps out]] and stops nearly instantly. This is in contrast to the forced damping in a conventional reactor by means of control rods which absorb neutrons to reduce the [[neutron flux]] below the critical, self-sustaining, level.  The inherent danger of a conventional fission reactor is any situation leading to a [[positive feedback]], runaway, [[chain reaction]] such as occurred during the [[Chernobyl disaster]].  In a hybrid configuration the fission and fusion reactions are decoupled, i.e. while the fusion neutron output drives the fission, the fission output has no effect whatsoever on the fusion reaction, completely eliminating any chance of a positive feedback loop.

==Fuel cycle==
There are three main components to the hybrid fusion fuel cycle: [[deuterium]], [[tritium]], and fissionable elements.{{sfn|Bethe|1979}}  Deuterium can be derived by separation of hydrogen isotopes in sea water (see [[heavy water]] production).  Tritium may be generated in the hybrid process itself by absorption of neutrons in lithium bearing compounds.  This would entail an additional lithium bearing blanket and a means of collection.  The third component is externally derived fissionable materials from demilitarized supplies of fissionables, or commercial nuclear fuel and waste streams.  Fusion driven fission also offers the possibility of using [[Thorium]] as a fuel, which would greatly increase the potential amount of fissionables available.  The extremely energetic nature of the [[fast neutrons]] emitted during the fusion events (up to 0.17 the speed of light) can allow normally non-fissioning U-238 to undergo fission directly (without conversion first to Pu-239), enabling refined natural Uranium to be used with very low enrichment, while still maintaining a deeply subcritical regime.

==Engineering considerations==
Practical engineering designs must first take into account safety as the primary goal.  All designs should incorporate passive cooling in combination with refractory materials to prevent melting and reconfiguration of fissionables into geometries capable of un-intentional criticality.  Blanket layers of Lithium bearing compounds will generally be included as part of the design to generate Tritium to allow the system to be self-supporting for one of the key fuel element components.  Tritium, because of its relatively short half-life and extremely high radioactivity, is best generated on site to obviate the necessity of transportation from a remote location.  D-T fuel can be manufactured on site using Deuterium derived from heavy water production and Tritium generated in the hybrid reactor itself.  [[Spallation#Nuclear spallation|Nuclear spallation]] to generate additional neutrons can be used to enhance the fission output, with the caveat that this is a tradeoff between the number of neutrons (typically 20-30 neutrons per spallation event) against a reduction of the individual energy of each neutron.  This is a consideration if the reactor is to use natural Thorium as a fuel.  While high energy (0.17c) neutrons produced from fusion events are capable of directly causing fission in both Thorium and U-238, the lower energy neutrons produced by spallation generally cannot.  This is a tradeoff which affects the mixture of fuels against the degree of spallation used in the design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5357">In [[nuclear power]] technology, '''online refuelling''' is a technique for changing the fuel of a [[nuclear reactor]] while the reactor is [[critical mass|critical]].  This allows the reactor to continue to generate electricity during routine refuelling, and therefore improve the [[availability]] and profitability of the plant.

== Benefits of online refuelling ==
Online refuelling allows a nuclear reactor to continue to generate electricity during periods of routine refuelling, and therefore improves the [[availability]] and therefore the economy of the plant.  Additionally, this allows for more flexibility in reactor refuelling schedules, exchanging a small number of fuel elements at a time rather than high-intensity offline refuelling programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/te_1315_web.pdf|title = Nuclear power plant outage optimisation strategy|date = |accessdate = 4 July 2015|website = |publisher = IAEA|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to refuel a reactor while generating power has the greatest benefits where refuelling is required at high frequency, for example during the production of [[plutonium]] suitable for [[nuclear weapon]]s during which low-[[burnup]] fuel is required from short irradiation periods in a reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Plutonium|url = http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Fuel-Recycling/Plutonium/|website = www.world-nuclear.org|accessdate = 2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, frequent rearrangement of fuel within the core can balance the thermal load and allow higher fuel burnup, therefore reducing both the fuel requirements, and subsequently the amount of high-level [[nuclear waste]] for disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nuclear Fuel Cycle Overview|url = http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Introduction/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle-Overview/|website = www.world-nuclear.org|accessdate = 2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although online refuelling is generally desirable, it requires design compromises which means that it is often uneconomical.  This includes added complexity to refuelling equipment, and the requirement for these to pressurise during refuelling gas and water-cooled reactors. Online refuelling equipment for [[Magnox]] reactors proved to be less reliable than the reactor systems, and retrospectively its use was regarded as a mistake.&lt;ref name=hawley-2006&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/sym/2006/restore/haw-rest.htm|title=Nuclear Power in the UK - Past, Present &amp; Future|author=Robert Hawley - former CEO of Nuclear Electric and British Energy|publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] Annual Symosium|year=2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214183208/http://www.world-nuclear.org/sym/2006/restore/haw-rest.htm|archivedate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [Molten salt reactors] and [pebble bed reactors] also require online handling and processing equipment to replace the fuel during operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.mit.edu/pebble-bed/papers1_files/Future%20for%20Nuclear%20Energy.pdf|title = A future for nuclear energy: pebble bed reactors|date = 2005|accessdate = 4 July 2015|website = |publisher = MIT|last = Kadak|first = Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactor designs with online refuelling ==
Reactors with online refuelling capability to date have typically been either liquid sodium cooled, gas cooled, or cooled by water in pressurised channels.  Water-cooled reactors utilising pressurised vessels, for example [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] and [[BWR]] reactors and their [[Generation III reactor|Generation III]] descendants, are unsuitable for online refuelling as the coolant is depressurised to allow for disassembly of the pressure vessel and therefore requires a major reactor shutdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nuclear Reactors {{!}} Nuclear Power Plant {{!}} Nuclear Reactor Technology|url = http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Power-Reactors/Nuclear-Power-Reactors/|website = www.world-nuclear.org|accessdate = 2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically carried out every 18–24 months.

Notable past and present nuclear power plant designs that have incorporated the ability to refuel online include:
* [[CANDU reactor|CANDU]] reactors: Pressurised heavy-water cooled and moderated, natural uranium fuel reactors of Canadian design.  Operated 1947–present.
* [[Magnox]] reactors: CO2-cooled, graphite-moderated, natural uranium fuel reactors of British design.  Operated 1954–2015.
* [[RBMK]] reactors: Pressurised water cooled, graphite-moderated, enriched uranium fuel reactors of Russian design.  Operated 1954–present.
* [[UNGG reactor|UNGG]] reactors: CO2-cooled, graphite-moderated, natural uranium fuel reactors of French design.  Operated 1966 - 1994.
* [[BN-350]]; [[BN-600]] &amp; [[BN-800]] reactors: Sodium cooled fast-breeder reactor of Russian design.  Operated 1973–present.
* [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor|AGR]] (Advanced gas-cooled) reactors: CO2-cooled, graphite-moderated, enriched uranium fuel reactors of British design.  Operated 1976–present.
There are a number of planned reactor designs which include provision for online refuelling, including [[pebble-bed reactor|pebble-bed]] and [[molten salt reactor|molten salt]] [[Generation IV reactors]].

The '''PUCRS Museum of Science and Technology''' is a [[Brazil]]ian museum run by the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul]] (PUCRS), located in the city of [[Porto Alegre]] in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], on Avenida Ipiranga 6681, Building 40, Parthenon in the neighborhood, near the [[PUCRS]]. The visiting hours are from Tuesdays to Sundays, from 9am to 5pm.

==Overview==
The museum was inaugurated on December 9, 1998. It is the only interactive museum of [[natural sciences]] in [[Latin America]] and one of the best in the world, offering activities for all ages and showing areas of trial-attractions on the [[universe]], [[Earth]], [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[human|man]], among others. 

The permanent exhibition area of the public has about 700 interactive experiments, covering many areas of knowledge. Even the visitor can participate in experiments that resulted in the current scientific knowledge. 

The permanent collection includes several million pieces and presents one of the best displays of natural sciences from around the country. These include parts of paleontological [[geopark]] of paleorrota, a major exhibition of birds and stuffed animals and mineral resources Brazilians, some with thousands of samples.

A '''pan-European automated clearing house''' (PE-ACH) is a [[clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] that is able to settle [[Single Euro Payments Area|SEPA]] compliant credit transfers and direct debits across the [[Euro]]zone.

At present there is only one PE-ACH in operation – [[EBA Clearing#STEP2|STEP2]] – which was established by the [[Euro Banking Association]] in April 2003. According to a survey done by Equens, in the future one PE-ACH might be less relevant as banks will settle their transactions via multiple clearing houses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Syrbe|first=Benjamin|title=European Trend Survey ‘Banks &amp; Future’|url=http://www.equens.com/knowledgeandresearch/downloads_knowledge_research.jsp|work=Equens whitepaper|publisher=Equens|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than using one central clearing house.

{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}
'''Participatory design''' (originally '''co-operative design''', now often '''co-design''') is an approach to design attempting to actively involve all  stakeholders (e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end users) in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is [[usability|usable]]. Participatory design is an approach which is focused on processes and procedures of design and is not a design style. The term is used in a variety of fields e.g. [[software design]],  [[urban design]], [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[product design]], [[sustainability]], [[graphic design]], planning, and even medicine as a way of creating environments that are more responsive and appropriate to their inhabitants' and users' cultural, emotional, spiritual and practical needs. It is one approach to [[placemaking]].

Recent research suggests that designers create more innovative concepts and ideas when working within a co-design environment with others than they do when creating ideas on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Val|last2=Ross|first2=Tracy|last3=Sims|first3=Ruth|last4=Parker|first4=Christopher J.|title=Empirical investigation of the impact of using co-design methods when generating proposals for sustainable travel solutions|journal=CoDesign|date=2015|volume=12|issue=4|pages=205–220|doi=10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trischler, Jakob, Simon J. Pervan, Stephen J. Kelly and Don R. Scott (2018), "The value of codesign: The effect of customer involvement in service design teams", Journal of Service Research, 21(1): 75-100. &lt;/ref&gt;

Participatory design has been used in many settings and at various scales. For some, this approach has a political dimension of user empowerment and democratization. For others, it is seen as a way of abrogating design responsibility and innovation by designers.

In several [[Scandinavian countries]], during the 1960s and 1970s, participatory design was rooted in work with trade unions; its ancestry also includes [[action research]] and [[Sociotechnical system|sociotechnical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpsr.org/issues/pd/ Web Page on Participatory Design] on the site of [[Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility|CPSR]]. Retrieved 13 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

In participatory design, participants (putative, potential or future) are invited to cooperate with designers, researchers and developers during an innovation process. Potentially, they participate during several stages of an innovation process: they participate during the initial exploration and problem definition both to help define the problem and to focus ideas for solution, and during development, they help evaluate proposed solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Trischler, Jakob, Simon J. Pervan, Stephen J. Kelly and Don R. Scott (2018), "The value of codesign: The effect of customer involvement in service design teams", Journal of Service Research, 21(1): 75-100. &lt;/ref&gt; Maarten Pieters and Stefanie Jansen describe co-design as part of a [[complete co-creation]] process, which refers to the "transparent process of value creation in ongoing, productive collaboration with, and supported by all relevant parties, with end-users playing a central role" and covers all stages of a development process. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 7 Principles of Complete Co-creation|last=Pieters|first=Maarten|last2=Jansen|first2=Stefanie|publisher=BIS Publishers|year=2017|isbn=978 90 6369 473 9|location=Amsterdam|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Differing terms===
In  "Co-designing for Society", [[Deborah Szebeko]] and Lauren Tan list various precursors of co-design, starting with the Scandinavian participatory design movement and then state "Co-design differs from some of these areas as it includes all stakeholders of an issue not just the users, throughout the entire process from research to implementation."&lt;ref&gt;Szebeko, D., Tan, L. Co-designing for society. AMJ 2010, 3, 9, 580-590. {{doi|10.4066/AMJ.2010.378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Elizabeth Sanders and Pieter Stappers state that "the terminology used until the recent obsession with what is now called co-creation/co-design" was "participatory design".&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, E. and Stappers, P. J: "Co-creation and the new landscapes of design." CoDesign 2008. 4(1): 5-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

From the 1960s onwards there was a growing demand for greater consideration of community opinions in major decision-making. In [[Australia]] many people believed that they were not being planned 'for' but planned 'at'. (Nichols 2009). A lack of [[Public consultation|consultation]] made the planning system seem paternalistic and without proper consideration of how changes to the [[built environment]] affected its primary users. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] 'the idea that the public should participate was first raised in 1965' (Taylor, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;86). However the level of [[participation (decision making)|participation]] is an important issue. At a minimum public [[workshops]] and hearings have now been included in almost every planning endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Stephen|title=Planning for Sustainability|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet this level of consultation can simply mean information about change without detailed participation. Involvement that 'recognises an active part in plan making' (Taylor, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;86) has not always been straightforward to achieve.  Participatory design has attempted to create a platform for active participation in the design process, for end users.

===History in Scandinavia===

Participatory design was actually born in Scandinavia and called ''cooperative design''. However, when the methods were presented to the US community 'cooperation' was a word that didn't resonate with the strong separation between workers and managers - they weren't supposed to discuss ways of working face-to-face. Hence, 'participatory' was instead used as the initial Participatory Design sessions weren't a direct cooperation between workers and managers, sitting in the same room discussing how to improve their work environment and tools, but there were separate sessions for workers and managers. Each group was participating in the process, not directly cooperating. (in historical review of Cooperative Design, at a Scandinavian conference).

In Scandinavia, research projects on user participation in [[systems development]] date back to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="BodkerS1996"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bødker |first1=S |authorlink= Susanne Bødker |year=1996 |title= Creating conditions for participation: Conflicts and resources in systems design |journal=Human Computer Interaction |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=215–236 |url= |doi= |pmid= |format= |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called "collective resource approach" developed strategies and techniques for workers to influence the design and use of [[computer applications]] at the workplace: The [[Norwegian Iron and Metal Workers Union]] (NJMF) project took a first move from traditional research to working with people, directly changing the role of the union clubs in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehn|first=P|title=Computers and Democracy - A Scandinavian Challenge|date=1987|location=Aldershot, UK: Avebury|pages=17–58|author2=Kyng, M|chapter=The Collective Resource Approach to Systems Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scandinavian projects developed an [[action research]] approach, emphasizing active co-operation between researchers and workers of the organization to help improve the latter's work situation.  While researchers got their results, the people whom they worked with were equally entitled to get something out of the project. The approach built on people's own experiences, providing for them resources to be able to act in their current situation. The view of organizations as fundamentally harmonious—according to which conflicts in an organization are regarded as pseudo-conflicts or "problems" dissolved by good analysis and increased communication—was rejected in favor of a view of organizations recognizing fundamental "un-dissolvable" conflicts in organizations (Ehn &amp; Sandberg, 1979).

In the [[Utopia project]] (Bødker et al., 1987, Ehn, 1988), the major achievements were the experience-based design methods, developed through the focus on hands-on experiences, emphasizing the need for technical and organizational alternatives (Bødker et al., 1987).

The parallel [[Florence project]] (Gro Bjerkness &amp; Tone Bratteteig) started a long line of Scandinavian research projects in the health sector. In particular, it worked with nurses and developed approaches for nurses to get a voice in the development of work and IT in hospitals. The Florence project put gender on the agenda with its starting point in a highly gendered work environment.

The 1990s led to a number of projects including the [[AT project]] (Bødker et al., 1993) and the [[EureCoop]]/[[EuroCode]] projects (Grønbæk, Kyng &amp; Mogensen, 1995).

In recent years, it has been a major challenge to participatory design to embrace the fact that much technology development no longer happens as design of isolated systems in well-defined communities of work (Beck, 2002). At the dawn of the 21st century, we use technology at work, at home, in school, and while on the move.

===Co-design===
Co-design is often used by trained designers who recognize the difficulty in properly understanding the cultural, societal, or usage scenarios encountered by their user. C. K. Prahalad and Venkat Ramaswamy are usually given credit for bringing co-creation/co-design to the minds of those in the business community with the 2004 publication of their book, The Future of Competition: Co-Creating Unique Value with Customers. They propose:

:"The meaning of value and the process of value creation are rapidly shifting from a product and firm-centric view to personalized consumer experiences. Informed, networked, empowered and active consumers are increasingly co-creating value with the firm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/10878570410699249|title=Co‐creating unique value with customers|first1=C.k.|last1=Prahalad|first2=Venkat|last2=Ramaswamy|date=1 June 2004|publisher=|journal=Strategy &amp; Leadership|volume=32|issue=3|pages=4–9|via=emeraldinsight.com (Atypon)|doi=10.1108/10878570410699249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase co-design is also used in reference to the simultaneous development of interrelated software and hardware systems. The term co-design has become popular in mobile phone development, where the two perspectives of hardware and software design are brought into a co-design process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esweek.acm.org/codesisss/|title=Embedded Systems Week - October 15-20, 2017 - Seoul, South Korea|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results directly related to integrating co-design into existing frameworks is "researchers and practitioners have seen that co-creation practiced at the early front end of the design development process can have an impact with positive, long-range consequences."&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, E. B. N., &amp; Stappers, P. J. (2008). Co-creation and the new landscapes of design. Codesign, 4(1), 5-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discourses==
Discourses in the PD literature have been sculpted by three main concerns: (1) the politics of design, (2) the nature of participation, and (3) methods, tools and techniques for carrying out design projects. (Finn Kensing1 &amp; Jeanette Blomberg, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;168)

=== Politics of design ===
The politics of design have been the concern for many design researchers and practitioners. Kensing and Blomberg illustrate the main concerns which related to the introduction of new frameworks such as system design which related to the introduction of computer-based systems and power dynamics that emerge within the workspace. The automation introduced by system design has created concerns within unions and workers as it threatened their involvement in production and their ownership over their work situation.

=== Nature of participation ===
Major international organizations such as [[Project for Public Spaces]] create opportunities for rigorous participation in the design and creation of [[Location (geography)|place]], believing that it is the essential ingredient for successful environments. Rather than simply consulting the public, PPS creates a platform for the community to participate and [[co-design]] new areas, which reflect their intimate knowledge.  Providing insights, which independent design professionals such as architects or even local government planners may not have.

Using a method called Place Performance Evaluation or (Place Game), groups from the community are taken on the site of proposed development, where they use their knowledge to develop design strategies, which would benefit the community.
"Whether the participants are schoolchildren or professionals, the exercise produces dramatic results because it relies on the expertise of people who use the place every day, or who are the potential users of the place."&lt;ref&gt;Projects for Public Spaces http://www.pps.org/info/services/our_approach/building_the_vision {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202100501/http://www.pps.org/info/services/our_approach/building_the_vision |date=2008-12-02 }} ''Building The Vision'' May 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  This successfully engages with the ultimate idea of participatory design, where various stakeholders who will be the users of the end product, are involved in the design process as a collective.

Similar projects have had success in Melbourne, Australia particularly in relation to contested sites, where design solutions are often harder to establish. The Talbot Reserve in the suburb of St. Kilda faced numerous problems of use, such as becoming a regular spot for [[sex workers]] and drug users to congregate. A Design In, which incorporated a variety of key users in the community about what they wanted for the future of the reserve allowed traditionally marginalised voices to participate in the design process.  Participants described it as 'a transforming experience as they saw the world through different eyes.' (Press, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;62).  This is perhaps the key attribute of participatory design, a process which, allows multiple voices to be heard and involved in the design, resulting in outcomes which suite a wider range of users. It builds empathy within the system and users where it is implemented, which makes solving larger problems more holistically. As planning affects everyone it is believed that 'those whose livelihoods, environments and lives are at stake should be involved in the decisions which affect them' (Sarkissian and Perglut, 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;3)

=== In the built environment ===
[[File:Keskustelutilaisuus Helsingin yleiskaavasta.jpg|thumb|A public consultation event about urban planning in Helsinki]]
Participatory design has many applications in development and changes to the [[built environment]]. It has particular currency to planners and [[architects]], in relation to [[placemaking]] and [[community]] [[urban regeneration company|regeneration]] projects. It potentially offers a far more [[democracy|democratic]] approach to the design process as it involves more than one [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]. By incorporating a variety of views there is greater opportunity for successful outcomes. Many universities and major institutions are beginning to recognise its importance. The [[UN]], Global studio involved students from [[Columbia University]], [[University of Sydney]] and [[Sapienza University of Rome]] to provide design solutions for [[Vancouver]]'s downtown eastside, which suffered from drug- and alcohol-related problems. The process allowed cross-discipline participation from planners, architects and industrial designers, which focused on collaboration and the sharing of ideas and stories, as opposed to rigid and singular design outcomes. (Kuiper, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;52)

==From community consultation to community design==

Many [[local governments]] require community consultation in any major changes to the built environment. Community involvement in the planning process is almost a standard requirement in most strategic changes. Community involvement in local decision making creates a sense of empowerment. The [[City of Melbourne]] [[Swanston Street]] redevelopment project received over 5000 responses from the public allowing them to participate in the design process by commenting on seven different design options.&lt;ref&gt;The City of Melbourne {{cite web |url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=192&amp;pa=1323&amp;pg=4460 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507134929/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=192&amp;pa=1323&amp;pg=4460 |archivedate=2009-05-07 |df= }} ''Have Your Say'' May 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  While the [[City of Yarra]] recently held a 'Stories in the Street'&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Cook http://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/Consultation/pdf/Stories%20in%20the%20Street%20Publicity%20Files.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Stories in the Street'' May 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; consultation, to record peoples ideas about the future of Smith Street. It offered participants a variety of mediums to explore their opinions such as mapping, photo surveys and storytelling. Although local councils are taking positive steps towards participatory design as opposed to traditional top down approaches to planning, many communities are moving to take design into their own hands.

[[Portland, Oregon]] [[City Repair Project]]&lt;ref&gt;City Repair {{cite web |url=http://cityrepair.org/about/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514234908/http://cityrepair.org/about/ |archivedate=2010-05-14 |df= }} "What is City repair" May 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of participatory design, which involves the community co-designing problem areas together to make positive changes to their environment. It involves collaborative decision-making and design without traditional involvement from local government or professionals but instead runs on volunteers from the community. The process has created successful projects such as intersection repair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetfilms.org/archives/intersection-repair/|title=Intersection repair|author=Clarence Eckerson Jr|date=2007-05-31|publisher=[[Streetfilms]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw a misused intersection develop into a successful community square.

[[P2P Urbanism|Peer-to-peer urbanism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/%7eyxk833/P2PURBANISM.pdf "P2P Urbanism", collection of articles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://p2pfoundation.net/P2P_Urbanism | title=P2P Urbanism | publisher=[[P2P Foundation]] | work=wiki | accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of decentralized, participatory design for urban environments and individual buildings.  It borrows organizational ideas from the [[open-source software movement]], so that knowledge about construction methods and [[urban design]] schemes is freely exchanged.

===In software development===
In the [[English language|English]]-speaking world, the term has a particular currency in the world of [[software development]], especially in circles connected to [[Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility]] (CPSR), who have put on a series of Participatory Design Conferences. It overlaps with the approach [[Extreme Programming]] takes to user involvement in design, but (possibly because of its European [[trade union]] origins) the Participatory Design tradition puts more emphasis on the involvement of a broad population of users rather than a small number of user representatives.

Participatory design can be seen as a move of end-users into the world of researchers and developers, whereas [[empathic design]] can be seen as a move of researchers and developers into the world of end-users. There is a very significant differentiation between user-design and [[user-centered design]] in that there is an emancipatory theoretical foundation, and a systems theory bedrock ([[Kristo Ivanov|Ivanov]], 1972, 1995), on which user-design is founded. Indeed, user-centered design is a useful and important construct, but one that suggests that users are taken as centers in the design process, consulting with users heavily, but not allowing users to make the decisions, nor empowering users with the tools that the experts use.  For example, [[Wikipedia]] content is user-designed. Users are given the necessary tools to make their own entries. Wikipedia's underlying [[wiki]] software is based on user-centered design: while users are allowed to propose changes or have input on the design, a smaller and more specialized group decide about features and system design.

Participatory work in software development has historically tended toward two distinct trajectories, one in Scandinavia and northern Europe, and the other in North America.  The Scandinavian and northern European tradition has remained closer to its roots in the labor movement (e.g., Beck, 2002; Bjerknes, Ehn, and Kyng, 1987).  The North American and [[Pacific rim]] tradition has tended to be both broader (e.g., including managers and executives as "stakeholders" in design) and more circumscribed (e.g., design of individual ''features'' as contrasted with the Scandinavian approach to the design of ''entire systems'' and design of the ''work that the system is supposed to support'') (e.g., Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1998; Noro and Imada, 1991).  However, some more recent work has tended to combine the two approaches (Bødker et al., 2004; Muller, 2007).

==Processes, procedures and methods==

===Distributed participatory design===
{{further|Crowdsourcing}}
'''Distributed participatory design''' ('''DPD''') is a design approach and philosophy that supports the direct participation of users and other stakeholders in system analysis and design work. Nowadays design teams most often are distributed, which stress a need for support and knowledge gathered from design of distributed systems. Distributed participatory design aims to facilitate understanding between different stakeholders in distributed design teams by giving each the opportunity to engage in hands-on activities.

Forms of distributed participatory design, or '''mass-participatory design''', are now most frequently seen online. Web-based, mass-participatory design platforms are increasingly seen in both the consumer product and architectural design industries, facilitating direct public engagement at multiple stages of the design process.&lt;ref&gt;Lorimer, A.O.D. Mass-participation Architecture, Pearl, 2016, [online] https://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk//handle/10026.1/5293 [17/08/16]&lt;/ref&gt; Website designs and planning now incorporate social networking into their interfaces to increase distributed participation. This integration helps "funnel" or redirect traffic towards a website or group of websites, increasing website exposure, traffic, and the number of access points to a website. By providing users with multiple venues for interacting with and giving feedback to companies, content creators, and other users online have been able to strengthen networks and [[online communities]].

The interconnectivity factor of online participatory design encourages users to engage in participation on websites outside those they regularly visit enabling the connection, strengthening, and creation of online communities and [[fandom]]s. On social networking websites, companies and creators create specialized pages or accounts for interacting with any users and consumers more directly and in more readily usable forms, as opposed to older methods of retrieving feedback. Through using various websites, users can participate in the design process with the medium they are most comfortable using, accommodating differences in technical background and navigating unfamiliar websites.

Feedback can typically be seen in the form of comment sections, rating systems, or reviews from which companies and content creators may determine possible future changes in design and organization. Not only does this make evaluation and feedback by users easier, but also serves as a way to more efficiently categorize and process the information in a more effective and organized manner. The use of distributed participatory design on the internet has eliminated many of the intermediate steps between a consumer's response and the company's reception thus decreasing transaction costs.

In terms of distributed participatory design, YouTube and their content creators, or YouTubers, incorporate many of these elements into their website designs and planning. Video pages contain a 'share' function that allows for individuals to circulate a link to a video through various social media sites to increase exposure and possibly redirect people to other sites content creators use for circulating media and for receiving reactions. Additionally, feedback can appear in the form of comments and ratings. Each video has separate comment sections for users to leave input and ideas in. YouTube also uses a rating system of thumbs up/thumbs down to provide the content creators with a statistic on how well a video was received. Many popular YouTubers use social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Google+ to announce video updates and any information on external projects. Through managing social networks, website, and YouTube channel, the content creators can manage the distributed participation effectively and maintain their fanbases as well as update them on any changes in the design or content creation process.

'''''Pennisetum purpureum''''', also known as '''Napier grass''', '''elephant grass''' or '''Uganda grass''', is a species of perennial tropical grass native to the African grasslands.&lt;ref name="Farrell"&gt;[Farrell, G., Simons, S. A., &amp; Hillocks, R. J. (2002). Pests, diseases, and weeds of Napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum: a review. International Journal of Pest  Management, 48(1), 39-48.]&lt;/ref&gt; It has low water and nutrient requirements, and therefore can make use of otherwise uncultivated lands.&lt;ref name="Strezov"&gt;[Strezov, V., Evans, T. J., &amp; Hayman, C. (2008). Thermal conversion of elephant grass Pennisetum purpureum Schum) to bio-gas, bio-oil and charcoal. Bioresources Technology, 99, 8394-8399.]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, this wild species has been used primarily for grazing;&lt;ref name="Khan"/&gt; recently, however, it has been incorporated into a pest management strategy. This technique involves the desired crop being planted alongside a 'push' plant, which repels pests, in combination with a 'pull' crop around the perimeter of the plot, which draw insects out of the plot.&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;[Khan, Z. R., Midega, C. A. O., Wadhams, L. J., Pickett, J. A., &amp; Mumuni, A. (2007). Evaluation of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureun) varieties for use as trap plants for the management of African stemborer (Busseola fusca) in a push-pull strategy Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 124, 201-211.]&lt;/ref&gt; Napier grass has shown potential at attracting stemborer moths (a main cause of yield loss in Africa) away from maize&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; and hence is the "pull" crop. This strategy is much more sustainable, serves more purposes and is more affordable for farmers than [[insecticide]] use. In addition to this, Napier grasses improve soil fertility, and protect arid land from [[soil erosion]]. It is also utilized for firebreaks, windbreaks, in paper pulp production and most recently to produce bio-oil, biogas and charcoal.&lt;ref name="Strezov" /&gt;

==Description==
''Pennisetum purpureum'' is a monocot C4 perennial grass in the [[Poaceae]] family.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; It is tall and forms in robust bamboo-like clumps.&lt;ref name="Farrell" /&gt; It is a heterozygous plant, but seeds rarely fully form; more often it reproduces vegetatively through stolons which are horizontal shoots above the soil that extend from the parent plant to offspring.&lt;ref name="Farrell" /&gt; This species has high biomass production, at about 40 tons/ha/year&lt;ref name="Strezov" /&gt; and can be harvested 4-6 times per year.&lt;ref name="Farrell" /&gt; Additionally it requires low water and nutrient inputs.&lt;ref name="Strezov" /&gt;

Napier can be propagated through seeds, however as seed production is inconsistent, collection is difficult.&lt;ref name="Farrell" /&gt; Alternatively, it can be planted through stem cuttings of the stolons. The cuttings can be planted by inserting them along furrows 75&amp;nbsp;cm apart, both along and between rows.&lt;ref name="Aminah"&gt;[Aminah, A. Wong, C. C. &amp; Eng P. K. (1997). Techniques for rapid vegetative multiplication for pasture species and commercial production. Regional Forage Development, FAO, Rome, pp167-178.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Push Pull Pest Management Strategy==
Stemborers (''[[Busseola fusca]]'' and ''[[Chilo partellus]]'') are the cause of 10% of total yield loss in Southern and Eastern Africa and on average 14-15% in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Farrell" /&gt; The larvae cause immense damage to maize and sorghum by burrowing into their stems and eating from within. This not only makes them difficult to detect and remove but also damages the vascular tissue necessary for plant growth.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; Insecticide effectiveness is low against stemborers, as larvae are protected by protective cell wall layers around the stem.&lt;ref name="Aminah" /&gt; Insecticides are also expensive for poor farmers and can build chemical resistance by the pests.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;[Miller, J. R., &amp; Cowles, R. S. (1990). Stimulo-deterrent diversion: A concept and its possible application to onion maggot control. Journal of Chemical Ecology, 16(11), 3197-3212.]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, chemicals are carried into final food products.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; Instead of trying to prevent the occurrence of pests, the push-pull strategy (also known as stimuli-deterrent) aims to guide their inevitable biological evolution to prevent damage to valued crops.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; The method proposes that sorghum or corn be intercropped with Desmodium (the "push" plant), which repels the moths as they look to lay their eggs. Desmodium also provides a ground cover and is nitrogen fixing, which improves soil fertility while decreasing labour involved with weeding.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; This deterrent is used in combination with Napier grass planted around the perimeter of the plot.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; A study of Kenyan farmers using the push-pull strategy reported an 89% reduction in [[Striga]] (a parasitic weed), an 83% increase in soil fertility, and 52% effectiveness in stemborer control.&lt;ref name="Khan_a"&gt;[Khan, Z. R., Amudavi, D. M., Midega, C. A. O., Wanyama, J. M., &amp; Pickett, J. A.(2008). Farmers' perceptions of a 'push-pull' technology for control of cereal stemborers and striga weed in western Kenya. Crop Protection, 27, 976-987.]&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that striga, stemborers, and low soil fertility together cause yield losses of an estimated 7 billion US dollars or enough to feed 27 million people,&lt;ref name="Khan_a" /&gt; the implementation of this technique could significantly reduce food insecurity.

===Push-pull pest management===
Although promising as a sustainable and affordable option, the success of [[Push–pull agricultural pest management|push-pull]] pest management highly depends on proper implementation in combination with other good ecological practices. Firstly, not all varieties of Napier grass function as a trap. In a study of eight varieties, only two bana and Ugandan hairless Napier varieties significantly attracted female moths for egg placement over maize.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; Of these two, only bana significantly decreased survival rates.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; In a farmer's field, it is recommended that three rows of bana Napier grass be planted as a border crop around the entire field.&lt;ref name="Aminah" /&gt; Potential exists to improve the push-pull strategy through further trials with different intercrops, by manipulating allelochemicals in each intercrop, as well as by investigating insect sensitivity to natural chemicals.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; Once prominent in a field, it is difficult to rid the area of the stemborer pests as larvae can remain dormant, and therefore push-pull management will not have the intended effect.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; It is recommended that if an infestation is particularly severe, neither corn, nor sorghum should be planted in the same field the following year but instead rotated with other crops.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; It is also important to burn infested stalks or, if they have an intended use, to leave them out in the sun for three days.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; The use of push-pull pest management must be used in combination with good ecological practices to yield the desired results.
Finally, the establishment of a push-pull system requires increased labour in the primary stages and a large enough land plot to allow space for a non-food crop to be planted; these factors often deter its adoption.&lt;ref name="Khan_a" /&gt; A program could increase adoption rates through promoting its use in combination with livestock, giving economic value to the planting of Napier.

[[Image:Harvesting Napier.jpg|thumb|Use as fodder crop in Kenya]]
Napier grass is the most important [[fodder crop]] for the [[dairy farmer]]s in [[East Africa]].&lt;ref name="Farrell" /&gt; Its high productivity makes it particularly suited to feed cattle and buffaloes. It is also an important forage for [[African elephant|elephants]] in Africa, hence its name "elephant grass".&lt;ref name="feedipedia"&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., Giger-Reverdin S., Lebas F., 2016. Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum).

Furthermore, livestock can be incorporated into the pull-push management system providing another economically viable purpose for the ‘trap’ plant. Napier grass is valuable to African landscapes as it prevents [[soil erosion]]. It can also serve as a fire break, a wind break, and to improve soil fertility.&lt;ref name="Farrell" /&gt;
More recently, Napier has been used to alleviate pressure on food production as there is 2Gha of non-arable land suitable for [[energy crop]] production.&lt;ref name="Strezov" /&gt; Thermal pyrolytic conversion is used to produce charcoal, biogas and bio-oil.&lt;ref name="Strezov" /&gt; Although this technology is not currently in use, it could be implemented as a means of providing energy to African communities, while enriching the soils of the local landscape.&lt;ref name="Strezov" /&gt; It is also used as source of fuel. The young leaves and shoots are edible and are cooked to make soups and stews.&lt;ref name="feedipedia" /&gt;

A Dutch company also successfully turned the grass into a plastic that can be used for packaging.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29674">'''Policies promoting wireless broadband''' are policies, rules, and regulations supporting the "National Wireless Initiative", a plan to bring [[wireless broadband]] [[Internet access]] to 98% of Americans.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;

Spectrum is limited and much of it already in use. This raises the issue of space and strength of supporting the network. The infrastructure has to reach across the entire United States in areas that normally do not have Internet access. The main concept is to bring wireless service to residents in areas that may otherwise not have access to it.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;[http://www.publicknowledge.org/public-knowledge-commends-obama-wireless-proposals Commends Obama Wireless Proposals] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110212072331/https://www.publicknowledge.org/public-knowledge-commends-obama-wireless-proposals |date=2011-02-12 }}. Public Knowledge (2011-02-10). Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The public's interest in this plan is important as the people are the ones who will utilize this service. Network neutrality raises issues on freedom of information and who will have control over how the information is released, or even lack of control.

The Memorandum on Unleashing the Wireless Broadband Revolution claimed that wireless Internet access had the potential to enhance economic competition and improve the quality of life.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/DCPD-201000556/pdf/DCPD-201000556.pdf Code of Federal Regulations on FDSys U.S. Government Printing Office Memorandum on Unleashing the Wireless Broadband Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet is considered an important part of the economy and advanced [[business opportunities]] as it is a vital [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; The [[Code of Federal Regulations]] says that this is the beginning of the next transformation in [[information technology]], as we encounter the wireless broadband revolution.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

==Strategy==
The initial plan by President [[George W. Bush]] was to have broadband availability for all Americans by 2007.&lt;ref name=r3&gt;[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-256694A1.pdf Federal Communications Commission FCC Task Force Recommends Actions to Speed the Rollout of Wireless Broadband Services]&lt;/ref&gt; In February, 2011, President Obama announced details of the "National Wireless Initiative" or "Wireless Innovation and Infrastructure Initiative".

[[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) Chairperson [[Michael K. Powell]] created the Wireless Broadband Access Task Force to help bring the plan together. The members study existing wireless broadband policies, making recommendations in the FCC's policies for acceleration in the deployment of the [[wireless technologies]] and services.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; This is completed by seeking out the expertise, experience, and advice of consumers, state and local governments, the industry, and other [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; These recommendations are intended to assist with how to make policies and further progress the process for the national wireless plan. They are based on the inquiry of the state of wireless broadband as well as the FCC's policies that impact these services.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;

Powell commented in a statement that this broadband plan is a [[catalyst]] for positive change, bringing resources and jobs to communities across the country.&lt;ref name=r4&gt;[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-256694A2.pdf Federal Communications Commission Separate Statement of Chairman Michael K. Powell]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CTIA The Wireless Association]] encouraged [[legislative]] action that recognizes the unique and invaluable role of [[wireless]] in providing Americans [[Internet access]].&lt;ref name=r7&gt;[http://www.ctia.org/advocacy/position_papers/index.cfm/AID/12047 Broadband Overview]. Ctia.org. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

This plan included issues such as:
*[[Radio spectrum]]
*How the radio spectrum will support national wireless broadband
*Cost of creating the wireless network
*Maintaining the network
*Who will create the network and infrastructure
*Who will support the network and infrastructure
*Consideration of what the public interest is in this plan,
*The wireless plan's policies,
*What the current [[President of the United States]] plans to do
*How the previous President George W. Bush promoted this plan.

==Spectrum==
===Freeing space===
The plan is to free up enough of the radio spectrum from licensed and unlicensed space. To free up space, the FCC intends to hold [[spectrum auction|incentive auctions]], spurring innovation, by current licensees voluntarily giving up their spectrum space.&lt;ref name=r5&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/02/10/president-obama-details-plan-win-future-through-expanded-wireless-access President Obama Details Plan to Win the Future through Expanded Wireless Access | The White House]. Whitehouse.gov (2011-02-10). Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r8/&gt;&lt;ref name=r10/&gt; The CTIA has requested the FCC to obtain more capacity on the spectrum by placing priority on additional spectrum through the national wireless plan.&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; This hopes to ensure space on the spectrum for the wireless broadband to work. The auction would also require legislation to conduct for the spectrum to be reassigned and reallocated. In this plan, legislation is needed for the FCC to hold these auctions to enable the current spectrum holders to realize a portion of the [[revenues]] if they participate.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; These voluntary incentive auctions for licensees are a critical part of freeing the spectrum, as well as encouraging the government to more efficiently use the spectrum.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; The auction is intended to bring profit back to the [[United States]] and new licensees. However, it was brought up in February 2011 that it is not clear on whether these incentive auctions will take place.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; One goal of the plan is to reduce the [[national deficit]] by approximately $10 billion through these license auctions and other business opportunities.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; The auctions and increased spectrum efficiency from the government would raise $27.8 billion over the next ten years.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; The government will be expected to use the spectrum more efficiently using new financial-compensation tools with commitments to using advanced technologies.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; There is also the idea to spur innovation by using $3 billion of the spectrum proceeds for [[research]] and development of newer wireless technologies and applications.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;

===Spectrum sections to use===
Wireless requires [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], and because of this, there would need to be enough of the spectrum obtained to sustain the bandwidth of the network. It also needs to be considered that upload links and [[downstream (computer science)|downstream]] communication can require a difference amount of space. In the FCC News in 2005, it is mentioned that there needs to be enough spectrum to account for the unbalancing of broadband services. The service typically needs a larger amount of bandwidth for downstream than for upload links.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; Wireless will only work with adequate spectrum to support the initiative and the many devices, networks, and applications that it will run.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; President Obama has set a goal of freeing 500 [[MHz]] of the spectrum for any wireless device within a decade.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; The CTIA also supports this within the next ten years.&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; The space would also need to be within the stronger part of the spectrum. According to the [[112th United States Congress]], the Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act calls for this to be within the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz D block spectrum for rural and urban areas and was originally requested to be done before the [[Digital TV transition]].&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;&lt;ref name=r8&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.28: Bill Text 112th Congress S.28.IS Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r10/&gt; The 700&amp;nbsp;MHz D block refers to the portion of the spectrum between the following frequencies

*758&amp;nbsp;MHz to 763&amp;nbsp;MHz
*788&amp;nbsp;MHz to 793&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt;&lt;ref name=r9&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h607/show H.R.607: Broadband for First Responders Act of 2011 – U.S. Congress] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311021916/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h607/show |date=2011-03-11 }}. OpenCongress (2011-04-26). Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its pursuit to support the FCC, the CTIA also recommended the spectrum in the following ranges

*1.7&amp;nbsp;GHz
*2.1&amp;nbsp;GHz bands.&lt;ref name=r7/&gt;

With [[4G]] deployment rising, it is critical to have the [[airwave (communications network)|airwave]] space to support future innovation and to avoid the spectrum crunch.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; This provides clearance in the spectrum that is already allocated to wireless carriers. The CTIA also have requested access to existing [[utility poles]] where new construction is not possible.&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; Although the spectrum is wide, the science and [[physics]] of the spectrum still create limited amounts of space.&lt;ref name=r7/&gt;&lt;ref name=r12&gt;[http://www.ctia.org/advocacy/position_papers/index.cfm/AID/12051 Net Neutrality Overview]. Ctia.org. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reserved spectrum===
President Obama also plans to increase public safety by reallocating the D block of the spectrum and $500 million within the Wireless Innovation (WIN) Fund.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; The 700&amp;nbsp;MHz D block spectrum would be reallocated and integrated for public safety entities.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt;&lt;ref name=r10/&gt; The [[Communications Act of 1934]] would be amended to increase the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] by 10&amp;nbsp;MHz for public safety.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt;&lt;ref name=r10&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727151743/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-s28/show S.28: Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act – U.S. Congress]. OpenCongress. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r9/&gt; An important part of this spectrum plan is that there is already space for public safety. One piece that needs to be determined is how to integrate the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz D block that will be reallocated with the existing public safety spectrum.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; The current 20&amp;nbsp;MHz of public safety spectrum needs to be determined how to be licensed as well. The considerations are nationwide, regional, statewide or some combination in accordance with the public interest.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt;

===Review of the spectrum use===
In Section 205 of the Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act of the [[112th United States Congress]], it is required to have a review of the use of the spectrum after a certain period of time of the deployment. After no more than 5 years of the implementation of the wireless network plan, the Commission must conduct a survey and submit a report regarding the public safety spectrum.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; This includes how the spectrum is being used, recommendations on whether more spectrum is needed and determine if there is opportunity for some of the spectrum to be returned for other commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; The report intends to make sure that there is the right amount of spectrum and ensure it is being used for the correct purposes, as there is only a limited amount of spectrum overall. From the [[Administration of Barack Obama]], they also would like to test the value of underutilized spectrum to be able to open new avenues of use.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Since spectrum space is limited, looking at other spectrum could allow other licensees to move elsewhere, perhaps freeing up more for wireless. Utilizing other spectrum would allow development of advanced technologies.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; The [[Secretary of Commerce]], [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], [[NASA]] and other organizations have been designated to create a plan to explore these innovative spectrum-sharing technologies.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

==Technology and infrastructure==
In the 1950s, the town of [[Ten Sleep, Wyoming]], had just set up their phone service using federal subsidies and stringing [[copper wire]] to every home.&lt;ref name=r17&gt;Greeley, Brendan. (2011-02-17) [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_09/b4217033849315.htm The Flaw in Obama's Wireless Plan]. ''BusinessWeek''. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, they upgraded to [[fiber optic]] cable, giving the residents high-speed Internet access.&lt;ref name=r17/&gt; This scenario caught President Obama's eye in terms of success, which he hopes to duplicate with the national wireless broadband. On February 10, 2011, he pointed to this example of what he wants to replicate and hopes it will help progress more [[economic development]] by providing Internet to almost all Americans.&lt;ref name=r17/&gt; Brendan Greenley from ''[[Business Week]]'' magazine does not believe Obama's plan will create another success story.&lt;ref name=r17/&gt; While examples are helpful to reference when creating a plan, not all plans react the same way. There are many different factors involved, such as geography and the type of users involved.

How a technology is designed and built is just as important as the technology itself. Without a proper infrastructure, a national wireless broadband network would not benefit the country. George Ford from the Phoenix Center commented that a reasonable target for broadband would be 95% Internet availability to Americans in five years and questioned the need for coverage across the entire country.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt; There has been a large [[permeation]] of Internet users over the last five years.{{When|date=June 2015}} However, there are still reasons to have wired networking. As stated by Brendan Greeley, [[call centers]] and [[Computer data storage|data storage]] facilities placed in smaller towns need the speed and capacity that a wired fiber optic network can provide.&lt;ref name=r17/&gt; Wireless networks pose challenges that wired networks do not.&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; One challenge is the infrastructure of a wireless network, like the spectrum, versus a wired network. For Ten Sleep, they installed fiber optic cable to increase their network speed. Wireless does not have this capability. Fiber optic cable has more capacity than the electromagnetic spectrum, meaning even if the entire spectrum was allocated to the national wireless network, there still would not be the same capacity in fiber optic.&lt;ref name=r12/&gt;

===New technologies===
Technology is growing at an incredible speed, with one important technology being the speed of information. The newest generation of speed at "[[4G]]" is being deployed at rapid speeds throughout the United States by the leading carriers, and promises to be greatly beneficial to the economy and society.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; Next-generation technology is ten times faster than current speeds and is capable of benefiting all Americans, helping public safety increase, and further progressing the innovation for wireless applications, equipment and services.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; The advancement of technology is intended to move us{{Who|date=June 2015}} forward and catch up with other nations that have already implemented these technologies. The technological advances in wireless broadband, like mobile broadband, provide a solid foundation for improved delivery of services.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;

===Support of the wireless network===
A supported infrastructure is important for any network, whether technologically based or socially based. The national wireless network is no different. Under Section 105 Interoperability of the bill S.28, the Commission must establish the technical and operational rules to ensure the national wireless networks are [[interoperable]].&lt;ref name=r8/&gt;&lt;ref name=r10/&gt;&lt;ref name=r9/&gt; It has so far yet to be established as to who will actually support the network, being the government or a private [[Internet service provider]]. Rules are to be established to permit a public safety licensee to authorize a service provider to construct and operate the wireless network.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt; It is also in the plan to have the service provider use their licensee spectrum if the authorization would expedite broadband communications.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt; The supporting parties will also have to ensure the safety of the network by protecting and monitoring against cyber attacks and any other form of security threat.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt;&lt;ref name=r9/&gt; It is imperative to have a secure network that is accessible for the nation to use. A safe environment is needed for new capabilities to be secure, trustworthy and provide necessary safeguards for privacy of users and public safety.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

==Cost==
President Obama estimated a one-time investment of $5 billion and a reformation of the [[Universal Service Fund]] to help millions of Americans get access to these technologies.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; Another estimated cost of the wireless broadband plan is $7.2 billion from stimulus funds.&lt;ref name=r14&gt;Rhett, Joshua. (2010-04-07) [http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/02/obamas-high-speed-internet-plan-broadband-boondoggle/ Obama's High-Speed Internet Plan: Broadband or Boondoggle?]. FoxNews.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Another plan is calling for $10.7 billion to commit to the support, development and deployment of the wireless broadband.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; Despite the cost, wireless would help with public safety [[affordance]] of greater levels of effectiveness and [[interoperability]].&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; With broadband technologies developing, equipment and services are getting faster and cheaper. Again, Obama proposes to pay for the wireless network by having [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] give back their privilege to the spectrum for government auction.&lt;ref name=r17/&gt; The auction would then be mostly profit so costs would come from the [[infrastructure]] and maintenance of the network, not the spectrum space. It is still questioned whether the costs are too high and if the end benefits outweigh those costs.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt; In a report by George Ford at [[Fox News Channel]], he stated that spending money on the last frontier of broadband has small [[incremental cost|incremental]] value.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt; Obama not only estimated a one-time investment, but also stated a public safety cost. He called for a $10.7 billion investment to ensure public safety benefits from the technology and to have $3.2 billion to reallocate the D block of the spectrum as mentioned before.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; This band of the spectrum would be reserved solely for public safety as stated under current law. Another $7 billion would be needed to support the deployment of the network, and then $500 million from the Wireless Innovation (WIN) Fund for research and development, and to [[tailor]] the network to public safety needs.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; Although many billions of dollars will go towards building this plan, reducing the national deficit by billions of dollars can be considered worthwhile. Again, President Obama does hope that this plan will cut the nation deficit by $9.6 billion over the next ten years.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;

The thought of whether the cost is too high also raises other points in the [[Mass media|media]]. John Horrigan of the [[Pew Research Center]] commented that the high cost of broadband now is why more Americans are not already using it.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt; There is also the consideration that not every American has access to a computer.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt; Although [[smartphone]]s with Internet capabilities have been on the rise for many years now, there is still a reason the entire nation is not "online". Whether it is the cost of an Internet-ready device or computer, or obtaining Internet service, cost is still a big factor for this technology. In terms of cost, one-third of Americans who do not have broadband access say cost prohibits them from purchasing it.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt;

==Impact on the people==
Public interest is important for policies promoting wireless broadband for Americans. The interest of the public is important because if the public does not condone the cost and the utility, the nation will have to cover the failure of the deployment. However, the public may also consider this to be an excellent development for our country. Part of the national wireless broadband goal is to enable businesses to grow faster, help students learn more, and assist public safety officers with having the best, state-of-the-art technology and communications available.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; During his [[State of the Union address]], President Obama announced a National Wireless Initiative to make available high speed wireless Internet services for 98% of Americans.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; This plan was primarily designed to get this technology to reach more rural areas that otherwise did not have the opportunity of obtaining the service.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt;&lt;ref name=r15&gt;[http://www.ncta.com/PublicationType/RegulatoryFiling/4229.aspx NCTA Comments 06/15/07]. NCTA.com (2007-06-15). Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 10, 2011 President Obama was commended for his proposal on pursuing the plan with the idea that this would greatly increase jobs and innovation.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; The concept of the "[[last mile]]" is often brought up for [[Internet Service Provider]]s (ISP) as they try to expand their network, often time having to stop before the last house on the block because of cost. However, even though this issue happens throughout rural areas, 57% of Americans use broadband services with 91% already having access according to the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt; Those that have Internet can access an incredible amount of information at any time as long as they have an Internet-ready device. There has also been an increase in the applications that utilize Internet services. The proliferation of wireless applications is on the rise and continues to empower users and communities.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;

===Home Internet usage===
A national wireless broadband network is not only about providing Internet access for personal computers in the home, but for anyone with a wireless Internet-ready device. In 2006, the number of households passed over for [[high-speed Internet]] was 119 million, and over the past two years, the cable industry has invested $23 billion into their networks.&lt;ref name=r15/&gt; As the number of homes serviced declines, broadband technology is able to develop. Commissioner [[Robert M. McDowell]] commented that the broadband technology has been the fastest in penetration of any technology in modern history.&lt;ref name=r15/&gt; With the broadband technology, the number of devices that are Internet-ready has been increasing year after year. Both cell phone and laptops with wireless capabilities have increased Internet usage dramatically and have each grown more prevalent since 2009.&lt;ref name="r16"&gt;Smith, Aaron. (2010-07-07) [http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Mobile-Access-2010.aspx Mobile Access 2010 | Pew Research Center's Internet &amp; American Life Project]. Pewinternet.org. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer working professionals with high Internet use, but young adults as well. About 47% of adults go online with a laptop, up from 39% as of April 2009. Also, 40% of adults use a mobile phone, up from 32% in 2009.&lt;ref name="r16"/&gt; The world has seen great technologies, and the Internet is one of the fastest growing because of the number of devices designed to utilize it. According to Pew Research, 59% of adults access the Internet wirelessly through some type of wireless device. Again, this is an increase from the 51% in April 2009.&lt;ref name="r16"/&gt; Internet access has become a critical part of our lives. The deployment and development of wireless broadband as well as other technologies is critical to ensuring this reliable and ubiquitous service is available to Americans.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;

===Impact on health matters and other public uses===
Some have not only considered personal or business related uses of national wireless, but the health related uses for hospitals and their patients. As Blair Levin from the Technology, Innovation and Government Reform Team of President Obama states, this will create a world-class broadband platform allowing modernizing of health care records and reforming education.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r14/&gt; Being able to have the instant availability to health records for doctors and patients, and being able to teach and be taught from anywhere in the United States is a concept some may never have considered, or thought possible. As John Horrigan from the Pew Research Center stated, people not understanding the technology being of relevancy to them is a bigger barrier than the cost of the technology itself.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt; Michael Powell stated Americans benefit most when policies enable consumers and businesses to fully utilize the benefits of emerging technology.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;

===Public safety===
Public safety has been mentioned in terms of the spectrum use and cost. Public safety is also important in regards to public interest. With the implementation of national wireless broadband, this initiative helps improve public safety communications. The Commission for 9/11 has noted that our [[homeland security]] is vulnerable due to lack of interoperable wireless communication among [[first responders]].&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; The plan would allow all public safety officials to be on the same network, and get the correct information quicker and safer. With 4G networking, they can be provided with a unique opportunity to deploy a system in conjunction with the commercial infrastructure already available.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;

==Network neutrality==
[[Network neutrality]] is becoming a big issue with the policies involved in the national wireless plan. If the plan comes together, the question of restricting access to the Internet is reason for concern. Network neutrality is the concept of having no rules and regulations for what consumers are able to access through the Internet by their ISPs. As stated by the CTIA, our economic conditions make it hard to understand why people want to impose network neutrality rules, and inject uncertainty in an industry that seems to be working well for the U.S.&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; This is for both wired and wireless broadband networks. These types of infrastructures cannot be managed for customers and expectations with a one-size-fits-all approach.&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; The debate is due to the types of restrictions ISPs should be allowed to have if consumers are paying for the service they want. As with wired Internet access, the CTIA has stated that they strongly believe that regulation is not necessary and may do more harm than good.&lt;ref name=r12/&gt;

More users are obtaining access to the internet and have the wireless devices to access it. It is no surprise that wireless is the fastest growing broadband service.&lt;ref name=r12/&gt; There is also an increase in the number of users that rely solely on wireless instead of wired connections. Wireless service providers are constantly competing to create the best network with the best service and quality.&lt;ref name=r12/&gt; With more towers and increased advanced technologies, wireless has become a convenient and widely accessible mode of communication. The negative, however, is the technology which wireless Internet uses. As previously stated, the spectrum itself is limited and wireless data networks rely on the finite source.&lt;ref name=r12/&gt;

Since the FCC has developed the plan to open the spectrum for the wireless network, the issue of network neutrality is cause for concern for some. The CTIA stated that the imposition of network neutrality will inject uncertainty in the market.&lt;ref name=r12/&gt; Since this concept supports users having access to the information they want through the Internet, it raises the problem of consumers having limited options. This could ultimately harm consumers and hamper innovation.&lt;ref name=r12/&gt;

==Pros vs. cons==
Pros:
*	Provides universal broadband Internet access to majority of Americans
*	Intends to reduce the national deficit by billions of dollars
*	Helps America to catch up on economic development that other countries have made years ago
*	Creates jobs that otherwise continue to be lost
*	Many Americans already switching to only wireless Internet
*	Potential to improve public safety communications with everyone being on the same network
*	Allows widespread access to health records and education

Cons:
*	Takes away freedom of Americans choosing their own Internet Service Provider
*	Uses money from the U.S. government (FCC) that could be used for other products and services
*	Removes current Internet Service Providers from the economy as they will no longer be needed by consumers
*	Loss of jobs through ISPs
*	Users may not realize the benefit of the technology and not use it to full potential
*	Could threaten network neutrality
*	Possible threat of security, cyber attacks, being one location for all information

[[File:1871 illustration rope splices.png|thumb|right|Stages in splicing the end of a rope, from ''[[Scientific American]]'', 1871]]

'''Rope splicing''' in [[ropework]] is the forming of a semi-permanent joint between two [[rope]]s or two parts of the same rope by partly untwisting and then interweaving their strands. Splices can be used to form a stopper at the end of a line, to form a loop or an eye in a rope, or for joining two ropes together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Splices are preferred to knotted rope, since while a knot typically reduces the strength by 20–40%,&lt;ref&gt;Neil Montgomery, ''Single Rope Techniques'' (Natl Speleological Society, June 1982), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; a splice is capable of attaining a rope's full strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, splicing usually results in a thickening of the line and, if subsequently removed, leaves a distortion of the rope. Most types of splices are used on 3-strand rope, but some can be done on 12-strand or greater single-braided rope, as well as most double braids.&lt;br/&gt;
While a spliced 3-strand rope's strands are interwoven to create the splice, a braided rope's splice is constructed by simply pulling the rope into its jacket. 

==Types of splices==

[[Image:Splitsar.png|thumb|Examples of splices in different stages of completion, from the ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'':  a) long splice b) tapered short splice c) eye splice d) short splice]]

*'''back splice''' (also called an '''end splice''') – A splice where the strands of the end of the rope are spliced directly back into the end without forming a loop. It is used to finish off the end of the rope to keep it from fraying. The end of the rope with the splice is about twice the thickness of the rest of the rope.  With nylon and other plastic materials, the back splice is often no longer used; the rope strands are simply fused together with heat to prevent fraying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cut Splice.gif|thumb|An unfinished cut splice]]

*'''cut splice''' (originally called '''cunt splice''') – A splice similar to the eye splice.  It is typically used for light lines (e.g., the log-line) where a single splice would tend to come undone, the rope being frequently wet.&lt;ref name="falconer"&gt;William Falconer, ''[http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ss-refs-falc-1243 Universal Dictionary of the Marine]'' (London: Thomas Cadell, 1780), 1243.&lt;/ref&gt;  It makes a very strong knot.  A cut splice is a join between two ropes, made by side splicing the ends slightly apart, to make an eye in the joined rope which lies shut when the rope is taut. Its original name was [[bowdlerize|bowdlerised]] to "cut splice".

[[Image:Splice on snap shackle.jpg|thumb|A line eye-spliced to a [[snap shackle]].]]

*'''[[eye splice]]''' – A splice where the working end is spliced into the working part forming a loop.
*'''ring splice''' – Attached the working end of a rope to a ring or clew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | isbn    = 0-07-135438-7
 | page    = 27
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''chain splice''' – Attached the working end of a rope to a chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | page    = 89
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Figure-eight knot|figure-eight "splice" knot]]'''- A splice-like bend knot used for joining two ropes.
*'''[[horseshoe splice]]''' – A cut splice where the two sides of the loop are of unequal length.
*'''long splice''' – A '''splice''' used to join two rope ends forming one rope the length of the total of the two ropes. The long splice, unlike most splice types, results in a splice that is only very slightly thicker than the rope without the splice, but sacrifices some of the strength of the short splice. It does this by replacing two of the strands of each rope end with those from the other, and cutting off some of the extra strands that result. The long splice allows the spliced rope to still fit through the same pulleys, which is necessary in some applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | page    = 94
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kurzspleiss.jpg|thumb|right|A short splice, with ends [[Whipping knot|whipped]]]]

*'''short splice''' – Also a splice used to join the ends of two ropes, but the short splice is more similar to the technique used in other splices and results in the spliced part being about twice as thick as the non spliced part, and has greater strength than the long splice. The short splice retains more of the rope strength than any knots that join rope ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Soft shackle''' – [[Dyneema]] soft shackles are strong, light and safe and are increasingly replacing stainless steel shackles.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Splices are often '''tapered'''  to make the thicker splice blend into the rest of the line. There are two main types of tapering, the standard and the "West Coast Taper". 
*'''Standard tapers''' progressively remove a portion of each remaining strand—one-third at a time is typical, resulting in a taper of two additional tucks beyond the splice—thus making each successive tuck produce a narrower splice. This is only practical with laid-lines, i.e., those made up of numerous strands laid side by side. 
*'''West Coast taper''' (also known as a Fisherman's Taper) is effected by extra-tucks of entire strands, such that the second strand is interweaved one more time than the first and the third is interweaved an additional time after the second.

==Splicing tools==
A [[fid]] is a hand tool made from wood, plastic, or bone and is used in the process of working with rope. A variety of fid diameters are available depending on the size of rope being used. Styles of fid designs include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | publisher = International Marine
 | isbn    = 0-07-135438-7
 | pages   = 12–13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Swedish fid''' is conical instrument with a somewhat long taper. 
*'''Tubular fid''' aid in splicing double-braided rope.
*'''Uni-fid''' needed to splice braid with a parallel core.

A [[Marlinspike]] is a tool, usually made of steel and often part of a sailor's pocketknife, which is used to separate strands of rope from one another. They can range in size anywhere from 3 inches to 5 feet long, with a round or flattened point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last    = Merry
 | first   = Barbara

 | year    = 2001
 | publisher = International Marine
 | isbn    = 0-07-135438-7
 | page    = 13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pulling fid is often used for smaller diameters of braided ropes. Also a Softfid is a great tool when dealing with tightly braided ropes.

'''SIE Neftehim'''{{efn|"SIE" is Scientific Industrial Enterprise. "Neftehim" is a compound of Russian words meaning "oil" and "chemistry".}} ({{lang-ru|НПП Нефтехим}}) is a Russian joint stock company based in [[Krasnodar]], undertaking [[research and development]] in the [[petrochemical industry]]. Its origins lie in the research laboratory attached to Krasnodar Refinery, which first developed the use of aluminium-platinum [[catalyst]]s in the Soviet Union. Established in its present form in 1996, the company continues to develop catalytic techniques, [[isomerization]] processes, and other [[Petroleum refining processes|petroleum refining technologies]].

==History==

Creation and establishing of the scientific and research enterprise on development and introduction of petrochemical processes in Krasnodar is closely related to solving the issue of introduction of catalytic reforming process for gasoline fractions in Russian oil refining industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nefthim.com/company/slot3// The History Of JSC SIE Neftehim]&lt;/ref&gt; The main step was construction of catalytic reforming semi-production unit, which allowed testing this process and submitting the necessary data for designing and construction of large scale commercial units. Besides, all new reforming catalysts were tested at the unit beginning with AP-56 (АП-56) and out to KR (КР) catalysts. Since the 1950s, the enterprise has been repeatedly reorganized and renamed:

* 35th (research) workshop of Krasnodar Refinery, 1948-1958
* Petrochemical department of Krasnodar VNIIneft (All-Soviet Union Scientific and Research Oil Institute), 1959-1964
* Krasnodar branch of VNIINeftekhim (All-Soviet Union Scientific and Research Petrochemical Institute), 1964-1992
* Krasnodar branch of Leningrad Scientific and Research Association “Lenneftekhim”, 1992
* Subsidiary Joint Stock Company “Neftekhim”, 1995-1997
* JSC SIE Neftehim since, April 16, 1997

The modern image, as well as research and activity trends of the enterprise started to form after its corporatization in 1995-1996. The enterprise underwent some structural changes, inefficient researches were reduced and the main efforts were focused on the major trends, i.e. reforming and isomerization of gasoline fractions. The company searches for and develops technologies and catalysts for Russian and foreign refineries. The enterprise is operated in accordance with the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system in the sphere of development and introduction of petrochemical processes.

==Company management==

JSC SIE Neftehim is directed by its major shareholders – Alexander N. Shakun (General Director) and Marina L. Fedorova (Technical Director).

==Structure of the enterprise==

* Catalysts Synthesis Department – development and improvement of the catalysts composition;
* Catalysts Testing Department – twenty-four-hour studying of catalysts samples at five bench-scale units that allow simulating hydrotreatment, reforming, isomerization and sharp rectification processes;

'''Soluforce''' is a brandname of [[Pipelife]] for a [[Reinforced Thermoplastic Pipe|Reinforced Thermoplastic Pipe (RTP)]].

==Introduction==
Soluforce is an RTP, which is a flexible pipe, supplied in long length coils up to 400m length and pressure ratings from 30 to 90&amp;nbsp;bar. In the last few years, this type of pipe has been acknowledged as the standardised solution for oilfield [[flowlines]] and also recently used offshore for water injection risers and oil flowlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bert Dalmolen |title=Reinforced thermoplastic pipe: standardised composite solution for oilfield flowlines |journal=PetroMin |year=2006 |volume= |issue=October |pages=30–37 |url=http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/poct06/t30.pdf |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3AReinforced+thermoplastic+pipe%3A+standardised+composite+solution+for+oilfield+flowlines&amp;as_publication=PetroMin&amp;as_ylo=2006&amp;as_yhi=2006&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008112330/http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/poct06/t30.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very great advantage of this pipe is also its very fast installation time compared to steel pipe as speeds up to 1000&amp;nbsp;m/h have been reached installing RTP in ground surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Soluforce |title=Soluforce lays Sumatra pipeline in a jiffy |journal=PetroMin |year=2006 |volume= |issue=December |pages=32–34 |url=http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/pdec06/t32.pdf |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3ASoluforce+lays+Sumatra+pipeline+in+a+jiffy&amp;as_publication=PetroMin&amp;as_ylo=2006&amp;as_yhi=2006&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008112344/http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/pdec06/t32.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

A '''suicide booth''' is a fictional machine for committing [[suicide]]. Suicide booths appear in numerous fictional settings, including the American animated series ''[[Futurama]]'' and the [[manga]] ''[[Battle Angel Alita|Gunnm/Battle Angel Alita]]''. Compulsory self-execution booths were also featured in an episode of the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' TV series entitled "[[A Taste of Armageddon]]".

The concept can be found as early as 1893. When a series of suicides were vigorously discussed in United Kingdom newspapers, critic [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]] suggested that in the [[golden age]] there would be penny-in-the-slot machines by which a man could kill himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Glasgow Herald|date=August 22, 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Orthodoxy (1908)|author=[[G.K. Chesterton]]|pages=64–65|title-link=Orthodoxy (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern writer [[Martin Amis]] provoked a small controversy in January 2010 when he facetiously advocated "suicide booths" for the elderly, of whom he wrote:
{{quote|There’ll be a population of demented very old people, like an invasion of terrible immigrants, stinking out the restaurants and cafes and shops...There should be a booth on every corner where you could get a Martini and a medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article6996980.ece?token=null&amp;offset=36&amp;page=4 | work=The Times | location=London | title=Martin Amis and the sex war | first=Camilla | last=Long | date=2010-01-24 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==Early mentions==
Following Archer's statement in 1893, the 1895 story "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]" by [[Robert W. Chambers]] featured the [[Governor of New York]] presiding over the opening of the first "Government Lethal Chamber" in the then-future year of 1920, after the repeal of laws against suicide:
{{quote|"The Government has seen fit to acknowledge the right of man to end an existence which may have become intolerable to him, through physical suffering or mental despair." [...] He paused, and turned to the white Lethal Chamber. The silence in the street was absolute. "There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life."{{Cite quote|date=February 2017}}}}

However, as Chambers's protagonist who relates the story is suffering from brain damage, it remains ambiguous whether or not he is an [[unreliable narrator]].

In [[Robert Sheckley]]'s ''[[Immortality, Inc.]]'' ([[1959 in literature|1959]]), the protagonist wakes up in an unfamiliar future and, while wandering dazed in a starkly changed New York, finds himself in what he thinks might be a bread line, but turns out to be a line for the suicide booths.{{cn|date=February 2017}} In the movie ''[[Freejack]]'' (loosely based on ''Immortality, Inc.''), suicide booths are not shown, but advertisements for suicide-assistance services are visible against the city skyline.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

In [[Ivan Yefremov|Ivan Efremov]]'s 1968 novel ''[[The Bull's Hour]]'', suicide booths are referred to as the "palaces of tender death" ({{lang-ru|Дворцы нежной смерти}}). They're commonly used on the planet Tormance to control [[population growth]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

[[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s "purple-roofed Ethical Suicidal Parlors" appear in two stories: "[[Welcome to the Monkey House (short story)|Welcome to the Monkey House]]" and "[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]". In these Ethical Suicide Parlors, a patron receives a free meal in the adjoining [[Howard Johnson's]] diner before committing suicide. It is considered a citizen's patriotic duty to commit suicide, again as a means of [[population control]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

In [[John Christopher]]'s novel ''[[The City of Gold and Lead]]'', human slaves in the aliens' domed cities voluntarily use the "Place of Happy Release" when they are no longer able to serve. The slave is killed instantly and then cremated.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

While not a booth, suicide chambers are used to allow people to choose a pleasant form of [[euthanasia]] in the movie ''[[Soylent Green]]''.{{cn|date=February 2017}} The character Sol Roth ([[Edward G. Robinson]]) leaves a note saying that he is "going home," a euphemism for committing state-approved suicide via a large, well-appointed, attended suicide chamber. Music and a video chosen by the client are played while he or she waits for the [[drugs]] to take their fatal effect. Roth chooses [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Pastoral Symphony]] and a video of Earth's natural wonders and scenes of pastoral beauty.

In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[The City and the Stars]]'', set well over a billion years in the future, in the city Diaspar, human beings resort to suicide when they are tired of life, but with the provision of being re-created at some future date. The computers that store memories of suicided humans decide when and whom to resurrect. Sometimes they create a person who has never existed before.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==''Futurama''==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Suicide Booth.JPG|thumb|right|A 'Stop-and-Drop' brand suicide booth, as seen in the first episode of ''[[Futurama]]'']] --&gt;
In the world of ''[[Futurama]]'', Stop-and-Drop suicide booths resemble [[phone booth]]s and cost one [[Quarter (U.S. coin)|quarter]] per use. The booths have at least three modes of death: "quick and painless", "slow and horrible",&lt;ref name="spacepilot"&gt;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&lt;/ref&gt; and "clumsy bludgeoning"&lt;ref name="billionbucks"&gt;''[[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs]]''&lt;/ref&gt; though, it is also implied that "electrocution, with a side order of poison" exists,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and that the eyes can be scooped out for an extra charge.&lt;ref name="billionbucks"/&gt; After a mode of death is selected and executed, the machine cheerfully says, "You are now dead. Thank you for using Stop-and-Drop, America's favorite suicide booth since 2008", or in ''[[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs]]'', "You are now dead, please take your receipt", and at this time many untaken receipts are shown.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117491967.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1&amp;query=Futurama| title=Futurama| author=Ray Richmond| date=1999-03-26| accessdate=2007-09-15| work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first appearance of a suicide booth in ''Futurama'' is in "[[Space Pilot 3000]]", in which the character [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] wants to use it.&lt;ref name="spacepilot" /&gt; [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] at first mistakes the suicide booth for a phone booth, and Bender offers to share it with him. Fry requests a [[collect call]], which the machine interprets as a "slow and horrible" death. It then turns out that "slow and horrible" can be survived by pressing oneself against the side of the booth, leading Bender to accuse the machine of being a [[rip-off]]. In ''[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score]]'', after failing to initially chase down Fry in the year 2000, Bender wants to kill himself, but mistakes a regular phone booth for a suicide booth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score]]&lt;/ref&gt; A suicide booth reappeared in ''[[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs]]'' where Bender once again attempts to end his life, but is saved when dropped into the League of Robots' lair.&lt;ref&gt;[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score]]&lt;/ref&gt; During the season 6 episode "[[Ghost in the Machines]]", Bender commits suicide in a booth named Lynn that is still angry at him over the end of their relationship six months earlier; his ghost eventually makes its way back to his body so he can continue living.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghost in the Machines]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to series co-creator [[Matt Groening]], the suicide booth concept was inspired by a 1937 [[Donald Duck]] cartoon, ''[[Modern Inventions]]'', in which Donald Duck visits a Museum of the Future and is nearly killed by various push button gadgets.&lt;ref name="Groening"&gt;{{cite video| people=Groening, Matt |date=2003|title=Futurama season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Space Pilot 3000"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suicide booth was closely enough associated with Bender's character that in 2001 it was featured as the display stand for the Bender action figure.&lt;ref name="SciFiWeekly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/cool/sfw7099.html |title=Futurama Action Figures |author=Huxter, Sean |date=2001-06-11 |accessdate=2007-11-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093855/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/cool/sfw7099.html |archivedate=2007-08-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also one of the many features of the series which troubled the executives at [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] when Groening and [[David X. Cohen]] first pitched the series.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/15-12/ff_futurama| title=Futurama Is Back! Grab a Can of Slurm and Settle In| journal=Wired| author=Baker, Chris| date=2007-11-27| accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[A Taste of Armageddon]]", people who were deemed war casualties by the government of [[Eminiar VII]] were required to enter suicide booths. Treaty arrangements require that everyone who is calculated as "dead" in the hypothetical thermonuclear war simulated using computers actually die, without actually damaging any infrastructure. In the end, the computers are destroyed, the war can no longer be calculated in this way, the treaty breaks down, and faced with a real threat, (presumably) peace begins.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

After the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] mass suicide event was linked by tabloids to an extreme fascination with science fiction and ''Star Trek'' in particular it was noted that multiple episodes, including "A Taste of Armageddon", actually advocated an anti-suicide standpoint as opposed to the viewpoint expressed by the Heaven's Gate group.&lt;ref name="Phoenix New Times"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-03-26/calendar/sci-fi-so-good/| author=Moorhead, M.V.| title=Sci-Fi, So Good| date=1998-03-26| accessdate=2007-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[The Simpsons (season 17)|seventeenth season]] ''[[Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Million Dollar Abie]]", a suicide machine called a "diePod" (a pun on the [[iPod]]) is featured. The diePod allows the patient to choose visual and auditory themes that present themselves as the patient is killed. It also shows three different modes, namely, "Quick Painless Death", "Slow and Painful Death", and "Megadeath" (a pun on a [[Megadeth|band of a similarly spelled name]]). It was a reference to the suicide building in ''[[Soylent Green]]''. Being a direct parody of the aforementioned scene, [[Abraham Simpson]] receives the opportunity to select his final vision and musical accompaniment: 1960s-era footage of "[[Police officer|cops]] beatin' up [[hippies]]" to the tune of "[[Pennsylvania 6-5000 (song)|Pennsylvania 6-5000]]" by the [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

In the ''[[Battle Angel Alita]]'' series, the suicide booth is located in Tiphares and is called 'EndJoy'. The Endjoy was a public suicide booth located in the Dome Park of Tiphares. As the Endjoy was entered it played soothing music and a message stating "Welcome to Endjoy, now just relax and step into the inner hatch". After Alita destroyed it, she pulled out a giant grinder from down below the structure. According to Dr. Russell it is every Tipharian's right to end their own life if they wish. Using the Endjoy is considered a privilege and the invention of a superior race. Presumably constructed by the Medical Inspection Bureau (M.I.B.), Alita noticed people going into it, but not coming out after she was resurrected on Tiphares by Desty Nova. She entered the Endjoy to investigate and tore it to shreds, ripping out the grinder and exposing a current of water that she used to wash herself of the dead Tiphareans' blood. Russell was shocked at Alita's actions, but was forced to reveal what had happened to Lou Collins. Despite Alita's actions, she was not targeted by the M.I.B.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

In the movie ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]'', set in 2274 CE, the remnants of human civilization live in a sealed domed city, a pseudo-utopia run by a computer that manages all aspects of their lives, including reproduction. The citizens live a mostly hedonistic lifestyle, but have been told that, in order to maintain the city, every resident must undergo the ritual of "Carrousel" at the age of 30, where they are vaporized with the promise of being "Renewed".{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==In reality==
{{See also|Euthanasia device}}
[[Image:Euthanasia machine (Australia).JPG|thumb|240px|This [[euthanasia device]] was invented by Dr [[Philip Nitschke]]. Four terminally-ill Australians used it to end their lives with a lethal dose of drugs after they answered "yes" to a series of questions on the lap-top screen. This procedure was legal in Australia's Northern Territory between 1995 and 1997.]]

The closest thing to a suicide booth to have been actually constructed is the "Euthanasia Machine" invented by [[Philip Nitschke]], consisting of software titled "Deliverance", which asks the patient a series of questions, and automatically administers a [[lethal injection]] if the correct answers are made. The system and questions are so constructed that the supplier of the machine cannot be held responsible for ending the life of the patient, who takes responsibility by operating it.

The machine was legalized for a short time as it was solely constructed for those suffering from various diseases to end their life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27316">The environmental '''[[sustainability]]''' problem has proven difficult to solve. The modern [[environmental movement]] has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe [[ecological footprint]] overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the [[climate change]] problem. Something within the human system is preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior. That system trait is '''systemic change resistance'''. Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance, barriers to change, or policy resistance.&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, pp 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of resistance to solving the sustainability problem==

While environmentalism had long been a minor force in political change, the movement strengthened significantly in the 1970s with the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970, in which over 20 million people participated, with publication of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972, and with the first [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in Stockholm in 1972. Early expectations the problem could be solved ran high. 114 out of 132 members of the United Nations attended the Stockholm conference. The conference was widely seen at the time as a harbinger of success:&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Encyclopedia, Second Edition, W. P. Cunningham et al., editors, 1998, page 1054.&lt;/ref&gt;

: "Many believe the most important result of the conference was the precedent it set for international cooperation in addressing environmental degradation. The nations attending agreed they shared responsibility for the quality of the environment, particularly the oceans and the atmosphere, and they signed a declaration of principles, after extensive negotiations, concerning their obligations. The conference also approved an environmental fund and an ‘action program,’ which involved 200 specific recommendations for addressing such problems as global climate change, [[marine pollution]], population growth, the dumping of toxic wastes, and the preservation of biodiversity. A permanent environment unit was established for coordinating these and other international efforts. [This later became] the United Nations Environmental Program [which was] was formally approved by the General Assembly later that same year and its base established in Nairobi, Kenya. This organization not only coordinated action but monitored research, collecting and disseminating information, and it has played an ongoing role in international negotiations about environmental issues.

:"The conference in Stockholm accomplished almost everything the preparatory committed had planned. It was widely considered successful, and many observers were almost euphoric about the extent of agreement."

However, despite the work of a worldwide [[environmental movement]], many national environmental protection agencies, creation of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], and many international environmental treaties, the sustainability problem continues to grow worse. The latest [[ecological footprint]] data shows the world’s footprint increased from about 50% ''undershoot'' in 1961 to 50% ''overshoot'' in 2007, the last year data is available.&lt;ref&gt;John Talbert et al., The Genuine Progress Indicator 2006, A Tool for Sustainable Development, Redefining Progress, The Nature of Economics, 2006, available at [http://www.rprogress.org/publications/2007/GPI%202006.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 the first edition of ''The Limits to Growth'' analyzed the environmental sustainability problem using a [[system dynamics]] model. The widely influential book predicted that:&lt;ref&gt;"The Limits to Growth", Meadows et al., 1972, p23.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"If the present trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity some time in the 21st century."

Yet thirty-two years later in 2004 the third edition reported that:&lt;ref&gt;"Limits to Growth", Meadows et al., 2004, p xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"[The second edition of Limits to Growth] was published in 1992, the year of the global summit on environment and development in Rio de Janeiro. The advent of the summit seemed to prove that global society had decided to deal seriously with the important environmental problems. But we now know that humanity failed to achieve the goals of Rio. The Rio plus 10 conference in Johannesburg in 2002 produced even less; it was almost paralyzed by a variety of ideological and economic disputes, [due to] the efforts of those pursuing their narrow national, corporate, or individual self-interests.

:"...humanity has largely squandered the past 30 years."

Change resistance runs so high that the world’s top two greenhouse gas emitters, [[China]] and the [[United States]], have never adopted the [[Kyoto Protocol]] treaty. In the US resistance was so strong that in 1999 the US Senate voted 95 to zero against the treaty by passing the [[Byrd–Hagel Resolution]], despite the fact [[Al Gore]] was vice-president at the time. Not a single senator could be persuaded to support the treaty, which has not been brought back to the floor since.

Due to prolonged change resistance, the climate change problem has escalated to the climate change crisis. [[Greenhouse gas]] emissions are rising much faster than [[IPCC]] models expected: “The growth rate of [fossil fuel] emissions was 3.5% per year for 2000-2007, an almost four fold increase from 0.9% per year in 1990-1999. … This makes current trends in emissions higher than the worst case IPCC-SRES scenario.” &lt;ref&gt;"Emissions rising faster this decade than last", CISIRO Media Release, September 25, 2008, available at [http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/Press%20Release_CSIRO_Australia_final.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Copenhagen Climate Summit]] of December 2009 ended in failure.&lt;ref name="Hartwell"&gt;"The Hartwell Paper", Prins, Gwrn et al., May 2010, available at [http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27939/1/HartwellPaper_English_version.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; No agreement on binding targets was reached. The [[Cancun climate summit|Cancun Climate Summit]] in December 2010 did not break the deadlock. The best it could do was another non-binding agreement:&lt;ref&gt;Outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention, 2010, available at [http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_16/application/pdf/cop16_lca.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:“Recognizing that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet, and thus requires to be urgently addressed by all Parties.”

This indicates no progress at all since 1992, when the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] was created at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The 2010 Cancun agreement was the functional equivalent of what the 1992 agreement said:&lt;ref&gt;''United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change'', United Nations, 1992, p2-4, available at [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/conveng.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The Parties to this Convention... [acknowledge] that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response.... [thus the parties recognize] that States should enact effective environmental legislation... [to] protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind...."

Negotiations have bogged down so pervasively that: “Climate policy is gridlocked, and there’s virtually no chance of a breakthrough.” &lt;ref&gt;“Disaster at the Top of the World”, Thomas Homer-Dixon, New York Times, August 22, 2010, available at [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/opinion/23homer-dixon.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all].&lt;/ref&gt; “Climate policy, as it has been understood and practised by many governments of the world under the Kyoto Protocol approach, has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years.” &lt;ref name="Hartwell" /&gt;

These events suggest that change resistance to solving the sustainability problem is so high the problem is currently unsolvable.

==The change resistance and proper coupling subproblems==

Understanding change resistance requires seeing it as a distinct and separate part of the sustainability problem. Tanya Markvart’s 2009 thesis on ''Understanding Institutional Change and Resistance to Change Towards Sustainability'' stated that:&lt;ref name="Markvart"&gt;Tanya I. Markvart, ''Understanding Institutional Change and Resistance to Change Towards Sustainability: An Interdisciplinary Theoretical Framework and Illustrative Application to Provincial-Municipal Aggregates Policy'', 2009, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, pages 4, iii, and 157. Available at [http://www.environment.uwaterloo.ca/research/biosphere/Documents/Markvart_Tanya_000.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"It has also been demonstrated that ecologically destructive and inequitable institutional systems can be highly resilient and resistant to change, even in the face of social-ecological degradation and/or collapse (e.g., Berkes &amp; Folke, 2002; Allison &amp; Hobbs, 2004; Brown, 2005; Runnalls, 2008; Finley, 2009; Walker et al., 2009)."

The thesis focuses specifically on developing “an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for understanding institutional change and resistance to change towards sustainability.”

Jack Harich's 2010 paper on ''Change Resistance as the Crux of the Environmental Sustainability Problem'' argues there are two separate problems to solve.&lt;ref name="Harich"&gt;Jack Harich, [http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/009/ChangeResistanceAsCrux.htm “Change Resistance as the Crux of the Environmental Sustainability Problem”], ''System Dynamics Review'', January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[root cause analysis]] and a [[system dynamics]] model were used to explain how:

:"...difficult social problems [like sustainability must be decomposed] into two sequential subproblems: (1) ''How to overcome change resistance'' and then (2) ''How to achieve proper coupling''. This is the timeless strategy of divide and conquer. By cleaving one big problem into two, the problem becomes an order of magnitude easier to solve, because we can approach the two subproblems differently and much more appropriately. We are no longer unknowingly attempting to solve two very different problems simultaneously."

The paper discussed the two subproblems:

: "''Change resistance'' is the tendency for a system to continue its current behavior, despite the application of force to change that behavior.

: "''Proper coupling'' occurs when the behavior of one system affects the behavior of other systems in a desirable manner, using the appropriate [[feedback loops]], so the systems work together in harmony in accordance with design objectives. … In the environmental sustainability problem the human system has become improperly coupled to the greater system it lives within: the environment.

:"Change resistance versus proper coupling allows a crucial distinction. Society is aware of the proper practices required to live sustainably and the need to do so. But society has a strong aversion to adopting these practices. As a result, problem solvers have created thousands of effective (and often ingenious) proper practices. But they are stymied in their attempts to have them taken up by enough of the system to solve the problem because an 'implicit system goal' is causing insurmountable change resistance. ''Therefore systemic change resistance is the crux of the problem and must be solved first.''"
 
The proper coupling subproblem is what most people consider as “the” problem to solve. It is called [[Decoupling (organizational studies)|decoupling]] in economic and environmental fields, where the term refers to economic growth without additional environmental degradation. Solving the proper coupling problem is the goal of environmentalism and in particular [[ecological economics]]: “Ecological economics is the study of the interactions and co-evolution in time and space of human economies and the ecosystems in which human economies are embedded.” &lt;ref&gt;The New Pelgrave Dictionary of Economics Online, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000221&amp;edition=current&amp;q=ecological%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1/ abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

Change resistance is also called barriers to change. Hoffman and Bazerman, in a chapter on “Understanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action,” concluded that:&lt;ref&gt;"Organizations and the Sustainability Mosaic: Crafting Long-Term Ecological and Societal Solutions", Sharma, S. et al., (Ed), 2007. Chapter 4, Hoffman, A. J., and Bazerman, M. H., "Changing practice on sustainability: Understanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action," p85.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In this chapter, we argue that the change in thinking required of the sustainability agenda will never come to fruition within practical domains unless proper attention is given to the sources of individual and social resistance to such change. The implementation of wise management practices cannot be accomplished without a concurrent set of strategies for surmounting these barriers."

[[John Sterman]], current leader of the system dynamics school of thought, came to the same conclusion:&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, 2008. "Risk Communication on Climate Change: Mental Models and Mass Balance." ''Science'', October 2008, vol. 322, no. 5901, pp 532-533.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The civil rights movement provides a better analogy for the climate challenge. Then, as now, entrenched special interests vigorously opposed change. … Of course, we need more research and technical innovation—money and genius are always in short supply. But there is no purely technical solution for climate change. For public policy to be grounded in the hard-won results of climate science, we must now turn our attention to the dynamics of social and political change."

These findings indicate there are at least two subproblems to be solved: change resistance and proper coupling. Given the human system’s long history of unsuccessful attempts to self-correct to a sustainable mode, it appears that high change resistance is preventing proper coupling. This may be expressed as an emerging principle: systemic change resistance is the crux of the sustainability problem and must be solved first, before the human system can be properly coupled to the greater system it lives within, the environment.

==Systemic versus individual change resistance==

Systemic change resistance differs significantly from individual change resistance. “Systemic means originating from the system in such a manner as to affect the behavior of most or all social agents of certain types, as opposed to originating from individual agents.” &lt;ref name="Harich" /&gt; Individual change resistance originates from individual people and organizations. How the two differ may be seen in this passage:&lt;ref&gt;Dent, Eric and Goldberg, Susan. 1999. ''Challenging Resistance to Change'', The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, Vol. 35, No. 1, 25-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The notion of resistance to change is credited to Kurt Lewin. His conceptualization of the phrase, however, is very different from today’s usage. [which treats resistance to change as a psychological concept, where resistance or support of change comes from values, habits, mental models, and so on residing within the individual] For Lewin, resistance to change could occur, but that resistance could be anywhere in the system. As Kotter (1995) found, ''it is possible for the resistance to be sited within the individual, but it is much more likely to be found elsewhere in the system. ''

:"Systems of social roles, with their associated patterns of attitudes, expectations, and behavior norms, share with biological systems the characteristic of homeostasis—i.e., tendencies to resist change, to restore the previous state after a disturbance.

:"Lewin had been working on this idea, that the status quo represented an equilibrium between the barriers to change and the forces favoring change, since 1928 as part of his field theory. He believed that some difference in these forces—weakening of the barriers or strengthening of the driving forces—was required to produce the unfreezing that began a change."

If sources of systemic change resistance are present, they are the principal cause of individual change resistance. According to the [[fundamental attribution error]] it is crucial to address systemic change resistance when present and avoid assuming that change resistance can be overcome by bargaining, reasoning, inspirational appeals, and so on. This is because:&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, p28.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"A fundamental principle of system dynamics states that the structure of the system gives rise to its behavior. However, people have a strong tendency to attribute the behavior of others to dispositional rather than situational factors, that is, to character and especially character flaws rather than the system in which these people are acting. The tendency to blame the person rather than the system is so strong psychologists call it the 'fundamental attribution error.' "

[[Peter Senge]], a thought leader of [[systems thinking]] for the business world, describes the structural source of systemic change resistance as being due to an “implicit system goal:” &lt;ref&gt;Peter Senge, ''The Fifth Discipline'', 1990, p88.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In general, balancing loops are more difficult to see than reinforcing loops because it often looks like nothing is happening. There’s no dramatic growth of sales and marketing expenditures, or nuclear arms, or lily pads. Instead, the balancing process maintains the status quo, even when all participants want change. The feeling, as Lewis Carroll’s Queen of Hearts put it, of needing ‘all the running you can do to keep in the same place’ is a clue that a balancing loop may exist nearby.

:"Leaders who attempt organizational change often find themselves unwittingly caught in balancing processes. To the leaders, it looks as though their efforts are clashing with sudden resistance that seems to come from nowhere. In fact, as my friend found when he tried to reduce burnout, the resistance is a response by the system, trying to maintain an ''implicit system goal''. Until this goal is recognized, the change effort is ''doomed to failure.''"

Senge’s insight applies to the sustainability problem. Until the “implicit system goal” causing systemic change resistance is found and resolved, change efforts to solve the proper coupling part of the sustainability problem may be, as Senge argues, “doomed to failure.”

==The current focus is on proper coupling==

Presently environmentalism is focused on solving the proper coupling subproblem. For example, the following are all proper coupling solutions. They attempt to solve the direct cause of the sustainability problem’s symptoms:
* The [[Kyoto Protocol]]
* The [[Waste hierarchy|Three Rs]] of reduce, reuse, recycle
* More use of [[renewable energy]]
* Better [[pollution control]] of many kinds
* Collective management of [[common-pool resources]]
* Certification programs to reduce deforestation such as [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification|PEFC]] and [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]
* [[Contour farming]] to reduce soil erosion
* The [[green revolution]]
* [[Zero population growth]]

The direct cause of environmental impact is the three factors on the right side of the [[I PAT|I=PAT equation]] where '''I'''mpact equals '''P'''opulation times '''A'''ffluence (consumption per person) times '''T'''echnology (environmental impact per unit of consumption). It is these three factors that solutions like those listed above seek to reduce.

The top environmental organization in the world, the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), focuses exclusively on proper coupling solutions:&lt;ref&gt;UNEP 2010 Annual Report, p8, Available at [http://www.unep.org/annualreport/2010/pdfs/UNEP-AR-2010-FULL-REPORT.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"2010 marked the beginning of a period of new, strategic and transformational direction for UNEP as it began implementing its Medium Term Strategy (MTS) for 2010-2013 across six areas: Climate change; Disasters and conflicts; Ecosystem management; Environmental governance; Harmful substances and hazardous waste; Resource efficiency, Sustainable consumption and production."

The six areas are all direct practices to reduce the three factors of the I=PAT equation.
 
[[Al Gore]]s' 2006 documentary film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' described the climate change problem and the urgency of solving it. The film concluded with Gore saying:

:"Each one of us is a cause of global warming, but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we buy, the electricity we use, the cars we drive; we can make choices to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero. The solutions are in our hands, ''we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will. '' But in America, the will to act is a renewable resource."

The four solutions Gore mentions are proper coupling practices. There is, however, a hint of acknowledgement that overcoming systemic change resistance is the real challenge, when Gore says “...we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will.”

The twenty-seven solutions that appear during the film’s closing credits are mostly proper coupling solutions. The first nine are:&lt;ref&gt;''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'': Closing Credits, available at [http://www.folklib.net/index/wi/ait_closing_credits.shtml].&lt;/ref&gt;

* Go to [http://www.climatecrisis.net www.climatecrisis.net]
* You can reduce your carbon emissions. In fact, you can even reduce your carbon emissions to zero.
* Buy energy efficient appliances &amp; light bulbs.
* Change your thermostat (and use clock thermostats) to reduce energy for heating &amp; cooling.
* Weatherize your house, increase insulation, get an energy audit.
* Recycle.
* If you can, buy a hybrid car.
* When you can, walk or ride a bicycle.
* Where you can, use light rail &amp; mass transit.

Some solutions are attempts to overcome individual change resistance, such as:

* Tell your parents not to ruin the world that you will live in.
* If you are a parent, join with your children to save the world they will live in.
* Vote for leaders who pledge to solve this crisis.
* Write to congress. If they don’t listen, run for congress.
* Speak up in your community.

However none of the twenty-seven solutions deal with overcoming systemic change resistance.

==Overcoming systemic change resistance==

Efforts here are sparse because environmentalism is currently not oriented toward treating systemic change resistance as a distinct and separate problem to solve.

On how to specifically overcome the change resistance subproblem, Markvart examined two leading theories that seemed to offer insight into change resistance, [[Panarchy]] theory and [[New institutionalism|New Institutionalism]], and concluded that:&lt;ref name="Markvart" /&gt;

:"...neither theory devotes significant attention to understanding the dynamics of resilient and resistant but inefficient and/or unproductive institutional and ecological systems. Overall, more research is required...."

Taking a [[root cause analysis]] and [[system dynamics]] modeling approach, Harich carefully defined the three characteristics of a [[root cause]] and then found a main systemic root cause for both the change resistance and proper coupling subproblems.&lt;ref name="Harich" /&gt; Several sample solution elements for resolving the root causes were suggested. The point was made that the exact solution policies chosen do not matter nearly as much as finding the correct systemic root causes. Once these are found, how to resolve them is relatively obvious because once a root cause is found by structural modeling, the high leverage point for resolving it follows easily. Solutions may then push on specific structural points in the social system, which due to careful modeling will have fairly predictable effects.

This reaffirms the work of [[Donella Meadows]], as expressed in her classic essay on [[Twelve leverage points|Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System]]. The final page stated that:

:"The higher the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it."

Here Meadows refers to the leverage point for resolving the proper coupling subproblem rather than the leverage point for overcoming change resistance. This is because the current focus of environmentalism is on proper coupling.

However, if the leverage points associated with the root causes of change resistance exist and can be found, the system will not resist changing them. This is an important principle of social system behavior.

For example, Harich found the main root cause of successful systemic change resistance to be high "deception effectiveness." The source was special interests, particularly large for-profit corporations. The high leverage point was raising "general ability to detect manipulative deception." This can be done with a variety of solution elements, such as "The Truth Test." This effectively increases truth literacy, just as conventional education raises reading and writing [[literacy]]. Few citizens resist literacy education because its benefits have become so obvious.

Promotion of [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) has been used to try to overcome change resistance to solving social problems, including environmental sustainability. This solution strategy has not worked well because it is voluntary and does not resolve root causes. [[Milton Friedman]] explained why CSR fails: "The social responsibility of business is to increase profits." &lt;ref&gt;"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits", Milton Friedman, September 13, 1970, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', available at [http://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/libertarians/issues/friedman-soc-resp-business.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Business cannot be responsible to society. It can only be responsible to its shareholders.

The '''Système d'aide à la conduite, à l'exploitation et à la maintenance''' ('''SACEM''') is an [[Embedded system|embedded]], automatic speed [[train protection system]] for [[rapid transit]] railways. The name means "Driver Assistance, Operation, and Maintenance System".

It was developed in [[France]] by [[GEC-Alsthom]] and [[Siemens]] in the 1980s. It was first deployed on the [[RER A]] suburban railway in [[Paris]] in 1989.

Afterwards it was installed:
* on the [[Santiago Metro]] in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]];
* on some of the [[MTR]] lines in [[Hong Kong]] (such as the [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]] and [[Tung Chung Line]]), all enhanced with [[Automatic train operation|ATO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.checkerboardhill.com/2011/04/railway-signalling-on-the-mtr-underground/|title=Railway signalling on the MTR underground|last=Wong|first=Marcus|date=2011-04-12|website=Checkerboard Hill, Private blog|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and 
* on some of the [[Mexico City Metro]] lines in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w5.siemens.com/france/web/fr/sts/nos_realisations_export/Documents/Fiche_Mexico_2012_en.pdf|title=Mexico City (Mexico) Lines A, B and 8 - SACEM high performance Automatic Train Control for driver-based operation|date=2015-03-05|website=Siemens SAS; Infrastructure &amp; Cities Sector; Mobility and Logistics Division|format=PDF; 600 kB|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017 the SACEM system in Paris was enhanced with [[Automatic train operation|Automatic Train Operation]] (ATO) and will be put in full operation until end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alstom.com/press-centre/2017/05/alstom-developed-automatic-train-operation-system-successfully-enters-service-on-the-rer-a/|title=Alstom-developed Automatic Train Operation system successfully enters service on the RER A|last=|first=|date=2017-10-05|website=ALSTOM Holdings|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SACEM system in Paris is to be enhanced to a fully fledged [[Communications-based train control|CBTC]] system named NExTEO. First to be deployed on the new prolongated line [[RER E]] in 2024, it is proposed to replace signalling and control on all RER lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sncf-reseau.fr/en/reportages/nexteo|title=RER E – soon one train ahead thanks to NExTEO …|date=2017-07-20|website=SNCF Réseau|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A light on the console indicates the [[speed control]] setting: an orange light means "Jog Mode", or {{convert|30|kph|mph|abbr=on}}; a red light means full stop. If the driver alters the speed, a warning buzzer may sound. If the system determines that the speed might be unsafe, and the driver does not change it within a few seconds, SACEM engages the [[Emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]]. SACEM also allows for a reduction in potential train bunching and easier recovery from delays, therefore safely increasing operating frequencies as much as possible especially during rush hour.

==Topology==
The Vienna Rectifier is a unidirectional three-phase three-switch three-level [[Pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) rectifier.  It can be seen as a three-phase [[diode bridge]] with an integrated boost converter.

==Applications==
[[Image:Vienna rectifier real.jpg|thumb|300px|Fig. 2: Top and bottom views of an air-cooled 10kW-Vienna Rectifier (400kHz PWM).]]
The Vienna Rectifier is useful wherever six-switch converters are used for achieving sinusoidal mains current and controlled output voltage, when no energy feedback from the load into the mains is available.  In practice, use of the Vienna Rectifier is advantageous when space is at a sufficient premium to justify the additional hardware cost.  These include:
* Telecommunications power supplies.
* [[Uninterruptable power supply|Uninterruptable power supplies]].
* Input stages of AC-drive converter systems.
Figure 2 shows the top and bottom views of an air-cooled 10&amp;nbsp;kW-Vienna Rectifier (400&amp;nbsp;kHz PWM), with sinusoidal input current s and controlled output voltage.  Dimensions are 250mm x 120mm x 40mm, resulting in a power density of 8.5&amp;nbsp;kW/dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  The total weight of the converter is 2.1&amp;nbsp;kg &lt;ref&gt;S. D. Round, P. Karutz, M. L. Heldwein, J. W. Kolar, “Towards a 30 kW/liter, Three-Phase Unity Power Factor Rectifier”, Proceedings of the 4th Power Conversion Conference (PCC'07), Nagoya, Japan, April 2–5, CD-ROM, {{ISBN|1-4244-0844-X}}, (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current and voltage waveforms==
[[Image:vr wave.jpg|thumb|300px|Fig 3:Time variation of voltage-phases ua, ub, uc of the current-phases ia, ib, ic.
From top to bottom: 1) mains voltages ua, ub, uc. 2) mains currents ia, ib, ic.  3) rectifier voltage at uDaM (see Fig. 1), which forms the input current. 4. Midpoint current of the output capacitors (i0 in Fig. 1).  5.  Voltage between mains midpoint M and the output voltage midpoint 0.  Note:  Inner mains inductance is not considered, and therefore the voltage across the [[filter capacitor]]s is equal to the mains voltage.]]

Figure 3 shows the system behavior, calculated using the power-electronics circuit simulator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gecko-research.com www.gecko-research.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Between the output voltage midpoint (0) and the mains midpoint (M) the common mode voltage u0M appears, as is characteristic in three-phase converter systems.

==Current control and balance of the neutral point at the DC-side==
It is possible to separately control the input current shape in each branch of the diode bridge by inserting a bidirectional switch into the node, as shown in Figure 3.  The switch Ta controls the current by controlling the magnetization of the inductor.   Switched on charges the inductor which drives the current through the bidirectional switch.  Deactivating the switch increases causes the current to bypass the switch and flow through the freewheeling diodes Da+ and Da-.  This results in a negative voltage across the inductor and drains it.  This demonstrates the ability of the topology to control the current in phase with the mains voltage ([[Power factor correction]] capability).

To generate a sinusoidal power input which is in phase with the voltage
&lt;math&gt; \underline{i}_D = G \star \underline{u}_C \approx G \star \underline{u}_1&lt;/math&gt;
the average voltage space vector over a pulse-period must satisfy:
&lt;math&gt; \underline{u}_D\star = \underline{u}-j\omega_1L_1\underline{1}_D&lt;/math&gt;
For high switching frequencies or low inductivities we require (&lt;math&gt;L1&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\underline{u}_D \star \approx \underline{u}_1&lt;/math&gt;.
The available voltage space vectors required for the input voltage are defined by the switching states(sa,sb,sc) and the direction of the phase currents.   For example, for &lt;math&gt;iDa&gt;0,iDb,iDc&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. for the phase-range&lt;math&gt; \phi_1 = -30^\circ...+30^\circ&lt;/math&gt; of the period(&lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt;) the phase of the input current space vector is &lt;math&gt;i_D \approx i_1&lt;/math&gt;).   Fig. 4 shows the conduction states of the system, and from this we get the input space vectors shows in Fig. 5 &lt;ref&gt;iPES (Interactive Power Electronics Seminar): Java-Applet Animation of the Vienna Rectifier at [http://www.ipes.ethz.ch/ipes/2002Vienna1/vr1.html www.ipes.ee.ethz.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14822">A '''virtual university''' provides [[higher education]] programs through electronic media, typically the [[Internet]]. Some are bricks-and-mortar institutions that provide online learning as part of their extended university courses while others solely offer online courses. They are regarded as a form of [[distance education]]. The goal of virtual universities is to provide access to the part of the population who would not be able to attend a physical campus, for reasons such as distance—in which students live too far from a physical campus to attend regular classes; and the need for flexibility—some students need the flexibility to study at home whenever it is convenient for them to do so.

Some of these organizations exist only as loosely tied combines of universities, institutes or departments that together provide a number of courses over the Internet, television or other media, that are separate and distinct from programs offered by the single institution outside of the combine.  Others are individual organizations with a legal framework, yet are called "virtual" because they appear only on the Internet, without a physical location aside from their administration units.  Still other virtual universities can be organized through specific or multiple physical locations, with or without actual campuses to receive program delivery through technological media that is broadcast from another location where professors give televised lectures.

Program delivery in a virtual university is administered through [[Information and communications technology]] such as web pages, e-mail and other networked sources.

As virtual universities are relatively new and vary widely, questions remain about [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] and the quality of [[Educational assessment|assessment]].

==History==

The defining characteristic of all forms and generations of distance education is the separation of student and teacher in time and space. Distance education can be seen as the precursor to online learning. Before the advent of virtual universities, many higher education institutions offered some distance education through print-based correspondence courses.  These courses were often referred to as a "course in a box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coedu.usf.edu |title=USF College of Education Home Page |publisher=Coedu.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have been developed so that students can obtain almost immediate feedback from professors and online tutors through e-mails or online discussions.

When the term "virtual" was first coined in the computational sense, it applied to things that were simulated by the computer, like [[virtual memory]].  Over time, the adjective has been applied to things that physically exist and are created or carried on by means of computers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The [[Open University]] in the [[United Kingdom]] was the world’s first successful distance teaching university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/open-change-interview-leaders-open-university |title=Open to Change: An Interview with Leaders of the Open University |publisher=[[Educause]] |date=14 March 2008 |accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded in the 1960s on the belief that communications technology could bring high quality degree-level learning to people who had not had the opportunity to attend campus universities.&lt;ref name="open.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk |title=Distance Learning Courses and Adult Education - The Open University |publisher=Open.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea for a "wireless university" was first discussed at the [[BBC]] (British Broadcasting Corporation) by the educationalist and historian J.C. Stobbart.  From these early beginnings more ideas came forth until finally the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] under the leadership of [[Harold Wilson]] formed an advisory committee to establish an Open University.

With the goal of bringing higher education to all those who wanted to access it, the committee came up with various scenarios before settling on the name ''Open University''.  The first idea floated in the UK was to have a "teleuniversity" which would combine broadcast lectures with correspondence texts and visits to conventional universities.  In the "teleuniversity" scenario courses are taught on the radio and television and in fact many universities adopted the use of this technology for their distance education courses.  The name "teleuniversity" morphed into the "University of Air" which still had the same goal of reaching the lower income groups who did not have access to higher education. The name "University of Air" did not stick and by the time the first students were admitted in January 1971 the name had become what it is today "Open University".  OU proved that it was possible to teach university-level courses to students at a distance.

By 1980, total student numbers at OU had reached 70,000 and some 6,000 people were graduating each year.  The 1980s saw increased expansion continue as more courses and subject areas were introduced; as the importance of career development grew, so the university began to offer professional training courses alongside its academic programmes. By the mid-nineties the OU was using the internet.  As of 2008, more than 180,000 students were interacting with OU online from home.

The idea of a virtual university as an institution that used computers and telecommunications instead of buildings and transport to bring students and teachers together for university courses was first published in works like "De-Schooling Society" by Ivan Illich that introduced the concept of the use of computer networks as switchboards for learning, in 1970.  In 1971 George Kasey, a media(activist)ethicist, delivered a series of lectures on "the Philosophy of Communications De-Design" under the sponsorship of Phil Jacklin PhD, professor at University of California San Jose, a member of "The (San Francisco)Bay Area Committee for Open Media and Public Access." The lectures contained the theoretical outlines for use of telecommunications and media for de-schooling and de-design of mainstream education and an alternative Virtual Free University system. By 1972 George Kasey established "Media Free Times - periodical Multimedia Random Sampling of Anarchic Communications Art" a prototype for remote learning with the use of "multi-media periodicals," that are now commonly referred to as "web pages". In 1995 by John Tiffin and Lalita Rajasingham in their book "In Search Of the Virtual Class: Education in an Information Society" (London and New York, Routledge). It was based on a joint research project at Victoria University of Wellington that ran from 1986-1996. Called the virtual class laboratory it used dedicated telecommunication systems to make it possible for students to attend class virtually or physically and was at first supported by a number of telecommunication organisations. Its purpose was to seek the critical factors in using ICT for university level education. In 1992 the virtual class lab moved onto the Internet.

A number of other universities were involved in the late eighties in pioneering initiatives and experiments were conducted between Victoria University in New Zealand, the University of Hawaii, Ohio State University and Waseda University to try and conduct classes and courses at an international level via telecommunications. This led to the concept of a Global Virtual University.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffin and Rajasingham (2003)''The Global Virtual University'' London and New York, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coursework==
Providing access to higher education for all students, especially adult learners, is made easier by the fact that most virtual universities have no entry requirements for their undergraduate courses.&lt;ref name="open.ac.uk"/&gt;  Entry requirements are needed for the courses that are aimed at postgraduates or those who work in specific jobs.

Studying in a virtual university has essential differences from studying in a [[Brick and mortar business|brick and mortar]] university.  There are no buildings and no campus to go to because students receive learning materials over the Internet.  In most cases, only a [[personal computer]] and an Internet connection is needed—even for learning laboratory experiments and technical materials, such as robotics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =  O. Goldstain, I. Ben-Gal, Y. Bukchin(2007|format = PDF|title = Remote learning for the manipulation and control of robotic cells |url = http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/Remote_Learning.pdf|publisher = European Journal of Engineering Education 32 (4), 481-494, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; that traditionally required physical presence of students in the classroom. Course materials can include printed material, books, audio and video cassettes, TV programmes, CD-ROM/software, and web sites.  Support is offered to learners from the professor or a tutor online through e-mails if they are having problems with the course.

Taking courses on-line means that students will be learning in their own time by reading course material, working on course activities, writing assignments and perhaps working with other students through interactive [[teleconference]]s.  Online learning can be an isolating experience since the student spends the majority of their time working by themselves.  Some learners do not mind this kind of solo learning, but others find it a major stumbling block to successful completion of courses.  Because of the potential difficulty of maintaining the schedule needed to be successful when learning online, some virtual universities apply the same type of time management as traditional schools.  Many courses operate to a timetable, which the student receives with the course materials.  These may include the planned activities for each week of the course and due dates for the assignments.  If the course has an exam, the students will be informed where they have to go to write it.

An example of a university that maintains a tight schedule is the [[Virtual Global University]] (VGU) in Germany.  VGU offers a graduate program "International Master of Business Informatics" (MBI)—a master program in information technology and management that takes an average of four semesters to complete (for full-time students). Each course has a lecture or a virtual class meeting every week. Afterwards, students get a homework assignment; for example, they have to solve an exercise, elaborate on some problem, discuss a case study, or take a test. Lecturers give them immediate feedback, and one week later, the same happens again.

Coursework can be same for a Virtual University as the On-campus University in certain cases. [[NYU Tandon Online]], for example, provides the same course work to its online students as the on-campus students at the [[New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering|NYU Tandon School of Engineering]]. This is done using advanced technologies.

==Teaching modes==

When online courses first began, the primary mode of delivery was through a two way [[audio-visual]] network. Then as well as now, many of the virtual study programs were mainly based on text documents, but [[multimedia]] technologies have become increasingly popular as well.  These web-based delivery modes are used in order to expand access to programs and services that can be offered anytime and anywhere.  The spectrum of teaching modes in virtual education includes courses based on [[hypertext]], videos, audios, e-mails, and video conferencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanford|first1=Michael Ellis|last2=Peters|first2=Sophia|title=On Teaching Modalities Of Virtual Universities &amp; Online Course Providers|url=http://takemyonlineclass.us/taking-online-courses-modalities-universities/|publisher=Class Consultants|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching on the web through courseware such as [[WebCT]] and [[Blackboard Inc.|Blackboard]] are also used. See [[Virtual education]].

== Quality ==
Students taking "virtual" courses are doing real work to get their degrees, and educators preparing and teaching those courses spend real time in doing so.  That is, students meet a comparable level of academic learning outcomes and are evaluated through programs constructed according to standard university-level criteria.{{Clarify|reason=Can it be asserted that this applies to all virtual universities?|date=October 2010}}  Though it should not be assumed, virtual universities may be accredited in the same way as traditional universities and operate according to a similar set of academic standards.

However, questions remain about accreditation and the quality of assessment. Accreditation is required to assure students that the online institute has certified online instructors who have the expertise and educational qualifications to design and carry out the curriculum. Assessment standards need to be particularly closely monitored in virtual universities. For example, respondents in studies of opinions about online degrees will rate an online degree from Stanford the same as an on-campus degree, because the name of the granting institution is recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineuc.net/oucarticle.html |title=News |publisher=Online UC |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
