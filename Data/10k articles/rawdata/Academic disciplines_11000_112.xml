'''Aggressionism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] that the only real [[philosophy of war|cause of war]] is human aggressiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Alexander Moseley |title=A Philosophy of War |publisher=Algora Publishing |page=78 |date=2002 |isbn=978-1-892941-94-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has dominated much [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary thought]] about [[human nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Signe Howell|authorlink=Signe Howell |author2=Roy G. Willis |title=Societies at Peace: Anthropological Perspectives |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=1989 |page=188 |isbn=978-0-415-01825-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;Nonetheless, many [[Evolutionary biologist|evolutionary biologists]] discount aggressionism as it promotes [[human extinction]] through [[war]]. However, the concept of aggressionism cannot be described as its own word, as it branches off the [[root word]] "[[aggression]]." The definition being "the action of a state in violating by force the rights of another state, particularly its territorial rights; an unprovoked offensive, attack, invasion, or the like..." or a "hostile or destructive mental attitude or behavior" which leads to conflict and eventually, [[wikt:bloodshed|bloodshed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Human Prehistory in Fiction |author=Charles De Paolo |publisher=McFarland |date=2003 |page=87 |isbn=978-0-7864-1417-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this particular [[concept]], [[aggression]] occurs in all [[species]] as a form of [[Parental care|protection of their own]] or of their [[Territory (animal)|territory]] in order to keep their young safe. However, though most species protect against their predators, some also protect from their own. For example, lions are very territorial and fight other grown, male lions to keep their status as the alpha. Similar to humans, if an invader attacks, human [[instinct]] leads them to defend oneself and fend them off. When necessary, for the sake of [[Survival of the fittest|survival]], most species become aggressive to get food to survive. Yet, aggressionism isn't the same as aggression. Aggressionism is the concept of aggression particularly made for humans, as it is more complex than simply wanting to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Georgiev|first=Alexander V.|last2=Klimczuk|first2=Amanda C. E.|last3=Traficonte|first3=Daniel M.|last4=Maestripieri|first4=Dario|date=2013-07-18|title=When Violence Pays: A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Aggressive Behavior in Animals and Humans| journal=Evolutionary Psychology : An International Journal of Evolutionary Approaches to Psychology and Behavior|volume=11|issue=3|pages=678–699 |pmc=3859192|pmid=23864299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressionism specifies [[human nature]] in its [[Hostility|hostile]] form when [[Ideology|ideologies]] of multiple humans do not coincide with each other. However, the form of hostility that humans convey isn't direct in terms of [[Street fighting|street fights]]. This form of aggression directs humans in a composed manner between the leaders of [[Nation|nations]] or [[Organization|organizations]] in which leads to war. In this [[Point of view (philosophy)|perspective]], the hostility is contained due to the persons having [[respect]] in each other. Rather than being savage like animals, humans use their [[intellect]] to defeat their opponent in war—therefore, placing [[pride]], [[greed]], and [[belief]] in their own [[skill]] to lead their nation to victory. Before a war starts, there is always disagreement between the leaders. Never is there a leader raging at the other. Calmly, they would always say that it is unfortunate that the two nations disagree and would go back to their respective countries to declare war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-14|title=Declaration of war|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Declaration_of_war&amp;oldid=836342914|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause of War ==
Although it has been directly stated, that aggressionism is a philosophy theory that humans are the cause of war, there are more direct reasons for conflicts to escalate to war. Aggressionism is a theory that describes complex behavior of human nature that involves strong beliefs in one's own ideology. It is a description of people who cannot see the views of others and would only see their own as the only right one in the world. Throughout history, there have been a number of people who were like this and had caused war.[[File:Adolf Hitler cropped restored.jpg|thumb|Adolf Hitler|174x174px]]

=== Examples of Political Leaders Who Displayed Aggressionism ===
[[Adolf Hitler]] is a primary example of a person who displayed aggressionism. In his time of [[reign]], he installed a government that practiced [[fascism]] which is a form of [[statism]]. This type of government is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism. This type of nation is ruled by [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]] power with overwhelming control over all the aspects of the country including the [[economy]], [[society]], and its beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-31|title=Fascism|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fascism&amp;oldid=833412262|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler had a strong belief that the [[Jews|Jewish]] were in fact, the cause of Germany's loss in [[World War I|WWI]] causing his ideology to circulate around a hate for the Jewish people. Therefore, his aggressionism had started to take form in war through the initial [[invasion of Poland]].

[[File:Joseph Stalin, 1912.jpg|thumb|Joseph Stalin|180x180px]]

[[Joseph Stalin]] is another example that also displayed aggressionism. However, Stalin's aggressionism instead was more subtle than Hitler's. Stalin believed that with his dictatorial power, he would be able to bring Russia in its time out of its [[Famines in Russia and the USSR|famine]] and spread his ideology of communism towards the rest of the world. During Stalin's reign, he transformed Russia to "an industrial and military superpower." He had created programs to boost the food supply and boost its economy, however this had killed millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/joseph-stalin|title=Joseph Stalin - Facts &amp; Summary - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II|WWII]], the Soviet Union and the US had become superpowers and tension grew between these countries which started the [[Cold War]]. To gain advantage over the other, Stalin attempted to spread [[communism]] towards other states, countries, and nations. Thus, the subtle aggressionism. Unlike Hitler, he had helped spread his ideologies to other leaders, including China's [[Mao Zedong]].

== Source of Aggressionism ==
In both of the examples of aggressionism, there are basic natures of human beings that cause their ideologies to take form. With Hitler, he had displayed his overwhelming hate for the Jewish due to his nationalism for Germany. One of the more basic forms of emotion is hate, which was the source of his aggression towards the millions of Jewish who were killed during the Holocaust. The cause of war was due to his inhumane actions towards a specific group of people. Therefore, his unreasonable action for killing people, thinking that he has the right to do so, is one of the most lethal forms of aggression. For Stalin, he had created a country through is dictatorship with the ideology of communism. He had aggressed his beliefs upon his own people with his plans of creating a country that would be seen as a military superpower. He had caused many to die with the famine and plan to boost agriculture. However, the source for this action was due to the fact that he believed in his ideology of [[Marxism]]/[[Leninism]].

'''Animal identification''' using a means of marking is a process done to identify and track specific [[animal]]s. It is done for a variety of reasons including verification of ownership, [[biosecurity]] control, and tracking for research or agricultural purposes.

==History==

Individual identification of animals by means of body markings has been practiced for over 3,800 years, as stated in [[Code of Hammurabi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;!-- Keep this note! Technical term, necessary for Wikipedia articles; don't assign for wiktionary
--&gt;
The term '''arithmetic underflow''' (or "[[floating point]] underflow", or just "underflow") is a condition in a computer program where the result of a calculation is a number of smaller absolute value than the computer can actually represent in memory on its CPU.

Arithmetic underflow can occur when the true result of a floating point operation is smaller in [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] (that is, closer to zero) than the smallest value representable as a [[normal number (computing)|normal]] floating point number in the target datatype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coonen|first1=Jerome T|title=An implementation guide to a proposed standard for floating-point arithmetic|journal=Computer|date=1980|volume=13|issue=1|pages=68–79|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8b13/26cd9b6411cbf1ffc325e0c48afbd0d29f24.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underflow can in part be regarded as negative [[Arithmetic overflow|overflow]] of the [[exponent]] of the floating point value.
For example, if the exponent part can represent values from &amp;minus;128 to 127, then a result with a value less than &amp;minus;128 may cause underflow.

Note that storing values that are too low in an integer variable (e.g. attempting to store -1 in an unsigned integer) is properly referred to as [[integer overflow]], or more broadly "integer wraparound". The term underflow normally refers to floating point numbers only, and is a separate issue. It is not possible in most floating-point designs to store a too-low value, as usually they are signed and have a negative infinity value.

==Underflow gap==
The interval between &amp;minus;''fminN'' and ''fminN'', where
''fminN'' is the smallest positive normal floating point value, is called the underflow gap.
This is because the size of this interval is many orders of magnitude larger than the distance between
adjacent normal floating point values just outside the gap. For instance, if the floating
point datatype can represent 20 binary digits, the underflow gap is 2&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; times
larger than the absolute distance between adjacent floating point values just outside the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sun Microsystems|title=Numerical Computation Guide|date=2005|publisher=Oracle|url=https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19422-01/819-3693/|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In older designs, the underflow gap had just one usable value, zero. When an underflow occurred,
the true result was replaced by zero (either directly by the hardware, or by system software
handling the primary underflow condition). This replacement is called ''flush to zero''.

The 1984 edition of [[IEEE 754]] introduced [[subnormal numbers]]. The subnormal numbers (including zero) fill the
underflow gap with values where the absolute distance between adjacent values is the same as
for adjacent values just outside the underflow gap. This enables ''gradual underflow'' where
a nearest subnormal value is used, just as a nearest normal value is used when possible.
Even when using gradual underflow, the nearest value may be zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demmel|first1=James|title=Underflow and the Reliability of Numerical Software|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing|date=1984|volume=5|issue=4|pages=887–919|doi=10.1137/0905062|url=https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0905062|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absolute distance between adjacent floating point values just outside the gap is called the machine epsilon. The [[machine epsilon]] is typically characterized by the largest value whose sum with the value 1 will result in the answer with value 1 in that floating point scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heath|first1=Michael T.|title=Scientific Computing|date=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-239910-4|page=20|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be written as &lt;math&gt;fl(1+\epsilon) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;fl()&lt;/math&gt; is a function which converts the real value into the floating point representation. While the machine epsilon is not to be confused with the underflow level (assuming subnormal numbers), it is closely related. The machine epsilon is dependent on the number of bits which make up the [[significand]], whereas the underflow level depends on the number of digits which make up the exponent field. In most floating point systems, the underflow level is smaller than the machine epsilon.

==Handling of underflow==
The occurrence of an underflow may set a ('sticky') status bit, raise an exception, at the hardware
level generate an interrupt, or may cause some combination of these effects.

As specified in [[IEEE 754]], the underflow condition is only signaled if there is also a loss of precision.
Typically this is determined as the final result being inexact.
However, if the user is [[trap (computing)|trapping]] on underflow,
this may happen regardless of consideration for loss of precision.
The default handling in IEEE 754 for underflow (as well as other exceptions) is to record
as a floating point status that underflow has occurred. This is specified for the application
programming level, but often also interpreted as how to handle it at the hardware level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">'''Censorship of student media''' pertains to the suppression of free speech by school administrative bodies of student-run news operations. Typically this involves interfering with the operation and final publishing authority of a [[school newspaper]], radio, television or other electronic online content generated by students. 

While this has typically consisted of schools enforcing their authority to control the funding and distribution of publications, sometimes forms of censorship extend to expression not funded by or under the official auspices of the school system or college (for example, confiscating independently produced "underground" publications or imposing discipline for material posted on off-campus websites).

==United States==
The states of Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts and Oregon have all passed legislation fortifying student journalists' right to free expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Student Press Law Center |url=http://www.splc.org/knowyourrights/law_library.asp |title=Student Press Law center - Law Library |publisher=SPLC |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The nonprofit [[Student Press Law Center]] tracks and provides pro-bono legal aid to student-run media organizations in the U.S.

Some notable cases in the [[United States]] include:
* [[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier]],1988- A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision that held that public school curricular student newspapers that have not been established as forums for student expression are subject to a lower level of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protection than independent student expression or newspapers established (by policy or practice) as forums for student expression. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1987/86-836&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chiller.jpg|thumb|right|[[York International]] water-cooled chiller]]
A '''chiller''' is a machine that removes heat from a liquid via a [[vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression]] or [[absorption refrigerator|absorption refrigeration cycle]]. This liquid can then be circulated through a [[heat exchanger]] to cool equipment, or another process stream (such as air or process water). As a necessary by product, refrigeration creates [[waste heat]] that must be exhausted to ambience, or for greater efficiency, recovered for heating purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Chilled water is used to [[Air conditioning|cool and dehumidify]] air in mid- to large-size commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities. Water chillers can be water-cooled, air-cooled, or evaporatively cooled. Water-cooled systems can provide efficiency and [[Environmental issue|environmental impact]] advantages over air-cooled systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPDRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=water+chiller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA8u6Q0v7QAhUlw4MKHdU-BxQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=water%20chiller&amp;f=false|title=HVAC Water Chillers and Cooling Towers: Fundamentals, Application, and Operation, Second Edition|last=III|first=Herbert W.

==Use in air conditioning==
[[File:Air Cooled Liquid Chiller.jpg|thumb|A liquid (glycol based) chiller with an air cooled condenser on the rooftop of a medium size commercial building.]]
In [[air conditioning]] systems, chilled water is typically distributed to heat exchangers, or '''coils''', in [[air handler]]s or other types of terminal devices which cool the air in their respective space(s). The water is then recirculated to the chiller to be recooled. These cooling coils transfer [[sensible heat]] and [[latent heat]] from the air to the chilled water, thus cooling and usually dehumidifying the air stream. A typical chiller for air conditioning applications is rated between 15 and 2000 [[Ton of refrigeration|tons]], and at least one manufacturer can produce chillers capable of up to 5,200 tons of cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TITAN Multistage Industrial Chillers (FORM 160.72-EG1)|publisher=York International|url=http://www.usair-eng.com/chillers/OMtitan.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilled water temperatures can range from {{convert|35|to|45|F|C}}, depending upon application requirements.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers {{cite web |url=http://www.ashrae.org/publications/page/158 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162917/http://ashrae.org/publications/page/158 |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the chillers for air conditioning systems are not operable or they are in need of repair or replacement, emergency chillers may be used to supply chilled water. Rental chillers are mounted on a [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]] so that they can be quickly deployed to the site. Large chilled water [[hose]]s are used to connect between rental chillers and air conditioning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Request for Proposal #946 - Emergency Chillers Rentals|publisher=Montclair State University|url=http://www.montclair.edu/news/media/originals/Ad_Bid_946.pdf|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in industry==
In industrial application, chilled water or other liquid from the chiller is pumped through process or laboratory equipment.  Industrial chillers are used for controlled cooling of products, mechanisms and factory machinery in a wide range of industries.  They are often used in the plastic industries, injection and blow molding, metal working cutting oils, welding equipment, [[die-casting]] and machine tooling, chemical processing, pharmaceutical formulation, food and beverage processing, paper and cement processing, vacuum systems, X-ray diffraction, power supplies and power generation stations, analytical equipment, semiconductors, compressed air and gas cooling. They are also used to cool high-heat specialized items such as MRI machines and lasers, and in hospitals, hotels and campuses.

Chillers for industrial applications can be centralized, where a single chiller serves multiple cooling needs, or decentralized where each application or machine has its own chiller. Each approach has its advantages. It is also possible to have a combination of both centralized and decentralized chillers, especially if the cooling requirements are the same for some applications or points of use, but not all.

Decentralized chillers are usually small in size and cooling capacity, usually from {{convert|0.2|to|10|ST|LT t|3}}.  Centralized chillers generally have capacities ranging from ten tons to hundreds or thousands of tons.

Chilled water is used to [[Air conditioning|cool and dehumidify]] air in mid- to large-size commercial, industrial, and institutional (CII) facilities.  Water chillers can be water-cooled, air-cooled, or evaporatively cooled. Water-cooled chillers incorporate the use of [[cooling tower]]s which improve the chillers' thermodynamic effectiveness as compared to air-cooled chillers. This is due to heat rejection at or near the air's wet-bulb temperature rather than the higher, sometimes much higher, dry-bulb temperature. Evaporatively cooled chillers offer higher efficiencies than air-cooled chillers but lower than water-cooled chillers.

Water-cooled chillers are typically intended for indoor installation and operation, and are cooled by a separate condenser water loop and connected to outdoor cooling towers to expel heat to the atmosphere.

Air-cooled and evaporative cooled chillers are intended for outdoor installation and operation. Air-cooled machines are directly cooled by ambient air being mechanically circulated directly through the machine's condenser coil to expel heat to the atmosphere. Evaporative cooled machines are similar, except they implement a mist of water over the condenser coil to aid in condenser cooling, making the machine more efficient than a traditional air-cooled machine. No remote cooling tower is typically required with either of these types of packaged air-cooled or evaporatively cooled chillers.

Where available, cold water readily available in nearby water bodies might be used directly for cooling, replace or supplement cooling towers. The [[deep water source cooling]] system in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], is an example. It uses cold lake water to cool the chillers, which in turn are used to cool city buildings via a [[district cooling]] system. The return water is used to warm the city's drinking water supply, which is desirable in this cold climate. Whenever a chiller's heat rejection can be used for a productive purpose, in addition to the cooling function, very high thermal effectiveness is possible.

==Vapor-compression chiller technology==
A vapor compression chiller typically uses one of four types of compressor: [[Reciprocating compressor|Reciprocating]] compression, [[scroll compressor|scroll]] compression, [[rotary screw compressor|screw-driven]] compression, and [[centrifugal compressor|centrifugal]] compression are all mechanical machines that can be powered by [[electric motors]], [[steam turbine|steam]], or [[gas turbine]]s. They produce their cooling effect via the [[reverse-Rankine cycle]], also known as vapor-compression. With [[evaporative cooling]] heat rejection, their coefficients of performance (COPs) are very high; typically 4.0 or more.

::COP &lt;math&gt; = \frac{\text{Cooling power}}{\text{Input power}} &lt;/math&gt;

Current vapor-compression chiller technology is based on the "reverse-Rankine" cycle known as vapor-compression.
See the attached diagram which outlines the key components of the chiller system.
[[File:Water Cooled Chiller Diagram.png|thumb|Diagram showing the components of a water-cooled chiller]]
Key components of the chiller:

Refrigeration compressors are essentially a pump for refrigerant gas. The capacity of the compressor,
and hence the chiller cooling capacity, is measured in kilowatts input (kW), Horse power input (HP), or
volumetric flow (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h, ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h). The mechanism for compressing refrigerant gas differs between
compressors, and each has its own application. Common refrigeration compressors include
reciprocating, scroll, screw, or centrifugal. These can be powered by electric motors, steam turbines, or
gas turbines. Compressors can have an integrated motor from a specific manufacturer, or be open drive--allowing the connection to another type of mechanical connection. Compressors can also be either
Hermetic (welded closed) or semihermetic (bolted together).

In recent years, application of variable-speed drive (VSD) technology has increased efficiencies of vapor
compression chillers. The first VSD was applied to centrifugal compressor chillers in the late 1970s and
has become the norm as the cost of energy has increased. Now, VSDs are being applied to rotary screw
and scroll-technology compressors.

Condensers can be air-cooled, water-cooled, or evaporative. The condenser is a heat exchanger which
allows heat to migrate from the refrigerant gas to either water or air. Air cooled condenser are
manufactured from copper tubes (for the refrigerant flow) and aluminium fins (for the air flow). Each
condenser has a different material cost and they vary in terms of efficiency. With evaporative cooling
condensers, their coefficients-of-performance (COPs) are very high; typically 4.0 or more.

The expansion device or refrigerant metering device (RMD) restricts the flow of the liquid refrigerant
causing a pressure drop that vaporizes some of the refrigerant; this vaporization absorbs heat from nearby liquid refrigerant.
The RMD is located immediately prior to the evaporator so that the cold gas in the evaporator can absorb
heat from the water in the evaporator. There is a sensor for the RMD on the evaporator outlet side which
allows the RMD to regulate the refrigerant flow based on the chiller design requirement.

Evaporators can be plate type or shell and tube type. The evaporator is a heat exchanger which allows
the heat energy to migrate from the water stream into the refrigerant gas. During the state change of the remaining
liquid to gas, the refrigerant can absorb large amounts of heat without changing temperature.

==How absorption technology works==
The thermodynamic cycle of an [[absorption chiller]] is driven by a heat source; this heat is usually delivered to the chiller via steam, hot water, or combustion. Compared to electrically powered chillers, an absorption chiller has very low electrical power requirements - very rarely above 15&amp;nbsp;kW combined consumption for both the solution pump and the refrigerant pump.  However, its heat input requirements are large, and its COP is often 0.5 (single-effect) to 1.0 (double-effect). For the same tonnage capacity, an absorption chiller requires a much larger [[cooling tower]] than a vapor-compression chiller.  However, absorption chillers, from an energy-efficiency point of view, excel where cheap, low-grade heat or waste heat is readily available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eng.usf.edu/~hchen4/Cogeneration.htm|title=Converting Low-Grade Heat into Electrical Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In extremely sunny climates, [[solar energy]] has been used to operate [http://www.thermocold-hvacsystems.co.uk/absorption-chillers/ absorption chillers].

The single-effect absorption cycle uses water as the refrigerant and [[lithium bromide]] as the absorbent. It is the strong affinity that these two substances have for one another that makes the cycle work. The entire process occurs in almost a complete vacuum.

#'''Solution Pump''' : A dilute lithium bromide solution (63% concentration) is collected in the bottom of the absorber shell. From here, a hermetic solution pump moves the solution through a shell and tube heat exchanger for preheating.
#'''Generator''' : After exiting the heat exchanger, the dilute solution moves into the upper shell. The solution surrounds a bundle of tubes which carries either steam or hot water. The steam or hot water transfers heat into the pool of dilute lithium bromide solution. The solution boils, sending refrigerant vapor upward into the condenser and leaving behind concentrated lithium bromide. The concentrated lithium bromide solution moves down to the heat exchanger, where it is cooled by the weak solution being pumped up to the generator.
#'''Condenser''' : The refrigerant vapor migrates through mist eliminators to the condenser tube bundle. The refrigerant vapor condenses on the tubes. The heat is removed by the cooling water which moves through the inside of the tubes. As the refrigerant condenses, it collects in a trough at the bottom of the condenser.
#'''Evaporator''' : The refrigerant liquid moves from the condenser in the upper shell down to the evaporator in the lower shell and is sprayed over the evaporator tube bundle. Due to the extreme vacuum of the lower shell [6&amp;nbsp;mm Hg (0.8 kPa) absolute pressure], the refrigerant liquid boils at approximately {{convert|39|F|C}}, creating the refrigerant effect. (This vacuum is created by hygroscopic action - the strong affinity lithium bromide has for water - in the Absorber directly below.)
#'''Absorber''' : As the refrigerant vapor migrates to the absorber from the evaporator, the strong lithium bromide solution from the generator is sprayed over the top of the absorber tube bundle. The strong lithium bromide solution actually pulls the refrigerant vapor into solution, creating the extreme vacuum in the evaporator. The absorption of the refrigerant vapor into the lithium bromide solution also generates heat which is removed by the cooling water.  Now the dilute lithium bromide solution collects in the bottom of the lower shell, where it flows down to the solution pump. The chilling cycle is now completed and the process begins once again.&lt;ref name="matsu1"&gt;http://matsu.com.au/chiller-range/chiller-range-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial chiller technology===
Industrial chillers typically come as complete, packaged, closed-loop systems, including the chiller unit, [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], and pump station with recirculating pump, expansion valve, no-flow shutdown, internal cold water control. The internal tank helps maintain cold water temperature and prevents temperature spikes from occurring. Closed-loop industrial chillers recirculate a clean coolant or clean water with condition additives at a constant temperature and pressure to increase the stability and reproducibility of water-cooled machines and instruments. The water flows from the chiller to the application's point of use and back.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

If the water temperature differentials between inlet and outlet are high, then a large external water tank would be used to store the cold water. In this case the chilled water is not going directly from the chiller to the application, but goes to the external water tank which acts as a sort of "temperature buffer." The cold water tank is much larger than the internal water goes from the external tank to the application and the return hot water from the application goes back to the external tank, not to the chiller.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The less common open loop industrial chillers control the temperature of a liquid in an open tank or sump by constantly recirculating it. The liquid is drawn from the tank, pumped through the chiller and back to the tank. In industrial water chillers is the use of water cooling instead of air cooling. In this case the condenser does not cool the hot refrigerant with ambient air, but uses water that is cooled by a [[cooling tower]]. This development allows a reduction in energy requirements by more than 15% and also allows a significant reduction in the size of the chiller, due to the small surface area of the water-based condenser and the absence of fans. Additionally, the absence of fans allows for significantly reduced noise levels.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Most industrial chillers use refrigeration as the media for cooling, but some rely on simpler techniques such as air or water flowing over coils containing the coolant to regulate temperature.  Water is the most commonly used coolant within process chillers, although coolant mixtures (mostly water with a coolant additive to enhance heat dissipation) are frequently employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPDRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=water+chiller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA8u6Q0v7QAhUlw4MKHdU-BxQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q==%20additive&amp;f=false|title=HVAC Water Chillers and Cooling Towers: Fundamentals, Application, and Operation, Second Edition|last=III|first=Herbert W. Stanford|date=2016-04-19|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781439862117|location=|page=113|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial chiller selection==
Important specifications to consider when searching for cumond industrial chillers include the total life cycle cost, the power source, chiller IP rating, chiller cooling capacity, evaporator capacity, evaporator material, evaporator type, condenser material, condenser capacity, ambient temperature, motor fan type, noise level, internal piping materials, number of compressors, type of compressor, number of fridge circuits, coolant requirements, fluid discharge temperature, and COP (the ratio between the cooling capacity in RT to the energy consumed by the whole chiller in KW). For medium to large chillers this should range from 3.5 to 7.0, with higher values meaning higher efficiency.  Chiller efficiency is often specified in kilowatts per [[Air conditioning#Energy|refrigeration ton]] (kW/RT).

Process pump specifications that are important to consider include the process flow, process pressure, pump material, elastomer and mechanical shaft seal material, motor voltage, motor electrical class, motor IP rating and pump rating. If the cold water temperature is lower than −5&amp;nbsp;°C, then a special pump needs to be used to be able to pump the high concentrations of ethylene glycol. Other important specifications include the internal water tank size and materials and full load current.

Control panel features that should be considered when selecting between industrial chillers include the local control panel, remote control panel, fault indicators, temperature indicators, and pressure indicators.

Additional features include emergency alarms, hot gas bypass, city water switchover, and casters.&lt;ref name="matsu1"/&gt;

Demountable chillers are also an option for deployment in remote areas and where the conditions may be hot and dusty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matsu.com.au/mining|title=Summit Matsu Chillers - Chillers for Mining  - Summit Matsu Chillers|work=Summit Matsu Chillers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refrigerants==
{{Main article|Refrigerant}}

A vapor-compression chiller uses a [[refrigerant]] internally as its working fluid.  Many refrigerants options are available; when selecting a chiller, the application cooling temperature requirements and refrigerant's cooling characteristics need to be matched.  Important parameters to consider are the operating temperatures and pressures.

There are several environmental factors that concern refrigerants, and also affect the future availability for chiller applications.  This is a key consideration in intermittent applications where a large chiller may last for 25 years or more. [[Ozone depletion potential]] (ODP) and [[global warming potential]] (GWP) of the refrigerant need to be considered. ODP and GWP data for some of the more common vapor-compression refrigerants (noting that many of these refrigerants are highly flammable and/or toxic):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Comparative law''' is the study of differences and similarities between the [[law]] ([[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]) of different countries. More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal "systems" (or "families") in existence in the world, including the [[common law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], [[Canon law]], [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Hindu law]], and [[Chinese law]]. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, [[economic globalization]], and democratization.

==History==
The origins of modern Comparative Law can be traced back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1667 in his Latin-language book Nova Methodus Discendae Docendaeque Iurisprudentiae (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence).  Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. Notably, a few years earlier, Leibnitz introduced an idea of Language families.

Although every Legal System is unique, Comparative Law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of Legal Systems, wherein Law Families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between Law Families are found in the source(s) of Law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the Legal System. [[Montesquieu]] is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Laws|author=Baron De Montesquieu|place=New York |publisher=Hafner |year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|[T]he political and civil laws of each nation ... should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another.

They should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government: whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.

They should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.}}

Also, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that "to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety." Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:

[[Image:HSMaine.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Sir [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], British jurist and first professor of comparative law at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].]]
{{quote|As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.}}

The modern founding figure of comparative and [[legal anthropology|anthropological]] jurisprudence was Sir [[Henry Maine]], a British jurist and legal historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEk-Fpdw4MYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sir Henry Maine: A Study in Victorian Jurisprudence|author=Raymond Cocks|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1861 work ''[[Ancient Law|Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas]]'', he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of [[Far East|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|West]]ern legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.

The first university course on the subject was established at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358681/Sir-Henry-Maine|title=Sir Henry Maine|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, [[Rudolf Schlesinger]]. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at [[Cornell Law School]] helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.

==Purpose==
Comparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kristoffel Grechenig &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360''] comparing German style and U.S. style legal scholarship&lt;/ref&gt; and how their elements combine into a system.

Several disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative [[constitutional law]], comparative [[administrative law]], comparative [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] (in the sense of the law of [[tort]]s, [[delict]]s, [[contract]]s and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), comparative [[commercial law]] (in the sense of [[Companies law|business organisations]] and trade), and comparative [[criminal law]]. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:
* To attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect
* To perfect the legal systems in effect
* Possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the [[UNIDROIT]] initiative)

==Relationship with other legal subjects==
Comparative law is different from the fields of general [[jurisprudence]] (legal theory), [[international law]], including both [[public international law]] and [[private international law]] (also known as [[conflict of laws]]).

Despite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the [[United Nations System]], in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of [[legal transplants]], i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of [[legal transplants]] was coined by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.

Also, the usefulness of comparative law for [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]] (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law &amp; economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: 
* How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? 
* Are legal rules comparable? 
* How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?

==Classifications of legal systems==

===Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff===
Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff&lt;ref&gt;''Traité de droit comparé'' – in French; Paris 1950–1952&lt;/ref&gt; believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems ''per se'' get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the

* [[Law of France|French group]], under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic ''code civil'']] of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, [[Louisiana]], various South American states such as Brazil, [[Quebec]], [[Saint Lucia]], the [[Ionian Islands]], Egypt, and [[Lebanon]]
* [[Law of Germany|German group]]
* Scandinavian group, comprising the laws of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland
* [[Common law|English group]], including, ''inter alia'', England, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
* Russian group
* [[Sharia|Islamic group]] (used in the [[Muslim world]])
* [[Hindu law|Hindu group]]

===David===
[[René David]]&lt;ref&gt;''Traité élémentaire de droit civil comparé: Introduction à l'étude des droits étrangers et à la méthode comparative'' - in French; Paris, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:
* [[Western world|Western]] Laws, a group subdivided into the:
** [[Romano-Germanic law|Romano-Germanic subgroup]] (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to [[Roman Law]] – see [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]])
** [[Common law|Anglo-Saxon subgroup]]
* [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet Law]]
* [[Sharia|Muslim Law]]
* [[Hindu law|Hindu Law]]
* [[Chinese law|Chinese Law]]
* [[Jewish Law]]
Especially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are
* liberal democracy
* capitalist economy
* Christian religion

===Zweigert and Kötz===
Konrad Zweigert and [[Hein Kötz]] propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''An Introduction to Comparative Law'', translation from the German original: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung auf dem Gebiete des Privatrechts'' by Tony Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998. {{ISBN|9780198268598}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman law|Roman family]]
* [[Law of Germany|German family]]
* [[Common law|Common law family]]
* Nordic family
* Family of the laws of the [[Far East]] (China and Japan)
* Religious family (Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu law)

Up to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and Kötz also used to mention [[Socialist law|Soviet or socialist law]] as another family of laws.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung''. 3rd edition. 1996. Mohr Siebeck. Tübingen. 1996. {{ISBN|3-16-146548-2}} (Hein Kötz mentions in the preface to the third edition on page&amp;nbsp;V that the fall of "soviet communism" also made an end to the "soviet family of laws", which made it possible to save some 60&amp;nbsp;pages as compared to the 2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Complex systems biology''' ('''CSB''') is a branch or subfield of [[mathematical and theoretical biology]] concerned with [[complexity]] of both structure and function in biological organisms, as well as the emergence and evolution of organisms and species, with emphasis  being placed on the [[interconnectivity|complex interactions]] of, and within, [[Biological network inference|bionetworks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sprites, P |author2=Glymour, C |author3=Scheines, R |year=2000 |title= Causation, Prediction, and Search: Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning |edition=2nd |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the fundamental relations and [[Relational algebra|relational patterns]] that are essential to life.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Snooks, Graeme, "A general theory of complex living systems: Exploring the demand side of dynamics", ''Complexity'', vol. 13, no. 6, July/August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonner"&gt;Bonner, J.

==Complexity of organisms and biosphere==
A complete definition of [[complexity]] for individual organisms, species, ecosystems, biological evolution and the biosphere has eluded researchers, and still is an ongoing issue.&lt;ref name="Bonner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heylighen, Francis (2008). "Complexity and Self-Organization". In Bates, Marcia J.; Maack, Mary Niles. Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences. CRC. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-9712-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Seawifs global biosphere.jpg|thumb|right]]

Most [[complex system]] models are often formulated in terms of concepts drawn from statistical physics, information theory and non-linear dynamics; however, such approaches are not focused on, or do not include,  the conceptual part of complexity related to organization and topological attributes or algebraic topology, such as network connectivity of genomes, interactomes and biological organisms that are very important.&lt;ref name="Rosen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;^ Heylighen, Francis (2008).

Retrieved 2010-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the two complementary approaches based both on [[information theory]], [[network topology]]/[[graph theory|abstract graph theory]] concepts are being combined for example in the fields of [[neuroscience]] and [[cognition|human cognition]].&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hdl.handle.net/10101/npre.2011.6115.1 Wallace, Rodrick. When Spandrels Become Arches: Neural crosstalk and the evolution of consciousness. Available from Nature Precedings  (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally agreed that there is a [[hierarchy]] of complexity levels of organization that should be considered as distinct from that of the levels of reality in [[ontology]].&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poli R | year = 2001a | title = The Basic Problem of the Theory of Levels of Reality | url = | journal = Axiomathes | volume = 12 | issue = 3–4| pages = 261–283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poli R | year = 1998 | title = Levels | url = | journal = Axiomathes | volume = 9 | issue = 1–2| pages = 197–211 | doi=10.1007/bf02681712| pmid = 8053082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy of complexity levels of organization in the biosphere is also recognized in modern classifications
of taxonomic ranks, such as: [[domain (biology)|biological domain]] and biosphere, [[Kingdom (biology)|biological kingdom]], [[Phylum]], [[Class (biology)|biological class]], [[Order (biology)|order]], [[Family (biology)|family]], [[genus]] and [[species]]. Because of their dynamic and composition variability, intrinsic "fuzziness",  autopoietic attributes, ability to self-reproduce, and so on, organisms do not fit into the 'standard' definition of general systems, and they are therefore 'super-complex' in both their function and structure; organisms can be thus be defined in CSB only as '[[meta-system]]s' of simpler dynamic systems&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MST.html Metasystem Transition Theory], [[Valentin Turchin]], [[Cliff Joslyn]], 1993-1997&lt;/ref&gt; Such a meta-system definition of organisms, species, 'ecosystems', and so on, is  not equivalent to the definition of a ''system of systems'' as in [[Autopoiesis|Autopoietic System]]s Theory,;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archonic.net Reflexive Autopoietic Systems Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; it also differs from the definition proposed for example by K.D. Palmer in meta-system engineering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archonic.net/incosewg/ppframe.htm Meta-system Engineering], Kent D.

Tessellation or [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] provide however an intuitive, visual/computational insight into the lower levels of complexity, and have therefore become an increasingly popular, discrete model studied in computability theory, applied mathematics, physics, computer science, theoretical biology/systems biology, cancer simulations and microstructure modeling.

'''Computational lithography''' (also known as '''computational scaling''') is the set of mathematical and algorithmic approaches designed to improve the resolution attainable through [[photolithography]]. Computational lithography has come to the forefront of [[photolithography]] in 2008 as the [[semiconductor industry]] grappled with the challenges associated with the transition to [[22 nanometer]] [[CMOS]] [[process technology]] and beyond.

==193 nm deep UV photolithography==

The periodic enhancement in the resolution achieved through [[photolithography]] has been a driving force behind [[Moore's Law]]. Resolution improvements enable printing of smaller geometries on an [[integrated circuit]]. The minimum feature size that a projection system typically used in [[photolithography]] can print is given approximately by:

:&lt;math&gt;CD = k_1 \cdot\frac{\lambda}{NA}&lt;/math&gt;
where

&lt;math&gt;\,CD&lt;/math&gt; is the [[minimum feature size]] (also called the '''critical dimension''').

&lt;math&gt;\,\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]] of light used.

&lt;math&gt;\,NA&lt;/math&gt; is the [[numerical aperture]] of the lens as seen from the wafer.

&lt;math&gt;\,k_1&lt;/math&gt; (commonly called ''k1 factor'') is a coefficient that encapsulates process-related factors.

Historically, resolution enhancements in [[photolithography]] have been achieved through the progression of [[stepper]] illumination sources to smaller and smaller wavelengths &amp;mdash; from "g-line" (436&amp;nbsp;nm) and "i-line" (365&amp;nbsp;nm) sources based on [[mercury lamp]]s, to the current systems based on [[deep ultraviolet]] [[excimer laser]]s sources at 193&amp;nbsp;nm. However the progression to yet finer wavelength sources has been stalled by the intractable problems associated with [[extreme ultraviolet lithography]] and [[x-ray lithography]], forcing semiconductor manufacturers to extend the current 193&amp;nbsp;nm optical lithography systems until some form of [[next-generation lithography]] proves viable (although 157&amp;nbsp;nm steppers have also been marketed, they have proven cost-prohibitive at $50M each).&lt;ref name="Electronics2004"&gt;{{Citation | title = Reticle enhancement technology will extend life of 193nm litho | newspaper = Electronics Weekly | date = 2004-02-25 | url = http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2004/02/25/701/reticle-enhancement-technology-will-extend-life-of-193nm-litho-says.htm | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to improve resolution by increasing the numerical aperture have led to the use of [[immersion lithography]]. As further improvements in resolution through wavelength reduction or increases in numerical aperture have become either technically challenging or economically unfeasible, much attention has been paid to reducing the k1-factor. The k1 factor can be reduced through process improvements, such as [[phase-shift photomask]]s. These techniques have enabled [[photolithography]] at the [[32 nanometer]] CMOS process technology node using a wavelength of 193&amp;nbsp;nm (deep ultraviolet). However, with the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors|ITRS roadmap]] calling for the [[22 nanometer]] node to be in use by 2011, photolithography researchers have had to develop an additional suite of improvements to make 22&amp;nbsp;nm technology manufacturable.&lt;ref name="Moretti2008"&gt;{{Citation | last = Moretti | first = Gabe | title = Custom litho addresses 22-nm IC manufacturing | newspaper = EETimes | pages = | date = 2008-10-13 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=211200162 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the increase in mathematical modeling has been underway for some time, the degree and expense of those calculations has justified the use of a new term to cover the changing landscape: computational lithography.

==History ==
Computational lithography means the use of computers to simulate printing of micro-lithography structures. Pioneering work was done by [[Chris Mack (scientist)|Chris Mack]] at NSA in developing [[PROLITH]], Rick Dill at IBM and Andy Neureuther at University of California, Berkeley from the early 1980s. These tools were limited to lithography process optimization as the algorithms were limited to a few square micrometres of resist. Commercial full-chip optical proximity correction, using model forms, was first implemented by TMA (now a subsidiary of [[Synopsys]]) and Numerical Technologies (also part of Synopsys) around 1997.&lt;ref name="TMA1997"&gt;{{Citation | title = Major US Semiconductor Maker Chooses TMA for OPC Software | newspaper = PRNewswire | pages = | date = 1997-10-16 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19915757.html | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since then the market and complexity has grown significantly. With the move to sub-wavelength lithography at the 180&amp;nbsp;nm and 130&amp;nbsp;nm nodes, RET techniques such as Assist features, phase shift masks started to be used together with OPC. For the transition from 65&amp;nbsp;nm to 45&amp;nbsp;nm nodes customers were worrying that not only that design rules were insufficient to guarantee printing without yield limiting hotspots, but also that tape-out time may need thousands of CPUs or weeks of run time. This predicted exponential increase in computational complexity for mask synthesis on moving to the 45&amp;nbsp;nm process node spawned a significant venture capital investment in  [[design for manufacturability (IC)|design for manufacturing]] start-up companies.&lt;ref name="DylanMcGrathDFM2005"&gt;{{Citation | last = McGrath | first = Dylan | title = DFM pumps up the volume | newspaper = EETimes | pages =| date = 2005-12-16 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=175004316&amp;queryText=tcad&amp;printable=true&amp;printable=true | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of startup companies promoting their own disruptive solutions to this problem started to appear, techniques from custom hardware acceleration to radical new algorithms such as Inverse Lithography were touted to resolve the forthcoming bottlenecks. Despite this activity, incumbent OPC suppliers were able to adapt and keep their major customers, with RET and OPC being used together as for previous nodes, but now on more layers and with larger data files, and turn around time concerns were met by new algorithms and improvements in multi-core commodity processors. The term computational lithography was first used by Brion Technology (now a subsidiary of [[ASML Holding|ASML]]) in 2005&lt;ref name="DylanMcGrath2005"&gt;{{Citation | last = McGrath | first = Dylan | title = Litho simulation vendor opens Japanese subsidiary | newspaper = EETimes | pages = | date = 2005-02-12 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/news/semi/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=174900246 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote their hardware accelerated full chip lithography simulation platform. Since then the term has been used by the industry to describe full chip mask synthesis solutions.  As 45&amp;nbsp;nm goes into full production and EUV lithography introduction is delayed, 32&amp;nbsp;nm and 22&amp;nbsp;nm are expected to run on existing 193&amp;nbsp;nm scanners technology. 

Now, not only are throughput and capabilities concerns resurfacing, but also new computational lithography techniques such as source mask optimization (SMO) is seen as a way to squeeze better resolution specific to a given design. Today, all the major mask synthesis vendors have settled on the term "computational lithography" to describe and promote the set of mask synthesis technologies required for 22&amp;nbsp;nm.

==Techniques comprising computational lithography==
Computational lithography makes use of a number of numerical simulations to improve the performance (resolution and contrast) of cutting-edge photomasks.   The combined techniques include [[Resolution enhancement technologies|Resolution Enhancement Technology]] (RET), [[Optical Proximity Correction]] (OPC), Source Mask Optimization (SMO), etc.&lt;ref name="LaPedus2008"&gt;{{Citation | last = LaPedus | first = Mark | title = IBM rolls 'computational scaling' for litho at 22-nm | newspaper = EETimes | pages = | date = 2008-09-17 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=210602297 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques vary in terms of their technical feasibility and engineering sensible-ness, resulting in the adoption of some and the continual R&amp;D of others.&lt;ref name="LamWong2009"&gt;{{Citation | author = E.

Wong | title = Computation lithography: virtual reality and virtual virtuality | journal = Optics Express | volume = 17 | pages = 12259–12268 | year = 2009 | url = http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-17-15-12259 | doi = 10.1364/OE.17.012259 | pmid = 19654627 | issue = 15 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resolution enhancement technology ===
[[Resolution enhancement technologies]], first used in the [[90 nanometer]] generation, using the mathematics of [[diffraction optics]] to specify multi-layer [[phase-shift photomask]]s that use interference patterns in the photomask that enhance resolution on the printed wafer surface.

===Optical proximity correction ===
[[Optical proximity correction]] uses computational methods to counteract the effects of diffraction-related blurring and under-exposure by modifying on-mask geometries with means such as:
adjusting linewidths depending on the density of surrounding geometries (a trace surrounded by a large open area will be over-exposed compared with the same trace surrounded by a dense pattern), 
adding "dog-bone" endcaps to the end of lines to prevent line shortening, 
correcting for [[proximity effect (electron beam lithography)|electron beam proximity effects]]

OPC can be broadly divided into rule-based and model-based.&lt;ref name="opc"&gt;{{Citation | author=A. Wong | title=Resolution enhancement techniques in optical lithography | publisher=SPIE Press | year=2001 | postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inverse lithography technology, which treats the OPC as an inverse imaging problem, is also a useful technique because it can provide unintuitive mask patterns.&lt;ref name="sectioning"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-16-19-14746 | author=S.

===Complex modeling of the lens system and photoresist===
Beyond the models used for RET and OPC, computational lithographics attempts to improve chip manufacturability and yields such as by using the signature of the scanner to help improve accuracy of the OPC model:&lt;ref name="SynopsysNikon2007"&gt;{{Citation |last         = Hand |first        = Aaron |title        = Nikon and Synopsys Deliver on Advanced OPC Promise |newspaper    = Semiconductor International |year         = 2007 |date         = November 2006 |url          = http://www.semiconductor.net/article/206698-Nikon_and_Synopsys_Deliver_on_Advanced_OPC_Promise.php |postscript   = &lt;!--none--&gt; |access-date  = 2010-01-15 |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090809002450/http://www.semiconductor.net/article/206698-Nikon_and_Synopsys_Deliver_on_Advanced_OPC_Promise.php |archive-date = 2009-08-09 |dead-url     = yes |df           = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
polarization characteristics of the lens pupil,
[[Jones calculus|Jones matrix]] of the stepper lens,
optical parameters of the [[photoresist]] stack,

==A CPU-century worth of calculations or more==
The computational effort behind these methods is immense.  According to one estimate, the calculations required to adjust OPC geometries to take into account variations to focus and exposure for a state-of-the-art integrated circuit will take approximately 100 CPU-years of computer time.&lt;ref name="Wiley2006"&gt;{{Citation | last = Wiley | first = Jim | title = Future challenges in computational lithography | newspaper = Solid State Technology

'''Copper loss''' is the term often given to [[heat]] produced by [[electrical current]]s in the [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]s of [[transformer]] windings, or other electrical devices. Copper losses are an undesirable transfer of [[energy]], as are [[core loss]]es, which result from [[induced current]]s in adjacent components. The term is applied regardless of whether the windings are made of [[copper]] or another conductor, such as [[aluminium]]. Hence the term '''winding loss''' is often preferred.  The term [[load loss]] is closely related but not identical, since an unloaded transformer will have some winding loss.

==Calculations==
Copper losses result from [[Joule heating]] and so are also referred to as "I squared R losses", in reference to [[Joule's first law|Joule's First Law]]. This states that the energy lost each [[second]], or [[Power (physics)|power]], increases as the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the current through the windings and in [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] to the [[electrical resistance]] of the conductors.

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Copper Loss} \propto I^2 \cdot R&lt;/math&gt;

where I is the current flowing in the conductor and R the resistance of the conductor. With I in [[ampere]]s and R in ohms, the calculated power loss is given in [[watt]]s.

Joule heating has a [[coefficient of performance]] of 1.0, meaning that every 1 watt of electrical power is converted to 1 Joule of heat. Therefore, the energy lost due to copper loss is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Copper Loss} = I^2 \cdot R \cdot t&lt;/math&gt;

where t is the time in [[second]]s the current is maintained. 

==Effect of frequency==
For low-frequency applications, the power lost can be minimized by employing conductors with a large cross-sectional area, made from low-[[resistivity]] metals.

With high-frequency currents, the [[Proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]] and [[skin effect]] cause the current to be unevenly distributed across the conductor, increasing its effective resistance, and making loss calculations more difficult.

[[Litz wire]] is a type of wire constructed to force the current to be distributed uniformly, thereby reducing Joule heating.

==Reducing copper loss==
Among other measures, the electrical energy efficiency of a typical industrial [[induction motor]] can be improved by reducing the electrical losses in the [[stator]] windings (e.g., by increasing the cross-sectional area of the conductor, improving the winding technique, and using materials with higher electrical conductivities, such as copper).

'''Crowdreviewing''' is the practice of gathering opinion or feedback from a large number of people, typically via the internet or an online community; a [[portmanteau]] of “crowd” and “reviews”. Crowdreviewing is also often viewed as a form of crowd voting which occurs when a website gathers a large group's opinions and judgment.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite news|title=IEM Demonstrates the Political Wisdom of Crowds |first=John |last=Robson |url=http://tippie.uiowa.edu/iem/media/story.cfm?id=2793 |newspaper=Canoe.ca |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is based on the principles of  [[crowdsourcing]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and lets users submit online reviews to participate in building online metrics that measure performance. By harnessing social collaboration in the form of feedback individuals are generally able to form a more informed opinion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Crowdreviews: Today’s Word of Mouth - Search Marketing Standard Magazine {{!}} Covering Search Engines|url = http://www.searchmarketingstandard.com/crowdreviews-todays-word-mouth|website = www.searchmarketingstandard.com|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Crowdreviews |url = http://www.crowdreviews.com/frequently-asked-questions#what-is-crowdreviewing|website = www.crowdreviews.com|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Article - CrowdReviews.com takes lead as a top reputation tool - sourced from the crowd by visibility|publisher=Visibility Magazine|url = http://www.visibilitymagazine.com/crowdreviews-com-takes-lead-as-a-top-reputation-tool-sourced-from-the-crowd/|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Crowdsourced Performance Review: How to Use the Power of Social Recognition to Transform Employee Performance|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F0qsK46nSA0C|publisher = McGraw Hill Professional|date = 2013-05-31|isbn = 9780071817998|first = Eric|last = Mosley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Information Systems and Technology for Organizational Agility, Intelligence, and Resilience|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lw6XBQAAQBAJ|publisher = IGI Global|date = 2014-04-30|isbn = 9781466659711|first = Rahman|last=Hakikur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the crowd==
In crowdreviewing the crowd becomes the source of information used in determining the relative performance of products and services.&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite news|last= Safire | first= William | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/magazine/08wwln-safire-t.html?_r=3&amp;ref=magazine&amp; | title= On Language | publisher= New York Times Magazine | date= February 5, 2009 | accessdate= May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As crowdreviewing focuses on receiving input from a large number of parties, the resulting collaboration produces more credible feedback compared to the feedback left by a single party. The responsibility of identifying strengths and weaknesses falls to multiple individuals which each have had their own experience rather than on a single individual. Buyers will therefore be more likely to trust the feedback of a collective group of people rather than a single individual.&lt;ref name="estelles"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Estellés-Arolas | first1 = Enrique | last2 = González-Ladrón-de-Guevara | first2 = Fernando | title = Towards an Integrated Crowdsourcing Definition | journal = Journal of Information Science | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | year = 2012 | pages = 189–200 | url = http://www.crowdsourcing-blog.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Towards-an-integrated-crowdsourcing-definition-Estell%C3%A9s-Gonz%C3%A1lez.pdf| format=PDF | doi=10.1177/0165551512437638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = wired2007&gt;

== Common Parties ==
The crowd consists of a number of different parties which have various interests in regards to the outcome produced.&lt;ref name="Prpić, J 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prpić| first=J|author2=Shukla, P. |author3=Roth, Y. |author4=Lemoine, J.F. |year=2015 |chapter=A Geography of Participation in IT-Mediated Crowds |title=Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences 2015.|ssrn=2494537|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential Customers ===
A potential customer of a product or service would have an interest in viewing information on how a particular product or service stands in terms of subjective or objective quality before making a purchasing decision. Potential customers may also be interested in leaving feedback on a particular product or service to explain why they didn’t make their purchase.&lt;ref name="kaufmann"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufmann | first1 = N. | last2 = Schulze | first2 =T. | last3 = Viet | first3 = D. | title = More than fun and money.

=== Customers ===
Customers of products and services are a primary party in the process of reviewing. Customers are closely connected to the process as they would have first-hand experience with a product and service. Their primary role would be detailing their experiences with the product or service. A customer’s interest in crowdreviewing would stem from an interest in showing their appreciation towards the quality of a product or service or in voicing their concerns or disappointment in a product or service.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Sellers ===
Sellers usually get their satisfied customers involved in leaving reviews for their products and services. A seller has an interest in having positive feedback on display as a means to influence potential buyers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bracken, D.W., Rose, D.S. (2011) "When does 360-degree Feedback create behavior change? And How would we know when it does?"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competitors ===
Competitors would have an interest in reviewing feedback from the crowd as a means of obtaining competitive intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There may be other audiences involved in the process such as employees, suppliers, partners, and other relevant parties.&lt;ref name="Britt"&gt;{{cite web |title = Crowdsourcing: The Debate Roars On |url= http://insite.artinstitutes.edu/crowdsourcing-the-debate-roars-on-39739.aspx | first= Darice|last= Britt | accessdate= 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits and risks ==
There are a number of benefits to the different parties which make up the crowd. Potential buyers are able to obtain information on products and services prior to making a purchase. Those which have already bought or used the product or service are able to post experiences both positive and negative in order to inform other potential buyers. As an additional benefit to the buyers, buyers may also post negative reviews in hopes of resolving their negative experiences with their seller. Sellers have the benefits of receiving positive feedback and also potentially resolving issues with dissatisfied customers. Competitors are able to learn more about what their competition is doing in order to improve their own products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burnap|first1=Alex|last2=Ren|first2=Alex J.|last3=Papazoglou|first3=Giannis|last4=Gerth|first4=Richard|last5=Gonzalez|first5=Richard|last6=Papalambros|first6=Panos|title=When Crowdsourcing Fails: A Study of Expertise on Crowdsourced Design Evaluation|format=PDF |url= http://ode.engin.umich.edu/publications/PapalambrosPapers/2015/316J.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aitamurto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/963662/The_Promise_of_Idea_Crowdsourcing_Benefits_Contexts_Limitations |title=The Promise of Idea Crowdsourcing: Benefits, Contexts, Limitations &amp;#124; Tanja Aitamurto |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ipeirotis2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ipeirotis |last2 = Provost |last3=Wang |year=2010 |title=Quality Management on Amazon Mechanical Turk |format=PDF |url= http://people.stern.nyu.edu/panos/publications/hcomp2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the benefits associated with crowdreviewing, there are a number of risks and challenges to overcome. For potential buyers there is always the risk that reviews may be sourced by the vendors themselves or other parties paid to leave a specific type of feedback on a product or service. Sellers have the possibility of receiving negative reviews which may in turn negatively influence their reputation and affect their bottom line revenue numbers. Competitors, while enjoying the benefit of being able to learn from their competitors are also subject to their competitors learning about their positives and negatives.&lt;ref name="aitamurto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite news |title = The Myth of Crowdsourcing |url= https://www.forbes.com/2009/09/28/crowdsourcing-enterprise-innovation-technology-cio-network-jargonspy.html | first= Dan |last=Woods | date=28 September 2009 | accessdate= 2012-12-04 | work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and controversies ==

=== Size of the Crowd ===
One of the major factors influencing crowdreviewing is the size of the crowd involved. A crowdreviewing venture is positively influenced by having a large number of parties leave reviews and feedback on products and services. In cases where a small number of individuals leave their feedback, more weight is placed on an individual reviewer or opinion and could therefore be of minimal value to potential customers. A smaller sample of reviews may also exhibit bias towards or against the product or service.&lt;ref name="Borst"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Case For and Against Crowdsourcing: Part 2 |url= http://www.crowdsourcing.org/editorial/the-case-for-and-against-crowdsourcing-part-2/2850 | first= Irma |last= Borst | accessdate= 2015-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industry Knowledge ===
A common limitation of allowing all parties to have an opportunity to review a product or service may involve having reviews written without a minimal or meaningful understanding of the product or service. A lack of industry or specialized knowledge may in turn minimize the value of a review or potentially inversely affect what would be considered a fair review.&lt;ref name="Borst" /&gt;

=== Seller Manipulation ===
With allowing multiple parties to review a product or service there is a possibility that a seller may attempt to manipulate reviews in a number of ways. Sellers may hire third parties or create fake identities in order to leave positive reviews on their product or service. They may also do the same to create negative reviews on competing products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Ipeirotis |year=2010 |title= Analyzing the Amazon Mechanical Turk Marketplace |journal=XRDS: Crossroads, The ACM Magazine for Students |volume=17 |issue=2 |publisher = ACM |url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869094/p16-ipeirotis.pdf?ip=128.237.228.168&amp;acc=OPEN&amp;CFID=67955182&amp;CFTOKEN=99801176&amp;__acm__=1330412802_d8ed25958879e894447fe2c38fb1cf1a |format=PDF| accessdate=February 26, 2012|doi=10.1145/1870000/1869094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Balance of Negative and Positive Reviews ===
Customers which have a negative experience with a product or service are more likely to offer a their review in an effort to resolve buyer’s remorse in comparison to those which have had a positive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kurve|first1=Aditya|last2=Miller|first2=David J.|last3=Kesidis|first3=George|title=Multicategory Crowdsourcing Accounting for Variable Task Difficulty, Worker Skill, and Worker Intention|journal=IEEE KDE|date=30 May 2014|issue=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== One Side of the Story ===
Those reading reviews on products and services are likely to view reviews which only tell one side to the story. This is a disadvantage to both a potential customer and seller as the review may not tell the other side of a story which may be based on a misunderstanding.&lt;ref name="Britt2"&gt;{{cite web |title = Crowdsourcing: The Debate Roars On |url= http://insite.artinstitutes.edu/crowdsourcing-the-debate-roars-on-39739.aspx | first= Darice|last= Britt | accessdate= 2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematical physics]], '''de Sitter invariant special relativity''' is the speculative idea that the fundamental [[symmetry group]] of [[spacetime]] is the [[indefinite orthogonal group]] SO(4,1), that of [[de Sitter space]]. In the standard theory of [[general relativity]], de Sitter space is a highly symmetrical special [[vacuum solution]], which requires a [[cosmological constant]] or the [[Stress–energy tensor|stress–energy]] of a constant [[scalar field]] to sustain.

The idea of de Sitter invariant relativity is to require that the laws of physics are not fundamentally invariant under the [[Poincaré group]] of [[special relativity]], but under the symmetry group of de Sitter space instead. With this assumption, empty space automatically has de Sitter symmetry, and what would normally be called the cosmological constant in general relativity becomes a fundamental dimensional parameter describing the symmetry structure of spacetime.

First proposed by [[Luigi Fantappiè]] in 1954, the theory remained obscure until it was rediscovered in 1968 by [[Henri Bacry]] and [[Jean-Marc Lévy-Leblond]]. In 1972, [[Freeman Dyson]] popularized it as a hypothetical road by which mathematicians could have guessed part of the structure of general relativity before it was discovered.&lt;ref name=dyson&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion of the universe]] has led to a revival of interest in de Sitter invariant theories, in conjunction with other speculative proposals for new physics, like [[doubly special relativity]].

==Introduction==
{{main|de Sitter space}}

[[De Sitter]] suggested that spacetime curvature might not be due solely to gravity&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=W. de Sitter
 |year=1917
 |title=On the curvature of space
 |journal=Proc. Roy. Acad. Sci. Amsterdam
 |volume=20 |issue= |pages=229–243
}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not give any mathematical details of how this could be accomplished. In 1968 [[Henri Bacry]] and [[Jean-Marc Lévy-Leblond]] showed that the de Sitter group was the most general group compatible with isotropy, homogeneity and boost invariance.&lt;ref name=posskinem/&gt; Later, [[Freeman Dyson]]&lt;ref name=dyson/&gt; advocated this as an approach to making the mathematical structure of general relativity more self-evident.

[[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]]'s unification of space and time within [[special relativity]] replaces the [[Galilean group]] of [[Newtonian mechanics]] with the [[Lorentz group]]. This is called a unification of space and time because the Lorentz group is [[simple group|simple]], while the Galilean group is a [[semi-direct product]] of rotations and [[Galilean transformation|Galilean boosts]]. This means that the Lorentz group mixes up space and time such that they cannot be disentangled, while the Galilean group treats time as a parameter with different units of measurement than space.

An analogous thing can be made to happen with the ordinary rotation group in three dimensions. If you imagine a nearly flat world, one in which pancake-like creatures wander around on a pancake flat world, their conventional unit of height might be the [[micrometre]] (''μm''), since that is how high typical structures are in their world, while their unit of distance could be the metre, because that is their body's horizontal extent.  Such creatures would describe the basic symmetry of their world as [[SO(2)]], being the known rotations in the horizontal (x–y) plane. Later on, they might discover rotations around the x- and y-axes—and in their everyday experience such rotations might always be by an infinitesimal angle, so that these rotations would effectively commute with each other.

The rotations around the horizontal axes would tilt objects by an infinitesimal amount. The tilt in the x–z plane (the "x-tilt") would be one parameter, and the tilt in the y–z plane (the "y-tilt") another. The symmetry group of this pancake world is then SO(2) semidirect product with '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, meaning that a two-dimensional rotation plus two extra parameters, the x-tilt and the y-tilt. The reason it is a semidirect product is that, when you rotate, the x-tilt and the y-tilt rotate into each other, since they form a [[Visualization software|vector]] and not two [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]s. In this world, the difference in height between two objects at the same x, y would be a rotationally invariant quantity unrelated to length and width. The z-coordinate is effectively separate from x and y.

Eventually, experiments at large angles would convince the creatures that the symmetry of the world is [[SO(3)]]. Then they would understand that z is really the same as x and y, since they can be mixed up by rotations. The SO(2) semidirect product R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; limit would be understood as the limit that the free parameter ''μ'', the ratio of the height range ''μm'' to the length range ''m'', approaches 0. The Lorentz group is analogous—it is a simple group that turns into the Galilean group when the time range is made long compared to the space range, or where velocities may be regarded as infinitesimal, or equivalently, may be regarded as the limit {{nowrap|''c''  → ∞}}, where relativistic effects become observable "as good as at infinite velocity".

The symmetry group of special relativity is not entirely simple, due to translations. The Lorentz group is the set of the transformations that keep the origin fixed, but translations are not included. The full Poincaré group is the semi-direct product of translations with the Lorentz group. If translations are to be similar to elements of the Lorentz group, then as [[Lorentz boost|boosts]] are [[non-commutative]], [[translation (physics)|translations]] would also be non-commutative.

In the pancake world, this would manifest if the creatures were living on an enormous sphere rather than on a plane.  In this case, when they wander around their sphere, they would eventually come to realize that translations are not entirely separate from rotations, because if they move around on the surface of a sphere, when they come back to where they started, they find that they have been rotated by the [[holonomy]] of [[parallel transport]] on the sphere. If the universe is the same everywhere (homogeneous) and there are no preferred directions (isotropic), then there are not many options for the symmetry group: they either live on a flat plane, or on a sphere with a constant positive curvature, or on a [[Lobachevski plane]] with constant negative curvature.  If they are not living on the plane, they can describe positions using dimensionless angles, the same parameters that describe rotations, so that translations and rotations are nominally unified.

In relativity, if translations mix up nontrivially with rotations, but the universe is still [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]], the only option is that spacetime has a uniform scalar curvature. If the curvature is positive, the analog of the sphere case for the two-dimensional creatures, the spacetime is [[de Sitter space]] and its symmetry group is the de Sitter group rather than the [[Poincaré group]].

De Sitter special relativity postulates that the empty space has de Sitter symmetry as a fundamental law of nature. This means that spacetime is slightly curved even in the absence of matter or energy. This residual [[spacetime curvature|curvature]] implies a positive [[cosmological constant]] {{math|''Λ''}} to be determined by observation. Due to the small magnitude of the constant, special relativity with its Poincaré group is indistinguishable from de Sitter space for most practical purposes.

Modern proponents of this idea, such as S. Cacciatori, V. Gorini and A. Kamenshchik,&lt;ref name=c21st&gt;

They postulate that the acceleration of the expansion of the universe is not entirely due to [[Dark energy|vacuum energy]], but at least partly due to the kinematics of the [[de Sitter]] [[group (mathematics)|group]], which would replace the [[Poincaré group]].

A modification of this idea allows &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; to change with time, so that [[inflation]] may come from the cosmological constant being larger near the [[big bang]] than nowadays. It can also be viewed as a different approach to the problem of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref name="newroad"&gt;

===High energy===
The [[Poincaré group]] [[Galilean transformation#Origin in group contraction|contracts]] to the [[Galilean group]] for low-velocity [[kinematics]], meaning that when all velocities are small the Poincaré group "morphs" into the Galilean group. (This can be made precise with [[Erdal İnönü|İnönü]] and [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]]'s concept of [[group contraction]].&lt;ref&gt;

Similarly, the de Sitter group  [[group contraction|contracts]] to the Poincaré group for short-distance kinematics, when the magnitudes of all translations considered are very small compared to the de Sitter radius.&lt;ref name="newroad"/&gt; In quantum mechanics, short distances are probed by high energies, so that for energies above a very small value related to the cosmological constant, the Poincaré group is a good approximation to the de Sitter group.

In de Sitter relativity, the cosmological constant is no longer a free parameter of the same type; it is determined by the de Sitter radius, a fundamental quantity that determines the commutation relation of translation with rotations/boosts. This means that the theory of de Sitter relativity might be able to provide insight on the value of the cosmological constant, perhaps explaining the [[Dark energy#Quintessence|cosmic coincidence]]. Unfortunately, the de Sitter radius, which determines the cosmological constant, is an adjustable parameter in de Sitter relativity, so the theory requires a separate condition to determine its value in relation to the measurement scale.

When a cosmological constant is viewed as a kinematic parameter, the definitions of energy and momentum must be changed from those of special relativity. These changes could significantly modify the physics of the early universe if the cosmological constant was greater back then. Some speculate that a high energy experiment could modify the local structure of spacetime from [[Minkowski space]] to [[de Sitter space]] with a large cosmological constant for a short period of time, and this might eventually be tested in the existing or planned [[particle collider]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Doubly special relativity===
{{main|Doubly special relativity}}

Since the de Sitter group naturally incorporates an invariant length parameter, de Sitter relativity can be interpreted as an example of the so-called [[doubly special relativity]]. There is a fundamental difference, though: whereas in all doubly special relativity models the Lorentz symmetry is violated, in de Sitter relativity it remains as a physical symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A drawback of the usual doubly special relativity models is that they are valid only at the energy scales where ordinary special relativity is supposed to break down, giving rise to a patchwork relativity. On the other hand, de Sitter relativity is found to be invariant under a simultaneous re-scaling of [[mass]], [[energy]] and [[momentum]],&lt;ref name=dessrintro&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the effect that in the nonrelativistic limit, objects in de Sitter space have an extra "repulsion" from the origin: objects have a tendency to move away from the center with an outward pointing [[fictitious force]] proportional to their distance from the origin.

While it looks as though this might pick out a preferred point in space—the center of repulsion, it is more subtly isotropic. Moving to the uniformly accelerated frame of reference of an observer at another point, all accelerations appear to have a repulsion center at the new point.

What this means is that in a spacetime with non-vanishing curvature, gravity is modified from Newtonian gravity.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:FLETC Glynco-aerial.gif|thumb|Aerial photo of [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center|FLETC]], where US digital forensics standards were developed in the 1980s and '90s]]

'''Digital forensics''' (sometimes known as '''digital forensic science''') is a branch of [https://www.digitalforensic.in/2018/11/what-is-digital-forensic.html forensic science] encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to [[computer crime]].&lt;ref name="ijde-2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carrier" /&gt; The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for [https://www.digitalforensic.in/2018/11/Change-MetaData-of-Image.html computer forensics] but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of [[Computer data storage|storing digital data]].&lt;ref name="ijde-2002" /&gt; With roots in the [[Home computer#The Home Computer .22Revolution.22|personal computing revolution]] of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.

Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before [[criminal court|criminal]] or [[civil litigation|civil]] courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as murder, theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as [[electronic discovery]] (ediscovery) may be involved.

Forensics may also feature in the private sector; such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigation (a specialist probe into the nature and extent of an unauthorized [[Hacker (computer security)|network intrusion]]).

The technical aspect of an investigation is divided into several sub-branches, relating to the type of digital devices involved; computer forensics, [[network forensics]], [[forensic data analysis]] and [[mobile device forensics]]. The typical forensic process encompasses the seizure, forensic imaging (acquisition) and analysis of digital media and the production of a report into collected evidence.

As well as identifying direct evidence of a crime, digital forensics can be used to attribute evidence to specific suspects, confirm [[alibi]]s or statements, determine [[Mens rea|intent]], identify sources (for example, in copyright cases), or authenticate documents.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; Investigations are much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis (where the usual aim is to provide answers to a series of simpler questions) often involving complex time-lines or hypotheses.&lt;ref name="df-basics"/&gt;

==How It Began==
Prior to the 1970s crimes involving computers were dealt with using existing laws. The first [[computer crime]]s were recognized in the 1978 Florida Computer Crimes Act, which included legislation against the unauthorized modification or deletion of data on a computer system.&lt;ref name="floract" /&gt;&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt; Over the next few years the range of computer crimes being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of [[copyright]], privacy/harassment (e.g., [[cyber bullying]], [[cyber stalking]], and [[online predator]]s) and [[child pornography]].&lt;ref name="exposed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="briefhistory" /&gt; It was not until the 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences. Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt; This was followed by the US Federal ''[[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]]'' in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989 and the British ''Computer Misuse Act'' in 1990.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="briefhistory" /&gt;

===1980s–1990s: Growth of the field===
The growth in computer crime during the 1980s and 1990s caused [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] to begin establishing specialized groups, usually at the national level, to handle the technical aspects of investigations. For example, in 1984 the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] launched a ''Computer Analysis and Response Team'' and the following year a computer crime department was set up within the British [[Metropolitan Police]] fraud squad. As well as being law enforcement professionals, many of the early members of these groups were also computer hobbyists and became responsible for the field's initial research and direction.&lt;ref name="mohay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sommer" /&gt;

One of the first practical (or at least publicized) examples of digital forensics was [[Clifford Stoll|Cliff Stoll's]] pursuit of hacker [[Markus Hess]] in 1986. Stoll, whose investigation made use of computer and network forensic techniques, was not a specialized examiner.&lt;ref name="garfinkel" /&gt; Many of the earliest forensic examinations followed the same profile.&lt;ref name=dummies /&gt;

Throughout the 1990s there were high demand for these new, and basic, investigative resources. The strain on central units lead to the creation of regional, and even local, level groups to help handle the load. For example, the British [[National Hi-Tech Crime Unit]] was set up in 2001 to provide a national infrastructure for computer crime; with personnel located both centrally in London and with the various [[List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom#Territorial police forces|regional police forces]] (the unit was folded into the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) in 2006).&lt;ref name="sommer" /&gt;

During this period the science of digital forensics grew from the ad-hoc tools and techniques developed by these hobbyist practitioners. This is in contrast to other forensics disciplines which developed from work by the scientific community.&lt;ref name="ijde-2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="palmer" /&gt; It was not until 1992 that the term "computer forensics" was used in [[Academic publishing|academic literature]] (although prior to this it had been in informal use); a paper by Collier and Spaul attempted to justify this new discipline to the forensic science world.&lt;ref name="wilding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt; This swift development resulted in a lack of standardization and training. In his 1995 book, "''High-Technology Crime: Investigating Cases Involving Computers''", K. Rosenblatt wrote:

{{quote|Seizing, preserving, and analyzing evidence stored on a computer is the greatest forensic challenge  facing law enforcement in the 1990s. Although most forensic tests, such as fingerprinting and DNA testing, are performed by specially trained experts the task of collecting and analyzing computer evidence is often assigned to patrol officers and detectives.&lt;ref name="rosenblatt" /&gt;}}

===2000s: Developing standards===
Since 2000, in response to the need for standardization, various bodies and agencies have published guidelines for digital forensics. The [[Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence]] (SWGDE) produced a 2002 paper, "''Best practices for Computer Forensics''", this was followed, in 2005, by the publication of an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard [https://www.anab.org/training/forensic (ISO 17025, ''General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories'']).&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SWGDE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iso17025" /&gt; A European lead international treaty, the [[Convention on Cybercrime]], came into force in 2004 with the aim of reconciling national computer crime laws, investigative techniques and international co-operation. The treaty has been signed by 43 nations (including the US, Canada, Japan, South Africa, UK and other European nations) and ratified by 16.

The issue of training also received attention. Commercial companies (often forensic software developers) began to offer certification programs and digital forensic analysis was included as a topic at the UK specialist investigator training facility, [[Centrex (police training agency)|Centrex]].&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sommer" /&gt;

Since the late 1990s mobile devices have become more widely available, advancing beyond simple communication devices, and have been found to be rich forms of information, even for crime not traditionally associated with digital forensics.&lt;ref name="punja" /&gt; Despite this, digital analysis of phones has lagged behind traditional computer media, largely due to problems over the proprietary nature of devices.&lt;ref name="ahmed" /&gt;

Focus has also shifted onto internet crime, particularly the risk of [[cyber warfare]] and [[cyberterrorism]]. A February 2010 report by the [[United States Joint Forces Command]] concluded:
{{quote|Through cyberspace, enemies will target industry, academia, government, as well as the military in the air, land, maritime, and space domains. In much the same way that airpower transformed the battlefield of World War II, cyberspace has fractured the physical barriers that shield a nation from attacks on its commerce and communication.&lt;ref name=JOE /&gt;}}

The field of digital forensics still faces unresolved issues. A 2009 paper, "Digital Forensic Research: The Good, the Bad and the Unaddressed", by Peterson and Shenoi identified a bias towards Windows operating systems in digital forensics research.&lt;ref name="goodbadugly" /&gt; In 2010 [[Simson Garfinkel]] identified issues facing digital investigations in the future, including the increasing size of digital media, the wide availability of encryption to consumers, a growing variety of operating systems and file formats, an increasing number of individuals owning multiple devices, and legal limitations on investigators. The paper also identified continued training issues, as well as the prohibitively high cost of entering the field.&lt;ref name="garfinkel" /&gt;

===Development of forensic tools===
{{Main|List of digital forensics tools}}
During the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed [[Computer forensics#Live analysis|live analysis]] on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing [[System administrator|sysadmin]] tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.

The need for such software was first recognized in 1989 at the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]], resulting in the creation of IMDUMP (by Michael White) and in 1990, SafeBack (developed by Sydex). Similar software was developed in other countries; DIBS (a hardware and software solution) was released commercially in the UK in 1991, and Rob McKemmish released ''Fixed Disk Image'' free to Australian law enforcement.&lt;ref name="mohay" /&gt;  These tools allowed examiners to create an exact copy of a piece of digital media to work on, leaving the original disk intact for verification. By the end of the 1990s, as demand for digital evidence grew more advanced commercial tools such as [[EnCase]] and [[Forensic Toolkit|FTK]] were developed, allowing analysts to examine copies of media without using any live forensics.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;  More recently, a trend towards "live memory forensics" has grown resulting in the availability of tools such as [[WindowsSCOPE]].

More recently, the same progression of tool development has occurred for [[mobile device]]s; initially investigators accessed data directly on the device, but soon specialist tools such as XRY or Radio Tactics Aceso appeared.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

==Forensic process==
[[File:Portable forensic tableau.JPG|thumb|right|220px|A portable Tableau write-blocker attached to a [[hard drive]]]]
{{Main|Digital forensic process}}

A digital forensic investigation commonly consists of 3 stages: acquisition or [[Disk imaging#Hard drive imaging|imaging]] of exhibits,&lt;ref name="adams" /&gt; analysis, and reporting.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="first" /&gt; Ideally acquisition involves capturing an image of the computer's volatile memory (RAM)&lt;ref name="liveram"/&gt; and creating an exact [[Disk sector|sector]] level duplicate (or "forensic duplicate") of the media, often using a [[Forensic disk controller|write blocking]] device to prevent modification of the original. However, the growth in size of storage media and developments such as cloud computing &lt;ref name="adamscloud" /&gt; have led to more use of 'live' acquisitions whereby a 'logical' copy of the data is acquired rather than a complete image of the physical storage device.&lt;ref name="adams"/&gt; Both acquired image (or logical copy) and original media/data are [[Glossary of digital forensics terms#hashed|hashed]] (using an algorithm such as [[SHA-1]] or [[MD5]]) and the values compared to verify the copy is accurate.&lt;ref name="horenbeeck"/&gt;

An alternative (and patented)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-11-25|others=Elliot Spencer, Samuel J. Baker, Erik Andersen, Perlustro LP|title=Method and system for searching for, and collecting, electronically-stored information|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US8392706}}&lt;/ref&gt; approach (that has been dubbed 'hybrid forensics'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richard|first=Adams,|last2=Graham|first2=Mann,|last3=Valerie|first3=Hobbs,|date=2017|title=ISEEK, a tool for high speed, concurrent, distributed forensic data acquisition|url=http://ro.ecu.edu.au/adf/171/|journal=Research Online|language=en|doi=10.4225/75/5a838d3b1d27f}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 'distributed forensics'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoelz|first=Bruno W.

This approach has been embodied in a commercial tool called ISEEK that was presented together with test results at a conference in 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the analysis phase an investigator recovers evidence material using a number of different methodologies and tools. In 2002, an article in the ''International Journal of Digital Evidence'' referred to this step as "an in-depth systematic search of evidence related to the suspected crime."&lt;ref name="ijde-2002" /&gt; In 2006, forensics researcher [[Brian Carrier]] described an "intuitive procedure" in which obvious evidence is first identified and then "exhaustive searches are conducted to start filling in the holes."&lt;ref name="df-basics"/&gt;

The actual process of analysis can vary between investigations, but common methodologies include conducting keyword searches across the digital media (within files as well as unallocated and [[Fragmentation (computer)#Internal fragmentation|slack space]]), recovering deleted files and extraction of registry information (for example to list user accounts, or attached USB devices).

The evidence recovered is analysed to reconstruct events or actions and to reach conclusions, work that can often be performed by less specialised staff.&lt;ref name="ijde-2002" /&gt; When an investigation is complete the data is presented, usually in the form of a written report, in [[layman|lay persons]]' terms.&lt;ref name="ijde-2002" /&gt;

==Application==
[[File:En exif data.png|thumb|right|An example of an image's [[Exif]] [[metadata]] that might be used to prove its origin]]

Digital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts.  As with other areas of forensics this is often as part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.

In civil litigation or corporate matters digital forensics forms part of the [[electronic discovery]] (or eDiscovery) process. Forensic procedures are similar to those used in criminal investigations, often with different legal requirements and limitations. Outside of the courts digital forensics can form a part of internal corporate investigations.

A common example might be following unauthorized [[Hacker (computer security)|network intrusion]]. A specialist forensic examination into the nature and extent of the attack is performed as a damage limitation exercise. Both to establish the extent of any intrusion and in an attempt to identify the attacker.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="df-basics" /&gt; Such attacks were commonly conducted over phone lines during the 1980s, but in the modern era are usually propagated over the Internet.&lt;ref name=kruse /&gt;

The main focus of digital forensics investigations is to recover objective evidence of a criminal activity (termed [[actus reus]] in legal parlance). However, the diverse range of data held in digital devices can help with other areas of inquiry.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

;Attribution
:Meta data and other logs can be used to attribute actions to an individual. For example, personal documents on a computer drive might identify its owner.
;Alibis and statements
:Information provided by those involved can be cross checked with digital evidence. For example, during the investigation into the [[Soham murders]] the offender's alibi was disproved when mobile phone records of the person he claimed to be with showed she was out of town at the time.
;Intent
:As well as finding objective evidence of a crime being committed, investigations can also be used to prove the intent (known by the legal term [[mens rea]]). For example, the Internet history of convicted killer [[Neil Entwistle]] included references to a site discussing ''How to kill people''.
;Evaluation of source
:File artifacts and meta-data can be used to identify the origin of a particular piece of data; for example, older versions of [[Microsoft Word]] embedded a Global Unique Identifier into files which identified the computer it had been created on. Proving whether a file was produced on the digital device being examined or obtained from elsewhere (e.g., the Internet) can be very important.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;
;Document authentication
:Related to "Evaluation of source," meta data associated with digital documents can be easily modified (for example, by changing the computer clock you can affect the creation date of a file). Document authentication relates to detecting and identifying falsification of such details.

===Limitations===
One major limitation to a forensic investigation is the use of encryption; this disrupts initial examination where pertinent evidence might be located using keywords. Laws to compel individuals to [[key disclosure law|disclose encryption keys]] are still relatively new and controversial.&lt;ref name="garfinkel" /&gt;

==Legal considerations==
The examination of digital media is covered by national and international legislation. For civil investigations, in particular, laws may restrict the abilities of analysts to undertake examinations. Restrictions against [[network monitoring]], or reading of personal communications often exist.&lt;ref name="mocas" /&gt; During criminal investigation, national laws restrict how much information can be seized.&lt;ref name="mocas" /&gt; For example, in the United Kingdom seizure of evidence by law enforcement is governed by the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|PACE act]].&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt; During its existence early in the field, the "International Organization on Computer Evidence" (IOCE) was one agency that worked to establish compatible international standards for the seizure of evidence.&lt;ref name="kanellis" /&gt;

In the UK the same laws covering computer crime can also affect forensic investigators. The 1990 [[Computer Misuse Act 1990|computer misuse act]] legislates against unauthorised access to computer material; this is a particular concern for civil investigators who have more limitations than law enforcement.

An individuals right to privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] places limitations on the ability of law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as [[VOIP]]). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rosenblatt" /&gt; The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as to the extent to which a company can perform such monitoring.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

[[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] asserts similar privacy limitations to the ECPA and limits the processing and sharing of personal data both within the EU and with external countries. The ability of UK law enforcement to conduct digital forensics investigations is legislated by the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]].&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

===Digital evidence===
[[File:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg|thumb|right|Digital evidence can come in a number of forms]]
{{Main|Digital evidence}}

When used in a [[court of law]] digital evidence falls under the same legal guidelines as other forms of evidence; courts do not usually require more stringent guidelines.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="legal"/&gt; In the United States the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] are used to evaluate the [[Admissible evidence|admissibility]] of digital evidence, the United Kingdom PACE and Civil Evidence acts have similar guidelines and many other countries have their own laws. US federal laws restrict seizures to items with only obvious evidential value. This is acknowledged as not always being possible to establish with digital media prior to an examination.&lt;ref name="mocas" /&gt;

Laws dealing with digital evidence are concerned with two issues: integrity and authenticity. Integrity is ensuring that the act of seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence.&lt;ref name="mocas" /&gt; The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the [[chain of custody]] from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of [[audit]] trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

Attorneys have argued that because digital evidence can theoretically be altered it undermines the reliability of the evidence. US judges are beginning to reject this theory, in the case ''US v. Bonallo'' the court ruled that "the fact that it is possible to alter data contained in a computer is plainly insufficient to establish untrustworthiness."&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bonallo" /&gt; In the United Kingdom guidelines such as those issued by [[Association of Chief Police Officers|ACPO]] are followed to help document the authenticity and integrity of evidence.

Digital investigators, particularly in criminal investigations, have to ensure that conclusions are based upon factual evidence and their own expert knowledge.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt; In the US, for example, Federal Rules of Evidence state that a qualified expert may testify “in the form of an opinion or otherwise” so long as:

{{quote|(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.&lt;ref name="rule702" /&gt;}}

The sub-branches of digital forensics may each have their own specific guidelines for the conduct of investigations and the handling of evidence. For example, mobile phones may be required to be placed in a [[Faraday cage|Faraday shield]] during seizure or acquisition to prevent further radio traffic to the device. In the UK forensic examination of computers in criminal matters is subject to [[Association of Chief Police Officers|ACPO]] guidelines.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt; There are also international approaches to providing guidance on how to handle electronic evidence. The "Electronic Evidence Guide" by the [[Council of Europe]] offers a framework for law enforcement and judicial authorities in countries who seek to set up or enhance their own guidelines for the identification and handling of electronic evidence.&lt;ref name="EEG" /&gt;

===Investigative tools===

The admissibility of digital evidence relies on the tools used to extract it. In the US, forensic tools are subjected to the [[Daubert standard]], where the judge is responsible for ensuring that the processes and software used were acceptable. In a 2003 paper Brian Carrier argued that the Daubert guidelines required the code of forensic tools to be published and peer reviewed. He concluded that "open source tools may more clearly and comprehensively meet the guideline requirements than would closed
source tools."&lt;ref name="tools-legal" /&gt; In 2011 [[Josh Brunty]] stated that the scientific validation of the technology and software associated with performing a digital forensic examination is critical to any laboratory process.  He argued that "the science of digital forensics is founded on the principles of repeatable processes and quality evidence therefore knowing how to design and properly maintain a good validation process is a key requirement for any digital forensic examiner to defend their methods in court." "&lt;ref name="tools-validation" /&gt;

==Branches==
Digital forensics investigation is not restricted to retrieve data merely from the computer, as laws are breached by the criminals and small digital devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones, flash drives) are now extensively used. Some of these devices have volatile memory while some have non-volatile memory. Sufficient methodologies are available to retrieve data from volatile memory, however, there is lack of detailed methodology or a framework for data retrieval from non-volatile memory sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jansen |first1=Wayne |title=Ayers |website=NIST Special Publication |publisher=NIST |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-72/sp800-72.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212052654/http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-72/sp800-72.pdf |archivedate=12 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the type of devices, media or artifacts, digital forensics investigation is branched into various types.

===Computer forensics===
{{Main|Computer forensics}}

The goal of computer forensics is to explain the current state of a digital artifact; such as a computer system, storage medium or electronic document.&lt;ref name="cf-education"&gt;{{cite web |title= Computer forensics education |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/8013/27399/01219052.pdf?arnumber=1219052 |publisher=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy |accessdate=26 July 2010 |author=A Yasinsac |author2= RF Erbacher |author3= DG Marks |author4= MM Pollitt |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline usually covers computers, [[embedded system]]s (digital devices with rudimentary computing power and onboard memory) and static memory (such as USB pen drives).

Computer forensics can deal with a broad range of information; from logs (such as internet history) through to the actual files on the drive. In 2007 prosecutors used a [[spreadsheet]] recovered from the computer of [[Joseph E. Duncan III]] to show [[Premeditated murder|premeditation]] and secure the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; [[Sharon Lopatka]]'s killer was identified in 2006 after email messages from him detailing torture and death fantasies were found on her computer.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

===Mobile device forensics===
{{Main|Mobile device forensics}}

Mobile device forensics is a sub-branch of digital forensics relating to recovery of digital evidence or data from a [[mobile device]]. It differs from Computer forensics in that a mobile device will have an inbuilt communication system (e.g. [[GSM]]) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications (SMS/Email) rather than in-depth recovery of deleted data.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="maarten-mob" /&gt; [[SMS]] data from a mobile device investigation helped to exonerate Patrick Lumumba in the [[murder of Meredith Kercher]].&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

Mobile devices are also useful for providing location information; either from inbuilt gps/location tracking or via [[cell site]] logs, which track the devices within their range. Such information was used to track down the kidnappers of Thomas Onofri in 2006.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

===Network forensics===
{{Main|Network forensics}}

Network forensics is concerned with the monitoring and analysis of [[computer network]] traffic, both [[Local area network|local]] and [[Wide area network|WAN]]/[[internet]], for the purposes of information gathering, evidence collection, or intrusion detection.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Palmer, A Road Map for Digital Forensic Research, Report from DFRWS 2001, First Digital Forensic Research Workshop, Utica, New York, 7–8 August 2001,  Page(s) 27–30&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic is usually intercepted at the [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] level, and either stored for later analysis or filtered in real-time. Unlike other areas of digital forensics network data is often volatile and rarely logged, making the discipline often reactionary.

In 2000 the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] lured computer hackers Aleksey Ivanov and Gorshkov to the United States for a fake job interview. By monitoring network traffic from the pair's computers, the FBI identified passwords allowing them to collect evidence directly from Russian-based computers.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moscowtimes" /&gt;

===Forensic data analysis===
{{Main|Forensic data analysis}}

Forensic Data Analysis is a branch of digital forensics. It examines structured data with the aim to discover and analyse patterns of fraudulent activities resulting from financial crime.

===Database forensics===
{{Main|Database forensics}}

Database forensics is a branch of digital forensics relating to the forensic study of [[databases]] and their metadata.&lt;ref name="db" /&gt; Investigations use database contents, log files and in-[[Random access memory|RAM]] data to build a timeline or recover relevant information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2252">'''Dipole field strength in free space''', in [[telecommunications]], is the [[electric field strength]] caused by a half wave [[dipole]] under ideal conditions. The actual field strength in terrestrial environments is calculated by empirical formulas based on this field strength.

== Power density ==


Let '''N''' be the effective power radiated from an isotropic antenna and '''p''' be the power density at a distance '''d''' from this source&lt;ref&gt;''Reference data for radio Engineers'', Howard W.Sams co,Indianapolis, 1956, 27-7&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{p} = \frac{N}{4\cdot \pi \cdot d^2}&lt;/math&gt; 

Power density is also defined in terms of electrical field strength;

Let '''E''' be the electrical field and '''R''' be the impedance of the free space

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{p} = \frac{E^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt; 

The following relation is obtained by equating the two,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{N}{4\cdot \pi \cdot d^2}= \frac{E^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt; 

or by rearranging the terms

:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{E} =\frac{\sqrt{N} \cdot\sqrt{R}}{2\cdot \sqrt{\pi}\cdot d}&lt;/math&gt;

== Numerical values ==
[[Impedance of free space]] is roughly &lt;math&gt; 120 \cdot \pi&lt;/math&gt;

Since a [[half wave dipole]] is used, its [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] over an [[isotropic]] [[dipole antenna|antenna]] (&lt;math&gt;\mbox{2.15 dBi} = 1.64&lt;/math&gt; ) should also be taken into consideration,

:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{E} =\frac{\sqrt{1.64 \cdot N} \cdot  \sqrt{ 120\cdot \pi}}{2\cdot \sqrt{\pi}\cdot d} 

 \approx 7\cdot\frac{ \sqrt{N}}{d}&lt;/math&gt; 

In this equation [[SI units]] are used.

Expressing the same equation in:
: '''kW''' instead of '''W''' in [[power (physics)|power]], 
:'''km''' instead of '''m''' in [[distance]] and 
:'''mV/m''' instead of '''V/m''' in [[electric field]] 

is equivalent to multiplying the expression on the right by &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{1000}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt; K.H.Kaltbeitzer: ''Site selection'', EBU Techhnical Monograph 3104,Bruxelles,1965, p  30 &lt;/ref&gt; In this case,

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{E} \approx 222\cdot\frac{\sqrt{N}}{d} &lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;/div&gt;

{{Contains Tibetan text}}
'''Dzong architecture''' is a distinctive type of fortress ({{bo|w=rdzong}}, {{IPA-all|tz&lt;sup&gt;ɦ&lt;/sup&gt;oŋ˩˨}}) [[architectural style|architecture]] found mainly in [[Bhutan]] and [[Tibet]]. The architecture is massive in style with towering exterior walls surrounding a complex of [[courtyard]]s, temples, administrative offices, and monks' accommodation.

==Characteristics==
Distinctive features include:
* High inward sloping walls of brick and stone painted white with few or no windows in the lower sections of the wall
* Use of a surrounding red ochre stripe near the top of the walls, sometimes punctuated by large gold circles.
* Use of unique style flared roofs atop interior temples.
* Massive entry doors made of wood and iron
* Interior courtyards and temples brightly colored in Buddhist-themed art [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] such as the [[ashtamangala]] or [[swastika]], for example.

==Regional differences==

===Bhutan===
{{See also|History of Bhutan}}
Dzongs serve as the religious, military, administrative, and social centers of their district. They are often the site of an annual ''[[tsechu]]'' or religious festival.

The rooms inside the dzong are typically allocated half to administrative function (such as the office of the ''[[penlop]]'' or governor), and half to religious function, primarily the temple and housing for monks. This division between administrative and religious functions reflects the idealized [[dual system of government|duality of power]] between the religious and administrative branches of government.

===Tibet===
{{Further|List of administrative divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region}}
Tibet used to be divided into 53 prefecture districts also called ''dzongs''.&lt;ref name=Tibet&gt;''Le Tibet'', Marc Moniez, Christian Deweirdt, Monique Masse, Éditions de l'Adret, Paris, 1999, {{ISBN|2-907629-46-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two [[dzongpen|dzongpöns]] for each dzong, a [[lama]] and a layman. They were entrusted with both civil and military powers and are equal in all respects, though subordinate to the generals and the Chinese [[amban]] in military matters,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarat Chandra Das|Das, Sarat Chandra]]. (1902). ''Lhasa and Central Tibet''. Reprint (1988): Mehra Offset Press, Delhi, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; until the expulsion of the ambans following the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=Tibet/&gt; Today, 71 [[List of administrative divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region|counties]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] are called ''dzong''s in the [[Tibetic languages]].

==Siting of dzongs==
[[Image:TrongsaDzong.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Trongsa Dzong]], the largest dzong fortress in [[Bhutan]].]]
Bhutanese dzong architecture reached its zenith in the 17th century under the leadership of [[Ngawang Namgyal]], the 1st [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]]. The Zhabdrung relied on visions and omens to site each of the dzongs. Modern military strategists would observe that the dzongs are well-sited with regard to their function as defensive fortresses. [[Wangdue Phodrang]] dzong, for instance, is set upon a spur overlooking the confluence of the [[Sankosh River|Sankosh]] (Puna Tsang) and [[Tang Chuu|Tang]] Rivers, thus blocking any attacks by southern invaders who attempted to use a river route to bypass the trackless slopes of the middle Himalayas in attacking central Bhutan. [[Drukgyel]] Dzong at the head of the [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] valley guards the traditional [[Tibet]]an invasion path over the passes of the high Himalayas.
[[Image:Wangdue Phodrang Dzong.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Dzong at [[Wangdue Phodrang]], Bhutan.]]
Dzongs were frequently built on a hilltop or mountain spur. If the dzong is built on the side of a valley wall, a smaller dzong or watchtower is typically built directly uphill from the main dzong with the purpose of keeping the slope clear of attackers who might otherwise shoot downward into the courtyard of the main dzong below (see image at head of article).

[[Punakha Dzong]] is distinctive in that it is sited on a relatively flat spit of land at the confluence of the [[Mo Chhu|Mo]] and [[Pho Chhu|Pho]] Rivers. The rivers surround the dzong on three sides, providing protection from attack. This siting proved inauspicious, however, when in 1994 a glacial lake 90 kilometers upstream burst through its [[Ice jam|ice dam]] to cause a massive flood on the Pho Chhu, damaging the dzong and taking 23 lives.

==Construction==
[[Image:Bhutan architecture dzong roof.jpg|thumb|upright|Roof construction at Tongsa dzong.]]
By tradition, dzongs are constructed without the use of architectural plans. Instead construction proceeds under the direction of a high [[lama]] who establishes each dimension by means of spiritual inspiration.

In previous times the dzongs were built using [[corvée]] labor which was applied as a tax against each household in the district. Under this obligation each family was to provide or hire a decreed number of workers to work for several months at a time (during quiet periods in the agricultural year) in the construction of the dzong.

Dzongs comprise heavy [[masonry]] curtain walls surrounding one or more courtyards. The main functional spaces are usually arranged in two separate areas: the administrative offices; and the religious functions - including temples and monks' accommodation. This accommodation is arranged along the inside of the outer walls and often as a separate stone tower located centrally within the courtyard, housing the main temple, that can be used as an inner defensible citadel. The main internal structures are again built with stone (or as in domestic architecture by rammed clay blocks), and whitewashed inside and out, with a broad red [[ochre]] band at the top on the outside. The larger spaces such as the temple have massive internal timber columns and beams to create galleries around an open central full height area. Smaller structures are of elaborately carved and painted timber construction.

The roofs are massively constructed in [[hardwood]] and [[bamboo]], highly decorated at the [[eaves]], and are constructed traditionally without the use of nails. They are open at the eaves to provide a ventilated storage area. They were traditionally finished with timber [[Roof shingle|shingle]]s weighted down with stones; but in almost all cases this has now been replaced with [[corrugated galvanised iron]] roofing. The roof of Tongsa Dzong, illustrated, is one of the few shingle roofs to survive and was being restored in 2006/7.

The courtyards, usually stone-flagged, are generally at a higher level than the outside and approached by massive staircases and narrow defensible entrances with large wooden doors. All doors have thresholds to discourage the entrance of spirits. Temples are usually set at a level above the courtyard with further staircases up to them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Modern architecture in the dzong style==
Larger modern buildings in Bhutan often use the form and many of the external characteristics of dzong architecture in their construction, although incorporating modern techniques such as a concrete frame.

===University of Texas at El Paso===
The campus architecture of the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] (UTEP) is a rare example of dzong style seen outside the Himalayas. Initial phases were designed by El Paso architect [[Trost &amp; Trost|Henry Trost]], and later phases have continued in the same style.&lt;ref&gt;For more details see the ''[http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?PageContentMode=1&amp;tabid=30289 UTEP Handbook of Operations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210043029/http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?PageContentMode=1&amp;tabid=30289 |date=2012-02-10 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==UNESCO Tentative Listing==
In 2012, the Butanese government listed five dzongs to its tentative list for [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] inscription in the future. The five dzongs are Punakha Dzong, Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, Paro Dzong, Trongsa Dzong and Dagana Dzong.&lt;ref&gt;https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5695/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoHealth''' is an emerging field of study researching how changes in the earth’s [[ecosystems]] affect human health. It has many prospects. EcoHealth examines changes in the biological, physical, social and economic environments and relates these changes to human health. Examples of these changes and their effects abound. Common examples include increases in [[asthma]] rates due to [[air pollution]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] contamination of [[game fish]] in the [[Great Lakes]] of the [[United States]], and [[habitat fragmentation]] leading to increasing rates of [[Lyme disease]].

Recently [[virulent]] new [[infectious diseases]] such as [[SARS]], [[Ebola virus]], [[Nipah virus]], [[H5N1|bird flu]] and [[hantavirus]] have all been found to result from ecosystem change created by humans.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} These diseases have high death rates and very few effective therapies.

EcoHealth is bringing together [[physicians]], [[veterinarians]], [[ecologists]], [[economists]], [[social scientists]], [[urban planner|planners]] and others to study and understand how ecosystem changes affect human health. EcoHealth strives to provide innovative, practical solutions to reduce or reverse the negative health effects of ecosystem change.

==History==

Ecosystem approaches to health, or ecohealth, emerged as a defined field of inquiry and application in the 1990s, primarily through the global research supported by the [[International Development Research Centre]] in Ottawa (IDRC), Canada (Lebel, 2003). However, this was a resurrection of an approach to health and ecology that can be traced back, in Western societies, to [[Hippocrates]], and to much earlier eras in Eastern societies. The approach was prominent among many scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries, but fell into disfavour in the twentieth century, when technical professionalism and expertise were assumed to be sufficient to deal with health and disease. In this relatively brief era, evaluation of the negative human health impacts of environmental change (both the natural and built environment) was allotted to the fields of medicine and environmental health. One medicine, as championed by scholars and practitioners such as Calvin Schwabe, was largely considered a marginal activity.

Integrated approaches to health and ecology re-emerged in the 1990s, and included one health, conservation medicine, ecological resilience, ecological integrity, health communities, and a variety of other approaches. These new movements were able to draw on a tradition that stretches from Hippocrates, to [[Rudolf Virchow]] and [[Louis Pasteur]], who did not recognize the boundaries between human and animal medicine, and environmental and social change; to William Osler, who was a member of both the [[McGill University Faculty of Medicine|McGill medical faculty]] and the [[Université de Montréal Faculty of Veterinary Medicine|Montreal Veterinary College]]; Calvin Schwabe, whose 1984 book, Veterinary Medicine and Human Health, is a classic in the field; and [[James Harlan Steele|James Steele]], who founded the first veterinary public health unit in the United States.

Ecohealth approaches as currently practiced are participatory, systems-based approaches to understanding and promoting health and wellbeing in the context of social and ecological interactions. What differentiates these approaches from earlier integrative attempts is a firm grounding in complexity theories and post-normal science (Waltner-Toews, 2004; Waltner-Toews ''et al.'', 2008). While a variety of organizations promote integrative approaches such as One Health, the primary funder and promoter of ecohealth in particular, world-wide, is the International Development Research Centre in Ottawa (http://www.idrc.ca/ecohealth/).

After a decade of international conferences in North America and Australia under the more contentious umbrella of "[[ecosystem health]]", the first "ecosystem approach to human health" (ecohealth) forum was held in Montreal in 2003, followed by conferences and forums in Wisconsin, U.S., and Mérida, Mexico, all with major support from IDRC. Since then the International Association for Ecology and Health, and the journal Ecohealth have established the field as a legitimate scholarly and development activity (www.ecohealth.net).

==Differences==

EcoHealth studies differ from traditional, single discipline studies. A traditional epidemiological study may show increasing rates of malaria in a region, but not address how or why the rate is increasing. An environmental health study may recommend the spraying of a pesticide in certain amounts in certain areas to reduce spread. An economic analysis may calculate the cost and effectiveness per dollar spent on such a program.
An EcoHealth study uses a different approach. It brings the multiple specialist disciplines together with members of the affected community before the study begins. Through pre-study meetings the group shares knowledge and adopts a common language. These pre-study meetings often lead to creative and novel approaches and can lead to a more "socially robust" solution. EcoHealth practitioners term this synergy transdisciplinarity, and differentiate it from multidiscipline studies.
EcoHealth studies also value participation of all involved groups, including decision makers and believe issues of equity (between gender, socioeconomic classes, age and even species) are important to fully understand the problem to be studied.
Jean Lebel (2003) phrased ''transdisciplinarity, participation and equity the three pillars of EcoHealth'' (Lebel, 2003). 
The IDRC now speaks of six principles, instead of three pillars, namely transdisciplinarity, participation, gender and social equity, system-thinking, sustainability and research-to-action (Charron, 2011).

==Examples==

A short example of a transdisciplinary study in the field of EcoHealth appears below. This is excerpted from HEALTH: An Ecosystem Approach, by Jean Lebel. (IDRC 2003, {{ISBN|1-55250-012-8}}.)
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“In Mexico in the 1940s and 1950s, close to 24 000 of the 2.4 million people who caught malaria every year died as a result. Massive use of the powerful insecticide DDT was the linchpin of the government's effort to eradicate the disease. Over time, some progress was made against malaria, but the war was far from won. The use of DDT also posed its own threats to the health of the ecosystem. Moreover, as required by the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico had to completely eliminate the use of DDT by 2002.
To meet this challenge, an EcoHealth research project was set up to pool the knowledge of a team of specialists in epidemiology, computer science, entomology, and social sciences, from both government and academia.
This team has accumulated volumes of information about the prevalence of malaria in 2 000 villages. Data from powerful geographical information systems enabled them to conclude that mosquitoes do not travel very much. "If you have a place to lay your eggs and feed yourself, why go elsewhere?" explains Mario Henry Rodriguez, Director of Research on Infectious Diseases at the National Institute for Public Health (NIPH). In addition, as confirmed by Juan Eugenio Hernández, NIPH's Director of Informatics, it is now believed that "human beings are the vectors of malaria," which explains why more cases of malaria are found in villages located alongside roads.”
With community help, the team studied the population's living conditions, including behavioural differences between men and women. It was found that while women are more likely to be bitten by mosquitoes early in the morning when they go to fetch water, the men are likely to be bitten in the coffee plantations at night.
Several preventive actions have been taken. The scientists have proposed a new insecticide that, unlike DDT, does not persist in the environment. They have also developed a more effective pump that can spray 40 homes a day instead of 8, and uses less insecticide. A new malaria testing kit now detects the presence or absence of parasites in a patient's blood in only a few minutes, unlike laboratory tests that take three to four weeks to confirm a diagnosis. Previously, the need to wait for test results forced the authorities to treat everyone who showed vague symptoms of the illness, such as a high fever or headaches. Now, volunteers administer these tests to the people in close to 60 villages. "We have given communities the means to take care of themselves," says Mario Rodriguez.
The fight against malaria in Mexico is now no longer solely the responsibility of government employees. Women also play a role by removing, every two weeks, the algae that harbour mosquito larvae in bodies of water. As a result, the number of cases of malaria in the state of Oaxaca has dropped from 15 000 in 1998 to only 400 today — and all without using any DDT. "Our experience has taught us that we need to bolster the social science research component if we want to extend this program to other parts of the country, while maintaining it in Oaxaca. The challenge is to draw the lessons that will lead to application of the program on a much wider scale," says Dr Rodriguez.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This study reveals both the nature of the complex interactions of the problem and the extent to which a successful solution must cross research disciplines. The solution involved creative thinking on the part of many individuals, and produced a win-win situation for researchers, business and most importantly, for the community. 
Although many of the dramatic effects of ecosystem change and much of the research is focused in developing countries, the ecosystem of the built environment in urban areas of the developed world is also a major determinant of human health. Obesity, diabetes, asthma, and heart disease are all directly related to how humans interact with the local [[urban ecosystem]] in which they live. Urban design and planning determine car use, food choices available, air pollution levels and the safety and walkability of the neighborhoods in which people live.
Other examples of the EcoHealth approach can be found in Linking Social and Ecological Systems: Management Practice and Social Mechanisms for Building Resilience, edited by Fikrit Berkes and Carl Folke (1998, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-59140-6}}) and Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems, edited by Lance H. Gunderson and C. S. Holling (2002, Island Press, {{ISBN|1-55963-856-7}}).

==EcoHealth 101: education for ecosystem approaches==

Courses in ecosystem approaches to health have been developed and delivered in several [[North America]]n and [[Australia]]n universities. One innovative Canadian course involved a collaboration of all of Canada's veterinary colleges, and focused on integrative field cases in all parts of the country; another Canadian course was a joint effort of the medical school at the University of Western Ontario and the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph. In the years after 2003, communities of practice for ecosystem approaches to health in [[Canada]], Latin America and the Caribbean, and [[Africa]] (largely supported by the IDRC) created intensive graduate level courses that integrated systems approaches with participatory approaches, and used actual case studies so that students gained applied clinical experience in "transdisciplinary" problem solving (see www.copeh-canada.org for one example). CoPEH-Canada organizes a yearly professional development and graduate level intensive training course in ecosystem approaches to health and have created a teaching manual with much of their material which is free on their site in English, French and Spanish (www.copeh-canada.org).

Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the University of Wisconsin–Madison created a website to promote education in this area [http://www.ecohealth101.org EcoHealth (Environmental Change and Our Health)]. The website examines the changes that are transforming Earth and what they can mean for our health.

This website is geared to middle-school students and their teachers, and delivers scientific information in a kid-friendly, engaging, and visually vibrant manner. Since its initial partnership with the Journey to Planet Earth television mini-series, hosted and narrated by actor Matt Damon and aired on PBS in Spring 2003 and 2004, the website has become an educational complement to this [[television|TV]] series, as well as a dynamic stand-alone tool for students and teachers. Since then, the site's appeal has grown far broader, reaching high-school students, and anyone interested in environmental and health issues—or simply wanting a reliable and fun resource for being able to sort the science from the sound bites. [http://www.ecohealth101.org EcoHealth 101] provides the in-depth analysis and context behind today's headline news.

"The idea for the site grew from the positive feedback following public lectures I've given on global environmental health", says Dr. Jonathan Patz, associate professor at the University of Wisconsin &amp; adjunct associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "'Students should really learn about how their health is tied so closely to the global environment,' was the comment I often heard."

"The site is very exciting because it deals with serious and thought-provoking topics", adds Dr. Patz. "Nonetheless, it shows middle-school students how to have fun with the visual elements and discover what potential solutions exist for alleviating the negative effects of climate change and other changes to our planet."

In a rapidly changing world, our school curriculum must expand to include accurate science on global warming, environmental degradation, and its negative effects on human, wildlife and [[ecosystem health]]. The mission of [http://www.ecohealth101.org EcoHealth 101] is to educate and inform the next generation of leaders who may have the answers to today's problems. Chapters from the website include Global Warming, Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, The Balance of Nature, Modern Agriculture and Drinking Water, and Globalization and Disease Without Borders.

The site was reviewed for accuracy and fairness by science, health, and environmental experts in a wide range of specialties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17510">'''Ecopsychology''' studies the relationship between human beings and the natural world through [[ecology|ecological]] and [[psychology|psychological]] principles.&lt;ref name="And"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=G.|title=About eco-psychology.|url=http://www.eco-psychology.com/pages/about_ecopsychology.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field seeks to develop and understand ways of expanding the emotional connection between individuals and the natural world, thereby assisting individuals with developing sustainable lifestyles and remedying alienation from nature. [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]] is credited with coining the term in his 1992 book, ''The Voice of the Earth,'' although a group of psychologists and environmentalists in Berkeley, including Mary Gomes and Allen Kanner, were independently using the term to describe their own work at the same time. Roszak, Gomes and Kanner later expanded the idea in the 1995 anthology ''Ecopsychology.'' Two other books were especially formative for the field, [[Paul Shepard]]'s 1982 volume, "Nature and Madness," which explored the effect that our ever-diminishing engagement with wild nature had upon human psychological development, and philosopher [[David Abram]]'s ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World,'' published in 1996. The latter was the first widely read book to bring phenomenology to bear on ecological and ecopsychological issues, examining in detail the earthly dimensions of sensory experience, and disclosing the historical effect of formal writing systems upon the human experience of nature's agency, voice, and interiority.

A central premise of ecopsychology is that while today the human mind is affected and shaped by the modern social world, its deep structure is inevitably adapted to, and informed by, the more-than-human natural environment in which it evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roszak|first=Theodore|title=A new therapy [Letter to the editor]|journal=BioScience|year=1995|volume=45|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.2307/1312526}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[biophilia hypothesis]] of biologist [[E.O. Wilson]], human beings have an innate instinct to connect emotionally with nature,&lt;ref name="The" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=E. O.,|title=The Biophilia Hypothesis|year=1995|publisher=Island Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the aspects of nature that recall what evolutionary psychologists have termed the [[Evolutionary psychology#Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment of evolutionary adaptiveness]], the natural conditions that the [[human species]] evolved to inhabit.

The field of ecopsychology extends beyond the conventional purview of psychology, which had traditionally considered the psyche to be a matter of relevance to humans alone. Ecopsychology examines why people continue environmentally damaging behaviour, and to develop methods of positive motivation for adopting sustainable practices.&lt;ref name="The"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roszack|first=Theodore|title=The nature of sanity|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199601/the-nature-sanity|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that many environmentally damaging behaviours are addictive at some level, and thus are more effectively addressed through positive emotional fulfillment rather than by inflicting shame. Other names used to refer to ecopsychology include depth ecology, Gaia psychology,&lt;ref name="Gai"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaia Psychology|url=http://www.gaiapsychology.org/|publisher=Gaia Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychoecology, ecotherapy, [[environmental psychology]], green psychology, [[transpersonal ecology]], global therapy, green therapy, Earth-centered therapy, reearthing, nature-based psychotherapy, shamanic counselling, [[ecosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schroll|first=M. A.|author2=Walker, H.|title=Diagnosing the human superiority complex: Providing evidence the eco-crisis is born of conscious agency [Abstract]|journal=Anthropology of Consciousness|year=2011|volume=22|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sylvan therapy.

==Practical benefits==

Certain researchers propose that an individual's connection to nature can improve their interpersonal relationships and emotional wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Gai" /&gt; An integral part of this practice is to remove [[psychotherapy]], and the individual, from the interior of office buildings and homes and place them outdoors.&lt;ref name="The" /&gt; According to the precepts of ecopsychology, a walk in the woods or a city park is refreshing because it is what humans evolved to do. Psychologists such as Roger Ulrich, Rachel and Stephen Kaplan, Frances Kuo and others have studied the beneficial effects of inhabiting natural settings and of looking at pictures of landscapes on the human psyche. [[Richard Louv]]'s ''[[Last Child in the Woods]]: Saving our Children from [[Nature deficit disorder|Nature-Deficit Disorder]]'' discusses in detail how the exposure of children to nature can assist in treating mental disorders, including [[attention deficit disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levine|first=James|title=Product Review|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-56512-391-5|publisher=Reed Business Information|accessdate=March 8, 2012|format=Review of book Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder|date=May 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community psychologist [[Guy Holmes (psychologist)|Guy Holmes]]' Walk and Talk groups have helped people with serious mental health diagnoses alongside other members of the general public to access the benefits of walking in green spaces in UK towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychology in the Real World: Community-based group work|last=Holmes|first=G.|publisher=PCCS|year=2010|isbn=978-1-906254131|location=Ross-on-Wye|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardening is one way to experience the practical benefits of connecting with nature, particularly in the contexts of stress reduction, restoration, and awareness. Initial experimental research about stress-relieving effects showed subjects who gardened after situations of acute stress were able to fully recover from the event and their cortisol level measurements indicated positive mood increases after gardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Den Berg|first=Agnes|last2=Custers|first2=Mariëtte|date=|title=Gardening Promotes Neuroendocrine and Affective Restoration from Stress|url=|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=16|issue=1|pages=3-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological benefits of interactions with nature appear intensified at a smaller, more compressed scale in gardens, offering an accessible, fast-paced view of plant life cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Rachel|date=|title=Some Psychological Benefits of Gardening|url=|journal=Environment and Behavior|volume=5|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the practice of domestic gardening can improve sense of [[self-efficacy]] across ages, particularly among the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milligan|first=Christine|last2=Gatrell|first2=Anthony|last3=Bingley|first3=Amanda|date=|title=‘Cultivating health’: therapeutic landscapes and older people in northern England|url=|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=58|issue=9|pages=1781-1793|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists are also interested in the ways plants influence attention and healing. Plants are attributed as sources of positive distraction, shifting the focus from sensations of discomfort to aesthetic properties of plants, which creates perceived alleviation of pain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grinde|first=Bjørn|last2=Patil|first2=Grete Grindal|date=|title=Biophilia: Does Visual Contact with Nature Impact on Health and Well-Being?|url=|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=6|issue=9|pages=2332-43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have the opportunity to reconnect with nature through horticultural practices and in the wilderness can restore perceived sense of social connection, joy, and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Paul|date=|title=Embedment in the environment: A new paradigm for well-being?|url=|journal=Perspectives in Public Health|volume=130|issue=6|pages=265-269|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interacting with nature is a practical preventative measure against mental-health issues that stem from [[Rumination (psychology)|rumination]]. When a group of participants in one study went on a walk in nature they expressed lower levels of rumination and showed diminished neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex, an area tied to mental illness, while participants who walked through urban settings experienced no changes in either respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bratman|first=Gregory|last2=Hamilton|first2=J. Paul|last3=Hahn|first3=Kevin|last4=Daily|first4=Gretchen|last5=Gross|first5=James|date=|editor5-first=|title=Nature experience reduces rumination and subgenual prefrontal cortex activation|url=|journal=National Academy of Sciences|volume=112|issue=28|pages=8567-8572|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another premise of ecopsychology is that steps taken to accept and notice nature can sharpen the senses and help people cultivate new skills. For example, the ability to track and navigate through a wilderness is improved if nature is noticed and accepted rather than feared. Similarly, ecopsychology proposes that sailors who appreciate the sea gain a keen sense for breeze directions. Psychologists have explored how senses subtly influence the brain in natural environments and impact a person's subjective well-being. Plants in the visual sphere affect the brain whether or not they are the object of focus and the blue and green hues of nature may contribute to low-anxiety psychological states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franco|first=Lara|last2=Shanahan|first2=Danielle|last3=Fuller|first3=Richard|date=|title=A Review of the Benefits of Nature Experiences: More Than Meets the Eye|url=|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=14|issue=8|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons to embrace nature==

Ecopsychology explores how to develop emotional bonds with [[nature]].&lt;ref name="And" /&gt; It considers this to be worthwhile because when nature is explored and viewed without judgement, it gives the sensations of harmony, balance, timelessness and stability. Ecopsychology largely rejects [[reductionist]] views of nature that focus upon rudimentary building blocks such as [[genes]], and that describe nature as selfish and a struggle to survive. Ecopsychology considers that there has been insufficient scientific description and exploration of nature, in terms of [[wildness]], [[Occam's razor|parsimony]], [[spirituality]] and emotional ties. For example, parsimony is the best way to produce an evolutionary tree of the species ([[cladistics]]), suggesting that parsimonious adaptations are selected. Yet today, the brain is often seen as complicated and governed by inherited mind modules, rather than being a simple organ that looks for parsimony within the influences of its surroundings, resulting in the compaction in minds of a great diversity of concepts.

==Cultures that embrace nature==

In its exploration of how to bond with nature, ecopsychology is interested in the examples provided by a wide variety of ancient and modern cultures that have histories of embracing nature. Examples include [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]], [[pagan]], [[Jain]], [[Buddhist]], and [[Hindu]] cultures, as well as [[shamanism]] and the more recent [[hesychast]] tradition. Of interest is how identity becomes entwined with nature, so that loss of those sacred places is far more devastating to indigenous people than often understood. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] stories, in particular, illustrate a socially recognized sense of community between humans and the natural landscape.&lt;ref name=Out&gt;{{cite book|last=Hillard|first=H. J.|title=Review|year=2009|publisher=MELUS|pages=194–196|accessdate=March 8, 2012|format=Review of the book Out of the Shadow: Ecopsychology, Story, and Encounters With the Land}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Māori people|Māori]] philosophy, and practice of kaitiakitanga, or eco-guardianship, and preservation emphasizes a deep connect between humans, and their environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/kaitiakitanga-guardianship-and-conservation/page-1 Te Ara Encycolopedia - Understanding kaitiakitanga]&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Orthodox monks led a contemplative life deeply intertwined with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ongal.bg/en/hesychast.html Bulgarian Hesychasts]&lt;/ref&gt; Other lessons include how to live sustainably within an environment and the self-sacrifices made to tolerate natural limits, such as population control or a nomadic existence that allows the environment to regenerate. Moreover, certain indigenous cultures have developed methods of psychotherapy involving the presence of trees, rivers, and astronomical bodies.&lt;ref name="The" /&gt;

==Pain and delusions without nature==

Ecopsychologists have begun detecting unspoken grief within individuals, an escalation of pain and despair, felt in response to widespread environmental destruction. The field of ecopsychology intends to illustrate how environmental disconnection functions as an aspect of existing [[pathology|pathologies]], without creating a new category. The contention is that if a culture is disconnected from nature, then various aspects of an individual's life will be negatively impacted.&lt;ref name="The" /&gt; It also believes that without the influence of nature, humans are prone to a variety of delusions, and that to some degree life in the wild forms the basis for human sanity and optimal psychological development. The topic is explored in detail [[Paul Shepard]]'s book ''Nature and Madness''. It is also proposed that separation from outdoor contact causes a loss of sensory and information-processing ability that was developed over the course of human evolution, which was spent in direct reciprocity with the environment.&lt;ref name="Gai" /&gt;

A '''fact''' is something that is consistent with objective [[reality]] or that can be proven with [[evidence]]. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability — that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to [[experience]]. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. [[Science|Scientific]] facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by [[experiments]] or other means.

== Etymology and usage ==
The word "fact" derives from the Latin ''factum'', and was first used in English with the same meaning: ''a thing done or performed'' a meaning now obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact". OED_2d_Ed_1989, (but note the conventional uses: ''after the fact'' and ''before the fact'').&lt;/ref&gt;  The common usage of "something that has really occurred or is the case" dates from the middle of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (1a). OED_2d_Ed_1989 Joye ''Exp. Dan.'' xi. Z vij b, ''Let emprours and kinges know this godly kynges fact. 1545''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact is sometimes used synonymously with ''[[truth]]'', as distinct from opinions, falsehoods, or matters of taste.  This use is found in such phrases as, "''It is a fact that the cup is blue"'' or "''Matter of fact"'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (4a) OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; and "...&amp;nbsp;not history, nor fact, but imagination." Filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] distinguishes between the two, claiming that "Fact creates norms, and truth illumination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |title=Werner Herzog Film: Statements / Texts |publisher=Wernerherzog.com |date=1999-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715011254/http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact also indicates a ''matter under discussion'' deemed to be true or correct, such as to emphasize a point or prove a disputed issue; (e.g., "...&amp;nbsp;the ''fact'' of the matter is ...").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6c). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(See also "Matter" (2,6). Compact_OED)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, ''fact'' may also indicate an ''allegation or stipulation'' of something that may or may not be a ''true fact'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (5). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., "the author's facts are not trustworthy"). This alternate usage, although contested by some, has a long history in standard English.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', "Fact has a long history of usage in the sense 'allegation'" AHD_4th_Ed. The OED dates this use to 1729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact may also indicate findings derived through a ''process of evaluation'', including review of testimony, direct observation, or otherwise; as distinguishable from matters of inference or speculation.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6a). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; This use is reflected in the terms "fact-find" and "fact-finder" (e.g., "set up a [[fact-finding]] commission").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (8). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be checked by reason, experiment, personal experience, or may be argued from authority.  [[Roger Bacon]] wrote "If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Bacon, translated by Robert Burke ''Opus Majus'', Book I, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==

In [[philosophy]], the concept ''fact'' is considered in [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]. Questions of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and truth are closely associated with questions of fact. A "fact" can be defined as something that is the case—that is, a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;"A fact, it might be said, is a state of affairs that is the case or obtains." – [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/states-of-affairs/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. ''States of Affairs'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Wittgenstein, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]],'' Proposition 2: What is the case -- a fact -- is the existence of states of affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be understood as information that makes a true sentence true.&lt;ref&gt;"A fact is, traditionally, the worldly correlate of a true proposition, a state of affairs whose obtaining makes that proposition true." – ''Fact'' in The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Facts may also be understood as those things to which a true sentence refers. The statement "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system" is ''about'' the fact Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Oliver, ''Fact'', in {{cite book
| title     = Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy
| first     = Edward
| last      = Craig
| publisher = Routledge, Oxford
| year      = 2005
| isbn        = 0-415-32495-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correspondence and the slingshot argument===

[[Pascal Engel|Pascal Engel's]] version of the [[correspondence theory of truth]] explains that what makes a sentence true is that it ''corresponds'' to a fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Truth
| first     = Pascal
| last      = Engel
| publisher = McGill-Queen's Press- MQUP
| year      = 2002
| isbn        = 0-7735-2462-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory presupposes the existence of an objective world.

The [[Slingshot argument]] claims to show that all true statements stand for the same thing - the [[truth value]] ''true''. If this argument holds, and facts are taken to be what true statements stand for, then we reach the counter-intuitive conclusion that there is only one fact - ''the truth''.&lt;ref&gt;The argument is presented in many places, but see for example [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], ''Truth and Meaning'', in {{cite book
| title     = Truth and Interpretation
| first     = Donald
| last      = Davidson
| publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford
| year      = 1984
| isbn        = 0-19-824617-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compound facts===

Any non-trivial true statement about [[reality]] is necessarily an abstraction composed of a complex of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] and [[property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[logic of relatives|relations]].&lt;ref&gt;"Facts possess internal structure, being complexes of objects and properties or relations" Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the fact described by the true statement "[[Paris]] is the capital city of [[France]]" implies that there is such a place as Paris, there is such a place as France, there are such things as capital cities, as well as that France has a government, that the government of France has the power to define its capital city, and that the French government has chosen Paris to be the capital, that there is such a thing as a ''place'' or a ''government'', and so on.  The verifiable accuracy of all of these assertions, if facts themselves, may coincide to create the fact that Paris is the capital of France.

Difficulties arise, however, in attempting to identify the constituent parts of negative, modal, disjunctive, or moral facts.&lt;ref&gt;''Fact'', in ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Ted Honderich, editor. (Oxford, 1995) {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fact–value distinction===
{{main|Fact–value distinction}}
Moral philosophers since [[David Hume#Ethics|David Hume]] have debated whether values are objective, and thus factual. In ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' Hume pointed out there is no obvious way for a series of statements about what ''ought'' to be the case to be derived from a series of statements of what ''is'' the case. Those who insist there is a logical gulf between [[Fact-value distinction|facts and values]], such that it is fallacious to attempt to derive values from facts, include [[G. E. Moore]], who called attempting to do so the [[naturalistic fallacy]].

===Factual–counterfactual distinction===
{{main|Counterfactual conditional}}

Factuality—what has occurred—can also be contrasted with counterfactuality:
what ''might have'' occurred, but did not. A counterfactual conditional or subjunctive conditional is a conditional (or "if-then") statement indicating what ''would be'' the case if events had been other than they were. For example, "If Alexander had lived, his empire would have been greater than Rome." This contrasts with an indicative conditional, which indicates what ''is'' (in fact) the case if its antecedent ''is'' (in fact) true—for example, "If you drink this, it will make you well."

Such sentences are important to [[modal logic]], especially since the development of [[possible world]] semantics.

==In science==
{{further|scientific method|philosophy of science}}

In science, a ''fact'' is a repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experimentation or other means), also called [[empirical evidence]].  Facts are central to building [[scientific theories]].  Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the [[scientific method]], and the scope and validity of [[Philosophy of science|scientific reasoning]].

In the most basic sense, a scientific ''fact'' is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a ''[[hypothesis]]'' or ''[[theory]]'', which is intended to explain or interpret facts.&lt;ref name="Gower000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Method: A Historical and Philosophical Introduction
| first     = Barry
| last      = Gower
| publisher = Routledge
| year      = 1997
| isbn        = 0-415-12282-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[scholars]] have offered significant refinements to this basic formulation.  Scientists are careful to distinguish between: 1) ''states of affairs'' in the external world and 2) ''assertions'' of fact that may be considered relevant in scientific analysis. The term is used in both senses in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Ravetz000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems
| first     = Jerome Raymond
| last      = Ravetz
| publisher = Transaction Publishers
| year      = 1996
| isbn        = 1-56000-851-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and clinical researchers in both the social and natural sciences have written about numerous questions and theories that arise in the attempt to clarify the fundamental nature of scientific fact.&lt;ref&gt;(Gower 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Pertinent issues raised by this inquiry include:
* the process by which "established fact" becomes recognized and accepted as such;&lt;ref&gt;(see e.g., Ravetz, p. 182 fn. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* whether and to what extent "fact" and "theoretic explanation" can be considered truly independent and separable from one another;&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"&gt;Gower, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;
* to what extent "facts" are influenced by the mere act of observation;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"/&gt; and
* to what extent factual conclusions are influenced by history and consensus, rather than a strictly systematic methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with the idea of [[confirmation holism]], some scholars assert "fact" to be necessarily "theory-laden" to some degree. [[Thomas Kuhn]] points out that knowing what facts to measure, and how to measure them, requires the use of other theories. For example, the age of [[fossils]] is based on [[radiometric dating]], which is justified by reasoning that radioactive decay follows a [[Poisson process]] rather than a [[Bernoulli process]]. Similarly, [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] is credited with the methodological position known as operationalism, which asserts that all observations are not only influenced, but necessarily defined by the means and assumptions used to measure them.

=== The scientific method ===
Apart from the fundamental inquiry into the nature of scientific fact, there remain the practical and social considerations of how fact is investigated, established, and substantiated through the proper application of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz p. 181 et. seq. (Chapter Six: "Facts and their evolution")&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific facts are generally believed independent of the observer: no matter who performs a scientific experiment, all observers agree on the outcome.&lt;ref name="The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine"&gt;Cassell, Eric J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1kjFYrliTMC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;ots=3V6-UmUFmP&amp;dq=%22scientific+fact&amp;sig=YtQTgNbisFSQ1QfV-JNkmW7D0n4#PPA181,M1 The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine] ''[[Oxford University Press]]''. Retrieved 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to these considerations, there are the social and institutional measures, such as peer review and accreditation, that are intended to promote ''factual accuracy'' (among other interests) in scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;(Ravetz 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In history ==
{{further|Historiography}}

A common rhetorical cliché states, "[[History is written by the winners]]." This phrase suggests but does not examine the use of facts in the writing of history.

[[E. H. Carr]] in his 1961 volume ''[[What is History?]]'' argues that the inherent biases from the gathering of facts makes the objective truth of any historical [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] [[idealistic]] and impossible. Facts are, "like fish in the Ocean," of which we may only happen to catch a few, only an indication of what is below the surface. Even a dragnet cannot tell us for certain what it would be like to live below the Ocean's surface. Even if we do not discard any facts (or fish) presented, we will always miss the majority; the site of our fishing, the methods undertaken, the weather and even luck play a vital role in what we will catch. Additionally, the composition of history is inevitably made up by the compilation of many different biases of fact finding - all compounded over time. He concludes that for a historian to attempt a more objective method, one must accept that history can only aspire to a conversation of the present with the past - and that one's methods of fact gathering should be openly examined.  Historical truth and facts therefore change over time, and reflect only the present consensus (if that).

Nevertheless, the principles described herein have analogous treatment in other legal systems (such as [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems) as well.&lt;/ref&gt; the general concept and analysis of fact reflects fundamental principles of [[jurisprudence]], and is supported by several well-established standards.&lt;ref name="Estrich000"&gt;{{cite book

=== Legal pleadings ===
{{main|Pleading}}
A party to a civil suit generally must clearly state all relevant allegations of fact that form the basis of a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. The requisite level of precision and particularity of these allegations varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading.&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. McDonald, ''Alternative Pleading in the United States: I'' Columbia Law Review, Vol. 52, No. 4 (Apr., 1952), pp. 443-478&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, a party may plead separate sets of facts that (when considered together) may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This (seemingly) logically-inconsistent presentation of facts may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies (such as ''[[res judicata]]'') that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation of the underlying facts.&lt;ref&gt;(McDonald 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In each episode Philip Mould and Fiona Bruce focus their attention on a painting (or a group of paintings), usually related to one particular artist. Season 7, episode 5 saw the show tackle their first [[sculpture]], a work attributed to [[Alberto Giacometti]]. The team, assisted by [[Bendor Grosvenor]] in series 1 to 5, investigate the paintings on a number of fronts: establishing the provenance of the piece by working backwards from present day to the time of the work's creation; on a forensic level, with investigation and scientific tests on the materials used to help establish specific time frames; and examining the unique painting styles and quirks of the artist. This evidence is then presented to established authorities to help demonstrate the legitimacy of the work and its possible addition to the relevant [[catalogue raisonné]].

| ShortSummary    = Experts determined whether three works - ''Lady with Dogs'', ''Darby and Joan'' and ''Crowd Scene'' - were genuine paintings by [[L. S. Lowry]] or forgeries. They had been bought in the 1960s by a Cheshire businessman, Gerald Ames. Lowry was described as "probably the most faked British artist, his deceptively simple style of painting making him a soft target for forgers." Experts analysed the paint used in one of the paintings, but the white paint did not match the flake white Lowry claimed to have always used. Lowry claimed to have only used five colours, [[White lead|flake white (lead white)]], [[ivory black]], [[Vermilion|vermillion red]], [[Prussian blue]] and [[yellow ochre]], produced by [[Winsor &amp; Newton]]. Photographic evidence from the 1950s, however, showed that he had experimented with both [[titanium white]] and [[zinc white]]: ''Darby and Joan'' contained traces of zinc white. The same painting was also plainly visible in a contemporary BBC documentary film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0612kxh/fake-or-fortune-series-4-1-lowry |title=BBC iPlayer - Fake or Fortune? - Series 4: 1.

| ShortSummary    = Charles Henty seeks to validate the provenance of two inherited paintings, one by [[Alfred Munnings]] and one, putatively by [[Winston Churchill]], discovered in a coal hole of a house in [[Ebury Street]]. Having suffered the death of his uncle, Charles wishes to sell the paintings to fund the continuation of a working farm in France.

Philip Mould visits David Coombs, a leading expert on the art of Churchill, who is unconvinced by the painting on account of the unfamiliarly well painted figures. He is particularly concerned by the colouring which, he feels, is tonally dissimilar to Churchill's accepted oeuvre. Having travelled to [[France]], the team discover, thanks to Luc Tombeur, that the painting is not of [[Èze]], as originally thought, but of the Fountain of Saint-Paul in [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]]. They are introduced to Joy Lutenbacher, who recalls that her aunt, Joan Smith, witnessed Churchill paint the fountain. Bendor Grosvenor also finds evidence in a 1949 newsreel that Churchill painted the scene. Finally, Lutenbacher provides a signed photo of Churchill that had been given to Joan Smith, dated October 1945. Despite this evidence, Coombs' initial 'serious misgivings' have not disappeared, and he decides to include the painting in his [[catalogue raisonné]], although only in the 'Mysteries' section.

Munnings' painting ''[[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]] Winter Landscape'' is found to be of a scene of which the artist was particularly fond and painted more than five times. In a twist of fate, the church depicted in the painting is the final resting place of a notorious art forger, [[Tom Keating]], who was known to have forged Munnings' work. However, this is a mere coincidence and experts Lorian Peralta-Ramos and Dr Bill Teatheredge agree that the painting should be accepted as a work by Munnings.

| ShortSummary       = A [[portrait]] purportedly done by [[Lucian Freud]] is brought to the attention of the team. However, an outright denial by Freud himself looms over the team; the artist claimed he never painted the artwork under investigation. Faced with repudiating the words of the artist himself, the team trace the painting back to Freud's time during his teenage years at [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]], just before the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Fiona finds out through both a previous work's history and through an interview with Freud's daughter that Freud didn't consider works he finished himself to be worthy of his attention, especially ones where someone else had done work on his artwork, suggesting a reason for his denial. Despite the hope of [[DNA evidence]] by an embedded hair in the painting not panning out, notes from Freud's [[solicitor]] and forensic evidence of the paint and the paint strokes indicate most of the painting was done by one hand, possibly done on an abandoned canvas that already was painted beforehand at the art school Freud attended and then discarded to the side. In the end, when presented with the collected evidence, a panel of three experts on Freud's work deem the painting to have been mostly done by Freud, significantly increasing its value at auction.

| ShortSummary       = A woman asks the team to prove [[Saint Amelia, Queen of Hungary|a work]], housed at Castle of Park in [[Aberdeenshire]], was painted by [[Paul Delaroche]]. The painting was acquired by the woman's husband when he worked for [[Christie's]] back in the 1980s, but he never managed to get it authenticated before he died. Delaroche did paint Saint Amelia as a royal commission done for [[Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily|Maria Amalia]], wife of [[Louis Philippe I]], before they were deposed in 1848. The artwork could thus be a [[lost work]] from the [[French Revolution of 1848]]. The alternative Philip needs to investigate is if it is instead a (legitimate) copy done by contemporary painters or printmakers, as Delaroche proved popular to replicate. Bendor reveals at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]] in [[Surrey]], where [[Queen Victoria]] offered the deposed couple refuge from the Revolution, that the artwork in question did reach English shores, as it is prominently displayed in a painting of Amalia's bedroom by historical watercolour artist [[Joseph Nash]]. Differences in colour to known copies of the painting are scientifically explained by pigment degradation. Though the team is unable to establish the provenance between the death of Maria Amalia's son in 1896 and the 1980s purchase, the painting is still deemed to be a genuine Delaroche and the lost work of Maria Amalia. In an 11th hour surprise, the appraiser reveals a letter written by Delaroche where he details how he was disgusted at the pitiful state of the picture when he saw it looking over the commission of a [[stained glass window]] version of his artwork and he undertakes the task of restoring the picture back to its former state, thus explaining the rest of the artifacts revealed by the forensic analysis.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2016|07|31|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  A [[Lincolnshire]] resident asks the team to investigate a sketch that is purported to be done by [[Auguste Rodin]]. Known primarily for sculptures like ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' and ''[[The Thinker]]'', Rodin was also accomplished as an artist in other forms, his best known work being a series of [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] of a [[Royal ballet of Cambodia|Cambodian dance troupe]] that toured in Paris around the turn of the 20th century. The drawing was inherited from the owner's mother while she was living in Mexico in the 1940s after doing some work for the interior of a restaurant. Bendor's research reveals that of an estimated 150 Cambodian sketches done by Rodin, 120 are in the [[Musee Rodin]] and 21 authentic works are in other museums, which leaves fewer than 10 in private hands. In addition, Rodin was an often-counterfeited artist in both his sculptures and artwork. The name [[Ernest Durig]] pops up in the research: at the time, he was known as a respectable sculptor and art dealer, but long after the drawing was given to the owner's mother, Durig was exposed as a prolific forger of Rodin; his name was most recently at the center of a Rodin sketches forgery scandal at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 2014. Going to the Musée Rodin, Fiona finds out that the dancers had mesmerized Rodin so much that one series of sketches was done on wrapping paper obtained from a [[greengrocer]], due to his forgetting his sketch paper. When looking at several other sketches, Philip latches on to a particular technique of Rodin, where he blotted the watercolours with minimal strokes while making the dancers seem to be floating. Denied access to a cache of Durig sketches at [[MoMA]] for comparison, a signature expert casts more doubt, leading Fiona to reveal that Rodin would leave it up to recipients of his sketches to make their own signature, as he couldn't be cared to sign his works. The appraiser who revealed the Rodin fakes at the Musée d'Orsay deems the sketch to be not by Rodin, but by the forger Durig.

[[Infrared]] examination revealed that the back had the title "Rejected", the name Tom Roberts and an address in London's [[Haymarket, London|Haymarket]] that was shown to be Roberts' address while studying at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]].

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2017|09|10|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = The team investigate two possible works by [[Paul Gauguin]] which have been brought to their attention. One appeared to be the first pencil sketch for Gauguin's Tahitian masterpiece ''[[When Will You Marry?|When Will you Marry?]].'' It had been bought by the viewer's art historian grandfather, but its authenticity was in doubt because it appeared to be a copy of a sketch in Gauguin's notebook. The team establish provenance that takes it back to Gauguin and show that it had been cut from the sketchbook sometime between 1916 and 1932. It is accepted as genuine by the Wildenstein Institute.

The second possible Gauguin is a still life depicting a bowl of fruit which had been sold as a genuine Gauguin several times and had appeared in a [[catalogue Raisonne]]. However, the signature and dedication had been added after the original paint had dried and the signature did not appear genuine. The sale in which it had first appeared included a number of works now attributed to other artists. Connoisseurship also raises doubts about the style and Mould and Bruce conclude that it is not genuine.

| ShortSummary       = A [[William Nicholson (artist)|William Nicolson]] painting, of a glass jug, plates and two pears, was purchased by a collector from the estate of her aunt, [[Lillian Browse]], a respected gallery owner and author of Nicholson's catalogue raisonné. The painting is not included, however, in the current catalogue raisonné compiled by expert Patricia Reed. A wealth of new scientific and documentary evidence was collected, including provenance to a previous wealthy London art-collector, [[x-ray]] evidence to show the board had originally borne a painting of [[freesia]]s (missing from Nicolson's catalogue), and a comparison of the pigments in the paint with traces left in an original painting box owned by Nicolson's grandson. Reed does not change her opinion, however, stating that there is insufficient evidence to show that it was definitely by Nicholson.&lt;ref name=Express2018-08-12/&gt; and not someone working alongside him.&lt;ref name="BBC-b0bg6f43"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nicholson |series=''Fake or Fortune?'' |serieslink=Fake or Fortune? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bg6f43/fake-or-fortune-series-7-1-nicholson |accessdate=18 August 2018 |network= [[BBC Television]] |date= 12 August 2018  |seriesno=7 |number=1 |transcript= |transcripturl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|08|19|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  Two sketchbooks found in a garden shed in [[Saint-Émilion]] were given to a teenage boy, Alain, by his grandmother in 1965. Although she never revealed their origin, they were thought to be the work of [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Alain waited 50 years before presenting the sketches to the committee responsible for authenticating the work of Toulouse-Lautrec. The committee did not accept them as authentic and concluded they were the work of another artist [[René Princeteau]]. The sketchbooks contain images of women, horses, sailors, soldiers and dogs, not the subjects for which Toulouse-Lautrec is best known. Some of the pages are dated 1880, when Toulouse-Lautrec would have been just a teenager. The team travel to [[Albi]] in southern France, where Toulouse-Lautrec was born, and visit his family home, Chateau du Bosc, where he spent much of his youth. Compelling technical analysis is provided by print expert Harriet Stratis from [[Chicago]] who reports that the sketchbooks match those already known to be by Toulouse-Lautrec and that some sheets have tiny pin-pricks in each corner, which are a distinctive feature of the artist's hand. The committee does not provide a clear decision either way, but offers to re-examine the books at a later date.

| ShortSummary       = The team investigate whether a small watercolour sketch could be by the British 20th-century sculptor [[Henry Moore]], thought to be the only piece by a British artist in a private collection of around 1,500 works discovered in Germany in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/drawing-in-the-gurlitt-hoard-an-unknown-henry-moore-1193831&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the [[2012 Munich artworks discovery|Gurlitt Hoard]], it is suspected to contain many objects of art looted by the Nazis, and the team is now asked by the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern|Museum of Fine Art]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland, to find out if the sketch is among these. Philip meets Moore's only child Mary, who says she can see her father's hand in the sketch. Forensic tests on the ink used in the sketch are inconclusive, but [[infrared]] analysis reveals more sketches on the back of the paper. Fiona discovers that in the early 1930s [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], the man who amassed the hoard, worked as a museum curator and exhibited works by Moore who, at the time, was less appreciated at home in Britain. Furthermore, Gurlitt later became one of only four dealers asked to sell off what the Nazis branded as [[degenerate art]] on the international market, purchasing some for himself. When the team find an accurate description of the sketch, they can link one of Gurlitt's purchases to what was exhibited years before, thus establishing an unbroken provenance. In the end the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] accepts the sketch as a genuine Moore.

| ShortSummary      = The team investigates two rare portraits of [[black British]] subjects from the 18th and 19th centuries, pictures which are highly unusual in their positive depiction of black sitters at a time when Britain was still heavily engaged in [[Atlantic slave trade|slavery]]. 

The first case is a double portrait featuring [[Dido Elizabeth Belle|Dido Belle]], a former slave who became a member of the aristocratic Mansfield family, and her cousin Lady Elizabeth. The painting is on display at [[Scone Palace]] in Scotland and was commissioned by the first [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], Dido Belle's guardian, sometime in the late 1770s or early 1780s. The [[Abolitionism|abolishionist]] Mansfield, a judge, had ruled in the infamous case of the [[Zong massacre]]. The painting's original attribution, to [[Johan Zoffany]], is considered wrong, but the identity of the actual artist is unclear. The second painting, even more unusual, is of two beautifully-dressed black girls holding a book in what appears to be a tropical landscape. Early clues suggest this could be a political painting, perhaps connected to the campaign to abolish slavery in British colonies. The signature was not legible.

In the end, forensic and other evidence revealed the first portrait to be by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]] and the second by [[Emma Soyer|Emma Jones]].

Philip visits the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]] at the University of East Anglia, where he learns more about how the cast would have been produced. The investigation leads Fiona to France where the current owner's grandmother modelled at the same time and place where Giacometti worked. Without a clear trail of evidence linking the piece to the sculptor, however, the team changes its approach, and discovers that one of the genuine ''Gazing Head'' plasters is considered lost by its British owner, the estate of [[Sidney John Woods|S. J. Woods]], suggesting that it might be possible the piece was purchased from Woods rather than in Paris. 

When the piece and the collected evidence is presented to the [[Giacometti Foundation]] in Paris, the first response is that further studies needed to be made. After several months - the episode was originally scheduled to be aired as part of series 6&lt;ref name="Giacometti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mouldgiacometti" /&gt; - their provisional findings conclude the piece was once an original sculpture by Giacometti, but that the damage sustained may prevent them from accepting it as a genuine work.

'''Fractography''' is the study of the fracture surfaces of materials. Fractographic methods are routinely used to determine the cause of failure in engineering structures, especially in product failure and the practice of [[forensic engineering]] or [[failure analysis]]. In [[material science]] research, fractography is used to develop and evaluate theoretical models of crack growth behavior.

One of the aims of fractographic examination is to determine the cause of failure by studying the characteristics of a fractured surface.  Different types of crack growth (e.g. [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[stress corrosion cracking]], [[hydrogen embrittlement]]) produce characteristic features on the surface, which can be used to help identify the failure mode. The overall pattern of cracking can be more important than a single crack, however, especially in the case of brittle materials like [[ceramic]]s and [[glass]]es.

==Methods==
[[Image:Crankshaft fatigue.jpg|thumbnail|right|Crankshaft fatigue fracture]]
An important aim of fractography is to establish and examine the origin of cracking, as examination at the origin may reveal the cause of crack initiation.  Initial fractographic examination is commonly carried out on a macro scale utilising low power [[optical microscopy]] and oblique lighting techniques to identify the extent of cracking, possible modes and likely origins. Optical microscopy or [[macrophotography]] are often enough to pinpoint the nature of the failure and the causes of crack initiation and growth if the loading pattern is known. 

Common features that may cause crack initiation are [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]]s, [[Cavitation|void]]s or empty holes in the material, [[contamination]], and [[stress concentration]]s.  "Hachures", are the lines on fracture surfaces which show crack direction. The broken crankshaft shown at right failed from a surface defect near the bulb at lower centre, the single brittle crack growing up into the bulk material by small steps, a problem known as [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]].  The crankshaft also shows hachures which point back to the origin of the fracture. Some modes of crack growth can leave characteristic marks on the surface that identify the mode of crack growth and origin on a macro scale e.g. beachmarks or [[:wikt:striation|striation]]s on fatigue cracks. The areas of the product can also be very revealing, especially if there are traces of sub-critical cracks, or cracks which have not grown to completion. They can indicate that the material was faulty when loaded, or alternatively, that the sample was overloaded at the time of failure.
[[Image:Fractured breast implant.jpg|thumbnail|right|Fractured breast implant catheter in SEM]]
A [[Cusp (singularity)|cusp]] is formed where brittle cracks meet, as shown on the picture of a failed catheter (Cp). The cusp was formed by brittle failure of the [[catheter]] on a [[breast implant]] in [[silicone rubber]]. The origin of the cracks is at the shoulder at the left-hand side. Identifying such features will allow a fracture surface map to be made of the surface being studied. The implant failed because of overload, all the imposed loads being concentrated at the connection between the catheter and the bag holding salt solution. As a result, the patient reported loss of fluid from the implant, and it was extracted surgically and replaced.
===USB Microscopy===
[[USB microscope]]s are especially useful for examining fracture surface features since they are small enough to be hand-held. A variety of camera sizes and resolution are available commercially at low cost. The camera cable plugs into the computer via a [[USB]] plug and most such devices come with illumination at the camera supplied by [[LED light]]s.
==Fracture surface map==
[[Image:Fract map1.jpg|thumbnail|right|Fracture map of failed breast implant]]
A schematic fracture surface map is a valuable result of visual or microscopic examination. It seeks to isolate and identify the features on the surface which show how the product failed. Such a map can be a valuable way of presenting information which shows clearly how a crack was initiated which grew with time. In the case of the failed breast implant catheter, the crack path was very simple, but the cause more subtle. Further [[scanning electron microscopy]] showed numerous microcracks between the bag and the catheter, indicating that the adhesive bond between the two components had failed prematurely, perhaps through faulty manufacture. The material of construction of both bag and catheter, silicone rubber is a physically weak elastomer, and product design must allow for the low tear or [[shear strength]] of the material.

==Scanning electron microscopy==
{{Main|Scanning Electron Microscopy}}
In many cases, fractography requires examination at a finer scale, which is usually carried out in a scanning electron microscope or SEM. The resolution is much higher than the optical microscope, although samples are examined in a partial vacuum and colour is absent. Improved SEM's now allow examination at near atmospheric pressures, so allowing examination of sensitive materials such as  those of biological origin. 
The SEM is especially useful when combined with [[Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] or EDX, which can be performed in the microscope, so very small areas of the sample can be analysed for their elemental composition.

==Applications==

Fractography is a widely used technique in [[forensic engineering]], [[forensic materials engineering]] and [[fracture mechanics]] to understand the causes of failures and also to verify theoretical failure predictions with real life failures. It is of use in [[forensic science]] for analysing broken products which have been used as weapons, such as broken bottles for example. Thus a defendant might claim that a bottle was faulty and broke accidentally when it impacted a victim of an assault. Fractography could show the allegation to be false, and that considerable force was needed to smash the bottle before using the broken end as a weapon to deliberately attack the victim. [[Bullet]] holes in glass [[windscreen]]s or windows can also indicate the direction of impact and the energy of the projectile. In these cases, the overall pattern of cracking is vital to reconstructing the sequence of events, rather than the specific characteristics of a single crack. Fractography can determine whether a cause of train derailment was a faulty rail, or if a wing of a plane had fatigue cracks before a crash.

Fractography is used also in materials research, since fracture properties can correlate with other properties and with structure of materials.

'''Helioseismology''', a term coined by [[Douglas Gough]], is the study of the structure and dynamics of the [[Sun]] through its oscillations.  These are principally caused by sound waves that are continuously driven and damped by convection near the Sun's surface.  It is similar to [[seismology|geoseismology]], or [[asteroseismology]] (also coined by Gough), which are respectively the studies of the [[Earth]] or [[star]]s through their oscillations. While the Sun's oscillations were first detected in the early 1960s, it was only in the mid-1970s that it was realised that the oscillations propagated throughout the Sun and could allow scientists to study the Sun's deep interior.  The modern field is separated into '''global helioseismology''', which studies the Sun's resonant modes, and '''local helioseismology''', which studies all the waves propagating at the Sun's surface.&lt;ref name="gb2005"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Gizon | first1 = L. | last2 = Birch | first2 = A.

Helioseismology has contributed to a number of scientific breakthroughs.  The most notable was to show the predicted neutrino flux from the Sun could not be caused by flaws in stellar models and must instead be a problem of [[particle physics]].  The so-called [[solar neutrino problem]] was ultimately resolved by [[neutrino oscillations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Bahcall | first1 = J.

The experimental discovery of neutrino oscillations was recognized by the 2015 [[Nobel Prize for Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34443695 | title=Neutrino 'flip' wins physics Nobel Prize | journal=BBC News | date=6 October 2015 | author=Webb, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Helioseismology also allowed accurate measurements of the quadrupole (and higher-order) moments of the Sun's gravitational potential, which are consistent with [[general relativity]].  The first helioseismic calculations of the Sun's internal rotation profile showed a rough separation into a rigidly-rotating core and differentially-rotating envelope.  The boundary layer is now known as the [[tachocline]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Spiegel | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Zahn | first2 = J.-P. | title = The solar tachocline | year = 1992 | journal =  	Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume = 265 | pages = 106| bibcode = 1992A&amp;A...265..106S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is thought to be a key component for the [[solar dynamo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Fan | first1 = Y. | title = Magnetic Fields in the Solar Convection Zone | year = 2009 | journal = Living Reviews in Solar Physics | volume = 6 | pages = 4| bibcode = 2009LRSP....6....4F| doi = 10.12942/lrsp-2009-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it roughly coincides with the base of the solar convection zone—also inferred through helioseismology—it is conceptually a distinct entity.

Helioseismology benefits most from continuous monitoring of the Sun, which began first with uninterrupted observations from near the [[South Pole]] over the southern summer.&lt;ref name="duvall_southpole1983"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Duvall | first1 = Jr. T. L. | last2 = Harvey | first2 = J. W. | title = Observations of solar oscillations of low and intermediate degree | year = 1983 | journal = Nature | volume = 302 | pages = 24| bibcode = 1983Natur.302...24D| doi = 10.1038/302024a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, observations over multiple solar cycles have allowed helioseismologists to study changes in the Sun's structure over decades.  These studies are made possible by global telescope networks like the [[Global Oscillations Network Group]] (GONG) and the [[Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network]] (BiSON), which have been operating for over 20 years.

== Types of solar oscillation ==

The dashed line shows the acoustic cut-off frequency, computed from more precise modelling, and above which modes are not trapped in the star, and roughly-speaking do not resonate.]]
Solar oscillation modes are interpreted (to first order) as vibrations of a spherically symmetric self-gravitating fluid in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]].  Each mode is then characterised by three numbers:

* the number of nodal shells in radius, known as the ''radial order'' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;;
* the total number of nodal circles on each spherical shell, known as the ''angular degree'' &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;; and
* the number of those nodal circles that are longitudinal, known as the ''azimuthal order'' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

The latter two correspond to the quantum numbers of the [[spherical harmonic]]s.  Under these assumptions, it can be shown that
the oscillations are separated into two categories of interior oscillations and a third special category of surface modes.

=== Pressure modes (p-modes) ===

Pressure modes are in essence standing sound waves.  The dominant restoring force is the pressure (rather than buoyancy), hence the name.  All the solar oscillations that are used for inferences about the interior are p-modes, with frequencies between about 1 and 5 millihertz. They span angular degrees from zero (purely radial motion) to several hundred.

=== Gravity modes (g-modes) ===

Gravity modes are lower-frequency modes that are confined to the convectively-stable interior.  The restoring force is buoyancy and thus indirectly gravity, from which they take their name.  They are [[evanescent wave|evanescent]] in the convection zone and therefore have tiny amplitudes at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Appourchaux | first1 = T. | last2 = Belkacem | first2 = K. | last3 = Broomhall | first3 = A.-M. | last4 = Chaplin | first4 = W.

=== Surface gravity modes (f-modes) ===

Surface gravity waves are analogous to waves on deep water.  To good approximation, they follow the same dispersion law: &lt;math&gt;\omega^2=gk_h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the surface gravity and &lt;math&gt;k_h&lt;/math&gt; is the horizontal wavenumber.  Surface gravity modes observed on the Sun are all of very high degree (&lt;math&gt;\ell\gtrsim80&lt;/math&gt;).

The low-frequency region is dominated by the signal of granulation. As the angular degree increases, the individual mode frequencies converge onto clear ridges, each corresponding to a sequence of low-order modes.]]

The chief tool for analysing data in global helioseismology is the [[Fourier transform]].  To good approximation, each mode is a damped harmonic oscillator, for which the power as a function of frequency is a [[Lorentz function]].  Resolved data is usually integrated over the desired spherical harmonic to obtain a single timeseries that can be Fourier transformed.  In this way, helioseismologists combine a power spectrum for each spherical harmonic into a two-dimensional power spectrum.

The lower frequency range of the oscillations is dominated by the variations caused by [[granulation (solar physics)|granulation]]. This must first be filtered out before (or at the same time that) the modes are analysed.  Granular flows at the solar surface are mostly horizontal, from the centres of the rising granules to the narrow downdrafts between them.  Relative to the oscillations, granulation produces a stronger signal in intensity than line-of-sight velocity, so the latter is preferred for helioseismic observatories.

=== Local helioseismology ===

Local helioseismology—a term coined by Charles Lindsey, Doug Braun and Stuart Jefferies in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Lindsey, C. | author2=Braun, D.C. | author3=Jefferies, S.M. | title= "Local Helioseismology of Subsurface Structure" in "GONG 1992.

Thus, ring-diagram analysis is a generalization of global helioseismology applied to local areas on the Sun (as opposed to half of the Sun). For example, the sound speed and [[adiabatic index]] can be compared within magnetically active and inactive (quiet Sun) regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Basu, S. |author2=Antia, H.M. |author3=Bogart, R.S. |title= Ring-Diagram Analysis of the Structure of Solar Active Regions |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |date= August 2004 |volume= 610 |issue= 2 |pages= 1157–1168 |doi= 10.1086/421843 |bibcode= 2004ApJ...610.1157B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is to use the wavefield on the visible disk to learn about active regions on the far side of the Sun. The basic idea in helioseismic holography is that the wavefield, e.g., the line-of-sight Doppler velocity observed at the solar surface, can be used to make an estimate of the wavefield at any location in the solar interior at any instant in time. In this sense, holography is much like [[seismic migration]], a technique in geophysics that has been in use since the 1940s. As another example, this technique has been used to give a seismic image of a solar flare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Donea, A.-C. |author2=Braun, D.C. |author3=Lindsey, C. |title= Seismic Images of a Solar Flare |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |date= March 1999 |volume= 513 |issue= 2 |pages= L143–L146 |doi= 10.1086/311915 |bibcode= 1999ApJ...513L.143D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inversion ==

=== Introduction ===

The Sun's oscillation modes represent a discrete set of observations that are sensitive to its continuous structure.  This allows scientists to formulate [[inverse problem]]s for the Sun's interior structure and dynamics.  Given a reference model of the Sun, the differences in the mode frequencies are weighted averages of the differences between the structure of the reference model and the real Sun.  The difference in the mode frequencies can then be used to infer the differences in the structures.  The weighting functions of these averages are known as ''kernels''.

=== Structure ===

The first inversions of the Sun's structure were made using Duvall's law&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Christensen-Dalsgaard | first1 = J. | last2 = Duvall | first2 = Jr. T.

=== Rotation ===
[[File:HMI 2D solar rotation profile.png|thumb|The internal rotation profile of the Sun inferred using data from the [[Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager]] aboard the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]]. The inner radius has been truncated where the measurements are less certain than 1%, which happens around 3/4 of the way to the core. The dashed line indicates the base of the solar convection zone, which happens to coincide with the boundary at which the rotation profile changes, known as the tachocline.]]

If the Sun were perfectly spherical, the modes with different azimuthal orders ''m'' would have the same frequencies.  Rotation, however, breaks this degeneracy, and the modes frequencies differ by ''rotational splittings'' that are weighted-averages of the rotation rate throughout the Sun.  
Different modes are sensitive to different parts of the Sun and, given enough data, these differences can be used to infer the rotation rate throughout the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Thompson | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Christensen-Dalsgaard | first2 = J. | last3 = Miesch | first3 = M. S. | last4 = Toomre | first4 = J. | title = The Internal Rotation of the Sun | year = 2003 | journal = Annual Review of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | volume = 41 | pages = 599| bibcode = 2003ARA&amp;A..41..599T| doi = 10.1146/annurev.astro.41.011802.094848 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the Sun rotated with the same rotational frequency throughout, then all the modes would be split by the same amount.  In reality, different layers of the Sun rotate at different speeds, as can be seen at the surface, where the equator rotates faster than the poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Beck | first1 = J. G. | title = A comparison of differential rotation measurements - (Invited Review) | year = 2000 | journal = Solar Physics | volume = 191 | pages = 47| bibcode = 2000SoPh..191...47B| doi = 10.1023/A:1005226402796 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sun rotates slowly enough that a spherical, non-rotating model serves as close enough to reality to derive the rotational kernels.

Helioseismology has shown that the Sun has a rotation profile with several features:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Howe | first1 = R. | title = Solar Interior Rotation and its Variation | year = 2009 | journal = Living Reviews in Solar Physics | volume = 6 | pages = 1| arxiv = 0902.2406 | bibcode = 2009LRSP....6....1H| doi = 10.12942/lrsp-2009-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a rigidly-rotating radiative (i.e. non-convective) zone, though the rotation rate of the inner core is not well known;
* a thin shear layer, known as the ''tachocline'', which separates the rigidly-rotating interior and the differentially-rotating convective envelope;
* a convective envelope in which the rotation rate varies both with depth and latitude; and
* a final shear layer just beneath the surface, in which the rotation rate slows down towards the surface.

== Relationship to other fields ==

=== Geoseismology ===

{{Main|Seismology}}

Helioseismology was born from analogy with [[seismology|geoseismology]] but several important differences remain.  First, the Sun lacks a solid surface and therefore cannot support [[shear wave]]s.  From the data analysis perspective, global helioseismology differs from geoseismology by studying only normal modes.  Local helioseismology is thus somewhat closer in spirit to geoseismology in the sense that it studies the complete wavefield.

=== Asteroseismology ===

{{Main|Asteroseismology}}

Because the Sun is a star, helioseismology is closely related to the study of oscillations in other stars, known as [[asteroseismology]]. Helioseismology is most closely related to the study of stars whose oscillations are also driven and damped by their outer convection zones, known as [[solar-like oscillations|solar-like oscillators]], but the underlying theory is broadly the same for other classes of variable star.

The principal difference is that oscillations in distant stars cannot be resolved.  Because the brighter and darker sectors of the spherical harmonic cancel out, this restricts asteroseismology almost entirely to the study of low degree modes (angular degree &lt;math&gt;\ell\leq3&lt;/math&gt;).  This makes inversion much more difficult but upper limits can still be achieved by making more restrictive assumptions.

== History ==

Solar oscillations were first observed in the early 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Leighton | first1 = R. B. | last2 = Noyes | first2 = R. W. | last3 = Simon | first3 = G. W. | title = Velocity Fields in the Solar Atmosphere. I.

Scientists gradually realised that the oscillations might be global modes of the Sun and predicted that the modes would form clear ridges in two-dimensional power spectra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Leibacher | first1 = J.

At a similar time,  [[Jørgen Christensen-Dalsgaard]] and [[Douglas Gough]] suggested the potential of using individual mode frequencies to infer the interior structure of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Christensen-Dalsgaard | first1 = J. | last2 = Gough | first2 = D. O. | title = Towards a heliological inverse problem | year = 1976 | journal = Nature | volume = 259 | pages = 89| bibcode = 1976Natur.259...89C| doi = 10.1038/259089a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helioseismology developed rapidly in the 1980s. A major breakthrough was made when observations from [[Antarctica]] linked the frequencies for modes of low and intermediate angular degree, from which the radial orders of the modes could be identified.&lt;ref name="duvall_southpole1983" /&gt;  In addition, new methods of inversion developed, allowing researchers to infer the sound speed profile of the Sun.  Towards the end of the decade, observations also began to show that the oscillation mode frequencies vary with the [[solar cycle|Sun's magnetic activity cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Libbrecht | first1 = K. G. | last2 = Woodard | first2 = M. F. | title = Solar-cycle effects on solar oscillation frequencies | year = 1990 | journal = Nature | volume = 345 | pages = 779| bibcode = 1990Natur.345..779L| doi = 10.1038/345779a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To overcome the problem of not being able to observe the Sun at night, several groups had begun to assemble networks of telescopes (e.g. the [[Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network]], or BiSON,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Aindow | first1 = A. | last2 = Elsworth | first2 = Y.

Long, uninterrupted observations brought the field to maturity, and the state of the field was summarized in a 1996 special issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal = Science | title = Special Issue: GONG Helioseismology | volume = 272 | issue = 5266 | year = 1996 | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/272/5266}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This coincided with the start of normal operations of the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SoHO), which began producing high-quality data for helioseismology.

The subsequent years saw the resolution of the solar neutrino problem and the long observations began to allow analysis of multiple solar activity cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Chaplin | first1 = W.

Space-based observations by SoHO have continued and SoHO was joined in 2010 by the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO), which has also been monitoring the Sun continuously since its operations began.  In addition, ground-based networks (notably BiSON and GONG) continue to operate, providing nearly continuous data from the ground too.

=== Product applications for user value creation ===

Industrial AI can be embedded to existing products or services to make them more effective, reliable, safer, and last longer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One example is the automobile industry uses vision recognition to avoid accidents, stay in lane, and use speech recognition to facilitate safer driving. In manufacturing, one example is the prediction of blade life for self-aware [[Bandsaw|band saw]] machines, so that users will be able to rely on evidence of degradation rather than experience, which is safer, will extend blade life, and build up blade usage profile to help blade selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=【世界翻轉中】不怕機器翻臉　感應器讀懂它的心！ - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFlmZgbbWBA|website=Youtube|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Shanhu|last2=Begheri|first2=Behrad|last3=Kao|first3=Hung-An|last4=Lee|first4=Jay|date=2015|title=A Unified Framework and Platform for Designing of Cloud-Based Machine Health Monitoring and Manufacturing Systems|url=https://manufacturingscience.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleID=2397338|journal=Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering|volume=137|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1115/1.4030669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aforementioned band saw machine manufacturer also announced their service center system to help users improve equipment reliability and sawing efficiency as a novel business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Service Center Equipment Brands|url=http://www.metalcenternews.com/Portals/51/PDF_Files/1505_Top5_ServiceCenters.pdf|website=Metal Center News|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process applications for productivity improvement ===
Automation is one of the major aspects in process applications of industrial AI.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; With the help of AI, the scope and pace of automation have been fundamentally changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Chui|first2=Michael|last3=Miremadi|first3=Mehdi|last4=Bughin|first4=Jacques|last5=George|first5=Katy|last6=Willmott|first6=Paul|last7=Dewhurst|first7=Martin|date=2017|title=A Future that Works: Automation, Employment, and Productivity|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Global%20Themes/Digital%20Disruption/Harnessing%20automation%20for%20a%20future%20that%20works/MGI-A-future-that-works-Executive-summary.ashx|journal=|volume=|pages=|last1=Manyika|first1=James|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI technologies boost the performance and expand the capability of conventional AI applications. An example is the [[collaborative robots]]. Collaborative robotic arms are able to learn the motion and path demonstrated by human operators and perform the same task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Does Collaborative Robot Mean ?|url=http://blog.robotiq.com/what-does-collaborative-robot-mean|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI also automates the process that used to require human participation. An example is the Hong Kong subway, where an AI program decides the distribution and job scheduling of engineers with more efficiency and reliability than human counterparts do.

Another aspect of process applications is the modeling large-scale systems.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Cyber manufacturing|Cybermanufacturing]] systems are defined as a manufacturing service system that is networked and resilient to faults by evidence-based modeling and data-driven [[deep learning]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such a system deals with large and usually geographically distributed assets, which is hard to be modeled via conventional individual-asset physics-based model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=Chao|last2=Djurdjanovic|first2=Dragan|last3=Ardakani Davari|first3=Hossein|last4=Wang|first4=Keren|last5=Buzza|first5=Mathew|last6=Begheri|first6=Behrad|last7=Brown|first7=Ptrick|last8=Lee|first8=Jay|title=A comprehensive framework of factory-to-factory dynamic fleet-level prognostics and operation management for geographically distributed assets|journal=2015 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)|date=2015|pages=225–230|doi=10.1109/CoASE.2015.7294066}}&lt;/ref&gt; With machine learning and optimization algorithms, a bottom-up framework considering machine health can leverage large samples of assets and automate the operation management, spare part inventory planning, and maintenance scheduling process.

=== Insight applications for knowledge discovery ===
Industrial AI can also be used for [[knowledge discovery]] by identifying insights in engineering systems.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In aviation and aeronautics, AI has been playing a vital role in many critical areas, one of which is safety assurance and root cause. NASA is trying to proactively manage risks to aircraft safety by analyzing flight numeric data and text reports in parallel to not only detect anomalies but also relate it to the causal factors. This mined insight of why certain faults happen in the past will shed light on predictions of similar incidents in the future and prevent problems before they occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laskowski|first1=Nicole|title=NASA uses text analytics to bolster aviation safety|url=http://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/feature/NASA-uses-text-analytics-to-bolster-aviation-safety|website=TechTarget Network|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Predictive and preventive maintenance]] through data-driven [[machine learning]] is also critical in cost reduction for industrial applications. [[Prognostics]] and health management ([[Prognostics and health management|PHM]]) programs capture the opportunities at the shop floor by modeling equipment health degradation. The obtained information can be used for efficiency improvement and quality improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Lapira|first2=Edzel|title=Prognostics and health management tools for semiconductor manufacturing predictability|journal=Nanochip|date=2011|pages=11–15|url=http://imscenter.net/IMS_news/AGS_Nanochip.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Please see [[intelligent maintenance system]] for more reference.

== Challenges ==
The challenges of industrial AI to unlock the value lies in the transformation of raw data to intelligent predictions for rapid decision-making. In general, there are four major challenges in realizing industrial AI.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Data ===
Engineering systems now generate a lot of data and modern industry is indeed a [[big data]] environment. However, industrial data usually is structured, but may be low-quality. The “3B” issues of [[industrial big data]] is:&lt;ref name="Industrial Big Data"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|title=Industrial Big Data|date=2015|publisher=Mechanical Industry Press|location=China|isbn=978-7-111-50624-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bad
The quality of the data may be poor, and unlike other consumer-faced applications, data from industrial systems usually have clear physical meanings, which makes it harder to compensate the quality with volume.
* Broken
Data collected for training machine learning models usually is lacking a comprehensive set of working conditions and health states/fault modes, which may cause false positives and false negatives in online implementation of AI systems.
* Background
Industrial data patterns can be highly transient and interpreting them requires domain expertise, which can hardly be harnessed by merely mining numeric data.

=== Speed ===
Production process happens fast and the equipment and work piece can be expensive, the AI applications need to be applied in real-time to be able to detect anomalies immediately to avoid waste and other consequences. Cloud-based solutions can be powerful and fast, but they still would not fit certain computation efficiency requirements. Edge computing may be a better choice in such scenario.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== High fidelity requirement ===
Unlike consumer-faced AI recommendations systems which have a high tolerance for false positives and negatives, even a very low rate of false positives or negatives rate may cost the total credibility of AI systems. Industrial AI applications are usually dealing with critical issues related to safety, reliability, and operations. Any failure in predictions could incur a negative economic and/or safety impact on the users and discourage them to rely on AI systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Interpretability ===
Besides prediction accuracy and performance fidelity, the industrial AI systems must also go beyond prediction results and give root cause analysis for anomalies. This requires that during development, data scientists need to work with domain experts and include domain know-how into the modeling process, and have the model adaptively learn and accumulate such insights as knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17044">The '''kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)''' method is a [[Monte Carlo method]] computer simulation intended to simulate the time evolution of some processes occurring in nature.  Typically these are processes that occur with known transition rates among states.  It is important to understand that these rates are inputs to the KMC algorithm, the method itself cannot predict them.

The KMC method is essentially the same as the [[dynamic Monte Carlo method]] and the [[Gillespie algorithm]].

==Algorithms==
One possible classification of KMC algorithms is as rejection-KMC (rKMC) and rejection-free-KMC (rfKMC).

===Rejection-free KMC===
[[Image:Transfer_rates.svg|thumb|240px|alt=Transfer rates between one initial and four final states|At each step, the system can jump into several ending states, the transfer rates between the initial state and all the possible ending states are supposed to be known.]]

A rfKMC algorithm, often only called KMC, for simulating the time evolution of a system, where some processes can occur with known rates r, can be written for instance as follows:

[[Image:State decision in KMC.svg|thumb|240px|Choice of the final state : a random var is chosen between 0 and Γ&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;; the probability that the system jumps into state ''i'' is proportional to Γ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

# Set the time &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# Choose an initial state  ''k''.
# Form the list of all &lt;math&gt;N_k&lt;/math&gt; possible transition rates in the system &lt;math&gt;r_{ki}&lt;/math&gt;, from state ''k'' into a generic state ''i''. States that do not communicate with ''k'' will have &lt;math&gt;r_{ki}=0&lt;/math&gt;.
# Calculate the cumulative function &lt;math&gt;R_{ki}=\sum_{j=1}^i r_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots,N_k&lt;/math&gt;. The total rate is &lt;math&gt;Q_k =  R_{k,N_k}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Get a uniform random number &lt;math&gt;u \in (0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;.
# Find the event to carry out ''i'' by finding the ''i'' for which &lt;math&gt;R_{k,i-1} &lt; u Q_k \le R_{ki}&lt;/math&gt; (this can be achieved efficiently using [[binary search]]).
# Carry out event ''i'' (update the current state &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow i&lt;/math&gt;).
# Get a new uniform random number &lt;math&gt;u^\prime \in (0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;.
# Update the time with &lt;math&gt;t = t + \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta t =  Q_k^{-1} \ln(1/u^\prime)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Return to step 3.

(Note: because the average value of &lt;math&gt;\ln(1/u^\prime)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to unity, the same ''average'' time scale can be obtained by instead using &lt;math&gt;\Delta t = Q_k^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; in step 9. In this case, however, the delay associated with transition ''i'' will not be drawn from the [[Poisson distribution]] described by the rate &lt;math&gt;Q_k&lt;/math&gt;, but will instead be the mean of that distribution.)

This algorithm is known in different sources variously as the '''residence-time algorithm''' or the '''''n''-fold way''' or the '''Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz  (BKL)''' algorithm. It is important to note that the timestep involved is a function of the probability that all events ''i'', did not occur.

===Rejection KMC===
Rejection KMC has typically the advantage of an easier data handling, and faster computations for each attempted step, since the time consuming action of getting all &lt;math&gt;r_{ki}&lt;/math&gt; is not needed.
On the other hand, the time evolved at each step is smaller than for rfKMC. The relative weight of pros and cons varies with the case at hand, and with available resources.

An rKMC associated with the same transition rates as above can be written as follows:

# Set the time &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# Choose an initial state  ''k''.
# Get the number &lt;math&gt;N_k&lt;/math&gt; of all possible transition rates, from state ''k'' into a generic state ''i''.
# Find the ''candidate'' event to carry out ''i'' by uniformly sampling from the &lt;math&gt;N_k&lt;/math&gt; transitions above.
# Accept the event with probability &lt;math&gt;f_{ki} = r_{ki} / r_0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is a suitable upper bound for &lt;math&gt;r_{ki}&lt;/math&gt;. It is often easy to find &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; without having to compute all  &lt;math&gt;r_{ki}&lt;/math&gt; (e.g., for Metropolis transition rate probabilities).
# If accepted, carry out event ''i'' (update the current state &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow i&lt;/math&gt;).
# Get a new uniform random number &lt;math&gt;u^\prime \in (0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;.
# Update the time with &lt;math&gt;t = t + \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta t =  (N_k r_0)^{-1} \ln(1/u^\prime)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Return to step 3.

(Note: &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; can change from one MC step to another.)
This algorithm is usually called a '''standard algorithm'''.

==Time-dependent Algorithms==
If the rates &lt;math&gt;r_{ki}(t)&lt;/math&gt; are time dependent, step 9 in the rfKMC must be modified by:&lt;ref&gt;A. Prados, J. J. Brey and B. Sanchez-Rey, Journal of Statistical Physics 89, 709-734 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\Delta t} Q_k(t') dt' =  \ln(1/u^\prime)&lt;/math&gt;.
The reaction (step 6) has to be chosen after this by
:&lt;math&gt;R_{k,i-1}(\Delta t)  &lt;  u  Q_k( \Delta t ) \leq R_{ki}(\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt;

Another very similar algorithm is called the First Reaction Method (FRM). It consists of choosing the first-occurring reaction, meaning to choose the smallest time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the corresponding reaction number ''i'', from the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\Delta t_i} r_{ki}(t') dt' =  \ln(1/u_i) &lt;/math&gt;,
where the &lt;math&gt;u_i \in (0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; are N random numbers.

==Comments on the algorithm==
The key property of the KMC algorithm (and of the FRM one) is that if the rates are correct, if the processes associated with the rates are of the [[Poisson process]] type, and if different processes are independent (i.e. not correlated) then the KMC algorithm gives the correct time scale for the evolution of the simulated system. There was some debate about the correctness of the time scale for rKMC algorithms, but this was also rigorously shown to be correct.&lt;ref name="Serebrinsky2011" /&gt;

If furthermore the transitions follow [[detailed balance]], the KMC algorithm can be used to simulate thermodynamic equilibrium. However, KMC is widely used to simulate non-equilibrium processes,&lt;ref&gt;B. Meng and W. H. Weinberg, J. Chem. Phys. '''100''', 5280 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; in which case detailed balance need not be obeyed.

The rfKMC algorithm is efficient in the sense that every iteration is guaranteed to produce a transition. However, in the form presented above it requires &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; operations for each transition, which is not too efficient. In many cases this can be much improved on by binning the same kinds of transitions into bins, and/or forming a tree data structure of the events. A constant-time scaling algorithm of this type has recently been developed and tested.&lt;ref&gt;A. Slepoy, A. P. Thompson, and S. J. Plimpton, A constant-time kinetic Monte Carlo 
algorithm for simulation of large biochemical reaction networks, Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 128, Issue 20, December 2007, Page 205101&lt;/ref&gt;

The major disadvantage with rfKMC is that all possible rates &lt;math&gt;r_{ki}&lt;/math&gt; and reactions have to be known in advance. The method itself can do nothing about predicting them. The rates and reactions must be obtained from other methods, such as [[diffusion]] (or other) experiments, [[molecular dynamics]] or [[density-functional theory]] simulations.

==Examples of use==
KMC has been used in simulations of the following physical systems:

To give an idea what the "objects" and "events" may be in practice, here is one concrete simple example, corresponding to example 2 above.

Consider a system where individual atoms are deposited on a surface one at a time (typical of [[physical vapor deposition]]), but also may migrate on the surface with some known jump rate &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. In this case the "objects" of the KMC algorithm are simply the individual atoms.

If two atoms come right next to each other, they become immobile. Then the flux of incoming atoms determines a rate ''r''&lt;sub&gt;deposit&lt;/sub&gt;, and the system can be simulated with KMC considering all deposited mobile atoms which have not (yet) met a counterpart and become immobile. This way there are the following events possible at each KMC step:

* A new atom comes in with rate 'r''&lt;sub&gt;deposit&lt;/sub&gt;
* An already deposited atom jumps one step with rate ''w''.

After an event has been selected and carried out with the KMC algorithm, one then needs to check whether the new or just jumped atom has become immediately adjacent to some other atom. If this has happened, the atom(s) which are now adjacent needs to be moved away from the list of mobile atoms, and correspondingly their jump events removed from the list of possible events.

Naturally in applying KMC to problems in physics and chemistry, one has to first consider whether the real system follows the assumptions underlying KMC well enough.
Real processes do not necessarily have well-defined rates, the
transition processes may be correlated, in case of atom or particle jumps
the jumps may not occur in random directions, and so on. When simulating
widely disparate time scales one also needs to consider whether
new processes may be present at longer time scales. If any of these
issues are valid, the time scale and system evolution predicted by KMC
may be skewed or even completely wrong.

The first  publication which described the basic features of the KMC method (namely using a cumulative function to select an event and a time scale calculation of the form 1/''R'') was by Young and Elcock in 1966.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The residence-time algorithm was also published at about the same time.&lt;ref&gt;D.R. Cox and H.D. Miller, The Theory of Stochastic Processes (Methuen, London), 1965, pp 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently independent of the work of Young and Elcock, Bortz, Kalos and Lebowitz&lt;ref name="Bortz1975" /&gt; developed a KMC algorithm for simulating the [[Ising model]], which they called the ''n-fold way''. The basics of their algorithm is the same as that of Young,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but they do provide much greater detail on the method.

The following year [[Dan Gillespie]] published what is now known as the [[Gillespie algorithm]] to describe chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;D. T. Gillespie, Journal of Computational Physics 22 (1976) 403&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm is similar and the time advancement scheme essentially the same as in KMC.

There is as of the writing of this (June 2006) no definitive treatise of the theory of KMC, but Fichthorn and Weinberg have discussed the theory for thermodynamic equilibrium KMC simulations in detail.&lt;ref&gt;K. A. Fichthorn and W. H. Weinberg, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.461138 Journal of Chemical Physics '''95''' (1991) 1090] (needs subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; A good introduction is given also by Art Voter,&lt;ref&gt;A. F.

In March, 2006 the, probably, first commercial software using Kinetic Monte Carlo to simulate the diffusion and activation/deactivation of dopants in Silicon and Silicon-like materials is released by [[Synopsys]], reported by Martin-Bragado et al.&lt;ref&gt;I.

==Varieties of KMC==
The KMC method can be subdivided by how the objects are moving or reactions
occurring. At least the following subdivisions are used:

* Lattice KMC ('''LKMC''') signifies KMC carried out on an atomic [[crystal structure|lattice]]. Often this variety is also called atomistic KMC, ('''AKMC'''). A typical example is simulation of [[vacancy (chemistry)|vacancy]] [[diffusion]] in [[alloy]]s, where a [[vacancy (chemistry)|vacancy]] is allowed to jump around the lattice with rates that depend on the local elemental composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mason|first1=D.R.|last2=Hudson|first2=T.S.|last3=Sutton|first3=A.P.|title=Fast recall of state-history in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations utilizing the Zobrist key|journal=Computer Physics Communications|date=January 2005|volume=165|issue=1|pages=37–48|doi=10.1016/j.cpc.2004.09.007|bibcode = 2005CoPhC.165...37M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Object KMC ('''OKMC''') means KMC carried out for [[crystallographic defect|defects]] or [[impurity|impurities]], which are jumping either in random or lattice-specific directions. Only the positions of the jumping objects are included in the simulation, not those of the 'background' lattice atoms. The basic KMC step is one object jump.
* Event KMC ('''EKMC''') or First-passage KMC ('''FPKMC''') signifies an OKMC variety where the following reaction between objects (e.g. clustering of two [[impurity|impurities]] or [[vacancy (chemistry)|vacancy]]-[[interstitial defect|interstitial]] annihilation) is chosen with the KMC algorithm, taking the object positions into account, and this event is then immediately carried out.&lt;ref&gt;J.

'''''Leonardo da Vinci: Flights of the Mind''''' is a 2004 [[biography]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] by [[Charles Nicholl (author)|Charles Nicholl]].

== Description ==

The book researches the life of Leonardo da Vinci in Tuscane and explores the reasons of his historic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of Leonardo da Vinci Flights Of The Mind |date=October 1, 2004|journal=Kirkus Reviews|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/charles-nicholl/leonardo-da-vinci-4/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent 755057"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spalding  |first= Frances |title=Leonardo da Vinci: the Flights of the Mind by Charles Nicholl|journal=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/leonardo-da-vinci-the-flights-of-the-mind-by-charles-nichollbr-leonardo-by-martin-kemp-755057.html | location=London | date=October 29, 2004 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author's main observation is that most of da Vinci's work was unfinished. Through a thorough research, the author dismisses most of the romanticized facts about da Vinci and concludes that a lot is unknown about the genius inventor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andreae  |first=Christopher |date=December 21, 2004|title=Leonardo was a one-man corporation of brilliant ideas  But with so many plans, how could he finish anything? |journal=Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1221/p15s01-bogn.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Da Vinci is described as an engineer obsessed with natural designs.&lt;ref name="nytimes 9A05E0DA143EF936A35751C1A9629C8B63"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gelernter |first=David |date=December 5, 2004|title= The da Vinci Mode |journal=The New York Times Book Review |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E0DA143EF936A35751C1A9629C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Washington Post]]'' writer Alexander Nagel criticized Nicholl's technical analysis of the inventor's paintings that lack insight and misses an opportunity to push deeper into the mind of da Vinci.&lt;ref name="washpost A11891-2004Nov25"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nagel  |first=Alexander |date=November 28, 2004|title=Everything Is Illuminated|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11891-2004Nov25.html | journal=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author retranslates many of da Vinci's mirrorscript writings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selzman  |first= Lisa Jennifer |date=January 23, 2005 |title=Da Vinci decoded / Charles Nicholl's gloriously rendered portrait is rich in detail and a warm piece of storytelling|journal=Houston Chronicle|pages=16|url=http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/ae/books/reviews/3001664}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some guesswork is admittedly thrown in this biography:&lt;ref name="independent 755057"/&gt; an old woman visiting da Vinci in 1493 becomes his mother; Freudian concepts are used to explain his probable homosexuality (Joseph missing from his representations of the Holy Family); His stay in jail is linked to his plans to reverse engineer [[Lock (security device)|lock]]s...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rees  |first=Jasper |date=Oct 10, 2004|title=A slippery genius|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3625219/A-slippery-genius.html | journal=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author also argues that da Vinci's obsession with flying devices comes from his alchemical quest for a levitation technology.&lt;ref name="washpost A11891-2004Nov25"/&gt;

[[David Gelernter]] criticized his interpretations around the hypothetical encounter of [[Michelangelo]] and da Vinci.&lt;ref name="nytimes 9A05E0DA143EF936A35751C1A9629C8B63"/&gt;

The release of ''Leonardo da Vinci: Flights of the Mind'' coincided with the release of another da Vinci biography, ''Leonardo'' by [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gopnik  |first=Adam |date=   January 17, 2005|title=Renaissance Man The life of Leonardo|journal=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/01/17/050117crbo_books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7199">The '''low-rate picture transmission''' (LRPT) is a digital transmission system, intended to deliver images and data from an orbital [[weather satellite]] directly to end users via a [[VHF]] radio signal. It is used aboard polar-orbiting, near-Earth weather satellite programs such as [[MetOp]] and [[NPOESS]].

==Purpose==
LRPT provides three image channels at full sensor resolution (10-bit, 1&amp;nbsp;km/pixel, six lines/second) in addition to data from other sensors, such as [[atmospheric sounder]]s and [[GPS]] positioning information.

The system is an update and replacement of the existing analog system called [[automatic picture transmission]] (APT), which has been used since the 1960s aboard [[NOAA]]'s [[TIROS]] polar-orbiting satellites. The APT system provided only two image channels, which were at a reduced accuracy and resolution (8-bit, 4&amp;nbsp;km/pixel, two lines/second). Compared to the APT system, LRPT images are four times more accurate and contain twelve times the resolution. Further, the additional data from other sensors increases the applications of the satellites and the users who receive the signal.

==Design==
LRPT uses a [[packet (information technology)|packetized]] datastream transmitted at an approximately 62 [[kilobits per second]] (kbit/s) rate. Each sensor using the LRPT is considered an application and provided a percentage of the transmission bandwidth in the form of a virtual channel. For example, the [[advanced very-high-resolution radiometer]] (AVHRR) imaging sensor is provided approximately 40 kbit/s to transmit its three image channels, and the [[high-resolution infrared radiation sounder]] (HIRS) is provided approximately 2900 bit/s. The packetized application system provides the flexibility to transmit and receive new types of data in the future using the same hardware.

The datastream is processed using a [[Reed–Solomon]] error correction, then [[convolution]] encoded, [[forward error correction#Interleaving|interleaved]], and padded with unique synchronization words. The resulting binary stream is approximately 160 kbit/s.

It is transmitted as an 80 [[baud|kiloBaud]] [[quadrature phase-shift keying|quadrature phase-shift keyed]] (QPSK) signal on an RF carrier in the 137&amp;nbsp;MHz-band, with an [[equivalent isotropically radiated power]] level that varies between 3.2 [[dBW]] (2 [[watt]]s) and 8.0 dBW (6.3 watts).

To ensure the low-complexity ground stations that previously received the APT signal would be able to access the LRPT signal, a design study was included with the LRPT specification. Labeled ''Annex 1'', it shows the calculations which approximate the worst-case [[link budget]] for fixed, [[omnidirectional antenna]] reception will be 4.9&amp;nbsp;dB when the satellite is 13° above the horizon, and improve to 8.6&amp;nbsp;dB at 30° or higher elevations.

==Image data==
The AVHRR image data, in its raw form, consists of three images, each composed of six lines per second, at 2048 pixels per line, using 10-bits per pixel. This yields a raw datarate of 368,640 bit/s; approximately ten times greater than the allocated bandwidth. Therefore, the data is compressed using the JPEG extended DCT compression, adapted to a fixed compression ratio with continuous operation (no header or trailer), to fit the virtual channel size.

The imager data is gathered into image "strips" of 2048 pixels wide and 8 rows tall before being compressed. Each packet contains three of these image strips, one for each image channel. To reconstruct a 2048x2048 image requires 256 consecutive AVHRR image packets.

==Current status and future==
Although LRPT is on the European [[MetOp]]-A satellite launched on 19 October 2006, LRPT was permanently deactivated on that vehicle after causing interference with the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/Satellites/CurrentSatellites/Metop/MetopDesign/HIRS/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;).

{{quote|The initial investigations regarding the interference on MetOp-A HIRS have been completed, and the conclusion is that no scenario exists where LRPT on MetOp-A can be turned on without causing heavy interference on HIRS. Due to the operational importance of HIRS and the lack of an established LRPT user community, it is clear that LRPT will not be turned on again operationally on MetOp-A.|Announcement to NOAA from EUMETSAT on 5 February 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://noaasis.noaa.gov/NOAASIS/ml/specialbull.html NOAA special bulletins]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of the fundamental nature of this interference in relation to the [[MetOp]] design, plans to operate LRPT on Metop-B and Metop-C were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/METOP/message/1780] EUMETSAT User Service, July 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NOAA-19]], launched on 6 February 2009 and still operating as of March 2018, is the last NOAA satellite to carry
the old analog [[automatic picture transmission]] (APT) system, which dates back to the 1960s.
At one point, NOAA indicated it would move to a system such as LRPT on future vehicles,
but after the [[NPOESS]] program was replaced with [[JPSS]] in February 2010, NOAA decided to eliminate Low Rate Data (LRD)
transmissions from [[JPSS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://satelliteconferences.noaa.gov/2013/docs/Tuesday,%20April%209,%202013/2.5a_POES%20to%20JPSS%20Transition.ppt, see slides 6 and 9&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2014, Russia launched the METEOR-M No. 2 weather satellite (also known as METEOR-M2) with LRPT on board.
Instructions for receiving LRPT images from this satellite are posted on the
Internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-receiving-meteor-m-n2-lrpt-weather-satellite-images-rtl-sdr/, slides 6 and 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manga Example.png|thumb|right|A page from the ''[[Marmalade Boy]]'' manga, volume 1 (Japanese version)]]
{{Anime and manga}}

Japanese [[manga]] has developed its own visual language or [[iconography]] for expressing emotion and other internal character states. This drawing style has also migrated into [[anime]], as many manga stories are adapted into television shows and films. While this article addresses styles from both types of output, the emphasis here is on the manga origins for these styles.

The popular and recognizable style of manga is very distinctive. Emphasis is often placed on line over form, and the storytelling and panel placement differ from those in American comics. Impressionistic backgrounds are very common, as are sequences in which the panel shows details of the setting rather than the characters. Panels and pages are typically read from right to left, consistent with traditional [[Japanese language#Writing system|Japanese writing]].

Because manga is a diverse art form, however, not all manga artists adhere to the conventions most popularized in the West through series such as ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'', and ''[[Ranma ½]]''.

==Panel characteristics==

There are several expressive techniques typical (and some of them unique) to the manga art form:

*'''[[Screentone]]:''' Transparent adhesive sheets manufactured with a distinctive pattern (typically, some form of dots or hatching, but also including a variety of flashy effects like stars or explosions, or commonplace scenes such as cityscapes, schoolyards, and natural landscapes), these are cut out and overlapped on the panel to introduce shading and detail that would be time-consuming or unfeasible to draw by hand. Increasingly, physical tone sheets are being replaced by computer-generated equivalents.
*'''Expressive dialogue bubbles:''' The borders of the [[Speech balloon|speech/thought bubbles]] change in pattern/style to reflect the tone and mood of the dialogue. For example, an explosion-shaped bubble for an angry exclamation. Also, manga does not usually follow the normal Western comic conventions for speech (solid arc extending from the character's head) and thought bubble (several small circles used in place of the arc). The latter bubble style is often used for whispered dialogue in manga, which can confuse Western readers.
*'''[[Speed line]]s:''' Often in action sequences, the background will possess an overlay of neatly ruled lines to portray direction of movements. Speed lines can also be applied to characters as a way to emphasise the motion of their bodies (limbs in particular). This style, especially background blurs, extends into most action based anime as well.
*'''Mini flashbacks:''' Many artists employ copies of segments from earlier chapters (sometimes only a single panel) and edit them into the story panels to act as a flashback (also applying an overlay of darker tone to differentiate it from current events). This can be considered a convenient method to evoke prior event(s) along with visual imagery. In situations where a character's life events flash across his/her mind, a splash page may be used with the entire background consisting of segments from earlier chapters.
*'''Abstract background effects:''' These involve elaborate hatching patterns in the background and serve to indicate or strengthen the mood of the plot. It can also illustrate a character's state of mind.

==Facial features==
While the art can be incredibly realistic or cartoonish, characters often have large eyes (female characters usually have larger eyes than male characters), small noses, tiny mouths, and flat faces.  Psychological and social research on [[Neoteny|facial attractiveness]] has pointed out that the presence of childlike facial features increases [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/phil_Fak_II/Psychologie/Psy_II/beautycheck/english/kindchenschema/kindchenschema.htm|title=Babyfaceness|date=2002-07-15|publisher=www.beautycheck.de and Universität Regensburg|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manga artists often play on this to increase the appeal of protagonists. Large eyes have become a permanent fixture in manga and anime since the 1960s when [[Osamu Tezuka]] was inspired by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] cartoons from the [[United States]] and started drawing them in this way.

Furthermore, inside the big eyes, the transparent feeling of pupils and the glares, or [[Purkinje images|small reflections]] in the corners of the eyes are often exaggerated, regardless of surrounding lighting, although they are only present in living characters: the eyes of characters who have died are the colour of the iris, but darker. Sometimes this death effect is also used to indicate characters who are emotionless due to trauma or loss of conscious control because of [[spirit possession|possession]] ([[ghost]], [[demon]], [[zombie]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], etc.). In characters with hair partially covering the face, the eyes that would otherwise be covered are often outlined to make them visible, even when the hair is particularly dense and dark.

Certain visual symbols have been developed over the years to become common methods of denoting emotions, physical conditions and mood:

===Eyes===
Eye shape and size can be exaggerated or changed altogether.  Love-hearts and doe-eyes indicate an [[infatuation]], while stars indicate that the character is star-struck.  Spirals indicate confusion or dizziness, while [[flame]]s or wide empty semicircles indicate that the character is angry or vengeful.  When dead, unconscious or stunned, "X"s are sometimes used as an indication of the state. Eyes may be replaced with two "&lt;"s facing in opposite directions to represent a variety of emotions, such as nervousness or excitement.  Eyes without pupils and with reflective glints indicate a state of [[delirium]].

Enlargement of the eyes, where they become huge and perfectly round with tiny pupils and no iris and going beyond the reach of the face (often shown with the mouth becoming like a stretched semicircle, the point of which extends past the chin) symbolises extreme excitement.  Similarly, turning eyes into two thick half-circles, conveys a cute, delighted look (see [[#Character design|Character design]] section below).

The character's eye shapes and sizes are sometimes symbolically used to represent the character. For instance, bigger eyes will usually symbolize beauty, innocence, or purity, while smaller, more narrow eyes typically represent coldness and/or evil. Completely blackened eyes ([[shadow]]ed) indicates a vengeful personality or underlying deep [[anger]]. It could also indicate that someone's being a wise-guy type, particularly when accompanied by grinning. A character's eyes are shadowed regardless of the lighting in the room when they become angry, upset, something is wrong with them, or they are emotionally hurt. Bubbles forming in the corner of a child's or female character's eyes often indicate that the character is about to cry.

===Mouth===

Mouths are often depicted as small, usually rendered with one line on the face.  A fang peeking from the corner of the mouth indicates mischief or feistiness (unless, of course, the character has fangs normally).  A cat mouth (like a number "3" rotated 90° clockwise) replacing the character's normal mouth, and usually accompanied by larger eyes may also represent mischief or feistiness (a notable exception being [[Konata Izumi]] from ''[[Lucky Star (manga)|Lucky Star]]'', whose usual mouth shape is this).

===Nose===

Again, noses are often depicted as small, with only a brief L-shaped mark to locate them.  With female characters, the nose can sometimes be removed completely when the character is facing forward.  In profile, female noses are often button shaped, consisting little more than a small triangle.  A nosebleed indicates sexual excitation following exposure to stimulating imagery or situation. It is based on a Japanese [[old wives' tale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/mangaguide/au1907.html|title=Tanioka Yasuji|last=Van Huffel|first=Peter|accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A balloon dangling from one nostril (a "snot bubble") indicates sleep.

===Head and face===

[[File:Anirage-alternate.svg|right|thumb|Cruciform popping veins above eye on the left and large sweat drop above eye on the right]]
Sweat drops are a common visual convention. Characters are drawn with one or more prominent beads of sweat on their brow or forehead (or floating above the hair on characters whose back is turned). This represents a broad spectrum of emotions, including embarrassment, exasperation, confusion, and shock, not all of which are necessarily considered to be sweat-inducing under normal conditions.  Actual physical perspiration in manga is signified by even distribution of sweat drops over the body, occasionally on top of clothing or hair.

Throbbing "cross popping"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossPoppingVeins |title=Cross-Popping Veins |publisher=TV Tropes |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; veins, usually depicted as a cruciform or [[triskelion]] in the upper head region, indicate [[anger]] or [[irritation]].  These shapes can sometimes be exaggerated, and placed on top of hair when the character is facing away from the viewer. Further throbs indicate additional anger. However, some manga such as ''[[Doraemon]]'' use smoke puffs to represent anger, and does not have the vein insignia.

A red cheek or hatchings on the cheek represent [[blushing]], usually used when embarrassed by romantic feelings, while oval "blush dots" on the cheeks represent rosy cheeks. This can sometimes be confused with a scribble on the cheek, indicating injury. Sometimes when the character is expressing strong emotions, such as sadness, a long blush through the nose would appear.

Facial shape changes depending on the character's mood, and can look from round apple-shaped to a more subtle carrot shape.

Parallel vertical lines with dark shading over the head or under the eye may represent mortification, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or horror. If the lines are wavy, they may represent [[disgust]].  A far cuter way to represent frustration/mortification is (mainly for female/young female characters) that they tend to puff out their cheeks while their line is delivered in a gruff voice, an elongated "3" showing puffed lips, to emphasize that puffed look.

Hair colors of anime characters are not just selected randomly. In some cases they express significant elements of that person's character (based on color symbolism in Japan).

* '''[[Black]]''': Power, [[evil]], [[emptiness]], [[sadness]], mystery, [[sophistication]], completeness, [[death]]
* '''[[White]]''': Purity, simplicity, [[peace]], [[humility]], [[cold]], [[heaven]] (can also mean [[death]])
* '''[[Blue]]''': [[Peace]], calm, stability, [[dependability]], [[male]], [[cold]], [[loyalty]]. With dependability, dark blue means more responsible than light blue.
* '''[[Purple]]''': Royalty, [[wisdom]], [[spirituality]]
* '''[[Red]]''': [[passion (emotion)|Passion]], [[joy]], [[aggression]], [[energy]], [[love]] (basically strong emotions)
* '''[[Pink]]''': [[Femininity]], purity, [[child|childlike]], [[love]], [[kindness]]
* '''[[orange (colour)|Orange]]''': [[Energy]], balance, [[enthusiasm]], [[heat|warmth]], seeking attention
* '''[[blond|Blond(e)]]''': [[Wealth]], heaven, childlike, [[courage]]
* '''[[Green]]''': [[luck|Fortune]] (good and bad), [[envy]], harmony, life, vigor, [[tranquility]]
* '''[[silver (colour)|Silver]]/[[grey|Gray]]''': Reliability, [[intelligence]], [[adult|maturity]], [[sadness]], [[boredom]]
* '''[[Brown]]''': [[Comfort]], simplicity, [[endurance]]

==Character design==

To better elicit a more emotional response with the audience for a certain character, a manga artist or animator will sometimes use certain traits in the character's design. The most common features include youthfulness as a physical trait (younger age or pigtails) or as an emotional trait such as a naive or innocent outlook, a childlike personality, or some obvious sympathetic weakness the character works hard to correct (extreme clumsiness or a life-threatening disease) but never really succeeds to get rid of.

{{see also|Moe (slang)}}

Other artistic conventions used in mainstream manga include:

*A round swelling, sometimes drawn to the size of baseballs, is a visual exaggeration of swelling from injury.
*A white cross-shaped bandage symbol denotes pain. (In older manga, eyes pop out to symbolize pain, as shown in ''[[Dragon Ball]]''.)
*Thick black lines around the character may indicate trembling due to anger, shock or astonishment.&lt;ref name="SB200510"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norimi|first=Morisaki|title=How To Draw Manga: Lesson Three|journal=Shojo Beat|date=October 2005|volume=1|issue=4|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually accompanied by a rigid pose or [[super deformed]] styling.
*Sparks literally fly between the eyes of two characters when they are fighting, or simply glaring at each other (in this case, their eyes may also be connected by a lightning streak).
*A character suddenly falling onto the floor, usually with one or more extremities twisted above himself or herself, is a typically humorous reaction to something unexpected happening.
*All facial features shrinking, the nose disappearing, the character sometimes lifting off the floor and the limbs being multiplied as if moving very fast symbolizes panic; if the same but with larger facial features it symbolizes comic rage or shock. Some may come with a yellow spark like symbol near their head.
*Exaggerated facial features signify anger. Examples such as star-like eyes with dark shading surrounding them while the face is framed by a red and black background imply comedic and/or understated rage. Others may include white circular eyes with slanted eyebrows and a square jaw with sharp teeth or even burning eyes with gritted teeth.
*Tear drops everywhere or forming a twin fountain indicate either intense joy or sadness.
*An [[ellipsis]] appearing over a character's head indicates a silence, implying that something is going unsaid.
*A drooping head may indicate sorrow or depression.&lt;ref name=SB200510 /&gt; Some may come with lines drawn of the hunched character or over their eyes. Variations with wavy lines and white circular eyes can imply embarrassment.
*More often than not, character colorisations tend to represent the character in some way. A more subdued character will be coloured with lighter tones, while a flamboyant character will be done in bright tones. Similarly, villains are often coloured in darker tones, while colder characters will be given neutral tones (black, white, grey, etc.).
*Characters push their index fingers together when admitting a secret or telling the truth to another.
*An odd white shape (more often than not, something close to a mushroom) that appears during an exhale represents a sigh of awkward relief or depression.
*A wavy ghost coming out of the mouth is often a comical representation of depression, mortification, or a comedic and figurative death. This is a reference to the [[hitodama]], as is the above example.
*Cherry blossoms indicate a sweet or beautiful moment. This is a reference to [[Mono no aware]].
*A flower blossom falling off its stem may indicate death or, more commonly, loss of [[virginity]].
*Unbound hair may represent freedom, while hair that is tied back may represent some form of either literal, figurative or emotional enslavement of some kind.
*Sleeping people may be indicated by having a bubble coming out of the nose, said bubble inflating and deflating as they snore. This is usually done when the character sleeps at an inappropriate moment (e.g. during class, at work, outside, in public, in an unusual pose or location, etc.).
*Sometimes, when a character screams or is surprised, they will do [[The Scream]] pose.
*Twitching eyebrows or eyelids may indicate anger or shock that the character is holding back.
*[[Negative (photography)|Negative imagery]] or rapidly dilating eyes often indicates either severe shock or a severe psychological effect.
*The image of something cracking or shattering often signifies either death or a serious event.
*Dark shading over the eyes or the eyes' omission while showing the face often suggest a silent or sullen disposition.
*Twinkling or star-like eyes with a smile often signify excitement while heart-shaped eyes imply immediate attraction to someone or something.
* A serious bloody nose (often mimicking a waterfall) often indicates a romantic or infatuated reaction from male characters.
* A character with white eyes, a stern look, and a dark atmosphere around them can imply barely concealed rage at someone or something. 
*Suddenly changing the character's eyes into [[Heart (symbol)|Valentine heart]]s can also indicate that they are madly in love with another character.
*Smoke or steam coming out of the character's nose indicates that the character is aroused.
*When one character sharply criticized or brings up a topic that is quite sensitive to another character, the impact of their words are sometimes symbolically shown by having their word bubble form an arrow that metaphorically pierces the other person they are talking to.

{{Marxism|Aspects}}

'''Marxist geography''' is a strand of [[critical geography]] that uses the theories and philosophy of [[Marxism]] to examine the [[Spatial analysis|spatial relations]] of [[human geography]]. In Marxist geography, the relations that geography has traditionally analyzed — natural environment and spatial relations — are reviewed as outcomes of the mode of material production. To understand geographical relations, on this view, the social structure must also be examined. Marxist geography attempts to change the basic structure of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peet |first1=J. Richard |title=An Introduction to Marxist Geography |journal=Journal of Geography |date=1985 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=5–10 |doi=10.1080/00221348508979261|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ312759&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ312759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and methodology==

Marxist geography is [[Political_radicalism|radical]] in nature and its primary criticism of the positivist [[spatial science]] centered on the latter's methodologies, which failed to consider the characteristics of [[capitalism]] and abuse that underlie socio-spatial arrangements. As such, early Marxist geographers were explicitly political in advocating for social change and activism; they sought, through application of geographical analysis of social problems, to alleviate [[poverty]] and exploitation in capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David. 1973. "Social Justice and the City"&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist geography makes exegetical claims regarding how the deep-seated structures of capitalism act as a determinant and a constraint to human agency. Most of these ideas were developed in the early 1970s by dissatisfied quantitative geographers; [[David Harvey]] is generally regarded as the primary trail-blazer of the Marxist movement in human geography.

In order to accomplish such philosophical aims, these geographers rely heavily upon Marxist social and economic theory, drawing on [[Marxian economics]] and the methods of [[historical materialism]] to tease out the manner in which the means of [[production control]] human spatial distribution in capitalist structures. [[Karl Marx|Marx]] is also invoked to examine how spatial relationships are affected by [[social class|class]]. The emphasis is on structure and structural mechanisms.

[[File:The_Allegory_of_Immortality_by_Giulio_Romano,_c._1540.jpg|thumb|The Allegory of [[Immortality]] by [[Giulio Romano]], c. 1540. [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], [[Detroit]], MI, USA.]]
A '''monster''' is often a hideously grotesque [[animal]] or [[human]], or a [[Hybrid beasts in folklore|hybrid]] of both, whose appearance frightens and whose powers of destruction threaten the human world's social or moral order.

Animal monsters are outside the moral order, but sometimes have their origin in some human violation of the moral law (e.g. in the Greek myth, Minos does not sacrifice the white bull Poseidon sent him to the god, so as punishment Poseidon makes Minos' wife, Pasiphaë, fall in love with the bull, and she copulates with the beast, and gives birth to the man with a bull's head, [[Minotaur|the Minotaur]]). Human monsters are those who by birth were never fully human ([[Medusa]] and her sisters) or who through some supernatural or unnatural act lost their humanity ([[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[Frankenstein's_monster|Frankenstein's monster]]), and so who can no longer, or who never could, follow the moral law of human society.

Monsters pre-date written history, and the academic study of the particular cultural notions expressed in a society's ideas of monsters is known as ''monstrophy''.{{r|CallForPapers}}

Monsters have appeared in literature and in feature-length films. Well-known monsters in fiction include [[Count Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's monster]], [[werewolf|werewolves]], [[Mummy#Modern mummies|mummies]], and [[zombie]]s.

==Etymology==
[[File:Arminianism as five-headed monster.JPG|thumb|A polemical allegory presented as a five-headed monster, 1618]]''Monster'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''monstrum'', itself derived ultimately from the verb ''moneo'' ("to remind, warn, instruct, or foretell"), and denotes anything "strange or singular, contrary to the usual course of nature, by which the gods give notice of evil," "a strange, unnatural, hideous person, animal, or thing," or any "monstrous or unusual thing, circumstance, or adventure." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l_UsAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=latin+english+dictionary#v=onepage&amp;q=latin%20english%20dictionary The Rev. J.E. Riddle, ''A Complete English-Latin and Latin-English Dictionary'', London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1870, s.v. ''monstrum'', Latin-English part, p. 399].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural heritage==
In the words of Tina Marie Boyer, assistant professor of medieval German literature at [[Wake Forest University]], "monsters do not emerge out of a cultural void; they have a literary and cultural heritage".{{r|Boyer}}

In the religious context of ancient Greeks and Romans, monsters were seen as signs of "divine displeasure", and it was thought that birth defects were especially ominous, being "an unnatural event" or "a malfunctioning of nature".{{sfnp|Beagon|2002|p=127}}

Monsters are not necessarily abominations however. The Roman historian [[Suetonius]], for instance, describes a snake's absence of legs or a bird's ability to fly as monstrous, as both are "against nature".{{sfnp|Wardle|2006|p=330}} Nonetheless, the negative connotations of the word quickly established themselves, and by the playwright and philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s time, the word had extended into its philosophical meaning, "a visual and horrific revelation of the truth".{{sfnp|Staley|2010|pp=80, 96, 109, 113 et passim}}

In spite of this, mythological monsters such as the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] and [[Medusa]] are not natural beings, but divine entities. This seems to be a holdover from [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and other belief systems, in which the divisions between "spirit," "monster," and "god" were less evident.

==Monsters in fiction==

===Prose fiction===
The history of monsters in fiction is long, for example [[Grendel]] in the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' is an archetypal monster, deformed, brutal, with enormous strength and raiding a human settlement nightly to slay and feed on his victims. The modern literary monster has its roots on examples such as the monster in [[Mary Shelley]]'s [[Frankenstein]] and the vampire in [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula]].

Monsters are a staple of [[fantasy fiction]], [[horror fiction]] or [[science fiction]] (where the monsters are often [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] in [[nature]]). There is also a burgeoning subgenre of [[erotic fiction]] involving monsters, [[monster erotica]].

===Film===
{{main|Monster movie}}

====Pre–World War II monster films====
[[File:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Hollywood's interpretation of Frankenstein's monster, played by [[Boris Karloff]]]]
During the age of [[silent film]]s, monsters tended to be human-sized, e.g. [[Frankenstein's monster]], the [[Golem]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]] and [[vampire]]s. The film ''[[Sigurd|Siegfried]]'' featured a [[dragon]] that consisted of [[Stop motion|stop-motion animated]] models, as in [[RKO]]'s ''King Kong'', the first giant [[Monster movie|monster film]] of the sound era.

[[Universal Studios]] specialized in monsters, with [[Bela Lugosi]]'s reprisal of his stage role, [[Dracula]], and [[Boris Karloff]] playing [[Frankenstein]]'s monster. The studio also made several lesser films, such as ''Man-Made Monster'', starring [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] as a carnival side-show worker who is turned into an electrically charged killer, able to dispatch victims merely by touching them, causing death by electrocution.

There was also a variant of Dr. Frankenstein, the mad surgeon Dr. Gogol (played by [[Peter Lorre]]), who transplanted hands that were reanimated with malevolent temperaments, in the film ''[[Mad Love (1935 film)|Mad Love]]''.


[[Werewolf|Werewolves]] were introduced in films during this period, and similar creatures were presented in ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]''. [[mummy|Mummies]] were cinematically depicted as fearsome monsters as well. As for giant creatures, the cliffhanger of the first episode of the 1936 ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[Serial (film)|serial]] did not use a costumed actor, instead using real-life [[lizard]]s to depict a pair of battling dragons via use of camera perspective. However, the cliffhanger of the ninth episode of the same serial had a man in a rubber suit play the Fire Dragon, which picks up a doll representing Flash in its claws. The cinematic monster cycle eventually wore thin, having a comedic turn in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948).
FRANKENSTEIN

====Post–World War II monster films====
[[File:Gojira 1954 poster 3.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Original ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' film poster]]
In the [[Aftermath of World War II|post–World War II]] era, however, giant monsters returned to the screen with a vigor that has been causally linked to the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s. One early example occurred in the American film ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'', which was about a [[dinosaur]] that attacked a lighthouse. Subsequently, there were [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] film depictions, ([[Godzilla]], [[Gamera]]), British depictions (''[[Gorgo (film)|Gorgo]]''), and even [[Cinema of Denmark|Danish]] depictions (''[[Reptilicus]]''), of giant monsters attacking cities. A recent depiction of a giant monster is depicted in [[J. J. Abrams]]'s ''[[Cloverfield]]'', which was released in theaters January 18, 2008. The intriguing proximity of other [[planet]]s brought the notion of extraterrestrial monsters to the big screen, some of which were huge in size (such as [[King Ghidorah]] and [[Gigan]]), while others were of a more human scale. During this period, the [[fish]]-man monster [[Gill-man]] was developed in the film series ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''.
[[File:Obake Karuta 4-12.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Card from the Japanese game [[Karuta|obake karuta]], c. early 19th century{{efn|Each card features a monster from [[Japanese mythology]] and a character from the [[hiragana]] syllabary.}}]]
Britain's [[Hammer Film Productions]] brought [[Color motion picture film|color]] to the monster movies in the late 1950s. Around this time, the earlier Universal films were usually shown on American television by independent stations (rather than network stations) by using announcers with strange personas, who gained legions of young fans. Although they have since changed considerably, movie monsters did not entirely disappear from the big screen as they did in the late 1940s.

Occasionally, monsters are depicted as friendly or misunderstood creatures. King Kong and Frankenstein's monster are two examples of misunderstood creatures. Frankenstein's monster is frequently depicted in this manner, in films such as ''[[Monster Squad]]'' and ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]''. The Hulk is an example of the "Monster as Hero" archetype. The theme of the "Friendly Monster" is pervasive in pop-culture. [[Chewbacca]], [[Elmo]], and [[Shrek]] are notable examples of friendly "monsters". The creatures of ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' scare children in order to create [[energy]] for running machinery, while the furry monsters of ''[[The Muppets]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]'' live in harmony with animals and humans alike. Japanese culture also commonly features monsters which are benevolent or likable, with the most famous examples being the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise and the pioneering anime ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''. The book series/webisodes/toy line of [[Monster High]] is another example.
{{clear left}}

===Games===
Monsters are commonly encountered in fantasy or role-playing games and video games as enemies for players to fight against. They may include [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s, [[legendary creature]]s, extra-dimensional entities or [[mutant|mutated]] versions of regular animals.

Especially in role-playing games, "monster" is a catch-all term for hostile characters that are fought by the player. [[Sentience|Sentient]] [[race (fantasy)|fictional races]] are usually not referred to as monsters. At other times, the term can carry a neutral connotation, such as in the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise, where it is used to refer to fictional creatures that resemble real-world animals/objects. Characters in games may refer to all animals as "monsters".

==Early life==
Muhammad Taqi Usmani was born on 5 October 1943&lt;ref name=fsc&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of Justice Maulana Muhammad Taqi Usmani|publisher=Federal Shariat Court, Pakistan|accessdate=20 July 2017|url=http://federalshariatcourt.gov.pk/images/Former%20CJ_Jug_Reg_Immages/fj6.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; (5 Shawwal 1362 AH) in [[Deoband]], a city in the [[Saharanpur district]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=albalagh&gt;[http://www.albalagh.net/taqi.shtml Profile of Muhammad Taqi Usmani on albalagh.net website], Retrieved 20 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Usmani passed the Fazil-e-Arabi (Arabic language examination) with distinction, administered by the Punjab Board.&lt;ref name=fsc/&gt; In 1959 he graduated from the [[Ulama|`Alim]] course at [[Darul Uloom Karachi]].&lt;ref name="Brian Kettell p 28"&gt;Brian Kettell, Introduction to Islamic Banking and Finance, p 28. {{ISBN|047097804X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ijara&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Finance Scholars|url=http://ijaraloans.com/?p=91|publisher=IjaraLoans.com|date= 30 June 2014|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then specialised in ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence) under the guidance of his father,&lt;ref name=albalagh/&gt; the Mufti of Darul Uloom Karachi, [[Muhammad Shafi (scholar)|Muhammad Shafi]], receiving his ''Takhassus'' degree (equivalent to a PhD) in ''fiqh'' and ''ifta'' (issuance of Islamic legal opinions) from Darul Uloom Karachi in 1961, earning the title of ''Mufti''. He graduated from the [[University of Karachi]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1964, then received a [[Bachelor of Laws]] with distinction from the University of Karachi in 1967. He received a [[Master of Arts]] in [[Arabic literature]], with distinction, from the [[University of Punjab]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=ijara/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian B. Kettell, Introduction to Islamic Banking and Finance, p 28. {{ISBN|1119990602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usmani received ''ijaza'' to teach hadith from Islamic scholars including [[Muhammad Shafi (scholar)|Muhammad Shafi]], [[Muhammad Idris Kandhlawi]], [[Qari Muhammad Tayyib]], Saleemullah Khan, Mufti Rashid Ahmad Ludhianvi, Sahban Mahmud, Zafar Ahmad Usmani, [[Muhammad Zakariya Kandhalvi]], Hasan al-Mahshat, [[Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghudda]]h, Abi Al-Faid [[:id:Muhammad Yasin Al-Fadani|Muhammad Yasin Al-Fadani]] Ash-[[Shafi'i]], and others.&lt;ref name=albalagh/&gt;

His Teachers also include Mufti Wali Hasan Tonki, the Grand Mufti of Jami' ul Uloom Al-Islamiyyah. He admired the academic methods of [[Mufti]] [[Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghudda]]h, of whom he wrote an Orbituary to after his demise in his Nuqoosh-e-Raftghaan. He is very close friends with his teacher's nephew Dr. 'Abdu-s-Sattar Abu Ghuddah.

In tradition to the scholars of Deoband, recognising the importance of Tasawwuf, he traversed the path under the guidance of his Shaikh Dr. Abdul Hai Arifi and Maulana [[Muhammad Masihullah Khan]]  both khulafa of Hakeemul Ummat Maulana [[Ashraf Ali Thanwi]].&lt;ref name=TheMuslim500/&gt; He is authorized by both of his mentors in Silsila e Ashrafia: Chistiyyah, Naqshbandiyah, Qadiriyah and Suharwardiyah. In addition to his busy schedule he is himself a mentor to numerous spiritual aspirants all over the world, such as Moulana Sheikh Mohammad Luqman Sahib Ji of the renowned Abu Bakr Trust in Walsall, England.

Usmani pioneered the concept of [[Islamic banking]] in Pakistan when he established the [[Meezan Bank]]. Usmani has authored a number of books in Arabic, Urdu, and [[English language|English]] on Islamic topics in addition to a large number of articles on [[Islamic banking]] and [[Islamic finance|finance]] published in a number of journals and magazines. According to ''The Muslim 500'' website, he is a leading scholar of Islamic Finance, "Usmani's chief influence comes from his position as a global authority on the issue of Islamic finance."&lt;ref name=TheMuslim500/&gt;

In March 2004, [[United Arab Emirates]] Vice President and Prime Minister [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] presented an award to Taqi Usmani in recognition of his lifetime service and achievement in [[Islamic finance]] during the annual ''International Islamic Finance Forum'' (IIFF) in [[Dubai]].{{Citation needed|date= October 2011}}

In accordance with the tradition of the scholars of [[Deoband]] and recognising the importance of ''tasawwuf'', Usmani's ''bay'ah'' was accepted by Abdul Hai Arifi and [[Muhammad Masihullah Khan]]. Usmani is currently a mentor to numerous spiritual aspirants all over the world and delivers weekly lectures on self-improvement at [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] on Sundays between [[Asr|Asr Salaah]] and [[Maghrib|Maghrib Salaah]].&lt;ref name=ashrafiya&gt;[https://www.ashrafiya.com/sayyidi-mawlana-mohammad-taqi-usmani-db/ Profile of Muhammad Taqi Usmani on ashrafiya.com website], Retrieved 23 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

He currently teaches [[Sahih Bukhari|Sahih al-Bukhari]], fiqh, and [[Islamic economics]] at [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] and is known for his ''Islahi Khutbat''. He was a key member of a team of scholars which helped declare [[Ahmadis]] non-Muslims by Pakistan's National Assembly during the era of former Pakistani president, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], in the 1970s. During the presidency of General [[Zia ul Haq]], he was instrumental in drafting laws pertaining to ''[[Hudood]]'', ''[[Qisas]]'' meaning ''retaliation in kind'' or ([[eye for an eye]], and ''[[Diyya]]'' (blood money).

==Views==
Usmani strongly opposes elements of modernity, which he describes as engulfing

&lt;blockquote&gt;"the whole world in the tornado of nudity and obscenity, and has provided an excuse for fornication, and more so it has led under thunder claps to the passage of a bill in the British House of Commons to legalize homosexuality. It is in the shadow of the same modernity that Western women are openly displaying banners on the streets demanding legalization of abortion ....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/IslamAndModernismByMuftiTaqiUsmani/42345132-Islam-and-Modernism_djvu.txt |page=6 |last1=Taqi Usmani |first1=Muhammad |title=Islam and Modernism |accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also strongly supports Pakistan's [[Hudood Ordinances]] he helped write and strongly opposed the [[Women's Protection Bill]], which he believes violates the injunctions of Quran and Sunnah. He thinks it will not provide a great relief to countless women.

At a religious conference in 1984 he urged a more "dynamic attitude" towards the practice of ''[[ijtihad]]'', arguing there is no shortage of fine minds capable of interpreting the sharia, but warning against the contamination of sharia by Western ideas such as the elimination of [[hudood]] penalties such as amputation and [[stoning]].&lt;ref name=kadri-228&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|pages=228–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usmani&gt;{{cite web|last1=Usmani|first1=Taqi|title=THE ISLAMIC WAY OF LIFE.

'''Nalini Nadkarni''' (born 1954 in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]) is an American [[ecologist]] who pioneered the study of [[Costa Rica]]n [[rain forest]] [[canopy (biology)|canopies]]. Using [[mountaineering|mountain climbing]] equipment to make her ascent, Nadkarni first took an inventory of the canopy in 1981, followed by two more inventories in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Nadkarni, N.M. 1981. Canopy Roots: Convergent Evolution in Rainforest Nutrient Cycles. ''Science'', 214: 1023 - 1024&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Nadkarni's interest was first drawn to [[forest ecology|rain forest ecology]] due to the contradiction offered by its plant life.  There was a great abundance and variety of plant life within the rain forest despite its nutrient poor soil, and her goal was to discover how the plant life was sustained.  Her studies within the canopy revealed that the [[epiphyte]]s, which are non-parasitic plants such as [[orchid]]s and [[fern]]s that live on the branches and trunks of other plants, were trapping organic material beneath their root system.  This organic material eventually formed a nutrient rich mat, and trees in the rain forest had developed aerial roots, stemming from their trunks and branches, in order to absorb these nutrients as well. The aerial roots growing into the mats aided the rain forest trees by providing the nourishment that they did not receive from the nutrient poor soil.

Nadkarni and her work in the Costa Rican rain forest were featured in the 1988 [[PBS]] series, ''[[The Second Voyage of the Mimi]]'', starring a young [[Ben Affleck]]. She maintains an interest in public outreach, and her work was highlighted on the web page of the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=114406|title=More and More Scientists Serve Up Science for Mass Consumption {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|last=Whiteman|first=Lily|date=2009-03-16|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the author of ''Between Earth and Sky: Our Intimate Connections to Trees''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520261655|title=Between Earth and Sky|last=Nadkarni|first=Nalini|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=9780520261655|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has delivered TED Talks on Conserving the Canopy&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nadkarni|first=Nalini|title=Conserving the canopy|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/nalini_nadkani_on_conserving_the_canopy|language=en|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Life Science in Prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nadkarni|first=Nalini|title=Life science in prison|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/nalini_nadkarni_life_science_in_prison?language=en|language=en|accessdate=|Website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote some text (foreword and quotes) for a book for young explorers entitled, ''Kingfisher Voyages: Rain Forest'', published in 2006.

Brady]], into the forest canopy to write and perform.&lt;ref&gt;Dell'Amore, Christine. 2013. [https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130801-nalini-nadkarni-nature-science-environment/].

[https://mobile.nytimes.com/2003/09/23/science/making-science-rock-roll-and-swing-from-the-treetops.html]. "Making Science Rock, Roll and Swing From the Treetops". Dr. Nadkarni is interviewed about making a "Treetop Barbie", bringing a hip hop musician to perform at a scientific conference, and recruiting "research ambassadors" to disseminate scientific information to the public.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Emeritus Professor at [[The Evergreen State College]], she currently is a professor in the Department of Biology and the director of the Center for Science and Mathematics Education at the [[University of Utah]].

==Personal life==
Nadkarni was born in Bethesda, Maryland, the third child to Moreshwar and Goldie Nadkarni. Her father immigrated to [[Iowa]] from [[Thane]], [[India]], while her mother is a [[Jewish]] [[Brooklyn]] native of [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] descent. She has three living siblings-sister Saroj and brothers Vinay and Mohan. Another sister, Susheela, died in 1994.
Nadkarni attended [[Brown University]] for her undergraduate degree and received a Ph.D. from the [[University of Washington]]. She is married to [[Myrmecology|myrmecologist]] Jack Longino, who is also a professor at the [[University of Utah]]. They have two children.

==Honors and awards==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3756">[[File:Northern Hardwood Forest (1) (21178820598).jpg|thumb|Austin T. Blakeslee Natural Area, [[Monroe County, Pennsylvania]].]]

The '''northern hardwood forest''' is a general type of [[North America]]n forest ecosystem found over much of southeastern and south central [[Canada]], Ontario and Quebec, extending south into the [[United States]] in northern [[New England]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Pennsylvania]], and west along the [[Great Lakes]] to [[Minnesota]] and western [[Ontario]]. Some ecologists consider it a [[transitional forest]] because it contains species common to both the [[oak-hickory forest]] community to the south and the [[Boreal forest]] community to the north. The trees and shrub species of the Northern Hardwood Forest are known for their brilliant fall colors, making the regions that contain this forest type popular [[fall foliage]] tourist destinations. 

[[Sugar maple]], [[yellow birch]], [[American beech]], and [[Fraxinus americana|White Ash]] are the common key indicator tree and shrub species in the Northern Hardwood Forest. Other species include [[Tsuga canadensis|eastern hemlock]] and [[eastern white pine]]. Herb and heath species include [[wintergreen]], [[wild sarsaparilla]], and [[wood sorrel]]. Birds and animals common to the Northern Hardwood Forest include the [[black-capped chickadee]], [[white-throated sparrow]], [[cedar waxwing]], [[porcupine]], [[snowshoe hare]], [[white-tailed deer]], and [[American Red Squirrel]]. 

Most of the Northern Hardwood Forest is not [[virgin forest]], it is regrowth following centuries of commercial timber harvesting and the clearing of land for agricultural purposes. This is particularly true of New England, New York, and Eastern Canada, where the land was cleared to make room for farms in the 17th and 18th centuries and subsequently abandoned in the 19th century when farming interests migrated to the midwestern United States and central Canada. 

The Northern Hardwood Forest is indigenous to several well-known parks and national forests, including the [[Boundary Waters]] region of Minnesota, New York's [[Adirondack Park]], the [[White Mountain National Forest]] in New Hampshire, the [[Green Mountain National Forest]] in Vermont, [[Baxter State Park]] and [[Acadia National Park]] in Maine, and [[Fundy National Park]] in [[New Brunswick]]. The [[Berkshires]] region of western [[Massachusetts]] is very typical of a Northern Hardwood Forest ecosystem.  Northern hardwood stands are also found in the higher elevations of the southern [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], typically between {{convert|4500|ft|m}} and {{convert|5500|ft|m}}, where climatic conditions resemble those in northern states and southern Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9161">'''Numerical algebraic geometry''' is a field of [[computational mathematics]], particularly [[computational algebraic geometry]], which uses methods from [[numerical analysis]] to study and manipulate algebraic varieties on a computer.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Hauenstein, Andrew J. Sommese, What is numerical algebraic geometry?, Journal of Symbolic Computation, Volume 79, Part 3, March–April 2017, pages 499–507&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www3.nd.edu/~cwample1/Preprints/intro2AlgGeom.pdf |title=Introduction to Numerical Algebraic Geometry |last=Sommese |first=Andrew J. |last2=Verschelde |first2=Jan |last3=Wampler |first3=Charles W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Homotopy continuation==
{{see also|System of polynomial equations#Homotopy continuation}}
{{see also|Numerical continuation}}
The primary computational method used in numerical algebraic geometry is homotopy continuation, in which a [[homotopy]] is formed between two polynomial systems, and the isolated solutions (points) of one are continued to the other. This is a specification of the more general method of [[numerical continuation]].

Let &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; represent the variables of the system.  By abuse of notation, and to facilitate the spectrum of ambient spaces over which one can solve system, we do not use vector notation for &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly for the polynomial systems &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

Current canonical notation calls the start system &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, and the target system – the system to solve – &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Sommese, Charles W. Wampler, The Numerical Solution of Systems of Polynomials Arising in Engineering and Science, World Scientific, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Bates, Jonathan D. Hauenstein, Andrew J. Sommese, Charles W. Wampler, Numerically solving polynomial systems with Bertini, SIAM, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  A very common homotopy, the straight-line homotopy, between &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math display="block"&gt; H(z,t) = (1-t) f(z) + t g(z).&lt;/math&gt;

In the above homotopy, one starts the path variable at &lt;math&gt;t_{\text{start}} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and continues toward &lt;math&gt;t_{\text{end}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Another common choice is to run from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.  In principle, the choice is completely arbitrary.  In practice, regarding endgame methods for computing singular solutions using homotopy continuation, the target time being &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; can significantly ease analysis, so this perspective is here taken.{{Citation needed|reason=need a citation indicating that the analysis is actually easier with target time 0|date=January 2017}}  

Regardless of the choice of start and target times, the &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; ought to be formulated such that &lt;math&gt;H(z, t_{\text{start}}) = g(z)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;H(z, t_{\text{end}}) = f(z)&lt;/math&gt;.

One has a choice in &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt;, including

* Roots of unity
* Total degree
* Polyhedral
* Multi-homogeneous

and beyond these, specific [[Start system|start systems]] that closely mirror the structure of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; may be formed for particular systems.  The choice of start system impacts the computational time it takes to solve &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, in that those that are easy to formulate (such as total degree) tend to have higher numbers of paths to track, and those that take significant effort (such as the polyhedral method) are much sharper.  There is currently no good way to predict which will lead to the quickest time to solve.{{Citation needed|reason=need a source indicating this please|date=January 2017}}

Actual continuation is typically done using [[predictor–corrector method]]s, with additional features as implemented.  Predicting is done using a standard [[ordinary differential equation|ODE]] predictor method, such as [[Runge–Kutta]], and correction often uses Newton–Raphson iteration.

Because &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are polynomial, homotopy continuation in this context is theoretically guaranteed to compute all solutions of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, due to [[Theorem of Bertini|Bertini's theorem]].  However, this guarantee is not always achieved in practice, because of issues arising from limitations of the modern computer, most namely finite precision.  That is, despite the strength of the probability-1 argument underlying this theory, without using a priori certified tracking methods, some paths may fail to track perfectly for various reasons.

==Witness set==
A witness set 
&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a data structure used to describe [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]]. The witness set for an affine variety that is equidimensional consists of three pieces of information. The first piece of information is a system of equations &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. These equations define the algebraic variety &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt; that is being studied. The second piece of information is a linear space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;. The dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the codimension of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt;, and chosen to intersect &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt; transversely. The third piece of information is the list of points in the intersection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\cap{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt;. This intersection has finitely many points and the number of points is the degree of the algebraic variety &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, witness sets encode the answer to the first two questions one asks about an algebraic variety: What is the dimension, and what is the degree? Witness sets also allow one to perform a numerical irreducible decomposition, component membership tests, and component sampling. This makes witness sets a good description of an algebraic variety.

==Certification==

Solutions to polynomial systems computed using numerical algebraic geometric methods can be certified, meaning that the approximate solution is "correct".  This can be achieved in several ways, either a priori using a certified tracker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beltrán|first=Carlos|last2=Leykin|first2=Anton|date=2012-03-01|title=Certified Numerical Homotopy Tracking|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2011.606184|journal=Experimental Mathematics|volume=21|issue=1|pages=69–83|doi=10.1080/10586458.2011.606184|issn=1058-6458|arxiv=0912.0920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beltrán|first=Carlos|last2=Leykin|first2=Anton|date=2013-02-01|title=Robust Certified Numerical Homotopy Tracking|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-013-9143-2|journal=Foundations of Computational Mathematics|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=253–295|doi=10.1007/s10208-013-9143-2|issn=1615-3375|arxiv=1105.5992}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a posteriori by showing that the point is, say, in the basin of convergence for Newton's method.&lt;ref name = "alphaCertified"&gt;Hauenstein, Jonathan D., and Sottile, Frank.

==Theorem Star==
Often researchers use results from both probabilistic symbolic computations and numerical computations to prove theorems. The notation ''Theorem Star'' is often used to indicate the reliance on such computations. 
     ''Our methods include probabilistic symbolic computations and numerical computations. Though they have been carefully tested and produce completely reproducible results, they are technically only true with high probability, or up to the numerical precision of the computers we use. To indicate reliance on such computations, we designate those theorems, corollaries, and propositions with a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oeding|first1=Luke|last2=Sam|first2=Steven|title=Equations for the fifth secant variety of Segre products of projective spaces|journal=Experimental Mathematics|date=2016|volume=25|issue=1|page=94--99|doi=10.1080/10586458.2015.1037872|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10586458.2015.1037872|arxiv=1502.00203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10265">A '''piping and instrumentation diagram''' ('''P&amp;ID''') is a detailed diagram in the [[process industry]] which shows the [[piping]] and [[pressure vessel|vessel]]s in the process flow, together with the [[instrumentation]] and control devices.

Superordinate to the ''piping and instrumentation flowsheet'' is the ''[[process flow diagram]] (PFD)'' which indicates the more general flow of plant processes and equipment and relationship between major equipment of a plant facility.

==Contents and function==
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]
[[Image:Pump with tank pid en.svg|thumb|Piping and instrumentation diagram of pump with storage tank. Symbols according to EN ISO 10628 and EN 62424.]]
[[Image:P&amp;ID.JPG|thumb|300px|A more complex example of a '''P&amp;ID'''.]]
A piping and instrumentation diagram (P&amp;ID) is defined by the Institute of Instrumentation and Control as follows:
# A diagram which shows the interconnection of process equipment and the instrumentation used to control the process. In the process industry, a standard set of symbols is used to prepare drawings of processes. The instrument symbols used in these drawings are generally based on [[International Society of Automation]] (ISA) Standard S5.1
# The primary schematic drawing used for laying out a [[process control]] installation.

They usually contain the following information:
*Process piping, sizes and identification, including:
**Pipe classes or piping line numbers
**Flow directions
**Interconnections references 
**Permanent start-up, flush and bypass lines
*Mechanical equipment and process control instrumentation and designation (names, numbers, unique tag identifiers), including:
**Valves and their identifications (e.g. isolation, shutoff, relief and [[safety valve]]s)
**Control inputs and outputs ([[sensor]]s and final elements, interlocks) 
**Miscellaneous - vents, drains, [[flange]]s, special fittings, sampling lines, reducers and increasers &lt;!-- and swagers  &lt;&lt; I could not find any references to "swager" in this context. What is a "swager"?--&gt;
*Interfaces for class changes 
*Computer control system 
*Identification of components and subsystems delivered by others

P&amp;IDs are originally drawn up at the design stage from a combination of process flow sheet data, the mechanical process equipment design, and the instrumentation engineering design.  During the design stage, the diagram also provides the basis for the development of system control schemes, allowing for further safety and operational investigations, such as a [[Hazard and operability study]] (HAZOP). To do this, it is critical to demonstrate the physical sequence of equipment and systems, as well as how these systems connect.

P&amp;IDs also play a significant role in the maintenance and modification of the process after initial build. Modifications are red-penned onto the diagrams and are vital records of the current plant design.

They are also vital in enabling development of;
*Control and shutdown schemes
*Safety and regulatory requirements
*Start-up sequences
*Operational understanding.

P&amp;IDs form the basis for the live mimic diagrams displayed on [[graphical user interface]]s of large [[industrial control system]]s such as [[SCADA]] and [[distributed control system]]s.

==Identification and reference designation==
Based on STANDARD [[ANSI]]/[[Instrument Society of America|ISA]] S5.1 and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 14617-6, the P&amp;ID is used for the identification of measurements within the process. The identifications consist of up to 5 letters. The first identification letter is for the measured value, the second is a modifier, 3rd indicates passive/readout function, 4th - active/output function, and the 5th is the function modifier. This is followed by loop number, which is unique to that loop. For instance FIC045 means it is the Flow Indicating Controller in control loop 045. This is also known as the "tag" identifier of the field device, which is normally given to the location and function of the instrument. The same loop may have FT045 - which is the flow transmitter in the same loop.

For reference designation of any equipment in industrial systems the standard [[IEC 61346]] (''Industrial systems, installations and equipment and industrial products — Structuring principles and reference designations'') can be applied. For the function  ''Measurement'' the reference designator '''B''' is used, followed by the above listed letter for the measured variable.

For reference designation of any equipment in a power station the [[KKS Power Plant Classification System]] can be applied.

'''Plant defense against herbivory''' or '''host-plant resistance''' ('''HPR''') describes a range of [[adaptation]]s [[Evolution |evolved]] by [[plants]] which improve their [[fitness (biology) |survival and reproduction]] by reducing the impact of [[herbivore]]s. [[Plant perception (physiology) |Plants can sense being touched]],&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Jade (2012). "A bit touchy: Plants' insect defenses activated by touch". Rice University. http://news.rice.edu/2012/04/09/a-bit-touchy-plants-insect-defenses-activated-by-touch-2/&lt;/ref&gt; and they can use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores. Many plants produce [[secondary metabolites]], known as [[Heterotelergones|allelochemicals]], that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility.

Other defensive strategies used by plants include escaping or avoiding herbivores in any time and/or any place, for example by growing in a location where plants are not easily found or accessed by herbivores, or by changing seasonal growth patterns. Another approach diverts herbivores toward eating non-essential parts, or enhances the ability of a plant to recover from the damage caused by herbivory. Some plants encourage the presence of [[predator |natural enemies]] of herbivores, which in turn protect the plant. Each type of defense can be either ''constitutive'' (always present in the plant), or [[Inducible plant defenses against herbivory |''induced'']] (produced in reaction to damage or stress caused by herbivores).

Historically, insects have been the most significant herbivores, and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defenses are directed against insects, other defenses have evolved that are aimed at [[vertebrate]] herbivores, such as [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s. The study of plant defenses against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary view point, but also in the direct impact that these defenses have on [[agriculture]], including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial 'biological control agents' in [[biological pest control]] programs; as well as in the search for [[medicinal plants |plants of medical importance]].

==Evolution of defensive traits==
[[File:InsectPlantEvol.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Timeline of plant evolution and the beginnings of different modes of insect herbivory]]
{{main|Evolutionary history of plants}}

The earliest land plants evolved from aquatic plants around {{Ma |450}} (Ma) in the [[Ordovician]] period. Many plants have adapted to iodine-deficient terrestrial environment by removing iodine from their metabolism, in fact iodine is essential only for animal cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=727–9 |doi=10.1089/10507250050137851 |title=Environmental Iodine Deficiency: A Challenge to the Evolution of Terrestrial Life? |year=2000 |last1=Venturi |first1=S. |last2=Donati |first2=F.M. |last3=Venturi |first3=A. |last4=Venturi |first4=M. |journal=Thyroid |volume=10 |issue=8 |pmid=11014322}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important antiparasitic action is caused by the block of the transport of iodide of animal cells inhibiting [[sodium-iodide symporter]] (NIS). Many plant pesticides are glycosides (as the cardiac [[digitoxin]]) and [[cyanogenic glycosides]] which liberate [[cyanide]], which, blocking [[cytochrome c oxidase]] and [[Sodium-iodide symporter |NIS]], is poisonous only for a large part of parasites and herbivores and not for the plant cells in which it seems useful in [[seed dormancy]] phase. Iodide is not pesticide, but is oxidized, by vegetable peroxidase, to iodine, which is a strong oxidant, it is able to kill bacteria, fungi and protozoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Venturi, Sebastiano |title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine |journal=Current Chemical Biology- |volume=5 |pages=155–162 |year=2011 |doi=10.2174/187231311796765012 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cretaceous]] period saw the appearance of more plant defense mechanisms. The diversification of flowering plants ([[angiosperm]]s) at that time is associated with the sudden burst of [[speciation]] in insects.&lt;ref name=Ehrlich&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ehrlich |first1=Paul R. |author2=Peter H. Raven |date=December 1964 |title=Butterflies and plants: a study of coevolution. |journal=Evolution | volume=18 | issue=4 |pages=586–608 |doi=10.2307/2406212 |publisher=Society for the Study of Evolution |jstor=2406212}}&lt;/ref&gt; This diversification of insects represented a major selective force in plant evolution, and led to selection of plants that had defensive adaptations. Early insect herbivores were [[mandibulate]] and bit or chewed vegetation; but the evolution of vascular plants lead to the co-evolution of other forms of herbivory, such as sap-sucking, [[Leaf miner |leaf mining]], [[gall]] forming and nectar-feeding.&lt;ref name=Labandeira&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Labandeira |first1=C.C. |author2=D.L. Dilcher, D.R. Davis, D.L. Wagner |title=Ninety-seven million years of angiosperm-insect association: paleobiological insights into the meaning of coevolution |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/91/25/12278.pdf |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=91 |issue=25 |pages=12278–82 |year=1994 |pmid=11607501 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.25.12278 |pmc=45420 |bibcode=1994PNAS...9112278L |last3=Davis |first3=D. R. |last4=Wagner |first4=D. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative abundance of different species of plants in ecological communities including forests and grasslands may be determined in part by the level of defensive compounds in the different species.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2007. [https://www.amazon.com/Plants-Vegetation-Origins-Processes-Consequences/dp/0521864801 Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes, Consequences]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 666 p. Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the cost of replacement of damaged leaves is higher in conditions where resources are scarce, it may also be that plants growing in areas where water and nutrients are scarce may invest more resources into anti-herbivore defenses.

Our understanding of herbivory in geological time comes from three sources: fossilized plants, which may preserve evidence of defense (such as spines), or herbivory-related damage; the observation of plant debris in fossilised [[coprolite |animal faeces]]; and the construction of herbivore mouthparts.&lt;ref name=Labandeira1998&gt;{{cite journal | author=Labandeira, C.C. | year=1998 | title=Early History Of Arthropod And Vascular Plant Associations 1 | journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | volume=26 | issue=1 | pages=329–377 | doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.26.1.329 |bibcode=1998AREPS..26..329L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long thought to be a [[Mesozoic]] phenomenon, evidence for herbivory is found almost as soon as fossils which could show it. As previously discussed, the first land plants emerged around 450 million years ago; however, herbivory, and therefore the need for plant defenses, has undoubtedly been around for longer. Herbivory first evolved due to marine organisms within ancient lakes and oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ecological Relationships of Plants and Animals |last=Howe |first=Henry F. |last2=Westley |first2=Lynn C. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-19-504431-2 |location=New York |pages=29 |quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within under 20 million years of the first fossils of sporangia and stems towards the close of the Silurian, around {{Ma |{{period start |devonian |-1}}}}, there is evidence that they were being consumed.&lt;ref name=Labandeira2007&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Labandeira, C. | year=2007

During the ensuing 75 million years, plants evolved a range of more complex organs – from roots to seeds. There was a gap of 50 to 100 million years between each organ evolving, and it being fed upon.&lt;ref name=Labandeira2007/&gt; Hole feeding and skeletonization are recorded in the early Permian, with surface fluid feeding evolving by the end of that period.&lt;ref name=Labandeira1998/&gt;

===Co-evolution===

Herbivores are dependent on plants for food, and have evolved mechanisms to obtain this food despite the evolution of a diverse arsenal of plant defenses. [[Herbivore adaptations to plant defense]] have been likened to ''offensive traits'' and consist of adaptations that allow increased feeding and use of a host plant.&lt;ref name=Karban&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Karban |first1=Richard |author2=Anurag A.

When an herbivore eats a plant it [[evolutionary pressure |selects]] for plants that can mount a defensive response. In cases where this relationship demonstrates ''specificity'' (the evolution of each trait is due to the other), and ''reciprocity'' (both traits must evolve), the species are thought to have co-evolved.&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Futuyma |first1=Douglas J. |author2=Montgomery Slatkin |title=Coevolution |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |year=1983 |isbn=0-87893-228-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "escape and radiation" mechanism for co-evolution presents the idea that adaptations in herbivores and their host plants have been the driving force behind [[speciation]],&lt;ref name=Ehrlich/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{Cite book |last=Thompson |first=J. |editor=H.

==Types==
Plant defenses can be classified generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive defenses are always present in the plant, while induced defenses are produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative defenses are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Traw |first1=Brian M. |author2=Todd E.

The evolution of chemical defenses in plants is linked to the emergence of chemical substances that are not involved in the essential photosynthetic and metabolic activities.

===Qualitative and quantitative metabolites===

Secondary metabolites are often characterized as either ''[[qualitative property|qualitative]]'' or ''[[quantitative property|quantitative]]''. Qualitative metabolites are defined as [[toxins]] that interfere with a herbivore's metabolism, often by blocking specific biochemical reactions. Qualitative chemicals are present in plants in relatively low concentrations (often less than 2% dry weight), and are not dosage dependent. They are usually small, water-soluble molecules, and therefore can be rapidly synthesized, transported and stored with relatively little energy cost to the plant. Qualitative allelochemicals are usually effective against non-adapted [[generalist and specialist species |generalist]] herbivores.

Quantitative chemicals are those that are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most quantitative metabolites are digestibility reducers that make plant [[cell wall]]s indigestible to animals. The effects of quantitative metabolites are dosage dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.&lt;ref name="theis"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Theis |first1=Nina |author2=Manuel Lerdau |year=2003 |title=The evolution of function in plant secondary metabolites |journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences |volume=164 |issue=3 Suppl. |pages=S93–S102 |url=http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/mlerdau/Papers/Theis2003.pdf |doi=10.1086/374190 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418020403/http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/mlerdau/Papers/Theis2003.pdf |archivedate=2007-04-18 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pelargonium |geranium]], for example, produces a unique chemical compound in its petals to defend itself from [[Japanese beetles]]. Within 30 minutes of ingestion the chemical paralyzes the herbivore. While the chemical usually wears off within a few hours, during this time the beetle is often consumed by its own predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/mar10/garden0310.htm |title=Geraniums and Begonias |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Antiherbivory compounds ====
{{further|Medicinal plants}}

Plants have evolved many secondary metabolites involved in plant defense, which are collectively known as antiherbivory compounds and can be classified into three sub-groups: [[nitrogen]] compounds (including ''alkaloids'', ''cyanogenic glycosides'', ''glucosinolates'' and ''benzoxazinoids''), terpenoids, and phenolics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.mcdaniel.edu/Biology/botf99/herbnew/aprodbc.htm |title=Biochemical defenses: secondary metabolites |accessdate=2007-05-21 |work=Plant Defense Systems &amp; Medicinal Botany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alkaloid]]s are derived from various [[amino acid]]s. Over 3000 known alkaloids exist, examples include [[nicotine]], [[caffeine]], [[morphine]], [[cocaine]], [[colchicine]], [[ergoline]]s, [[strychnine]], and [[quinine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.mcdaniel.edu/Biology/botf99/herbnew/alkaloids.htm |title=Alkaloids: contain a N-containing heterocycle |accessdate=2007-06-26 |work=Plant Defense Systems &amp; Medicinal Botany}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkaloids have [[pharmacological]] effects on humans and other animals. Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate [[enzyme]]s, or alter [[carbohydrate]] and fat storage by inhibiting the formation [[phosphodiester]] bonds involved in their breakdown.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Margaret F. |last1=Roberts |author2=Michael Wink |title=Alkaloids: biochemistry, ecology, and medicinal applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMCzyrAtrvYC&amp;dq |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=0-306-45465-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain alkaloids bind to [[nucleic acid]]s and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect [[DNA repair]] mechanisms.

[[Cyanogenic glycoside]]s are stored in inactive forms in plant [[vacuole]]s. They become toxic when herbivores eat the plant and break cell membranes allowing the glycosides to come into contact with [[enzyme]]s in the [[cytoplasm]] releasing [[hydrogen cyanide]] which blocks cellular respiration.&lt;ref&gt;Toxicon Volume 38, Issue 1, January 2000, Pages 11-36 János Vetter Plant cyanogenic glycosides {{doi |10.1016/S0041-0101(99)00128-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glucosinolates]] are activated in much the same way as cyanogenic glucosides, and the products can cause [[gastroenteritis]], salivation, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth.&lt;ref name=Rhoades1979/&gt; [[Benzoxazinoids]], secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses ([[Poaceae]]), are also stored as inactive glucosides in the plant vacuole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Niemeyer |first=HM |title=Hydroxamic acids derived from 2-hydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one: key defense chemicals of cereals |journal=J Agric Food Chem |year=2009 |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=1677–1696 |doi=10.1021/jf8034034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon tissue disruption they get into contact with β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones.

Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene units, are widely distributed in [[latex]] and [[resins]], and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making ''[[Rhododendron]]'' leaves poisonous. Plant [[steroid]]s and [[sterol]]s are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including [[vitamin D]], [[glycosides]] (such as [[digitalis]]) and [[saponin]]s (which lyse [[red blood cell]]s of herbivores).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Albert T. |last=Sneden |url=http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/terpenes.htm |title=Terpenes |accessdate=2007-05-21 |work=Natural Products as Medicinally Useful Agents |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716022711/http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/terpenes.htm |archivedate=2007-07-16 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenolics, sometimes called ''phenols'', consist of an [[aromatic]] 6-carbon ring bonded to a [[Hydroxyl |hydroxy]] group. Some phenols have [[antiseptic]] properties, while others disrupt [[endocrine]] activity. Phenolics range from simple [[tannin]]s to the more complex [[flavonoid]]s that give plants much of their red, blue, yellow, and white pigments. Complex phenolics called [[polyphenol]]s are capable of producing many different types of effects on humans, including [[polyphenol antioxidant |antioxidant]] properties. Some examples of phenolics used for defense in plants are: [[lignin]], [[silymarin]] and [[cannabinoid]]s.&lt;ref name=Phenols&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.mcdaniel.edu/Biology/botf99/herbnew/aphenols.htm |title=Phenols |accessdate=2007-05-21 |work=Plant Defense Systems &amp; Medicinal Botany}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proanthocyanidin |Condensed tannin]]s, polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and [[digestive enzyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Peter J. |last=Van Soest |title=Nutritional ecology of the ruminant: ruminant metabolism, nutritional strategies, the cellulolytic fermentation, and the chemistry of forages and plant fibers |publisher=O &amp; B Books |location=Corvallis, Oregon |year=1982 |isbn=0-9601586-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical defenses===
[[File:Raspberry cane - closeup in winter - P.2005.03.jpg |thumb |left |The prickles on the stem of this [[raspberry]] plant, serve as a mechanical defense against herbivory.]]

Many plants have external structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore's physical characteristics (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, injure, or kill the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant's surface; for example, [[resins]], [[lignin]]s, [[silica]], and wax cover the [[Epidermis (botany) |epidermis]] of [[terrestrial plant]]s and alter the texture of the plant tissue. The leaves of [[holly]] plants, for instance, are very smooth and slippery making feeding difficult. Some plants produce [[gummosis]] or sap that traps insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Fernandes, G.

A plant's leaves and stem may be covered with sharp prickles, spines, thorns, or [[trichomes]]- hairs on the leaf often with barbs, sometimes containing [[irritant (biology) |irritant]]s or poisons. Plant structural features like spines and thorns reduce feeding by large ungulate herbivores (e.g. [[kudu]], [[impala]], and [[Capra (genus) |goats]]) by restricting the herbivores' feeding rate, or by wearing down the molars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Cooper |first1=Susan M. |author2=Owen-Smith, Norman |date=September 1986 |title=Effects of plant spinescence on large mammalian herbivores |journal=Oecologia |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=446–455 |doi=10.1007/BF01036753|bibcode=1986Oecol..68..446C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raphides]] are sharp needles of [[calcium oxalate]] or [[calcium carbonate]] in plant tissues, making ingestion painful, damaging a herbivore's mouth and gullet and causing more efficient delivery of the plant's toxins. The structure of a plant, its branching and leaf arrangement may also be evolved to reduce herbivore impact. The shrubs of New Zealand have evolved special wide branching adaptations believed to be a response to browsing birds such as the [[moa]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Bond, W. |author2=Lee, W. |author3=Craine, J. |year=2004 |title=Plant structural defences against browsing birds: a legacy of New Zealand's extinct moas |journal=Oikos |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=500–508 |doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12720.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, African [[Acacia]]s have long spines low in the canopy, but very short spines high in the canopy, which is comparatively safe from herbivores such as giraffes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Young |first=Truman P. |year=1987 |title=Increased thorn length in ''Acacia drepanolobium''- an induced response to browsing |journal=Oecologia |volume=71 |pages=436–438 |doi=10.1007/BF00378718 |issue=3 |bibcode=1987Oecol..71..436Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Truman P. |author2=Bell Okello |year=1998 |title=Relaxation of an induced defense after exclusion of herbivores: spines on ''Acacia drepanolobium'' |journal=Oecologia |volume=115 |pages=508–513. |doi=10.1007/s004420050548 |issue=4|bibcode=1998Oecol.115..508Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cocos nucifera - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-187.jpg |thumb|upright|[[Coconut palm]]s protect their fruit by surrounding it with multiple layers of armor.]]
Trees such as palms protect their fruit by multiple layers of armor, needing efficient tools to break through to the seed contents. Some plants, notably the [[grass]]es, use indigestible [[silica]] (and many plants use other relatively indigestible materials such as [[lignin]]) to defend themselves against vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Epstein, E. | title=Silicon: its manifold roles in plants | year=2009 | journal=Annals of Applied Biology | volume=155 | pages=155–160 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-7348.2009.00343.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants take up [[silicon]] from the soil and deposit it in their tissues in the form of solid silica [[phytolith]]s.

====Thigmonastic movements====
[[Thigmonasty|Thigmonastic movements]], those that occur in response to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the [[sensitive plant]], ''Mimosa pudica'', close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The [[proximate cause]] of this mechanical response is an abrupt change in the [[turgor]] pressure in the [[pulvini]] at the base of leaves resulting from [[osmosis|osmotic]] phenomena. This is then spread via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed. This response lowers the surface area available to herbivores, which are presented with the underside of each leaflet, and results in a wilted appearance. It may also physically dislodge small herbivores, such as insects.&lt;ref name="Raven 2005"/&gt;

===Mimicry and camouflage===
{{further|Mimicry in plants}}

Some plants [[Mimicry in plants|mimic]] the presence of insect eggs on their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying their eggs there. Because female butterflies are less likely to lay their eggs on plants that already have butterfly eggs, some species of [[neotropical]] [[vine]]s of the [[genus]] ''[[Passiflora]]'' (Passion flowers) contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of ''[[Heliconius]]'' [[butterflies]] on their leaves, which discourage [[oviposition]] by butterflies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Kathy S. |author2=Lawrence E.

===Indirect defenses===
[[Image:Acacia-collinsii.jpg |thumb |left |upright |The large and directly defensive thorn-like stipules of ''[[Vachellia collinsii]]'' are also hollow and offer shelter for ants, which indirectly protect the plant against herbivores.]]

Another category of plant defenses are those features that indirectly protect the plant by enhancing the probability of attracting the [[natural enemy |natural enemies]] of herbivores. Such an arrangement is known as [[Mutualism (biology) |mutualism]], in this case of the "[[the enemy of my enemy is my friend |enemy of my enemy]]" variety. One such feature are [[semiochemical]]s, given off by plants. Semiochemicals are a group of [[volatile organic compounds]] involved in interactions between organisms. One group of semiochemicals are [[Heterotelergones |allelochemicals]]; consisting of [[allomone]]s, which play a defensive role in [[interspecies communication]], and [[kairomone]]s, which are used by members of higher [[trophic level]]s to locate food sources. When a plant is attacked it releases allelochemics containing an abnormal ratio of these herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs).&lt;ref name=Dicke&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Dicke |first1=Marcel |author2=Joop J.A. van Loon |date=December 2000 |title=Multitrophic effects of herbivore-induced plant volatiles in an evolutionary context |journal=Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata |volume97=|issue=3 |pages=237–249 |doi=10.1046/j.1570-7458.2000.00736.x |volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Allmann | first1=S. | last2=Baldwin | first2=I.

The subsequent reduction in the number of herbivores confers a [[Fitness (biology) |fitness]] benefit to the plant and demonstrates the indirect defensive capabilities of semiochemicals.&lt;ref name=Schuman2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schuman |first1=Meredith C. |last2=Barthel |first2=Kathleen |last3=Baldwin |first3=Ian T. |date=October 2012 |title=Herbivory-induced volatiles function as defenses increasing fitness of the native plant Nicotiana attenuata in nature |journal=eLife Sciences |volume=1 |doi=10.7554/eLife.00007 |url=http://elife.elifesciences.org/content/elife/1/e00007.full.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116132945/http://elife.elifesciences.org/content/elife/1/e00007.full.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-16 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Induced volatiles also have drawbacks, however; some studies have suggested that these volatiles attract herbivores.&lt;ref name=Dicke/&gt;

Plants sometimes provide housing and food items for natural enemies of herbivores, known as "biotic" defense mechanisms, as a means to maintain their presence. For example, trees from the genus ''[[Macaranga]]'' have adapted their thin stem walls to create ideal housing for an ant species (genus ''[[Crematogaster]]''), which, in turn, protects the plant from herbivores.&lt;ref name=Heil&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Heil |first1=Martin |author2=Brigitte Fiala, K.

Similarly, several ''[[Acacia]]'' tree species have developed stipular spines (direct defenses) that are swollen at the base, forming a hollow structure that provides housing for protective ants. These ''Acacia'' trees also produce [[nectar]] in [[extrafloral nectaries]] on their leaves as food for the ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Truman P. |author2=Cynthia H.

[[Plant use of endophytic fungi in defense]] is common. Most plants have [[endophyte]]s, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and [[pathogen]]ic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing [[fungi]] which are common in grasses such as [[tall fescue]] (''Festuca arundinacea'').&lt;ref name="Raven 2005"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Raven |first1=Peter H. |author2=Ray F.

===Leaf shedding and color===

There have been suggestions that [[abscission |leaf shedding]] may be a response that provides protection against diseases and certain kinds of pests such as [[leaf miner]]s and [[gall]] forming insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Alan G. |author2=Thomas G.

==Costs and benefits==
Defensive structures and chemicals are costly as they require resources that could otherwise be used by plants to maximize growth and reproduction. Many models have been proposed to explore how and why some plants make this investment in defenses against herbivores.

===Optimal defense hypothesis===
The optimal defense hypothesis attempts to explain how the kinds of defenses a particular plant might use reflect the threats each individual plant faces.&lt;ref name=Stamp&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stamp |first=Nancy |title=Out of the quagmire of plant defense hypotheses |journal=Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=23–55 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12661508 |doi=10.1086/367580}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model considers three main factors, namely: risk of attack, value of the plant part, and the cost of defense.&lt;ref name=Rhoades&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Rhoades |first1=D. F. |author2=R. G. Cates. | editor=V. C. Runeckles |editor2=E. E.

The first factor determining optimal defense is risk: how likely is it that a plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related to the ''plant apparency hypothesis'', which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores.&lt;ref name=Feeny&gt;{{Cite book |last=Feeny |first=P. |editor=James W. Wallace |editor2=Richard L. Mansell |title=Biochemical interaction between plants and insects: proceedings of the fifteenth annual meeting of the Phytochemical Society of North America |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |year=1976 |pages=1–40 |chapter=Plant apparency and chemical defense. |isbn=0-306-34710-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses.&lt;ref name=Feeny/&gt; Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early [[Ecological succession |successional]] stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest in small amounts of qualitative toxins that are effective against all but the most specialized herbivores.&lt;ref name=Feeny/&gt;

The second factor is the value of protection: would the plant be less able to survive and reproduce after removal of part of its structure by a herbivore? Not all plant parts are of equal evolutionary value, thus valuable parts contain more defenses. A plant’s stage of development at the time of feeding also affects the resulting change in fitness. Experimentally, the fitness value of a plant structure is determined by removing that part of the plant and observing the effect.&lt;ref name=McKey1&gt;{{Cite book |first=McKey |last=D. |editor=Gerald A.

For example, the seeds of many edible fruits and nuts contain cyanogenic glycosides such as [[amygdalin]]. This results from the need to balance the effort needed to make the fruit attractive to animal dispersers while ensuring that the seeds are not destroyed by the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Swain |first1=Elisabeth |author2=Chun Ping Li |author3=Jonathan E.

The final consideration is cost: how much will a particular defensive strategy cost a plant in energy and materials? This is particularly important, as energy spent on defense cannot be used for other functions, such as reproduction and growth. The optimal defense hypothesis predicts that plants will allocate more energy towards defense when the benefits of protection outweigh the costs, specifically in situations where there is high herbivore pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Pennings |first1=Steven C. |author2=Erin L.

===Carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis===
The carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis, also known as the ''environmental constraint hypothesis'' or ''Carbon Nutrient Balance Model'' (CNBM), states that the various types of plant defenses are responses to variations in the levels of [[nutrient]]s in the environment.&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bryant |first1=John P. |author2=Stuart Chapin, III |author3=David R. Klein |date=May 1983 |title=Carbon/nutrient balance of boreal plants in relation to vertebrate herbivory |journal=Oikos |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=357–368 |doi=10.2307/3544308 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |jstor=3544308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Tuomi |first1=J. |editor=William J.

Niemela |author3=F. S. Chapin, III |author4=J. P. Bryant |author5=S. Siren.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis predicts the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in plants determines which secondary metabolites will be synthesized. For example, plants growing in [[nitrogen]]-poor [[soil]]s will use [[carbon]]-based defenses (mostly digestibility reducers), while those growing in low-carbon environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based defenses. If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of [[fertilizer]]s, these carbon-based defenses will decrease.

===Growth rate hypothesis===
The growth rate hypothesis, also known as the ''resource availability hypothesis'', states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the [[limiting factor]] in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases.&lt;ref name=Coley&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Colley |first1=Phyllis D. |author2=John P.

A recent test of this model involved a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between [[clay]] [[soil]]s (nutrient rich) and white [[sand]] (nutrient poor) to determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but in the presence of herbivores the seedlings originating from white sand performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Fine |first1=Paul V. A. |author2=Italo Mesones |author3=Phyllis D.

In situations where resources (e.g. water and nutrients) limit photosynthesis, carbon supply is predicted to limit both growth and defense. As resource availability increases, the requirements needed to support photosynthesis are met, allowing for accumulation of carbohydrate in tissues. As resources are not sufficient to meet the large demands of growth, these carbon compounds can instead be partitioned into the synthesis of carbon based secondary metabolites (phenolics, tannins, etc.). In environments where the resource demands for growth are met, carbon is allocated to rapidly dividing meristems (high sink strength) at the expense of secondary metabolism. Thus rapidly growing plants are predicted to contain lower levels of secondary metabolites and vice versa. In addition, the tradeoff predicted by the GDBH may change over time, as evidenced by a recent study on [[Salix]] spp. Much support for this hypothesis is present in the literature, and some scientists consider the GDBH the most mature of the plant defense hypotheses.

==Importance to humans ==

===Agriculture ===
The variation of plant susceptibility to pests was probably known even in the early stages of agriculture in humans. In historic times, the observation of such variations in susceptibility have provided solutions for major [[socio-economic]] problems. The [[hemiptera]]n pest insect [[phylloxera]] was introduced from North America to France in 1860 and in 25 years it destroyed nearly a third (100,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of French [[vineyard]]s. [[Charles Valentine Riley]] noted that the American species ''[[Vitis labrusca]]'' was resistant to Phylloxera. Riley, with J. E. Planchon, helped save the [[French wine]] industry by suggesting the [[grafting]] of the susceptible but high quality grapes onto ''Vitis labrusca'' root stocks.&lt;ref name=Rutgers&gt;{{Cite web |first=Sridhar |last=Polavarapu |url=http://aesop.rutgers.edu/~hamilton/lecture12.htm |title=Plant Resistance to insects |accessdate=2007-05-16 |year=2001 |work=Agricultural Entomology &amp; Pest Management |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713203855/http://aesop.rutgers.edu/~hamilton/lecture12.htm |archivedate=2007-07-13 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The formal study of plant resistance to herbivory was first covered extensively in 1951 by Reginald (R.H.) Painter, who is widely regarded as the founder of this area of research, in his book ''Plant Resistance to Insects''.&lt;ref name=Painter&gt;{{Cite book | last=Painter | first=Reginald Henry | year=1951 | title=Insect Resistance in Crop Plants | publisher=University of Kansas Press | location=Lawrence |oclc=443998}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this work pioneered further research in the US, the work of Chesnokov was the basis of further research in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Chesnokov |first=Pavel G. |title=Methods of Investigating Plant Resistance to Pests |year=1953 |publisher=Israel Program for Scientific Translations |location=Jerusalem |oclc=3576157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh growth of grass is sometimes high in [[prussic acid]] content and can cause poisoning of grazing livestock. The production of [[cyanogenic]] chemicals in grasses is primarily a defense against herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gleadow |first1=Roslyn M. |author2=Ian E.

The human innovation of cooking may have been particularly helpful in overcoming many of the defensive chemicals of plants. Many [[enzyme inhibitor]]s in [[cereal grain]]s and [[Pulse (legume)|pulse]]s, such as [[trypsin]] inhibitors prevalent in pulse crops, are denatured by cooking, making them digestible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Grant |first1=G |author2=Linda J.

It has been known since the late 17th century that plants contain [[wiktionary:noxious |noxious]] chemicals which are avoided by insects. These chemicals have been used by man as early insecticides; in 1690 nicotine was extracted from tobacco and used as a contact insecticide. In 1773, insect infested plants were treated with nicotine [[fumigation]] by heating tobacco and blowing the smoke over the plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=George W. |title=The Pesticide Book |publisher=MeisterPro |location=Willoughby |year=2004 |isbn=1-892829-11-8 |quote=firat Ware}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flowers of ''[[Chrysanthemum]]'' species contain [[pyrethrin]] which is a potent insecticide. In later years, the applications of plant resistance became an important area of research in [[agriculture]] and [[plant breeding]], particularly because they can serve as a safe and low-cost alternative to the use of [[pesticide]]s.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{Cite book |first=C. |last=Michael Smith |title=Plant Resistance to Arthropods: Molecular and Conventional Approaches |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2005 |isbn=1-4020-3701-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The important role of secondary plant substances in plant defense was described in the late 1950s by [[Vincent Dethier]] and G.S.

Natural materials found in the environment also induce plant resistance as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Linden, J., Stoner, R., Knutson, K. Gardner-Hughes, C.

The selective breeding of crop plants often involves selection against the plant's intrinsic resistance strategies. This makes crop plant varieties particularly susceptible to pests unlike their wild relatives. In breeding for host-plant resistance, it is often the wild relatives that provide the source of resistance [[gene]]s. These genes are incorporated using conventional approaches to plant breeding, but have also been augmented by [[Recombinant DNA |recombinant]] techniques, which allow introduction of genes from completely unrelated organisms. The most famous [[transgenic]] approach is the introduction of genes from the bacterial species, ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', into plants. The bacterium produces proteins that, when ingested, kill [[lepidoptera]]n [[caterpillar]]s. The gene encoding for these highly toxic proteins, when introduced into the host plant genome, confers resistance against caterpillars, when the same toxic proteins are produced within the plant. This approach is controversial, however, due to the possibility of [[ecological]] and [[toxicological]] side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=van Emden |first=H.F. |date=November 1999 |title=Transgenic Host Plant Resistance to Insects—Some Reservations |journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=788–797 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/esa/aesa/1999/00000092/00000006/art00002 | accessdate=2007-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceutical ===
[[Image:Mandragora Tacuinum Sanitatis.jpg |thumb |upright |Illustration from the 15th-century manuscript ''[[Tacuinum Sanitatis]]'' detailing the beneficial and harmful properties of [[Mandragora (genus) |Mandrake]]s]]

Many currently available [[pharmaceutical]]s are derived from the secondary metabolites plants use to protect themselves from herbivores, including [[opium]], [[aspirin]], [[cocaine]], and [[atropine]].&lt;ref name="pmid11395950"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ghosh |first=B. |title=Polyamines and plant alkaloids |journal=Indian Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=38 |issue=11 |pages=1086–91 |year=2000 |pmid=11395950}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals have evolved to affect the biochemistry of insects in very specific ways. However, many of these biochemical pathways are conserved in vertebrates, including humans, and the chemicals act on human biochemistry in ways similar to that of insects. It has therefore been suggested that the study of plant-insect interactions may help in [[bioprospecting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eisner |first=Thomas |date=March 1990 |title=Prospecting for nature's chemical riches |journal=Chemoecology |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=38–40 |doi=10.1007/BF01240585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that humans began using plant alkaloids in medical preparations as early as 3000 [[Before Christ |B.C.]]&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt; Although the active components of most medicinal plants have been isolated only recently (beginning in the early 19th century) these substances have been used as drugs throughout the human history in potions, medicines, teas and as [[poison]]s. For example, to combat herbivory by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, [[Cinchona]] trees produce a variety of alkaloids, the most familiar of which is [[quinine]]. Quinine is extremely bitter, making the bark of the tree quite unpalatable, it is also an anti-[[fever]] agent, known as [[Jesuit's bark]], and is especially useful in treating [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/The%20Quinine%20Alkaloids.pdf |title=The Quinine Alkaloids |accessdate=2007-05-23 |author=Albert T.

Throughout history mandrakes (''[[Mandragora officinarum]]'') have been highly sought after for their reputed [[aphrodisiac]] properties. However, the roots of the mandrake plant also contain large quantities of the alkaloid [[Hyoscine hydrobromide |scopolamine]], which, at high doses, acts as a [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]], and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. Scopolamine was later found to be medicinally used for pain management prior to and during [[childbirth |labor]]; in smaller doses it is used to prevent [[motion sickness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/tropane%20alkaloids.pdf |title=The Tropane Alkaloids |accessdate=2007-05-23 |author=Albert T.

'''Recirculating aquaculture systems''' ('''RAS''') are used in home aquaria and for [[fish]] production where [[water]] exchange is limited and the use of [[biofiltration]] is required to reduce [[ammonia]] toxicity.&lt;ref name="Timmons"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Timmons and James B. Ebeling|title=Recirculating Aquaculture|edition= 3rd |publisher=Ithaca Publishing Company Publishers|year=2013|page=3 |isbn=978-0971264656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of [[filtration]] and environmental control are often also necessary to maintain clean water and provide a suitable [[habitat]] for fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas B. Lawson|title=Fundamentals of Aquaculture Engineering|edition= |publisher=Springer US|year=1995|page=192 |isbn=978-1-4615-7049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main benefit of RAS is the ability to reduce the need for fresh, clean water while still maintaining a healthy environment for fish. To be operated economically commercial RAS must have high fish stocking densities,  and many researchers are currently conducting studies to determine if RAS is a viable form of intensive [[aquaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Jenner | first1 = Andrew | title = Recirculating aquaculture systems: The future of fish farming?| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2010/0224/Recirculating-aquaculture-systems-The-future-of-fish-farming| website = Christian Science Monitor| date = February 24, 2010 | accessdate =August 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RAS water treatment processes==
[[File:Outdoor biofilter and degasser on a largemouth bass farm.jpg|thumb|A biofilter and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; degasser on an outdoor recirculating aquaculture system used to grow largemouth bass.]]
[[File:Recirculating aquaculture system flow chart.png|thumb| Water treatment processes needed in a recirculating aquaculture system.]]
A series of treatment processes is utilized to maintain water quality in intensive fish farming operations. These steps are often done in order or sometimes in tandem. After leaving the vessel holding fish the water is first treated for solids before entering a biofilter to convert ammonia, next degassing and oxygenation occur, often followed by heating/cooling and sterilization. Each of these processes can be completed by using a variety of different methods and equipment, but regardless all must take place to ensure a healthy environment that maximizes fish growth and health.

===Biofiltration===
{{Main|Biofiltration}}

All RAS relies on [[biofiltration]] to convert [[ammonia ]](NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) excreted by the [[fish]] into [[nitrate]].&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Hall |first=Antar |date=December 1, 1999 |title=A Comparative Analysis of Three Biofilter Types Treating Wastewater Produced in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems |type= Master of Science |chapter= |publisher= |docket= |oclc= |url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-0104100-133802/unrestricted/AntarThesisFinalForm3.pdf |access-date= September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia is a waste product of fish [[metabolism]] and high concentrations (&gt;.02&amp;nbsp;mg/L) are toxic to most finfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Stickney|title=Principles of Aquaculture|edition= 2nd |publisher= Wiley |year=1994|page=91 |isbn=0-471-57856-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrifying bacteria are [[chemoautotrophs]] that convert ammonia into nitrite then nitrate. A [[biofilter]] provides a substrate for the bacterial community, which results in thick [[biofilm]] growing within the filter.&lt;ref name= "Hall"/&gt; Water is pumped through the filter, and ammonia is utilized by the bacteria for energy. Nitrate is less toxic than ammonia (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;mg/L), and can be removed by a denitrifying biofilter or by water replacement. Stable environmental conditions and regular maintenance are required to ensure the biofilter is operating efficiently.

===Solids removal===

In addition to treating the liquid waste excreted by fish the solid waste must also be treated, this is done by concentrating and flushing the solids out of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Summerfelt | first1 = Robert | last2 = Penne | first2 = Chris| title =Solids removal in a recirculating aquaculture system where the majority of the flow bypasses the microscreen filter | journal = Aquacultural Engineering | volume = 33 | pages = 214–224 | date = September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing solids reduces bacteria growth, oxygen demand, and the proliferation of [[disease]]. The simplest method for removing solids is the creation of settling basin where the relative velocity of the water is slow and particles can settle at the bottom of the tank where they are either flushed out or vacuumed out manually using a siphon. However, this method is not viable for RAS operations where a small footprint is desired. Typical RAS solids removal involves a sand filter or particle filter where solids become lodged and can be periodically backflushed out of the filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Chen | first1 = Shulin | last2 = Malone | first2 = Ronald | title =Suspended solids control in recirculating aquaculture systems | journal = Proceedings from Aquaculture Symposium in Cornell University, Ithaca, NY | volume =  | pages = 170–186 | date = 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common method is the use of a mechanical drum filter where water is run over a rotating drum screen that is periodically cleaned by pressurized spray nozzles, and the resulting slurry is treated or sent down the drain. In order to remove extremely fine particles or colloidal solids a [[Protein_skimmer|protein fractionator]] may be used with or without the addition of ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Oxygenation===

Reoxygenating the system water is a crucial part to obtaining high production densities. Fish require oxygen to metabolize food and grow, as do bacteria communities in the biofilter. Dissolved oxygen levels can be increased through two methods [[aeration]] and [[oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenation]]. In aeration air is pumped through an air stone or similar device that creates small bubbles in the water column, this results in a high surface area where oxygen can dissolve into the water. In general due to slow gas dissolution rates and the high air pressure needed to create small bubbles this method is considered inefficient and the water is instead oxygenated by pumping in pure oxygen.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite book|author=Odd-Ivar Lekang|title=Aquaculture Engineering|edition= 2nd |publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons|year=2013|page=165 |isbn=978-0-470-67085-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various methods are used to ensure that during oxygenation all of the oxygen dissolves into the water column. Careful calculation and consideration must be given to the oxygen demand of a given system, and that demand must be met with either oxygenation or aeration equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Kepenyes | first1 = J.| title = Chapter 15 Recirculatig Systems and Re-use of Water in Aquaculture| url =http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5744E/x5744e0g.htm| website =FAO| date = | accessdate =October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===pH control===

In all RAS [[pH]] must be carefully monitored and controlled. The first step of nitrification in the biofilter consumes [[alkalinity]] and lowers the pH of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1 =Losordo| first1 =T.| last2 =Massar| first2 =M.| last3 =Rakocy| first3 =J| title =Recirculating Aquaculture Tank Production Systems: an overview of critical conditions| url =http://www.extension.org/mediawiki/files/f/f5/Overview_of_RAS.pdf| website =| date =September 1998| accessdate =August 25, 2015| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20151017093654/http://www.extension.org/mediawiki/files/f/f5/Overview_of_RAS.pdf| archivedate =October 17, 2015| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping the pH in a suitable range (5.0-9.0 for freshwater systems) is crucial to maintain the health of both the fish and biofilter. pH is typically controlled by the addition of alkalinity in the form of lime (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH). A low pH will lead to high levels of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which can prove toxic to fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Summerfelt | first1 = Steven | title = Engineering of water reuse systems | url = http://www.ncrac.org/NR/rdonlyres/E4216F9B-2961-4145-A136-850BD8E8A9D9/0/Chapter11.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110102042354/http://www.ncrac.org/NR/rdonlyres/E4216F9B-2961-4145-A136-850BD8E8A9D9/0/Chapter11.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2011-01-02 | website =  | date = 1996 | accessdate = September 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pH can also be controlled by [[degassing]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a packed column or with an aerator, this is necessary in intensive systems especially where oxygenation instead of aeration is used in tanks to maintain O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Malone | first1 = Ron| title = Recirculating Aquaculture Tank Production Systems: A Review of Current Design Practices| url =http://appliedecology.cals.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/453.pdf| website =North Carolina State University| date = October 2013 |page=5 | accessdate =October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature control===

All fish species have a preferred [[temperature]] above and below which that fish will experience negative health effects and eventually death. Warm water species such as [[Tilapia]] and [[Barramundi]] prefer 24&amp;nbsp;°C water or warmer, where as cold water species such as [[trout]] and [[salmon]] prefer water temperature below 16&amp;nbsp;°C. Temperature also plays an important role in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, with higher water temperatures having lower values for DO saturation. Temperature is controlled through the use of submerged heaters, [[heat pumps]], [[chillers]], and [[heat exchangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Odd-Ivar Lekang|title=Aquaculture Engineering|edition= 2nd |publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons|year=2013|page=136 |isbn=978-0-470-67085-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four may be used to keep a system operating at the optimal temperature for maximizing fish production.

===Biosecurity===

[[Disease]] outbreaks occur more readily when dealing with the high fish stocking densities typically employed in intensive RAS. Outbreaks can be reduced by operating multiple independent systems with the same building and isolating water to water contact between systems by cleaning equipment and personnel that move between systems.&lt;ref name= "Yanong"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Yanong | first1 = R. | title = Fish Health Management Considerations in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems - Part 1: Introduction and General Principles| url=http://www.extension.org/mediawiki/files/6/69/Fish_Health_Management_Considerations_in_RAS,_Introduction_and_General_Principles.pdf| website =| date = | accessdate =August 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the use of a [[Ultra Violet]] (UV) or [[ozone]] water treatment system reduces the number of free floating virus and bacteria in the system water. These treatment systems reduce the disease loading that occurs on stressed fish and thus reduce the chance of an outbreak.

==Special types of RAS==

===Aquaponics===
{{Main|Aquaponics}}

Combining plants and fish in a RAS is referred to as aquaponics. In this type of system ammonia produced by the fish is not only converted to nitrate but is also removed by the plants from the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Diver | first1 = S. | title = Aquaponics Integration of Hydroponics and Aquaculture | url = http://www.extension.org/mediawiki/files/2/28/Hydroponics_with_Aquaculture.pdf | website =  | date = 2006 | accessdate = August 25, 2015 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120417140632/http://www.extension.org/mediawiki/files/2/28/Hydroponics_with_Aquaculture.pdf | archivedate = April 17, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an aquaponics system fish effectively fertilize the plants, this creates a closed looped system where very little waste is generated and inputs are minimized. [[Aquaponics]] provides the advantage of being able to harvest and sell multiple crops.

===Aquariums===
{{Main|Aquariums}}

Home aquaria and inland commercial aquariums are a form of RAS where the water quality is very carefully controlled and the stocking density of fish is relatively low. In these systems the goal is to display the fish rather than producing food. However, biofilters and other forms of water treatment are still used to reduce the need to exchange water and to maintain water clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David  E. Boruchowitz |title=The Simple Guide to Freshwater Aquariums|edition= |publisher=T.F.H |year=2001|page=31 |isbn=9780793821013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like in traditional RAS water must be removed periodically to prevent nitrate and other toxic chemicals from building up in the system. Coastal aquariums often have high rates of water exchange and are typically not operated as a RAS due to their proximity to a large body of clean water.

In [[astronomy]], a '''redshift survey''' is a [[astronomical surveys|survey]] of a section of the sky to measure the [[redshift]] of [[astronomical object]]s: usually galaxies, but sometimes other objects such as galaxy clusters or quasars.  
Using [[Hubble's law]], the redshift can be used to estimate the distance of an object from [[Earth]].  By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky.  These observations are used to measure detailed statistical properties of the [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large-scale structure]] of the universe. In conjunction with observations of early structure in the [[cosmic microwave background]], these results can place strong constraints on cosmological parameters such as the average matter density&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peacock|first1=John A.|last2=Cole|first2=Shaun|last3=Norberg|first3=Peder|last4=Baugh|first4=Carlton M.|last5=Bland-Hawthorn|first5=Joss|last6=Bridges|first6=Terry|last7=Cannon|first7=Russell D.|last8=Colless|first8=Matthew|last9=Collins|first9=Chris|last10=Couch|first10=Warrick|last11=Dalton|first11=Gavin|last12=Deeley|first12=Kathryn

Generally the construction of a redshift survey involves two phases: first the selected area of the sky is imaged with a wide-field telescope, then galaxies brighter than a defined limit are selected from the resulting images as non-pointlike objects; optionally, colour selection may also be used to assist discrimination between stars and galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SkyServer - Algorithms|url=http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr1/en/help/docs/algorithm.asp?key=target|website=sdss.org|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the selected galaxies are observed by [[spectroscopy]], most commonly at visible wavelengths, to measure the wavelengths of prominent [[spectral line]]s; comparing observed and laboratory wavelengths then gives the [[redshift]] for each galaxy.

The [[Great Wall (astronomy)|Great Wall]], a vast conglomeration of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.

The first systematic redshift survey was the [[CfA Redshift Survey]] of around 2,200 galaxies, started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982. This was later extended to the CfA2 redshift survey of 15,000 galaxies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Falco|first1=Emilio E.|last2=Kurtz|first2=Michael J.|last3=Geller|first3=Margaret J.|last4=Huchra|first4=John P.|last5=Peters|first5=James|last6=Berlind|first6=Perry|last7=Mink|first7=Douglas J.|last8=Tokarz|first8=Susan P.|last9=Elwell|first9=Barbara|title=The Updated Zwicky Catalog (UZC)|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|volume=111|issue=758|pages=438–452|doi=10.1086/316343|year=1999|arxiv = astro-ph/9904265 |bibcode = 1999PASP..111..438F }}&lt;/ref&gt; completed in the early 1990s.

These early redshift surveys were limited in size by taking a spectrum for one galaxy at a time; from the 1990s, the development of fibre-optic spectrographs and multi-slit spectrographs enabled spectra for several hundred galaxies to be observed simultaneously, and much larger redshift surveys became feasible. Notable examples are the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] (221,000 redshifts, completed 2002); the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (approximately 1 million redshifts by 2007) and the [[Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey]].  At high redshift the largest current surveys are the [[DEEP2 Redshift Survey]] and the [[VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS)]]; these have around 50,000 redshifts each, and are mainly focused on galaxy evolution. 

[[ZFOURGE]] or the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey is a large and deep medium-band imaging survey which aims to establish an observational benchmark of [[galaxy]] properties at [[redshift]] z &gt; 1. The survey is using [[near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infrared]] FOURSTAR instrument on the [[Magellan Telescopes]], surveying in all three HST legacy fields: COSMOS, CDFS, and UDS.&lt;ref&gt;http://zfourge.tamu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the demands on observing time required to obtain spectroscopic redshifts (i.e., redshifts determined directly from [[Spectral line|spectral features]] measured at high precision), a common alternative is to use [[photometric redshift]]s based on model fits to the brightnesses and colors of objects. Such "photo-z's" can be used in large surveys to estimate the spatial distribution of galaxies and quasars, provided the [[Galaxy#Types and morphology|galaxy types]] and [[Galaxy color-magnitude diagram|colors]] are well understood in a particular redshift range. At present, the errors on photometric redshift measurements are significantly higher than those of [[Spectroscopic astronomy|spectroscopic]] redshifts, but future surveys (for example, the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope|LSST]]) aim to significantly refine the technique.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4690">'''Ritualization ''' is a behavior that occurs typically in a member of a given [[species]] in a highly [[stereotype]]d fashion and independent of any direct [[physiological]] significance. It is found, in differing forms, both in non-human animals and in humans.

==In non-human animals ==

[[Konrad Lorenz]], working with [[Greylag goose|greylag geese]] and other animals such as [[water shrew]]s, showed that ritualization was an important process in their development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Konrad Lorenz|Lorenz, Konrad]],''[[On Aggression]]'' 1963&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that the geese obsessively displayed a reflexive motor pattern of egg retrieval when stimulated by the sight of an egg outside their nest. Similarly, in the shrews, Lorenz showed that once they had become used to jumping over a stone in their path, they went on jumping at that place after the stone was taken away. This sort of behaviour is analogous to [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] in humans.&lt;ref name="Hoffman 2016 pp. 1–33"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hoffman | first=Kurt Leroy | title=Modeling Neuropsychiatric Disorders in Laboratory Animals | chapter=Animal models for studying obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | publisher=Elsevier | year=2016 | isbn=978-0-08-100099-1 | doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-100099-1.00001-7 | pages=161–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Oskar Heinroth]] in 1910 and Lorenz from 1935 onwards studied the triumph ceremony in geese; Lorenz described it as becoming a fixed ritual.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pp. 477–477"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lorenz | first=K. Z. | title=The Triumph Ceremony of the Greylag Goose, Anser anser L | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | publisher=The Royal Society | volume=251 | issue=772 | date=1966-12-29 | issn=0962-8436 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1966.0038 | pages=477–477}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves a rolling behaviour (of the head and neck) and cackling with the head stretched forward, and occurs only among geese that know each other, meaning within a family or between mates. The triumph ceremony appears in varied situations, such as when mates meet after having been separated, when disturbed, or after an attack. The behaviour is now known also in other species, such as [[Canada goose]].&lt;ref name="Radesäter1974"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Radesäter |first1=Tommy |title=Form and Sequential Associations between the Triumph Ceremony and Other BehaviourPatterns in the Canada Goose Branta canadensis L. |journal=Ornis Scandinavica |date=1974 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=87-101 |jstor=3676053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In humans==
{{further|Structural ritualization theory}}

Ritualization is associated with the work of [[Catherine Bell (religious studies scholar)|Catherine Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Catherine. ''Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice..'' Oxford University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Bell, drawing on the [[Practice Theory]] of [[Pierre Bourdieu]], has taken a less [[structural-functionalism|functional]] view of [[ritual]] with her elaboration of ritualization. 

More recently scholars interested in the [[cognitive science of religion]] such as [[Pascal Boyer]], [[Pierre Liénard]], and William W. McCorkle, Jr. have been involved in experimental, ethnographic, and archival research on how ritualized actions might inform the study of ritualization and ritual forms of action. Boyer, Liénard, and McCorkle argue that ritualized compulsions are in relation to an evolved cognitive architecture where social, cultural, and environmental selection pressures stimulate "hazard-precaution" systems such as predation, contagion, and disgust in human minds.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. ''The Naturalness of Religious Ideas.'' University of California Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. ''[[Religion Explained|Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought.]]'' Basic Books, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. "Religious Thought and Behavior as By-Products of Brain Functions," Trends in Cognitive Sciences, vol 7, pp 119-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P and Liénard, P. "Why ritualized behavior? Precaution Systems and action parsing in developmental, pathological and cultural rituals .” Behavioral and Brain Sciences. 29: 595-650.&lt;/ref&gt; McCorkle argued that these ritualized compulsions (especially in regard to dead bodies vis-à-vis, mortuary behavior) were turned into ritual scripts by professional guilds only several thousand years ago with advancement in technology such as the domestication of plants and animals, literacy, and writing.&lt;ref&gt;McCorkle Jr., William W. "Ritualizing the Disposal of the Deceased: From Corpse to Concept." Peter Lang, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willowbank''' is an independent educational institution located on the Willowbank [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] and in the village centre of [[Queenston, Ontario]], along the Canada-United States border. It operates a School of Restoration Arts which offers a three-year post-secondary diploma in conservation skills and theory, and a Centre for Cultural Landscape, a forum for [[cultural landscape]] theory and practice in Canada and the world. Willowbank was created from the rescue of a 19th-century estate which today forms the centre of its campus, and it is one of a handful of Canadian organisations of which His Royal Highness [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] is [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage|Royal Patron]].

==School of Restoration Arts==

Founded in 2006, the School of Restoration Arts offers a three-year, post-secondary Diploma in Heritage Conservation which combines academic and apprenticeship learning, taught by over 50 faculty associates who are leading practitioners in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.willowbank.ca/asset/1970/Willowbank_Release.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031135/http://www.willowbank.ca/asset/1970/Willowbank_Release.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} Press Release, The Prince of Wales becomes Royal Patron of Willowbank, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The School accepts a maximum of 18 students each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/school-of-restoration-arts/program/admissions/index/] Willowbank Admissions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centre for Cultural Landscape==

The Willowbank Centre for Cultural Landscape is an initiative that builds on its exploration of [[cultural landscape]] theory and practice to define a particularly Canadian perspective in this area of current discussion and debate. It facilitates a program of lecture series, workshops and publications to promote a connection between cultural landscape and cultural practice, and to advocate for its ecological view of cultural and natural heritage conservation. The Centre also coordinates Willowbank’s seat in global deliberations about conservation, whose participants include a cross-section of board, staff and students. In 2013, Willowbank signed an agreement with the [[UNESCO]]-affiliated World Heritage Institute in Shanghai, China, with a focus on the UNESCO Recommendation for Historic Urban Landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/about-us/new/new/ Willowbank agreement with UNESCO-affiliated World Heritage Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was created in 2012 through a multi-year grant from the [[Ontario Trillium Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otf.ca/school-restoration-arts-willowbank?redirected=1] Ontario Trillium Foundation, 2012-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

Willowbank's campus is composed of two main parts, a 19th-century estate, and a former village elementary school with its surrounding lands. The former, described in further detail below, traces its history to 8,000 years of human habitation. The landscape of the estate includes a ravine and a hill upon which sits a 19th-century stone mansion. Newly built and re-built outbuildings have been constructed to house student workshops, including a barn and a forge and stone studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/national-historic-site/index/#menu-2] Willowbank National Historic Site&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjacent to the estate is the former Laura Secord School in the centre of the village, bought in 2012 by Willowbank after it was abandoned. The transfer is designed to house school activities while also returning the building and lands to community use and creating affordable housing. Its original wing was constructed in 1914, with substantial additions made in the 1950s. The original, two-classroom building housed students upstairs while the lower level was a centre of village life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2012/03/22/willowbank-buys-old-laura-secord-school] Willowbank buys old Laura Secord School, Niagara Falls Review, March 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field School==
Willowbank runs a three-week field school every summer in partnership with the Canova Association in the [[Ossola|Ossola Valley]] in Northern Italy. It is a microcosm of the diploma program, with an introduction to cultural landscape theory and practice, an experience of documentation and design, and then a major hands-on component. The work involves creative restoration and adaptive reuse of abandoned medieval stone structures, carried out under the direction of Italian masons and craftsmen. It coincides with the International Architect Encounter in the same place, an annual, intimate conference of world leaders in conservation and ecological design, with whom the field school’s participants are able to engage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/centre-for-cultural-landscape/short-courses/italy/index/] Willowbank Italy Field School&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Historic Site==

Willowbank's campus includes a designated [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] in the century estate to which it traces its name, also designated under Part IV of the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]'', and further protected by a heritage easement granted to The [[Ontario Heritage Trust]]. It is named after [[willow]] trees that were once located on its grounds, is an example of the rural estates of the wealthy settlers of early 19th century [[Upper Canada]]. Its mansion, which is the centre of campus, was built between 1832 and 1834 for Alexander Hamilton, third son of Robert Hamilton, one of the founders  of Upper Canada. Constructed in the [[Greek Revival]] style of [[architecture]] then at its height in North America for such grand houses, Willowbank's is an example of such buildings on the continent. Designed by architect, John Latshaw, and built of local [[Whirlpool]] [[sandstone]], the building is characterised by the rare features of eight hand-carved columns running its full two-story height, and by a front doorway of Greek design. The 13-acre estate today forms the centre of the Willowbank campus.

'''Social research''' is a [[research]] conducted by [[social scientist]]s following a systematic plan. Social research methodologies can be classified as [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]].&lt;ref&gt;Shackman, Gene. What is Program Evaluation, A Beginner's Guide. Module 3. Methods. The Global Social Change Research Project. 2009. Available at http://www.ideas-int.org. See Resources.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Quantitative method|Quantitative designs]] approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create [[Validity (statistics)|valid]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliable]] general claims. Related to quantity.
* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative designs]] emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual subjective accuracy over generality. Related to quality.

While methods may be classified as quantitative or qualitative, most methods contain elements of both. For example, qualitative data analysis often involves a fairly structured approach to coding the raw data into systematic information, and quantifying intercoder reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elizabeth H. Bradley |author2=Leslie A. Curry |author3=Kelly J. Devers |title=Qualitative Data Analysis for Health Services Research: Developing Taxonomy, Themes, and Theory |journal=Health Serv Res |date=August 2007 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=1758–1772 |pmc=1955280 |pmid=17286625 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2006.00684.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there is often a more complex relationship between "qualitative" and "quantitative" approaches than would be suggested by drawing a simple distinction between them.

Social scientists employ a range of methods in order to analyse a vast breadth of social phenomena: from [[census]] survey data derived from millions of individuals, to the in-depth analysis of a single agent's social experiences; from monitoring what is happening on contemporary streets, to the investigation of ancient historical documents. Methods rooted in classical [[sociology]] and [[statistics]] have formed the basis for research in other disciplines, such as [[political science]], [[media studies]], [[program evaluation]] and [[market research]].

==Method==

Social scientists are divided into camps of support for particular research techniques. These disputes relate to the historical core of social theory ([[positivism]] and [[antipositivism]]; [[structure and agency]]). While very different in many aspects, both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between [[social theory|theory]] and [[data]].&lt;ref name="Methods"&gt;Haralambos &amp; Holborn. ''Sociology: Themes and perspectives'' (2004) 6th ed, Collins Educational. {{ISBN|978-0-00-715447-0}}. Chapter 14: Methods&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of method often depends largely on what the researcher intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individuals' [[social actions]] may choose ethnographic [[participant observation]] or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or ''[[triangulation (social science)|triangulate]]'', quantitative ''and'' qualitative methods as part of a multi-strategy design.

==Sampling==

Typically a population is very large, making a [[census]] or a complete [[enumeration]] of all the values in that population infeasible. A sample thus forms a manageable [[subset]] of a [[Statistical population|population]]. In positivist research, statistics derived from a sample are analysed in order to draw [[inference]]s regarding the population as a whole. The process of collecting information from a sample is referred to as ''[[sampling (statistics)|sampling]]''. Sampling methods may be either random ([[random sampling]], [[systematic sampling]], [[stratified sampling]], [[cluster sampling]]) or non-random/[[nonprobability sampling|nonprobability]] ([[convenience sampling]], [[purposive sampling]], [[snowball sampling]]).&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt; The most common reason for sampling is to obtain information about a population. Sampling is quicker and cheaper than a complete [[census]] of a population.

==Methodological assumptions==

Social research is based on [[logic]] and [[empirical]] [[Observation#The role of Observation in the Scientific Method|observation]]s. [[Charles C. Ragin]] writes in his ''Constructing Social Research'' book that "Social research involved the interaction between ideas and evidence. Ideas help social researchers make sense of evidence, and researchers use evidence to extend, revise and test ideas." Social research thus attempts to create or validate [[theory|theories]] through [[data collection]] and [[data analysis]], and its goal is exploration, description, [[explanation]], and [[prediction]]. It should never lead or be mistaken with [[philosophy]] or [[belief]]. Social research aims to find social patterns of regularity in social life and usually deals with [[social group]]s (aggregates of individuals), not individuals themselves (although science of [[psychology]] is an exception here). Research can also be divided into [[pure research]] and [[applied research]]. Pure research has no application on real life, whereas applied research attempts to influence the real world.

There are no laws in [[social science]] that parallel the [[Physical law|laws]] in [[natural science]]. A law in social science is a universal generalization about a [[Class (set theory)|class]] of [[fact]]s. A fact is an observed [[phenomenon]], and [[Observation#The role of Observation in the Scientific Method|observation]] means it has been seen, heard or otherwise experienced by researcher. A theory is a systematic explanation for the observations that relate to a particular aspect of social life. [[Concept]]s are the basic building blocks of theory and are abstract elements representing classes of phenomena. [[Axiom]]s or [[postulate]]s are basic assertions assumed to be true. [[Proposition]]s are conclusions drawn about the relationships among concepts, based on analysis of axioms. [[Hypothesis|Hypotheses]] are specified expectations about [[empirical]] [[reality]] derived from propositions. Social research involves [[Hypothesis testing|testing]] these hypotheses to see if they are true.

Social research involves creating a theory, [[operationalization]] ([[measurement]] of variables) and [[observation]] (actual collection of [[data]] to test hypothesized relationship). Social theories are written in the language of variables, in other words, theories describe logical relationships between variables. Variables are logical sets of attributes, with people being the "carriers" of those variables (for example, [[gender]] can be a variable with two attributes: [[male]] and [[female]]). Variables are also divided into [[independent variable]]s (data) that influences the [[dependent variable]]s (which scientists are trying to explain). For example, in a study of how different dosages of a drug are related to the severity of symptoms of a disease, a measure of the severity of the symptoms of the disease is a dependent variable and the administration of the drug in specified doses is the independent variable. Researchers will compare the different values of the dependent variable (severity of the symptoms) and attempt to draw conclusions.

==Guidelines for "good research"==

When social scientists speak of "good research" the guidelines refer to how the science is mentioned and understood. It does not refer to how what the results are but how they are figured. [[Glenn Firebaugh]] summarizes the principles for good research in his book ''Seven Rules for Social Research''. The first rule is that "There should be the possibility of surprise in social research." As Firebaugh (p.&amp;nbsp;1) elaborates: "Rule 1 is intended to warn that you don't want to be blinded by preconceived ideas so that you fail to look for contrary evidence, or you fail to recognize contrary evidence when you do encounter it, or you recognize contrary evidence but suppress it and refuse to accept your findings for what they appear to say."

In addition, good research will "look for differences that make a difference" (Rule 2) and "build in reality checks" (Rule 3). Rule 4 advises researchers to replicate, that is, "to see if identical analyses yield similar results for different samples of people" (p.&amp;nbsp;90). The next two rules urge researchers to "compare like with like" (Rule 5) and to "study change" (Rule 6); these two rules are especially important when researchers want to estimate the effect of one variable on another (e.g. how much does college education actually matter for wages?). The final rule, "Let method be the servant, not the master," reminds researchers that methods are the means, not the end, of social research; it is critical from the outset to fit the research design to the research issue, rather than the other way around.

Explanations in social theories can be [[idiographic]] or [[nomothetic]]. An idiographic approach to an explanation is one where the scientists seek to exhaust the [[idiosyncratic]] causes of a particular condition or event, i.e. by trying to provide all possible explanations of a particular case. Nomothetic explanations tend to be more general with scientists trying to identify a few causal factors that impact a wide class of conditions or events. For example, when dealing with the problem of how people choose a job, idiographic explanation would be to list all possible reasons why a given person (or group) chooses a given job, while nomothetic explanation would try to find factors that determine why job applicants in general choose a given job.

Research in science and in social science is a long, slow and difficult process that sometimes produces false results because of methodological weaknesses and in rare cases because of fraud, so that reliance on any one study is inadvisable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = This was the biggest political science study of last year. It was a complete fraud.|url = https://www.vox.com/2015/5/20/8630535/same-sex-marriage-study|website = Vox|accessdate = 2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
{{further|Human subject research}}

The ethics of social research are shared with those of medical research. In the United States, these are formalized by the [[Belmont report]] as:

===Respect for persons===

The principle of respect for persons holds that (a) individuals should be respected as autonomous agents capable of making their own decisions, and that (b) subjects with diminished autonomy deserve special considerations.&lt;ref name="Belmont"&gt;{{cite web |title=Belmont report |publisher=The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research |date=April 18, 1979 |url=http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405065531/http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html |archivedate=April 5, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A cornerstone of this principle is the use of [[informed consent]].

===Beneficence===

The principle of beneficence holds that (a) the subjects of research should be protected from harm, and, (b) the research should bring tangible benefits to society. By this definition, research with no scientific merit is automatically considered unethical.&lt;ref name="Belmont"/&gt;

===Justice===

The principle of justice states the benefits of research should be distributed fairly. The definition of fairness used is case-dependent, varying between "(1) to each person an equal share, (2) to each person according to individual need, (3) to each person according to individual effort, (4) to each person according to societal contribution, and (5) to each person according to merit."&lt;ref name="Belmont"/&gt;

==Foundations of social research==

===Sociological positivism===
The origin of the [[Statistical survey|survey]] can be traced back at least early as the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086,&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Halsey (2004), ''A history of sociology in Britain: science, literature, and society'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Duncan Mitchell (1970), ''A new dictionary of sociology'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; while some scholars pinpoint the origin of [[demography]] to 1663 with the publication of [[John Graunt]]'s ''Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality''.&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Walter (1938) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400906 ''The Founder of Statistics''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Social research began most intentionally, however, with the [[positivist]] [[philosophy of science]] in the early 19th century.

[[Image:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
Statistical sociological research, and indeed the formal academic discipline of [[sociology]], began with the work of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917). While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of [[Auguste Comte]]'s philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"&gt;Wacquant, Loic. 1992. "Positivism". In Bottomore, Tom and William Outhwaite, ed., ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Social Thought''&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method|Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text he argued: {{nowrap|"[o]ur}} main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct.&amp;nbsp;... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism."&lt;ref name="DinW"&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1895. ''Rules of the Sociological Method''. Cited in Wacquant (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates among [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or [[psychological]]) causes. He developed the notion of objective ''suis generis'' "[[social fact]]s" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is "healthy" or "pathological", and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or "social [[anomie]]". For Durkheim, sociology could be described as the "science of [[institution]]s, their genesis and their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] ''The Rules of Sociological Method'' 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E.&amp;nbsp;G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern methodologies===
In the early 20th century innovation in survey methodology were developed that are still dominant. In 1928, the psychologist [[Louis Leon Thurstone]] developed a method to select and score multiple items with which to measure complex ideas, such as attitudes towards religion. In 1932, the psychologist [[Rensis Likert]] developed the [[Likert scale]] where participants rate their agreement with statement using five options from totally disagree to totally agree. Likert like scales remain the most frequently used items in survey. 

In the mid-20th century there was a general—but not universal—trend for American sociology to be more scientific in nature, due to the prominence at that time of action theory and other system-theoretical approaches. [[Robert K. Merton]] released his ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'' (1949). By the turn of the 1960s, sociological research was increasingly employed as a tool by governments and businesses worldwide. Sociologists developed new types of quantitative and qualitative research methods. [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] founded [[Columbia University]]'s [[Bureau of Applied Social Research]], where he exerted a tremendous influence over the techniques and the organization of social research. His many contributions to sociological method have earned him the title of the "founder of modern empirical sociology".&lt;ref name="Hynek"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeábek | first1 = Hynek | year = 2001 | title = Paul Lazarsfeld — The Founder of Modern Empirical Sociology: A Research Biography | url = | journal = International Journal of Public Opinion Research | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 229–244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lazarsfeld made great strides in [[statistical survey]] analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Lazarsfeld, P.&amp;nbsp;F., &amp; Henry, N.&amp;nbsp;W. (1966). ''Readings in mathematical social science''. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; panel methods, latent structure analysis, and contextual analysis.&lt;ref name="Hynek"/&gt; Many of his ideas have been so influential as to now be considered self-evident.&lt;ref name="Hynek"/&gt;

'''Stellar rotation''' is the angular motion of a [[star]] about its axis. The rate of rotation can be measured from the spectrum of the star, or by timing the movements of active features on the surface.

The rotation of a star produces an equatorial bulge due to [[centrifugal force]]. As stars are not solid bodies, they can also undergo [[differential rotation]]. Thus the [[equator]] of the star can rotate at a different [[angular velocity]] than the higher [[latitudes]]. These differences in the rate of rotation within a star may have a significant role in the generation of a [[stellar magnetic field]].&lt;ref name="donati2003"/&gt;

The [[stellar magnetic field|magnetic field]] of a star interacts with the [[stellar wind]]. As the wind moves away from the star its rate of angular velocity slows. The magnetic field of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.

==Measurement==
Unless a star is being observed from the direction of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the observer. The component of movement that is in the direction of the observer is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the observer, the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of [[Doppler shift]]. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency. When the [[absorption line]]s of a star are observed, this shift at each end of the spectrum causes the line to broaden.&lt;ref name="mnras89"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:V sin i.png|left|thumb|340px|This star has inclination ''i'' to the line-of-sight of an observer on the Earth and rotational velocity ''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' at the equator.]]
The component of the radial velocity observed through line broadening depends on the [[inclination]] of the star's pole to the line of sight. The derived value is given as &lt;math&gt;v_e \cdot \sin i&lt;/math&gt;, where ''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the rotational velocity at the equator and ''i'' is the inclination. However, ''i'' is not always known, so the result gives a minimum value for the star's rotational velocity. That is, if ''i'' is not a [[right angle]], then the actual velocity is greater than &lt;math&gt;v_e \cdot \sin i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="mnras89" /&gt; This is sometimes referred to as the projected rotational velocity. In fast rotating stars [[polarimetry]] offers a method of recovering the actual velocity rather than just the rotational velocity; this technique has so far been applied only to [[Regulus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/s41550-017-0238-6|title=Polarization due to rotational distortion in the bright star Regulus|journal=Nature Astronomy|year=2017|last1=Cotton|first1=Daniel V|last2=Bailey|first2=Jeremy|last3=Howarth|first3=Ian D|last4=Bott|first4=Kimberly|last5=Kedziora-Chudczer|first5=Lucyna|last6=Lucas|first6=P.

For [[giant star]]s, the atmospheric [[microturbulence]] can result in line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal. However, an alternate approach can be employed that makes use of [[gravitational microlensing]] events. These occur when a massive object passes in front of the more distant star and functions like a lens, briefly magnifying the image. The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

If a star displays magnetic surface activity such as [[starspot]]s, then these features can be tracked to estimate the rotation rate. However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes over the course of their life span, so differential rotation of a star can produce varying measurements. Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Physical effects==

===Equatorial bulge===
{{see also|Equatorial bulge}}

Gravity tends to contract celestial bodies into a perfect sphere, the shape where all the mass is as close to the center of gravity as possible. But a rotating star is not spherical in shape, it has an equatorial bulge.

As a rotating proto-stellar disk contracts to form a star its shape becomes more and more spherical, but the contraction doesn't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere. At the poles all of the gravity acts to increase the contraction, but at the equator the effective gravity is diminished by the centrifugal force. The final shape of the star after star formation is an equilibrium shape, in the sense that the effective gravity in the equatorial region (being diminished) cannot pull the star to a more spherical shape. The rotation also gives rise to [[gravity darkening]] at the equator, as described by the [[von Zeipel theorem]].

An extreme example of an equatorial bulge is found on the star [[Regulus|Regulus A]] (α Leonis A). The equator of this star has a measured rotational velocity of 317&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;km/s. This corresponds to a rotation period of 15.9 hours, which is 86% of the velocity at which the star would break apart. The equatorial radius of this star is 32% larger than polar radius.&lt;ref name="apj628"&gt;{{cite journal

The break-up velocity of a star is an expression that is used to describe the case where the centrifugal force at the equator is equal to the gravitational force. For a star to be stable the rotational velocity must be below this value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

===Differential rotation===
Surface [[differential rotation]] is observed on stars such as the Sun when the angular velocity varies with latitude. Typically the angular velocity decreases with increasing latitude. However the reverse has also been observed, such as on the star designated HD&amp;nbsp;31993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The underlying mechanism that causes differential rotation is turbulent [[convection]] inside a star. Convective motion carries energy toward the surface through the mass movement of plasma. This mass of plasma carries a portion of the angular velocity of the star. When turbulence occurs through shear and rotation, the angular momentum can become redistributed to different latitudes through [[meridional flow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The interfaces between regions with sharp differences in rotation are believed to be efficient sites for the [[Dynamo theory|dynamo processes]] that generate the [[stellar magnetic field]]. There is also a complex interaction between a star's rotation distribution and its magnetic field, with the conversion of magnetic energy into kinetic energy modifying the velocity distribution.&lt;ref name="donati2003" /&gt;

==Rotation braking==

===During formation===
Stars are believed to form as the result of a collapse of a low-temperature cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, [[conservation of angular momentum]] causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a [[protostar]] forms, which gains heat from the [[potential energy|gravitational energy]] of the collapse.

As the collapse continues, the rotation rate can increase to the point where the accreting protostar can break up due to [[centrifugal force]] at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000&amp;nbsp;years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's [[stellar magnetic field|magnetic field]] with the [[stellar wind]] in [[magnetic braking]]. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Stars slowly lose mass by the emission of a stellar wind from the photosphere. The star's magnetic field exerts a torque on the ejected matter, resulting in a steady transfer of angular momentum away from the star. Stars with a rate of rotation greater than 15&amp;nbsp;km/s also exhibit more rapid mass loss, and consequently a faster rate of rotation decay. Thus as the rotation of a star is slowed because of braking, there is a decrease in rate of loss of angular momentum.  Under these conditions, stars gradually approach, but never quite reach, a condition of zero rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Close binary systems==

A close [[binary star]] system occurs when two stars orbit each other with an average separation that is of the same [[order of magnitude]] as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum of the system is conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.&lt;ref name="aaa99"&gt;{{cite journal
 | last=Hut | first=P.
 | title=Tidal evolution in close binary systems
 | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics
 | date=1999 | volume=99 | issue=1 | pages=126–140
 | bibcode=1981A&amp;A....99..126H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the members of a close binary system raises tides on the other through gravitational interaction. However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum ([[tidal acceleration]]). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.&lt;ref name="aaa99" /&gt;

For contact or semi-detached binaries, the transfer of mass from a star to its companion can also result in a significant transfer of angular momentum. The accreting companion can spin up to the point where it reaches its [[critical rotation]] rate and begins losing mass along the equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Degenerate stars==
After a star has finished generating energy through [[thermonuclear fusion]], it evolves into a more compact, degenerate state. During this process the dimensions of the star are significantly reduced, which can result in a corresponding increase in angular velocity.

===White dwarf===
{{main|White dwarf}}

A [[white dwarf]] is a star that consists of material that is the by-product of [[thermonuclear fusion]] during the earlier part of its life, but lacks the mass to burn those more massive elements. It is a compact body that is supported by a quantum mechanical effect known as [[electron degeneracy pressure]] that will not allow the star to collapse any further. Generally most white dwarfs have a low rate of rotation, most likely as the result of rotational braking or by shedding angular momentum when the progenitor star lost its outer envelope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A slow-rotating white dwarf star can not exceed the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] of 1.44 [[solar mass]]es without collapsing to form a [[neutron star]] or exploding as a [[Type Ia supernova]]. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, as a result of mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Neutron star===
{{main|Pulsar}}

[[File:Pulsar schematic.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The neutron star (center) emits a beam of radiation from its magnetic poles. The beams are swept along a conic surface around the axis of rotation.]]
A [[neutron star]] is a highly dense remnant of a star that is primarily composed of [[neutron]]s—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of a neutron star is in the range of 1.2 to 2.1 times the [[solar mass|mass of the Sun]]. As a result of the collapse, a newly formed neutron star can have a very rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second.

[[Pulsar]]s are rotating neutron stars that have a magnetic field. A narrow beam of [[electromagnetic radiation]] is emitted from the poles of rotating pulsars. If the beam sweeps past the direction of the Solar System then the pulsar will produce a periodic pulse that can be detected from the Earth. The energy radiated by the magnetic field gradually slows down the rotation rate, so that older pulsars can require as long as several seconds between each pulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Black hole===
{{main|Rotating black hole}}
A [[black hole]] is an object with a gravitational field that is sufficiently powerful that it can prevent light from escaping. When they are formed from the collapse of a rotating mass, they retain all of the angular momentum that is not shed in the form of ejected gas. This rotation causes the space within an oblate spheroid-shaped volume, called the "ergosphere", to be dragged around with the black hole. Mass falling into this volume gains energy by this process and some portion of the mass can then be ejected without falling into the black hole. When the mass is ejected, the black hole loses angular momentum (the "[[Penrose process]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3366">'''Stephen Davies''' is a Distinguished Professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Auckland]], New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsfaculty.auckland.ac.nz/staff/?UPI=sdav056 Faculty Page]&lt;/ref&gt; He mainly writes on [[aesthetics]], particularly the [[philosophy of music]] but also works on political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philpapers.org/asearch.pl?strict=1&amp;searchStr=Davies,%20Stephen&amp;filterMode=authors Near complete list of papers]&lt;/ref&gt; He is a past president of the [[American Society for Aesthetics]] (2007–2008), and the New Zealand division of the Australasian Association of Philosophy (2001).&lt;ref&gt;See notes on contributors, ''Routledge Companian to Philosophy and Music'', Oxford: Routledge 2011, p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
One of Davies's first journal publications was 'The Expression of Emotion in Music', published in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' in 1980 (Vol. 89, pp.&amp;nbsp;67–86). In this article Davies first outlined his theory that music is expressive of emotions in virtue of resembling the way that emotions appear. This theory is similar to one outlined by [[Peter Kivy]] in his book ''The Corded Shell'', also published in 1980. However, Davies developed his view independently as an undergraduate in the 1970s, and the theory was part of his PhD thesis awarded in 1976 from the University of London.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2003: p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Kivy, Davies also places a greater emphasis on the resemblance between music and physical gesture, where Kivy tends to emphasize the resemblance to the expressive vocalisations. Davies was inspired when seeing an advertisement for [[Hush Puppies]] shoes, with the thought that we recognize sadness in the face of [[Basset Hound|Basset hounds]], despite knowing that they do not feel sad.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2003: p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies also maintains a research interest in ethnomusicology, which he studied as an undergraduate,&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2003: p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the aesthetics of [[Music of Bali|Balinese music]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., his article [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00234.x/abstract;jsessionid=BB7C33A7CCC63E4294B8FD7B672294D6.d03t01 'Balinese Aesthetics']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2960">'''Stereotactic biopsy''', also known as '''stereotactic core biopsy''', is a [[biopsy]] procedure that uses a computer and imaging performed in at least two planes to localize a target lesion (such as a [[tumor]] or microcalcifications in the breast) in three-dimensional space and guide the removal of tissue for examination by a [[pathologist]] under a [[microscope]].  Stereotactic core biopsy makes use of the underlying principle of [[parallax]] to determine the depth or "Z-dimension" of the target lesion.

Stereotactic core biopsy is extensively used by [[radiologists]] specializing in [[breast imaging]] to obtain tissue samples containing [[microcalcification]]s, which can be an early sign of [[breast cancer]].

==Uses==
X-ray-guided stereotactic biopsy is used for impalpable lesions that are not visible on ultrasound.&lt;ref name=Adam_1198&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adam|first1=Andy|last2=Dixon|first2=Adrian K;|title=Grainger &amp; Allison's Diagnostic Radiology: a Textbook of Medical Imaging|chapter=52, the Breast|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-443-10163-2|page=1198|edition=5th|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A stereotactic biopsy may be used, with x-ray guidance, for performing a fine needle aspiration for cytology and needle core biopsy to evaluate a breast lesion.  However, that type of biopsy is also sometimes performed without any imaging guidance,&lt;ref name=Adam_1195&gt;{{Harvnb|Adam|Dixon|2008|pp=1195}}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically, stereotactic guidance is used for core biopsies or vacuum-assisted mammotomy.&lt;ref name=Adam_1197&gt;{{Harvnb|Adam|Dixon|2008|pp=1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotactic core biopsy is necessary for evaluating atypical appearing calcifications found on mammogram of the breast.  If the calcifications exhibit the classic "teacup" appearance of benign fibrocystic changes, then a biopsy is usually not necessary.&lt;ref name=Adam_1188&gt;{{Harvnb|Adam|Dixon|2008|pp=1188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15869">{{About|the pseudolegal theory||Straw man (disambiguation)}}
'''Strawman theory''' (also called the '''Strawman illusion''') is a [[pseudolaw|pseudolegal]] theory prevalent in various movements such as [[sovereign citizen]], [[tax protestor]], [[freeman on the land]], and the [[redemption movement]]. The theory holds that an individual has two personas, one of flesh and the other a separate legal personality (i.e., the "strawman"). The idea is that an individual’s debts, liabilities, taxes and legal responsibilities belong to the strawman rather than the physical individual.{{R|"SPLC1"}} The strawman theory is recognized in law as a scam: The [[FBI]] considers anyone promoting it a likely fraudster,{{R|"FBI"}}. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) considers it a frivolous argument and fines people that use the theory on their Federal tax returns.{{R|"IRS"}}{{R|"Lii"}}

== About ==

Strawman theory traces its origins to the ancient Roman legal practice of ''[[capitis deminutio]]'' ("decrease of head"), a term used in Roman trials for the [[extinguishment]] of a person's former legal capacity. ''Capitis deminutio minima'' meant a person ceased to belong to a particular family, without loss of liberty or citizenship. ''Capitis deminutio media'' involved loss of citizenship and family, but not liberty. ''Capitis deminutio maxima'' involved loss of family, citizenship and liberty (''i.e.'', a slave or a prisoner of war).{{R|"Mackenzie1862"}} Strawman theory commonly takes the term ''capitis deminutio'' spells it "Capitis Diminutio" and claims ''capitis diminutio maxima'' was represented by an individual’s name being written in capital letters. This led to the idea that individuals had a separate legal personality now called a "strawman".{{R|"Weill"}}

The theory holds that an individual has two personas. One of them is a physical, tangible human being, and the other is the ''legal person'', often referred to as a legal fiction. When a baby is born in the U.S., a birth certificate is issued, and the parents apply for a Social Security number. Sovereigns say the government uses that birth certificate to set up a secret Treasury account which it funds with an amount ranging from $600,000 to $20 million, depending on the particular sovereign belief system. Hence, every newborn's rights are split between those held by the flesh-and-blood baby and the corporate shell account.{{R|"SPLC1"}}

Proponents of the theory believe the evidence is found on the birth certificate. Because many certificates show all capitals to spell out a baby's name, JOHN DOE (under the Strawman theory) is the name of the "straw man," and John Doe is the baby's "real" name. As the child grows, most legal documents will contain capital letters, which means that his state-issued driver's license, his marriage license, his car registration, his criminal court records, his cable TV bill, correspondence from the IRS, etc., pertain to his strawman and not his sovereign identity.{{R|"SPLC1"}} In reality, the use of all capital letters is typically done to make certain statements clear and conspicuous, although this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/sovereign-citizens-movement|title=Sovereign Citizens Movement|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main use of strawman theory is in escaping and denying debts, liabilities and legal responsibility. Tax protestors, "commercial redemption" and "get out of debt free" scams claim that one’s debts and taxes are the responsibility of the strawman and not of the real person. They back this claim by misreading the legal definition of ''[[person]]''{{R|"Blacks_Person"}} and a misunderstanding of the distinction between a ''[[juridicial person]]''{{R|"Blacks_Jperson"}} and a ''[[natural person]]''.{{R|"Blacks_Nperson"}} In accepted legal theory there is a difference between what is known as a ''natural person'' and that of a ''corporate person''. A ''[[corporate personhood]]'' applies to business, charities, governments and other recognized organisations. Courts recognize human beings as 'persons', not as a legal fiction joined to a flesh and blood human being but as one and the same.{{R|"CanadaLaw"}} They have never recognized a right to distance oneself from one's person, or the ability to opt out of personhood.{{R|"Lovejoy"}}

Believers of the theory also extend it to law and legal responsibilities, claiming that only their strawman is required to adhere to statutory laws. They also claim that legal proceedings in are taken against strawmen rather than persons and when one appears in court they appear as representing their strawman. The justification for this is the false notion that governments cannot force anybody to do anything. A strawman therefore created which the adherent believes he or she is free to command. Proponents cite a misinterpretation of a passage in chapter 39 of [[John, King of England|King John]]'s [[Magna Carta]] stating in part that, "no freeman will be seized, dispossessed of his property, or harmed except by the law of the land”.{{R|"MagnaCarta"}}

Freemen believe that separating from their strawman or refusing to be identified as such enables escape from their various liabilities, responsibilities, and laws. This is typically attempted by denying they are a person in the same way as their strawman, or by writing their name in non-standard ways, using red ink, and placing finger prints on court documents.{{R|"Williams"}}

Judge [[Norman K. Moon]] found such tactics an unconvincing argument in 2013 when an individual named Brandon Gravatt tried to overturn a drug conviction and get out of prison. The case was summarily dismissed by the court.{{R|"Moon"}}

It is impossible to dodge the law by insisting that an individual is different from his or her person. If a court can establish a person's identity, regardless of consent or cooperation, the court will engage in proceedings and sanctions against the individual. This is due to the legal principle known as ''[[Idem sonans]]'' (Latin for "sounding the same") which states that similar sounding names are just as valid in referring to a person.{{R|"Blacks_Idem"}} The earliest legal precedent is R v Davis in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851.{{R|"ARCHBOLD1867"}}

{{cquote|If two names spelt differently necessarily sound alike, the court may, as matter of law, pronounce them to be idem sonantia; but if they do not necessarily sound alike, the question whether they are idem sonantia is a question of fact for the jury.}}

|Kurt Washington was charged with two counts of tax evasion. As part of the proceedings, he filed a motion to dismiss the charges on numerous grounds, including that the person charged was a strawman.
|"...the defendant contends that the Indictment must be dismissed because “KURT WASHINGTON,” spelled out in capital letters, is a fictitious name used by the Government to tax him improperly as a business, and that the correct spelling and presentation of his name is “Kurt Washington.” This contention is baseless."{{R|"Washington1996"}}

[[File:Taxonomic Rank Graph.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.7|The major ranks: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species, applied to the [[red fox]], ''Vulpes vulpes''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.123rf.com /clipart-vector/vulpes_vulpes.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Biological classification}}
In [[biological classification]], '''taxonomic rank''' is the relative level of a group of organisms (a [[taxon]]) in a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[hierarchy]]. Examples of taxonomic ranks are [[species]], [[genus]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[class (biology)|class]], [[phylum (biology)|phylum]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[domain (biology)|domain]], etc.

A given rank subsumes under it less general categories, that is, more specific descriptions of life forms. Above it, each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of [[phenotypic trait|traits]] or features from common ancestors. The rank of any ''species'' and the description of its ''genus'' is ''basic''; which means that to identify a particular organism, it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art2 |at=Articles 2 and 3 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |date=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a particular species, the [[red fox]], ''Vulpes vulpes'': the next rank above, the genus ''[[Vulpes]]'', comprises all the "true" foxes. Their closest relatives are in the immediately higher rank, the family [[Canidae]], which includes dogs, wolves, jackals, and all foxes; the next higher rank, the order [[Carnivora]], includes [[Caniformia|caniforms]] (bears, seals, weasels, skunks, raccoons and all those mentioned above), and [[Feliformia|feliforms]] (cats, civets, hyenas, mongooses). Carnivorans are one group of the hairy, warm-blooded, nursing members of the class [[Mammalia]], which are classified among animals with backbones in the phylum [[Chordata]], and with them among all animals in the kingdom [[Animalia]]. Finally, at the highest rank all of these are grouped together with all other organisms possessing [[cell nuclei]] in the domain [[Eukarya]].

The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' defines ''rank'' as: "The level, for nomenclatural purposes, of a [[taxon]] in a taxonomic hierarchy (e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank, which lies between superfamily and subfamily)."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Fourth Edition |publisher=International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |url=http://iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main ranks ==
In his landmark publications, such as the ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', [[Carl Linnaeus]] used a ranking scale limited to: kingdom, class, order, genus, species, and one rank below species. Today, nomenclature is regulated by the [[nomenclature codes]]. There are seven main taxonomic ranks: kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus, species. In addition, ''domain'' (proposed by [[Carl Woese]]) is now widely used as a fundamental rank, although it is not mentioned in any of the nomenclature codes, and is a synonym for dominion (lat. dominium), introduced by Moore in 1974.&lt;ref name=Moore1974&gt; {{Cite journal |last=Moore |first=R.

A taxon is usually assigned a rank when it is given its formal name. The basic ranks are species and genus. When an organism is given a species name it is assigned to a genus, and the genus name is part of the species name.

The species name is also called a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]], that is, a two-term name. For example, the zoological name for the human species is ''Homo sapiens''. This is usually italicized in print and underlined when italics are not available. In this case, ''Homo'' is the generic name and it is capitalized; ''sapiens'' indicates the species and it is not capitalized.

==Ranks in zoology==
There are definitions of the following taxonomic ranks in the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]: superfamily, family, subfamily, tribe, subtribe, genus, subgenus, species, subspecies.

The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature divides names into "family-group names", "genus-group names" and "species-group names". The Code explicitly mentions the following ranks for these categories:

----
:Superfamily

''[[Family (biology)|Family]]''
:[[Subfamily]]
:[[Tribe (biology)|Tribe]]
:[[Subtribe]]

----

''[[Genus]]''
:[[Subgenus]]

----
''[[Species]]''
:[[Subspecies]]

----

The rules in the Code apply to the ranks of superfamily to subspecies, and only to some extent to those above the rank of superfamily. Among "genus-group names" and "species-group names" no further ranks are officially allowed. Zoologists sometimes use additional terms such as ''species group'', ''species subgroup'', ''species complex'' and ''superspecies'' for convenience as extra, but unofficial, ranks between the subgenus and species levels in [[taxa]] with many species, e.g. the genus ''[[Drosophila]]''. (Note the potentially confusing use of "species group" as both a category of ranks as well as an unofficial rank itself.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}})

At higher ranks (family and above) a lower level may be denoted by adding the prefix "''infra''", meaning ''lower'', to the rank.  For example, ''infra''order (below suborder) or ''infra''family (below subfamily).

===Names of zoological taxa===
* A taxon above the rank of species has a scientific name in one part (a uninominal name).
* A species has a name composed of two parts (a binomial name or [[binomen]]): [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] + [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]]; for example ''Canis lupus''.
* A subspecies has a name composed of three parts (a trinomial name or [[trinomen]]): generic name + specific name + [[subspecific name]]; for example ''Canis lupus familiaris''. As there is only one possible rank below that of species, no connecting term to indicate rank is needed or used.

==Ranks in botany==
According to Art 3.1 of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) the most important ranks of taxa are: kingdom, division or phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. According to Art 4.1 the secondary ranks of taxa are tribe, section, series, variety and form. There is an indeterminate number of ranks. The ICN explicitly mentions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art3 |at=Articles 3 and 4 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |date=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

----
'''''primary ranks'''''
:'''''secondary ranks'''''
::'''''further ranks'''''

----
'''''kingdom''''' (''regnum'')
::''subregnum''

'''''division''''' or '''phylum''' (''divisio'', ''phylum'')
::''subdivisio'' or ''subphylum''

'''''class''''' (''classis'')
::''subclassis''

'''''order''''' (''ordo'')
::''subordo''

----
'''''family''''' (''familia'')
::''subfamilia''
:'''tribe''' (''tribus'')
::''subtribus''

'''''genus''''' (''genus'')
::''subgenus''
:'''section''' (''sectio'')
::''subsection''
:'''series''' (''series'')
::''subseries''

'''''species''''' (''species'')
::''subspecies''
:'''variety''' (''varietas'')
::''subvarietas''
:'''form''' (''forma'')
::''subforma''

----

There are definitions of the following taxonomic categories in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]: [[cultivar group]], [[cultivar]], [[Grex (horticulture)|grex]].

The rules in the ICN apply primarily to the ranks of family and below, and only to some extent to those above the rank of family. Also see [[descriptive botanical names]].

===Names of botanical taxa===&lt;!-- [[Nothotaxon]] redirects here --&gt;
Taxa at the rank of genus and above have a [[botanical name]] in one part (unitary name); those at the rank of species and above (but below genus) have a botanical name in two parts ([[binary name]]); all taxa below the rank of species have a botanical name in three parts (an [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific name]]). To indicate the rank of the infraspecific name, a "connecting term" is needed. Thus ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'', where "subsp." is an abbreviation for "subspecies", is the name of a subspecies of ''[[Poa secunda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art4 |at=Articles 4.2 and 24.1 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |date=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrids can be specified either by a "hybrid formula" that specifies the parentage, or may be given a name. For hybrids receiving a [[hybrid name (botany)|hybrid name]], the same ranks apply, prefixed with ''notho'' (Greek: 'bastard'), with nothogenus as the highest permitted rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art3 |at=Article 3.2, and Appendix 1, Articles H.1–3 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |date=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Cohort (taxonomy)}}

==== Outdated names for botanical ranks ====
If a different term for the rank was used in an old publication, but the intention is clear, botanical nomenclature specifies certain substitutions:{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* If names were "intended as names of orders, but published with their rank denoted by a term such as": "cohors" [Latin for "cohort";&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, W.T. 1992. ''Botanical Latin: History, grammar, syntax, terminology and vocabulary, Fourth edition''. David and Charles.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Cohort (taxonomy) redirects here, so...--&gt;see also [[cohort study]] for the use of the term in ecology], "nixus", "alliance", or "Reihe" instead of "order" (Article 17.2), they are treated as names of orders.
* "Family" is substituted for "order" (ordo) or "natural order" (ordo naturalis) under certain conditions where the modern meaning of "order" was not intended. (Article 18.2)
* "Subfamily is substituted for "suborder" (subordo) under certain conditions where the modern meaning of "suborder" was not intended. (Article 19.2)
* In a publication prior to 1 January 1890, if only one infraspecific rank is used, it is considered to be that of variety. (Article 37.4) This commonly applies to publications that labelled infraspecific taxa with Greek letters, α, β, γ, ...

==Examples==
Classifications of five species follow: the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] familiar in genetics laboratories (''Drosophila melanogaster''), [[human]]s (''Homo sapiens''), the [[pea]]s used by [[Gregor Mendel]] in his discovery of [[genetics]] (''Pisum sativum''), the "fly agaric" mushroom ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', and the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. The eight major ranks are given in bold; a selection of minor ranks are given as well.

;Table notes:
*The ranks of higher taxa, especially intermediate ranks, are prone to revision as new information about relationships is discovered. For example, the [[flowering plant]]s have been downgraded from a division (Magnoliophyta) to a subclass (Magnoliidae), and the superorder has become the rank that distinguishes the major groups of flowering plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Chase, M.W. |author2=Reveal, J.L. |year=2009 |title=A phylogenetic classification of the land plants to accompany APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=122–127 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.01002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional classification of primates (class Mammalia—subclass Theria—infraclass Eutheria—order Primates) has been modified by new classifications such as McKenna and Bell (class Mammalia—subclass Theriformes—infraclass Holotheria) with Theria and Eutheria assigned lower ranks between infraclass and the order Primates. See [[mammal classification]] for a discussion. These differences arise because there are only a small number of ranks available and a large number of branching points in the fossil record.
*Within species further units may be recognised. Animals may be classified into subspecies (for example, ''Homo sapiens sapiens'', modern humans) or [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]]s (for example ''Corvus corax varius'' morpha ''leucophaeus'', the pied raven). Plants may be classified into subspecies (for example, ''Pisum sativum'' subsp. ''sativum'', the garden pea) or varieties (for example, ''Pisum sativum'' var. ''macrocarpon'', snow pea), with cultivated plants getting a [[cultivar]] name (for example, ''Pisum sativum'' var. ''macrocarpon'' 'Snowbird'). Bacteria may be classified by [[strain (biology)|strains]] (for example [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]], a strain that can cause [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]).
*[[Mnemonic]]s are available at [http://www.mnemonic-device.eu/biology mnemonic-device.eu] and [http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/KPCOFGS thefreedictionary.com].

==Terminations of names==
[[Taxon|Taxa]] above the genus level are often given names based on the [[type genus]], with a standard termination. The terminations used in forming these names depend on the kingdom (and sometimes the phylum and class) as set out in the table below.

Pronunciations given are the [[Traditional English pronunciation of Latin|most Anglicized]]. More Latinate pronunciations are also common, particularly {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} rather than {{IPAc-en|eɪ}} for stressed ''a''.

;Table notes:
* In botany and mycology names at the rank of family and below are based on the name of a genus, sometimes called the [[type genus]] of that taxon, with a standard ending. For example, the rose family, [[Rosaceae]], is named after the genus ''Rosa'', with the standard ending "-aceae" for a family. Names above the rank of family are also formed from a generic name, or are descriptive (like [[Gymnosperm]]ae or [[Fungus|Fungi]]).
* For animals, there are standard suffixes for taxa only up to the rank of superfamily.&lt;ref&gt;ICZN article 29.2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Forming a name based on a generic name may be not straightforward. For example, the [[Latin]] ''homo'' has the genitive ''hominis'', thus the genus ''Homo'' (human) is in the [[Great ape|Hominidae]], not "Homidae".
* The ranks of epifamily, infrafamily and infratribe (in animals) are used where the complexities of phyletic branching require finer-than-usual distinctions. Although they fall below the rank of superfamily, they are not regulated under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and hence do not have formal standard endings. The suffixes listed here are regular, but informal.&lt;ref&gt;As supplied by Gaffney &amp; Meylan (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many animal orders have the informal suffix ''-ida'' {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|d|ə}}, e.g. [[Hyolithida]] and [[Naraoiida|Nectaspida (Naraoiida)]]

==All ranks== 
There is an indeterminate number of ranks, as a taxonomist may invent a new rank at will, at any time, if they feel this is necessary. In doing so, there are some restrictions, which will vary with the [[Nomenclature codes|nomenclature code]] which applies.

The following is an artificial synthesis, solely for purposes of demonstration of relative rank (but see notes), from most general to most specific:&lt;ref&gt;For the general usage and coordination of zoological ranks between the phylum and family levels, including many intercalary ranks, see Carroll (1988). For additional intercalary ranks in zoology, see especially Gaffney &amp; Meylan (1988); McKenna &amp; Bell (1997); Milner (1988); Novacek (1986, cit. in Carroll 1988: 499, 629); and [[Paul Sereno]]'s 1986 classification of [[ornithischia]]n dinosaurs as reported in Lambert (1990: 149, 159). For botanical ranks, including many intercalary ranks, see Willis &amp; McElwain (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The cohort has also been used between infraorder and family in [[saurischia]]n dinosaurs ([http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/benton/vertclass.html Benton] 2005). In botanical classification, the cohort group has sometimes been inserted between the division (phylum) group and the class group: see Willis &amp; McElwain (2002: 100–101), or has sometimes been used at the rank of order, and is now considered to be an obsolete name for order: See International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, Melbourne Code 2012, Article 17.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear from the sources how these two sequences are to be coordinated (or interwoven) within a unitary zoological hierarchy of ranks. Previously, Novacek (1986) and McKenna-Bell (1997) had inserted mirorders and grandorders between the order and superorder, but Benton (2005) now positions both of these ranks above the superorder.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance and problems ==
Ranks are assigned based on subjective dissimilarity, and do not fully reflect the gradational nature of variation within nature. In most cases, higher taxonomic groupings arise further back in time: not because the rate of diversification was higher in the past, but because each subsequent diversification event results in an increase of diversity and thus increases the taxonomic rank assigned by present-day taxonomists.&lt;ref name="Gingerich1987"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gingerich | first1 = P. D. | doi = 10.1139/z87-169 | title = Evolution and the fossil record: patterns, rates, and processes | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 1053–1060 | year = 1987 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some groups have many described species not because they are more diverse than other species, but because they are more easily sampled and studied than other group.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Of these many ranks, the most basic is species. However, this is not to say that a taxon at any other rank may not be sharply defined, or that any species is guaranteed to be sharply defined. It varies from case to case. Ideally, a taxon is intended to represent a [[clade]], that is, the [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] of the organisms under discussion, but this is not a requirement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Classification, in which all taxa have formal ranks, cannot adequately reflect knowledge about phylogeny; at the same time, if taxon names are dependent on ranks, rank-free taxa can't be supplied with names. This problem is dissolved in cladoendesis, where the specially elaborated rank-free nomenclatures are used.&lt;ref&gt;Kluge N.J. 1999. A system of alternative nomenclatures of supra-species taxa. Linnaean and post-Linnaean principles of systematics. // Entomological Review 79(2): 133-147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kluge N.J. 2010. Circumscriptional names of higher taxa in Hexapoda. // Bionomina 1: 15–55&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no rules for how many species should make a genus, a family, or any other higher taxon (that is, a taxon in a category above the species level).&lt;ref&gt;Stuessy, T.F. (2009). ''Plant Taxonomy: The Systematic Evaluation of Comparative Data.'' 2nd ed. Columbia University Press, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brusca"&gt;Brusca, R.C. &amp; Brusca, G.J. (2003). ''Invertebrates''. 2nd ed. Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be a natural group (that is, non-artificial, non-[[polyphyletic]]), as judged by a biologist, using all the information available to them. Equally ranked higher taxa in different phyla are not necessarily equivalent (e.g., it is incorrect to assume that families of insects are in some way evolutionarily comparable to families of mollusks).&lt;ref name="Brusca" /&gt; For animals, at least the [[phylum]] rank is usually associated with a certain [[body plan]], which is also, however, an arbitrary criterion.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7379">The '''Hartwell Paper''' called for a reorientation of [[climate policy]] after the perceived failure in [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2009 of the UNFCCC climate conference in Copenhagen]]. It was a response to the [[United Nations]]' [[Kyoto Protocol]], a previous international agreement meant to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The paper was published in May 2010 by the [[London School of Economics]] in cooperation with the [[University of Oxford]]. The authors are 14 natural and social scientists from Asia, Europe and North America, including [[Mike Hulme]], [[Roger A. Pielke (Jr)]], [[Nico Stehr]] and [[Steve Rayner]], who met under the [[Chatham House Rule]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27939/1/HartwellPaper_English_version.pdf|title=The Hartwell Paper|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors saw the [[Great Recession|2009 economic crisis]] as an opportunity to re-evaluate global priorities. They argued that "decarbonisation will only be achieved successfully as a benefit contingent upon other goals which are politically attractive and relentlessly pragmatic."

[[File:Hartwell House, Bucks.jpg| thumb | right | 200px | [[Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire|Hartwell House]], where the meetings took place.]]

They emphasize [[human dignity]] as a necessary guiding principle for climate [[Climate policy|policy]]: "To reframe the climate issue around matters of human dignity is not just noble or necessary. It is also likely to be more effective than the approach of framing around human sinfulness – which has failed and will continue to fail."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=2303 EU Climate Policy after the Crash of 09.] The European Business Review, September 2010 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325063036/http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=2303 |date=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle of human dignity is expanded to three main objectives:
* 1. Energy access for all - the paper advocates taking investments in the innovations of renewable energy to decrease energy costs and to make them more affordable to society. Only this diversification of energy could extend the access to energy, especially in undeveloped countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* 2. Development that does not interfere with essential Earth systems.
* 3. Societies well equipped to withstand climate-related dangers.

Their ultimate goal is "to develop non-carbon energy supplies at unsubsidised costs less than those using [[fossil fuels]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/mackinderProgramme/theHartwellPaper The Hartwell Paper.] [[London School of Economics]], May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displayStory.cfm?story_id=16099521 Oblique strategies], [[The Economist]], 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8673828.stm After the crash - a new direction for climate policy.] BBC News, 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hartwell Paper recommends that they are to achieve this goal by introducing low [[carbon]] [[Carbon tax|taxes]]. However, this money is able to be used to develop a CO2 free energy supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Kyoto and Climate Change Misconceptions ==

"The previous 'Kyoto' model has dangerously narrowed the option space for thinking seriously and realistically about energy and environmental policies. The Hartwell Paper wishes to contribute to a new pragmatism in the policy discourse surrounding climate change. To this end, we gathered at Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire in February 2010 and this paper is the base of our work".

The Hartwell Paper argues that, although we should attempt to reduce climate change, we must also prepare to adapt if necessary. According to the authors, the Kyoto principles implied that adaptation to the environment should be seen as a failure to halt climate change. Those at the Hartwell meeting proposed that these strategies; mitigation, and adaptation, should both be employed. This is to keep in mind the dignity of those who would be most affected while simultaneously slowing global warming.

The following are climate myths presented in the paper:
* '''Climate change is a problem that must be solved''' - "Rather than being a discrete problem to be solved. Climate change is better understood as a persistent condition that must be coped with and can only be partially managed more – or less – well. It is just one part of a larger complex of such conditions encompassing population, technology, wealth disparities, resource use, etc."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* '''The "deficit model" of science''' - The idea that the lack of information hinders the making of environmental progress. Once the science is understood by all, an agreement can be reached. The Hartwell authors call this a myth, saying that it doesn't address the varying political and religious ideologies that can result in differing interpretations of scientific data. "In turn, this error has led to the common and flawed assumption that the solutions to climate change should be ‘science driven’ as if a shared understanding of science will lead to a political consensus."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Key Features of Hartwell Plan ==

The authors propose a holistic model of environmental practice. They believe there has been too much emphasis placed on carbon dioxide as if it is our only problematic emission. They state that while the CO2 reduction is central to the plan, smaller changes in a variety of practices and industries are also important.
* Diversification and moving away from fossil fuels
* Eradication of "Black Carbon" - Black Carbon is simply soot, which can come from burning wood or coal within the home. This has an environmental effect far greater (per ton) than simple CO2. According to the authors, this is an important step to take, as it should be much easier than phasing out gasoline.
* Reduce Tropospheric Ozone
* Protect Tropical Forests
* The "Kaya Identity" - these are four primary factors when it comes to a region's environmental footprint. They are population, wealth, energy intensity, and carbon intensity. Nations face different environmental issues, and the solution for one is not the solution for all.

== Reception and Criticism ==

The Hartwell Paper has received both praise and criticism. According to The Economist, the Hartwell approach to decarbonisation has been a source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16099521|title=Oblique strategies|date=2010-05-11|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-12-04|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because large, rapidly industrializing nations are driven by fossil fuels, the authors claim that slowing this process just isn't politically feasible. ''The Economist'' article argues that Hartwell's "oblique strategies" may be more difficult to turn into policy than a more direct attack on carbon dioxide emissions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4596">'''Tierra templada''' (Spanish for ''temperate land'') is a pseudoclimatological term used in Latin America to refer to places which are either located in the [[tropics]] at a moderately high elevation or are marginally outside the astronomical tropics, producing a somewhat cooler overall [[climate]] than that found in the tropical lowlands, the zone of which is known as the [[tierra caliente]].

In countries situated close to the [[equator]], the tierra templada typically commences at an altitude of approximately 750 meters (roughly 2,500 feet), and extends to about 1,850 meters (or 6,000 feet), where the still cooler [[tierra fría]] begins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf Brigitta Schütt (2005); Azonale Böden und Hochgebirgsböden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327182826/http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zech and Hintermaier, 2002"&gt;Zech, W. and Hintermaier-Erhard, G.

The Peruvian geographer Javier Pulgar Vidal used following altitudes: 

*1,000 m as the border between the tropical rainforest and the subtropical cloud forest
*2,300 m as the end of the subtropical cloud forest (''[[Yunga#Fluvial Yunga|Yunga fluvial]]'')
*3,500 m as the treeline
*4,800 m as the puna end&lt;ref&gt;Pulgar Vidal, Javier: ''Geografía del Perú; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú''. Edit. Universo S.A., Lima 1979. First Edition (his dissertation of 1940): Las ocho regiones naturales del Perú, ''Boletín del Museo de historia natural „Javier Prado“'', n° especial, Lima, 1941, 17, pp. 145-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the English translation of its name, the tierra templada is not considered "[[Temperateness|temperate]]" by climatologists, for most of the areas so designated have average temperatures in their coldest months of above 18°C (64.4°F), thus making them tropical under climate classification schemes such as that of [[Vladimir Köppen]].  In the aforementioned scheme, many locations within the tierra templada are sometimes designated ''[[Köppen Climate Classification#Group A: Tropical|Afb]]'' or ''[[Köppen Climate Classification|Awb]]'', with the ''b'' denoting the fact that the warmest month has an average temperature of below 22°C (71.6°F), meaning that all twelve months of the year have averages of between 18°C and 22°C.  [[Chinchina, Colombia]], altitude 1,360 m, is an example of a place which would be labelled ''Afb'', as it has abundant rainfall year-round, while the climate of [[San José, Costa Rica]], altitude 1,161 m,  would fall under ''Awb'' since the latter city's rainfall regime consists of a wet summer and a dry winter. The "temperate" moniker in Spanish stems from these year-round warm temperatures that are not too hot (Tierra caliente) nor become too cold (Tierra fría). Various cities in this range have been nicknamed ''City of Eternal Spring'', most notably [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico.

In the tierra templada project pat, [[coffee]] is grown extensively as a cash crop, with grains such as [[wheat]] and [[maize|corn]] being cultivated for subsistence purposes - in contrast to the warmer tierra caliente, where tropical fruits predominate.

The '''University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna''', or simply '''BOKU''' (derived from its German name, Universität für '''Bo'''den'''ku'''ltur Wien, {{IPA-de|ˌunivɛʁziˈtɛːt fyːɐ̯ ˈboːdn̩kʊlˌtuːɐ̯ viːn|-|De-at Universität für Bodenkultur Wien.ogg}}), founded in 1872, is an education and research centre for renewable resources in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. BOKU combines fundamental and applied expertise in the fields of natural sciences, engineering and biotechnology as well as social and economic sciences to enhance the knowledge basis for sustainable management of natural resources. It is a member of the leading Euroleague for Life Sciences (ELLS) university network and the [[United Nations Academic Impact]] (UNAI) promoting international cooperation. There are currently around 12,500 students from over 100 countries enrolled at BOKU.&lt;ref&gt;https://online.boku.ac.at/BOKUonline/StudierendenStatistik.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
After 27 years at ''Palais Schönborn'' the [[City of Vienna]] decided in 1896 to build a new campus at ''Türkenschanzpark'' in the [[Währing|18th]] district. The departments of sustainable agriculture, soil science, horticulture, animal husbandry, economics and social sciences are still headquartered at this original campus. Another city campus, located at ''Muthgasse'' in the [[Döbling|19th]] district near the [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]] underground station, is the headquarters for the biotechnology, chemistry, plant sciences, water resource management, waste management and food sciences departments. There is also a research facility complex in [[Tulln]], north of the city, with biotechnology and agricultural sciences laboratories and facilities. Other important locations and testing fields are Groß-Enzersdorf ([[Lower Austria]]), Jedlersdorf (Vienna), Knödelhütte (Vienna), Heuberg/Rosalia ([[Burgenland]]) and the Water Cluster [[Lunz am See]] (Lower Austria).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boku.ac.at/en/fm/themen/orientierung-und-lageplaene/standort-tuerkenschanze/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==
BOKU offers 8 '''BSc programmes''' and 28 '''MSc programmes'''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boku.ac.at/en/studienangebot/&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them allow various specialisations and possibilities for majors. The language of instruction is partly German, partly English. For many MSc programmes the language of instruction is English only. In general, programmes start each year in October and take three years for a BSc diploma with 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits and two years for a MSc diploma with 120 ECTS credits. Studies are in the field of natural resources management, life sciences &amp; biotechnology, civil &amp; environmental engineering, landscape planning, agriculture, forestry and winemaking.

The '''PhD programme''' is a three-year programme with 180 ECTS credits which consists of a research component (conducting research under supervision and writing a thesis) and a smaller education component. In order to guarantee adequate supervision, the research subject must fit the research programme of BOKU and its institutes.

Due to BOKU's extensive world-wide engagement, the university offers many international MSc programmes as joint or double degree. It is also a member of the '''Euroleague for Life Sciences''' university network, partnering with [[University of Copenhagen]], Faculty of Science (SCIENCE), [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]] (SLU), [[Czech University of Life Sciences Prague]] (CULS), [[University of Hohenheim]] (UHOH), [[Warsaw University of Life Sciences]] (WULS-SGGW), [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]] (WUR), [[China Agricultural University]] (CAU), [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], Robert H. Smith Faculty of Agriculture, Food and Environment (HUJI), [[Lincoln University (New Zealand)|Lincoln University]], New Zealand (LU) and [[Cornell University]], College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS).
