==Plot==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
Six prep college students and a biker couple travel south towards [[Daytona Beach]] for Spring Break, but a detour leads them into the seemingly idyllic Georgia town of Pleasant Valley, which is holding its annual "Guts and Glory Jubilee" in honor of the [[American Civil War]].

While they stay in the town, completely isolated from the outside world, they are systematically separated and killed in 
gory fashion by the town's residents. Two students manage to escape, but upon alerting the authorities they learn that "Pleasant Valley" is nothing but a [[cemetery]] - a memorial for 2001 [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] villagers who were massacred 140 years earlier by renegade Union troops during the Civil War. A plaque reveals that the town's residents will not rest until the crime has been paid back: 2001 villagers were killed, 2001 Northerners must be killed - an eye for an eye.

As the two students drive away on their [[motorcycle]], they are [[decapitation|decapitated]] by [[barbed wire]]. The heads are picked up by Hucklebilly who walks down the road and fades away.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3775">'''Al-Qatt Al-Asiri''' (also called '''''nagash'' painting''' or '''''majlis'' painting'''), is an Arabic art style. It originated in the decoration of [[majlis|''majlis'']] (the front parlour of traditional Arab homes) in the [[Asir]] province of [[Saudi Arabia]] and adjoining parts of [[Yemen]]. These wall paintings, typically in the form of a of [[mural]] or [[fresco]], present geometric designs in bright colors. Called ''nagash'' in Arabic, the wall paintings are often considered a mark of pride for a woman.&lt;ref name="Aramco"&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201304/the.majlis.painters.htm Yunis, Alia, "The Majlis Painters,"] Saudi Aramco World Magazine, July/August 2013, pages 24-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Intangible cultural heritage|Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] in 2017 as Al-Qatt Al-Asiri.&lt;ref name='UNESCO'&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Qatt Al-Asiri|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/al-qatt-al-asiri-female-traditional-interior-wall-decoration-in-asir-saudi-arabia-01261|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geometric designs and heavy lines seem to be adapted from the area’s textile and weaving patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199901/doors.of.the.kingdom.htm Maha Al Faisal and Khalid Azzam. 1999]. "Doors of the Kingdom" Saudi Aaramco World. This article appeared on pages 68-77 of the January/February 1999 print edition of Saudi Aramco World]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women’s artwork==
Women in the Asir region are traditionally responsible for plastering and painting the walls, corridors, and ceilings of their homes. A family’s wealth often is signified by the skill, color, and complexity of the paintings, with poorer homes decorated in basic straight, simple lines in red, green, yellow, and brown. Women within the same neighborhood sometimes compete to make the most vivid and extravagant designs. Several Saudi women have become famous as ''majlis'' painters, such as [[Fatima Abou Gahas]].&lt;ref name="Aramco"/&gt; Women's artwork is heavily influenced by their love for music, their view of culture and general perception of life; for example, the artwork of more conservative women is more likely to feature conservative and modest colors.

The interior walls of the home are brightly painted, employing defined patterns of lines, triangles, squares, diagonals and tree-like patterns.&lt;ref name="Aramco"/&gt;

Women from the region sometimes sell miniature ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Asiri'' houses as souvenirs and [[knickknack]]s, which are popular among Saudi city-dwellers, who find these colorful houses a source of wonder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199804/the.suqs.of.asir.htm|author=Ni'Mah Isma'il Nawwab|year=1998|title=The Suqs of 'Asir}} This article appeared on pages 2-9 of the July/August 1998 print edition of Saudi Aramco World.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airport art==
The Saudi provincial airport in [[Abha]] reflects the region's cultural heritage. Airport Director Abdul Aziz Abu Harba said that "the seating arrangement at the airport lounge has been in the form of a traditional ''majlis'' and the walls are painted in various colors reflecting the natural beauty of Asir".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/378076|author= Mishaal Al-Tamimi|title=2011 "Abha airport reflects heritage|publisher=Arab News|date=19 May 2011|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists of the World (AMFPA)''' is a for-profit international organization facilitating the sale of artwork produced by [[mouth and foot painting]] artists associated with the organization. None of the artists have proper use of their hands as a pre-condition to joining the association. It represents around 820 artists located in 76 countries, of whom 143 ( as of 2016) are full members, and receive a monthly fee from the organization from the date of their admission until their death. The other artists are students, who receive a monthly scholarship until such time as they are promoted.

The main product of the organization is [[Christmas card]]s designed by the member artists. These cards are sold every year in the months leading up to Christmas via [[direct mail]]ing in 48 countries around the world. Other products include postcards, art prints and calendars.

The parent company in [[Liechtenstein]] acquires the reproduction rights of a given painting and distributes it internationally. The original works are also sold at exhibitions held throughout the world. Works produced by the members have been shown in the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]] and at the [[European Council]] in [[Strasbourg]].

== History ==

AMFPA was founded in 1957 as the '''Vereinigung der Mund- und Fussmalenden Künstler in aller Welt, e. V. (VDMFK)''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vdmfk.com/|title=VDMFK International|publisher=VDMFK International}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Liechtenstein]]. It was styled a "self-help" organization and had the scope to further the painting skills of any mouth or foot painter, to promote their artwork and to support them financially.

=== A. Erich Stegmann ===
The first president of the association, Arnulf Erich Stegmann, was a prominent figure in the development of mouth and foot painting. Born in 1912 in Darmstadt, Germany, Stegmann lost the use of both arms from [[polio]] at the age of two. Regardless, his artistic talents were soon recognized and supported by his teachers. He was proficient with a variety of brushes and styles, using only his mouth. He was educated at the School of Higher Education for Book Trade and Graphics in [[Nuremberg]] and studied with the artists Erwin von Kormöndy and Hans Gerstacker. He made a living selling his art cards and prints at marketplaces. After the [[Second World War]] he established his own publishing company with the poignant name "Dennoch" ("Anyway").

In 1953/54 he organized the "Lodge of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists" as a type of artists' community. This developed into the international "Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists", with Stegmann elected president for life.

== Objectives ==

The association's stated objectives are:
* Find as many mouth and foot painting artists as possible.
* Safeguard and promote the interests of the mouth and foot painting artists, improve their working and living conditions, promote and improve their artistic abilities and skills, in particular, by promoting the commercial use of their work.
* Conclude and negotiate contracts with publishers in countries all over the world.
* Grant scholarships to promote the development of mouth and foot painting artists.
* Collect and make available to its members or Student Members the literature and medical or other aids owned by the Association or by others.
* Organise exhibitions by mouth and foot painting artists.
* Collect, catalogue, and administer the works created by the members.

== Organization ==

The association is run as a "democratic co-operative". Any mouth and foot painter of unimpeachable reputation living anywhere in the world can become a member of the association, provided they are 18 years of age and their works are considered artistic by the Jury who then recommends them for membership to the Managing Board.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The management procedures are governed by the statutes, which require that a Delegates Convention or General Assembly of all members must be held at least once every three years.

For electoral purposes, the Association divides the world into four regions: Europe, Africa and the Middle East; the Americas; the Far East; Australasia and Oceania. Each region deputes at least one delegate for every five members.

The managing board members and the president are elected by the members of the association. With the exception of the legal representative, every managing board member has to be a recognized mouth or foot painter.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Member organizations==
===United Kingdom===
'''The Mouth and Foot Painting Artists ''' ('''MFPA''') is the British organization for mouth and foot painters, and is a member organization of AMFPA. It was established in 1973 following legislation which required that disabled people be in charge of the business activities of an organization representing them.&lt;ref name="british"&gt;{{cite web|title=British partnership|url=https://www.mfpa.uk/about-mfpa/british-partnership/|publisher=The Mouth and Foot Painting Artists|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

Then years ago AMFPA has been the subject of several [[Exposé (journalism)|exposés]] in [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Switzerland|Swiss]], [[Sweden|Swedish]], [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[Denmark|Danish]] media, suggesting unethical behaviour within the organization. The coverage has spurred criticism from charity, consumer and handicap organizations. The criticism included:

* That AMFPA effectively poses as a [[charity organization]] although it is purely a commercial venture, in effect [[Confidence trick|conning]] charitable people out of money.&lt;ref name="TP"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lorscheid |first=Helmut |url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/19/19093/1.html |title=Alle Jahre wieder... |publisher=Telepolis |date=24 December 2004 |language=de |accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.verbrauchernews.de/artikel/0000006844.html |title=An Postkarten von Mund- und Fussmalern verdient vor allem ein Lichtensteiner Wirtschaftsunternehmen |publisher=''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]] |date=22 December 2000 |accessdate=29 July 2016 |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528060938/http://www.verbrauchernews.de/artikel/0000006844.html |archive-date=2016-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KO1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/DR1/kontant/2005/12/06150809.htm |title=Hyggeligt salgsbrev snyder |publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|Danish Broadcasting Corporation]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406093112/http://www.dr.dk/DR1/kontant/2005/12/06150809.htm |archivedate=6 April 2012 |date=6 December 2005 |language=da }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TV2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyhederne-dyn.tv2.dk/article.php/id-1631113.html |title=Hjertet på rette sted, men pengene ... |language=da |publisher=[[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV2]] |date=28 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The use of high pressure sales tactics by sending its main sales item, Christmas card packages to consumers via unsolicited [[direct mail]] with an option to pay afterwards.&lt;ref name="KO1"/&gt;
* The secrecy maintained by the company.

No claims have been made suggesting any illegal activity by AMFPA. The criticism has been centred on what is perceived as bad [[ethics]].

=== AMFPA's response to criticism ===

The AMFPA has in some news reports and court hearings responded to some of the claims, stating that AMFPA has never intentionally presented itself as a charitable organization, but instead has explicitly pointed its commercial nature out to consumers. AMFPA has also stated that 80% of the worldwide profits are distributed among the artists. AMFPA declined to present financial records to support this claim.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfje.dk/cfje/Lovbasen.nsf/ID/LB04884975?OpenDocument |title=Kendelse fra Pressenævnet i sag 2006-6-288 (Danish press ethics council ruling) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829153307/http://www.cfje.dk/cfje/Lovbasen.nsf/ID/LB04884975?OpenDocument |date=14 June 2006 |archivedate=29 August 2007 |language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMFPA stated that it never introduced pressure sales tactics but made use of direct mailing many years before competitors and charity organisations introduced similar methods.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} AMFPA sees itself as a victim of an unfair and tendentious journalistic coverage lacking of true facts and suspecting bad ethics.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Litigation ===

In June 2007 the company sued the [[Danmarks Radio|Danish Broadcasting Corporation]] and Danish daily ''[[Ekstra Bladet]]'' for [[libel]], following negative coverage during December 2005. On 10 October 2008, the [[Courts of Denmark#High Courts|High Court of Eastern Denmark]] ruled in favor of the accused journalists, stating that there was sufficient factual basis for statements like: "Behind the scenes we found a well-oiled money making machine with economic puppeteers, who are scraping in money with arms and legs"; "People think they are supporting a charity, but in reality we are looking at a money making machine"; and "...only a measly 3% is going to the mouth and foot painting artists". AMFPA did not appeal the decision.&lt;ref name="COURT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avm.dk/nyhed/visnyhed.php?nyhedsnummer=1164 |title=DR vandt sag om ytringsfrihedens grænser |publisher=avm.dk |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=29 July 2016 |language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auguste Dreyfus''' (28 June 1827 – 25 May 1897) was a French [[businessman]] who made his fortune by financing the Peruvian trade in [[guano]].{{efn|The cold [[Humboldt Current]] runs north along the coast of Peru and is rich in fish. It provides food for a huge population of seabirds. The climate is warm and dry, and bird droppings accumulate to great depth, particularly on the [[Chincha Islands]]. The guano deposits had great value as fertilizer and played a central role in the Peruvian economy for most of the 19th century.{{sfn|Hollett|2008|p=24}} }} Dreyfus joined a small textile trading firm set up by three of his elder brothers and moved to Lima, Peru to act as their local representative. He became involved in the guano trade, and in 1869 signed a major contract with the Peruvian government that gave him a monopoly over exports of Peruvian guano to Europe.
With this he controlled the largest source of Peruvian national income.

The Peruvian government let Dreyfus act as their agent in managing their existing debt and floating new loans used for railway construction. The government ran into increasing financial difficulties. These were compounded by a war with Chile between 1879 and 1883 in which they lost their key guano-producing province. A lengthy series of lawsuits followed between the creditors whose loans were secured by guano deposits and the governments of Peru and Chile. The Dreyfus trading enterprise came to an end. He retired to France, where he owned a chateau in the country and a mansion in Paris that he filled with a major collection of art.

==Early years==
[[File:Wissemourg7.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Wissembourg]], where Dreyfus was born]]
Auguste Dreyfus was born into a Jewish family in [[Wissembourg]], Bas-Rhin, on 28 June 1827.{{sfn|Riviale|1996|p=376}}
He was the tenth of twelve children of the merchant Edward Dreyfus (1788–1866) and his wife Sara Marx (1791–1865). 
He was the youngest of their seven boys.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=150}}

On 29 August 1852 Auguste's brothers Prospere, Jérome and Isidore started Dreyfus Frères &amp; Cie.{{sfn|Novak|2005|p=140}}
This was a small company in Paris trading in fabrics and other commodities.
Auguste Dreyfus joined the company in 1856.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=54}}
By 1859 Auguste Dreyfus, now residing in Peru, had become a minority partner.{{sfn|Novak|2005|p=140}}
Auguste began trading in guano, and quickly became wealthy through careful attention to the fluctuations in the global demand for the commodity.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=54}}

Prospere and Jérôme retired from the business in 1864 and Isidore in 1866.{{sfn|Bonin|2006|p=421}}
Leon Dreyfus, who had moved to Peru and made influential connections, 
became a partner on 19 January 1866 and remained associated with Auguste until 1869.{{sfn|Novak|2005|p=140}}
Auguste became respected in business circles on both sides of the Atlantic for his skill and the profitability of his enterprises.{{sfn|Bonin|2006|p=421}}

===Dreyfus contract===
The government of [[Peru]] had been exploiting their guano reserves on a consignment system, in which the state paid contractors to extract, transport and sell it on a cost-plus basis. This  encouraged corruption and inefficiency. Contractors were motivated to overstate costs and sell at low prices in order to drive up volumes. By 1868 Peru had large and growing debts. In response to growing public criticism, the government chose a new approach. {{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=53}}
On 5 July 1869 the government cancelled all consignment arrangements and granted Dreyfus Frères the exclusive right to sell up to two million tons of guano in Europe.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}} 
Dreyfus was to pay 50 ''soles''{{efn|In the 1860s a Peruvian ''sole'' was worth almost a dollar.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|p=198}} 50 soles was ₤7.6.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}} }} per ton for the guano, a considerably higher price than the government had been receiving up to then.{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=18}}

Auguste Dreyfus was backed by the [[Société Générale]] of [[Paris]].{{sfn|Bethell|2008|p=551}}
Dreyfus arranged for a partnership in which shares were issued with a nominal value of 60 million francs.  
Société Générale and the international trading house Leiden, Premsel &amp; Cie. both took 22.5 million francs while Dreyfus took 15 million.
Each of the major partners in turn distributed shares to subordinate partners.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=154}}
A private addendum to the contract stipulated that Dreyfus's choice of banker would handle Peruvian financial affairs in London.
He chose [[J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co.]], a bank of the City of London.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=154}}
Schroders would handle the bond issues of 1870 to 1872.

[[File:Nicolás de Piérola Presidente.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Nicolás de Piérola]], the finance minister who arranged the Dreyfus contract and subsequent loans]]
The royalty payments were to start in the early 1870s as the other contracts expired.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}}
In the meantime, Dreyfus would advance the government 2.4 million soles per year and 700,000 soles monthly for the first twenty months.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=54}}
The contract also included clauses through which his company would assume government debts to former guano contractors and foreign bondholders, 
charging the government 5% interest on this debt until it was paid off.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=54}}
The total debt was 21 million soles. The agreement was ratified on 17 August 1869.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}}
The Minister of Finance, who arranged the deal, was [[Nicolás de Piérola]].{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=18}}

The former contractors did not have popular support but fought the contract, which had not been open to competition.
In November 1869 the Supreme Court said the contract should be cancelled since it had stripped Peruvian citizens of their rights.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=156}}
The government rejected this ruling, saying it was for the legislature to decide.
In November 1870 the Chamber of Deputies approved the contract by 63 votes to 33, 
and the Senate ratified the decision soon after.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=156-157}}

===Government loans===

The income provided by the Dreyfus contract was absorbed in payments to an expanding civil service and armed forces.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=57}}
Rather than reduce debts or invest in urgently needed schools or irrigation projects, Pierola used the income from the contract as collateral for additional loans, 
which President [[José Balta]] used for an ambitious plan promoted by [[Henry Meiggs]] to build railways in the mountainous [[Andes]] country.{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=18}}
Dreyfus arranged to float these loans in Europe, one in 1870 for ₤12 million of 6% bonds sold at 82.5% of face value, 
and a second in 1872 of 5% bonds sold at 77.5% of face value.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=57-58}}
Peru had hoped to sell almost ₤37 million of the 1872 bonds, but investors were concerned about the country's ability to serve its soaring debts, and there were rumors that the guano supplies were running out.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}} 
Dreyfus and his associates bought most of the ₤22 million that was issued, paying just ₤13 million.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=200}}
By 1872 almost all of the government's guano revenue was going to debt interest payments, and the deficit was running at 50%.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=58}}

[[File:Mpardol.png|thumb|240px|[[Manuel Pardo]], President of Peru (1872–1876), who inherited the debt crisis]]
The public saw no return from the railway projects, and in May 1872 elected [[Manuel Pardo]] as President, a popular former mayor of Lima. An attempted coup d'état before Pardo took power did not succeed.{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=18}}
Pardo inherited a financial crisis. The best-quality and most accessible gauno had already been extracted, so prices were falling and costs rising.{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=19}}
Pardo reduced the size of the army by three-quarters and canceled two orders for battleships from Britain, 
but continued the railway construction program.{{sfn|Kaufman|Macpherson|2005|p=437}}
He allowed Dreyfus to continue with the last bond issue, which proved a failure. Only ₤8.3 million was raised, one quarter of what had been hoped.
The money mainly went to paying Dreyfus and refinancing debts.{{sfn|Cushman|2013|p=68}}

Dreyfus now began suffering from the declining quality of the remaining [[guano]] and from competition with artificial [[fertilizer]] manfuctured in Germany. In November 1873 Dreyfus announced that he no longer had enough income to service Peru's [[foreign debt]]. The government responded by withdrawing Dreyfus's permit to ship guano, and stated that bondholders of the two loans had first claim on Peruvian guano, ahead of Dreyfus.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=200}} 
The government threatened to sue Dreyfus in Europe if he failed to meet his payments on the loans. An agreement was reaching in April 1874 under which Dreyfus could export another 850,000 tons of guano, the remainder of the 2 million tons agreed in the contract, and Dreyfus would continue to service the foreign debt until 1 July 1875. Dreyfus would also advance cash to the government based on the gross value of the guano extracted.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=200}}

===Later operations===

On 1 January 1876 the Peruvian government defaulted on payments on its foreign debt.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=34-35}}
Peru reserved 100,000 tons of gauno as security for the payments they had missed.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=34}} 
In March 1876 a new contract for guano sales was agreed with the Peruvian Guano Company, formed by the London merchant bank [[Raphaels Bank|Raphael &amp; Sons]], and the Peruvians Carlos Gonzales Candamo and Arturo Heeren.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=169}}
On 31 March Peru concluded a contract with the Société Générale of Paris for the sale of guano.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=34}}
Manuel Pardo's presidency ended among growing economic problems compounded by civil unrest and a brewing crisis with Chile. He was succeeded by General [[Mariano Ignacio Prado]], to whom he had lent his support.{{sfn|Masterson|1991|p=67}}
One of Prado's first acts was to travel to London, where on 7 June 1876 he signed an agreement by which Peru sold 1,900,000 tons of guano to Raphael's consortium.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=36}}

The Dreyfus contract expired on 31 October 1876, leaving Dreyfus Brothers with about half a million tons of unsold guano.
It was expected to take until mid-1878 to clear this inventory.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=36}}
The competing Peruvian Guano Company was handicapped by terms that favored Peru, and until 1879 was not allowed to sell at competitive prices. 
Dreyfus had large stocks of higher-quality guano, and continued to dominate the global market.
The Peruvian Guano Company's bondholders tried to sue Dreyfus for a share of his guano revenue, but did not succeed.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=205}}

In February 1879 the [[War of the Pacific]] broke out between Chile and Bolivia with Peru. One of the causes was the 1875 nationalization by Peru of nitrate production facilities in [[Tarapacá Province (Peru)|Tarapacá province]], many of them owned by Chilean companies.{{sfn|Keen|Haynes|2008|p=256}} Chile quickly seized control of the main ports through which guano was exported and also Tarapacá, a key source of guano as well as of nitrates.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=205}} By late 1879 the Peruvian government still owed Dreyfus £4 million, secured by the country's remaining reserves of guano.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=146}}
In December 1879 President Prado left Peru and was replaced by Nicolás de Piérola. In January Piérola and Dreyfus agreed on a new contract under which the government recognized a debt to Dreyfus of 21 million soles, or ₤4 million, to be recovered by Dreyfus through further sales of guano. Dreyfus was to export only to markets that were not being served by the Peruvian Guano Company. The British protested against the agreement, but were not supported by the French.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=210}}

On 30 June 1880 a new agreement was made between Peru and Dreyfus to consolidate its debt. Peru would give up control of its railways for twenty five years and pay Dreyfus £3,214,388. About the same time, the Chilean government agreed to give the bondholders of the Peruvian Guano Company the right to export guano from the occupied territories.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=216}}
Chile occupied Lima in January 1881, effectively deciding the war, although a guerrilla struggle continued.{{sfn|Castillo-Feliú|2000|p=52}}
On 9 February 1882 a new agreement was made with Chile in which that country would sell one million tons of guano from Tarapacá to the highest bidder, with half the profit going to creditors of Peru whose claims were secured by the guano, including Dreyfus. Chile probably made this concession to avoid intervention by the creditor governments.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=219}}
The [[Treaty of Ancón]], signed on 20 October 1883, ended the war. Chile acquired Tarapacá permanently.{{sfn|Keen|Haynes|2008|p=256}}

[[File:Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau by Nadar.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau]], who defended Dreyfus and was named as the executor of his will]]
In the years that followed Dreyfus, the bondholders of the Peruvian Guano Company and other creditors, sometimes backed by the French or British governments, 
made conflicting claims against Chile and Peru with limited success.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=220ff}}
Dreyfus chose Waldeck-Rousseau, a prominent Republican who had been Minister of the Interior in 1884, as his advocate in his case against the Société Générale, formerly his partner.{{sfn|Bonin|2006|p=511}}{{sfn|Mayeur|2003|p=224}}

==Personal life==

===Family and friends===

Dreyfus converted to Catholicism shortly before his marriage in Lima with the Peruvian Sofia Bergman on 15 August 1862.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=150}}
His wife's brothers, Charles and Frederick Bergman, won a contract in August 1869 to build and run dock facilities in the port of [[Callao]], which they sold to the Société Générale in 1874. Sofia Bergman died in Lima in 1871.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=164}}
Dreyfus married his second wife in Lima on 8 January 1873.
Luisa González Orbegoso (1847–1924), Marquise de Villahermosa, was granddaughter of Marshal [[Luis José de Orbegoso]], one of the first presidents of the Republic of Peru.{{sfn|Conde de Premio Real}}

Two sons and two daughters were born of Dreyfus's second marriage. Louis Dreyfus (1874–1965), was successively authorized by decree of 12 August 1885 to call himself Dreyfus-Gonzalez de Andia, then in 1925 by [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]], to assume – contrary to the Spanish noble usage – the title of his mother, who died a year before, and finally, by decree of 26 July 1935, to remove Dreyfus from his name.{{sfn|Conde de Premio Real}} 
Louis married Félicie de Talleyrand-Périgord, daughter of Archambaud de Talleyrand-Périgord and Marie de Gontaut-Biron.{{sfn|DREYFUS Y GONZALES}}
[[Édouard Dreyfus Gonzalez]] (1876–1941) was a lawyer and Count of Premio Real. He wrote songs under the name Jean Dora.{{sfn|Conde de Premio Real}} 
He married Anne-Hélène de Talleyrand-Périgord, sister of Félicie.{{sfn|DREYFUS Y GONZALES}}
Emilie Dreyfus married the viscount, banker and politician [[Hervé de Lyrot]].{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=153}}{{sfn|DREYFUS Y GONZALES}}
Her sister married René de Lyrot.{{sfn|DREYFUS Y GONZALES}}

Dreyfus was described in 1886 as having great vigor and agility, despite being somewhat overweight.
He was a good friend of the President of France, [[Jules Grévy]].{{sfn|Tavernier|1886|p=300}} 
Grévy supported Dreyfus in his claims against Peru.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=204}}
Despite his conversion, Dreyfus was a target of anti-Semites such as [[Édouard Drumont]] in his 1888 polemic ''La France juive'' (Jewish France).{{sfn|Read|2012|p=33-35}}
His children would also suffer from anti-semitism.{{sfn|Wieviorka|2009|p=35}}

Dreyfus died in Paris on 25 May 1897.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=153}}

===Art collector===
[[File:Jouars-Pontchartrain Château.JPG|thumb|240px|[[Château de Pontchartrain]], which Dreyfus purchased in 1888]]
In November 1874 Dreyfus bought an imposing neo-classical hotel at 3 Rue Ruysdael.
There he accumulated an extraordinary art collection, which he inventoried in detail in 1887.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=152}}
Dreyfus showed objects in the Peru pavilion at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)]] in Paris, including furniture encrusted with pearls and objects of art. He also sent three mummies from Peru to the Paris Anthropological society in 1878.{{sfn|Riviale|1996|p=376}}
In June 1888 Dreyfus bought the domain of the [[Château de Pontchartrain]] from Count [[Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck]].{{sfn|Rounding|2004|p=282}}
In 1891 the architect [[Émile Boeswillwald]] was given the task of restoring the chateau.{{sfn|Paris et Ile-de-France 1979|p=263}}

In June 1889 Dreyfus sold 116 items from his collection, realizing 861,000 francs.{{sfn|Appletons' Annual Cyclopedia 1890|p=320}}
In June 1896 the Dreyfus-Gonzalez collection was sold at public auction in Paris, and included among other valuables four candelabra called "the sirens and garlands of leaves" (c. 1783–1784) attributed to the great bronze sculptor [[François Remond]] and coming from a series of six that were part of the furniture of the Parisian hotel of the second Duke of Praslin (1735–1791), which were acquired by the Duke of Hamilton. They were sold to Dreyfus in 1882.{{sfn|La Gazette de l'Hotel Drouot|p=62-63}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="949">'''Bond paper''' is a high quality durable [[writing paper]] similar to [[bank paper]] but having a [[Paper density|weight]] greater than 50&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The most common weights are 60&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (16&amp;nbsp;lb), 75&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (20&amp;nbsp;lb) and 90 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (24&amp;nbsp;lb). The name comes from its having originally been made for documents such as [[government bond]]s. It is now used for [[letterhead]]s and other [[stationery]] and as paper for electronic [[Computer printer|printers]]. Widely employed for graphic work involving pencil, pen and felt-tip marker, bond paper can sometimes contain rag fibre pulp, which produces a stronger, though rougher, sheet of paper.

'''Campeche chair''', also known as a "plantation chair," is a type of lounge chair popular in [[Latin America]], the [[Caribbean]], and the [[Southern United States|American South]]. Its name comes from the [[Campeche]] region of [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatán Peninsula]], which manufactured and exported the chairs in the 18th and 19th centuries. In Great Britain it is called an "X-frame chair," which gives a clue to its structure: two X-shaped sides joined by horizontal rails, with a sling back and seat of leather, cane or wooden slats. Campeches often have attached arms, and sometimes are made into rocking chairs.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] owned at least two "Campeachy" armchairs at [[Monticello]],&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Randolph Trist (Jefferson's granddaughter) to her sister Ellen Randolph Coolidge, June 27, 1825, ''Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Retirement Series Digital Library'', University of Virginia, Charlottesville. Quoted in Gontar, ''Antiques''.&lt;/ref&gt; and had more copied by enslaved woodworker [[John Hemings]].&lt;ref&gt;The gift shop at Monticello sells replicas of a Jefferson "Campeachy."[http://www.monticelloshop.org/111006.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Madison]] owned a Mexican-made Campeche armchair at his plantation [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]], which was described as his "favorite seat."&lt;ref&gt;"Madison's Campeche chair returns to Montpelier," ''Montpelier Staff's blog'', 2011.[http://www.montpelier.org/blog/madison%E2%80%99s-campeche-chair-returns-montpelier]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carltheater''' was a [[theatre]] in [[Vienna]]. It was in the suburbs in [[Leopoldstadt]] at Praterstraße 31 (at that time called Jägerzeile).

It was the successor to the [[Theater in der Leopoldstadt|Leopoldstädter Theater]]. After a series of financial difficulties, that theater had been sold in 1838 to the director, Carl Carl, who continued to run it in parallel to his [[Theater an der Wien]] until 1845. Two years later, the building was partially demolished and rebuilt following the plans of architects [[August Sicard von Sicardsburg]] and [[Eduard van der Nüll]], who would later design the [[Vienna State Opera]].

The theatre was opened under the name ''Carltheater'' in the same year, 1847. Many {{Interlanguage link multi|Alt-Wiener Volkstheater|de}} pieces by [[Johann Nestroy|Johann Nepomuk Nestroy]] premiered here; between 1854 and 1860, Nestroy was the director of the theatre. In subsequent years, many well-known Viennese playwrights wrote pieces for the Carltheater and reinforced its reputation as the favoured opera house for Viennese folk-pieces and [[operetta]]s.

After a rapid changeover of directors in the 20th century, the theatre became unprofitable, and was finally closed in 1929.

In 1944, the auditorium of the theatre was almost entirely destroyed in a bomb attack. The artistically valuable facade was, however, still remarkably intact after the war. In 1951 it was demolished, with neighbouring building which had not been damaged in the war. Nowadays, the site is host to the "Galaxy"-building. A few years ago there was a plaque in Praterstraße, marking the former location of the theatre, but this is gone too now.

'''The Crouse Library for Publishing Arts''' contains a comprehensive collection of books, periodicals, reports, and other materials on the bookselling and publishing industries.  Scholars have called it "an important [collection] that aids our understanding of the book trade as a profession."

Prior to  1989, much of the collection was housed in the Graduate Library of the City University of New York.  Currently, the collection is housed at the [[New York Center for Independent Publishing]], which is, itself, a part of the venerable General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York.

The Library's holdings include approximately 3,000 volumes on all aspects of the industry. Contained in the collection are published works (many out-of-print) on such topics as bookselling; book design and production; trade, scholarly and children's book publishing; 
author/publisher relations; [[book collecting]]; censorship; and a wealth of biographies of luminaries of the book trade.

The Library was endowed by [[William H. Crouse]], a successful technical writer for General Motors and McGraw-Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/06/books/publishing-a-gold-mine-for-technical-writers.html|title=PUBLISHING: A GOLD MINE FOR TECHNICAL WRITERS|last=Mcdowell|first=Edwin|date=1983-05-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10165">The '''Design Piracy Prohibition Act''', {{USBill|110|H.R.|2033}}, {{USBill|110|S.|1957}}, and {{USBill|111|H.R.|2196}}, were [[bill (law)|bills]] of the same name introduced in the [[United States Congress]] that would have amended [[Title 17 of the United States Code]] to provide ''[[sui generis]]'' protection to [[fashion design]]s for a period of three years.  The Acts would have extend protection to "the appearance as a whole of an article of apparel, including its ornamentation," with "apparel" defined to include "men's, women's, or children's clothing, including undergarments, outerwear, gloves, footwear, and headgear;" "handbags, purses, and tote bags;" belts, and eyeglass frames.  In order to receive the three-year term of protection, the designer would be required to [[copyright registration|register]] with the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] within three months of going public with the design.

==H.R. 2511, 112th Congress==
H.R. 2511 was introduced July 13, 2011 by Representative Robert Goodlatte [R-VA6] with thirteen co-sponsors. On August 25, 2011, the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] referred the Bill to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property|U.S. House Subcomittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property]].
http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-2511

==H.R. 2033, 110th Congress==
H.R. 2033 was introduced April 25, 2007 by Representative [[Bill Delahunt]] with fourteen co-sponsors. On May 4, 2007 the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] referred the Bill to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property|U.S. House Subcomittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property]]. A hearing was held February 14, 2008, but the bill never made it out of the subcommittee.

==S. 1957, 110th Congress==
S. 1957 was introduced on August 2, 2007, in [[Washington, D.C.]] by Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY) with ten co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary but progressed no further.

==H.R. 2196, 111th Congress==
H.R. 2196 was introduced on April 30, 2009, by Representative Delahunt and twenty-three co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary on the same day and then stalled in committee.

==Current Status of Fashion Design Protection==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Currently, fashion may only be protected by [[copyright]] to the extent that its shape is non-utilitarian enough to qualify as a creative "sculpture," or to the extent that a design, pattern, or image on the clothing qualifies as "pictorial" or "graphic." While current laws against [[counterfeit goods]] do provide some protection for designers, this is so only when the trademark is used and not when merely the design is copied under a different label. In addition, fashion may be protected by design patents if the requirements for patentability are met.  To be patentable an ornamental design must be new, original and non-obvious.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office website (www.uspto.gov) has a searchable database of patents, and includes patents on apparel in class D2, carrying articles in class D3, and eyeglass frames in class D16. Technological advances to the means of textile and garment production, as well as increases in the number of distribution channels and the availability of cheap labor in emerging economies have enabled those who would copy these designs to do so quickly and inexpensively. Legislation targeting design piracy has already been enacted in [[Europe]], [[India]], and [[Japan]].

==Criticism==
Critics claim that, contrary to the bill's claims, the bill will actually harm independent [[fashion designer]]s. The majority of independent designers do not have the litigation funds to effectively challenge big business should they be accused of [[copyright infringement]]. Furthermore, because distributors of accused designs can be penalized as well as the designer, distributors of clothing will become very wary of new designs unless the designer has adequate funds, influence, and power to hire skilled and effective lawyers. Pattern companies frequently utilize prevailing trends; so they too are vulnerable. Because of the legal risks of producing fashion patterns, fewer people will sew their own clothing, and fabric and sewing stores will suffer losses as well. As evidence of the bill's hypocrisy, critics point to how one of the most vocal supporters of the bill, [[Diane von Fürstenberg]], was recently caught copying and distributing a piece of clothing originally designed by an independent Canadian designer. Critics also argue that the industry is already thriving commercially and encourages innovation.  They point attention to the concept that originality in fashion design is too insubstantial for copyright law to distinguish protected elements from non-protected elements, and that extending copyright protection would stifle independent designers while giving powerful, big-business fashion houses a near-[[monopoly]].

==Related Bills==

===H.R. 5055, 109th Congress: To Amend Title 17, United States Code, to Provide Protection for Fashion Design===
H.R. 5055 was introduced March 30, 2006 by Representative [[Robert W. Goodlatte]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Virginia|Va.]]), with six co-sponsors from both parties. The bill was referred by the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property|U.S. House Subcomittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property]].

The subcommittee held a hearing on the bill on July 27, 2006, at which there was disagreement among legal experts as well as representatives of the fashion industry as to whether there was a need for copyright protection.  Proponents of the Act claimed that new technology threatened American designers' ability to compete with the products of lower-cost countries, because the distribution of images of new designs and the automation of copying and manufacturing could occur within hours.  They additionally pointed out that the United States was the exception among western nations in failing to protect designs.

===S. 3728, 111th Congress: Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act===
S.3728 was introduced on August 5, 2010, by Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] with ten co-sponsors. On December 1, 2010, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary voted unanimously for the bill to proceed to the Senate floor. This is the furthest that any of the design bills has progressed since 2006.

Under the IDPPPA, a copy of a design would have infringed if it was found to be "substantially identical" to the original work with little to no changes to set that design apart. Penalties for false representation would have been increased from $500 to $5,000 and from $1,000 to $10,000. "Apparel" items that would be protected by this Act include women's, men's, and children's clothing as well as luggage, handbags, wallets and eyeglass frames. A "fashion design" under the IDPPPA would be defined as an entire article of apparel including its embellishment and also includes elements of the original apparel that are the creative work of the original designer and are unique.

Supporters argue that this act would create more protection for fashion designers. Opponents have argued that the bill would "bring more lawyers into every step of the design process," outlaw "inspiration and creativity," prevent "unrestricted use of works in the public domain," and "slow down the fast-paced design process."[http://designer-entrepreneurs.com/blog/illustrations/DPPA_ABadPlanforAmericasDesigners.pdf] Some designers have supported the IDPPPA for protecting their current and future fashion designs. For example, Kurt Courtney of the AAFA has praised the bill as a "great compromise and a product of hard work," but added that its effects will largely be seen in court cases involving the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[BNA's Patent, Trademark &amp; Copyright Journal, December 3, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===S. 3523, 112th Congress: Innovative Design Protection Act===

S.3523 was introduced on September 10, 2012, by Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] with ten co-sponsors. On September 20, 2012, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary voted for the bill to proceed to the Senate floor without amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:2:./temp/~bdJNnQ::|/home/LegislativeData.php?n=BSS;c=112  "Bill Summary &amp; Status, 112th Congress (2011-12), S. 3523"], [[THOMAS]].

'''"Do not buy Russian goods!"''' ({{lang-uk|«Не купуй російське!»}} [ne kupuy ros'iys'ke], {{lang-ru|Не покупай российское!}}) or '''"Boycott Russian goods!"''' ({{lang-uk|«Бойкотуй російське!»}} [boykotuy ros'iys'ke]) is a [[nonviolent resistance]] campaign to [[boycott]] [[Russia]]n [[commerce]] in [[Ukraine]]. The [[protest]] started on August 14, 2013 as a reaction to a [[Export blockade of Ukraine by Russia|Russian Federation trade embargo against Ukraine]]. It was organized by [[Vidsich]] on [[social media]].&lt;ref name=UW130814/&gt; The campaign expanded to mass distribution of leaflets, posters, and stickers in over 45 cities and towns. Having faded by the beginning of the [[Euromaidan]] demonstrations in November 2013, it was renewed on March 2, 2014, during the [[2014 Crimean crisis|Crimean crisis]] and the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]].

According to activists, the campaign began as a response to a series of [[Economic warfare|economic wars]] launched by Russia against Ukraine, including the "Meat War", the "Cheese War", and the "Chocolate War."&lt;ref name=UW130814/&gt; On August 14, 2013, the [[Federal Customs Service of Russia]] listed all Ukrainian [[exporters]] as companies "at risk", resulting in a [[blockade]] of Ukrainian products [[import]]ed to Russia.&lt;ref name=AP130815/&gt; A backup developed at [[customs]] involving hundreds of truckloads and railcars of Ukrainian goods.&lt;ref name=Hrom130815/&gt;

===In Ukraine===
On August 22, 2013, activists held a protest near the [[Presidential Administration of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=RS130822/&gt;&lt;ref name=PK130822/&gt;&lt;ref name=PRUA130822/&gt; The campaign continued with a mass distribution of leaflets, posters and stickers in more than 45 cities and towns in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=podrob130912/&gt;&lt;ref name=MUA130926/&gt; [[Caricature]]s of Russian [[Matryoshka doll]]s have been used in the campaign.&lt;ref name=SMH140726/&gt; The campaign began to decline with the beginning of [[Euromaidan]].

On March 2, 2014, activists used [[social networks]] to announce the renewal of the boycott on any goods and services that benefit Russian companies. The intention was to keep Ukrainian money from going to Russia where it may be used to support the Russian military.&lt;ref name=DW140404/&gt; The boycott was launched in response to the [[2014 Crimean crisis|Crimean crisis]] and the [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=810051049009428&amp;set=a.705471472800720.1073741828.702243916456809&amp;type=1&amp;stream_ref=10 Бойкотуємо товари і бізнес окупантів!

In March 2014, activists began organizing [[flash mob]]s in supermarkets to urge customers not to buy Russian goods&lt;ref name=Vidsich140324/&gt;&lt;ref name=CHV140410/&gt;&lt;ref name=GL140323/&gt; and to boycott Russian [[gas stations]],&lt;ref name=34UA140501/&gt;&lt;ref name=RS140417/&gt;&lt;ref name=UW140425/&gt;&lt;ref name=PIK140516/&gt; banks,&lt;ref name=UW140424/&gt; and concerts.&lt;ref name=TSN140603/&gt; In April 2014, some [[movie theater]]s in [[Kiev]], [[Lviv]], and [[Odessa]] began shunning Russian films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://censor.net.ua/news/280504/nekotorye_kinoteatry_kieva_lvova_i_odessy_obyavili_boyikot_rossiyiskoyi_kinoproduktsii Некоторые кинотеатры Киева, Львова и Одессы объявили бойкот российской кинопродукции] {{Ref-ru|}}.

In the end of August 2014 activists have started a campaign "[[Boycott Russian Films]]" against Russian movies and serials on Ukrainian media space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiosvoboda.org/media/video/26566903.html «Не пустимо в хату російську вату»&amp;nbsp;— театралізована акція під Держкіно] {{Ref-uk|}}.

By April 2014, some Russian manufacturers changed their [[barcodes]] from Russian to Ukrainian.&lt;ref name=Fakty140409/&gt; Titled ''Boycott Invaders'', an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]] was developed to identify products from Russia, including those disguising their origin.&lt;ref name=SMH140726/&gt;&lt;ref name=DW140404/&gt;&lt;ref name=LIN140403/&gt;

===International spread===
Beginning in March 2014, the boycott spread to [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref name=reut140304/&gt;

==Results==
Sales of Russian goods in Ukraine decreased by 35-50% in the spring of 2014.&lt;ref name=TSN140326/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKRO140518/&gt; In May 2014, Ukrainian supermarkets began to abandon the procurement of Russian goods. Delivery of goods from Russia fell by a third.&lt;ref name=FN140514/&gt;

In April 2014 it was reported that producers from Russian Federation are changing Russian barcodes with [[barcode]]s of other countries.&lt;ref name="Fakty_09.04.2014"&gt;[http://fakty.ictv.ua/ua/index/read-news/id/1511226 Російська окупація українських товарів: як кокошник відрізнити від дівочого вінка (відео)] {{Ref-uk|}}.

From January to May 2014, according to [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] ratings, banks with Russian capital in Ukraine lost more than 50% of deposits.&lt;ref name=PRUA140714/&gt;

According to comparison test of Russian [[TV series]] watching ratings in Ukraine for 2013 (sample by [[GfK]]) and for 2014 (sample by [[Nielsen N.V.|Nielsen]]), total ratings dropped by a third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forbes.ua/ua/business/1370808-rosijski-seriali-ekonomichna-zbroya-upovilnenoyi-diyi Російські серіали: економічна зброя уповільненої дії] {{Ref-uk|}}. [[Forbes]]. 13.05.2014&lt;/ref&gt;

As of mid of May 2014 it is known that Ukrainian supermarkets have started to massively abandon purchases of Russian goods. Supply amounts from Russian Federation decreased by a third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facenews.ua/articles/2014/199031/ Бойкот российских товаров дал результат: поставки РФ упали на треть] {{Ref-ru|}}. facenews. 14.05.2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
According to "[[Taylor Nelson Sofres]]" (TNS) Internet research in Ukraine, in March–April 2014 — 52% of Ukrainians are positive or "rather positive" about the boycott of Russian products. According to the survey, 39% of Ukrainians are involved into the boycott.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/05/15/7025437/ Понад третина українців бойкотують російські товари] {{Ref-uk|}}. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]. 15.05.2014&lt;/ref&gt; Further survey campaign revealed that from July to August 2014, support of Russian products boycott increased from 52% to 57%. The number of people who are personally taking part in boycott of Russian products increased from 40% to 46%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/08/18/7035146/ Опитування: серед українців зростає підтримка АТО і бойкоту російських товарів] {{Ref-uk|}}. Ukrayinska Pravda. 18.08.2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to data reported by [[1+1 (channel)#Programming and current schedule|TSN]], in September 2014, 50% of Ukrainians joined Russian products boycott.&lt;ref name="TSN_20.09.2014"&gt;[http://tsn.ua/video/video-novini/vzhe-piv-roku-ukrayinci-boykotuyut-rosiyski-tovari.html?type=1551 Вже пів року українці бойкотують російські товари] {{Ref-uk|}}. TSN. [[1+1 (channel)|1+1]]. 20.09.2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Economist [[Andriy Novak (economist)|Andriy Novak]] made a statement that the Russian products boycott in March 2014 has caused no more than a few tens of million dollars' loss to the Russian economy. In his opinion, the more effective way of fighting Russian economy is "striking at a painful area – "[[Gazprom]]"".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ua.112.ua/ekonomika/boykot-rosiyskih-tovariv-ne-ye-efektivnoyu-miroyu-udar-treba-nanositi-po-gazpromu-ekspert-41609.html Бойкот російських товарів не є ефективною мірою, удар треба наносити по «Газпрому»&amp;nbsp;— експерт] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906020435/http://ua.112.ua/ekonomika/boykot-rosiyskih-tovariv-ne-ye-efektivnoyu-miroyu-udar-treba-nanositi-po-gazpromu-ekspert-41609.html |date=September 6, 2014 }} {{uk icon}}. 112 Ukraine. 28.03.2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a boycott was supported by [[Fozzy Group]], a Ukrainian group of companies that owns and manages retail stores, but was not supported by Ukrainian representative offices of "[[Auchan]] Ukraine" and "[[Metro Cash and Carry]]" retail groups. The reason was explained as a part of their apolitical vision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zaxid.net/news/showNews.do?ashan_ta_metro_ne_pidtrimali_boykot_rosiyskih_tovariv&amp;objectId=1307261 «Ашан» та «Метро» не підтримали бойкот російських товарів] {{uk icon}}. zaxid.net. 24.04.2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Andriy Dlihach, "Advanter Group" CEO, urged not to ban Russian products and to concentrate on buying Ukrainian ones instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forbes.ua/ua/opinions/1368512-bojkot-rosijskih-tovariv-za-i-proti Бойкот російських товарів: за і проти]. [[Forbes]]. 01.04.2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukrainian and Russian-speaking blogger Danylo Vakhovskyi said that he is consciously using Russian internet services and will continue to do so, because it is a way to support "the creation of a favorable environment for entrepreneurship" in Russia. Although it is "not patriotic, but to support entrepreneurs "with ruble", it is to give opportunity for the development of new projects, that is changing world for the better". The blogger also presented some examples of such projects, including these websites: [[QIWI]], [[Ostrovok.ru]] and [[Kaspersky Anti-Virus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ain.ua/2014/03/12/515658 Почему я не поддерживаю бойкот российских товаров и сервисов] {{ru icon}}. ain. 12.03.2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EPR Architects''' is a London-based architectural practice that originally started business under the names of its founders '''Elsom Pack &amp; Roberts'''. It is known for commercial, residential and hotel projects.

[[Cecil Elsom]] [[CBE]] (17 January 1912 – 3 April 2006) founded the practice in London  in 1947 with William Pack and Alan Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U14933 ELSOM, Cecil Harry’, Who Was Who, A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007], accessed 18 Dec 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to Elsom's obituary in ''The Times'': "[He was an] Architect who appreciated classical design and restoration but also provided London with admirable postwar buildings."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', April 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Projects such as the [[International style (architecture)|international style]] Eastbourne Terrace office scheme became the trademark style in the practice's early years.

The practice changed its name to EPR Partnership in the eighties, and then EPR Architects in 1988. The company is based in [[Millbank]], London, previously being based in [[Pimlico]].  The practice was listed in AJ100 for 2013 at position 17 out of the top 100 architectural practices. The company sponsors the New London Architecture centre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newlondonarchitecture.org/organisation.php?id=100 New London Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; and UK Green Building Council's Pinpoint.&lt;ref&gt;http://pinpoint.ukgbc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Life Stories]] conducted an oral history interview (C467/10) with Cecil Elsom in 1997 for its Architects Lives' collection held by the British Library.&lt;ref name=oralhistory&gt;[http://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Architects-Lives/021M-C0467X0010XX-0001V0 National Life Stories, 'Elsom, Cecil (1 of 10) National Life Stories Collection: Architects' Lives', The British Library Board, 1997].

'''Eve/Livia''' is a fictional character created by [[Robert Tapert]] for the popular TV series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]''. She is portrayed by [[Adrienne Wilkinson]] as an adult and as a baby by infant actors. She is loosely based on [[Livia Drusilla]] who was the wife of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]].

==Character history==
Eve is the daughter of [[Xena]] and younger sister of [[Solan (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Solan]], born of a miraculous conception after Xena and [[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]] encounter a deity called the ''God of Light''.&lt;ref name="fallen angel"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Fallen Angel|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Xena chooses to save her former enemy, [[Callisto (Xena)|Callisto]], from eternal suffering, the redeemed spirit of Callisto allows her to conceive a child, who is then selected to be her [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name="fallen angel"/&gt;

Before her birth, Xena's unborn daughter is prophesied by [[Moirai|the Fates]] to become the Bringer of Twilight, the human who will bring about the end of the rule of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]].&lt;ref name="god fearing"&gt;{{cite episode|title=God Fearing Child|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeus]] attempts to kill Xena and her child before this happens, but is thwarted by his son [[Heracles|Hercules]], who kills him with a rib of [[Cronus]].&lt;ref name="god fearing"/&gt; Xena delivers the baby with Gabrielle's help in the shade of a tree, moments after Zeus's demise. Xena names the girl Eve, a name that her deceased son [[Solan (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Solan]] suggested upon seeing him in the [[Greek underworld|underworld]].&lt;ref name="god fearing"/&gt; Meanwhile, [[Athena]] becomes the leader of the Olympian gods, and they continue their ceaseless persecution of the infant Eve. Driven to desperation, Xena and Gabrielle fake their own deaths, and that of Eve, by staging a fatal crash, then taking a sleeping draught&lt;ref name="death in the eye"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Looking Death in the Eye|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a manner similar to the ploy in [[Romeo and Juliet]]. They intend to awaken shortly afterwards, but the plan goes awry when [[Ares (Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess)|Ares]], believing them to be dead, buries Xena and Gabrielle in an [[ice cave]] on [[Mount Etna]] as great warriors and leaves Xena's [[sword]] and [[chakram]]. Eve remains in the custody of Xena's friend [[Augustus|Octavius]], who proceeds to take her to Rome and sends her to the [[Roman province|provinces]] to be educated.&lt;ref name="death in the eye"/&gt;

Twenty-five years later, Xena and Gabrielle awaken to discover that Octavius has become the [[Roman Emperor]] Augustus Caesar, and Eve is now a brutal warrior known as ''[[Livia]]'', the Champion of Rome.&lt;ref name="Livia"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Livia|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the protégée and lover of Ares, but is intending to marry Augustus and thus become the empress. Xena sets about trying to stop her daughter from massacring innocent people, and in the process inadvertently exposes Livia's identity to the gods, who resume their persecution of her as the Bringer of Twilight.&lt;ref name="Livia"/&gt; She feels conflicted when Eve murders Xena's old friend [[Joxer]].

Livia is reformed when [[Eli (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Eli]]'s spirit shows her various moments of Xena taking care of her when she was a baby, and learns that her mother truly did care for her.&lt;ref name="Eve"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Eve|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformed Livia once again takes on the name of Eve, and intends to become the Messenger of Eli, who taught pacifism and independence from the Olympian gods. While Eve is initiated into the sect of Eli, the God of Eli gives Xena the power to kill gods as long as Eve is alive.&lt;ref name="Motherhood"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Motherhood|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development causes the Olympians to redouble their efforts to kill Xena and her daughter, bringing about their own demise when Xena goes up against them with her newly acquired power. Ares and [[Aphrodite (Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess)|Aphrodite]] survive, having remained neutral during the ordeal. However, Ares gives up his powers and [[immortality]] to save Eve and Gabrielle.&lt;ref name="Motherhood"/&gt;

After the Twilight of the Gods, Eve travelled with Xena and Gabrielle. As such, she appears in the first four episodes of season six. According to an interview with Adrienne Wilkinson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Final Chakram Throw|url=http://www.bitch-of-rome.com/interviews/finalchakram.html|publisher=Bitch of Rome}}{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the episode "Coming Home" took place a year after the events in "Motherhood".

After "Who's Gurkhan?" Eve apparently returned to Rome, though no explanation was provided for her absence. In fact, while Xena seemed to know where Eve was, Gabrielle didn't, as seen in "The God You Know" where Gabrielle seems surprised to learn Eve is in Rome.

Eve challenges the emperor, [[Caligula]], in "The God You Know" in regards to his slaughter of the Elijans. She is nearly killed by [[Caligula]], but Xena arrives in time to defeat him and save Eve.

Eve is seen briefly in "You Are There" being interviewed by a [[news reporter]] Nigel.

Eve's final appearance in the series was in the episode "Path of Vengeance" in which she returns to the land of [[Varia (Xena)|Varia]]'s [[tribe]] of [[Amazons]] in order to atone for her attack on them six years prior. Varia, now leading the multiple Amazon tribes that have gathered from around the known world, captures Eve in order to make her stand trial. Marga had apparently banished Eve after "Coming Home" with the threat of death if she returned. Varia, having lost her little sister at Livia's hand during the attack on her village, is after Eve's life.

It is revealed in this episode, that the Amazons she captured as slaves (as stated in "Coming Home"), she had tossed overboard with their [[shackles]] still on when she was unable to sell them to Gurkhan.

Gabrielle challenges Varia for leadership of the Amazons in order to save Eve's life when she is found guilty, but loses. Xena challenges Varia to a fight before she can execute Eve, and in doing so, she shows Varia that she has become like Livia, which leads Varia to stop her actions, and pardon Eve (stating Livia is dead).

At the end of the episode, Eve parts ways with Xena and Gabrielle, heading to [[China ]]a to continue to spread the message of Eli. Xena offers to go with her, but Eve states she needs to do it on her own, and departs.

There is a hint of Eve having children as stated in the episode "The Xena Scrolls", Professor Pappas and Melinda Pappas to be descendants of Xena in the 1940s, as she is Xena's only living offspring.

Livia made two appearances in season six. One was as a vision seen by Eve, caused by the king of [[Hell]], [[Mephistopheles]], in order to torment Eve, hoping to get her to spill her blood in order to release him into the world in the episode " The Haunting of [[Amphipolis]]." Livia was also seen in flashbacks in " Path of Vengeance" when she attacked Varia's tribe.

==Skills and Abilities==
Eve possesses excellent combat prowess; comprehensively trained by [[Ares (Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess)|Ares]] from early childhood to fight in his name. (Hand-to-hand combat, all sorts of weapons but mostly swords) She is established as an extremely dangerous individual, and is more than capable of taking a stand against even the most skilled and dangerous of opponents, such as the [[Ares (Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess)|God of War]] and her [[Xena|mother]].

'''Chakram Skills: ''' In the episode "Eve", she was able to stop the Chakram when Xena threw it at her by  cutting it into two pieces. In the next episode "Motherhood", Eve caught the Chakram.

'''Acrobatic Skills: ''' Aside from other acrobatic skills almost all well-trained warriors have in the show, Eve (Livia) has her own ''trademark'' moves: in the episode "Coming Home" as well as in the episode "Path of Vengeance", Eve (Livia) made a flip that only '''she''' knew how to do; this was revealed by Varia: '"I've seen only one warrior do that move..."' and which actually helped her to recognize the woman as being the former Livia—the Champion of Rome.

'''Commander: ''' Being the former commander of the Roman Legions, Eve (Livia) holds her previously acquired knowledge of political and historical facts.

'''Heavenly Abilities:''' After Eve was initialized as the Messenger of the God of Light, she received a number of abilities that are channelled from Heaven. In the episodes "The Haunting of Amphipolis" and "Heart of Darkness", Eve was shown casting evil spirits back to Hell and healing a human who was taken by demons.

'''Fire art''' is a piece of art that uses active [[Fire|flames]] as an essential part of the piece. The piece may either use flame effects as part of a sculpture, or be a choreographed performance of fire effects as the piece burns; the latter being almost a type of [[performance art]]. 

Fire can be a compelling medium for artists and viewers. It has a direct effect on its surroundings, consuming materials and giving heat and light. It is constantly moving and can appear to be alive. There is also the inherent perceived danger of fire.

Fire artists use various [[fuel]]s and colorants to achieve desired effects. The choice of fuel is largely dependent on the effects desired. In large stationary pieces, [[propane]] gas is a popular fuel. Gas escaping from its container can be set alight. Different plumbing, pressures, nozzles alter the nature of the flames. Controlling how the propane mixes with the oxygen in the air is important. 

Liquid fuels like [[alcohol]], [[methanol]], [[kerosene]], mixes of kerosene and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], and others, can produce spectacular results. Extra precautions must be taken with liquids because they fall and splash, while gasses usually dissipate. 

Most colorants are solids ground into a powder. As the powder is heated, it begins to [[oxidize]] and burns a color particular to the chemical used. Some colorants can be dissolved in alcohol or water or other liquids to facilitate their dispersion in the fire. Some colorants are toxic and should not be used in proximity to people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3232">[[File:Henryk Barczyński - Maski.jpg|thumb|''The Masks'', painting by Henryk Barczyński]]

'''Henoch (Henryk) Barczyński''' (born December 15, 1896 in [[Łódź]] - d. March 14, 1941 (?) in [[Tomaszów Mazowiecki]]) was a Polish painter of Jewish descent, graphic artist, illustrator.

==Biography==
Henoch Barczyński was a son of Szmul Barczyński, tailor, and Sara née Parzęczewska. In years 1912-14 he studied graphics in Jakub Katsenbogen's drawing school in Lodz. Later he was a pupil of [[Enrico Glicenstein|Henryk Glicenstein]] in Warsaw. In years 1919-1926 he studied painting at the Academy of Fine Art in Dresden. He was connected with the artistic group "Jung Jidysz" in Łódź. In 1925 he won the first prize for a propaganda poster during the International Red Cross Contest. He visited France, Spain and Italy. He spend some months in [[Paris]] and [[Prague]]. In years 1927-33 he lived in [[Berlin]]. In 1933 he returned to Łódź (Poland). In 1933-39 he lived in his ''Heimatstadt''.

In September 1939 he settled in Tomaszów Mazowiecki. In this town he created an artistic circle. He is mentioned six times in Lutek Orenbach's ''Letters from the Tomaszów Ghetto''. The last mention is dated (December 25, 1940).

He was killed by the Nazis in 1941 (probably 14 March) in Tomaszów Mazowiecki.

== Artistic works ==
Barczyński's artistic works were influenced by [[Marc Chagall]] and [[Oskar Kokoschka]], and motivated by the everyday life of the Polish Jews. He painted in water colors, practiced copper plate engraving and etching. His art-works were exhibited in Berlin, [[Dresden]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[New York City]] and Łódź.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1589">'''Illyrian fibulae''' or brooches were widely used by [[Illyrians]] and were very common in [[Illyria]]. Some types of [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]] are one of the few objects that all of the Illyrians used and some are even used to declare the distribution of Illyrian people. Illyrians loved ornaments, and on festive occasions their womenfolk would appear heavily draped with all manner of jewelley. Several varieties of fibulae have a distinctive evolution in Ilyria, notable the [[Spectacle brooch]] of two concentrically wound spirals attached to the pin. The Glasinac fibula was a variant of the simple bow-fibula which is common among many Illyrians. Other forms which appear in the early [[Iron Age]] include those and with bosses on the arch, animal-shaped brooches, serpent-shaped  and plate-brooches, the last being distinctively [[Liburnian]].

A significant later import was the heavy brooch with a large arch and long arm named from the site of [[Certosa di Bologna|Certosa]] near [[Bologna]]. Another distinctive brooch, often made in silver and with a wide arch in the form of open petals, is named from the fine examples found at Strpci on the [[Drina]] river near Gorazde. This type seems to have been popular among the southern Illyrians and is believed to be modeled on Greek forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkes|first=John J.|title=The Illyrians|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1995|isbn=0-631-19807-5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irworobongdo''' is a [[Korea]]n [[folding screen]] with a highly stylized [[landscape painting]] of a [[sun]] and [[moon]], five peaks which always was set behind [[Phoenix Throne|''Eojwa'']], the king’s royal [[throne]] during the [[Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="KTO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=259914 |title=The National Palace Museum of Korea |publisher=[[Korea Tourism Organization]] |accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D61038F936A25753C1A965958260 |title=Sampling of Treasures From 18th-Century Korea |author=Holland Cotter |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=October 15, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It literally means ''"Painting of the Sun, Moon and the Five Peaks"'' and is also called "Irwoldo" or "Irwolgonryundo". The sun and moon symbolize the king and queen while the five peaks denotes a mythical place. The screen serves to display the majesty of the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] royal court.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=257096&amp;v=43 |script-title=ko:일월곤륜도 (日月崑崙圖)|publisher=[[Empas]] / [[EncyKorea]] |language=Korean |accessdate=2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the image==
The scene depicts a burning red sun, a full moon, five craggy peaks, and two fast-flowing streams with [[Waterfall|cascades]], all flanked by a pair of conifers. The brilliant colours &amp;mdash; known as tang-chae (Chinese colours) &amp;mdash; were fixed with either animal or fish glue, rendering the screens brilliant and waterfast.&lt;ref name="HKMJ 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/22/2200381.pdf |title=Sun, moon, and five peaks |author=Chadwick A. |journal=Hong Kong Medical Journal |date=June 1998 |volume= 4 |issue=2 |pages=114&amp;ndash;115}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[New York Times]] critic Holland Cotter has described the screen's solid, saturated colors and robust forms as being regular as "textile patterns", and noted that these screens have "an archaic, hieratic look unlike Chinese or Japanese painting of the time." &lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

==Symbolic significance==
[[Image:Gojong-King.of.the.Korean.Empire-1903.jpg|thumb|left|The Irworobongdo on a portrait of Gojong, king of Joseon Dynasty]]
There are no existing documents from an early period to explain the original [[iconography]] of the Five Peaks. Chadwick reports the findings of Dr. Yi Song-mi, Professor of Art History at the [[Academy of Korean Studies]] in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref name="Yi Seong-mi"&gt;Yi Seong-mi, The screen of the Five Peaks of the Choson dynasty. Oriental Art 1996/1997;XLII/4:13&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt; He has suggested that these screens were one of the most important elements in the throne hall, and that this formalized landscape illustrates the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] political [[cosmology]].&lt;ref name="HKMJ"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/22/2200175.pdf |title=Sun, moon, and Immortal Peaches |author=Chadwick A. |journal=Hong Kong Medical Journal |date=September 1996 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=234&amp;ndash;235}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "almost" red sun represents the king as the yang, the positive male principle, while the white moon represents the queen as the yin, the negative female principle. These two principles make the universe work.

An alternative explanation is that the screen might represent the blessing of Korea by Heaven, symbolized by the sun and moon in balance. When the king sat in front of this screen, he appeared to be at the pivotal point from which all force emanated and to which all returned. Thus, imbued with sacred power, the screen manifests a political cosmology as evidence of Heaven's favour, mandate, and continued protection of the ruler.&lt;ref name="HKMJ 1998"/&gt;

==History of the screens==
Chadwick (1998)&lt;ref name="HKMJ 1998"/&gt; also reports Yi's (1996)&lt;ref name="Yi Seong-mi" /&gt; study of the history of such screens. He attempts to establish whether they were used at the start of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] reigned by [[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]] (r. 1392&amp;ndash;1398). One suggestion Yi reports is that the practice of using the Five Peaks screen was established by [[Jeong Do-jeon]]. He was instrumental in the adoption of [[Neo-Confucianism]] as the Joseon's state [[ideology]]. Jeong Do-jeon used the screen as an important part of the design of the Joseon palace architecture in 1392. However, there is a painting from the 16th century referred to as "The martial arts performance at Soch'ong-dae in the reign of [[Myeongjong of Joseon|King Myeongjong]]" (r. 1545&amp;ndash;1567) and there is no screen behind the throne. A 19th century copy however has the screen in place behind the throne. Yi therefore suggests that the 1392 date might be far too early and prefers a more recent date for the establishment of the screens. He suggests that screens role might well have been adopted after the 1592 [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Imjin wars]] as an attempt to reaffirm the dynasty's power. [[Image:Sungmundang (interior 2), Changgyeonggung - Seoul, Korea.jpg|thumb|Right|The Irworobongdo at Changgyeonggung]]

The [[National Museum of Korea]]'s entry on the screens asserts that the earliest written evidence for the use of a Sun, Moon, and Five Peaks screen in the Joseon palace dates from the mid-seventeenth century, but suggests that they could have been used earlier, as part of the Joseon court tried to distinguish itself from that of the [[Goryeo]] court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emuseum.go.kr/eng/mus/nat_10.jsp The National Museum of Korea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216035810/http://www.emuseum.go.kr/eng/mus/nat_10.jsp |date=2012-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palace records suggest that the screens were constantly being produced. Today however, only around twenty originals remain. None are signed. Examples of the screens can be seen at royal palaces in [[Seoul]] such as at [[Gyeongbokgung|Gyeongbok Palace]], [[Changdeokgung|Changdeok Palace]] and [[Changgyeonggung]].&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

[[File:PorruaBookstoreRepArgJusSierra.JPG|thumb|Original store in the historic center of Mexico City]]
'''Librería Porrúa Hermanos y Compañía''' [[S.A. de C.V.]] is a [[bookseller]] and [[publishing company]] in [[Mexico]], and is one of the longest-established businesses operating in the Mexican [[book trade (disambiguation)|book trade]]. The Porrúa name has been associated with books and publishing since the beginning of the 20th century, through its flagship '''Librería Porrúa''' bookstore in [[Mexico City]] and subsidiary stores throughout the country, and the company's renowned and extensive publishing business operating under the names and [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s of '''Librería Porrúa Hermanos''' and '''Editorial Porrúa'''.

==History==
Hermanos Porrúa has over 100 years of history as bookseller and publisher in Mexico. In the second half of the 19th century, three brothers emigrated from [[Spain]] to Mexico City: José, Indalecio and Francisco Porrúa. Indalecio had a market stall on what is now Del Carmen Street, north northwest of the [[Zócalo]], in which he had a sign stating that he bought and sold libraries. His business was successful enough that he asked his brothers to join him. The libraries that they purchased were important not only for the works that they contained but also because from whom they were purchased, including some of the Mexico City’s nobility. They published Mexico’s first bibliography called the “Boletín Bibliográfico” which categorized the antique books for sale. It and others like it would set the value of most of the antique books in Mexico over the following century.&lt;ref name="conocenos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.porrua.com/tienda_conocenos.asp |title=Librería Hermanos Porrúa |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901210345/http://www.porrua.com/tienda_conocenos.asp |archivedate=2009-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing==
Porrúa began publishing in 1910, starting with a “Guide to the City of Mexico” by José Romero, physically printed in Spain but distributed in Mexico by Porrúa. Four years later, the first book completely published in Mexico, a collection of poems, was offered by the company. The company’s logo, called the “Caballero Aguila” (Eagle Knight) was devised in 1915 by Saturnino Herrán. During the 1930s (at least), the business published as "Porrúa Hermanos y compania".&lt;ref name="WorldCat"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=kw%3APorr%C3%BAa+Hermanos+y+compania&amp;qt=results_page|title=Librería Hermanos Porrúa |accessdate=2013-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern organization of the business took shape in 1940, changing its name to Editorial Porrúa and the company began printing specialty books, such as those on law and art. In 1959, Porrúa began printing a series of classical works with the aim of making these more affordable to the general public. Starting in 1964, Porrúa began publishing its own reference work called “El Diccionario de Historia Biografía y Geografía de México” (Dictionary of the History, Biographies and Geography of Mexico) and in 1992 began a division dedicated to young readers, starting with a version of the story of [[Don Quixote]].&lt;ref name="conocenos"/&gt;

==Bookstore==
The original site of Librería Hermanos Porrúa is at the corner of República de Argentina and Justo Sierra Street in the historic center of [[Mexico City]]. The building was originally a house that dates from the 18th century and has two floors. The outside of the building maintains much of original décor, such as the geometric design on both floors, a niche with a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] and iron railings on the windows of the upper floor. The inside of the building has been completely modernized and the lower floor is dedicated to the bookstore.&lt;ref name="Horz"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia Oficial Centro de la Ciudad de México  |last=Horz de Via (ed)  |first=Elena  |year=1991  |publisher= INAH-SALVAT |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-32-0540-2  |page=52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the original store in the Centro Histórico, Porrúa now has stores in all of the states of México and is also present in many location of the department store El Palacio de Hierro and the office supply chain Office Max in México.&lt;ref name="conocenos"/&gt;

This is a list of notable [[implementation]]s of the [[Fizz Buzz]] game.
The task to come up with an implementation for this game is hardly a challenge for routined programmers and therefore often used as [[resume screening|screening]] test in interview situations.

== Fizz Buzz implementations by programming language ==

=== C ===
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
void fizzbuzz()
{
	int i;

	for (i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {
		if (i % 3 &amp;&amp; i % 5)
			printf("%d", i);
		if (i % 3 == 0)
			printf("Fizz");
		if (i % 5 == 0)
			printf("Buzz");
		putchar(' ');
	}
	putchar('\n');
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A shorter and faster version:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
static const char *vals[] = {
	"%d ", "%d ", "Fizz ", "%d ", "Buzz ", "Fizz ", "%d ", "%d ",
	"Fizz ", "Buzz ", "%d ", "Fizz ", "%d ", "%d ", "FizzBuzz "
};

void fizzbuzz()
{
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)
		printf(vals[i % 15], i+1);
	putchar('\n');
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== JavaScript ===
A details version using [[JavaScript]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
// Initialize a string variable for the output
var output = '';

// Count to 100 using i as the counter
for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {

    // If i is not divisible by 3 or 5, append the number itself.
    // Note: In JavaScript, non-zero integers are considered as
    // truthy values, therefore if there's a remainder on both,
    // we append the number instead.
    if (i % 5 &amp;&amp; i % 3) {
        output += i + ' ';
    }

    // If i is divisible by 3 with no remainder, append Fizz
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
        output += 'Fizz ';
    }

    // If i is divisible by 5 with no remainder, append Buzz
    if (i % 5 === 0) {
        output += 'Buzz ';
    }
}

// Print the output to the console
console.log(output);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A shorter version:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
var o='';
for (var i=1; i&lt;=100; i++) {
    i%3 || (o+='Fizz ');
    i%5 || (o+='Buzz ');
    !(i%3 &amp;&amp; i%5) || (o+=(i+' ')); 
}
console.log(o);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===C#===
An implementation in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="C#"&gt;
class Program
{
    public void FizzBuzzGo()
    {
        Boolean Fizz = false;
        Boolean Buzz = false;
        for (int count = 1; count &lt;= 100; count++)
        {
            Fizz = count % 3 == 0;
            Buzz = count % 5 == 0;
            if (Fizz &amp;&amp; Buzz)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Fizz Buzz");
            }
            else if (Fizz)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Fizz");
            }
            else if (Buzz)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Buzz");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine(count);
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Elixir===
An implementation in [[Elixir (programming language)]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="Elixir"&gt;
defmodule FizzBuzz do
  defp fizbuzz(0,0,_), do: "FizzBuzz"
  defp fizbuzz(0,_,_), do: "Fizz"    
  defp fizbuzz(_,0,_), do: "Buzz"    
  defp fizbuzz(_,_,n), do: n
  def fizbuzz(n), do: f1(rem(n,3), rem(n,5), n)
end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===F#===
An implementation in [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]]
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
let to_string i = match i%3, i%5 with
    | 0,0 -&gt; "FizzBuzz"
    | 0,_ -&gt; "Fizz"
    | _,0 -&gt; "Buzz"
    | _ -&gt; string i

for i in 1..100 do
    printfn "%s" (to_string i)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===C++===
Using template metaprogramming in [[C++]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="C++"&gt;
// Helper macros to make compiler output a bit more readable, but keep the
// source readable too.
#define List _
#define Integer __

template &lt;int Condition, typename A, typename B&gt;
struct If;

template &lt;typename A, typename B&gt;
struct If&lt;true, A, B&gt; {
  typedef A result;
};

template &lt;typename A, typename B&gt;
struct If&lt;false, A, B&gt; {
  typedef B result;
};

struct Nil {};
struct Fizz {};
struct Buzz {};
struct FizzBuzz {};
template &lt;int N&gt;
struct Integer {
  static const int value = N;
};

template &lt;typename Head, typename Rest&gt;
struct List {
  typedef Head head;
  typedef Rest rest;
};

template &lt;typename Container, typename Value&gt;
struct PushFront {
  typedef List&lt;Value, Container&gt; result;
};

template &lt;int N&gt;
struct IntToFizzBuzz {
  typedef typename If&lt;
      N % 15 == 0, FizzBuzz,
      typename If&lt;N % 3 == 0, Fizz, typename If&lt;N % 5 == 0, Buzz, Integer&lt;N&gt;&gt;::
                                        result&gt;::result&gt;::result result;
};

template &lt;int N&gt;
struct DoFizzBuzz {
  typedef typename PushFront&lt;typename IntToFizzBuzz&lt;N&gt;::result,
                             typename DoFizzBuzz&lt;N - 1&gt;::result&gt;::result result;
};

template &lt;&gt;
struct DoFizzBuzz&lt;0&gt; {
  typedef Nil result;
};

template &lt;typename T&gt;
struct Print;

Print&lt;DoFizzBuzz&lt;100&gt;::result&gt; ___;

// Will print when attempting to compile with gcc 5.4:
// fizzbuzz.cc:61:32: error: aggregate ‘Print&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;_&lt;Nil, __&lt;1&gt; &gt;, __&lt;2&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;4&gt; &gt;, Buzz&gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;7&gt; &gt;, __&lt;8&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, Buzz&gt;, __&lt;11&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;13&gt; &gt;, __&lt;14&gt; &gt;, FizzBuzz&gt;, __&lt;16&gt; &gt;, __&lt;17&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;19&gt; &gt;, Buzz&gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;22&gt; &gt;, __&lt;23&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, Buzz&gt;, __&lt;26&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;28&gt; &gt;, __&lt;29&gt; &gt;, FizzBuzz&gt;, __&lt;31&gt; &gt;, __&lt;32&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;34&gt; &gt;, Buzz&gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;37&gt; &gt;, __&lt;38&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, Buzz&gt;, __&lt;41&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;43&gt; &gt;, __&lt;44&gt; &gt;, FizzBuzz&gt;, __&lt;46&gt; &gt;, __&lt;47&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;49&gt; &gt;, Buzz&gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;52&gt; &gt;, __&lt;53&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, Buzz&gt;, __&lt;56&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;58&gt; &gt;, __&lt;59&gt; &gt;, FizzBuzz&gt;, __&lt;61&gt; &gt;, __&lt;62&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;64&gt; &gt;, Buzz&gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;67&gt; &gt;, __&lt;68&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, Buzz&gt;, __&lt;71&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;73&gt; &gt;, __&lt;74&gt; &gt;, FizzBuzz&gt;, __&lt;76&gt; &gt;, __&lt;77&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;79&gt; &gt;, Buzz&gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;82&gt; &gt;, __&lt;83&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, Buzz&gt;, __&lt;86&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;88&gt; &gt;, __&lt;89&gt; &gt;, FizzBuzz&gt;, __&lt;91&gt; &gt;, __&lt;92&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;94&gt; &gt;, Buzz&gt;, Fizz&gt;, __&lt;97&gt; &gt;, __&lt;98&gt; &gt;, Fizz&gt;, Buzz&gt; &gt; ___’ has incomplete type and cannot be defined
//  Print&lt;DoFizzBuzz&lt;100&gt;::result&gt; ___;
//                                 ^
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Perl 6===
A FizzBuzzWoof implementation in [[Perl 6]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="perl6"&gt;
my @numbers = (0..1000);
for @numbers -&gt; $x {
    given $x {
        when $x %% 105 {
            say "FizzBuzzWoof"
        }
        when $x %% 15 {
            say "FizzBuzz"
        }
        when $x %% 21 {
            say "FizzWoof"
        }
        when $x %% 35 {
            say "BuzzWoof"
        }
        when $x %% 3 {
            say "Fizz"
        }
        when $x %% 5 {
            say "Buzz"
        }
        when $x %% 7 {
            say "Woof"
        }
        default {
            say $x
        }
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Python===
As a [[One-liner program|one-liner]] in [[Python (programming language)|Python 2]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
print ['Fizz' * (i%3 &lt; 1) + 'Buzz' * (i%5 &lt; 1) or i for i in range(1,101)]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The one-liner needs to be slightly modified for [[Python (programming language)|Python 3]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
print(['Fizz' * (i%3 &lt; 1) + 'Buzz' * (i%5 &lt; 1) or i for i in range(1, 101)])
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Kotlin===
An implementation in [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="kotlin"&gt;
fun fizzBuzz() {
    for(i in 1..100) {
        val fizz = i % 3 == 0
        val buzz = i % 5 == 0
        
    	println(when {
            fizz &amp;&amp; buzz -&gt; "FizzBuzz"
            fizz         -&gt; "Fizz"
            buzz         -&gt; "Buzz"
            else         -&gt; i
        })
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A more general version, which allows user defined conditions:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="kotlin"&gt;
fun generalFizzBuzz(end: Int, vararg conditions: Pair&lt;Int, String&gt;) {
    for(i in 1..end) {
        val words = conditions.filter { i % it.first == 0 }
        			    	  .joinToString("") { it.second }
        
        println(when(words) {
            ""   -&gt; i
            else -&gt; words
        })
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Elm===
An implementation in [[Elm (programming language)|Elm]] that produces HTML output:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="elm"&gt;
fizzBuzzHelper : Int -&gt; String
fizzBuzzHelper x =
    let
        byThree = modBy 3 x == 0
        byFive  = modBy 5 x == 0
    in
        if      byThree &amp;&amp; byFive then "FizzBuzz"
        else if byThree           then "Fizz"
        else if byFive            then "Buzz"
        else                           String.fromInt x

            
fizzBuzz : Html Msg
fizzBuzz = div []
           &lt;| List.concatMap (\s -&gt; [ text s, Html.br [] [] ])
           &lt;| List.map fizzBuzzHelper (List.range 0 256)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

[[File:Matteo Bandello.jpg|thumb|right|Matteo Bandello]]
'''Matteo Bandello''' ({{lang-fr|Mathieu Bandel}}; {{circa}} 1480 &amp;ndash; 1562) was an Italian writer, soldier, monk, and later, a Bishop mostly known for his novellas.

==Biography==

[[File:Castel Goffredo Palazzo Gonzaga-Acerbi.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Castel Goffredo]], palace Gonzaga-Acerbi.]]
Matteo Bandello was born at [[Castelnuovo Scrivia]], near [[Tortona]] (current [[Piedmont]]), {{circa}} 1480. He received a good education, and entered the church, but does not seem to have been very interested in [[theology]]. For many years he lived at [[Mantua]] and [[Castel Goffredo]], and superintended the education of the celebrated [[Lucrezia Gonzaga]], in whose honour he composed a long poem. The decisive [[Battle of Pavia]], as a result of which [[Lombardy]] was taken by the emperor, compelled Bandello to flee; his house at [[Milan]] was burnt and his property confiscated. He took refuge with [[Cesare Fregoso]], an Italian general in the French service, whom he accompanied into France.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

He was later raised to the [[bishopric of Agen]], a town in which he resided for many years before his death in 1562. Bandello wrote a number of poems, but his fame rests entirely on his extensive collection of Novelle, or tales (1554, 1573), which have been extremely popular. They belong to the same genre as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]’s ''[[Decameron]]'' and [[Marguerite de Navarre]]’s ''[[Heptameron]]''. The common origin of them all is to be found in the old French ''[[fabliaux]]''{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, though some well-known tales are evidently Eastern, and others classical. Bandello’s novellas are thought the best of those written in imitation of the Decameron, though Italian critics find fault with them for negligence and inelegance of style.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

The stories on which [[William Shakespeare]] based several of his plays (''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' in particular)&lt;ref name="SHEMEK"/&gt; were supplied by Bandello, probably through [[Francois de Belleforest|Belleforest]] and [[Pierre Boaistuau]] whose stories were later translated into English by [[William Painter (author)|William Paynter]] and included in his ''The Palace of Pleasure''. Another of his stories includes "The countess of Cellant", a distortion of Challand, a northwest region of Italy.

==English translations of novellas==
The only nearly complete translation of Bandello's tales into English is "The novels of Matteo Bandello", translated by [[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]] in 6 volumes, 1890.&lt;ref name="PAYNE"/&gt; This edition is separated into 4 parts, containing 51, 43, 51, and 21 stories, respectively, for a total of 166, minus two (part 2, story 35 and part 4, story 6), omitted because of their being almost identical to those of Marguerite the Navarre's Heptameron (stories 30 and 17), respectively, though keeping Bandello's dedicatory preface.

The Payne translation is a mixture of 19th and 16th century idioms. Examples of the latter include "an thou wilt" instead of "if you will", "wheneas" instead of "when", "methinketh" instead of "I think", "parlous" instead of "perilous". On most occasions, the language is clear and of fine literary value, but sometimes it is degraded with terms no one ever spoke or wrote. For example, instead of saying "Now I would gladly hear your advice on this matter", the duchess of Amalfi says: "Now I would fain hear from thee that which thou counsellest thereanent."

There is a second book of Bandello in an English translation by Percy Pinkerton and containing twelve tales.&lt;ref name="PINKERTON"/&gt; This translation uses a more modern mode of expression.

==Source material==
The vast majority of the stories derive from those Bandello heard from contemporaries, reported as real life events. Far more rarely, some stories are based on literary or historical sources, such as book 5 of Dante's Purgatory (part 1, story 11), the Lucretia and Tarquin episode in Livy's History of Rome (part 2, story 15), story #23 of the Heptameron (part 2, story 17), and Francesco Petrarch's Triumph of Love from ''[[Triumphs]]'' (part 2, story 41). Some derive from English history, such as the chronicle of Mary Douglas, niece to King Henry VIII of England (part 3, story 44) and Henry VIII's six wives (part 3, story 45), some from Spanish history, such as Alfonso X (part 4, story 10). All of them were told to him by men, but a minority of dedicatory prefaces are offered to women. Bandello writes that the dedicatory prefaces to the nobility or to worthy persons are useful to him as a shield in case someone becomes offended by one of the stories and is tempted to attack him (part 2, story 32). He shows psychological insight into jealousy, in particular the description of two types of jealous men, the first from feelings of inadequacy and the second from feelings of the fickleness of women (part 3, story 47).

The most striking stories include two whores seeking to win their husbands back (part 1, story 17), two brother thieves in cahoots to rob the treasures of the king of Egypt (part 1, story 23), a disdained lover voluntarily choosing to live inside a cave (part 1, story 25), a woman killing herself only out of fear that her good fortune will turn bad (part 1, story 48), [[Filippo Lippi]], released from slavery in Africa because of his talent as a celebrated painter (part 1, story 50), a woman disdaining a man and then killing herself when he no longer pursues her (part 2, story 16), an abbot making music from a chorus of pigs (part 2, story 23), an adulterous lover buried alive and then saved (part 3, story 1), a merchant's murder of another (part 4, story 1), a case of double adultery whereby each husband cuckolds the other (part 4, story 11), and two women yelling at each other after being falsely told they are hard of hearing (part 4, story 21).

==Plays by Shakespeare==
Four Bandello stories were adapted by Shakespeare, including ''[[Cymbeline]]'' (part 1, story 19), the Claudio subplot of ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' (part 1, story 20), ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (part 2, story 6), and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (part 2, story 28), plus one from the [[Shakespeare Apocrypha]], ''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]]'' (part 2, story 29).

==Plays by others==
Bandello stories have also been adapted by other dramatists, including [[John Webster]], ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'' (part 1, story 24), [[Philip Massinger]], ''[[The Picture (Massinger play)|The Picture]]'' (part 1, story 19), the same source as that of Cymbeline, [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]] and [[Jean Mairet]], ''[[Sophonisba]]'' (part 1, story 35), [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], ''[[The Maid's Tragedy|The Maid in the Inn]]'' (part 2, story 11), the anonymous 17th century French author of ''[[The Cruel Moor]]'' (1618) (part 3, story 17), [[Giuseppe Giacosa]], ''La Signora di Challant'', ''[[The Lady of Challand]]'' (part 1, story 4) and [[Lope de Vega]], ''Castelvines y Monteses'' (published in 1647 and written between 1604 and 1618).

'''''Meet the Applegates''''' is a 1990 American comedy directed by [[Michael Lehmann]]. It was filmed in 1989, but not released until 1991 due to the financial difficulties surrounding [[New World Pictures]], the film's production company. It takes a dark, satirical look at the end of the world, nuclear holocausts, alienism and terrorism. It was filmed in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin|Oshkosh]], [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]] and [[Neenah, Wisconsin]]. It has gained a cult following.

==Plot==
The film starts off in a forest with a family being attacked by a family of huge [[Mantis|Brazilian Cocorada]]. It then moves to a typical-looking family moving into a well-off suburban [[Ohio]] neighborhood. They are the bugs that were seen earlier, after they took on human form and met every "normality" standard from the magazine ''Family Bazaar''. They moved to the suburbs after the husband, Richard, got a job at a [[nuclear power]] plant; he works there in order to cause an explosion one day that will rid the world of humans and leave bugs in peace. But after a while they drift from all-American family normalities &amp;mdash; the son, Johnny, a straight-laced A student, begins listening to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and becomes a junkie; Richard and his wife, Jane, drift away from each other, he having an affair at work and she becoming attached to her credit card; lastly the daughter, Sally, becomes a pregnant [[lesbian]] after being raped by a jock from the high school. 

They each show their true bug form at least once in the film: Johnny while smoking [[marijuana]] with his metalhead buddies, Sally while being raped by the jock, Richard when infiltrating the nuclear plant, and  Jane when two ''Family Bazaar'' agents come to their house. As they drift away from normality (and nearly being found out by the neighbors) their aunt, Bea, is sent to help. She becomes a nuisance and they decide she should be taken care of. Richard decides to not blow up the plant, and kills Bea instead. At the end of the movie they return to their lives in Brazil, and are visited by the townspeople that grew to love them. Although the plant did not blow up, enough radiation was released to remove the hair from much of the town's population.

A deleted scene reveals that Aunt Bea survived and still intends to destroy the world.

'''''Moment by Moment: The Healing Journey of Molly Hale''''' is a 2005 [[documentary]] film by filmmaker, [[Dorothy Fadiman]], which is about Molly Hale, a woman who suffered a spinal cord injury so severe that attending medical professionals had little hope for the rehabilitation of feeling and movement below her shoulders.  The film chronicles Molly's recovery process and the support from her partner and community of friends.

In the Winter of 2002, Molly Hale was chosen to be an Olympic torchbearer by the [[Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref name=PaloAltoWeeklyOnlineEdition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/2002/2002_01_16.dtorch16.html|work=Palo Alto Weekly Online Edition|title=Carrying her torch, Menlo Park woman to participate in Olympic Run| accessdate=January 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tombola au parc Sohmer Montreal.jpg|thumb|A fundraising event in 1890 for the construction of the Monument-National]]
The '''Monument-National''' is a historic Canadian theatre located at 1182 [[Saint Laurent Boulevard]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. Erected between 1891 and 1894, it was originally the cultural centre of the [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society]].

The building was designed by [[Maurice Perrault]], [[Albert Mesnard]] and [[Joseph Venne]] in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival style]] and utilizes a steel frame—a building technique that was innovative for its time.&lt;ref name=CRHP1&gt;{{CRHP|7154|Le Monument-National|August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yiddish theatre==
The first performance of a [[Yiddish]] play was held there in what is now the theatre's Ludger-Duvernay room in the winter of 1896. The Monument-National was a key cultural landmark in [[Historic Jewish Quarter, Montreal|Montreal's historic Jewish quarter]], and it continued to host productions from touring and local Yiddish theatre companies until the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Parks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/culture/proj/main/corridor1/corridor2.aspx|title=Boulevard Saint-Laurent: Corridor for Immigration, Business and Development|date=2009-04-15|work=Parks Canada Web site|accessdate=2009-05-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605115540/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/culture/proj/main/corridor1/corridor2.aspx|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NTS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent-nts.ca/journal/j25p04_looking.htm|title=Looking Back : Monumental|date=Spring 2004|work=National Theatre School of Canada Web site|accessdate=2009-05-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925004343/http://ent-nts.ca/journal/j25p04_looking.htm|archivedate=2009-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://imjm.ca/location/1364 | title=Interactive Museum of Jewish Montreal |accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovations and current status==
The theatre was declared a historic monument by the [[Ministère des Affaires culturelles du Québec]] in 1976,&lt;ref name=CRHP1/&gt; and a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|14663|Monument National National Historic Site of Canada|August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major restoration project of the theatre was completed in June 1993, in time for the theatre's centennial celebration. The 1,620-seat theatre has been owned by the [[National Theatre School of Canada]] since 1971, and it is the venue used for its productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0002439|title=Monument national|work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|author=[[Gilles Potvin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was opened in 1844 and remained active until the theatre building was severely damaged by the Fire of Pera in 1870.&lt;ref name=vatan/&gt;&lt;ref name=pasaj&gt;[http://www.tarihicicekpasaji.com/tarihce.php History of the Çiçek Pasajı in Istanbul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812051928/http://www.tarihicicekpasaji.com/tarihce.php |date=2012-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruined theatre building was purchased by [[Ottoman Greeks|Ottoman Greek]] banker [[Hristaki Zoğrafos|Hristaki Zoğrafos Efendi]], who built the present-day [[Çiçek Pasajı]] on its land plot in 1876.&lt;ref name=pasaj/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Naum Tiyatrosu.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A reception held at the theatre in honour of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], a city he lived in for 3 years, at the Naum Theatre in Pera. Built in 1848 on the site of an earlier wooden theatre that was destroyed in fire, this building served as the chief opera house of Constantinople, until it too was destroyed by a fire in 1870.]]
The Naum Theatre was originally built as the ''Bosco Theatre'' by [[Italy|Italian]] [[magic (illusion)|illusionist]] [[Bartolomeo Bosco]], on a land plot on İstiklal Avenue owned by the Naum family,&lt;ref name=vatan/&gt; as a wooden [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman style]] building.&lt;ref name=vatan/&gt; After Bartolomeo Bosco left the city, the ownership of the building passed to Michel Naum and Joseph Naum; who, upon completing the renovation works, reopened it with the name ''Théatre de Péra'' in 1844.&lt;ref name=vatan/&gt; The first play to be performed in the theatre was the opera play ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' by [[Vincenzo Bellini]].&lt;ref name=vatan/&gt;

After this original wooden building suffered damage from fire, a new theatre building was constructed in 1849 and was opened with the name ''Théatre Italien Naum''.&lt;ref name=vatan/&gt; The theatre was frequently visited by Sultans [[Abdülaziz]] and [[Abdülhamid II]], and hosted [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s play ''[[Il Trovatore]]'' before the opera houses of Paris.&lt;ref name=pasaj/&gt; The majority of the opera plays that were performed at the Naum Theatre were composed by Vincenzo Bellini, [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].&lt;ref name=vatan/&gt; In [[Flaubert's letters|a letter to his mother]], [[Gustave Flaubert]] wrote that he watched a play by Donizetti at the Naum Theatre in Istanbul the day following his arrival to the city.&lt;ref name=vatan/&gt;

Michel and Joseph Naum were the sole owners in Istanbul of the rights to display many European theatre and opera plays, and brought many foreign [[wikt:troupe#Noun|troupe]]s to Istanbul.&lt;ref name=vatan/&gt; They also printed the first [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] translations of the opera plays in the form of booklets.&lt;ref name=vatan/&gt; Apart from the usual evening plays, they also organized daytime plays for groups of viewers coming from the Asian side of the [[Bosphorus]].&lt;ref name=vatan/&gt;

===Çiçek Pasajı===
After the Fire of Pera in 1870, the ruined theatre building was purchased by the local Greek banker [[Hristaki Zoğrafos|Hristaki Zoğrafos Efendi]], and architect Kleanthis Zannos designed the current [[Çiçek Pasajı]] building, which was constructed in 1876 on the theatre's former land plot.&lt;ref name=pasaj/&gt;

'''''Nocturne: Blue and Silver – Chelsea''''' is a painting. It is the earliest of the London Nocturnes by [[James McNeill Whistler]].

The work has influences from [[Asian art|Oriental art]]. The connection to [[Woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese prints]] and [[Chinese paintings]] is underscored by Whistler's use of the 'butterfly' signature in the centre of the bottom edge of the painting.

'''One/Off Printmakers''' (1983-2017) was a group of professional printmakers formed in 1983 based in, but not limited to, [[Richmond, Virginia]], who exhibited together for over thirty years in many venues throughout the world. The group originated at and was instrumental in the success of the [[Richmond Printmaking Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ONE/OFF Printmakers Opening Reception|url=http://www.virginialiving.com/events/oneoff-printmakers-opening-reception/)|accessdate=4 October 2016|publisher=Virginia Living|date=November 2012|quote=Members of ONE/OFF were integral to establishing and operating the Richmond Printmaking Workshop, a non-profit, communal print space that was a keystone of the local art community for over a decade.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the [[Richmond Printmaking Workshop|RPW]], many of the One/Off Printmakers were faculty members or [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A]] alumni at [[Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts|Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts]], the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts|Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Studio School]], the [[Hand Workshop]] (now [[VisArts]]), [[Sweet Briar College]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond City schools]], or the [[University of Richmond]].

== History of One/Off ==
Printmakers working at the [[Richmond Printmaking Workshop]] on West Cary Street in Richmond formed a Print Club for both artists and patrons. The Print Club published periodically beginning around 1982 a photocopied ''Print Club Newsletter'' with the Workshop's logo of a black octopus, the same design which was emblazoned on a large exterior wall of the large studio and meeting space for the group also known as the [[Richmond Printmaking Workshop|RPW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Print Club Newsletter|agency=RPW|publisher=Richmond Printmaking Workshop|date=February 1982|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newsletter recounts that RPW founder Nancy David (who had been a student in the silkscreen and lithography classes taught by Marilyn Bevilacqua at the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] Studio School) received a technical assistance grant from the [[Virginia Commission for the Arts]] to attend the Bookworks '82 Conference held at the [[Moore College of Art]] in Philadelphia, "a meeting for artists, writers, and publishers of small and unique editions." Also attending Bookworks '82 as panelists were Bruce Schnabel, an RPW bookbinding instructor, and Janet Dalberto of the Special Collections Department of [[Virginia Commonwealth University|Virginia Commonwealth University's]] Cabell Library. Richmond representatives to Bookworks '82 viewed an exhibition by the Philadelphia Print Club of one-of-a-kind (i.e. one/off) books, many of handmade paper.

[[Walter Hamady]] of the [[University of Wisconsin]] lectured at Bookworks '82 about handmade paper and described his studio near [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. During the conference, the Helen Drutt Gallery featured Bruce Schnabel's one-of-a-kind books. The ''Print Club Newsletter" related that "one of the best by-products of the meeting was the opportunity to meet and exchange information with others involved in book art."

The same year, the RPW in Richmond was visited by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to consider funding. The ''Print Club Newsletter'' stated that the people the [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]] sends "are usually professionals from similar areas of pursuit as the organization hosting the visit, and they are always from a different part of the country to avoid partiality. They receive payment only for their expenses." The RPW was visited by Sheila levrant de Bretteville of the Communications Art Department at the [[Otis/Parsons|Otis Parsons Institute]] in Los Angeles. Also during this time, the commissioners of the [[Virginia Commission for the Arts]] visited [[1708 Gallery]] and the
[[Richmond Printmaking Workshop]], and a fundraising Octoberfest and Holiday Open House was led by Board member [[Joseph H. Seipel|Joe Seipel]], the Texas Wisconsin Border Café, and Board president Cynthia Schaal to support both 1708 and the Richmond Printmaking Workshop. The announcement for the open house was printed on the RPW's Chandler press with [[moveable type]] recently donated   by Walter Garde, Jr.
 
By the time the [[Richmond Printmaking Workshop]] closed its doors, the One/Off Printmakers group of professional printmakers had already begun, drawing from the RPW Print Club and building on the experience and leadership of RPW founder Nancy David and former RPW directors [[Laura Pharis]] and Mary Holland. At its beginnings, almost every member of One/Off had at one time or another used the presses or participated as instructor or student in the workshops at the Richmond Printmaking Workshop.

In 2016 ONE/OFF Printmaker Jack Glover&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Glover's still busy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAXivu0wMz4|website=You Tube|accessdate=8 October 2016|date=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; received the [[Theresa Pollak]] award for excellence in the arts from Richmond Magazine.

== Virginia and regional exhibitions ==
One of One/Off's first exhibitions was at Reynolds Minor Gallery when that gallery was on Franklin Street in Richmond.
In 2002 members of One/Off exhibited a group show at [[Artspace in Richmond, Virginia|Artspace Gallery]] on Broad Street in Richmond, Virginia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ONE/OFF Printmakers: A Survey|url=http://www.artspacegallery.org/2002/exhibits/oneoff/index.htm|website=Artspace|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also participated in an [[Art-o-mat]] vintage cigarette vending machine installation at [[Artspace in Richmond, Virginia|Artspace]] with small cellophane-wrapped art in simulated cigarette packs weighted to dispense in the vintage machine with a purchased $5 token. The concept of old cigarette machines vending art was the original idea of [[Clark Whittington]] and his group ''Artists in Cellophane''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One/Off Exhibits at Artspace|url=http://www.artspacegallery.org/2002/exhibits/oneoff/index.htm|website=Artspace|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the years, some of the One/Off participating artists were [[David Freed (Printmaker)|David Freed]], [[Barbara Tisserat]], Kelly Nelson, Aijung Kim, Chris Palmer, Walter Garde, Mitzi Humphrey, Mary Holland, [[Laura Pharis]], Paula Nottingham, Peter Calvert, Anne Chenoweth, Warren Corrado, Nick Cossitt, Janet DeCover, Nancy David, Don Earley, Steven Fishman, Kris Iden, Jim Nottingham, Mel Paca, [[Jack Glover (artist)|Jack Glover]], Tucker Hill, [[Tanja Softic]], Dawn Latané, Carolyn Sharp, Kate Horne, Randy Toy, Suzanne Fortin, Philip Wetton, Joan Gaustad, Ronnie Sampson and Janet Gilmore Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artspace 2002 exhibits of oneoff|url=http://www.artspacegallery.org/2002/exhibits/oneoff/index.htm|website=Artspace|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a ONE/OFF Printmakers' exhibition of members' art was at Main Art Gallery on Main Street in Richmond, Virginia, and another group show that year was at Middle Street Gallery in [[Washington, Virginia]]. The group  presented a print show in 2007 in the large
exhibition area of the Montpelier Art Center, [[Montpelier, Hanover County, Virginia|Montpelier, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2007|url=http://www.worksbywinston.com/timeline/2007|website=Dennis Winston|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 One/Off Printmakers celebrated the 25th anniversary of the organization with an exhibition at the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] Studio School gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One/Off Printmakers: 25th Anniversary Show|url=https://rvanews.com/etc/oneoff-printmakers-25th-anniversary-show/3447|website=RVANews|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=11 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the group again showed at Middle Street Gallery in Washington, Virginia.

On loan from the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] collection, One/Off Printmakers showed ''Three One/Off Portfolios'' at [[Art6|Art6 Gallery]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Humphrey|first1=Thomas|title=Three Abstract Portfolios|url=http://www.jimmywarnerdesign.com/art6_archives/art6download/BroadStrokesbyMonth/issue5.pdf|website=Jimmy Warner Design|publisher=Art6 Gallery|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen artists of One/Off Printmakers were featured in the front gallery of Chroma Projects in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], with a Charlottesville [[First Friday (public event)|First Friday]] opening reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chroma Projects: One/Off Richmond Printmakers, Tim Michel, Jim Henry, and Gary Michael Keyes|url=http://www.readthehook.com/102175/chroma-projects-oneoff-richmond-printmakers-tim-michel-jim-henry-and-gary-michael-keyes|website=www.readthehook.com|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goings On November 01, 2011|url=http://franklinfurnace.org/goings_on/recent_goings_on/2011/11_11_01.php|website=franklinfurnace.org|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pantomime Theatre''' ({{lang-da|Pantomimeteateret}}) is an open-air theatre located in the [[Tivoli Gardens]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. As indicated by the name, it is primarily used for pantomime theatre in the classical Italian [[commedia dell'arte]] tradition which is performed daily. Besides this original function, the theatre leads a second life as a venue for [[ballet]] and [[modern dance]].

==History==
[[File:Tivolis første pantomimeteater.jpg|thumb|left||The first Pantomime Theatre]] 
When the Tivoli Gardens first opened in 1874, a small theatre was already found at the site of the current building just inside the main entrance. It was made out of timber and painted [[canvas]] and after a series of rebuilding and major repairs, it was finally decided to replace it with a more up-to-date building in 1873. The architect [[Vilhelm Dahlerup]], at that time working on the design of the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] was commissioned to make a proposal and the year after in 1874, the same year as the Royal Theatre, the present Peacock Theatre in Chinese style was inaugurated. Dahlerup had never been to China but he sought inspiration from pictures of buildings, borrowed from an engineer who had been stationed in the Far East.&lt;ref name=Ostergaard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erikoest.dk/pt_uk.htm#top|title=Pantomimes|publisher=Erik Østergaard|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical side of the project was constructed by the theatre's director and Pierrot Niels Hendrik Volkersen and timber and assistance with the [[rope|cordage]] was obtained from the [[Holmen naval base]].&lt;ref name=Ostergaard /&gt;

==Architecture==
[[Image:Pantomimeteatret, Tivoli Gardens.jpg|thumb|250px|The stage with the Peacock Curtain]]
It is a toy-like [[historicism|Historicist]] theatre built in Chinese style and noted for its mechanical front curtain that takes five men to operate and unfolds like a [[peafowl|peacock-s tail]].

==Repertoire==
The repertoire consists of a mixture of traditional pantomimes, ballet performances and contemporary and more experimental performances.

===Pantomime===
[[Image:Harlekin Columbine Tivoli Denmark.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Harlekin and Columbine at The Pantomime Theatre]]
The pantomime tradition of the theatre is a mixture of many elements that are apparently quite unrelated. When the peacock folds down its wings, the stage is obviously set somewhere in old Copenhagen, at the home of stodgy Cassander who lives alone with his beautiful daughter, [[Columbina|Columbine]]. It remains unclear what has happened to her mother. Cassander is assisted by his servant, [[Pierrot]], who has a white face like the clown he really is. And Cassander’s adversary with whom he is constantly struggling is [[Harlequin]] – a charming, masked scoundrel with little money to his name but who is deeply in love with Columbine and often well-connected to a friendly sorcerer or fairy.

Like the characters, the music comes from many different sources. It includes Strauss, Mozart and Gounod – and, needless to say, lots of music by H. C. Lumbye, Tivoli’s in-house composer at one time. The music has been selected to underpin the plot and movements of each pantomime.

===Ballet===
The programme also include ballet performances, including examples of the distinctive Danish [[Bournonville School|Bournonville style]] and modern dance. [[Margrethe II of Denmark|HM Queen Magrethe]] created costumes and scenography several times, including for ballets based on [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Little Match Girl]]'' and ''[[The Swineherd]]'' in 2007&lt;ref name="Ind bag fugletæppet i Tivoli"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlingske.dk/article/20080801/anmeldelser/708010011/|title=Ind bag fugletæppet i Tivoli|publisher=Berlingske|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2009. Choreographers who have created works for the Pantomimeteatret include [[Dinna Bjørn]], Louise Midjord, [[Paul James Rooney]] and Ian Rowe.

===Other performances===
Since 2003 the programme has also involved more contemporary genre like [[jazz dance]] and [[hip hop dance|hip hop]] pantomimes.

==Artists==
Artists who have worked with the Pantomime Theatre include:
* [[Helgi Tómasson (dancer)|Helgi Tomasson]], ballet dancer
* [[Nola Rae]], mime artist
* [[Ronald Smith Wilson]], mime artist, dancer
* [[Margrethe II of Denmark|HM Margrethe II of Denmark]], scenography, costumes
* [[Palle Jacobsen]], ballet master

'''Paper craft''' is the collection of [[art]] forms employing [[paper]] or [[card stock|card]] as the primary [[artistic medium]] for the creation of three-dimensional objects.  It is the most widely used material in arts and crafts. It lends itself to a wide range of techniques, as it can for instance be folded, cut, glued, molded,  stitched, or layered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=6 |title=The Complete Photo Guide to Paper Crafts|first=Patrice |last=Boerens |isbn=978-1-58923-468-0 |publisher=Creative Publishing International |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papermaking]] by hand is also an important paper craft. [[Painting]] and [[calligraphy]] though they are commonly applied as decoration are normally considered as separate arts or crafts.

Paper crafts are known in most societies that use paper, with certain kinds of crafts being particularly associated with specific countries or cultures. In Caribbean countries paper craft is unique to Caribbean culture which reflect the importance of native animals in life of people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caribbean-craft.com/|title=Handmade Home Decor {{!}} Paper Mache {{!}} Caribbean Craft|last=Craft|first=Caribbean|website=www.caribbean-craft.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In addition to the aesthetic value of paper crafts, various forms of paper crafts are used in the [[education]] of children.  Paper is a relatively inexpensive medium, readily available, and easier to work with than the more complicated media typically used in the creation of three-dimensional artwork, such as ceramics, wood, and metals.&lt;ref name="Therapy"&gt;Carol Tubbs, Margaret Drake, ''Crafts and Creative Media in Therapy'', "Paper crafts", (2006), p. 221-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also neater to work with than paints, dyes, and other coloring materials.  Paper crafts may also be used in [[psychotherapy|therapeutic]] settings, providing children with a safe and uncomplicated creative outlet to express feelings.&lt;ref name="Therapy"/&gt;

==Folded paper==
The word "paper" derives from [[papyrus]], the name of the ancient material manufactured from beaten reeds in [[Egypt]] as far back as the third millennium B.C.&lt;ref name=Skeat&gt;[http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat, 1935. "Papyrus and its uses"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018121945/http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html |date=2013-10-18 }} ([[British Museum]] pamphlet).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the earliest known example of "paper folding" is an ancient Egyptian map, drawn on papyrus and folded into rectangular forms like a modern [[road]] [[map]].&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt; However, it does not appear that intricate paper folding as an art form became possible until the introduction of wood-pulp based papers.&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt; 

The first Japanese origami is dated from the 6th century A.D.&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;Lang, Robert James. [1988] (1988). The Complete Book of Origami: Step-by Step Instructions in Over 1000 Diagrams/48 Original Models. Courier Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-25837-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In much of the [[Western world|West]], the term [[origami]] is used synonymously with paper folding, though the term properly only refers to the art of paper folding in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Bible"&gt;Nick Robinson, ''The Origami Bible'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other forms of paper folding include Zhezhi ([[Chinese paper folding]]), Jong-i.e.-jeop-gi, from Korea, and Western paper folding, such as the traditional paper boats and [[paper plane]]s.

==Cut paper==
{{Main|Papercutting}}
[[Papel picado]], as practiced in Mexico and other places in Latin America is done using chisels to cut 50 to a hundred sheets at a time, while [[Chinese paper cutting]] uses knives or scissors for up to 8 sheets. [[Wycinanki]] and other European forms usually are done on one single sheet. In either of these traditions, paper sheets are folded prior to cutting to achieve symmetrical designs.

==Paper pulp painting==

Images built using colored paper pulp are a form of paper art that started in the 20th century. [[Chuck Close]], [[Lynn Sures]] are among contemporary artist developing this medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Silicon Graphics, Inc.''' (later rebranded '''SGI''', historically known as '''Silicon Graphics Computer Systems''' or '''SGCS''') was an American [[high-performance computing]] manufacturer, producing [[computer hardware]] and [[software]]. Founded in [[Mountain View, California]] in November 1981 by [[James H. Clark|Jim Clark]], its initial market was [[3D graphics]] [[computer workstation]]s, but its products, strategies and market positions developed significantly over time.

Early systems were based on the [[Geometry Engine]] that Clark and Marc Hannah had developed at [[Stanford University]], and were derived from Clark's broader background in [[computer graphics]]. The Geometry Engine was the first [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) implementation of a ''[[geometry pipeline]]'', specialized hardware that accelerated the "inner-loop" geometric computations needed to display three-dimensional images. For much of its history, the company focused on 3D imaging and was a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market.

Silicon Graphics reincorporated as a [[Delaware corporation]] in January 1990. Through the mid to late-1990s, the rapidly improving performance of commodity [[Wintel]] machines began to erode SGI's stronghold in the 3D market. The porting of [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to other platforms is a major event in this process. SGI made several attempts to address this, including a disastrous move from their existing [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] platforms to the [[Intel Itanium]], as well as introducing their own [[Linux]]-based [[Intel IA-32]] based workstations and servers that failed in the market. In the mid-2000s the company repositioned itself as a [[supercomputer]] vendor, a move that also failed.

On April 1, 2009, SGI filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to [[Silicon Graphics International|Rackable Systems]], a deal finalized on May 11, 2009, with Rackable assuming the name "Silicon Graphics International". The remains of Silicon Graphics, Inc. became Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc.

==History==
[[File:Silicon Graphics logo.png|thumb|Silicon Graphics logo with distinctive 3-D box "bug"]]

=== Early years ===
[[James H. Clark]] left his position as an electrical engineering associate professor at [[Stanford University]] to found SGI in 1982 along with a group of seven graduate students and research staff from Stanford: [[Kurt Akeley]], [[David J. Brown]], [[Tom Davis (scientist)|Tom Davis]], Rocky Rhodes, [[Marc Hannah]], [[Herb Kuta]], and [[Mark Grossman (engineer)|Mark Grossman]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Jonathan | last=Bowen | authorlink=Jonathan Bowen | chapter=Silicon Graphics, Inc. | editor-first=Raúl | editor-last=Rojas | title=Encyclopedia of Computers and Computer History | publisher = [[Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers]], [[The Moschovitis Group]] | location=New York | date=2001 | pages=709–710 }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Abbey Silverstone]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080609020120/http://www.sgi.com/company_info/features/2007/25_anniv.html The First Quarter-Century], Silicon Graphics, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and a few others.

===Massive growth===
Ed McCracken was [[CEO]] of Silicon Graphics from 1984 to 1997.&lt;ref name=einstein1029&gt;{{cite news|last=Einstein|first=David|title=McCracken leaves SGI; 700 to 1000 laid off|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/McCracken-leaves-SGI-700-to-1000-laid-off-2824550.php|accessdate=December 30, 2013|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 29, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During those years, SGI grew from annual revenues of $5.4 million to $3.7 billion.&lt;ref name=einstein1029/&gt;

===Decline===
The addition of 3D graphic capabilities to [[Personal computer|PC]]s, and the ability of clusters of [[Linux]]- and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]]-based PCs to take on many of the tasks of larger SGI servers, ate into SGI's core markets. The porting of [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] further eroded the low end of SGI's product line.

In response to challenges faced in the marketplace and a falling share price [[Ed McCracken]] was fired and SGI brought in [[Richard Belluzzo]] to replace him. Under Belluzzo's leadership a number of initiatives were taken which are considered to have accelerated the corporate decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

One such initiative was trying to sell workstations running Windows NT called [[SGI Visual Workstation|Visual Workstations]] instead of just ones which ran [[IRIX]], the company's version of UNIX. This put the company in even more direct competition with the likes of Dell, making it more difficult to justify a price premium. The product line was unsuccessful and abandoned a few years later.

SGI's premature announcement of its migration from MIPS to Itanium and its abortive ventures into IA-32 architecture systems (the [[SGI Visual Workstation|Visual Workstation]] line, the ex-Intergraph Zx10 range and the SGI 1000-series Linux servers) damaged SGI's credibility in the market.

In 1999, in an attempt to clarify their current market position as more than a graphics company, Silicon Graphics Inc. changed its corporate identity to "SGI", although its legal name was unchanged.

At the same time, SGI announced a new logo consisting of only the letters "sgi" in a proprietary font called "SGI", created by branding and design consulting firm [[Landor Associates]], in collaboration with designer Joe Stitzlein. SGI continued to use the "Silicon Graphics" name for its workstation product line, and later re-adopted the cube logo for some workstation models.

In November 2005, SGI announced that it had been delisted from the [[New York Stock Exchange]] because its common stock had fallen below the minimum share price for listing on the exchange. SGI's [[market capitalization]] dwindled from a peak of over seven [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] dollars in 1995 to just $120 million at the time of delisting. In February 2006, SGI noted that it could run out of cash by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = SGI's Future Could Include Bankruptcy, Sale|url = http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1925129,00.asp|work = ExtremeTech|date = February 10, 2006|accessdate = November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-emergence===
In mid-2005, SGI hired Alix Partners to advise it on returning to profitability and received a new line of credit. SGI announced it was postponing its scheduled annual December stockholders meeting until March 2006. It proposed a reverse stock split to deal with the de-listing from the New York Stock Exchange.

In January 2006, SGI hired Dennis McKenna as its new CEO and chairman of the board of directors. Mr. McKenna succeeded [[Robert Bishop (manager)|Robert Bishop]], who remained vice chairman of the board of directors.

On May 8, 2006, SGI announced that it had filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection for itself and U.S. subsidiaries as part of a plan to reduce debt by $250 million.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114708367971646497 Silicon Graphics Seeks Chapter 11 As Sales Decline] Wall Street Journal, 2006.

Foreign subsidiaries were unaffected.

On September 6, 2006, SGI announced the end of development for the MIPS/IRIX line and the IRIX operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.com/support/mips_irix.html |title=End of General Availability for MIPS IRIX Products |accessdate=May 2, 2009 |publisher=Silicon Graphics |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426090853/http://www.sgi.com/support/mips_irix.html |archivedate=April 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production would end on December 29 and the last orders would be fulfilled by March 2007. Support for these products would end after December 2013.

SGI emerged from bankruptcy protection on October 17, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sgi.com/features/2006/october/growth/| title = SGI Emerges Lean, Focused and Ready to Grow| accessdate = January 25, 2007| work = SGI Web site}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its stock symbol at that point, ''SGID.pk'', was canceled, and new stock was issued on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol ''SGIC''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

In April 2008, SGI re-entered the visualization market with the [[SGI Virtu]] range of visualization servers and workstations, which were re-badged systems from BOXX Technologies based on Intel [[Xeon]] or [[AMD Opteron]] processors and [[Nvidia Quadro]] graphics chipsets, running [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] or [[Windows Server 2003#Windows Compute Cluster Server|Windows Compute Cluster Server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcwire.com/features/Back_to_the_Future_SGI_Returns_to_Visualization.html|title=Back to the Future: SGI Returns to Visualization|date=April 11, 2008|work=HPCwire|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final bankruptcy and acquisition by Rackable Systems===
In December 2008, SGI received a delisting notification from [[NASDAQ]], as its market value had been below the minimum $35 million requirement for 10 consecutive trading days, and also did not meet NASDAQ's alternative requirements of a minimum stockholders' equity of $2.5 million or annual net income from continuing operations of $500,000 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2009, SGI filed for Chapter 11 again, and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to [[Rackable Systems]] for $25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url = http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2009/april/rackable.html|title = Rackable Systems Announces Agreement to Acquire Silicon Graphics Inc.|accessdate = April 1, 2009|date = April 1, 2009|publisher = Silicon Graphics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale, ultimately for $42.5 million, was finalized on May 11, 2009; at the same time, Rackable announced their adoption of "Silicon Graphics International" as their global name and brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

After the Rackable acquisition, ''Vizworld'' magazine published [http://www.vizworld.com/tag/sgi-bts// a series of six articles that chronicle the downfall of SGI.]

===Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc. era===
During the Silicon Graphics Inc.'s second bankruptcy phase, it was renamed to Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc.(GPHI) in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/091110/Graphics-Properties-Holdings-Inc_8-K/|title=Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc. - FORM 8-K - November 10, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=34343|title=Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc.: Private Company Information - Businessweek|work=Businessweek.com|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, GPHI announced it had won a significant favorable ruling in its litigation with ATI Technologies and AMD in June 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2010/11/former-sgi-files-patent-infringement-lawsuit-against-apple.html|title=Former SGI Files Patent Infringement Lawsuit against Apple - Patently Apple|publisher=|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cafc/08-1334/08-1334-2011-03-27.pdf|title=United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit SILICON GRAPHICS, INC., Plaintiff-Cross Appellant, v.

In 2011-11, GPHI filed another patent infringement lawsuit against Apple Inc. in Delaware involving more patents than their original patent infringement case against Apple last November, for alleged violation of U.S. patents 6,650,327 ('327), {{US patent|6,816,145}} ('145) and {{US patent|5,717,881}} ('881).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2011/11/its-war-former-sgi-surprises-apple-with-another-patent-infringement-lawsuit.html|title=It's War: Former SGI Surprises Apple with another Patent Infringement Lawsuit - Patently Apple|publisher=|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the GPHI filed lawsuit against Apple, Sony, HTC Corp, LG Electronics Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., Research in Motion Ltd. for allegedly violating patent relating to a computer graphics process that turns text and images into pixels to be displayed on screens.

SGI's first generation products, starting with the [[SGI IRIS|IRIS]] (Integrated Raster Imaging System) 1000 series of high-performance graphics terminals, were based on the [[Motorola 68000]] family of [[microprocessor]]s. The later IRIS 2000 and 3000 models developed into full [[UNIX]] [[workstation]]s.

====IRIS 1000 series====
The first entries in the 1000 series (models 1000 and 1200, introduced in 1984) were graphics terminals, peripherals to be connected to a general-purpose computer such as a [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX]], to provide graphical [[raster graphics|raster display]] abilities. They used 8&amp;nbsp;MHz Motorola 68000 CPUs with {{nowrap|768 kB}} of RAM and had no [[disk drive]]s. They booted over the network (via an [[Excelan]] EXOS/101 Ethernet card) from their controlling computer. They used the "PM1" CPU board, which was a variant of the board that was used in [[Stanford University]]'s [[SUN workstation]] and later in the [[Sun-1]] workstation from [[Sun Microsystems]]. The graphics system was composed of the GF1 [[frame buffer]], the UC3 "Update Controller", DC3 "Display Controller", and the BP2 bitplane. The 1000-series machines were designed around the [[Multibus]] standard.

Later 1000-series machines, the 1400 and 1500, ran at 10&amp;nbsp;MHz and had 1.5 MB of RAM. The 1400 had a 73 MB [[ST-506]] disk drive, while the 1500 had a 474 MB SMD-based disk drive with a [[Xylogics]] 450 disk controller. They may have used the PM2 CPU and PM2M1 RAM board from the 2000 series. The usual monitor for the 1000 series ran at 30&amp;nbsp;Hz [[interlaced]]. Six beta-test units of the 1400 workstation were produced, and the first production unit (SGI's first commercial computer) was shipped to Carnegie-Mellon University's Electronic Imaging Laboratory in 1984.

====IRIS 2000 and 3000 series====
[[File:SGI-geometry-engine-chip.jpg|thumb|Geometry Engine chip from an IRIS 3120]]
SGI rapidly developed its machines into workstations with its second product line — the IRIS 2000 series, first released in August 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Iris 2000 Systems| publisher = SGIstuff.net|author= Gerhard Lenerz| url = http://www.sgistuff.net/hardware/systems/iris2000.html | accessdate = January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SGI began using the [[UNIX System V]] [[operating system]]. There were five models in two product ranges, the 2000/2200/2300/2400/2500 range which used [[Motorola 68010|68010 CPUs]] (the PM2 CPU module), and the later "Turbo" systems, the 2300T, 2400T and 2500T, which had [[Motorola 68020|68020s]] (the IP2 CPU module). All used the Excelan EXOS/201 Ethernet card, the same graphics hardware (GF2 Frame Buffer, UC4 Update Controller, DC4 Display Controller, BP3 Bitplane). Their main differences were the CPU, RAM, and [[Weitek]] [[Math coprocessor|Floating Point Accelerator]] boards, disk controllers and disk drives (both [[ST-506]] and [[Storage Module Device|SMD]] were available).  These could be upgraded, for example from a 2400 to a 2400T. The 2500 and 2500T had a larger chassis, a standard 6' 19" EIA rack with space at the bottom for two SMD disk drives weighing approximately {{nowrap|68 kg}} each.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/sgi/iris/IRIS_FAQ.txt&lt;/ref&gt; The non-Turbo models used the [[Multibus]] for the CPU to communicate with the floating point accelerator, while the Turbos added a ribbon cable dedicated for this. 60&amp;nbsp;Hz monitors were used for the 2000 series.

The height of the machines using Motorola CPUs was reached with the IRIS 3000 series (models 3010/3020/3030 and 3110/3115/3120/3130, the 30s both being full-size rack machines). They used the same graphics subsystem and Ethernet as the 2000s, but could also use up to 12 "geometry engines", the first widespread use of hardware graphics accelerators. The standard monitor was a 19" 60&amp;nbsp;Hz non-interlaced unit with a tilt/swivel base; 19" 30&amp;nbsp;Hz interlaced and a 15" 60&amp;nbsp;Hz non-interlaced (with tilt/swivel base) were also available.

The IRIS 3130 and its smaller siblings were impressive for the time, being complete [[UNIX]] workstations. The 3130 was powerful enough to support a complete 3D animation and rendering package without mainframe support. With large capacity hard drives by standards of the day (two 300 MB drives), streaming tape and Ethernet, it could be the centerpiece of an animation operation.

The line was formally discontinued in November 1989, with about 3500 systems shipped of all 2000 and 3000 models combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silicon Graphics IRIS 2000/3000 FAQ|author=Jonathan Levine|url=http://www.sgistuff.net/mirrors/irisfaq/index.php |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RISC era===
With the introduction of the IRIS 4D series, SGI switched to [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] microprocessors. These machines were more powerful and came with powerful on-board floating-point capability. As 3D graphics became more popular in television and film during this time, these systems were responsible for establishing much of SGI's reputation.

SGI produced a broad range of MIPS-based workstations and servers during the 1990s, running SGI's version of UNIX System V, now called [[IRIX]]. These included the massive Onyx visualization systems, the size of refrigerators and capable of supporting up to 64 processors while managing up to three streams of high resolution, fully realized 3D graphics.

In October 1991, MIPS announced the first commercially available [[64-bit]] microprocessor, the [[R4000]]. SGI used the R4000 in its [[SGI Crimson|Crimson]] workstation. IRIX 6.2 was the first fully 64-bit IRIX release, including 64-bit pointers.

To secure the supply of future generations of MIPS microprocessors (the 64-bit [[R4000]]), SGI acquired the company in 1992&lt;ref&gt;PC Magazine. "[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=SGI&amp;i=51221,00.asp SGI]." Retrieved September 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; for $333 million&lt;ref name=CHM&gt;Computer History Museum.

Retrieved September 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and renamed it as MIPS Technologies Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGI.&lt;ref&gt;Cate Corcoran (March 16, 1992), MIPS, Silicon merger could kill ACE/ARC, InfoWorld,  p. 107. Retrieved September 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Silicon Graphics (SGI) signed a deal with [[Nintendo]] to develop the CPU used in the [[Nintendo 64]], a derivative of the [[R4300i]] microprocessor. Though the deal was signed in early 1993, it was not made public until August of that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=75 Power Players: The Outsiders|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the console itself would not be released until 1996.

In 1998, SGI relinquished some ownership of MIPS Technologies, Inc in a [[Reverse IPO|Re-IPO]], and fully divested itself in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SGI and MIPS Technologies Announce Spin-Off of MIPS Shares. - Free Online Library|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/SGI+and+MIPS+Technologies+Announce+Spin-Off+of+MIPS+Shares.-a062436955|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, when much of the industry expected the [[Itanium]] to replace both [[Complex instruction set computing|CISC]] and [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] architectures in non-embedded computers, SGI announced their intent to phase out MIPS in their systems. Development of new MIPS microprocessors stopped, and the existing [[R12000]] design was extended multiple times until 2003 to provide existing customers more time to migrate to Itanium.

In August 2006, SGI announced the end of production for MIPS/IRIX systems,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.sgi.com/support/mips_irix.html End of General Availability for MIPS IRIX Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307153053/http://www.sgi.com/support/mips_irix.html |date=March 7, 2008 }} at sgi.com&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of the year MIPS/IRIX products were no longer generally available from SGI.

===IRIS GL and OpenGL===
Until the second generation Onyx [[RealityEngine|Reality Engine]] machines, SGI offered access to its high performance 3D graphics subsystems through a proprietary [[Application programming interface|API]] known as ''IRIS Graphics Language'' ([[IRIS GL]]). As more features were added over the years, IRIS GL became harder to maintain and more cumbersome to use. In 1992, SGI decided to clean up and reform IRIS GL and made the bold move of allowing the resulting [[OpenGL]] API to be cheaply licensed by SGI's competitors, and set up an industry-wide consortium to maintain the OpenGL standard (the OpenGL Architecture Review Board).

This meant that for the first time, fast, efficient, cross-platform graphics programs could be written.  To this day, OpenGL remains the only real-time 3D graphics standard to be portable across a variety of operating systems. OpenGL-ES even runs on many types of cell phones.  Its main competitor ([[Direct3D]] from Microsoft) runs only on [[Microsoft Windows]]-based machines and some consoles.

===ACE Consortium===
{{main|Advanced Computing Environment}}
SGI was part of the Advanced Computing Environment initiative, formed in the early 1990s with 20 other companies, including [[Compaq]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[MIPS Computer Systems]], [[Groupe Bull]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[NEC Corporation|NEC]], [[NeTpower]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Santa Cruz Operation]].  Its intent was to introduce workstations based on the [[MIPS architecture]] and able to run [[Windows NT]] and [[SCO UNIX]]. The group produced the [[Advanced RISC Computing]] (ARC) specification, but began to unravel little more than a year after its formation.

===Entertainment industry===
An [[SGI Crimson]] system with the [[fsn (file manager)|fsn]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconbunny.com/fsn-the-irix-3d-file-system-tool-from-jurassic-park/ FSN — File System Navigator] at siliconbunny.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] file system navigator appeared in the 1993 movie ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgistuff.net/funstuff/hollywood/jpark.html|title=sgistuff.net|author=Gerhard Lenerz|publisher=|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the movie ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', protagonists can be seen using an SGI laptop computer, however the unit shown was not an actual working computer, but rather a fake laptop shell built around an SGI Corona LCD flat screen display.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bftr.com/Pages/projects/twister.html Banned From the Ranch Entertainment&amp;nbsp;— Twister] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820193238/http://www.bftr.com/Pages/projects/twister.html |date=August 20, 2008 }} at bftr.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 film ''[[Congo (film)|Congo]]'' also features an SGI laptop computer being used by Dr. Ross ([[Laura Linney]]) to communicate via satellite to TraviCom HQ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconbunny.com/silicon-graphics-laptops/ SGI Laptops] at siliconbunny.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The purple, lowercased "'''sgi'''" logo can be seen at the beginning of the opening credits of the [[HBO]] series [[Silicon Valley (TV series)|''Silicon Valley'']], before being taken down and replaced by the [[Google]] logo as the intro graphics progress. Google leased the former SGI buildings in 2003 for their headquarters in Mountain View, CA until they purchased the buildings outright in 2006.

For eight consecutive years (1995–2002), all films nominated for an Academy Award for Distinguished Achievement in Visual Effects were created on Silicon Graphics computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/news/video_sgi_sweeps_academy|title=News, Features, Reviews, Forums and Resources for the Professional Content Creator - Creative Planet Network|author=|date=|website=Creative Planet Network|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once inexpensive PCs began to have graphics performance close to the more expensive specialized graphical workstations which were SGI's core business, SGI shifted its focus to high performance servers for [[digital video]] and the Web. Many SGI graphics engineers left to work at other computer graphics companies such as [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] and [[Nvidia]], contributing to the PC 3D graphics revolution.

===Free software===
SGI was a promoter of [[free software]],{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} supporting several projects such as [[Linux (kernel)|Linux]] and [[Samba software|Samba]], and opening some of its own previously proprietary code such as the [[XFS]] filesystem and the [[Open64]] compiler.

===Acquisition of Alias, Wavefront, Cray and Intergraph===
In 1995, SGI purchased Alias Research, [[Kroyer Films]], and [[Wavefront Technologies]] in a deal totaling approximately $500 million and merged the companies into Alias|Wavefront. In June 2004 SGI sold the business, later renamed to  [[Alias Systems Corporation|Alias/Wavefront]], to the private equity investment firm [[Accel-KKR]] for $57.1 million. In October 2005, [[Autodesk]] announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Alias for $182 million in cash.

In February 1996, SGI purchased the well-known [[supercomputer]] manufacturer [[Cray Research]] for $740 million,&lt;ref&gt;David Einstein, [https://www.forbes.com/2000/03/03/mu4.html Could SGI Be A Takeover Target?]  Forbes, March 2000.
&lt;/ref&gt; and began to use marketing names such as "CrayLink" for (SGI-developed) technology integrated into the SGI server line. Three months later, it sold Cray's Business Systems Division, responsible for the [[CS6400]] SPARC/Solaris server, to [[Sun Microsystems]] for an undisclosed amount (widely believed to be $50 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

  |accessdate= March 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[Cray T3E]] engineers designed and developed the [[SGI Altix]] and [[NUMAlink]] technology.  SGI sold the Cray brand and product lines to [[Tera Computer Company]] on March 31, 2000 for $35 million plus one million shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2002/11/18/focus2.html | first=M. Sharon | last=Baker | title=Cray is making a name for itself in the world of supercomputers | date=November 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; SGI also distributed its remaining interest in MIPS Technologies through a spin-off effective June 20, 2000.

In September 2000, SGI acquired the Zx10 series of Windows workstations and servers from [[Intergraph| Intergraph Computer Systems]] (for a rumored $100 million). These models were rebadged as SGI systems, but discontinued in June 2001.

===SGI Visual Workstations===
Another attempt by SGI in the late 1990s to introduce its own family of Intel-based workstations running [[Windows NT]] or [[Red Hat Linux]] (see also [[SGI Visual Workstation]]) proved to be a financial disaster, and shook customer confidence in SGI’s commitment to its own MIPS-based line.

===Switch to Itanium===
In 1998, SGI announced that future generations of its machines would be based not on their own MIPS processors, but the upcoming "super-chip" from [[Intel]], code-named "Merced" and later called [[Itanium]]. Funding for its own high-end processors was reduced, and it was planned that the [[R10000]] would be the last MIPS mainstream processor. [[MIPS Technologies]] would focus entirely on the embedded market, where it was having some success, and SGI would no longer have to fund development of a CPU that, since the failure of [[Advanced RISC Computing|ARC]], found use only in their own machines.  This plan quickly went awry. As early as 1999 it was clear the Itanium was going to be delivered very late and would have nowhere near the performance originally expected. As the production delays increased, MIPS' existing R10000-based machines grew increasingly uncompetitive. Eventually it was forced to introduce faster MIPS processors, the [[R10000#R12000|R12000]], [[R10000#R14000|R14000]] and [[R10000#R16000|R16000]], which were used in a series of models from 2002 through 2006.

SGI's first Itanium-based system was the short-lived SGI 750 workstation, launched in 2001. SGI's MIPS-based systems were not to be superseded until the launch of the [[Itanium 2]]-based [[SGI Altix|Altix]] servers and [[SGI Prism|Prism]] workstations some time later. Unlike the MIPS systems, which ran [[IRIX]], the Itanium systems used [[SuSE Linux|SuSE Linux Enterprise Server]] with SGI enhancements as their [[operating system]]. SGI used [[Transitive Corporation]]'s [[QuickTransit]] software to allow their old MIPS/IRIX applications to run (in emulation) on the new Itanium/Linux platform.

In the server market the Itanium 2-based Altix eventually replaced the MIPS-based Origin product line. In the workstation market, the switch to Itanium was not completed before SGI exited the market.

The Altix was the most powerful computer in the world in 2006, assuming that a "computer" is defined as a collection of hardware running under a single instance of an operating system. The Altix had 512 Itanium processors running under a single instance of [[Linux]]. A cluster of 20 machines was then the eighth-fastest [[supercomputer]]. All faster supercomputers were clusters, but none have as many [[FLOPS]] per machine. However, more recent supercomputers are very large clusters of machines that are individually less capable. SGI acknowledged this and in 2007 moved away from the "massive [[Non-Uniform Memory Access|NUMA]]" model to clusters.

===Switch to Xeon===
Although SGI continued to market Itanium-based machines, its more recent machines were based on the Intel [[Xeon]] processor. The first Altix XE systems were relatively low-end machines, but by December 2006 the XE systems were more capable than the Itanium machines by some measures (e.g., power consumption in FLOPS/W, density in FLOPS/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, cost/FLOPS).  The XE1200 and XE1300 servers used a cluster architecture. This was a departure from the pure NUMA architectures of the earlier Itanium and MIPS servers.

In June 2007, SGI announced the Altix ICE 8200, a blade-based Xeon system with up to 512 Xeon cores per rack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title = SGI Unveils Ultra-Dense SGI Altix ICE Blade Platform Purpose-Built for High-Performance Computing| publisher = SGI| date = June 26, 2006| url = http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2007/june/altix_ice.html| accessdate = November 26, 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022072329/http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2007/june/altix_ice.html| archivedate = October 22, 2007| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; An Altix ICE 8200 installed at New Mexico Computing Applications Center (with 14336 processors) ranked at number 3 on the [[TOP500]] list of November 2007.

==User base and core market==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
Conventional wisdom holds that SGI's core market has traditionally been [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] visual effects studios. In fact, SGI's largest [[revenue]] has always been generated by government and defense applications, energy, and scientific and technical computing.&lt;ref&gt;Silicon Graphics [http://www.sgi.com/company_info/federal/sewp.html "SGI SEWP Contracts"] Retrieved November 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In one case Silicon Graphics largest single sale ever was to the United States Postal Services (USPS). SGI's servers powered an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Program to mechanically read, tag and sort the mail (hand-written and block) at a number of USPS's key mail centers. The rise of cheap yet powerful commodity workstations running [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]], and the availability of diverse professional software for them, effectively pushed SGI out of the visual effects industry in all but the most [[niche market]]s.

==High-end server market==
SGI continued to enhance its line of servers (including some [[supercomputer]]s) based on the [[SN architecture]]. SN, for Scalable Node, is a technology developed by SGI in the mid-1990s that uses [[Non-Uniform Memory Access#Cache coherent NUMA (ccNUMA)|cache-coherent non-uniform memory access]] (cc-NUMA). In an SN system, processors, memory, and a bus- and memory-controller are coupled together into an entity called a node, usually on a single [[circuit board]]. Nodes are connected by a high-speed interconnect called [[NUMAlink]] (originally marketed as [[CrayLink]]). There is no [[internal bus]], and instead access between processors, memory, and [[I/O]] devices is done through a [[switched fabric]] of links and [[router (computing)|router]]s.

Thanks to the cache coherence of the [[distributed shared memory]], SN systems scale along several axes at once: as CPU count increases, so does memory capacity, I/O capacity, and system [[bisection bandwidth]]. This allows the combined memory of all the nodes to be accessed under a single [[Operating system|OS]] image using standard [[shared-memory synchronization]] methods. This makes an SN system far easier to program and able to achieve higher sustained-to-peak performance than non-cache-coherent systems like conventional [[cluster computing|clusters]] or [[massively parallel computer]]s which require applications code to be written (or re-written) to do explicit [[message-passing]] communication between their nodes.

The first SN system, known as SN-0, was released in 1996 under the product name [[SGI Origin 2000|Origin 2000]]. Based on the MIPS [[R10000]] processor, it scaled from 2 to 128 processors and a smaller version, the [[SGI Origin 200|Origin 200]] (SN-00), scaled from 1 to 4. Later enhancements enabled systems of as large as 512 processors.

The second generation system, originally called SN-1 but later SN-MIPS, was released in July 2000, as the [[Origin 3000]]. It scaled from 4 to 512 processors, and 1,024-processor configurations were delivered by special order to some customers. A smaller, less scalable implementation followed, called Origin 300.

In November 2002, SGI announced a repackaging of its SN system, under the name Origin 3900. It quadrupled the processor area density of the SN-MIPS system, from 32 up to 128 processors per rack while moving to a "[[fat tree]]" interconnect topology.

In January 2003, SGI announced a variant of the SN platform called the [[Altix|Altix 3000]] (internally called SN-IA). It used [[Intel]] [[Itanium]] 2 processors and ran the [[Linux]] operating system kernel. At the time it was released, it was the world's most scalable Linux-based computer, supporting up to 64 processors in a single system node.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6440 Scaling Linux to New Heights: the SGI Altix 3000 System] Linux Journal, January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Nodes could be connected using the same [[NUMAlink]] technology to form what SGI predictably termed "superclusters".

In February 2004, SGI announced general support for 128 processor nodes to be followed by 256 and 512 processor versions that year.

In April 2004, SGI announced the sale of its Alias software business for approximately $57 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

In October 2004, SGI built the supercomputer [[Columbia (supercomputer)|Columbia]], which broke the world record for computer speed, for the [[NASA Ames]] Research Center. It was a cluster of 20 [[SGI Altix|Altix supercomputers]] each with 512 Intel Itanium 2 processors running Linux, and achieved sustained speed of 42.7 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] floating-point operations per second ([[FLOPS|teraflops]]), easily topping [[Japan]]'s famed [[Earth Simulator]]'s record of 35.86 teraflops. (A week later, [[IBM]]'s upgraded [[Blue Gene]]/L clocked in at 70.7 teraflops).

In July 2006, SGI announced an SGI Altix 4700 system with 1,024 processors and 4 [[terabyte|TB]] of memory running a single Linux system image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1883">'''Songshark''' is a term for a dishonest [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]], whose main source of income is the naivete of new [[songwriter]]s, whom they charge for services a reputable publisher would provide free to their clients.&lt;ref name="Billboard 1918 Feb 16" /&gt;

"Song shark" is the trade name for any individual, or firm who, with the deliberate intention to defraud, solicits business from amateur songwriters, advising them that by having music written to their lyrics, or vice versa, they will have a finished composition which will immediately be "snatched up" by a music publisher. Often, the song shark will himself claim to be a publisher, and will tell the songwriter that his only expense will be in "defraying half the costs of publication."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7062">A '''special effects supervisor''' (also referred to as a '''special effects coordinator''' or '''SFX Supervisor''') is an individual who works on a [[television advertisement|commercial]], [[theater]], [[television]] or [[film]] set creating [[special effects]]. The supervisor generally is the department head who defers to the film's director and/or producers, and who is in charge of the entire special effects team. Special effects include anything that is manual or mechanically manipulated (also called "[[practical effect]]s" or [[in camera]] effects).&lt;ref name="Jobs"&gt;[http://www.media-match.com/jobtypes/job-descriptions.php Media Match "TV and Film Job Descriptions"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/glossary/S IMDB Glossary letter "S": Special Effects Supervisor]&lt;/ref&gt; This may include the use of mechanized [[Theatrical property|props]], special effects makeup, [[theatrical property|props]], [[theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[scale model]]s, [[pyrotechnics]] and atmospheric effects: creating physical wind, rain, fog, snow, clouds etc.

Special effects (SFX) or (SPFX) are produced on the set, as opposed to those created in post-production which are generally called "visual effects" (VFX). In recent years real physical special effects have been increasingly overshadowed by [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) effects created in [[post-production]]."&lt;ref name="Jobs" /&gt;

Some examples of special effects are explosions, car crashes and chases, gunshots, earthquake effects, special makeup, prosthetics, special set construction, snow and rain.

'''Special Effects Technician''' is a person working in the [[special effects]] department, under the special effects supervisor, and he is responsible for creating and assisting special effects. Major motion pictures, with many special effects many have many special effects technicians.

==Skills==

A special effects supervisor has to ensure the safety of his/her crew and everyone else on set.&lt;ref name="Special"&gt;[http://getinmedia.com/careers/special-effects-supervisor Special Effects Supervisor]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the cameras start rolling, local officials may step onto set and perform inspections, so knowledge of the law and safety protocols helps when using explosives and firearms during the production process.&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; Specific education programs are recommended for one to gain high awareness in health and safety. Other training in various fields such as handling explosives, firearms, high voltage and other hazardous material and equipment helps.&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; One should be familiar with all the necessary equipment such as wind, snow, fog, fire and rain machines, as well as dummies and body parts. On set, the supervisor is the one in charge of setting up and operating these gears. Creativity and imagination plays a big role in this occupation, for he/she is the one responsible to see the big picture of the script and know when and how a special effect should be implemented. He/she should have the ability to visualize how things will appear ‘on screen.’&lt;ref name="Education"&gt;[http://education-portal.com/special_effects_career.html Special Effects Career Information and Education Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt; Strong communication skills and presentation skills are an asset because being able to show such skills during the interview process proves personal responsibility and willing to collaborate with others.&lt;ref name="Work"&gt;[http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/special-effects-artist.htm How Special Effects Artists Work]&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the head of the entire special effects team works closely with the [[production designer]] and [[art director]].&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; The supervisor plans a special effects scene and presents it to the director, in hope that he/she will be pleased with the results. Experience in photography may be an advantage in this job because as the supervisor, he/she has to plan the camera angles when shooting special effects scenes. Starting young allows one to absorb all the information and experience you can get and applying them to become a special effects artist.&lt;ref name="Work" /&gt;

===Education===

Entry into this career path is competitive. There are various paths that one can take in order to become a special effects supervisor. People with [[animation]], [[computer science]], and [[industrial design]] backgrounds are seen.&lt;ref name="Work" /&gt; A formal education, particularly in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering is suggested. Some enter into this profession with a degree in film and television production, which is useful.&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; Some students may specialize in [[fine art]] or sculpture, which may enhance their techniques to apply to special effects careers in modeling, [[illustration]], [[animation]] and much more.&lt;ref name="Education" /&gt; Being good with computer software saves a company time and money to invest in training their new employees. Modern special effects tend to be computer generated nowadays, blending physical techniques and digital tricks.&lt;ref name="Work" /&gt; Taking classes related to computer graphics gives people insight on computer animation software that he/she may come into contact with. Several years of employment experience at the junior level is necessary before one takes on this senior-level role as a supervisor. [[Special effects]] are a form of science, so courses in [[Chemistry]], [[Physics]] and [[Biology]] are recommended.&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; To have an understanding in advanced mathematics allows preparing the department budget and crew scheduling easier.&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; Education in any of these fields gives a person valuable experience that he/she may be able to apply to their career.

'''Susan Stevenson Borowitz''' is an American writer and producer.  She is best known for her work on ''[[Family Ties]], [[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]], [[Aliens in the Family]]'', and [[Pleasantville (film)|''Pleasantville'']]''.'' During her marriage to writer and comedian, [[Andy Borowitz]] (1982–2005), the two co-created ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.'' This series ran from 1990–1996 and led to Will Smith's stardom.  It won NAACP's Image Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1993.&lt;ref name="Harvard Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Craig|title=April Fool Every Day|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2009/05/andy-borowitz|website=Harvard Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Susan and Andy co-created and produced many other television situation comedies.  Susan is the author of the comedic novel, ''When We’re in Public, Pretend You Don’t Know Me: Surviving Your Daughter's Adolescence So You Don't Look Like an Idiot and She Still Talks to You,'' published in 2003.&lt;ref name="Daily News" /&gt;

== Early life ==

Susan Stevenson was born on March 6, 1959 in Lower Merion, Pennsylvania.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} She knew from a young age that she was passionate about writing and story creation.  Both her parents, Robert Large Stevenson and Norma Willis Stevenson,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} were artists. As a result, there were many art artifacts scattered throughout Susan's family home. Growing up, she would often work on art projects, which later turned into illustrations in the form of books that she ultimately used to tell a story.  During her years in school, the written word became her story-telling medium of choice, although she did still enjoy drawing as a form of stress relief.  During her time in Hollywood, she still focused on visual arts to relieve her stress.  However, this time she shifted her focus on sewing and creating formal wear for her new Hollywood lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Signet Society"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borowitz|first1=Susan|title=Featured Drone: Susan Stevenson Borowitz '81|url=http://www.signetsociety.org/spring-2010-susan-stevenson/|website=Signet Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan graduated from [[Harvard University]], class of 1981 with a bachelor's degree in English Literature.  At Harvard, Susan further explored her interest in writing and believed she potentially wanted a career out of it. She hoped to exercise her writing in humor, which she favored, and did so by becoming an editor of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]''.&lt;ref name="Signet Society" /&gt; One of her articles has made it into the book, ''The Best of the Harvard Lampoon: 140 Years of American Humor'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySSzCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT165&amp;dq=susan+stevenson+borowitz+the+harvard+lampoon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnpPq6qPTQAhUBIpAKHYYsAMQQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=susan%20stevenson%20borowitz%20the%20harvard%20lampoon&amp;f=false|title=The Best of the Harvard Lampoon: 140 Years of American Humor|last=Lampoon|first=Harvard|publisher=Touchstone|date=November 15, 2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes passages from many Hollywood comedy writers before their careers took off. Eventually, writing for the ''Harvard Lampoon'' inspired her to branch out and write comedy as her career.  She began freelance writing for a few years, then made her way to the Hollywood realm of comedic writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.harvard.com/book/the_best_of_the_harvard_lampoon_140_years_of_american_humor/|title=The Best of the Harvard Lampoon: 140 Years of American Humor|last=Lampoon|first=Harvard|date=|website=Harvard Bookstore|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Her first big hit was her work on the popular sitcom, ''Family Ties'' (1982–1989). In four years, Susan worked her way from story editor up to producer.  Borowitz attributes her success and learning of the sitcom production trade to her mentor, [[Gary David Goldberg]] (the creator of ''Family Ties'').  She learned many things behind the scenes, such as directing and editing, but also the importance of set design and the visual factors that tie together to create a successful show.&lt;ref name="Signet Society" /&gt; She used these learned skills to help her write, produce, and co-create ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' with her husband at the time, Andy Borowitz.

=== Family Ties ===
''Family Ties'' ran from 1982-1989.  It was a situational comedy about Steven and Elyse Keaton, previous hippies in the 60's, who were attempting to raise their family in a normal suburban area.  Their oldest child, played by Michael J. Fox, had different views from their own. He was conservative, in contrast to his radical liberal parents. The series starred [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] and [[Meredith Baxter]] and won many awards including Golden Globes and Emmys.

=== The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ===
''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' was an instant hit and won many awards for its comedy aspects.  In addition to its 1993 NAACP's Image Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, it also won the Top TV Series at the ASCAP Film and Television Awards in 1994, in addition to many others.  Rapper at the time, [[Will Smith]], who went by "The Fresh Prince" kick-started his acting career by starring in the sitcom.&lt;ref name="Harvard Magazine" /&gt; Andy and Susan Borowitz wanted to relate Will's character as much to his personal life as possible.  The show not only focused on comedy, but also the life lessons of race, class, and family.  The Borowitz's wanted to be sure to highlight the race issue of blacks at the time, which is what inspired them to create the show in the first place. They hired black writers and crew members in order to be accurate in their depictions.&lt;ref name="Time Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waxman|first1=Olivia|title=The Fresh Prince Turns 25: The Show's Creators on Will Smith, Reboots and Race|url=http://time.com/4021944/quincy-jones-borowitz-fresh-prince-bel-air-anniversary/|website=Time Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air resulted in a change of pop culture with its popularity, influencing America on the vast lifestyles of all races.  It also successfully started many careers for other African American people inspiring networks and writers to further incorporate lead stars as being African American.&lt;ref name="Time Magazine" /&gt;

=== Out All Night ===
''Out All Night'' was co-created by Susan Borowitz, Andy Borowitz and [[Rob Edwards (screenwriter)|Rob Edwards]].  The Borowitz's were also executive producers.  The series starred [[Patti LaBelle]] and ran on NBC from September 1992 to July 1993.  LaBelle played a former singer who owned an L.A nightclub and the show focused on she managing "Club Chelsea" and her friends’ involvement in her life.

=== Aliens in the Family ===
''Aliens in the Family'' was created and executively produced by Susan and Andy Borowitz.  The ABC show premiered in March 1996 and ended in August 1996.  It was about a human single father (Grant Thatcher) falling in love with an alien mother (Sophie Bold) and their journey of living a normal life on earth.  Much of the comedic aspects in the sitcom stemmed from the physical appearance of the aliens and the interactions with the humans.

=== Pleasantville ===
Borowitz was a co-producer on the 1998 film, ''Pleasantville''.  It starred [[Reese Witherspoon]] and [[Tobey Maguire]] and encompassed their journey of going back in time trapped in a 1950s television show.

== Family ==
Susan and Andy Borowitz had two children together, a daughter and a son.  The family moved to New York City to raise the family, where Borowitz found it difficult to balance family while also maintain her job that was based 3,000 miles away.  She decided to spend her time raising her children.&lt;ref name="Signet Society" /&gt;  In 2003, she wrote the book, ''When We’re in Public, Pretend You Don’t Know Me: Surviving Your Daughter's Adolescence So You Don't Look Like an Idiot and She Still Talks to You,'' in order to capture her daughter's adolescence and as an outlet for other suburban mothers dealing with similar struggles.

== When We're in Public, Pretend You Don't Know Me ==
''When We’re in Public, Pretend You Don’t Know Me: Surviving Your Daughter's Adolescence So You Don't Look Like an Idiot and She Still Talks to You'' was Borowitz's first and only book thus far.  In it, she encourages fellow mothers to be the UnCool mom in a comedic way.  Much of the book consists of advice and inspiration to other moms in similar positions.

The '''Arriaga antzokia''' in Basque or '''Teatro Arriaga''' in Spanish is an [[opera house]] in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]]. It was built in [[Neo-baroque]] style by architect [[Joaquín Rucoba]] in 1890, the same architect that built the [[Bilbao City Hall|city hall]]. It is named after [[Juan Crisóstomo Arriaga|Juan Crisóstomo de Arriaga]], known in his time as the "Spanish Mozart".

The theater was rebuilt in 1985 after severe flooding destroyed it in August 1983.

'''''The Belly of an Architect''''' is a 1987 [[film]] drama written and directed by [[Peter Greenaway]], featuring original music by [[Glenn Branca]] and [[Wim Mertens]]. Starring [[Brian Dennehy]] and [[Chloe Webb]], it was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] (Golden Palm) award at the [[1987 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/422/year/1987.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Belly of an Architect |accessdate=2009-07-19|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The American architect Stourley Kracklite has been commissioned to construct an exhibition in Rome dedicated to the architecture of [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]]. Doubts arise among his Italian colleagues about the legitimacy of Boullée among the pantheon of famed architects, perhaps because Boullée was an inspiration for [[Adolf Hitler]]'s architect [[Albert Speer]].

Tirelessly dedicated to the project, Kracklite's marriage deteriorates, along with his health. His social and physical decline corresponds to the decline of his idol Boullée, who until the 20th century was hardly known. 

Kracklite becomes obsessed with the historical [[Caesar Augustus]] after hearing that Livia, his wife, supposedly poisoned him. Kracklite assumes that his own wife, Louisa, is trying to do the same because he is suffering increasing stomach pains.

She informs him that she is pregnant, and is sexually involved with the younger co-organiser of the exhibition. 

He discovers that he has a stomach cancer and has not long to live. The film ends at opening ceremony, which Kracklite watches from a higher vantage point. Louisa gives birth to their child, and Kracklite jumps to his death.

==Style==
Director Greenaway's visual technique heightens Kracklite's alienation. There are few close-up shots of the other actors beside Dennehy, who himself is dwarfed by the dominance of the Roman architecture surrounding him.

Greenaway's trademark historical reenactments also compose a major theme: many visual images of the film appear to replicate major 18th-century works of art and architecture. In addition there are subtle references to [[Isaac Newton]] and the law of gravity, perhaps alluding to Kracklite's own inability to escape the physical laws of mortality.

'''''The Black Cauldron''''' is a 1985 American [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[adventure film|adventure]] [[fantasy film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] in association with [[Silver Screen Partners|Silver Screen Partners II]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]].&lt;ref name="AFI" /&gt; The 25th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], it is loosely based on the first two books in ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]'' by [[Lloyd Alexander]], a series of five novels that are, in turn, based on [[Welsh mythology]].

Set in the mythical land of Prydain during the [[Early Middle Ages]], the film centers on the evil [[Horned King]] who hopes to secure an ancient magical cauldron that will aid him in his desire to conquer the world. He is opposed by a young pig keeper named [[Taran (character)|Taran]], the young princess [[Eilonwy]], the bard [[Fflewddur Fflam]], and a wild creature named [[Gurgi]] who seek to destroy the cauldron, to prevent the Horned King from ruling the world.

The film is directed by [[Ted Berman]] and [[Richard Rich (director)|Richard Rich]], who had directed Disney's previous animated film ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' in 1981, the first Disney animated film to be recorded in [[Dolby Stereo]]. It features the voices of Grant Bardsley, [[Susan Sheridan]], [[Freddie Jones]], [[Nigel Hawthorne]], [[John Byner]], and [[John Hurt]]. 

It was the first Disney animated film to receive a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|PG rating]] as well as the first Disney animated film to feature [[computer-generated imagery]].&lt;ref name=SlateRevisiting /&gt; The film was distributed theatrically through [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]] on July 24, 1985. With the budget of $44 million, it was the most expensive animated film ever made at the time. Earning $21.3 million domestically, it led to a loss for the studio, putting Walt Disney Feature Animation near bankruptcy. Due to its commercial failure, Disney did not release the film on home video until 1998.

==Plot==
&lt;!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. Current word count is 635 words.--&gt;
In the land of Prydain, [[Taran (character)|Taran]] is an "assistant pig-keeper" on the small farm of [[Caer Dallben]], home of [[Dallben]] the Enchanter. Dallben learns that the [[Horned King]] is searching for a mystical relic known as the Black Cauldron, which is capable of creating an invincible army of undead warriors, the "Cauldron-Born". Dallben fears the Horned King may try to steal his pig [[Hen Wen]], which has [[oracle|oracular powers]], and use her to locate the cauldron. Dallben directs Taran to take Hen Wen to safety; unfortunately, Taran's foolish daydreaming causes Hen Wen to be captured by the Horned King's forces.

Taran follows them to the Horned King's stronghold. Along the way, he encounters the small, pestering companion Gurgi, who joins Taran on his search. Frustrated by Gurgi's antics, Taran leaves the former to sneak into the castle and rescues Hen Wen, but although Hen Wen escapes from the castle, Taran is arrested and thrown into the dungeon. A fellow captive named [[Princess Eilonwy]] frees Taran as she is trying to make her own escape. In the [[Spiral Castle|catacombs beneath the castle]], Taran and Eilonwy discover the ancient burial chamber of a king, where Taran arms himself with [[Dyrnwyn|the king's sword]]. It contains magic that allows him effectively to fight the Horned King's minions and so to fulfill his dream of heroism. Along with a third prisoner, the comical, middle-aged bard Fflewddur Fflam, they escape from the castle and are soon reunited with Gurgi. Upon discovering that Taran has escaped, the Horned King orders his goblin companion Creeper to send the Gwythaints to follow Taran and bring him back alive.

Following Hen Wen's trail, the four stumble into the underground kingdom of the [[Fair Folk]] who reveal that Hen Wen is under their protection. When the cheerful, elderly King Eidilleg reveals that he knows where the cauldron is, Taran resolves to go destroy it himself. Eilonwy, Fflewddur, and Gurgi agree to join him and Eidilleg's obnoxious right-hand man [[Doli (fictional character)|Doli]] is assigned to lead them to the [[Marshes of Morva]] while the Fair Folk agree to escort Hen Wen safely back to Caer Dallben. At the marshes they learn that the cauldron is held by [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|three witches]]—the grasping Orddu, who acts as leader; the greedy Orgoch; and the more benevolent Orwen, who falls in love with Fflewddur at first sight, which causes a frightened Doli to abandon the group. Orddu agrees to trade the cauldron for Taran's sword, and he reluctantly agrees, although he knows that to yield it will cost his chance for heroism. Before vanishing, the witches reveal that the cauldron is indestructible, and that its power can only be broken by someone who climbs in under his own free will, which will kill him. Although Taran feels foolish for aspiring to destroy the cauldron alone, his companions show their belief in him; and it seems that Eilonwy and Taran will kiss. Suddenly, the celebration is interrupted by the Horned King's soldiers who have finally reached the marshes themselves. They seize the cauldron and arrest everyone but Gurgi, and take their prisoners back to the castle. The Horned King uses the cauldron to raise the dead and his Cauldron-born army begins to pour out into the world.

Gurgi manages to free the captives and Taran decides to cast himself into the cauldron, but Gurgi stops him and jumps into the cauldron himself. The undead army collapses. When the Horned King spots Taran at large, he infers the turn of events, says that Taran has interfered for the last time, and throws the youth toward the cauldron; however, the cauldron's magic is out of control. It consumes the Horned King in a tunnel of fire and blood, trapping him in the cauldron as well as destroying the castle, using up all its powers forever. The three witches come to recover the now-inert Black Cauldron. However, Taran has finally realized Gurgi's true friendship, and he persuades them to revive the wild thing in exchange for the cauldron, forcing him to give up his magical sword permanently. Fflewddur challenges the reluctant witches to demonstrate their powers by the revival, and upon hearing Fflewddur's remarks, the witches honor the request, restoring Gurgi back to life. After Gurgi is resurrected, he pushes Taran and Eilonwy into a kiss. The four friends then journey back to Caer Dallben where Dallben and Doli watch them in a vision created by Hen Wen, and Dallben finally praises Taran for his heroism despite the fact that he prefers to be a Pig-Boy.

==Production==

===Development===
Walt Disney Productions [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] Lloyd Alexander's five-volume series in 1971,&lt;ref name=SlateRevisiting /&gt; and pre-production work began in 1973 when the film rights to Alexander's books were finally obtained. According to [[Ollie Johnston]], it was he and [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] that convinced the studio to produce the movie, and that if it had been done properly, it might be "as good as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject-link=[[Ollie Johnston]] |interviewer=Jo Jürgens |title=Ollie Johnston - an interview, part 1 |url=http://www.norskanimasjon.no/pub/index.php/ffaf/artikler/ollie_johnston_et_intervju_del_1 | language=Norwegian | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the numerous storylines and with over thirty characters in the original series, several story artists and animators worked on the development of the film throughout the 1970s,&lt;ref name=D23&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906012122/https://d23.com/a-to-z/black-cauldron-the-film/|url=https://d23.com/a-to-z/black-cauldron-the-film/|title=Black Cauldron, The (film)|work=[[Disney D23]]|archivedate=September 6, 2015|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was originally slated for release in 1980. Veteran artist [[Mel Shaw]] created inspirational conceptual pastel sketches in which then-Disney CEO [[Ron W. Miller]] considered to be too advanced for the animators.&lt;ref name=JHMWhatWentWrong /&gt; Therefore, in August 1978, the studio pushed its release date back to Christmas 1984 due to the animators' inability of animating realistic human characters; its original release date would later be assumed by ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harmetz|first=Aljean|authorlink=Aljean Harmetz|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19780810&amp;id=9AZFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6uEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7122,2605529&amp;hl=en|title=Disney film far behind schedule|work=The New York Times|publisher=[[The Register-Guard|Eugene Register-Guard]]|date=August 10, 1978|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its development limbo, one of those writers was veteran storyboard artist Vance Gerry who was chosen to create beat storyboards that would outline the plot, action, and locations. Having set up the three principal characters, Gerry adapted the Horned King into a big-bellied Viking who had a red beard, fiery temper, and wore a steel helmet with two large horns. Desiring an experienced British screenwriter to write the screenplay, the studio signed [[Rosemary Anne Sisson]] onto the project.{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=46}}

The first director attached to the project was animator [[John Musker]] after he was proposed the job by production head Tom Wilhite. As director, Musker was assigned to expand several sequences in the first act, but they were eventually deemed too comedic. When production on ''The Fox and the Hound'' had wrapped, several feature animation directors [[Art Stevens]], [[Richard Rich (director)|Richard Rich]], [[Ted Berman]], and Dave Michener became involved in ''The Black Cauldron''.

===Test-screening and editing===
Shortly before the film's initially planned 1984 theatrical release, a test screening for the rough cut of ''The Black Cauldron'' was held at the studio's private theater in Burbank, California. After the film, particularly the climactic "cauldron born" sequence, proved to be too intense and frightening for the majority of the children in the audience (most of whom fled the theater in terror before it was even finished), the newly appointed Disney studio chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] ordered certain scenes from ''The Black Cauldron'' be cut, as a result of the length and the fear that their graphic nature would alienate children and family audiences.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68–70}} Since animated films were generally edited in [[storyboard]] form using [[Leica reel]]s (later known as [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]]: storyboards shot sequentially and set to temporary audio tracks), producer Joe Hale objected to Katzenberg's demands. Katzenberg responded by having the film brought into an edit bay and editing the film himself.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68–70}}

Informed of what Katzenberg was doing by Hale, Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] called Katzenberg in the editing room and convinced him to stop. Though he did what Eisner insisted, Katzenberg requested that the film be modified, and delayed its scheduled Christmas 1984 release to July 1985 so that the film could be reworked.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68–70}}

The film was ultimately cut by twelve minutes,&lt;ref name="peraza"/&gt;, with existing scenes rewritten and reanimated for continuity.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68–70}} Many of the cut scenes involved extended character interactions, but other trims involve violent content, including the undead "Cauldron Born", who are used as the Horned King's army in the final act of the film. While most of the scenes were seamlessly removed from the film, the Cauldron Born sequence contains rather recognizable lapses because the removal of the scenes of the Cauldron Born mauling the henchmen, as well as one of them being dissolved by the mist, creates a jump in the film's soundtrack.&lt;ref name=SlateRevisiting /&gt;

===Animation===
Invented by David W. Spencer from the studio's still camera department,&lt;ref name=APT&gt;{{cite web|title=Animation photo transfer process|url=https://d23.com/a-to-z/animation-photo-transfer-process/|work=Disney D23|accessdate=May 11, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906122901/https://d23.com/a-to-z/animation-photo-transfer-process/|archivedate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[animation photo transfer process]] (shorten as the APT process) was first used for ''The Black Cauldron'' which would enhance the technology by which the rough animation would be processed onto [[cel]]luloid. First, the rough animation would be photographed onto high-contrast [[Photolithography|litho film]], and the resulting negative would be copied onto the plastic cel sheets that would transfer lines and the colors which eventually eliminated the hand-inking process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204150644/http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/movies/blackcauldron/blackcauldron.html|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/movies/blackcauldron/blackcauldron.html|title=The Black Cauldron|publisher=[[Go.com|Disney.go.com]]|archivedate=February 4, 2007|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as the APT-transferred line art would fade off of the cels over time, most or all of the film was done using the [[xerographic]] process which had been in place at Disney since the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="d2G"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706132307/http://www.drawn2gether.com/blog/2008/04/24/crew-picture-ink-and-paint-scene-planning-checking/|url=http://www.drawn2gether.com/blog/2008/04/24/crew-picture-ink-and-paint-scene-planning-checking/|title=The Black Cauldron|date=April 24, 2008|archivedate=July 6, 2008|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer would win a technical Academy Award for this process, but the computer would soon render the APT process obsolete.&lt;ref name=APT /&gt;

''The Black Cauldron'' is notable for being Disney's first animated feature film to incorporate [[computer-generated imagery]] in its animation for bubbles, a boat, a floating orb of light, and the cauldron itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Disney Films|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|author-link=Leonard Maltin|edition=3rd|year=1995|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=0-7868-8137-2|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite ''The Black Cauldron'' being released a year before ''The Great Mouse Detective'', both films were in production simultaneously for some time and the computer graphics for the latter were done first. When producer Joe Hale heard about what was being done, the possibilities made him excited and he made the crew from ''The Great Mouse Detective'' project create some computer animation for his own movie. For other effects, animator Don Paul used live action footage of dry ice mists to create the steam and smoke coming out of the cauldron.&lt;ref name="peraza"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelperaza.blogspot.com/2010/09/cauldron-of-chaos-part-3.html|title=Cauldron of Chaos, PART 3 - Ink and Paint Club: Memories of the House of Mouse|publisher=Peraza, Michael|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Black Cauldron: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' is the soundtrack album to the film. It was composed and conducted by [[Elmer Bernstein]] and originally released in 1985.

===Composition===
Unlike most other Disney animated films, the film did not contain any songs. At the same time, Bernstein had just come off the success of his [[Academy Award]]-nominated score for the 1983 film ''[[Trading Places]]'' as well as the score for the 1984 film ''[[Ghostbusters]]''. Like in the latter of the two, ''The Black Cauldron'' saw the use of the ghostly [[ondes Martenot]] to build upon the dark mood of Prydain.&lt;ref name="filmtracks"&gt;{{cite web|title =Filmtracks: The Black Cauldron (Elmer Bernstein)|publisher=[[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]]|date=May 12, 2012|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/black_cauldron.html|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original release===
Because of the film's last minute revisions, much of Bernstein's score was cut and unused.&lt;ref name="filmtracks"/&gt; In its minority, the score was re-recorded for the album original release by [[Varèse Sarabande]] in 1985, with the composer conducting the [[Utah Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="filmtracks"/&gt; The album soon fell out of print and many of the film's tracks did not resurface until a bootleg copy entitled "Taran" was supplied to soundtrack specialty outlets in 1986.&lt;ref name="filmtracks"/&gt;

===Re-release===
The film tracks received their premiere release in 2012 as part of [[Intrada Records]] partnership with [[Walt Disney Records]] to issue several Disney films soundtracks.&lt;ref name="intrada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Intrada Records: The Black Cauldron|publisher=[[Intrada Records]]|url=http://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.7514/.f|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The score received positive reviews from [[Music criticism|music critics]], and today is regarded as one of the best works by Bernstein and for a Disney animated film, despite its obscurity. Jason Ankeny from [[AllMusic]] gave to the soundtrack a positive review, stating that "Bernstein's bleak arrangements and ominous melodies vividly underline the fantasy world portrayed onscreen, and taken purely on its own terms, the score is an undeniable success". The [[film score]] review website [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]] wrote: "The score for ''The Black Cauldron'' was for Bernstein what ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' was for [[Jerry Goldsmith]] in the next decade: a fascinating journey into a fresh realm that required its music to play a more significant role in the film".

==Release==
For its initial release, the film became the first Disney animated film to receive a PG rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Jim|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2010/09/10/why-for-did-quot-the-black-cauldron-quot-fail-at-the-box-office.aspx|title=Why For did Disney's "The Black Cauldron" fail to connect with audiences back in 1985?|website=Jim Hill Media|date=September 10, 2010|accessdate=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also presented in [[Super Technirama 70]]—the first since ''Sleeping Beauty''—and [[Dolby Stereo#Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track|Dolby Stereo 70mm six-track surround sound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19850615&amp;id=1CI0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lfUIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1391,2043114&amp;hl=en|last=Diehl|first=Bill|title=Disney Pictures back to basics with fully-animated feature|newspaper=''[[Ottawa Citizen]]''|date=June 15, 1985|accessdate=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was re-released in 1990 in selected markets (including [[Portland, Oregon]]) under the title ''Taran and the Magic Cauldron''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ctc9AAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=taran+and+the+magic+cauldron&amp;article_id=4441,4206241&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiz4YvfgcfdAhWsxYMKHQTCDuk4FBDoATAGegQIARAb#v=onepage&amp;q=taran%20and%20the%20magic%20cauldron&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
On the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 57%, based on 30 reviews with an average score of 5.7/10. The critics' consensus stated "Ambitious but flawed, ''The Black Cauldron'' is technically brilliant as usual, but lacks the compelling characters of other Disney animated classics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_cauldron/|title=The Black Cauldron (1985)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd Alexander, the author of the books on which the film was based, had a more complex reaction to the film:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Lloyd|title=Lloyd Alexander Interview Transcript|url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/lloyd-alexander-interview-transcript|publisher=Scholastic|date=January 26, 1999&lt;!--interview date evidently 1999-01-26: "I will be 75 in another four days" --&gt;|accessdate=September 27, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121195938/http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/lloyd-alexander-interview-transcript|archivedate=January 21, 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;First, I have to say, there is no resemblance between the movie and the book. Having said that, the movie in itself, purely as a movie, I found to be very enjoyable. I had fun watching it. What I would hope is that anyone who sees the movie would certainly enjoy it, but I'd also hope that they'd actually read the book. The book is quite different. It's a very powerful, very moving story, and I think people would find a lot more depth in the book.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Home media==
Following many requests from fans, ''The Black Cauldron'' was released on [[VHS]] in the United Kingdom in 1997, and in the United States on August 4, 1998, as part of the [[Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection]],&lt;ref name=CTAugust4 /&gt; in a [[pan and scan|pan-and-scan]] transfer, thirteen years after its theatrical release.&lt;ref name=JHMWhatWentWrong/&gt; The film received a [[DVD]] release with a 2.20:1 non-anamorphic widescreen transfer in 2000, as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection line, featuring an art gallery, a new game "The Quest for the Black Cauldron", and the 1952 [[Donald Duck]] short ''[[Trick or Treat (1952 film)|Trick or Treat]]''.&lt;ref name="uD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/blackcauldron.html|title=The Black Cauldron 25th Anniversary DVD Review|publisher=DVDDizzy|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Disney announced a Special Edition DVD release of the film to be released in 2009, but failed. It was re-advertised as a 25th Anniversary Edition and released on September 14, 2010, in the US and UK. It contained a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, the new "Witch's Challenge" game, [[deleted scene]]s, and all of the features from the 2000 DVD release.

==Theme parks==
Costumed versions of the characters from the film have made occasional appearances at the Disney theme parks and resorts.

In 1986, the eatery "Lancer's Inn" at [[Walt Disney World]], was renamed "Gurgi's Munchies and Crunchies". Eventually, in 1993 they closed the place down then later remodeled it into "Lumiere's Kitchen", "The Village Fry Shoppe" and "The Friar's Nook" (its current name).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/wdworld/wdw1990.htm|title=Chronology of Walt Disney World (1990-1994)|website=www.islandnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fromscreentotheme.com/SundayBrunchVillageFryeShoppe.aspx|title=Sunday Brunch|website=www.fromscreentotheme.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video game of the same name was designed by [[Al Lowe]] of [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]] and released in 1986. It was made shortly after the first ''[[King's Quest]]'' game, so it resembled that adventure in many ways. Along with ''[[The Dark Crystal (video game)|The Dark Crystal]]'' it remains one of only a few adventure games by Sierra to be based on films.

The [[player character]] is a young assistant pig-keeper named Taran, who undertakes a quest to stop the evil Horned King, who seeks for Hen Wen, the magical pig of the wizard Dallben, for her [[Vision (religion)|visionary]] abilities. With these abilities, the Horned King would be able to discover the Black Cauldron and rule the land. Taran's first mission is to lead her to the [[Fairy|Fair Folk]] while the Horned King's dragons are looking for them. If the pig should be captured (the game allows either possibility), Taran can go to the Horned King's castle and rescue her. As soon as he is inside, Taran will meet Eilonwy with her magic bauble and may rescue Fflewddur Fflam, as well as discover a Magic Sword. The Cauldron is in the possession of three witches of Morva who will trade it for the Sword. Unfortunately a dragon grasps the cauldron and Taran goes back to encounter the evil man himself. The game actually featured plot branches and multiple endings depending on many variables, such as whether Hen Wen the pig was saved, how the cauldron was destroyed, and what reward was chosen afterwards. This use of multiple endings preceded the more famous use in [[Lucasfilm]]'s game ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'' by a year.

===Reception===
{{expand-section|date=October 2017}}
''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' in 1987 criticized the Atari ST version of ''The Black Cauldron'' as "typical of early software for newer computers. It doesn't fully utilize the ST's capabilities", citing the "chunky low-resolution" graphics "obviously ported from another make of computer". The magazine concluded that fans of other Sierra adventures would enjoy the game.&lt;ref name="loveless198704"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Loveless |first=Matthew |date=April 1987 |title=Black Cauldron |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v5n12/STProductNews.html |magazine=Antic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Persistence of Memory''''' ({{lang-ca|La persistència de la memòria}}) is a 1931 [[painting]] by artist [[Salvador Dalí]], and one of his most recognizable works. First shown at the [[Julien Levy Gallery]] in 1932, since 1934 the painting has been in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) in [[New York City]], which received it from an anonymous donor. It is widely recognized and frequently referenced in popular culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff editor|title=Dali, The Flamboyant Surrealist|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z2lcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tVYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=dal%C3%AD%20melting%20watch&amp;pg=4025%2C4123936|accessdate=20 June 2011|newspaper=The Vindicator|date=28 January 1989|quote=The death of Salvador Dali evokes the image of his most famous painting, ''Persistence of Memory''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes referred to by more descriptive (though incorrect) titles, such as "Melting Clocks", "The Soft Watches" or "The Melting Watches".{{by whom?|date=June 2017}}

==Description==
The well-known [[surrealist]] piece introduced the image of the soft melting [[pocket watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Kirsten|title=Essential Dalí|year=1999|publisher=;Dempsey Parr|isbn=978-1-84084-509-9|quote=It includes the first appearance of what is perhaps his most enduring image: the 'soft watch'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It epitomizes Dalí's theory of "softness" and "hardness", which was central to his thinking at the time. As [[Dawn Adès]] wrote, "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order".&lt;ref&gt;Ades, Dawn. Dalí. Thames and Hudson, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation suggests that Dalí was incorporating an understanding of the world introduced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of special relativity]]. Asked by [[Ilya Prigogine]] whether this was in fact the case, Dalí replied that the soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a [[Camembert]] melting in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Salvador Dali |date=2008 |title=The Dali Dimension: Decoding the Mind of a Genius |format=DVD |publisher=Media 3.14-TVC-FGSD-IRL-AVRO|url=http://www.dalidimension.com/eng/index.html|quote=Surprisingly, Dalí said that his soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a Camembert cheese melting in the sun. The painter insisted on this explanation in his reply letter to Prigogine, who took it as Dalí's reaction to Einstein's coldly mathematical theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to recognize a human figure in the middle of the composition, in the strange "monster" (with a lot of texture near its face, and lots of contrast and tone in the picture) that Dalí used in several contemporary pieces to represent himself – the abstract form becoming something of a self-portrait, reappearing frequently in his work. The figure can be read as a "fading" creature, one that often appears in dreams where the dreamer cannot pinpoint the creature's exact form and composition. One can observe that the creature has one closed eye with several eyelashes, suggesting that the creature is also in a dream state. The iconography may refer to a dream that Dalí himself had experienced, and the clocks may symbolize the passing of time as one experiences it in sleep or the persistence of time in the eyes of the dreamer.

The orange clock at the bottom left of the painting is covered in ants. Dalí often used ants in his paintings as a symbol of decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danilian symbolism I Salvador Dalí I Espace Dalí|url=http://daliparis.com/en/salvador-dali/dalinian-symbols|website=daliparis.com|accessdate=4 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925181611/http://daliparis.com/en/salvador-dali/dalinian-symbols|archive-date=25 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoMA I Salvador Dalí.

The fly appears to be casting a human shadow as the sun hits it. ''The Persistence of Memory'' employs "the exactitude of realist painting techniques"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7qeHVrQ5X-MC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=Persistence+of+Memory+Dali+dream+surrealism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7ejjTdHmO8zOgAeOqfGYBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=exactitude%20realist%20painting%20techniques&amp;f=false "Dali's dream environments were represented through the exactitude of realist painting techniques, like those found in his ''Persistence of Memory'' (1931)." ''Surrealism and Architecture'', by Thomas Mical; Psychology Press, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; to depict imagery more likely to be found in dreams than in waking consciousness.

The craggy rocks to the right represent a tip of [[Cap de Creus]] peninsula in north-eastern [[Catalonia]]. Many of Dalí's paintings were inspired by the landscapes of his life in Catalonia. The strange and foreboding shadow in the foreground of this painting is a reference to Mount Pani.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moodbook.com/history/modernism/salvador-dali-surreal.html Salvador Dali.

Dalí returned to the theme of this painting with the variation ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]]'' (1954), showing his earlier famous work systematically fragmenting into smaller component elements, and a series of rectangular blocks which reveal further imagery through the gaps between them, implying something beneath the surface of the original work; this work is now in the [[Salvador Dalí Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], while the original ''Persistence of Memory'' remains at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. Dalí also produced various [[lithograph]]s and [[sculpture]]s on the theme of soft watches late in his career. Some of these sculptures are the ''Persistence of Memory'', the ''Nobility of Time'', the ''Profile of Time'', and the ''Three Dancing Watches''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalisculptureeditions.com/Index.asp?Sez=Sculpture Dalis Sculpture Editions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708222040/http://www.dalisculptureeditions.com/Index.asp?Sez=Sculpture |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Thongdrel''' (alt. '''throngdrel''') is a large [[appliqué]] religious image normally only unveiled during  ''[[tsechu]]s'', the main religious festivals in [[Bhutan]].  They are the largest form of  ''[[thangka]]'' paintings in the tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].  Thongdrels typically depict a seated [[Guru Rinpoche]] surrounded by holy beings in a composition that, unlike most smaller thangkas, is in a "landscape" format, somewhat wider than it is tall.

Thongdrels are composed of several layers, mostly of silk.  These begin with a backing, then the image itself, made up of appliqué pieces sewn to a background.  Finally there is a yellow drape that covers and protects it when not on display.  Thongdrels are stored rolled up.  Thongdrels are displayed once a year as the highlight of the tsechu festival of a district or ''[[dzongkhag]]'' (although not every district has a thongdrel).  Typically they are displayed on the last day of the tsechu. The painting is not allowed to be struck by the direct rays of the sun, thus it may be unfurled at around 3:00 in the morning and rolled back up by 7:30 AM.  

Usually the architecture of the [[dzong]] provides a wall with access above, down which they may be unrolled, but sometimes metal hanging frames may be used. Major Tibetan centres have structures built into the defensive walls or other buildings specifically designed to give a large space for the display of festival thangkas. 

The mere viewing of the unfurled thongdrel is said to cleanse the viewer of sin.  They may also be exhibited at other important occasions such as royal coronations, when the thongdrel from a number of monasteries may be transported to appear.

[[Image:UnCoupdeDes-cover.jpg|thumb|240px|''Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard'', 1969]]
'''''Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard''''' (''A Throw of the Dice will Never Abolish Chance'') is an [[artist's book]] by [[Marcel Broodthaers]] published November 1969 in [[Antwerp]]. The work is a close copy of the first edition of the French [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolist]] poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Stéphane Mallarmé's]] [[Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard (Mallarmé)|poem of the same name]], published in 1914, but with all the words removed, replaced by black stripes that correspond directly to the typographic layout used by Mallarmé to articulate the text.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Broodthaers reduces ''Un Coup de Dés'' to its structure - or to put it another way he elevates the structure of the work to a concept worthy of study in its own right, thus acknowledging Mallarmé's own fetishistic attention to this aspect of his work. Rendering the structure concrete, visible, almost tactile, Broodthaers offers a conceptual analysis of Mallarmé's poem across the distance of a nearly a century...It would be hard to imagine a more subtle treatment of Mallarmé's work, or one more capable of demonstrating its essential properties, than this reworked book by Broodthaers. — Johanna Drucker&lt;ref&gt;The Century of Artists' Books, Drucker, Granary, 1995, p115-116&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Often included in exhibitions tracing the history of the artist's book,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforbookarts.org/exhibits/archive/bio.asp?artistID=523 Center for Book Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miami [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2479/is_2_31/ai_113650849 Miami Art Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; the work is seen as a seminal example of the European post-avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foundation.generali.at/index.php?id=336&amp;L=1 Generali Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; It is often referred to simply as ''Un Coup de Dés''.

== Concrete Poetry ==

=== Mallarmé and Magritte ===
Broodthaers had lived in poverty as a poet in Brussels for twenty years before becoming an artist in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online; Broodthaers essay by Michael Compton&lt;/ref&gt; His first exhibition, at the Galere Saint-Laurent, included two unsold parcels of his fourth book of poetry, ''Pense-Bête'', encased in plaster. This was the first of many works that 'employed techniques associated with poetry but applied by him not only to words but to images and symbols.'&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online; Broodthaers essay by Michael Compton&lt;/ref&gt; ''Un Coup de Dés'' would become the most famous instance of Broodthaers' interest in setting up a contradiction between the written word and a visual image 'to the profit of the subject.'&lt;ref&gt;Broodthaers quoted in Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980, p15&lt;/ref&gt;

Broodthaers had been given a copy of Mallarmé's ''Un Coup de Dés'' in 1945 by the Belgian surrealist painter [[Réné Magritte]] as 'a way of explaining his art to a young admirer without explaining it literally.'&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980, p15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As for the idea of establishing a direct relationship between literature and the plastic arts, I'm afraid I have done so by taking as a subject ''A Throw Of The Dice'', by Mallarmé !!! — Broodthaers&lt;ref&gt;"Quant à l'idée d'établir un rapport direct entre littérature et arts plastique j'ai peur l'avoir fait en prenant comme sujet Le Coup de Dès, de Mallarmé !!!" letter quoted in Marcel Broodthaers, Catalogue des Livres, 1957-75, Galerie Michael Werner, Köln 1982, p27&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mallarmé had written the poem in 1897 and left copious notes as to how it should be typeset, instructions that were finally carried out 16 years after his death, in 1914. The poem was famous for its extraordinary typography, which anticipated the 20th century interest in [[graphic design]] and [[concrete poetry]]. Mallarmé was known to have organised the layout of the poem using rectangles of card, and to leave written pleas to publish the work exactly as he'd intended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vispoets.com/index.php?showtopic=16889]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Broodthaers' work can be seen as a direct quote of Mallarmé's working methods and of his obsession with the visual layout of the text.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mallarmé is the source of all contemporary art... it unconsciously invents modern space. — Broodthaers, 1970&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barcelona2004.org/eng/actualidad/noticias/html/f042384.htm Quoted in Forum, Barcelona]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Literary Exhibition ===
[[Image:UnCoupDeDes-Broodthaers2.jpg|left|300px|thumb|''Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard'', an inner spread]]
Broodthaers' exhibition 'Exposition Littéraire autour de Mallarmé' at the Wide White Space Gallery, Antwerp, December 1969 consisted of a copy of Mallarmé's book 'opened so that, (as nearly always when a book is put in an exhibition) only two pages were visible. The meaning is there but cannot be entirely reached.'&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980, p12&lt;/ref&gt; A series of metal plates, made of [[Anodised#Anodized_aluminium|anodised aluminium]], engraved with black impressions standing in for the text, were hung on the wall whilst a recording of Broodthaers reciting the poem was played continuously for the duration of the exhibition. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The word was "there", more "real", because three dimensional, than the original pages but, of course, negative and illegible. Meanwhile, the tape-recorded voice of the artist read out the poem repeatedly, it was "there" but not simultaneously and continuously present like the words of the poem.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980, p12&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The book ===
After a brief introduction citing the original edition published in 1914 by Librairie Gallimard, the book starts with the entire poem written as a block of text which is rectangular if the type of Mallarme's poem is 'regular' and oblique if the type from Mallarme is italic. 12 double spreads follow, with immaculately laid out black shapes standing in for the text. The work is soft bound and feels quite insubstantial. The cover is a near-perfect facsimile of the original cover, but with the word 'image' replacing 'poem' in the centre of the design.

The edition was published in Antwerp to coincide with the exhibition on 25 November 1969. 10 copies of the work - unbound, numbered I-X, printed onto 12 aluminium sheets - were made available, along with 90 copies printed on translucent paper and 300 copies on normal paper. The translucent edition came with two sheets of white card cut to the size of the book so that individual pages could be isolated by the reader if they so wished.

=== Reception of the book ===
The book, like Broodthaers' work in general, has gradually grown in stature since his death in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online; Broodthaers&lt;/ref&gt; and has found its way into a number of important collections, including [[MOMA]], [[V&amp;A]], and the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp]].
It also has inspired other reworks, like this one by Michalis Pichler: "In Michalis Pichlers’ 2008 rework the blocks are cut out, creating a negative space and geometric pattern of cuts and absence. (...) The idea of remake and of version, using another existing work as point of departure, relieves the artist of the onus of originality while allowing the new gesture to stand as a novel gesture. Un-originality, anti-expressiveness – these are terms that are of more recent vintage than first generation conceptualism." &lt;ref&gt;Johanna Drucker, "Artists’ Books and Conceptualism(s)" in "MULTIPLE, LIMITED, UNIQUE", The Center for Book Arts, New York 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Woody Guthrie Foundation''', founded in 1972, is a non-profit organization which formerly served as administrator and caretaker of the [[Woody Guthrie]] Archives. Dedicated to the preservation and dissemination of information about Guthrie's vast cultural legacy, the Woody Guthrie Archives houses the largest collection of Woody Guthrie material in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/535470 3rd Annual Woody Guthrie Fellowship Program Opens]. [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI News]], September 21, 2007. Retrieved November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The archives opened to the public in New York City in 1996.

The Woody Guthrie Center features, in addition to the archives, a museum focused on the life and the influence of Guthrie through his music, writings, art, and political activities. The museum is open to the public; the archives is open only to researchers by appointment. The archives contains thousands of items related to Guthrie, including original artwork, books, correspondence, lyrics, manuscripts, media, notebooks, periodicals, personal papers, photographs, scrapbooks, and other special collections.&lt;ref&gt;http://woodyguthriecenter.org/archives/&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2007, Woody Guthrie Publications, in cooperation with the Woody Guthrie Foundation released ''The Live Wire: Woody Guthrie in Performance 1949'', accompanied by a 72-page book describing the performance and the project. Paul Braverman, a student at [[Rutgers University]] in 1949, made the recordings himself using a small wire recorder at a Guthrie concert in Newark, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;Himes, Geoffrey.

The Foundation was previously based in Brooklyn, New York and directed by Woody Guthrie's daughter Nora Guthrie. Nora Guthrie opened up the Foundation's archives to musicians of many types, who she encouraged to write and record music for the many hundreds of Woody Guthrie's written lyrics. Following Woody Guthrie's death, many of these lyrics were without surviving melodies, as Woody did not write musical notation and never recorded (or taught anyone) the majority of his original compositions.

In 1995, Nora Guthrie had invited alternative folk-rocker [[Billy Bragg]] to select some lyrics from the archive to be set to music and then to be recorded commercially.  Bragg then invited the [[Alternative country|alt-country]] band [[Wilco]] to help complete the project.  Wilco and Bragg released 2 acclaimed "Mermaid Avenue" albums in 1998 and 2000, using Woody's lyrics set to their own musical compositions. Also, a film documentary [[Man in the Sand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdtalk.com/noraguthrieinterview.html Man in The Sand: A Talk with Nora Guthrie]. [[DVDTalk|DVDtalk.com]], Retrieved November 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; was released documenting not only the making of the Mermaid Avenue albums but also Bragg's exploration of Woody Guthrie's origins in hometown [[Okemah, Oklahoma]]. Many other collaborative projects by others have followed.

* 2018 - Jimmy LaFave - ''Peace Town'' (album) - this posthumous release contains 3 songs with Guthrie lyrics set to LaFave music, including the title track.

One of the lyrics which was worked several times by Billy Bragg, "All You Fascists", has subsequently surfaced in a recording of a 1944 radio program "The Martins and the McCoys".  Guthrie appeared in the program with other folk singers and can be heard singing "All of You Fascists Bound to Lose&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwcKwGS7OSQ - Retrieved September 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;, set to his original melody, which is of course substantially different from the melodies Bragg has devised for it.

Given the quantity of these posthumous collaborations, it was perhaps inevitable that there would be some lyrics set to more than one melody. For instance, track 3 on the Wasserman album ("Ease My Revolutionary Mind") uses the same set of lyrics as track 3 on the Farrar album (as well as track 3 on the Autumn Defense album). Track 2 on the Brooke album ("You'd Oughta Be Satisfied Now") uses the same set of lyrics as track 5 on the third volume of "Mermaid Avenue". The Woody Guthrie Publications website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.woodyguthrie.org/Lyrics/Lyrics.htm&lt;/ref&gt; lists Jonatha Brooke's version of "You'd Oughta Be Satisfied Now" as a "[[derivative work]]".
