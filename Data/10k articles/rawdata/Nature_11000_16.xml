[[File:A pasture in Asagiri-kogen.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mount Fuji]] (3,776&amp;nbsp;m) from Asagiri-kōgen]]
{{Nihongo|'''''100 Famous Japanese Mountains'''''|日本百名山|Nihon Hyaku-meizan}} is a book composed in 1964 by [[Mountaineering|mountaineer]] and author [[Kyūya Fukada]].&lt;ref name="hyakumeizan"&gt;[http://www.japangazetteer.com/ Hyakumeizan, Hiking Japan!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109090538/http://www.japangazetteer.com/ |date=2007-01-09 }}. Japan Gazetteer. Accessed June 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The list became famous when [[Crown Prince]] [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Naruhito]] took note of it{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. The list has been the topic of [[NHK]] documentaries, and other hiking books.

The complete list (sorted into [[Regions of Japan|regions]] from northeast to southwest) is below.

==History==
The selection of celebrated mountains had been done since the [[Edo period]]. [[Tani Bunchō]] praised 90 mountains as celebrated mountains in 日本名山図会 (''A collection of maps and pictures of famous Japanese mountains''), but among these were included such small mountains as Mount Asama in [[Ise, Mie]] and [[Mount Nokogiri (Chiba)|Mount Nokogiri]] on the [[Boso Peninsula]]. Unsatisfied with this selection, Fukuda, who had climbed many mountains in Japan, selected 100 celebrated Japanese mountains based on a combination of grace, history, and individuality, moreover excluding mountains with an altitude of less than {{Convert|1500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

Though it was at first unknown other than to some hiking-lovers and avid readers, reports that the list was one of the Prince's favorite books increased its profile. The Crown Prince is a mountain enthusiast to the extent that he has even belonged to an [[alpine club]], and it has been reported that it is a dream of his to reach the summit of every mountain on the list.

Since the 1980s, there has been a climbing boom amongst the middle-aged.  It is not [[rock climbing]] that has been popularised, but rather hiking or trekking.{{Clarify|date=June 2009}} However, due to the creation of more mountain lodges and trails, and the improvement of mountaineering technology, it became possible to climb mountains which had previously been considered very rugged.

The list became widely read, and people who choose mountains from the book to climb have increased. In imitation of Prince Naruhito, many people have also set the goal of reaching every summit on the list.

Mountaineering programs on [[NHK]] helped popularize the list. The station televised a documentary about taking up the mountains on the list one by one, and [[Rambō Minami]]'s mountaineering primer for the middle-aged. These gained wide popularity, and the list became widely known. Since then, lists of 200 and 300 mountains, lists of hundreds of mountains in various localities, and a list of 100 floral mountains have appeared.

In 2002, a new record traversing all of the mountains in 66 days was established.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} This was superseded in 2007, with a new record of 48 continuous days.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

English translation by Martin Hood is published as ''One Hundred Mountains of Japan'' ([[University of Hawaii Press]] 2014）.

==Assessment==
Compared to other modern essays on Japanese mountains such as ''Mountaineering and Exploration in the Japanese Alps'' by [[Walter Weston]], the book is short. Fukuda writes about the history of the mountains, especially the origins of their names. It is not a text that people can read to vicariously experience climbing or nature. Some think that the reason the list has been widely well received is that it put into focus 100 mountains which were already well known.

==Selection criteria==

Fukada selected 100 mountains from those which are 1,500 meter or higher and he had climbed up ever, according to three criteria: grace, history and individuality. He softened the altitude limit on some exceptions, like [[Mount Tsukuba]] and [[Mount Kaimon]]. 

There have been many varying opinions about the criteria for selection. It is often pointed out that the list emphasises mountains in the [[Chūbu region]]. It has been reported that Fukada, who was from [[Ishikawa Prefecture]], was brought up looking at Mt. Haku, but he only selected 13 further west. 

However, grace and individuality are in the eye of the beholder, and throughout history, many legends have been circulated about mountains throughout the [[Kansai region|Kinki region]]. Moreover, many mountain-lovers{{who|date=September 2014}} have argued that since [[Mount Tsukuba]], with an altitude of 877 meters (876 at the time), was selected, certain mountains in other localities should have been selected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16416">In 1996, [[Alberta]] began to restructure its [[electricity market]] away from traditional [[regulation]] to a [[Free market|market-based]] system. The market now includes a host of buyers and sellers, and an increasingly diverse infrastructure.

Consumers range from residential buyers to huge industrial consumers mining the [[oil sands]], operating [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and milling forest products. On the supply side, generators range from [[wind farm]]s east of [[Crowsnest Pass]] to huge coal-fired plants near [[Edmonton]]. The diversity of Alberta's electricity supply has increased substantially. To a large extent because of deregulation, the province has more technology, fuels, locations, ownership, and maintenance diversity than in the past.  The system's reliability, its cost structure and Alberta's collective exposure to [[risk]] are now met by a complex system based on diverse [[electric power|power]] sources, mainly coal and natural gas, with some wind and hydroelectric energy sources.

== History ==
{{further|TransAlta|ENMAX|EPCOR|List of power stations in Alberta}}
[[File:Sheerness GS - Hanna, AB.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sheerness Generating Station]], near Hanna. Commissioned in 1986, the 760-MW coal-fired power plant is a joint venture between [[ATCO]] and [[TransAlta]].]]

The Alberta Government passed the Electric Utilities Act(1996) effective January 1, 1996, which created Power Pool of Alberta, a wholesale market clearing entity. The Power Pool was a not for profit entity that operated the "competitive wholesale market including dispatch of generation."{{Sfn|Manning|nd|}} The Electric Utilities Act stipulated all electric energy bought and sold in Alberta had to be exchanged through the Power Pool which "served as an independent, central, open access pool." It functioned as a "spot market intending to match the demand with the lowest cost supply and establish an hourly pool price."{{Sfn|Manning|nd|}} 
Alberta was the first Canadian province to implement a deregulated electricity market. Competitive wholesale markets were being fostered in the 1990s as part of the [[liberalization]] process of the 1990s changing some parameters such as the unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution functions of incumbent utilities.{{Sfn|International Energy Agency|2009|pages=193–195}} Local distribution utilities, either investor- or municipally owned, retained the obligation to supply and the 6 largest utilities were assigned a share of the output of existing generators at a fixed price. The province moved to full retail access in 2001. In 2003 The [[Alberta Electric System Operator]] was established under the provisions of the Electric Utilities Act,{{Sfn|Manning|nd|}} and through the AESO, a spot market was created. After consumers complained about high prices in 2000, the government implemented a Regulated Rate Option (RRO), as a means to shield consumers from price volatility.&lt;ref name="Deewes"&gt;{{citation|first=Donald N. |last=Deewes |title=Electricity Restructuring and Regulation in the Provinces: Ontario and Beyond |work=Energy, Sustainability and Integration. The CCGES Transatlantic Energy Conference |date=9–10 September 2005 |location=Toronto |url=http://repec.economics.utoronto.ca/files/tecipa-205-1.pdf |accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generation sector in Alberta is dominated by [[TransAlta]] (formerly Calgary Power), [[ENMAX]], and [[Capital Power Corporation]], a [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[Edmonton]]'s municipally owned company [[EPCOR]]. Utility companies in Alberta also include the wind generating [[Bullfrog Power]], [[TransAlta Corporation]], Alberta Power limited, [[AltaLink]], [[ATCO Power]] and FortisAlberta. Although 5,700 megawatts of new generation was added and 1,470 of old plants were retired between 1998 and 2009,&lt;ref name="AlbertaStats"&gt;{{citation|author=Government of Alberta |title=Electricity Statistics |publisher=Energy Alberta|url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/Electricity/682.asp |accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; coal still accounted for 73.8% of utility-generated power in 2007, followed by natural gas, with 20.6%.&lt;ref name="57_002_2007p20"&gt;{{harvnb|Statistics Canada|2009|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Installed capacity reached 12,834 megawatts in 2009, with coal (5,692 MW) and natural gas (5,189 MW) representing the bulk of the province's generation fleet. As of 2008, Alberta's electricity sector was the most [[emission intensity|carbon-intensive]] of all Canadian provinces and territories, with total emissions of 55.9 million tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{chem|CO|2}} equivalent]] in 2008, accounting for 47% of all Canadian emissions in the electricity and heat generation sector.&lt;ref name="GHG2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Environment Canada|publisher=[[UNFCCC]]|title=National Inventory Report Greenhouse Gas Sources and Sinks in Canada 1990–2008 (3 volumes)|url=http://unfccc.int/national_reports/annex_i_ghg_inventories/national_inventories_submissions/items/8812.php |date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, electrical generation consisted of coal (55%), natural gas (35%), renewable  and  alternative  sources  (11%).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/EnergyPoliciesofIEACountriesCanada2015Review.pdf pg186&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 2010 wind capacity had reached 657 MW and hydroelectric capacity produced 900 MW.&lt;ref name="AlbertaStats"/&gt; In June 2010 the federal government announced tougher new emission measures. Alberta will likely remain dependent on coal generated electricity into 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Dina |last=O'Meara |title=Industry needs time to move from coal-fired power |work=Calgary Herald|location=Calgary |date=23 June 2010 |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/technology/Industry+needs+time+move+from+coal+fired+power/3193217/story.html|accessdate=2010-09-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market components==
Alberta's electricity market consists of five fundamental components and features.
*Seventeen firms supply [[electricity]] into the [[grid connection|grid]]. Five of those providers—[[ATCO]] Power, [[Enmax]], [[Capital Power Corporation]], [[TransAlta]] and [[TransCanada Corp.]]—supply about 80% of the province's generation capacity.
*Alberta's transmission grid, owned in sections by companies like [[TransAlta]], [[AltaLink]] and [[ATCO]] Electric, then carries [[electricity]] produced by generating providers to wholesale electricity purchasers or retailers. 
*The [[Alberta Electric System Operator|Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeso.ca/ Alberta Electric System Operator]&lt;/ref&gt; leads the planning and operation of the [[Electric power transmission|power system]], facilitates competitive power markets. Also, it ensures and manages open access to the grid.
*There are about 160 wholesale electricity purchasers, many of which are also resellers to other end-users like [[ENMAX]], [[EPCOR]], [[Fortis Inc.|Fortis]]Alberta, and [[Direct Energy]].
*Retail consumers have the option to buy electricity at competitive prices from third-party sellers like [[Just Energy]] or at regulated prices through the local utility like [[ENMAX]] and [[EPCOR]].
*The Market Surveillance Administrator&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertamsa.ca/ Market Surveillance Administrator]&lt;/ref&gt; ensures that Alberta's electricity markets are fair, efficient and competitive.

=== AESO ===
While generation companies (e.g., EPCOR) continue to own both generation and transmission in Alberta, the [[Alberta Electric System Operator]] (AESO) which is "independent of any industry affiliations and owns no transmission or market assets" has transmission control.{{Sfn|Brennan|2008|page=19}}  The Alberta Minister of Energy appoints the members of AESO's board.{{Sfn|Brennan|2008|page=19}}  "[It] is governed by an independent board, which has a diverse background in finance, business, electricity, oil and gas, energy management, regulatory affairs and technology. The Board's governance strategy is founded on balancing the interests of a diverse set of stakeholders, while at the same time, providing benefit for the overall industry stakeholder needs. (AESO cited in Brennan 2008:9)."{{Sfn|Brennan|2008|page=19}}

==Supply interdependence with British Columbia==
{{Cities in Alberta}}Alberta and neighbouring [[British Columbia]] are buyers and sellers of each other's power. Historically, Albertans buy from B.C. during peak hours. Similarly, B.C. buys from Alberta frequently during off-peak periods (weekends, evenings, or statutory holidays when demand in Alberta diminishes). This arrangement confers benefits on both provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertamsa.ca/files/The_Battery_and_the_Charger.pdf The battery and the charger]&lt;/ref&gt;

The power-exchanging relationship between the two provinces is based on [[geography]]. Alberta has [[coal]] and [[natural gas]], while B.C. has big mountains, long valleys and historically an abundance of water resources. As a result, B.C. based its system on [[hydroelectric power]] while Alberta constructed one that primarily burns [[hydrocarbon]]s, mostly gas and coal. Over the years the two provinces have evolved an interdependent relationship.

Alberta's electrical demand varies throughout the day and across the seasons. When individuals are fixing supper and using home appliances, demand for power goes up, as it does during heat waves and cold snaps. It tapers off during spring and fall. Like other mechanical devices, generators fail from time to time. If they are wind-powered, their output varies with the wind.

Whether for reasons of temporary high demand, short supply or both, Alberta buys electricity from its western neighbour through [[AESO]]. By contrast, Alberta might sell electricity to British Columbia during off-peak periods. During that period, B.C. uses that power to reduce its hydroelectric generation.

Alberta buys electricity from B.C. during periods of peak consumption, on unusually cold or hot days or when a larger-than-normal number of generators are down for maintenance. British Columbia buys electricity from Alberta during off-peak periods. This arrangement enables both provinces to make use of their generating and storage capacity and use assets more efficiently. Also, it keeps power prices lower in both provinces than they would otherwise be.

This arrangement evolved because of physical differences between the two electrical systems. It depends little on differences in the two market models.

==Market models==
The differences between Alberta's and British Columbia's market models represent the two extremes in use within Canada. Alberta has developed a system in which markets determine prices and the pace of investment. B.C. has a conventional cost of service regulated power system (that exists in most of Canada and most of the United States).  

Despite the vast differences in market design and because of large differences in the mix of generation assets, the electricity systems of Alberta and British Columbia enjoy a unique symbiotic relationship.  B.C. provides a market for Alberta's off-peak surplus and a peaking supply for Alberta's crunch periods.  The investment climate in Alberta has attracted a steady stream of private investors-funded generation projects since 1996. This is one of the reasons Alberta's electricity system has provided reliable, sustainable power even during periods of rapid economic growth.

== Cost of electricity in Alberta ==

In April 2013, Calgary ranked third (with an average monthly payment of $216{{Sfn|Hydro Quebec|2013|page=9}} based on a monthly consumption of 1,000 kWh) and Edmonton fourth ($202 a month) in Canada compared to other cities in terms of high electricity bills. Halifax placed first and worst in Canada at $225{{Sfn|Hydro Quebec|2013|page=9}} a month. Compared to other cities in North America, Calgary and Edmonton placed seventh and eighth in terms of highest power costs.{{Sfn|Hydro Quebec|2013}} Vancouver, BC was among the least expensive ($130 a month).{{Sfn|Hydro Quebec|2013|page=9}}

The unit price of electricity in Calgary in April 2013 was 14.81 cents per kWh, compared to 6.87 cents per kWh in Montreal, 15.45 in Halifax.{{Sfn|Hydro Quebec|2013|page=4}}

Keith Provost, former senior vice-president of Alberta Power Ltd. (now ATCO Power), with decades of experience in the electrical utilities business, argued that instead of marketing electricity contracts for future deliveries in a regulated market, AESO has their own system that is open to manipulation and is not a free-market system. According to AESO, "The pool price is the arithmetic average of the 60 one-minute system marginal prices. Only those offers accepted generate power and receive the AESO pool price. All offers accepted receive the same price, the pool price, not the price offered."{{Sfn|Provost|2013}} It is this deregulated system that causes volatility in the price of electricity, keeps consumer prices high while maximizing profits to generating companies.{{Sfn|Provost|2013}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Amaltheia''' ({{lang-el|Ἀμάλθεια}}) is the most-frequently mentioned foster-mother of [[Zeus]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Amaltheia'', in Greek "tender goddess", is clearly an [[epithet]], signifying the presence of an earlier nurturing goddess,&lt;ref&gt;"...the business of Amaltheia, caves and the nurturing of Zeus lands us squarely in Minoan times," [[John Bennet (archaeologist)|John Bennet]] remarked in passing (Bennet, "The Structure of the Linear B Administration at Knossos" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''89'''.2 [April 1985:231-249] p. 107 note 39); cf. [[Martin Nilsson|M.P. Nilsson]], ''The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and its Survival in Greek Religion'' (1950:537ff).&lt;/ref&gt; whom the [[Hellenes]], whose myths we know, knew to be located in [[Crete]], where [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]s may have called her a version of "[[Dikte]]".&lt;ref&gt;An Egyptian inscription of [[Amenhotep III]] (1406-1369 BCE) discussed by Michael C. Astour, "Aegean Place-Names in an Egyptian Inscription" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''70'''.4 (October 1966:313-317), "shows that the Egyptian scribe conceived the Minoan form of ''Diktê'' as the [[Northwest Semitic]] word ''dqt''... ''Aigaion oros=Diktê'' may well be a Graeco-Semitic doublet, for in [[Ugarit]]ic ritual texts ''dqt'' (literally 'small one') was the term for 'female head of small cattle for sacrifice' and a goat rather than a sheep. ''Dqt'' is also found as a divine name in a Ugaritic list of gods, which reminds us of the goat that nourished Zeus in the [[Dictaean cave]]." (p. 314).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
There were different traditions regarding Amaltheia.&lt;ref&gt;See Smith, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DA%3Aentry+group%3D18%3Aentry%3Damaltheia-bio-1 "Amaltheia"].&lt;/ref&gt;
Amaltheia is sometimes represented as the [[goat]] who nurtured the infant-god in a cave in Cretan Mount Aigaion ("Goat Mountain"),&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:453-491 484].&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes as a goat-tending [[nymph]]&lt;ref&gt;For the primitive Amalthea as the goat rather than the goat-herding nymph, see R.W. Hutchinson, ''Prehistoric Crete'' (1962:202).&lt;/ref&gt; of uncertain parentage (the daughter of [[Oceanus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]''  182 (Smith and Trzaskoma, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vczTNMWLGdoC&amp;pg=PA158 p. 158]. An outdated Latin text of Hyginus' ''Fabulae'' has ''Althaea'', see Smith and Trzaskoma, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vczTNMWLGdoC&amp;pg=PA191 p. 191 endnote to 182]; West, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sp5fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Althaea+Hyg.+Fab.+182&amp;dq=Althaea+Hyg.+Fab.+182&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidxreOrPjOAhXMsh4KHboABJQQ6AEIHDAA p. 133]); Smith, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DA%3Aentry+group%3D18%3Aentry%3Damaltheia-bio-1 "Amaltheia"], which cites [https://archive.org/stream/scholiagraecain05dindgoog#page/n195/mode/1up Schol. ''ad Hom. II.'' 21.194].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helios]],&lt;ref&gt;Gee, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NPsh5CsJprYC&amp;pg=PA131 131]&amp;ndash;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NPsh5CsJprYC&amp;pg=PA132 132], which cites the epitome of [[Eratosthenes]] ''[[Catasterismi|Catasterismoi]]'' 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Haemonius,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.7.5 2.7.5].&lt;/ref&gt; or—according to Lactantius—[[Melisseus]]&lt;ref&gt;The early fourth-century Christian apologist [[Lactantius]] (''Institutiones'' I.22) makes the father of Amalthea and her honey-providing sister [[Melissa]], a Melisseus, "king of Crete"; this example of the common Christian [[Euhemerist]] interpretation of Greek myth as fables of humans superstitiously credited with supernatural powers during the passage of time does not represent the actual cultural history of Amalthea, save in its synthesised reflection of an alternative mythic tradition, that infant Zeus was fed with honey: see [[Bee (mythology)]].&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Aratus of Sicyon]], the [[Achaean League|Achaeans]] believed that his happened in their capital [[Aegium]] (Strabo, ''Geography'', VIII 7,5). Legendary infancy episodes of some historical figures—and poetical figures, such as Longus' [[Daphnis and Chloe|Daphnis]]—were suckled by goats, and the actual practice lingered in Italy into the nineteenth century: see William M. Calder, III, "Longus 1. 2: The She-Goat Nurse" ''Classical Philology'' '''78'''.1 (January 1983:50–51).&lt;/ref&gt; The possession of multiple and uncertain mythological parents indicates wide worship of a deity in many cultures having varying local traditions. Other names, like [[Adrasteia]], Ide, the nymph of [[Mount Ida (Crete)|Mount Ida]], or [[Adamanthea]], which appear in mythology handbooks,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Evslin, ''Gods, Demigods and Demons: A Handbook of Greek Mythology'': ''s.v.'' "Adamanthea", "Amalthea"; Patricia Monaghan, ''Encyclopedia of Goddesses and Heroines'', 2009, ''s.v.'' Adamanthea".&lt;/ref&gt; are simply duplicates of Amaltheia.

In the tradition represented by [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'',  Cronus swallowed all of his children immediately after birth. The mother goddess [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], Zeus' mother, deceived her brother consort Cronus by giving him a stone wrapped to look like a baby instead of Zeus. Since she instead gave the infant Zeus to Adamanthea to nurse in a cave on a mountain in Crete, it is clear that Adamanthea is a doublet of Amaltheia. In many literary references, the Greek tradition relates that in order that [[Cronus]] should not hear the wailing of the infant, Amaltheia gathered about the cave the [[Kuretes]] or the [[Korybantes]] to dance, shout, and clash their spears against their shields.&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Still a baby, Zeus would have broken off one of Amalthea's horns while playing, which would become the [[Cornucopia|cornucopia]]&lt;ref&gt;David Leeming, ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 13; Robert Parker, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=F_ATDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=cornucopia&amp;f=false Polytheism and Society at Athens]'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;, and turning Amalthea into the first [[Unicorn|unicorn]], a reference used by [[Peter S. Beagle]] in his novel ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'', as Schmendrick, the magician, called the main character "Lady Amalthea", without giving any explanation to his choice.

==The aegis==
Amaltheia's skin, or that of her goat, taken by Zeus in honor of her when she died, became the protective [[aegis]] in some traditions.

==Among the stars==
"Amaltheia was placed amongst the stars as the constellation Capra—the group of stars surrounding [[Capella (star)|Capella]] on the arm (''ôlenê'') of [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga the Charioteer]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Ther/AixAmaltheia.html Theoi Project: "Amaltheia"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Capra'' simply means "she-goat" and the star-name ''Capella'' is the "little goat", but some modern readers confuse her with the male sea-goat of the [[Zodiac]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], who bears no relation to Amaltheia, no connection in a Greek or Latin literary source nor any ritual or inscription to join the two. [[Hyginus]] describes this [[catasterism]] in the ''Poetic Astronomy'', in speaking of Auriga, the Charioteer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;[[Parmeniscus]] says that a certain [[Melisseus]] was king in Crete, and to his daughters Jove was brought to nurse. Since they did not have milk, they furnished him a she-goat, Amaltheia by name, who is said to have reared him. She often bore twin kids, and at the very time that Jove was brought to her to nurse, had borne a pair. And so because of the kindness of the mother, the kids, too were placed among the constellations. [[Cleostratus|Cleostratus of Tenedos]] is said to have first pointed out these kids among the stars.

But [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]] says Jove was nursed by [[Themis]] and the nymph Amaltheia, to whom he was given by [[Ops]], his mother. Now Amaltheia had as a pet a certain goat which is said to have nursed Jove.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica.html  Theoi Project: on-line complete text in English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Batokunku''' (also spelled ''Batukunku'') is a village located in [[Kombo South]], one of the nine districts of [[The Gambia]]'s [[Western Division (The Gambia)|Western Division]]. In January 2009, the village became notable as the location of the first [[wind turbine]] erected in West Africa.  The 150 kilowatt turbine, a second-hand machine originally built by the [[Denmark|Danish]] wind energy manufacturer Bonus, currently provides electrical power for the entire village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Dierk Jensen | title =A Second Life in Africa | publisher =New Energy Magazine  | date =March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The windmill is currently serviced/maintained by Global Energy (generator service) based in the nearby village of Tujereng in collaboration with Windstrom SH from Germany.

'''Carbon Process Management (CPM)''' is a management process which promotes environmental effectiveness in organizations. It is designed to maximize efficiencies in the consumption of resources that contribute to climate change. When implemented effectively, CPM techniques can reduce operating costs, realizing gains in [[brand equity]], competitive advantage and stakeholder value. Initially introduced by [[First Carbon Solutions]], CPM uses [[Kaizen|Japanese kaizen]] philosophy which continuously improves workplace practices to reduce wastage, this is combined [[Business process management|business process management (BPM)]] which increases efficiency. Governments who resorts to legal mechanisms and regulation to deal with the risks of climate change, techniques such as CPM are directed towards a corporate approach in helping reduce [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Carbon management and sustainability  | url=http://www.firstcarbonsolutions.com/ | work= First Carbon Solutions | accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Outsourcing 2010: Green growth, public sector deals and rise of the SME |url=http://www.silicon.com/technology/it-services/2010/01/12/outsourcing-2010-green-growth-public-sector-deals-and-rise-of-the-sme-39745317/ |work=Silicon, a CBS Interactive Limited |accessdate=2010-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323065152/http://www.silicon.com/technology/it-services/2010/01/12/outsourcing-2010-green-growth-public-sector-deals-and-rise-of-the-sme-39745317/ |archivedate=2010-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Going green |url=http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=5871 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221516/http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=5871 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-09-23 |work=Business World Online |accessdate=2010-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= What is your carbon footprint?  | url= http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=551149&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=85 | work=Philippine Star | accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2117">'''Centre for Renewable Energy''' (short: SFFE, from Norwegian ''Senter for fornybar energi'') is a virtual research centre owned by [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (NTNU), [[SINTEF]], [[Institute for Energy Technology]] (IFE) and [[University of Oslo]] (UiO). SFFE was established in 2004, initially as a unifying organ for SINTEF and NTNU. IFE and UiO became co-owners of the Centre in 2005 and 2011, respectively. The goal of SFFE is to increase the quality, efficiency and scope of education, research, development and innovation within [[renewable energy]] in [[Norway]]. SFFE works to coordinate the available competence and the research and education activities localized at its member institutions.&lt;ref name="sffe.no"&gt;[http://www.sffe.no/?lang=en SFFE homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the internal network in the member institutions included more than 400 scientists (including [[Doctoral studies|doctoral students]]) working on renewable energy. The current leader of the Centre is Gabriella Tranell ([[associate professor]] at Department of Materials Science and Engineering, NTNU).&lt;ref name="sffe2010"&gt;Annual report 2010, Centre for Renewable Energy&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the owners of SFFE represent Norway's largest resource in renewable energy research. Research fields at the Centre include small scale [[hydropower]], [[wind energy]], [[solar energy]], [[wave energy]], and [[bio-energy]] as well as the social dimensions of energy use. Competence has recently been developed in [[ocean energy]] fields, especially research on [[offshore wind power]] and [[tidal power]].&lt;ref name="sffe.no" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Technology as a driving force in climate policy'' ( Bjørn-Erik Haugan, Cicerone, Number: 6.  pp.8-9. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">[[File:Sunspot Numbers.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The Dalton minimum in the 400-year history of sunspot numbers]]
The '''Dalton Minimum''' was a period of low [[sunspot]] count, representing low [[solar activity]], named after the English meteorologist [[John Dalton]], lasting from about 1790 to 1830&lt;ref&gt;Komitov and Kaftan 2004&lt;/ref&gt; or 1796 to 1820,&lt;ref&gt;Archibald, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to the period [[solar cycle 4]] to [[solar cycle 7]].

==Temperature==
Like the [[Maunder Minimum]] and [[Spörer Minimum]], the Dalton Minimum coincided with a period of lower-than-average global temperatures. During that period, there was a variation of temperature of about 1&amp;nbsp;°C in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Temperaturreihe Deutschland, Jahr, 30-10.PNG|File:Temperaturreihe Deutschland.png, red line, 1795 to 1815]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of the lower-than-average temperatures and their possible relation to the low sunspot count are not well understood. Recent papers have suggested that a rise in [[volcanism]] was largely responsible for the cooling trend.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner and Zorita, as well as Wilson.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Year Without a Summer]], in 1816, occurred during the Dalton Minimum, the prime reason for that year's cool temperatures was the [[Volcanic Explosivity Index#Classification|highly explosive]] 1815 eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in Indonesia, which was one of the two largest eruptions in the past 2000 years. One must also consider that the rise in [[volcanism]] may have been triggered by lower levels of solar output as there is a weak but statistically significant link between decreased solar output and an increase in volcanism.&lt;ref&gt;https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/st07500u.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Henry Lewis''', [[New Zealand Order of Merit|DCNZM]] (1917 – 23 October 2002) was a [[sailor]], [[adventurer]], doctor, and [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] scholar. He is best known for his studies on the traditional systems of navigation used by the Pacific Islanders.  His studies, published in the book ''[[We, the Navigators]]'', made these navigational methods known to a wide audience and helped to inspire a revival of traditional voyaging methods in the South Pacific.

==Early life==
David was born in Plymouth, [[England]] and raised in [[New Zealand]] and [[Rarotonga]].  He was sent to the Polynesian school in Rarotonga, where he apparently developed his appreciation for Polynesian identity and culture.  He remained a New Zealander throughout his life, though he eventually retired to Queensland.

After an adventurous childhood and teenage years including mountaineering and skiing in New Zealand, and a multi-hundred mile kayak journey, he traveled to England in 1938 for medical training at the [[University of Leeds]], and served in the British army as a medical officer. After the war, he worked as a doctor in London, and was involved in setting up the [[National Health Service]].

==Sailing==
With the announcement in 1960 of the first [[Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race|single-handed trans-Atlantic yacht race]] (from Plymouth, UK to the US East Coast), Lewis decided to enter in a small 25-foot boat.  Following a series of accidents, including a [[dismasting]] shortly after leaving, he finished third (Francis Chichester came first), as described in his book ''The Ship Would Not Travel Due West''. 

He later decided to sail around the world with his second wife and two small daughters, and built the ocean cruising [[catamaran]] ''Rehu Moana'', for this purpose.  After an initial voyage towards Greenland, he entered the 1964 single-handed trans-Atlantic race and picked up his family in the United States. They circumnavigated by way of the [[Strait of Magellan]], the South Pacific and the [[Cape of Good Hope]].  (See his book ''Daughters of the Wind''.)  This was the world’s first circumnavigation by [[multihull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Sailor Who Set Out To See It All, David Lewis Obituary|first=Colin|last=Putt|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|year= 2002|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/15/1037080913844.html|accessdate=2 Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his longstanding interest in old navigational methods used to explore and populate the Pacific, he employed similar techniques for the Tahiti-New Zealand leg of the ''Rehu Moana'' voyage without using a [[compass]], [[sextant]] or [[marine chronometer]].

==Study and literary career==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IceBird Stuck.jpg|thumb|right|''Ice Bird'', stuck in heavy ice.]] --&gt;
In 1967, Lewis acquired another boat, ''Isbjorn'', to embark on further field studies of traditional [[Polynesian navigation]]. With a research grant from the [[Australian National University]] and with his second wife, two daughters and 19-year-old son, he set out for the Pacific again to study traditional navigation techniques.  While there, he was welcomed into the cultures of various [[Pacific Islanders]] such as [[Hipour]], who taught him their navigational lore, heretofore largely unrecognized by those outside Polynesia.  Lewis chronicled this voyage and research in various articles and in his books ''We, the Navigators'' and ''The Voyaging Stars''. 
Lewis’ voyages and resulting books gave inspiration to the revival in traditional Polynesian canoe building and voyaging, which was essentially extinct in many parts of the Pacific. 

In 1976, Lewis joined [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]'s first experimental voyage from Hawaii to Tahiti on ''[[Hokulea|Hokule'a]]''.  But this voyage was marred by a clash of egos between David and the Hawaiian navigators. Nevertheless, the team successfully navigated using traditional methods to Tahiti. Lewis departed from Hokule'a in Tahiti and went on to work in his own research. 

Along with Dr. Marianne (Mimi) George, he proposed that original Polynesian navigation is still alive in the Polynesian outlier [[Taumako]].

Lewis’ next adventure in 1972 was an attempt at circumnavigating [[Antarctica]] single-handed.  For this he acquired a small steel yacht, named ''Ice Bird''.  Facing treacherous conditions in the Southern Ocean after departing, Lewis was not heard from for 13 weeks but eventually managed to sail the ''Ice Bird'' to the Antarctic Peninsula under a jury rig after dismasting. Lewis was rescued by personnel from the Antarctic research outpost [[Palmer Station]], who subsequently repaired the Ice Bird while Lewis spent the Antarctic winter in Australia.

[[File:Ice Bird Trials Off Palmer Station 1973.png|Ice Bird Trials Off Palmer Station 1973]]

After returning eight months later, Lewis left Palmer station to complete the voyage, but that very same day was caught in a heavy ice field and had to be towed to open water by the [[R.V. Hero]]. Later, Lewis capsized again and eventually brought the boat to [[Cape Town]], South Africa.  Edited aspects of these events are described in his bestseller book, ''[[Ice Bird]]''.
His son, Barry, sailed the yacht back to Sydney from South Africa where it underwent extensive work to prevent further corrosion. In 1982, Dr. Lewis donated "Ice Bird" to the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first= Margaret|last=Simpson|publisher=Museum of Applied Arts &amp; Sciences|title=David Lewis' Yacht "Ice Bird"|url= http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=212223|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''Ice Bird'' voyage, Lewis was involved in setting up the Oceanic Research Foundation with the aim of sending private expeditions to the Antarctic.  In a 17.4 metre (57&amp;nbsp;ft) Alan Payne designed steel yacht named "Solo" with seven other crew, Lewis made a summer expedition to Antarctica and wintered over there, 1977-78. Lewis spent some of his later years conducting research into traditional navigation techniques of the Inuit on the Bering Strait region. One obituary said of Lewis that he “always brought his crews home intact. He was a typical Polynesian sailor, getting into trouble through haste and neglect, then, with near superhuman courage and seamanship, fighting his way out of it.”

Following this, he retired to New Zealand to write his autobiography, ''Shapes on the Wind''; one of 12 books he wrote. In recognition of his various academic, adventure, sailing and anthropological endeavours, he was made a Distinguished Companion of the [[New Zealand Order of Merit]]. He finally retired to Australia, and died at Gympie, Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Obituary|publisher=Dominion Post, New Zealand|date=31 October 2002| page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8337">The '''Eastern [[miombo]] woodlands''' (AT0706) are an [[ecoregion]] of grassland and woodland in southern [[Tanzania]] and northern [[Mozambique]].

==Setting==
These species-rich [[savanna]] ecosystems cover wide areas of gentle hills and low valleys containing rivers and [[dambo]] wetlands. The region is located on the [[East African Plateau]], extending from inland south-eastern Tanzania to cover the northern half of Mozambique, with small areas in neighbouring [[Malawi]]. They are a section of the belt of miombo woodland that crosses Africa south of the Congo rain forests and the savannas of East Africa. The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|483,900|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. It is bounded by the [[Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic|Northern]] and [[Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic]] to the east along the [[Indian Ocean]], and by the [[Zambezian and mopane woodlands]] in the Zambezi lowlands to the southwest, and by [[Lake Malawi]] to the west. To the north and northwest, the [[Eastern Arc forests|forested]] [[Eastern Arc Mountains]] separate the eastern miombo woodlands from the [[Southern Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets]] of central Tanzania.

The region has a hot, tropical climate with a wet summer from November to March and a long winter drought. The woodlands are vulnerable to fire, particularly at the start of the summer.

==Flora and fauna==
The predominant tree is [[miombo]] (''[[Brachystegia]]'' spp.), along with [[Baikiaea]] woodland.

Despite the low rainfall and relatively nutrient-poor soil the woodland is home to many species. The miombo and other vegetation in and around the region have historically a variety of food and cover for several miombo specialist endemic bird and lizard species as well as more widespread mammals including herds of [[African elephant]] ''(Loxodonta africana)'', [[giraffe]], [[Burchell's zebra]] ''(Equus burchelli)'', [[wildebeest]] ''(Connochaetes taurinus)'' and [[hippopotamus]] ''(Hippopotamus amphibius)'' and antelopes including [[greater kudu]] ''(Tragelaphus strepsiceros)'', [[Common eland|eland]] ''(Taurotragus oryx)'', [[impala]] ''(Aepyceros melampus)'', Roosevelt [[sable antelope]] ''(Hippotragus niger)'' and [[Lichtenstein's hartebeest]] ''(Sigmoceros lichtensteinii)'' (Campbell 1996). The roan antelope is mysteriously absent from the Eastern Miombo woodlands,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Estes. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and the long dry season and poor soils do not support the large herds of herbivores found further north in Tanzania. Large carnivores in the region include lion (''[[Panthera leo]]''), leopard (''[[Panthera pardus]]''), cheetah (''[[Acinonyx jubatus]]''), spotted hyena (''[[Crocuta crocuta]]'') and side-striped jackal (''[[Canis adustus]]''). The [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'') population of the Selous Game Reserve is the largest known population on the continent

The region is also rich in bird life, including the near-endemic [[Stierling's woodpecker]] as well as other species like [[vulture]]s, [[African fish eagle|fish eagle]], [[kingfisher]], [[yellow billed stork]] and [[plover]].

Reptiles include common [[crocodile]]s while the endemics are the two sub-species of the [[spotted flat lizard]], and the chameleon ''[[Chamaeleon tornieri]]'' (although the validity of this last species classification has been questioned).&lt;ref&gt;J Mariaux, N Lutzman and J Stipala. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecoregion is thinly populated by humans, partly due to [[tsetse fly]] and the [[Mozambique Civil War]], but the miombo woodlands are important to the livelihoods of the rural people, who depend on the resources available from the woodland. The wide variety of species provides non-timber products such as fruits, honey, fodder for livestock and fuelwood. In Tanzania however a large portion of the ecoregion is covered by [[Selous Game Reserve]], the largest protected area in Africa. There are areas of Eastern Miombo woodland in Tanzania south of Selous, in the regions of [[Ruvuma Region|Ruvuma]] and [[Lindi Region|Lindi]]. In Mozambique the region is contained within the sparsely populated [[Niassa Province|Niassa]] and the inland areas of [[Cabo Delgado Province|Cabo Delgado]], [[Nampula Province|Nampula]] and [[Zambezia Province|Zambezia]].

==Conservation and threats==
Selous Game Reserve is a major element of conservation in this ecoregion along with [[Niassa Reserve]] and other national parks in Mozambique, which suffered during the civil war and are in a state of reconstruction.

Even outside protected areas the woodlands have remained comparatively intact due to the sparse human population. However the woodlands are being slowly cleared for farmland and pasture throughout. There is little commercial logging except for the African blackwood ([[Dalbergia melanoxylon]]), whose timber is highly valuable. Poaching of elephant and rhino are a threat, especially in Mozambique.

Many areas of miombo woodland are still managed in traditional ways, with [[slash and burn]] farming systems dominating, but in some areas alternative land management practices are being promoted. One such example is the N'hambita Community Carbon Project in the [[Sofala Province]] of Mozambique. This was developed as a result of the increasing concern about global climate change, and the recent evolution of carbon markets, paired with a need for poverty reduction and alternative livelihoods where rural communities lack the resources to prevent environmental degradation. These carbon markets are part of the '[[Payment for ecosystem services|Payments for Ecosystem services]]' (PES) system and in this case finance from the sale of [[carbon offsets]] is used to incentivise and sustain activities which increase [[carbon sequestration]] and protect existing carbon stocks in forests.

The N'hambita project was launched in 2003 as a collaboration between the environmental company Envirotrade Ltd. and the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miombo.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.envirotrade.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; To date (Jan 2009) the project has engaged 1350 farmers or 'producer's in [[agroforestry]] and woodland restoration and conservation activities. Those involved have benefited from staged payments, continued technical support and have been encouraged to become involved in other micro-finance initiatives, such as beekeeping and carpentry, using miombo tree species planted within the project.

The Plan Vivo&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planvivo.org&lt;/ref&gt; System is used, which was pioneered, and has run successfully in Mexico for over 10 years in the Scolel Te project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planvivo.org/fx.planvivo/scheme/mexico.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519030551/http://www.planvivo.org/fx.planvivo/scheme/mexico.aspx |archivedate=2009-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plan Vivo projects are registered and reviewed under standards developed by the Plan Vivo Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planvivo.org&lt;/ref&gt; Producers who sign up to the scheme must agree to manage their land according to their ''plan vivo'', a long term land management plan evaluated and registered by the local project manager.

An '''ecosystem''' is a [[community (ecology)|community]] made up of living organisms and [[abiotic component|nonliving components]] such as air, water, and mineral soil.&lt;ref&gt;Tansley (1934); Molles (1999), p. 482; Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 380; Schulze ''et al''. (2005); p. 400; Gurevitch ''et al''. (2006), p. 522; Smith &amp; Smith 2012, p. G-5&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems can be studied in two different ways. They can be thought of as interdependent collections of plants and animals, or as structured systems and communities governed by general rules.&lt;ref name="Sagoff2003" /&gt; The living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[abiotic component|abiotic]]) components interact through [[nutrient cycles]] and energy flows.&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;{{cite book |last=Odum |first=Eugene P |date=1971 |title=Fundamentals of Ecology |edition=third |publisher=Saunders |location=New York |isbn=0-53442-066-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems include interactions among organisms, and between organisms and their environment.&lt;ref name = Schulze400&gt;Schulze ''et al''. (2005), p.400&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems can be of any size but each ecosystem has a specific, limited space.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 380; Schulze ''et al''. (2005); p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scientists view the entire planet as one ecosystem.&lt;ref name = "planet"&gt;Willis (1997), p. 269; Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 5; Krebs (2009). p. 572&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy, water, [[nitrogen]] and soil minerals are essential abiotic components of an ecosystem. The energy used by ecosystems comes primarily from the [[sun]], via [[photosynthesis]]. Photosynthesis uses energy from the sun and also captures [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere. [[Animal]]s also play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through ecosystems. They influence the amount of plant and [[microbe|microbial]] [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] that lives in the system. As organic matter dies, carbon is released back into the atmosphere. This process also facilitates [[nutrient cycling]] by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be used again by plants and other microbes.&lt;ref name="Chapin10"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ecosystems are controlled by both external and internal factors. External factors such as [[climate]], the [[parent material]] that forms the soil, [[topography]] and time each affect ecosystems. However, these external factors are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Chapin11"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 11–13&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecosystems are dynamic: they are subject to periodic disturbances and are often in the process of recovering from past [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] and seeking balance.&lt;ref name="Chapin281" /&gt; Internal factors are different: They not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them. Another way of saying this is that internal factors are subject to [[feedback|feedback loops]].&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt;

[[Human]]s operate within ecosystems and can influence both internal and external factors.&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt; [[Global warming]] is an alleged example of a cumulative effect of human activities. Ecosystems provide benefits, called "[[ecosystem services]]", which people depend on for their [[livelihood]]. [[Ecosystem management]] is more efficient than trying to manage individual [[species]].{{TOC limit|3}}

== Definition ==
There is no single definition of what constitutes an ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Sagoff2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sagoff|first=Mark|year=2003|title=The plaza and the pendulum: Two concepts of ecological science|journal=Biology and Philosophy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=529–552|doi=10.1023/A:1025566804906}}&lt;/ref&gt; German ecologist Ernst-Detlef Schulze and coauthors defined an ecosystem as an area which is "uniform regarding the biological turnover, and contains all the fluxes above and below the ground area under consideration." They explicitly reject [[Gene Likens]]' use of entire [[Drainage basin|river catchments]] as "too wide a demarcation" to be a single ecosystem, given the level of heterogeneity within such an area.&lt;ref name="Schulze399"&gt;Schulze ''et al''. 300–402&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have suggested that an ecosystem can encompass a much larger area, even the whole planet.&lt;ref name="planet" /&gt; Schulze and coauthors also rejected the idea that a single rotting log could be studied as an ecosystem because the size of the flows between the log and its surroundings are too large, relative to the proportion cycles within the log.&lt;ref name="Schulze399" /&gt; Philosopher of science Mark Sagoff considers the failure to define "the kind of object it studies" to be an obstacle to the development of theory in [[ecosystem ecology]].&lt;ref name="Sagoff2003" /&gt;

Ecosystems can be studied in a variety of ways. Those include theoretical studies or more practical studies that monitor specific ecosystems over long periods of time or look at differences between ecosystems to better understand how they work. Some studies involve experimenting with direct manipulation of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Carpenter1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=Stephen R.|author2=Jonathan J. Cole|author3=Timothy E.

Carpenter]] has argued that microcosm experiments can be "irrelevant and diversionary" if they are not carried out in conjunction with field studies done at the ecosystem scale.

===Related concepts===

T[[terrestrial ecosystem|errestrial ecosystem]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (found on land) and [[aquatic ecosystems]] (found in water) are concepts related to ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems are split into [[marine ecosystem]]s and [[freshwater ecosystem]]s.

=== External and internal factors ===
Ecosystems are controlled both by external and internal factors. External factors, also called state factors, control the overall structure of an ecosystem and the way things work within it, but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. The most important of these is [[climate]].&lt;ref name="Chapin11"/&gt; Climate determines the [[biome]] in which the ecosystem is embedded. Rainfall patterns and seasonal temperatures influence photosynthesis and thereby determine the amount of water and energy available to the ecosystem.&lt;ref name = "Chapin11"/&gt; 

[[Parent material]] determines the nature of the soil in an ecosystem, and influences the supply of mineral nutrients. [[Topography]] also controls ecosystem processes by affecting things like [[microclimate]], soil development and the movement of water through a system. For example, ecosystems can be quite different if situated in a small depression on the landscape, versus one present on an adjacent steep hillside.&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt;

Other external factors that play an important role in ecosystem functioning include time and potential [[biota (ecology)|biota]]. Similarly, the set of organisms that can potentially be present in an area can also significantly affect ecosystems. Ecosystems in similar environments that are located in different parts of the world can end up doing things very differently simply because they have different pools of species present.&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt; The [[introduced species|introduction of non-native species]] can cause substantial shifts in ecosystem function.

Unlike external factors, internal factors in ecosystems not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them. Consequently, they are often subject to [[feedback|feedback loops]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin11"/&gt; While the [[Resource (biology)|resource]] inputs are generally controlled by external processes like climate and parent material, the availability of these resources within the ecosystem is controlled by internal factors like decomposition, root competition or shading.&lt;ref name = "Chapin11"/&gt; Other factors like disturbance, succession or the types of species present are also internal factors. 

===Primary production===
[[File:Seawifs global biosphere.jpg|upright=1.8|thumb|Global oceanic and terrestrial [[phototroph]] abundance, from September 1997 to August 2000. As an estimate of [[autotroph]] biomass, it is only a rough indicator of primary production potential and not an actual estimate of it.]]
{{main article|Primary production}}
Primary production is the production of [[organic matter]] from inorganic carbon sources. This mainly occurs through [[photosynthesis]]. The energy incorporated through this process supports life on earth, while the carbon makes up much of the organic matter in living and dead biomass, [[soil carbon]] and [[fossil fuel]]s. It also drives the [[carbon cycle]], which influences global [[climate]] via the [[greenhouse effect]].

Through the process of photosynthesis, plants capture energy from light and use it to combine [[carbon dioxide]] and water to produce [[carbohydrate]]s and [[oxygen]]. The photosynthesis carried out by all the plants in an ecosystem is called the gross primary production (GPP).&lt;ref name = "Chapin97"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 97–104&lt;/ref&gt; About 48–60% of the GPP is consumed in plant respiration. 

The remainder, that portion of GPP that is not used up by respiration, is known as the [[net primary production]] (NPP).&lt;ref name="Chapin123"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 123–150&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Energy flow===

{{main article|Energy flow (ecology)}}
{{See also|Food web|Trophic level}}
[[Energy]] and [[carbon]] enter ecosystems through [[photosynthesis]], are incorporated into living tissue, transferred to other organisms that feed on the living and dead plant matter, and eventually released through respiration.&lt;ref name="Chapin123" /&gt;

The carbon and energy incorporated into plant tissues (net primary production) is either consumed by animals while the plant is alive, or it remains uneaten when the plant tissue dies and becomes [[detritus]]. In [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, roughly 90% of the net primary production ends up being broken down by [[decomposition|decomposers]]. The remainder is either consumed by animals while still alive and enters the plant-based trophic system, or it is consumed after it has died, and enters the detritus-based trophic system. 

In [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic systems]], the proportion of plant biomass that gets consumed by [[herbivore]]s is much higher.&lt;ref name="Chapin244"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002) pp. 244–264&lt;/ref&gt;
In trophic systems photosynthetic organisms are the primary producers. The organisms that consume their tissues are called primary consumers or [[secondary production|secondary producers]]—[[herbivores]]. Organisms which feed on [[microbe]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]) are termed [[microbivore]]s. Animals that feed on primary consumers—[[carnivore]]s—are secondary consumers. Each of these constitutes a [[trophic level]].&lt;ref name="Chapin244" /&gt; 

The sequence of consumption—from plant to herbivore, to carnivore—forms a [[food chain]]. Real systems are much more complex than this—organisms will generally feed on more than one form of food, and may feed at more than one trophic level. Carnivores may capture some prey which are part of a plant-based trophic system and others that are part of a detritus-based trophic system (a bird that feeds both on herbivorous grasshoppers and earthworms, which consume detritus). Real systems, with all these complexities, form [[food web]]s rather than food chains.&lt;ref name="Chapin244" /&gt;

====Ecosystem ecology====
{{Main article|Ecosystem ecology}}
{{See also|Ecosystem model}}
[[File:East Scotia Ridge - Plos Biol 04.tif|thumb|right|A [[hydrothermal vent]] is an ecosystem on the ocean floor. (The scale bar is 1 m.)]]
Ecosystem ecology studies "the flow of energy and materials through organisms and the physical environment". It seeks to understand the processes which govern the stocks of material and energy in ecosystems, and the flow of matter and energy through them. The study of ecosystems can cover 10 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]], from the surface layers of rocks to the surface of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 3–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decomposition===
{{See also|Decomposition}}
The carbon and nutrients in [[soil organic matter|dead organic matter]] are broken down by a group of processes known as [[decomposition]]. This releases nutrients that can then be re-used for plant and microbial production and returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere (or water) where it can be used for [[photosynthesis]]. In the absence of decomposition, the dead organic matter would accumulate in an ecosystem, and nutrients and atmospheric carbon dioxide would be depleted.&lt;ref name= Chapin151&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 151–157&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 90% of terrestrial net primary production goes directly from plant to decomposer.&lt;ref name = "Chapin244"/&gt;

Decomposition processes can be separated into three categories—[[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], fragmentation and chemical alteration of dead material. 

==== Leaching ====
As water moves through dead organic matter, it dissolves and carries with it the water-soluble components. These are then taken up by organisms in the soil, react with mineral soil, or are transported beyond the confines of the ecosystem (and are considered lost to it).&lt;ref name="Chapin151" /&gt; Newly shed leaves and newly dead animals have high concentrations of water-soluble components and include [[sugar]]s, [[amino acid]]s and mineral nutrients. Leaching is more important in wet environments and much less important in dry ones.&lt;ref name="Chapin151" /&gt;

==== Fragmentation ====
Fragmentation processes break organic material into smaller pieces, exposing new surfaces for colonization by microbes. Freshly shed [[leaf litter]] may be inaccessible due to an outer layer of [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] or [[Bark (botany)|bark]], and [[protoplasm|cell contents]] are protected by a [[cell wall]]. Newly dead animals may be covered by an [[exoskeleton]]. Fragmentation processes, which break through these protective layers, accelerate the rate of microbial decomposition.&lt;ref name= Chapin151/&gt; Animals fragment detritus as they hunt for food, as does passage through the gut. [[Freeze-thaw cycle]]s and cycles of wetting and drying also fragment dead material.&lt;ref name= Chapin151/&gt;

==== Chemical alteration ====
The chemical alteration of the dead organic matter is primarily achieved through bacterial and fungal action. Fungal [[hypha]]e produce enzymes which can break through the tough outer structures surrounding dead plant material. They also produce enzymes which break down [[lignin]], which allows them access to both cell contents and to the nitrogen in the lignin. Fungi can transfer carbon and nitrogen through their hyphal networks and thus, unlike bacteria, are not dependent solely on locally available resources.&lt;ref name = "Chapin151"/&gt;

==== Decomposition rates ====
{{Further|Decomposition#Rate of decomposition}}
Decomposition rates vary among ecosystems. The rate of decomposition is governed by three sets of factors—the physical environment (temperature, moisture, and soil properties), the quantity and quality of the dead material available to decomposers, and the nature of the microbial community itself.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 159–174&lt;/ref&gt; Temperature controls the rate of microbial respiration; the higher the temperature, the faster microbial decomposition occurs. It also affects soil moisture, which slows microbial growth and reduces leaching. Freeze-thaw cycles also affect decomposition—freezing temperatures kill soil microorganisms, which allows leaching to play a more important role in moving nutrients around. This can be especially important as the soil thaws in the spring, creating a pulse of nutrients which become available.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt;

Decomposition rates are low under very wet or very dry conditions. Decomposition rates are highest in wet, moist conditions with adequate levels of oxygen. Wet soils tend to become deficient in oxygen (this is especially true in [[wetland]]s), which slows microbial growth. In dry soils, decomposition slows as well, but bacteria continue to grow (albeit at a slower rate) even after soils become too dry to support plant growth.

===Nutrient cycling===
{{See also|Nutrient cycle|Biogeochemical cycle}}
[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Biological nitrogen cycling]]
Ecosystems continually exchange energy and carbon with the wider [[environment (systems)|environment]]. Mineral nutrients, on the other hand, are mostly cycled back and forth between plants, animals, microbes and the soil. Most nitrogen enters ecosystems through biological [[nitrogen fixation]], is deposited through precipitation, dust, gases or is applied as [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name="Chapin197"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 197–215&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Nitrogen cycle ====
{{Main|Nitrogen cycle}}

Since most [[terrestrial ecosystems]] are nitrogen-limited, [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen cycling]] is an important control on ecosystem production.&lt;ref name="Chapin197" /&gt;

Until modern times, nitrogen fixation was the major source of nitrogen for ecosystems. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria either live [[symbiosis|symbiotically]] with plants or live freely in the soil. The energetic cost is high for plants which support nitrogen-fixing symbionts—as much as 25% of gross primary production when measured in controlled conditions. Many members of the [[legume]] plant family support nitrogen-fixing symbionts. Some [[cyanobacteria]] are also capable of nitrogen fixation. These are [[phototroph]]s, which carry out photosynthesis. Like other nitrogen-fixing bacteria, they can either be free-living or have symbiotic relationships with plants.&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt; Other sources of nitrogen include [[acid deposition]] produced through the combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, [[ammonia]] gas which evaporates from agricultural fields which have had fertilizers applied to them, and dust.&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt; Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs account for about 80% of all nitrogen fluxes in ecosystems.&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt;

When plant tissues are shed or are eaten, the nitrogen in those tissues becomes available to animals and microbes. Microbial decomposition releases nitrogen compounds from dead organic matter in the soil, where plants, fungi, and bacteria compete for it. Some soil bacteria use organic nitrogen-containing compounds as a source of carbon, and release [[ammonium]] ions into the soil. This process is known as [[ammonification|nitrogen mineralization]]. Others convert ammonium to [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] ions, a process known as [[nitrification]]. [[Nitric oxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are also produced during nitrification.&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt; Under nitrogen-rich and oxygen-poor conditions, nitrates and nitrites are converted to [[nitrogen|nitrogen gas]], a process known as [[denitrification]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt;

==== Other nutrients ====
Other important nutrients include [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]] and [[manganese]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin215"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 215–222&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorus enters ecosystems through [[weathering]]. As ecosystems age this supply diminishes, making phosphorus-limitation more common in older landscapes (especially in the tropics).&lt;ref name = "Chapin215"/&gt; Calcium and sulfur are also produced by weathering, but acid deposition is an important source of sulfur in many ecosystems. Although magnesium and manganese are produced by weathering, exchanges between soil organic matter and living cells account for a significant portion of ecosystem fluxes.

===Function and biodiversity===

[[Biodiversity]] plays an important role in ecosystem functioning.&lt;ref name="Schulze449"&gt;Schulze ''et al''. (2005), pp. 449–453&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that ecosystem processes are driven by the number of species in an ecosystem, the exact nature of each individual species, and the relative abundance organisms within these species.&lt;ref name="Chapin265"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 265–277&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem processes are broad generalizations that actually take place through the actions of individual organisms. The nature of the organisms—the species, [[functional group (ecology)|functional groups]] and trophic levels to which they belong—dictates the sorts of actions these individuals are capable of carrying out and the relative efficiency with which they do so. 

Ecological theory suggests that in order to coexist, species must have some level of [[limiting similarity]]—they must be different from one another in some fundamental way, otherwise one species would [[competitive exclusion|competitively exclude]] the other.&lt;ref name="niche"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoener|first=Thomas W.|title=The Princeton Guide to Ecology|editor=[[Simon A. Levin]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|year=2009|pages=2–13|chapter=Ecological Niche|isbn=978-0-691-12839-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the cumulative effect of additional species in an ecosystem is not linear—additional species may enhance nitrogen retention, for example, but beyond some level of species richness, additional species may have little additive effect.&lt;ref name = "Chapin265"/&gt; 

The addition (or loss) of species which are ecologically similar to those already present in an ecosystem tends to only have a small effect on ecosystem function. Ecologically distinct species, on the other hand, have a much larger effect. Similarly, dominant species have a large effect on ecosystem function, while rare species tend to have a small effect. [[Keystone species]] tend to have an effect on ecosystem function that is disproportionate to their abundance in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Chapin265" /&gt; Similarly, an [[ecosystem engineer]] is any [[organism]] that creates, significantly modifies, maintains or destroys a [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]].

===Dynamics===

Ecosystems are dynamic entities. They are subject to periodic disturbances and are in the process of recovering from some past disturbance.&lt;ref name="Chapin281"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|last=Chapin|first=F. Stuart|author2=Pamela A. Matson|author3=Harold A. Mooney|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-387-95443-0|location=New York|pages=281–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a [[perturbation (biology)|perturbation]] occurs, an ecoystem responds by moving away from its initial state. The tendency of an ecosystem to remain close to its equilibrium state, despite that disturbance, is termed its [[resistance (ecology)|resistance]]. On the other hand, the speed with which it returns to its initial state after disturbance is called its [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt; Time plays a role in the development of soil from bare rock and the [[ecological succession|recovery of a community from disturbance]].&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt;

From one year to another, ecosystems experience variation in their biotic and abiotic environments. A drought, an especially cold winter and a pest outbreak all constitute short-term variability in environmental conditions. Animal populations vary from year to year, building up during resource-rich periods and crashing as they overshoot their food supply. These changes play out in changes in [[net primary production]] [[decomposition]] rates, and other ecosystem processes.&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt; Longer-term changes also shape ecosystem processes—the forests of eastern North America still show legacies of cultivation which ceased 200 years ago, while [[methane]] production in eastern [[Siberia|Siberian]] lakes is controlled by organic matter which accumulated during the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt;

[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]] also plays an important role in ecological processes. [[F. Stuart Chapin III|F. Stuart Chapin]] and coauthors define disturbance as "a relatively discrete event in time and space that alters the structure of populations, communities, and ecosystems and causes changes in resources availability or the physical environment".&lt;ref name = "Chapin 285"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; This can range from tree falls and insect outbreaks to hurricanes and wildfires to volcanic eruptions. Such disturbances can cause large changes in plant, animal and microbe populations, as well soil organic matter content.&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt; Disturbance is followed by [[ecological succession|succession]], a "directional change in ecosystem structure and functioning resulting from biotically driven changes in resources supply."&lt;ref name = "Chapin 285"/&gt;

The frequency and severity of disturbance determine the way it affects ecosystem function. A major disturbance like a volcanic eruption or [[Glacier|glacial]] advance and retreat leave behind soils that lack plants, animals or organic matter. Ecosystems that experience such disturbances undergo [[primary succession]]. A less severe disturbance like forest fires, hurricanes or cultivation result in [[secondary succession]] and a faster recovery.&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt; More severe disturbance and more frequent disturbance result in longer recovery times.

==Classification methods==
{{See also|Ecosystem diversity|Ecoregion|Ecological land classification|Ecotope}}

Classifying ecosystems into ecologically homogeneous units is an important step towards effective ecosystem management.&lt;ref name="Lugo1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lugo|first=A. E.|author2=S.L.

A variety of systems exist, based on vegetation cover, remote sensing, and [[Holdridge life zones|bioclimatic classification]] systems.&lt;ref name = "Lugo1999"/&gt; 

[[Ecological land classification]] is a cartographical delineation or [[regionalisation]] of distinct [[ecology|ecological]] areas, identified by their [[geology]], [[topography]], [[soil]]s, [[vegetation]], [[climate]] conditions, living species, [[habitat]]s, water resources, and sometimes also [[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellogg|first=Charles|title=A Method for the Classification of Rural Lands for Assessment in Western North Dakota|journal=The Journal of Land &amp; Public Utility Economics|date=February 1933|volume=9|issue=1|page=12|jstor=3138756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human activities==
Human activities are important in almost all ecosystems. Although humans exist and operate within ecosystems, their cumulative effects are large enough to influence external factors like climate.&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt;

===Ecosystem goods and services===

[[Ecosystem services]], on the other hand, are generally "improvements in the condition or location of things of value".&lt;ref name="Brown2007" /&gt; These include things like the maintenance of hydrological cycles, cleaning air and water, the maintenance of oxygen in the atmosphere, crop [[pollination]] and even things like beauty, inspiration and opportunities for research.&lt;ref name="Christensen1998" /&gt; While ecosystem goods have traditionally been recognized as being the basis for things of economic value, ecosystem services tend to be taken for granted.&lt;ref name="Brown2007" /&gt;

===Ecosystem management===
{{Main article|Ecosystem management}}
{{See also|Ecological economics|Sustainability|Sustainable development}}
When [[natural resource management]] is applied to whole ecosystems, rather than single species, it is termed [[ecosystem management]].&lt;ref name="Grumbine1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grumbine |first=R.

While ecosystem management can be used as part of a plan for [[wilderness]] conservation, it can also be used in intensively managed ecosystems&lt;ref name="Christensen1998"/&gt; (see, for example, [[agroecosystem]] and [[close to nature forestry]]).

===Threats caused by humans===
{{see also|Planetary boundaries}}
As human population and per capita consumption grow, so do the resource demands imposed on ecosystems and the effects of the human [[ecological footprint]]. Natural resources are vulnerable and limited. The environmental impacts of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] actions are becoming more apparent. Problems for all ecosystems include: [[Pollution|environmental pollution]], [[climate change]] and [[biodiversity loss]]. For [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial ecosystems]] further threats include [[air pollution]], [[Soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]],  and [[deforestation]]. For [[aquatic ecosystems]] threats include also unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (for example [[overfishing]] of certain species), [[marine pollution]], [[microplastics]] pollution, [[water pollution]], and building on coastal areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 0-412-74050-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Society is increasingly becoming aware that [[ecosystem services]] are not only limited but also that they are threatened by human activities. The need to better consider long-term [[ecosystem health]] and its role in enabling human habitation and economic activity is urgent. To help inform decision-makers, many ecosystem services are being assigned economic values, often based on the cost of replacement with anthropogenic alternatives. The ongoing challenge of prescribing economic value to nature, for example through [[biodiversity banking]], is prompting transdisciplinary shifts in how we recognize and manage the environment, [[social responsibility]], business opportunities, and our future as a species.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== History ==
The term "ecosystem" was first used in 1935 in a publication by British ecologist [[Arthur Tansley]].&lt;ref group="fn"&gt;The term ecosystem was actually coined by [[Arthur Roy Clapham]], who came up with the word at Tansley's request (Willis 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Willis1997"&gt;Willis (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Tansley devised the concept to draw attention to the importance of transfers of materials between organisms and their environment.&lt;ref name = "Chapin7"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 7–11)&lt;/ref&gt; He later refined the term, describing it as "The whole system, ... including not only the organism-complex, but also the whole complex of physical factors forming what we call the environment".&lt;ref name="Tansley1935"&gt;Tansley (1935)&lt;/ref&gt; Tansley regarded ecosystems not simply as natural units, but as "mental isolates".&lt;ref name="Tansley1935" /&gt; Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term [[ecotope]].&lt;ref name="Tansley1939"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1io8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|title=The British Islands and Their Vegetation|last=Tansley|first=A.G.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1939|authorlink=Arthur Tansley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]], a [[limnologist]] who was a contemporary of Tansley's, combined [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]]'s ideas about [[Trophic level|trophic]] ecology with those of Russian geochemist [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]. As a result, he suggested that mineral nutrient availability in a lake limited [[Algal bloom|algal production]]. This would, in turn, limit the abundance of animals that feed on algae. [[Raymond Lindeman]] took these ideas further to suggest that the flow of energy through a lake was the primary driver of the ecosystem. Hutchinson's students, brothers [[Howard T. Odum]] and [[Eugene P. Odum]], further developed a "systems approach" to the study of ecosystems. This allowed them to study the flow of energy and material through ecological systems.&lt;ref name = "Chapin7"/&gt;

Most '''energy in [[Israel]]''' comes from [[hydrocarbon]] fuels. The country's total [[primary energy]] demand is significantly higher than its total primary energy production, relying heavily on imports to meet its energy needs. Total primary energy consumption was {{convert|285.5|TWh|quad|abbr=on|lk=on}} in 2011, or 24.5&amp;nbsp;Mtoe (million [[tonne of oil equivalent]]).&lt;!--285.5 TWh--&gt;&lt;ref name="eia" /&gt;

Electricity consumption in Israel was 59.83&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2014, while production was 64.44&amp;nbsp;TWh, with net exports of 4.94&amp;nbsp;TWh.&lt;ref name="ciawf" /&gt; The installed generating capacity was about 16.25&amp;nbsp;GW in the same year, almost all from hydrocarbon fuel plants, mostly coal and gas fueled.&lt;ref name="ciawf" /&gt; [[Renewable energy]] accounted for a minor share of electricity production, with a small [[Solar PV|photovoltaic]] installed capacity. However, there are a total of over 1.3 million [[solar water heater]]s installed as a result of mandatory solar water heating regulations.

==History==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 33882 Geography of Israel.JPG|thumb|Pinhas Rutenberg's power station, [[Naharayim]]]]
Throughout Israel's history, securing the energy supply had been a major concern of Israeli policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2015/02/israel-energy-island-natural-gas|title=The energy island: Israel deals with its natural gas discoveries|first=Tim Boersma and Natan|last=Sachs|website=Brookings.edu|access-date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Israel Electric Corporation]], which traces its history to 1923, is the main electricity generator and distributor in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Shamir, Ronen (2013). Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Petroleum exploration began in 1947 on a surface feature in the [[Heletz]] area in the southern coastal plain. The first discovery, Heletz-I, was completed in 1955, followed by  the discovery and development of a few small wells in Kokhav, Brur, [[Ashdod]] and Zuk Tamrur in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mepc.org/journal/middle-east-policy-archives/israels-energy-security-regional-implications?print|title=Israel's Energy Security: Regional Implications - Middle East Policy Council|website=www.MEPC.org|access-date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined Heletz-Brur-Kokhav field produced a total of 17.2 million barrels, a negligible amount compared with national consumption. Since the early 1950s, 480 oil and gas wells, land and offshore were drilled in Israel, most of which did not result in commercial success. In 1958–1961, several small gas fields were discovered in the southern [[Judean desert]]. From the [[Six-Day War]] until the Egyptian Separation Treaty  in 1975, Israel produced large quantities of petroleum from the Abu Rodes oil field in Sinai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov.il/ENGLISH/SUBJECTS/OILANDGASEXPLORATION/Pages/GxmsMniPetroleumAndNaturalGasProspecting.aspx|title=Petroleum and Natural Gas Prospecting|website=Energy.gov.il|access-date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the Arab states accused American oil interests in Saudi Arabia of selling oil to Central American governments who circumvented the Arab blockade against Israel by selling the oil back to the refinery in [[Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Corpus Christi Times, August 4 1951| accessdate = 2018-07-01| url = https://newspaperarchive.com/anonymous-politics-clipping-aug-04-1951-735828/ | via=[[NewspaperARCHIVE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Israel’s creation in 1948, it has been dependent on energy imports from other countries.&lt;ref name = "blanche"&gt;Blanche, Ed. "Israeli Gas Finds Could Prove A Game Changer." ''Middle East'' 416 (2010): 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Israel produced 7 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 2013, and imported 720 million cubic meters in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html ''The World Factbook 2013-14'']. Washington, DC: Central Intelligence Agency, 2013. &lt;/ref&gt; 
Historically, Israel has imported natural gas through the [[Arab Gas Pipeline|Arish-Ashkelon pipeline]] from [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name = "israel"&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=is "Israel - Country Analysis Note."] U.S. Energy Information Administration, March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Egypt is the second-largest natural gas producer in North Africa. In 2005 Egypt signed a 2.5 billion-dollar deal to supply Israel with 57 billion cubic feet of gas per year for fifteen years.&lt;ref name = "An"&gt;Antreasyan, Anaïs. "Gas Finds in the Eastern Mediterranean" ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', Vol. 42, No. 3 (Spring 2013), pp. 29–47&lt;/ref&gt; Under this arrangement, Egypt supplies 40 percent of Israel's natural gas demand.&lt;ref name="An" /&gt; 
The [[Israeli Electric Corporation]] (IEC) controls more than 95% of the electricity sector in Israel, and controls production, distribution, and transmission of electricity. The IEC has a natural gas distribution law which regulates the distribution of natural gas in Israel to empower market competition.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Shalom, Jeremy. "Israel: National Report for CDS" - 14/15 Thematic Areas.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The discoveries of the [[Tamar gas field]] in 2009 and the [[Leviathan gas field]] in 2010 off the coast of Israel were important. The natural gas reserves in these two fields (Leviathan has around 19 trillion cubic feet)&lt;ref name=israel /&gt; could make Israel energy secure for more than 50 years. In 2013 Israel began commercial production of natural gas from the Tamar field.

Energy Minister [[Yuval Steinitz]] said “For many decades, the Arabs used the fact that they’re supplying Europe with oil and natural gas in order to try to pressure Israel...And now we will have something to balance and influence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Energy-Minister-Natural-gas-can-transform-Israels-geopolitical-status-515293|title=Energy Minister: Natural gas can transform Israel’s geopolitical status|website=JPost.com|access-date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity==
{{see also|Economy of Israel#Electricity}}
In 2015, energy consumption in Israel was 52.86&amp;nbsp;TWh,&lt;ref name="iea2015-52" /&gt; or 6,562&amp;nbsp;kWh per capita.&lt;ref name="iea2015-53" /&gt; The [[Israel Electric Corporation]] (IEC) is the main producer of electricity in Israel, with a production capacity of 11,900&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]]s.&lt;ref name="globes-production" /&gt; In 2016, IEC's share of the electricity market was 71%.&lt;ref name="calcalist1" /&gt;

===Hydrocarbon fuels===

===Renewable energy===
{{update|section|date=April 2018}}
{{see also|Solar power in Israel}}
Renewable energy in Israel is produced in [[solar field]]s, such as [[Energix Renewable Energies]]' Neot Hovav and [[Ketura Sun]] and from [[biogas]] (11 MW), [[hydroelectricity]] (6.6 MW) and [[wind power]] in the [[Golan Heights Wind Farm]] (6 MW). 

Despite getting more than 300 days of sunshine per year, {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, less than 2% of Israel‘s electricity comes from renewable sources. According to the Green Energy Association of Israel, the number of solar energy companies in the country has fallen from about 130 in 2010 to 60 in 2015. The Association says that discoveries of large amounts of natural gas since 2009 have dimmed the government's interest in renewable energy. Officially, however, Israel maintains it will achieve its goal of 10% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel's 300 Days of Sun No Help as Offshore Gas Eclipses Solar|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-10/israel-s-300-days-of-sun-no-help-as-offshore-gas-eclipses-solar|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear energy===
{{main|Nuclear energy in Israel}}
Although there is a fully functional [[heavy water]] [[nuclear reactor]] at [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]], {{as of|2013}} [[Israel]] has no [[nuclear power plants]].  However, in January 2007, [[Israeli Infrastructure Minister]] [[Binyamin Ben-Eliezer]] said his country should consider producing nuclear power for civilian purposes.&lt;ref name=israel2&gt;{{cite web | publisher= [[Agence France-Presse]] |url= http://www.energy-daily.com/reports/Israel_Should_Develop_Nuclear_Energy_999.html | title = Israel Should Develop Nuclear Energy | date = 2007-01-23 | accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[International reaction to Fukushima I nuclear accidents|nuclear emergencies at Japan's Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]], Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] said on March 17, 2011, "I don't think we're going to pursue civil nuclear energy in the coming years."&lt;ref&gt;[http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/17/israel-prime-minister-netanyahu-japan-situation-has-caused-me-to-reconsider-nuclear-power/ Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu: Japan situation has "caused me to reconsider" nuclear power] [[Piers Morgan]] on [[CNN]], published 2011-03-17, accessed 2011-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-03/18/c_13784578.htm Israeli PM cancels plan to build nuclear plant], [[Xinhuanet]], published 2011-03-18, accessed 2011-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4043982,00.html Netanyahu: We'll reconsider nuclear power plans] [[Ynetnews]], published 2011-03-18, accessed 2011-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar water heating==
{{see also|Solar power in Israel}}
[[File:Solarboiler.jpg|thumb|150px|Roof-top solar boilers in [[Jerusalem]]]]
Israel is one of the world leaders in the use of solar thermal energy per capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neaman.org.il/neaman/publications/publication_item.asp?fid=590&amp;parent_fid=490&amp;iid=3639 The Samuel Neaman Institute for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology &amp;mdash; Publications &amp;mdash; Solar energy for the production of heat Summary and recommendations of the 4th assembly of the energy forum at SNI]&lt;/ref&gt;
As of the early 1990s, all new residential buildings were required by the government to install solar water-heating systems, and Israel's National Infrastructure Ministry estimates that solar panels for water-heating satisfy 4% of the country's total energy demand.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite news |title=At the Zenith of Solar Energy |first=Neal |last=Sandler |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-03-26/at-the-zenith-of-solar-energybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice |newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=26 March 2008 |accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Israel and Cyprus are the per-capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90% of homes using them.&lt;ref name="Environment California SWH"&gt;{{cite web| author=Del Chiaro, Bernadette|author2=Telleen-Lawton, Timothy | title=Solar Water Heating (How California Can Reduce Its Dependence on Natural Gas)| publisher=Environment California Research and Policy Center| url= http://www.environmentcalifornia.org/uploads/at/56/at563bKwmfrtJI6fKl9U_w/Solar-Water-Heating.pdf | accessdate=2007-09-29|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovakia is net energy importer. The share of import was 63% of the primary energy use in 2009.&lt;ref name=IEA2010/&gt; (IEA Key stats 2010 pages 52)

==Fossil fuels==

=== Oil===
[[Slovnaft]] is the largest [[oil refinery]] in [[Slovakia]].

===Natural gas ===
[[Slovenský plynárenský priemysel]] (Slovak Gas Industry) is the main natural gas supplier in Slovakia.

==Nuclear Energy==

Four operating reactors in two power plants ([[Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant]] and [[Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant]]) produced 14,42 [[TW·h]] in 2014. Three other reactors at Bohunice are in permanent shutdown. Two other reactors are under construction at Mochovce.

==Renewable energy ==

=== Wind power ===
In the end of 2010 [[wind power]] capacity in Slovakia 3 MW was the lowest of the EU countries, except [[wind power in Malta|Malta]] and Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/statistics/EWEA_Annual_Statistics_2010.pdf Wind in power 2010 European statistics] [[EWEA]] February 2011 pages 4 and 11&lt;/ref&gt; EWEA’s targets are to produce 14-17% of the EU’s electricity with wind power in 2020, and save €28 billion a year in fuel costs in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wind Energy Factsheets, European Wind Energy Association  2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change==
Emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] in total, per capita in 2007 were 6.8 tons CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compared to EU 27 average 7.9 tons {{CO2}}. Emission change 2007/1990 (%) was -35.1%. In Europe in 2007 the Slovak emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] per capita (6.8 tons CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) were higher than in Hungary 5.4, Sweden 5.1, Portugal 5.2 or Switzerland 5.6 and lower than in Czech Republic 11.8, Luxembourg 22.4, Finland 12.2, Netherlands 11.1, Germany 9.7 or Ireland 10.1&lt;ref&gt;[http://webbshop.cm.se/System/TemplateView.aspx?p=Energimyndigheten&amp;view=default&amp;cat=/Broschyrer&amp;id=e0a2619a83294099a16519a0b5edd26f  Energy in Sweden 2010]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016045634/http://webbshop.cm.se/System/TemplateView.aspx?p=Energimyndigheten&amp;view=default&amp;cat=%2FBroschyrer&amp;id=e0a2619a83294099a16519a0b5edd26f |date=October 16, 2013 }}, Table 1: Emissions of carbon dioxide in total, per capita and per GDP in EU and OECD countries, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

1990 emissions were 74 Mt {{CO2}}&lt;sub&gt; eq&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[Kyoto protocol]] target is reduction of 6 Mt (-8%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/reports/20110909_ClimateReport.pdf Wind energy and EU climate policy Achieving 30% lower emissions by 2020] EWEA October 2011 p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

China is the largest producer of [[hydroelectricity]], [[solar power]] and [[wind power]] in the world.

Energy policymaking in China is largely decentralised. 
There has been no Ministry of Energy since it was dissolved in 1993, and it was only in 2002–2003 that serious governmental dialogue on re-centralising energy administration began.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Dansie|last2=Marc|first2=Lanteigne|last3=Overland|first3=Indra|date=2010-02-01|title=Reducing Energy Subsidies in China, India and Russia: Dilemmas for Decision Makers |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41667826 |journal=Sustainability|volume=2|doi=10.3390/su2020475}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
China’s energy industries are governed by a number of ministries and commissions, and companies with varying levels of power and influence, such as the [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] (CNPC) and the [[China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation]] (Sinopec). 
Both of these companies originally comprised one ministry before being converted to state companies in the 1980s. 
They have retained the same hierarchical rank as government ministries, putting them higher than the sub-ministerial bureau charged with supervising them.&lt;ref&gt;Haley, U.C.

These complicated organisational structures and interrelationships complicate any efforts to change the way energy is priced and billed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Image:CO2 per capita per country.png|thumb|300px|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission per capita per year per country (2000 data)]]

On June 19, 2007, the [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] announced that a preliminary study had indicated that China's greenhouse gas emissions for 2006 had exceeded those of the United States for the first time. The agency calculated that China’s [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions from [[fossil fuel]]s increased by 9% in 2006, while those of the United States fell by 1.4%, compared to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Initial National Communication on Climate Change of the People's Republic of China calculated that carbon dioxide emissions in 2004 had risen to approximately 5.05&amp;nbsp;billion metric tons, with total greenhouse gas emissions reaching about 6.1&amp;nbsp;billion metric tons [[carbon dioxide equivalent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since 2006, China has overtaken the USA, producing 8% more emissions than the US to become the worlds biggest emitter of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbl.nl/en/dossiers/Climatechange/moreinfo/Chinanowno1inCO2emissionsUSAinsecondposition |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211033924/http://www.pbl.nl/en/dossiers/Climatechange/moreinfo/Chinanowno1inCO2emissionsUSAinsecondposition |archivedate=December 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy use and carbon emissions by sector===
In the industrial sector, six industries – electricity generation, steel, non-ferrous metals, construction materials, oil processing and chemicals – account for nearly 70% of energy use.&lt;ref name="X-EnergyEfficiency07-06-03"/&gt;

In the construction materials sector, China produced about 44% of the world's cement in 2006.&lt;ref name="NEAA070619b"/&gt; Cement production produces more carbon emissions than any other industrial process, accounting for around 4% of global carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="NEAA070619b"/&gt;

===National Action Plan on Climate Change===
China has been taking action on climate change for some years, with the publication on June 4, 2007 of China's first National Action Plan on Climate Change,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and in that year China became the first [[developing country]] to publish a national strategy addressing [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="X-NAP"&gt;{{citation

|date= 2007-06-04 
|accessdate= 2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan did not include targets for carbon dioxide emission reductions, but it has been estimated that, if fully implemented, China's annual emissions of greenhouse gases would be reduced by 1.5&amp;nbsp;billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2010.&lt;ref name="X-NAP"/&gt; Other commentators, however, put the figure at 0.950&amp;nbsp;billion metric tons.&lt;ref name="Bloom07-06-04"&gt;{{cite web

The publication of the strategy was officially announced during a meeting of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], which called on governments and all sectors of the economy to implement the plan, and for the launch of a public [[environmental protection]] awareness campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Coal remains the foundation of the Chinese energy system, covering close to 70 percent of the country’s primary energy needs and representing 80 percent of the fuel used in electricity generation. Coal has grown rapidly in importance in recent years along with the rising demand for electricity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2011, according to the IEA, Chinese coal production was equivalent to 3,576 Mt*0.522 toe/Mt*11.630 TWh/toe = 21,709 TWh. Assuming the same caloric value for the imported coal, the net coal energy available would be 22,784 TWh. Equally calculated available coal was 17,000 TWh in 2008 and 22,800 TWh in 2011, with increase of 5,800 TWh in three years. Total renewable energy in China was 3,027 TWh in 2008 and 2,761 TWh in 2005, with increase of 266 TWh in three years. Same period from 2005 to 2008 annual coal use increased 3,341 TWh.

China's [[coal mining|coal]] supply was in 2009 18,449 TWh which was 47% of the world coal supply.&lt;ref name=energisve2010Coal&gt;{{cite web |url = http://webbshop.cm.se/System/TemplateView.aspx?p=Energimyndigheten&amp;view=default&amp;cat=/Broschyrer&amp;id=e0a2619a83294099a16519a0b5edd26f |title = Energy in Sweden 2010, Facts and figures Table 52 Global supply of coal, 1990–2009 (TWh) |year = 2010

China is the world's top coal producer and ranks third in the amounts of coal reserves. It is approximately self-sufficient in coal, with a production of 2.38&amp;nbsp;billion ton and a consumption of 2.37&amp;nbsp;billion tons in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200704/19/eng20070419_367873.html |title=China's coal imports hit new high |publisher=Peoples Daily Online |date=2007-04-19|accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 China was second highest hard coal importer (157 Mt).&lt;ref name="IEA2010a2011"/&gt;

China consumes more coal than any other country. Its share of the world coal production was 48% in 2009 and 28% in 2000. Coal use in the world increased 48% from 2000 to 2009. In practice, the majority of this growth occurred in China and the rest in other parts of Asia.&lt;ref name="energisve2010Coal"/&gt; In China, Coal usage double between 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New study blames 10-year lull in global warming on China coal use, air pollution |author=Andrew Freedman |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/new-study-blames-10-year-lull-in-global-warming-on-china-coal-use-air-pollution/2011/07/05/gHQAwjV8yH_blog.html |newspaper=Washington Post |date=5 July 2011 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although China is still a major crude oil producer, it became an oil importer in the 1990s. China became dependent on imported oil for the first time in its history in 1993 due to demand rising faster than domestic production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2002, annual crude petroleum production was 1,298,000,000 barrels, and annual crude petroleum consumption was 1,670,000,000 barrels.

Three state-owned oil companies – [[Sinopec]], [[CNPC]], and [[CNOOC]] – dominate its domestic market.

China announced on June 20, 2008 plans to raise petrol, diesel and aviation kerosene prices. This decision appeared to reflect a need to reduce the unsustainably high level of subsidies these fuels attract, given the global trend in the price of oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/natural_resources/article4175391.ece Rise in global oil price dents China's petrol subsidy policy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612055352/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/natural_resources/article4175391.ece |date=June 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's natural gas supply was 1,015 TWh in 2009 that was 3% of the world supply.&lt;ref name="energiläget2010G"&gt;[http://webbshop.cm.se/System/TemplateView.aspx?p=Energimyndigheten&amp;view=default&amp;cat=/Broschyrer&amp;id=e0a2619a83294099a16519a0b5edd26f Energy in Sweden 2010, Facts and figures]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016045634/http://webbshop.cm.se/System/TemplateView.aspx?p=Energimyndigheten&amp;view=default&amp;cat=%2FBroschyrer&amp;id=e0a2619a83294099a16519a0b5edd26f |date=October 16, 2013 }} Table 50  Global supply of gas 1990–2009 (TWh)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNPC]], [[Sinopec]], and [[CNOOC]] are all active in the upstream gas sector, as well as in [[LNG]] import, and in midstream pipelines. Branch pipelines and urban networks are run by city gas companies including [[China Gas|China Gas Holdings]], [[ENN Energy]], [[Towngas China]], [[Beijing Enterprises Holdings]] and [[Kunlun Energy]].

Issued by China’s State Council in September 2013, China’s Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution illustrates government desire to increase the share of natural gas in China’s energy mix.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In May 2014 China signed a 30-year deal with Russia to deliver 38 billion cubic metres of natural gas each year.&lt;ref&gt;38 billion cubic metres of natural gas&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russia’s energy policy''' is set out in the government’s ''Energy Strategy'' document, first approved in 2000, which sets out the government’s policy to 2020. The Energy Strategy outlines several key priorities: an increase in [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]], reducing the impact on the [[natural environment|environment]], [[sustainable development]], [[energy development]] and technological development, as well as improved effectiveness and competitiveness.

In July 2008 Russia's president signed a law allowing the government to allocate strategic oil and gas deposits on the [[continental shelf]] without an [[auction]] procedure. On 17 February 2011, Russia signed a deal with China, stating that in return for $25 billion in Chinese loans to Russian oil companies, Russia will supply China with large quantities of crude oil via new pipelines for the next 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.caijing.com.cn/2009-02-18/110070270.html China, Russia Ink Oil Loan Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, oil and gas comprise over 60% of Russia's exports and account for over 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030315/how-does-price-oil-affect-russias-economy.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Russian energy policy of pumping 10.6 million barrels of oil a day&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/russia-sees-2015-oil-output-at-10-6-million-barrels-per-day/513149.html&lt;/ref&gt; is nearly 4 billion barrels annually.  Russia’s proven oil reserves are 100 billion barrels. It’s available hydrocarbon potential will be able to provide the nation’s growing economy for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rt.com/business/russia-oil-gas-reserves-putin-015/&lt;/ref&gt;  Russia's energy policy and a finite, depleting amount of oil and pumping more oil at a low oil price, creates issues for Russia's economy today and in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2015/05/14/a-russian-crisis-with-no-end-in-sight-thanks-to-low-oil-prices-and-sanctions/&lt;/ref&gt;

As percentages of the world's total reserves, Russia holds 45% of the gas, 23% of the coal, 14% of the uranium, and 13% of the oil. Russian oil production and export had increased significantly since 2000, and in 2006 temporarily exceeded Saudi Arabia’s production. Since 2016, Russia is the top [[List of countries by oil production|crude oil producer]]. Russia is also the world’s largest energy producer. 

Russia is not a member of [[OPEC]] (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and presents itself as an alternative to Middle Eastern energy resources, asserting that it is in fact a "reliable energy supplier and that it only seeks to use its position as an important supplier to enhance global energy security".&lt;ref&gt;8.

The [[Economy of Russia|Russian economy]] is heavily dependent on the export of natural resources such as oil and natural gas, and Russia has used these resources to its political advantage.&lt;ref name=PFinn&gt;{{Cite news|title = Russia's State-Controlled Gas Firm Announces Plan to Double Price for Georgia|publisher = Washington Post|date = 2007-11-03|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/02/AR2006110201520.html|accessdate= 2014-12-25|first=Peter|last=Finn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gas&gt;{{Cite news|title =Putin's 'Last and Best Weapon' Against Europe: Gas |date = 2014-09-24|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/10/03/putins-last-and-best-weapon-against-europe-gas-272652.html |accessdate= 2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the US and other Western countries have worked to lessen the dependency of Europe on Russia and its resources.&lt;ref name=BKlapper&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klapper|first1=Bradley|title=New Cold War: US, Russia fight over Europe's energy future|url=https://news.yahoo.com/cold-war-us-russia-fight-191709484.html|accessdate=12 February 2015|publisher=Yahoo|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the mid-2000s, Russia and Ukraine had several [[Russia–Ukraine gas disputes|disputes]] in which Russia threatened to cut off the supply of gas. As a great deal of Russia's gas is exported to Europe through the pipelines crossing Ukraine, those disputes affected several other European countries. Under Putin, special efforts were made to gain control over the [[Russia in the European energy sector|European energy sector]].&lt;ref name="BKlapper"/&gt; Russian influence played a major role in canceling the construction of the [[Nabucco pipeline]], which would have supplied natural gas from [[Azerbaijan]], in favor of [[South Stream]] (though South Stream itself was also later canceled).&lt;ref name=JYard&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yardley|first1=Jim|last2=Becker|first2=Jo|title=How Putin Forged a Pipeline Deal That Derailed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/world/europe/how-putin-forged-a-pipeline-deal-that-derailed-.html?module=ArrowsNav&amp;contentCollection=Europe&amp;action=keypress&amp;region=FixedLeft&amp;pgtype=article|accessdate=2 January 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia has also sought to create a [[Eurasian Economic Union]] consisting of itself and other post-Soviet countries.&lt;ref name=LNey&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neyfakh|first1=Leon|title=Putin’s long game?

==Energy Strategy ==
{{See also|Energy policy of the Soviet Union}}
The economy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was based on a system of state ownership of the means of production, [[collective farming]], industrial manufacturing and [[planned economy|centralized administrative planning]]. The economy was characterized by state control of investment, and public ownership of industrial assets. The Soviet Union invested heavily into infrastructure projects including the electrification of vast areas, and the construction and maintenance of natural gas and oil pipelines that stretch out of Russia and into every constituent nations of the USSR. This type of investment set the stage for Russia to become an [[energy superpower]].&lt;ref name=superpowerstatus&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher= Cambridge University Press | author=Davies, R. W | title = The Economic Transformation of the Soviet Union, 1913–1945 | url=  | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a Russian national energy policy was approved by the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]] in 1992, and the government decided to develop the Energy Strategy.&lt;ref name=energypolicy&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=World Energy Council |author1=Y. Bushuyev |author2=A. Makarov |author3=A. Mastepanov |author4=N. Shamrayev |title=A New Energy Policy of Russia: Implementation Experience |url=http://217.206.197.194:8190/wec-geis/publications/default/tech_papers/17th_congress/4_2_06.asp |accessdate=2008-03-03 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose the Interagency Commission was established.

In December 1994, the ''Energy Strategy of Russia (Major Provisions)'' was approved by the government, followed by the [[presidential decree]] of 7 May 1995 that outlined the first post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Russian energy strategy ''On the Main Directions of Energy Policy and Restructuring of the Fuel and Energy Industry of the Russian Federation for the Period up to the Year 2010'', and the government′s decision of 13 October 1995 that approved the ''Main provisions for the Energy Strategy of the Russian Federation''.&lt;ref name=fredholm&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Conflict Studies Research Centre, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom |author=Michael Fredholm |title=A New Energy Policy of Russia: Implementation Experience |url=http://www.defac.ac.uk/colleges/csrc/document-listings/russian/05(41)-MF.pdf |format=PDF |isbn=1-905058-37-3 |date=September 2005 |accessdate=2008-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129125042/http://www.defac.ac.uk/colleges/csrc/document-listings/russian/05(41)-MF.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategy was amended under the presidency of [[Vladimir Putin]]. On 23 November 2000, the government approved the main provisions of the Russian energy strategy to 2020. On 28 May 2002, the [[Ministry of Energy (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Energy]] gave an elaboration on the main provisions. Based on these documents, the new Russian energy strategy up to 2020 was approved on 23 May 2003 and confirmed by the government on 28 August 2003. The main objective of the energy strategy was defined as reaching a better quality of fuel and energy mix and enhancing the competitiveness of Russian energy production and services in the world market. To that end, the long-term energy policy was to concentrate on energy safety, energy effectiveness, budget effectiveness and ecological energy security.&lt;ref&gt;name=summary&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation |title=The Summary of the Energy Strategy of Russia for the Period of up to 2020 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/russia/events/doc/2003_strategy_2020_en.pdf |format=PDF |date=March 2003 |accessdate=2008-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129125038/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/russia/events/doc/2003_strategy_2020_en.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Energy Strategy defines the main priority of Russian energy strategy as an increase in [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]] (meaning decreasing of [[energy intensity]] in production and energy supply expenditures), reducing impact on the [[natural environment|environment]], [[sustainable development]], [[energy development]] and technological development, as well as an improvement of effectiveness and competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, John. "Russia's Energy Diplomacy." . Chatham House, 1 May 2011. Web. . &lt;https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/19352_0511bp_lough.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural gas==
The main natural gas producers in Russia are gas companies [[Gazprom]], [[Novatek]], [[Itera]], [[Northgas]] and [[Rospan]], and vertically integrated oil and gas companies [[Surgutneftegaz]], [[TNK-BP]], [[Rosneft]] and [[LUKOIL]].&lt;ref name=alex1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/marketintelligence/rpi/russian-independent.htm |title=The Independent Gas Producers in Russia |publisher=Alexander's Gas &amp; Oil Connections |date=March 2006 |accessdate=2008-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222155751/http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/marketintelligence/rpi/russian-independent.htm |archivedate=22 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Majority state-owned Gazprom has a monopoly of natural gas pipelines and has the exclusive right to export natural gas, granted by the Federal Law "''On Gas Export''", which came into force on 20 July 2006.&lt;ref name=ft1&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f042c74a-fd59-11da-9b2d-0000779e2340.html | title=Duma votes for Russian gas export monopoly | publisher = [[Financial Times]] |author1=Neil Buckley |author2=Tobias Buck | date=2006-06-16 | accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gazprom also has control over all gas pipelines out of [[Central Asia]], and thus controls access to the [[Europe]]an market.&lt;ref name=ft2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/e4f52b20-8ad6-11db-8940-0000779e2340.html | title=Caspian boost for US policy | publisher = [[Financial Times]] | author=Isabel Gorst | date=2006-12-13 | accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia has used Central Asia's gas, primarily that from [[Turkmenistan]], on occasions where it has found itself unable to meet all its delivery obligations from its own production.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunden|first=Lars|last2=Fjaertoft|first2=Daniel|last3=Overland|first3=Indra|last4=Prachakova|first4=Alesia|date=2013-10-01|title=Gazprom vs. other Russian gas producers: The evolution of the Russian gas sector|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263093280|journal=Energy Policy|volume=61|pages=663–670|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.06.055}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2000 Gazprom allowing Turkmenistan to use its pipelines to supply gas to the Russian domestic market, to enable Gazprom to fulfil its obligations to European customers.&lt;ref name=iht1&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/12/news/energy.php | title=Russia takes heat over energy supply | publisher = [[International Herald Tribune]] | author=Judy Dempsey | date=2006-12-12 | accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Historically, the [[Medvezhye gas field|Medvezhye]], [[Urengoy gas field|Urengoy]] and [[Yamburg gas field]]s have made up the bulk of Gazprom's production.&lt;ref&gt;Söderbergh, B., Jakobsson, K., Aleklett, K., 2010. European energy security: an analysis of future Russian natural gas production and exports. Energy Policy 38 (12), 7827–7843.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in the coming 10–20 years an increasing share of Gazprom's production will have to come from new fields. Recent developments such as [[Yen-Yakhinskoe]], [[Yuzhno-Russkoye field|Yuzhno-Russkoye]] and [[West Pestsovoe]] in the [[Nadym-Pur-Taz]] area, which have all come on-stream since 2005, are relatively cost-efficient, being located close to the existing pipeline grid and other infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J., 2010. Non-Gazprom Gas Producers in Russia. Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; But they are not large enough to compensate for the decline in Gazprom's three core assets. Thus, the much larger [[Shtokman]] and [[Yamal Peninsula|Yamal]] developments will have to provide the bulk of new production capacity, by adding 70 and 200 BCM per year, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Gazprom, 2011b. Gazprom in Questions and Answers. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://eng.gazpromques&lt;/nowiki&gt; tions.ru/?id=7#c302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Investments in the development of Shtokman and Yamal are forecast to account for over 40% of Gazprom's total expected capital expenditure over the next 20 years. Although Shtokman has been shelved at least for the time being due to relatively low gas prices and high costs, the project may still be resuscitated during the coming decades, depending on developments in unconventional gas and the supply–demand picture. Meanwhile, work on the largest field on the [[Yamal Peninsula]], [[Bovanenkovo gas field|Bovanenkovo]], is forging ahead. In any case, the complexity of these projects drives high field development costs, which in turn require a high gas price to be profitable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Energy Strategy foresees non-Gazprom production rising from a share of 17% in 2008 to 25–30% by 2030, implying growth from 114 to about 245 BCM/year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The main export markets of Russian natural gas are the [[European Union]] and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. Russia supplies a quarter of the EU gas consumption, mainly via transit through [[Ukraine]] (Soyuz, Brotherhood) and [[Belarus]] ([[Yamal-Europe pipeline]]). The main importers are [[Germany]] (where links were developed as a result of Germany's ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' during the 1970s,&lt;ref name=opendemocracy&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-institutions_government/energy_policy_4186.jsp | title=Russia, Germany and European energy policy | publisher = openDemocracy.net | author=Dieter Helm | date=2006-12-12 | accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also Ukraine, [[Belarus]], [[Italy]], [[Turkey]], [[France]] and [[Hungary]].

In September 2009, [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] [[Vladimir Putin]] said Russia would try to liberalize the domestic gas market in the near future but would maintain Gazprom's export monopoly in the medium term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-338608.html Russia to maintain Gazprom export monopoly-PM Putin], [[UNIAN]] Retrieved on 2009-10-01&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil==
Energy was the backbone of the Soviet economy. The [[1973 oil embargo]] marked a turning point in Soviet society. The increase in the price of oil around the world prompted the USSR to begin exporting oil in exchange for money and Western technology. Increasing Western reliance on Russian resources further bolstered the importance of Russia’s energy sector to the overall economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actionforex.com/articles-library/financial-glossary/1973-oil-crisis-20041204320/ 4.	"Origins of the 1973 world oil shock." 1973 Oil Crisis. ], [[Action Forex]], 9 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Arctic ice cap]] shrinks due to [[global warming]], the prospect of oil exploration in the [[Arctic Ocean]] is thought to be an increasing possibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Aug2007-TheBattleforthenextenergyfrontier-ShamilYenikeyeff-and-TimothyFentonKrysiek.pdf The Battle for the Next Energy Frontier: The Russian Polar Expedition and the Future of Arctic Hydrocarbons], by Shamil Midkhatovich Yenikeyeff and Timothy Fenton Krysiek, [[Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]], August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 December 2001, Russia submitted documents to the [[UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] claiming expanded limits to [[Continental shelf of Russia|Russian continental shelf]] beyond the previous [[Exclusive Economic Zone|200 mile zone]] within the Russian Arctic sector.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;[https://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/submission_rus.htm Outer limits of the continental shelf beyond {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from the baselines: Submissions to the Commission: Submission by the Russian Federation] [[Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf|CLCS]]. [[United Nations]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the UN Commission recommended that Russia should carry out additional research,&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt; which commenced in 2007. It is thought that the area may contain 10bn tonnes of gas and [[oil]] deposits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,,2113289,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity ==

The Russian electricity market is dominated by [[Inter RAO]] and Gazprom Energoholding, the power generation subsidiary of [[Gazprom]]. While production and retail sale is open to competition, transmission and distribution remains under state control.

In recent years there have been several [[Power outage|blackouts]], notably the [[2005 Moscow power blackouts]].&lt;ref name=larsson&gt;Robert L. Larsson  [http://www2.foi.se/rapp/foir1934.pdf Russia's Energy Policy: Dimensions and Russia's Reliability as an Energy Supplier] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911134434/http://www2.foi.se/rapp/foir1934.pdf |date=11 September 2008 }}, FOI-R-- 1934 –SE, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change==
[[Vladimir Putin]] approved the [[Kyoto Protocol]] on 4 November 2004 and Russia officially notified the United Nations of its ratification on 18 November 2004. The issue of Russian ratification was particularly closely watched in the international community, as the accord was brought into force 90 days after Russian ratification (16 February 2005).

President Putin had earlier decided in favour of the protocol in September 2004, along with the Russian cabinet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mosnews.com/money/2004/09/30/kyotoapproved.shtml| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041011053455/http://www.mosnews.com/money/2004/09/30/kyotoapproved.shtml| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2004-10-11| title=Russian Government Approves Kyoto Protocol Ratification| work=mosnews.com| date=2004-09-30| accessdate=2006-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the opinion of the Russian Academy of Sciences, of the Ministry for Industry and Energy and of the then president's economic advisor, [[Andrey Illarionov]], and in exchange to EU's support for the Russia's admission in the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://english.pravda.ru/main/18/88/354/14495_kyoto.html | work=Pravda.com |title= Russia forced to ratify Kyoto Protocol to become WTO member| date=2004-10-26 | accessdate=2006-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As anticipated after this, ratification by the lower (22 October 2004) and upper house of parliament did not encounter any obstacles.

The Kyoto Protocol limits emissions to a percentage increase or decrease from their 1990 levels. Russia did not face mandatory cuts since its greenhouse-gas emissions fell well below the 1990 baseline due to a drop in economic output after the breakup of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/publication/13640/g8s_gradual_move_toward_postkyoto_climate_change_policy.html Tony Johnson, staff writer: Council on Foreign Relations]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, despite its growing economy, by 2012 Russia will by no means exceed the level of emissions in 1990, which is the Kyoto Protocol's year of departure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Russia_Kyoto_Protocol_And_Climate_Change_999.html Viktor Danilov-Danilyan for RIA Novosti Moscow (RIA Novosti) 21 February 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is debatable whether Russia will benefit from selling emissions credits to other countries in the Kyoto Protocol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sysecol.ethz.ch/Articles_Reports/Illarionov_Press_Conf.pdf | title=PRESS CONFERENCE WITH PRESIDENTIAL ECONOMIC ADVISER ANDREI ILLARIONOV | date=2003-10-03 | accessdate=2006-11-03 | format=PDF | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102101148/http://www.sysecol.ethz.ch/Articles_Reports/Illarionov_Press_Conf.pdf | archive-date=2 November 2006 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; although Gazprom has already entered the market.

==Energy usage==
In terms of the Russian energy demand structure, domestic production greatly exceeds domestic demand, making Russia the world’s leading net energy exporter.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The Federal Tariff Service sets gas and wholesale electricity prices, the Regional Energy Commissions set co-generated electricity and heating prices, and municipalities set prices for heat transmission and heat generation by municipal boilers. Heavily subsidised district heating—the distribution of heat from a central locale to subsidiary commercial or residential areas—plays a major role, providing over a third of energy requirements for industry and close to half those of the commercial and household sectors. Almost 50 percent of primary energy consumption in Russia is used for heat generation, transmission and distribution. Domestic gas prices generally are barely 15–20 percent of the market rate at which Russia’s gas is sold to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Dansie|last2=Marc|first2=Lanteigne|last3=Overland|first3=Indra|date=2010-02-01|title=Reducing Energy Subsidies in China, India and Russia: Dilemmas for Decision Makers|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41667826|journal=Sustainability|volume=2|doi=10.3390/su2020475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy in foreign policy==
{{See also|Russia in the European energy sector}}
Russia's [[energy superpower]] status became a hot topic in the [[European Union]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&amp;subID=822 Beware Russia, energy superpower] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903091235/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&amp;subID=822 |date=3 September 2007 }}, by Philip Delves Broughton, The First Post, 12 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's large reserves of natural gas have helped give it the title without much debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/events/index.cfm?fa=eventDetail&amp;id=860&amp;&amp;prog=zru How Sustainable is Russia's Future as an Energy Superpower?], by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 16 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia has identified natural gas as a key strategic asset, and since 20 July 2006 [[Gazprom]] has had the exclusive right to export natural gas. The Russian government is the largest shareholder of Gazprom, and has been accused of manipulating prices for political reasons, particularly in CIS nations.&lt;ref&gt;John Lough, "[https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/19352_0511bp_lough.pdf Russia's Energy Diplomacy]". Chatham House, 1 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Russia's annexation of Crimea and involvement in the War in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, Western countries imposed sanctions targeting the Russian oil and gas sector. The sanctions did not cause the Russian economy to collapse, but due to the long time-lag on the development of new oil and gas fields, could have a longer-term impact on Russian oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fjaertoft|first=Daniel|last2=Overland|first2=Indra|date=2015|title=Financial Sanctions Impact Russian Oil, Equipment Export Ban's Effects Limited|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281776234_Financial_Sanctions_Impact_Russian_Oil_Equipment_Export_Ban%27s_Effects_Limited|journal=Oil &amp; Gas Journal|volume=113(8)|pages=66-72|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Energy disputes===
Russia has been accused in the West (i.e. Europe and the [[United States]]) of using its natural resources as a policy tool to be wielded against offending states like [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], and other states it perceives as hindrances to its power. According to one estimate, since 1991 there have been more than 55 energy incidents, of which more than 30 had political underpinnings. Only 11 incidents had no political connections.&lt;ref name=larsson/&gt; On the other hand, Russian officials like to remind their Western partners that even at the height of the [[Cold War]] the Soviet Union never disrupted energy supplies to the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251718767&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia, in turn, accuses the West of applying double-standards relating to market principles, pointing out that it has been supplying gas to the states in question at prices that were significantly below world market levels, and in some cases remain so even after price hikes.  Russia argues that it is not obligated to effectively [[subsidy|subsidize]] the economies of post-Soviet states by supplying them with resources at below-market prices.

There is still a risk of supply interruptions for the states of the Former Soviet Union. Depending on bilateral relations and the present context, the risk for partial and/or short-duration cut-offs is high. Since 1991, the energy lever has been used for putting political or economic pressure on Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia that subsequently affected most of Europe. The number of incidents, i.e. cut-offs, take-overs, coercive price policy, blackmail or threats, is over fifty in total (of which about forty are cut-offs). Incidents appear to be equally divided between the Yeltsin and Putin eras, but the number of cut-offs has decreased by half during Putin. The immediate reasons for Russia’s coercive policy appear to be political concession in ongoing negotiations, infrastructure take-over, and execution of economically favorable deals or to make political statements. There are economic underpinnings in the majority of the cases and Russian demands for payments of debts are legitimate. However, there are also political underpinnings in more than half of the incidents, and in a few cases explicit political demands are evident.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Robert L..

====Azerbaijan and Armenia====
Starting 1 January 2007 Gazprom increased the price of natural gas to [[Azerbaijan]] from [[United States dollar|US$]]110 to $235 per thousand cubic metres. (At the time, Gazprom charged the EU US$250.) Azerbaijan refused to pay this price and the gas supply to Azerbaijan stopped. On its side, Azerbaijan stopped oil exports to and via Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Belarus====
{{Main article|Russia-Belarus energy dispute}}
The Russia-Belarus energy dispute began when [[Russia]]n [[state-owned]] [[natural gas|gas]] supplier [[Gazprom]] demanded an increase in gas prices paid by [[Belarus]], which has been closely allied with Moscow and forms a loose union state with Russia. It escalated on 8 January 2007, when the Russian state-owned pipeline company [[Transneft]] stopped pumping [[petroleum|oil]] into the [[Druzhba pipeline]] which runs through [[Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Czech Republic====
On 9 July 2008, after signing an agreement between the United States and the Czech Republic to host a tracking radar for an antiballistic missile system, the flow of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline to the Czech Republic started to reduce. Although officially the linkage between reduction of oil supplies and the radar agreement was not claimed, it was suspected.&lt;ref name=iht3&gt;

====Georgia====
{{See also|Georgian-Russian relations}}
In the January 2006 [[2006 North Ossetia sabotages|alleged North Ossetia sabotage]], two simultaneous explosions occurred on the main branch and a reserve branch of the Mozdok-Tbilisi pipeline in the Russian border region of [[North Ossetia]]. The electricity transmission line in Russia's southern region of Karachayevo-Cherkessiya near the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] border was brought down by an explosion just hours later. Georgian president [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] blamed Russia for putting pressure on Georgia's energy system at the time of the coldest weather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4637034.stm Russia blamed for 'gas sabotage'], by  BBC News, 22 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2006 Gazprom announced that it will construct a direct gas pipeline to Georgia's breakaway region of [[South Ossetia]]. The work on the pipeline started just before South Ossetia's 12 November referendum on separating from Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/2006-250-25.cfm Russia: Ossetia Pipeline Adds Fuel To The Georgia Fire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109204948/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/2006-250-25.cfm |date=9 January 2007 }}, by Nona Mchedlishvili, RFE/RL 6 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting 1 January 2007 Gazprom increased natural gas prices to Georgia following an international incident in an alleged effort to strongly influence the Georgian leadership's defiance of Moscow. The current price is 235 USD per thousand cubic meter, which is the highest among the CIS countries.

The August 2008 military conflict between Georgia and Russia over the autonomous region of South Ossetia, which has been de facto independent from Georgia since the early 1990s, is likely to shift the balance of power between the main players involved in the formation of the future of the Caspian and Central Asian energy sector, including:

• Producer and transit countries: Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Turkey and Iran;

• Foreign corporations operating in the region's hydrocarbon sector;

• Major external players: China, Russia, the European Union and the United States.

The volatility of these transit routes is likely to shape investment decisions of international oil companies involved in the development of Central Asian and Caspian hydrocarbons and their transportation to global markets. Governments of these resource-rich countries are bound to have serious concerns about the safety of BTC, WREP and BTE pipelines, the railway networks and the oil terminals at the Georgian Black Sea ports of Batumi, Kulevi and Poti, all of which were halted by the Georgian-Russian hostilities. Although, the pipelines were only temporarily shut down for security reasons and were not targeted or damaged in the conflict, their future expansion and the construction of related new pipeline projects, such as the Kazakh-Caspian Transportation System, the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline and Nabucco are now uncertain. In this situation, Central Asian and Caspian producers may opt for traditional exports via Russia (providing Moscow successfully expands the capacity of its oil and gas export routes) and the new export pipelines to China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/comment_0808-1.pdf The Georgia-Russia standoff and the future of Caspian and Central Asian energy supplies.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119143350/http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/comment_0808-1.pdf |date=19 November 2008 }}, by Shamil Midkhatovich Yenikeyeff, August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lithuania====
On 29 July 2006 Russia shut down oil export to [[Mažeikių Nafta|Mažeikių oil refinery]] in [[Lithuania]] after an oil spill on the Druzhba pipeline system occurred in Russia’s [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk oblast]], near the point where a line to Belarus and Lithuania branches off the main export pipeline. Transneft said it would need one year and nine months to repair the damaged section. Although Russia cited technical reasons for stopping oil deliveries to Lithuania, Lithuania claims that the oil supply was stopped because Lithuania sold the Mažeikių refinery to Polish company [[PKN Orlen]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=414&amp;issue_id=3822&amp;article_id=2371343 Russian oil supplies to Lithuania cut off] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121034522/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=414&amp;issue_id=3822&amp;article_id=2371343 |date=21 November 2006 }}, by Vladimis Socor, Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume 3, Issue 150 (3 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to avoid the refinery and infrastructure being bought out by Russian interests.&lt;ref name="FT-1"&gt;''[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/05ff71f8-7b60-11db-bf9b-0000779e2340.html Baltic lessons for EU in dealing with a resurgent Russia]'', Financial Times, (24 November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Russian crude oil is now being transshipped via the Būtingė Marine Terminal.

====Poland====
There has been rapprochement with Tusk's government in Warsaw, after two years of tensions with the conservative government of Kaczynski. The cooperation on the Yamal-Europe pipeline has continued without serious problems. Nevertheless, some disagreements concerning control of the Yamal-Europe pipeline and transit pricing remain. Despite attempts to relieve tensions, consecutive Polish governments strongly oppose the Nord Stream project bypassing Poland and favour further development of overland alternatives. It remains a contentious issue that as a result of the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute in 2009, Polish PGNIG gas company did not receive contracted supplies of Russian gas from Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;

====Ukraine====
{{Main article|Russia-Ukraine gas disputes}}
At the beginning of 2006 Russia greatly increased the price of gas for [[Ukraine]] to bring it in line with market values. The dispute between Russian state-owned gas supplier Gazprom and Ukraine over natural gas prices started in March 2005 (over the price of natural gas and prices for the transition of Gazprom's gas to Europe). The two parties were unable to reach an agreement to resolve the dispute, and Russia cut gas exports to Ukraine on 1 January 2006 at 10:00 MSK. The supply was restored on 4 January, when a preliminary agreement between two gas companies was settled. Other disputes arose in October 2007 and in January 2009, this dispute again resulted in 18 European countries reporting major falls or cut-offs of their gas supplies from Russia transported through Ukraine. Gas supplies restarted on 20 January 2009 and were fully restored on 21 January 2009.

===EU-Russia Energy Dialogue===
The EU-Russia Energy Dialogue was launched at the EU-Russia Summit in Paris in October 2000.  François Lamoureux, Director general for Energy and Transport at the European Commission and Viktor Khristenko, Vice-Prime Minister of the Russian Federation took up the responsibility as sole interlocutors.  Christian Cleutinx, then Head of Unit at the European Commission was designated as the Coordinator of the dialogue. At the working level the Energy Dialogue consists three thematic working groups. The Energy Dialogue involves the EU Member States, energy industry and the international financial institutions.&lt;ref name=euractiv&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/energy/eu-russia-energy-dialogue/article-150061 EU-Russia Energy Dialogue], by EurActiv.com, 12 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty===
{{See also|Energy Charter Treaty}}
Russia signed the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] in 1994, but flatly refused to ratify its current revision. Russia's main objections to the ratification revolve around the proviso about the third party access to the pipelines and transit fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/12/12/news/energy.php Russia gets tough on energy sales to Europe: No foreign access to pipelines, official says], by Judy Dempsey, [[International Herald Tribune]] 12 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encharter.org/index.php?id=21&amp;id_article=16&amp;L=0 Debating the Charter at the Energy Committee of the Russian State Duma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035134/http://www.encharter.org/index.php?id=21&amp;id_article=16&amp;L=0 |date=28 September 2007 }}. Press realise by the Energy Charter Conference Secretariat 7 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding the fact that Russia didn't ratify the treaty, [[Ivan Materov]], State Secretary and Deputy Minister of Industry and Energy of the Russian Federation, serves as the vice-chairman of the Energy Charter Conference, and [[Andrei Konoplyanik]] as the Deputy Secretary General.

Russia and the European Union have also failed to finalize the negotiations on the Energy Charter Protocol on Transit. The main issue remain open is how, and to what extent, the Protocol will include mechanisms for establishment long term transit arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encharter.org/index.php?id=37 Transit Protocol. Background to the Negotiations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210191510/http://www.encharter.org/index.php?id=37 |date=10 February 2012 }}. Background information by the Energy Charter Secretariat&lt;/ref&gt; Also the third party access to its pipeline infrastructure has remained Russia's main objection to the Protocol.

==Controversies==

===Corruption===
According to the estimation of Swedish economist [[Anders Åslund]] in 2008, 50% of the state-owned Gazprom's investments were lost through corrupt practices.&lt;ref name="divideanddominate"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/081024_smith_russiaeuroenergy_web.pdf | format = PDF | title=Russia and European Energy Security - Divide and Dominate | first =Keith C. | last = Smith | publisher = [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] | page = 11 |date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, the Russian section of Blue Stream pipeline was three times more expensive to construct per kilometer than the Turkish section of the pipeline.&lt;ref name="divideanddominate"/&gt;

Experts believe [[Bill Browder]]'s "visa problem" is related to that he made questions about Gazprom's murky intermediates which receive money from Gazprom.&lt;ref name="divideanddominate"/&gt;

===OPEC temporarily lowering the price of oil===
Crude oil prices have decline from over a 100 dollars a barrel in 2014 to below 50 US dollars in 2015.  Russia tried and failed to get OPEC support for production cutbacks and is now ramping up its oil production to reduce the drop in oil revenues.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-14&lt;/ref&gt;  OPEC's oil glut supply policy has affected the Russian economy&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2014/12/16/how-opec-destroyed-the-russian-ruble/&lt;/ref&gt;  and energy policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Saudi-Arabia-Leaving-The-US-Behind-For-Russia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palatul Episcopal Romano-Catolic 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Bishopric Palace of Oradea]]
The '''Episcopal palace''' ({{lang-ro|Palatul Episcopiei Romano-Catolice din Oradea}}) of the city of [[Oradea]] in [[Bihor county]], [[Romania]] dates to the Baroque times.

== History ==
It was founded in 1762 by the Baron Bishop Adam Patačić, as bishopric palace of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oradea Mare|Roman Catholic Diocese of Magnovaradimum]]. Illustrious Viennese architect Franz Anton Hillebrandt, designer of many Austrian palaces and one of Europe's 18th century best, designed the palace and planned the city's posh side as Baroque quarter, while engineer A.J. Neumann was in charge of the palace's massive construction, complete with its 365 exterior windows resembling the days of the year and 120 large, extravagant rooms distributed on three floor plans.

The architecture of the palace is of late Austrian Baroque style, a more sober and practical type compared to the overly ornamented [[French Baroque]], for example.  The building was meant to resemble on a smaller scale the famous Royal [[Belvedere (palace)]] of [[Vienna]], which likely was one of the reasons along with other religious conflicts that made Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] repudiate the founder, Adam Patachich, a [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatian]] nobleman and the [[bishop of Oradea]] between 1759 and 1776; he was then sent to another diocese, in [[Kalocsa]], [[Hungary]]. [[File:Adam Patačić (1717-1784).jpg|thumb|160px|Adam Patachich (Croatian: Patačić), the founder of the palace]] Nevertheless, the baron was a charismatic, highly educated humanist and an illuminated patron of arts, who is mostly remembered for the fine music and musicians he surrounded himself with: this is where Michael Haydn, famous composer and Joseph Haydn's brother, worked as a [[Kapellmeister]] in the bishop's orchestra. The bishop also employed at the court other famous European composers and violinists like [[Wenzel Pichl]] and [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf]], who between 1765-1769 served as a Musikdirektor.

Finally, in 1771, the Holy Roman Empress (jure uxori), Maria Theresa of Austria, together her son, future [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], arrived here to visit and make peace with a place whose project she did not initially fancy. In 1773 the palace unfortunately burned down entirely in a mysterious fire, but was reconstructed immediately by the next appointed bishop, after its original plans.

In the year 1855, a new side and entrance was added graciously in tone and respect with the initial building, with grand double stairways.  Later in time, after [[Romania]] gained possession of [[Transylvania]], it remained under the church's patronage but during the socialist regime, it was seized as state property.

On January 17, 1971, the Baroque Palace became a county museum hosting many large and fine archeological, historical, natural history, ethnographic and art collections under the name of "Muzeul Ţării Crişurilor" ("Museum of the Three Rivers Land"). The museum has approximately 400 000 pieces divided under four main collections: History and Archeology, Ethnography, Art and Natural History. Famous for its world-class Neolithic and Bronze Age collection, the museum also boasts treasures from Ancient Egypt and Greece. The ethnography section has probably the best of western Transylvanian folk exhibits anywhere, including a large selection of traditional costumes, peasant house appliances, pottery and painted Easter eggs.

The highlights of the Natural History section are the prehistoric animals including cave bears, giant elk, different mammoth types or dinosaurs (like Iguanodons, Valdosaurus or Camptosaurus). The interior courtyard is dotted by a long row of Romanian monarch busts added during the museum years.

The front courtyard is an artistic park with large old bronze and marble statues of historical figures and also home to a famous Baroque parish church erected in 1752 even before the palace, a work of the Italian architect Giovanni Battista Ricca modeled after the mother church of the [[Jesuits]], [[Church of the Gesu]] in Rome. The basilica contains the relics of King [[Saint Ladislaus]], born in year 1040, a splint of his skull being kept here in a gold box. In 1992, [[Pope John Paul II]] through the [[Holy See]]'s decree, raised the church to a holy basilica rank.

In 2003, like many other edifices, The Baroque Palace of Oradea was restored to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oradea Mare]] by the [[Government of Romania]], but the building is still being used as a museum until further negotiations are made.

'''Fiddleheads''' or '''fiddlehead greens''' are the furled [[frond]]s of a young [[fern]],&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern Fern. Encyclopedia of Earth. National council for Science and the Environment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109071540/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern |date=November 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; harvested for use as a [[vegetable]].

Left on the plant, each fiddlehead would unroll into a new [[frond]] ([[circinate vernation]]). As fiddleheads are harvested early in the season before the frond has opened and reached its full height, they are cut fairly close to the ground.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Fiddleheads have antioxidant activity, are a source of [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] and [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids, and are high in iron and fibre.&lt;ref name="Agriculture Canada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agr.gc.ca/cb/index_e.php?s1=tip-puce&amp;s2=2010&amp;page=05|title=Agriculture Canada Study|work=agr.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain varieties of fiddleheads have been shown to be [[carcinogenic]]. (See [[Bracken#Poisoning|bracken poisoning]])

The fiddlehead resembles the curled ornamentation (called a ''scroll'') on the end of a stringed instrument, such as a [[violin]]. It is also called a ''[[crozier]]'', after the curved staff used by [[bishop]]s, which has its origins in the shepherd's crook.

==Varieties==
The fiddleheads of certain ferns are eaten as a cooked [[leaf vegetable]]. The most popular of these are:

* [[Polystichum munitum|Western sword fern]], ''Polystichum munitum'', "king of northwest ferns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wou.edu/~baumgare/western_sword_fern.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316011141/http://www.wou.edu/~baumgare/western_sword_fern.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-03-16|title=WESTERN SWORD FERN (Polystichum munitum)|work=wou.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bracken]], ''Pteridium aquilinum'', found worldwide (Toxic if not cooked fully)
* [[Ostrich fern]], ''Matteuccia struthiopteris'', found in northern regions worldwide, and the central/eastern part of North America ''[[Fiddlehead fern#Health effects|(Health Warning)]]''
* [[Athyrium filix-femina|Lady fern]], ''Athyrium filix-femina'', throughout most of the temperate northern hemisphere.
* [[Cinnamon fern]] or buckhorn fern, ''Osmunda cinnamomea'', found in the eastern parts of [[North America]], although not so palatable as ostrich fern.
* [[Osmunda regalis|Royal fern]], ''Osmunda regalis'', found worldwide
* Midin, or ''[[Stenochlaena]] palustris'', found in [[Sarawak]], where it is prized as a local delicacy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Churchill|first1=Edward|title=Enjoy your midin without fear — Professor|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2018/04/06/enjoy-your-midin-without-fear-professor/|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=The Borneo Post|date=6 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406043655/http://www.theborneopost.com/2018/04/06/enjoy-your-midin-without-fear-professor/|archivedate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paul P.K.|first1=Chai|title=Midin (Stenochlaena palustris), the popular wild vegetable of Sarawak|journal=Agriculture Science Journal|date=April 2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=18-20|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180529135516if_/http://eprints.utar.edu.my/2006/1/Midin_(Stenochlaena_palustris),_the_popular_wild_vegetable_of_Sarawak.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Zenmai'' or [[flowering fern]], ''Osmunda japonica'', found in [[East Asia]]
* [[Vegetable fern]], ''Athyrium esculentum'', found throughout Asia and [[Oceania]]
Fiddleheads' ornamental value makes them very expensive in the temperate regions where they are not abundant.

==Sources and harvesting==
[[File:Fiddleheads Crosses de fougère.jpg|thumb|Bucket of newly collected fiddleheads]]

Available seasonally, fiddleheads are both foraged and commercially harvested in spring.&lt;ref name=TorStar/&gt;  When picking fiddleheads, it is recommended to take only half the tops per plant/cluster for sustainable harvest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://extension.umaine.edu/publications/2540e/ University of Maine, "Ostrich Fern Fiddleheads"]&lt;/ref&gt; Each plant produces several tops that turn into fronds; repeated over-picking will eventually kill the plant. Maintaining sustainable harvesting methods is important in the [[Plant propagation|propagation]] of any non-farmed food species. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Culinary uses==
[[File:Fiddlehead Fern as a vegetable.jpg|thumb|Fiddlehead fern as a vegetable]]

Fiddleheads have been part of traditional diets in much of [[Northern France]] since the beginning of the Middle Ages, across [[Asia]], and also  among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for centuries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} They are also part of the diet in the [[Russian Far East]] where they are often picked in the wild in autumn, preserved in salt over winter, and then consumed in spring.

===Asian cuisine===
In Indonesia, young fiddlehead ferns are cooked in a rich coconut sauce spiced with [[chili pepper]], [[galangal]], [[lemongrass]], [[turmeric]] leaves and other spices. This dish is called ''gulai pakis'' or ''gulai paku'', and originated from the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] ethnic group of [[Indonesia]]. In the [[Philippines]], fiddlehead fern or ''pakô'' is a delicacy often made into a salad with tomato, [[salted egg]] slices, and a simple vinaigrette dressing.

In East Asia, fiddleheads of bracken (''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'') are eaten as a vegetable, called ''warabi'' ({{lang|ja-Hani|蕨}}) in Japan, ''gosari'' ({{lang|ko|고사리}}) in Korea, and ''juécài'' ({{lang|zh|蕨菜}}) in China and Taiwan.  In Korea, a typical ''[[banchan]]'' (small side dish) is ''gosari-namul'' ({{lang|ko|고사리나물}}), which consists of prepared fernbrake fiddleheads that have been [[saute]]ed.  It is also a component of the popular dish ''[[bibimbap]]''. In [[Japan]], bracken fiddleheads are a prized dish, and roasting the fiddleheads is reputed to neutralize any toxins in the vegetable.

In Japan, fiddleheads of flowering fern (''[[Osmunda japonica]]''), known as ''zenmai'' ({{lang|ja-Hani|薇}}), as well as those of the ostrich fern (''[[Matteuccia struthiopteris]]''), known as ''kogomi'' ({{lang|ja-Kana|コゴミ}}), are commonly eaten in springtime. Fiddleheads in Japan are considered ''[[sansai]]'', or wild vegetables.

===Indian cuisine===
In the [[Indian subcontinent]], it is found in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] states of [[North India|North]] and [[Northeast India]].

In the [[Kullu#Kullu Valley|Kullu Valley]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], it is known locally as ''lingri'' and is famously used to make a pickle ''lingri ka achaar''. In the [[Kangra Valley]] it is called ''lungdu'' in the [[Kangri dialect]].In [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh|Chamba]] it is known as "Kasrod".

In [[Garhwal division]] of [[Uttarakhand]], it is called ''languda'' and eaten as a vegetable.

In [[Darjeeling]] and [[Sikkim]] regions, it is called ''niyuro'' (नियुरो) and is common as a vegetable side dish, often mixed with local cheese. It is also pickled.
In [[Assam]], it is known as ''dhekia xak'' ({{Lang-as|ঢেকীয়া শাক}}); there it is a popular side dish.
In the area of [[Jammu]] in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], it's known as ''kasrod'' (कसरोड). The most famous [[Dogra]] dish is ''kasrod ka achaar'' (fiddlehead fern pickle). It's also cooked as a dry vegetable side dish to be eaten with [[roti]]s or [[paratha]]s.

===Nepalese cuisine===
In [[Nepal]], it is a [[seasonal food]] called ''niyuro'' (नियुरो) and is served as a vegetable side dish, often cooked in local clarified butter. It is also pickled.

===North American cooking===
Ostrich ferns (''Matteuccia struthiopteris''), known locally as "fiddlehead ferns", grow wild in wet areas of northeastern North America in spring.  The [[Maliseet]], [[Mi'kmaq]], and [[Penobscot]] peoples of [[Eastern Canada]] and [[Maine]] have traditionally harvested fiddleheads, and the vegetable was introduced first to the [[Acadians|Acadian]] settlers in the early 18th century, and later to [[United Empire Loyalist]] colonists as they began settling in [[New Brunswick]] in the 1780s.&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Food Right Now and How to Cook It: Fiddleheads - A Brief History |url=http://www.gracelinks.org/2296/real-food-right-now-and-how-to-cook-it-fiddleheads |publisher=Grace Communications Foundation |accessdate=24 May 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6hkgihO5M?url=http://www.gracelinks.org/2296/real-food-right-now-and-how-to-cook-it-fiddleheads |archivedate=24 May 2016 |date=March 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Small"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Small|first1=Ernest|title=North American Cornucopia: Top 100 Indigenous Food Plants|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4665-8592-8|pages=308–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiddleheads remain a traditional dish in these regions, with most commercial harvesting occurring in New Brunswick, [[Quebec]] and Maine.&lt;ref name="TorStar"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Honey |first1=Kim |title=Attuned to fiddleheads |url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2008/05/21/attuned_to_fiddleheads.html |accessdate=24 May 2016 |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=21 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6hkizVgyA?url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2008/05/21/attuned_to_fiddleheads.html |archivedate=24 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiddleheads |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/fiddleheads/ |website=[[Canadian Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=24 May 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6hkinovs4?url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/fiddleheads/ |archivedate=24 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  North America's largest grower, packer and distributor of wild fiddleheads established [[Ontario]]'s first commercial fiddlehead farm in [[Port Colborne]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="TorStar"/&gt;  Fiddlehead-producing areas are also located in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt;  The Canadian village of [[Tide Head, New Brunswick]], bills itself as the "Fiddlehead Capital of the World."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walsh|first1=Victoria|last2=McCallum|first2=Scott|title=A Field Guide to Canadian Cocktails|date=2015|publisher=[[Random House of Canada]]|location=[[Toronto]]|isbn=978-0-449-01663-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiddleheads are sold fresh and frozen.  Fresh fiddleheads are available in the market for only a few weeks in springtime, and are fairly expensive. Pickled and frozen fiddleheads, however, can be found in some shops year-round. The vegetable is typically steamed, boiled and/or sautéed before being eaten hot, with [[hollandaise sauce]], butter, lemon, vinegar and/or garlic, or chilled in salad or with [[mayonnaise]].

To cook fiddleheads, it is advised&lt;ref name="health canada"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/eating-nutrition/safety-salubrite/fiddlehead-fougere-eng.php|title=Fiddlehead Safety Tips |publisher=Health Canada|date=2013-04-11|accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to remove the brown papery husk before washing in several changes of cold water, then boil or steam them. Boiling reduces the bitterness and the content of [[tannin]]s and toxins. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] associated a number of food-borne illness cases with fiddleheads in the early 1990s. Although they did not identify a toxin in the fiddleheads, the findings of that case suggest that fiddleheads should be cooked thoroughly before eating.&lt;ref name="health canada"/&gt; The cooking time recommended by health authorities is 15 minutes if boiled and 10 to 12 minutes if steamed.&lt;ref name="health canada"/&gt; The cooking method recommended by gourmets is to spread a thin layer in a steam basket and steam lightly, just until tender crisp.

==Health effects==
Fiddleheads contain various [[vitamin]]s and minerals, as well as [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] and [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids. They are a source of antioxidants and [[dietary fiber]].&lt;ref name="Agriculture Canada"/&gt; They are low in sodium, but rich in potassium, which may make them suitable for people who need a low-sodium diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bushway | first1 = A.

Fiddleheads may harbour microbes, and should be washed and cooked before eating.&lt;ref name="Agriculture Canada"/&gt;

Many ferns also contain the [[enzyme]] [[thiaminase]], which breaks down [[thiamine]]. This can lead to [[beriberi]], if consumed in extreme excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = W.

Further, there is some evidence that certain varieties of fiddleheads, e.g. bracken (''Pteridium genus''), are [[carcinogen]]ic. It is recommended to fully cook fiddleheads to destroy the [[shikimic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Carcinogenicity of bracken and shikimic acid. I. A. Evans and M. A.

'''Jovian Chronicles''' is a [[science fiction]] [[game]] setting published by [[Dream Pod 9]] since 1992. It introduces a complete universe for [[role-playing]] and [[wargaming]] space combat, featuring [[mecha]], giant [[spacecraft]] and epic space battles.

The setting was originally published as a pair of licensed supplements for the ''[[Mekton]]'' [[role-playing game]]; IANVS Games released the two volumes (''Jovian Chronicles'' and ''Europa Incident'') in 1992. This first edition is known amongst fans as the "Green Edition" because of the color scheme of its cover design.

The game was re-published as a full-fledged game line in 1997 by [[Dream Pod 9]], this time using their own in-house rule system. This edition, and all subsequent ones, are known as the "White Editions," though several of the supplemental books feature a dark blue starfield cover.

==Setting==
The game world shows one possible future, a time in which Mankind has expanded and settled the [[solar system]], going as far as [[terraforming]] [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. The colonists living around [[Jupiter]] are at odds with the government of [[Earth]], driving much of the series' intrigue. The game features a blend of action/adventure and hard-science space colonization facts. The books are based on plausible technical details to maintain a realistic [[hard science fiction]] setting.

*'''Mercury''': a small settlement, whose main exports are high quality electronics and [[metal]]s. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is the headquarters of the powerful Merchant Guild, an association of companies which provide most of the transportation throughout the system.
*'''Venus''': [[terraformed]] by a consortium of corporations, Venus is now a marginally [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet]]. The Venusian upper class and their workers live in polar [[arcologies]], surrounded by terraforming processors.
*'''Earth''': damaged by centuries of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and [[civil wars]], the motherworld is home to the Central Earth Government and Administration (CEGA), a [[bureaucratic]] planetary government that believes the [[Earth]] should lead the solar system.
*'''Orbital Colonies''': the salvation of many who fled [[Earth]], these are huge [[O'Neill Cylinder|O'Neill]] stations parked at the [[Lagrange points]]. Orbitals are peaceful people who follow CEGA's lead for protection. 
*'''United Solar Nations''': evolved from the old [[United Nations]] to provide a neutral arbiter between the various settlements. It has a private peace-keeping army, the USN Guard, and an interplanetary law enforcement agency, the Solar Police (SolaPol). 
*'''The Moon''': CEGA's industrial center, its inhabitants are living in huge complexes buried beneath the soil. Many of Earth's heavy industries were moved there long ago.
*'''Mars:''' a divided planet, home to the Martian Free Republic and the Martian Federation. Border clashes between the two are frequent.
*'''The Belt''': the [[asteroids]] are populated by mobile nomad communities, each a micro-society of its own. 
*'''Jupiter''': home to refugees from Earth. The enormous [[space stations]] of the Jovian Confederacy were the first to develop and field exo-armors. Thanks to the resources of the Jovian sub-system, the Confederacy is the richest nation in the solar system. 
*'''Titan''': the largest moon of [[Saturn]] is the farthest human settlement. It is the main source for complex [[hydrocarbon]] compounds and plays an important role in the industries of the solar system.

==Anime inspirations==
Many recent Western cartoon shows and games have Japanese anime styling. ''Jovian Chronicles'' also features anime-inspired artwork and narrative elements, though the various technical elements (ships, stations, equipment, etc.) are original works illustrated with computer art.

Exo-armors are one of the main hooks of the series, these one-crew [[mecha]] consist of big armored space suits talling 15 metres or more with weapons capable of devastating even small warships. The main source of inspiration for the game was the various iterations of the [[Gundam]] Universal Century series up to the early 90's, with strong influence from Gundam 0083 Stardust Memories and Gundam 0080 War in the Pocket. Hints of other influences such as [[Patlabor]] and to some extent, [[Macross]] and [[Mospeada]], are present, although no transformable mecha appear to date. ''Jovian Chronicles'' can be placed in the [[Real Robot]] anime genre.

The series art and mechanical designs were created by [[John Moscato]] and [[Ghislain Barbe]], the latter who was also responsible for the artistic style which characterized all of the Dream Pod 9's lines including ''[[Heavy Gear]]'' and ''[[Tribe 8]]''.

==Game rules==

The concept has its origins on a campaign played by the authors [[Mark A. Vezina]] and [[Etienne Gagnon]] since 1987, using [[R. Talsorian]]'s [[Mekton]] system. After 5 years of development, IANVS plublications licensed the Mekton II rules and published the ''Jovian Chronicles'' Campaign Setting, a 112-page letter sized book which describes the JC universe, timeline, technologies and introduces players to the setting thru a 12 episode campaign. The JC campaign works as an extension of the Mekton rules set, with minimum changes required and then only for character status and wealth, however, compared to other Mecha depicted in Mekton, JC Exo-armors tend to be less resilient and their weapons are less powerful. It is also of note that at this stage, ''Exos'' tend to be more balanced with little differences among them, while on later editions, ''grunt'' exos are intentionally inferior to ''hero'' machines, for example, a CEGA Syreen and a JC Pathfinder are equally balanced in power, armor and weapons, and similar in capabilities to larger machines.

Mecha designs also vary on this edition, being more complex and elaborated in design than on latter iterations, during this release, there were also a number of metal miniatures for six of the exo-armors in the setting, these were produced by Canadian manufacturer [[RAFM]] and were based on the campaign book technical designs by [[John Moscato]]. Miniatures were in 1/325 scale due to the fictional size of the exo-armors and presented one of the finest and most dynamic mecha sculptings of the era.

The second release of Jovian Chronicles, was the first one published by DP9, adapts the ''[[Silhouette game system]]'', a streamlined set of rules already tested and proved in ''[[Heavy Gear]]'', [[Dream Pod 9]]'s other successful [[science fiction]] game. It can be played as either a [[role-playing]] [[game]], a tactical [[Wargaming|wargame]], or an integration of both. There are major changes on this release, such as the aforementioned distinction among the different exo-armors and other equipment as well as the focus on the character creation.

Both the RPG and miniature games are built on the same basic rule mechanics. ''Silhouette'' which defines characters in terms of 10 base attributes (agility, knowledge, etc.), 5 derived attributes (health, etc.), and a variety of skills. Skill rolls make up the backbone of the system, which focuses on effect-based speed of play over grainy detail. The core mechanic involves rolling a number of 6-sided dice, taking the highest result, adding in modifiers for attributes and/or situation, and then comparing it to a set threshold number. If the result is higher than the threshold the test is a success; if it is lower the test is a failure. The margin by which the test succeeded (Margin of Success, MoS) or failed (Margin of Failure, MoF) helps to determine the final outcome. Combat is handled by the same system, with characters taking penalty-inflicting wounds rather than depleting a set number of health points. As a result, the system can be lethal, especially on inexperienced characters.

New miniatures were also released for this edition, for both, exo-armor/fighters as well as spaceships. The new line of miniatures covered a much broader range of subjects, at the expense of size, being scaled at 1/500 for the exo armor/fighters which were near half the size of the original ones, this edition also marks the appearance of spaceship miniatures, which were scaled to 1/5000.

During this stage, the game system was splintered into the ''Silhouette Core'' RPG rules and the ''Lightning Strike'' system for tactical scenarios. The latter, is a more abstract version of the original tactical system which allow for combined arms maneuvers.

A third edition [[Jovian Wars]] was put on kickstarter during March-April 2017 and is in the process of delivering to its backers, the new edition is a fleet scale tactical game, whose rules are distributed for free at the DP9 website and changes (again) the scale of the miniatures to 1/1000 to exo-armors and fighters and 1/4000 for the spaceships.

This change in scale intends to represent more realistically the magnitude of the conflicts depicted, making combat units smaller and warships larger. It features a new turning template for ship maneuvers which is promoted as the major innovation in the system and due to the scale of the exo-armors, they now operate in squadrons of 3 miniatures each. With the new scale, each exo/fighter is around 15mm in height, compared to 30mm for Lightning strike minis and an average of 54mm for RAFM miniatures. The RPG aspect of the game is all but left aside.

The project was funded, however it is uncertain if besides backers, other potential or new players will accept the scale change which has turned the exo-armors, an emblematic symbol of the series and marketing hook (first edition depicted a full page illustration of a Jovian Exo-armor on cover which was also used on the RAFM blister's card) into a sort of battle counter (size matters... sometime), rather focusing on ship to ship maneuvers.

The '''Kanguk Formation''' is a geological [[Formation (geology)|formation]] in the [[Northwest Territories]] of [[Canada]] whose strata date back to the [[Late Cretaceous]]. Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation.&lt;ref name="cretaceousdistribution"&gt;Weishampel, David B; et al. (2004). "Dinosaur distribution (Late Cretaceous, North America)." In: Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osmólska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 574-588. {{ISBN|0-520-24209-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first described in the Kanguk Peninsula of the [[Axel Heiberg Island]], along the shore of the Stand Fiord by Souther in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geological Survey of Canada]] Map 36-1959&lt;/ref&gt; The formation occurs throughout the Sverdrup Basin and the southern [[Queen Elizabeth Islands]].

==Lithology==
The Kanguk Formation is composed of dark [[shale]] and [[siltstone]] with interbeds of [[sandstone]], [[bentonite]] and [[tuff]].&lt;ref name=lexicon/&gt; Thicker sandstone and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] beds occur in the western reaches in [[Eglinton Island]].

When installed, the tube projects through holes in the center of the cavity resonators, with the sides of the cavities making contact with the metal rings on the tube.]]

A '''klystron''' is a specialized linear-beam [[vacuum tube]], invented in 1937 by American electrical engineers [[Russell and Sigurd Varian]],&lt;ref name=tubeguys&gt;Pond, Norman H. "The Tube Guys". Russ Cochran, 2008 p.31-40&lt;/ref&gt; which is used as an [[amplifier]] for high [[radio frequencies]], from [[Ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] up into the [[microwave]] range. Low-power klystrons are used as oscillators in terrestrial [[microwave relay]] communications links, while high-power klystrons are used as output tubes in [[Ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] [[television transmitter]]s, [[satellite communication]], [[radar]] [[transmitter]]s, and to generate the drive power for modern [[particle accelerator]]s.

In a klystron, an [[electron beam]] interacts with radio waves as it passes through [[cavity resonator|resonant cavities]], metal boxes along the length of a tube.&lt;ref name="Gilmour"&gt;{{cite book

The energy of the electron beam amplifies the signal, and the amplified signal is taken from a cavity at the other end of the tube.  The output signal can be coupled back into the input cavity to make an [[electronic oscillator]] to generate radio waves.  The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of klystrons can be high, 60&amp;nbsp;dB (one million) or more, with output power up to tens of [[megawatt]]s, but the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] is narrow, usually a few percent although it can be up to 10% in some devices.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;

A ''reflex klystron'' is an obsolete type in which the [[electron beam]] was reflected back along its path by a high potential electrode, used as an oscillator.

The name  ''klystron'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb κλύζω (''klyzo'') referring to the action of waves breaking against a shore, and the suffix -τρον ("tron") meaning the place where the action happens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Varian |first1=R. H. |last2=Varian |first2=S. F. |year=1939 |title=A High Frequency Oscillator and Amplifier |journal=[[Journal of Applied Physics]] |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=321 |bibcode = 1939JAP....10..321V |doi=10.1063/1.1707311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "klystron" was suggested by [[Hermann Fränkel]], a professor in the classics department at Stanford University when the klystron was under development.&lt;ref&gt;Varian, Dorothy. "The Inventor and the Pilot". Pacific Books, 1983 p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Prototype klystron cutaway.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The first prototype klystron, manufactured by Westinghouse in 1940. Part of the tube is cut away to show the internal construction.  On the left are the cathode and accelerating anode, which create the electron beam. In the center between the wooden supports is the drift tube, surrounded by the two donut-shaped cavity resonators, the "buncher" and the "catcher". The output terminal is visible at top. On the right is the cone shaped collector anode, which absorbs the electrons.  It could generate 200&amp;nbsp;W of power at 40&amp;nbsp;centimeters (750&amp;nbsp;MHz) with 50% efficiency.]]

The klystron was the first significantly powerful source of radio waves in the [[microwave]] range; before its invention the only sources were the [[Barkhausen-Kurz tube]] and [[Magnetron|split anode magnetron]], which were limited to very low power. It was invented by the brothers [[Russell and Sigurd Varian]] at [[Stanford University]]. Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Varian, Dorothy. "The Inventor and the Pilot". Pacific Books, 1983 p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon publication in 1939,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of US and UK researchers working on [[radar]] equipment. The Varians went on to found [[Varian Associates]] to commercialize the technology (for example, to make small [[linear accelerators]] to generate photons for external beam [[radiation therapy]]). Their work was preceded by the description of velocity modulation by A. Arsenjewa-Heil and [[Oskar Heil]] (wife and husband) in 1935, though the Varians were probably unaware of the Heils' work.&lt;ref name=Heil&gt;{{cite journal | journal = American Physics Society: Division of Plasma Physics Conference, Pittsburg, PA | title = Invited paper: The Klystron: A microwave source of surprising range and endurance | author = George Caryotakis | publisher = Stanford, CA: Stanford SLAC | date = November 18, 1997 |url = http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-7731.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of physicist [[W.W. Hansen]] was instrumental in the development of the klystron and was cited by the Varian brothers in their 1939 paper.  His resonator analysis, which dealt with the problem of accelerating electrons toward a target, could be used just as well to decelerate electrons (i.e., transfer their kinetic energy to RF energy in a resonator).  During the [[World War II|second World War]], Hansen lectured at the MIT Radiation labs two days a week, commuting to Boston from [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]] on Long Island.  His resonator was called a "rhumbatron" by the Varian brothers.&lt;ref name=tubeguys /&gt;  Hansen died of [[beryllium disease]] in 1949 as a result of exposure to [[beryllium oxide]] (BeO).

During the [[Second World War]], the Axis powers relied mostly on (then low-powered and long wavelength) klystron technology for their radar system microwave generation, while the Allies used the far more powerful but frequency-drifting technology of the [[cavity magnetron]] for much shorter-wavelength one centimeter microwave generation. Klystron tube technologies for very high-power applications, such as [[synchrotron]]s and radar systems, have since been developed.

Right after the war, [[American Telephone and Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] used 4 watt klystrons in its brand new network of [[microwave relay]] links that covered the US continent.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald W Brock , "The Second Information Revolution", Harvard University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0674028791}}, pp. 122,123&lt;/ref&gt;  The network provided long distance telephone service and also carried television signals for the major TV networks. [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]] also built point-to-point microwave communication links using intermediate repeater stations at about 40 mile intervals at that time, using 2K25 reflex klystrons in both the transmitters and receivers.

== Operation ==
Klystrons amplify RF signals by converting the kinetic energy in a DC electron beam into radio frequency power. In a vacuum, a beam of electrons is emitted by a [[Hot cathode|thermionic cathode]] (a heated pellet of low [[work function]] material), and accelerated by high-voltage electrodes (typically in the tens of kilovolts). 

This beam passes through an input [[cavity resonator]].  RF energy has been fed into the input cavity at, or near, its [[resonant frequency]], creating [[standing wave]]s, which produce an oscillating voltage, which acts on the electron beam. The electric field causes the electrons to "bunch": electrons that pass through when the electric field opposes their motion are slowed, while electrons which pass through when the electric field is in the same direction are accelerated,  causing the previously continuous electron beam to form bunches at the input frequency.  

To reinforce the bunching, a klystron may contain additional "buncher" cavities.  

The beam then passes through a "drift" tube, in which the faster electrons catch up to the slower ones, creating the "bunches", then through a "catcher" cavity.  

In the output "catcher" cavity, each bunch enters the cavity at the time in the cycle when the electric field opposes the electrons' motion, decelerating them.  Thus the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted to potential energy of the field, increasing the amplitude of the oscillations. The oscillations excited in the catcher cavity are coupled out through a [[coaxial cable]] or [[waveguide]].  

The spent electron beam, with reduced energy, is captured by a collector electrode.

To make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]], the output cavity can be coupled to the input cavity(s) with a [[coaxial cable]] or [[waveguide]]. [[Positive feedback]] excites spontaneous oscillations at the resonant frequency of the cavities.

==Two-cavity klystron==
[[Image:Klystron.enp.gif|right]]
The simplest klystron tube is the two-cavity klystron.  In this tube there are two microwave cavity resonators, the "catcher" and the "buncher".  When used as an amplifier, the weak microwave signal to be amplified is applied to the buncher cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide, and the amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity.

At one end of the tube is the [[hot cathode]] which produces electrons when heated by a filament.  The electrons are attracted to and pass through an [[anode]] cylinder at a high positive potential; the cathode and anode act as an [[electron gun]] to produce a high velocity stream of electrons.  An external [[electromagnet]] winding creates a longitudinal [[magnetic field]] along the beam axis which prevents the beam from spreading.

The beam first passes through the "buncher" cavity resonator, through grids attached to each side.  The buncher grids have an oscillating AC potential across them, produced by standing wave oscillations within the cavity, excited by the input signal at the cavity's [[resonant frequency]] applied by a coaxial cable or waveguide.  The direction of the field between the grids changes twice per cycle of the input signal.  Electrons entering when the entrance grid is negative and the exit grid is positive encounter an electric field in the same direction as their motion, and are accelerated by the field.  Electrons entering a half-cycle later, when the polarity is opposite, encounter an electric field which opposes their motion, and are decelerated.

Beyond the buncher grids is a space called the ''drift space''.  This space is long enough so that the accelerated electrons catch up with electrons that were accelerated at an earlier time, forming "bunches" longitudinally along the beam axis.  Its length is chosen to allow maximum bunching at the resonant frequency, and may be several feet long.

[[File:Klystron oscillator 1944.jpg|thumb|Klystron oscillator from 1944. The electron gun is on the right, the collector on the left.  The two [[cavity resonator]]s are in center, linked by a short coaxial cable to provide positive feedback.]]

The electrons then pass through a second cavity, called the "catcher", through a similar pair of grids on each side of the cavity.  The function of the ''catcher grids'' is to absorb energy from the electron beam.  The bunches of electrons passing through excite standing waves in the cavity, which has the same resonant frequency as the buncher cavity.  Each bunch of electrons passes between the grids at a point in the cycle when the exit grid is negative with respect to the entrance grid, so the electric field in the cavity between the grids opposes the electrons motion.  The electrons thus do work on the electric field, and are decelerated, their [[kinetic energy]] is converted to electric [[potential energy]], increasing the amplitude of the oscillating electric field in the cavity.  Thus the oscillating field in the catcher cavity is an amplified copy of the signal applied to the buncher cavity.  The amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide.

After passing through the catcher and giving up its energy, the lower energy electron beam is absorbed by a "collector" electrode, a second anode which is kept at a small positive voltage.

===Klystron oscillator===
An [[electronic oscillator]] can be made from a klystron tube, by providing a [[feedback]] path from output to input by connecting the "catcher" and "buncher" cavities with a [[coaxial cable]] or [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]].  When the device is turned on, [[electronic noise]] in the cavity is amplified by the tube and fed back from the output catcher to the buncher cavity to be amplified again.  Because of the high [[Q factor|Q]] of the cavities, the signal quickly becomes a sine wave at the [[resonant frequency]] of the cavities.

==Multicavity klystron==
In all modern klystrons, the number of cavities exceeds two.  Additional "buncher" cavities added between the first "buncher" and the "catcher" may be used to increase the gain of the klystron, or to increase the bandwidth.

The residual kinetic energy in the electron beam when it hits the collector electrode represents wasted energy, which is dissipated as heat, which must be removed by a cooling system.  Some modern klystrons include depressed collectors, which recover energy from the beam before collecting the electrons, increasing efficiency.  Multistage depressed collectors enhance the energy recovery by "sorting" the electrons in energy bins.

==Reflex klystron==
[[Image:ExKlystron.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Low-power Russian reflex klystron from 1963.  The [[cavity resonator]] from which the output is taken, is attached to the electrodes labeled ''Externer Resonator''.  Reflex klystrons are almost obsolete now.]]

{{main|Sutton tube}}

The [[reflex klystron]] (also known as a [[Sutton tube]] after one of its inventors, Robert Sutton) was a low power klystron tube with a single cavity, which functioned as an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]].  It was used as a [[local oscillator]] in some radar receivers and a [[modulator]] in microwave transmitters the 1950s and 60s, but is now obsolete, replaced by semiconductor microwave devices.

In the reflex klystron the electron beam passes through a single resonant cavity. The electrons are fired into one end of the tube by an [[electron gun]]. After passing through the resonant cavity they are reflected by a negatively charged reflector electrode for another pass through the cavity, where they are then collected.  The electron beam is velocity modulated when it first passes through the cavity. The formation of electron bunches takes place in the drift space between the reflector and the cavity. The [[volt]]age on the reflector must be adjusted so that the bunching is at a maximum as the electron beam re-enters the resonant cavity, thus ensuring a maximum of energy is transferred from the electron beam to the [[Radio frequency|RF]] oscillations in the cavity. The reflector voltage may be varied slightly from the optimum value, which results in some loss of output power, but also in a variation in frequency. This effect is used to good advantage for automatic frequency control in receivers, and in [[frequency modulation]] for transmitters. The level of modulation applied for transmission is small enough that the power output essentially remains constant. At regions far from the optimum voltage, no oscillations are obtained at all.

There are often several regions of reflector voltage where the reflex klystron will oscillate; these are referred to as modes. The electronic tuning range of the reflex klystron is usually referred to as the variation in frequency between half power points&amp;mdash;the points in the oscillating mode where the power output is half the maximum output in the mode.

Modern [[semiconductor]] technology has effectively replaced the reflex klystron in most applications.

== Tuning ==
[[Image:Aust.-Synchrotron,-Klystron-for-Storage-Ring,-14.06.2007.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Large klystrons as used in the [[storage ring]] of the [[Australian Synchrotron]] to maintain the energy of the [[electron]] beam]]

Some klystrons have cavities that are tunable.  By adjusting the frequency of individual cavities, the technician can change the operating frequency, gain, output power, or bandwidth of the amplifier. No two klystrons are exactly identical (even when comparing like part/model number klystrons). Each unit has manufacturer-supplied calibration values for its specific performance characteristics. Without this information the klystron would not be properly tunable, and hence not perform well, if at all.

Tuning a klystron is delicate work which, if not done properly, can cause damage to equipment or injury to the technician due to the very high voltages that could be produced. The technician must be careful not to exceed the limits of the graduations, or damage to the klystron can result. Other precautions taken when tuning a klystron include using nonferrous tools. Some klystrons employ permanent [[magnets]].  If a technician uses [[ferrous]] tools (which are [[ferromagnetic]]) and comes too close to the intense magnetic fields that contain the electron beam, such a tool can be pulled into the unit by the intense magnetic force, smashing fingers, injuring the technician, or damaging the unit. Special lightweight nonmagnetic (or rather very weakly [[diamagnetic]]) tools made of [[beryllium]] alloy have been used for tuning U.S. Air Force klystrons.

Precautions are routinely taken when transporting klystron devices in aircraft, as the intense magnetic field can interfere with magnetic navigation equipment. Special overpacks are designed to help limit this field "in the field," and thus allow such devices to be transported safely.

==Optical klystron==
The technique of amplification used in the klystron is also being applied experimentally at optical frequencies in a type of [[laser]] called the [[free-electron laser]] (FEL); these devices are called ''optical klystrons''.&lt;ref name="Bonifacio"&gt;{{cite journal

The electron beam passes through an undulator, in which a laser light beam causes bunching of the electrons.  Then the beam passes through a second undulator, in which the electron bunches cause oscillation to create a second, more powerful light beam.&lt;ref name="Bonifacio" /&gt;

==Floating drift tube klystron==
The floating drift tube klystron has a single cylindrical chamber containing an electrically isolated central tube. Electrically, this is similar to the two cavity oscillator klystron with a lot of feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the drift tube and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator klystron has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is electrically insulated from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.

==Applications==
Klystrons can produce far higher microwave power outputs than [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] microwave devices such as [[Gunn diode]]s.  In modern systems, they are used from UHF (hundreds of megahertz) up to hundreds of gigahertz (as in the Extended Interaction Klystrons in the [[CloudSat]] satellite). Klystrons can be found at work in [[radar]], satellite and wideband high-power communication (very common in [[television]] [[broadcasting]] and EHF [[satellite]] terminals), medicine ([[radiation oncology]]), and [[high-energy physics]] ([[particle accelerator]]s and experimental reactors). At [[SLAC]], for example, klystrons are routinely employed which have outputs in the range of 50&amp;nbsp;MW (pulse) and 50&amp;nbsp;kW (time-averaged) at 2856&amp;nbsp;MHz. The [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo Planetary Radar]] uses two klystrons that provide a total power output of 1&amp;nbsp;MW (continuous) at 2380&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=D.

A '''liquid resistor''' is an electrical [[resistor]] in which the resistive element is a liquid. Fixed-value liquid resistors are typically used where very high power dissipation is required. They are used in the rotor circuits of large [[slip ring]] [[induction motor]]s  to control starting current, torque and to limit large electrical fault currents (while other protection systems operate to clear or isolate the fault). They typically have [[electrode]]s made of welded steel plate ([[galvanised]] to reduce corrosion), suspended by insulated connections in a conductive chemical solution held in a tank - which may be open or enclosed. The tank body is normally solidly [[ground (electricity)|grounded or earthed]]. A typical unit can be rated for continuous use, or for short periods when used for current limitation in protection systems.

==Liquid neutral earthing resistor==
[[File:33kV liquid earthing resistor.jpg|thumb|right|Liquid earthing resistor, 33kV 21 ohms, rated for 750 amps for 10 seconds, providing an earth path for the tertiary winding of a 275/132/33kV autotransformer.]]
A common use in the electrical power generating and distribution industry is as a fault current limiter in the common neutral leg of large three-phase transformers and generators. In the UK they are known as Liquid Neutral Earthing Resistors (LNERs).

A rating of 0.5 megawatt for 30 seconds would not be unusual to protect the winding of a 660 MW generator. In this application where a neutral leg current flows due to a current imbalance between the generator or transformer windings due to a fault, it is limited in magnitude by the resistor.

A permanently installed [[current transformer]] (CT) fixed around the neutral leg feeder to the LNER senses the current. The CT sends a signal current to an external sensing circuit (the protection system) which then sends a signal to the relevant circuit breaker to open and disconnect the supply or isolate the generator (or transformer) from the fault.The ohmic value of the resistor is calculated as a function of the permissible fault current and the system voltage to earth.&lt;ref name="1st"&gt;A.C. Franklin, D.P.Franklin et al (1983) The J&amp;P Transformer Book 11th ed.P484: Butterworth &amp; Co Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electrolyte in power industry LNERs==

The [[electrolyte]] is normally a custom solution of [[sodium carbonate]] (soda ash) mixed on-site for the specific job.

This salt is [[alkaline]] and electrode corrosion effects on [[galvanised steel]] tanks is manageable if re-galvanisation is possible.

The resistance of the bulk electrolyte is a function of temperature and the concentration of the salt&lt;ref name="2nd"&gt;G.R. Jones, M.A. Laughton, M.G. Say (1993) Electrical Engineer's Reference Book / edited P2/7: Reed Educational and Professional Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7506-1202-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; governed by the formula:

:''R''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|1 + 0.03''θ''}}

where ''θ'' is the temperature (in Celsius) and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the standardised or datum calibration temperature.

A specialised technique is required to accurately calibrate an LNER electrolyte bulk resistance value and it is normally carried out by experienced power engineers and technicians. This task must be done off-load at routine intervals (roughly 2–4 years depending on results from routine monitoring) to maintain the resistance value within tolerance and facilitate inspection of the LNER.

==Notes==
There is no consensus at all on species limits in ''Betula'', with different authors differing wildly in what species they accept, from under 30 species, to over 60. The above (incomplete) list was compiled from the references cited below. Birches will hybridise very freely, particularly in cultivation but also in the wild where conditions and species present permit. While differing [[chromosome]] number ([[diploid]], [[Ploidy|tetraploid]], etc.) may reduce interbreeding, it is not an absolute bar to it. Many botanists regard differing chromosome number as a specific discriminant, though not all do so (e.g. some include ''B. cordifolia'' and ''B. neoalaskana'' as varieties within ''B. papyrifera'').

&lt;!-- Current distances (first table) --&gt;
There are 52 [[stellar systems]] beyond our own [[Solar system]] that currently lie within {{convert|5.0|pc|ly|abbr=off|sigfig=3}} of the [[Sun]]. These systems contain a total of 63 [[star]]s, of which 50 are [[red dwarf]]s, by far the most common type of star in the [[Milky Way]]. Much more massive stars, such as our own, make up the remaining 13. In addition to these "true" stars, there are 11 [[brown dwarf]]s (objects not quite massive enough to [[Hydrogen fusion|fuse hydrogen]]), and 4 [[white dwarf]]s (extremely dense objects that remain after stars such as our Sun exhaust all fusable hydrogen in their core and slowly shed their outer layers while only the collapsed core remains). Despite the relative proximity of these objects to Earth, only nine (not including the Sun) are brighter than 6.5 [[apparent magnitude]], the dimmest magnitude visible to the [[naked eye]] from Earth.&lt;ref name="Weaver1947"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;!-- Past/Future distances (second table) --&gt;
Based on results from the [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia telescope]]'s second data release from April 2018, an estimated 694 stars will possibly approach the Solar system to less than {{convert|5.0|pc|ly|abbr=off|sigfig=2}} over the next 15 million years. Of these, 26 have a good probability to come within {{convert|1.0|pc|ly|abbr=off|sigfig=2}} and another 7 within {{convert|0.5|pc|ly|abbr=off|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name="Bailer2018"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bailer-Jones|first1=C.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number is likely much higher, due to the sheer number of stars needed to be surveyed; a star approaching the Solar System 10 million years ago, moving at a typical Sun-relative 20–200 kilometers per second, would be 600–6,000 light years from the Sun at present day, with millions of stars closer to the Sun. The closest encounter to the Sun so far predicted is the low-mass orange dwarf star [[Gliese 710]] / HIP 89825 with roughly 60% the mass of the Sun.&lt;ref name="Hall2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=Known Close Stellar Encounters Surge in Number

&lt;!-- Notes on methodology --&gt;
The easiest way to determine stellar distance to the Sun for objects at these distances is [[parallax]], which measures how much stars appear to move against background objects over the course of Earth's orbit around the Sun. As a [[parsec]] (parallax-second) is defined by the distance of an object that would appear to move exactly one [[Minute and second of arc|second of arc]] against background objects, stars less than 5 parsecs away will have measured parallaxes of over 0.2 arcseconds, or 200 milliarcseconds. Determining past and future positions relies on accurate [[Astrometry|astrometric]] measurements of their parallax and [[proper motions|total proper motion]]s (how far they move across the sky due to their actual velocity relative to the Sun), along with [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopically]] determined [[radial velocity|radial velocities]] (their speed directly towards or away from us, which combined with proper motion defines their true movement through the sky relative to the Sun). Both of these measurements are subject to increasing and significant errors over very long time spans, especially over the several thousand-year time spans it takes for stars to noticeably move relative to each other.&lt;ref name="Matthews1994"&gt;{{cite journal

The [[spectral classification|class]]es of the stars and brown dwarfs are shown in the color of their spectral types (these colors are derived from conventional names for the spectral types and do not represent the star's observed color). Many brown dwarfs are not listed by [[visible spectrum|visual magnitude]] but are listed by near-infrared [[J band (infrared)|J band]] [[Magnitude (astronomy)|apparent magnitude]] due to how dim (and often invisible) they are in visible colors.

==Distant future and past encounters==

Over long periods of time, the slow independent motion of stars change in both relative position and in their distance from the observer. This can cause other currently distant stars to fall within a stated range, which may be readily calculated and predicted using accurate [[Astrometry|astrometric]] measurements of [[parallax]] and [[proper motions|total proper motion]]s, along with [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopically]] determined [[radial velocity|radial velocities]]. Although predictions can be extrapolated back into the past or forward into the future, they are subject to increasing significant cumulative errors over very long periods.&lt;ref name="Matthews1994" /&gt; Inaccuracies of these measured parameters make determining the true minimum distances of any encountering stars or brown dwarfs fairly difficult.&lt;ref&gt;See also: [[Stellar kinematics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first stars known to approach the Sun particularly close is [[Gliese 710]]. The star, whose mass is roughly half that of the Sun, is currently 62 light-years from the Solar System. It was first noticed in 1999 using data from the [[Hipparcos]] satellite, and was estimated to pass less than {{Convert|1.3|ly|pc}} from the Sun in 1.4 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=García-Sánchez |first1=Joan |last2=Preston |first2=Robert A. |last3=Jones |first3=Dayton L. |last4=Weissman |first4=Paul R. |last5=Lestrade |first5=Jean-François |last6=Latham |first6=David W. |last7=Stefanik |first7=Robert P. |title=Stellar Encounters with the Oort Cloud Based on [ITAL]Hipparcos[/ITAL] Data |journal=The Astronomical Journal |date=February 1999 |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=1042–1055 |doi=10.1086/300723 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the release of [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]]'s observations of the star, it has since been refined to a much closer {{convert|0.178|ly|pc}}, close enough to significantly disturb objects in the [[Oort cloud]], which extends out to {{convert|1.2|ly|pc}} from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bailer-Jones |first1=C. A. L. |last2=Rybizki |first2=J. |last3=Andrae |first3=R. |last4=Fouesneau |first4=M. |title=New stellar encounters discovered in the second                           data release |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |date=13 August 2018 |volume=616 |pages=A37 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201833456 |arxiv=1805.07581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second closest object known to approach the Sun was only discovered in 2018 after Gaia's second data release, known as 2MASS J0610-4246. Its approach has not been fully described due to it being a distant binary star with a red dwarf, but almost certainly passed less than 1 light year from the Solar System roughly 1.16 million years ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5893">'''MCACEA''' ('''Multiple Coordinated Agents Coevolution Evolutionary Algorithm''') is a general framework that uses a single [[evolutionary algorithm]] (EA) per agent sharing their optimal solutions to coordinate the evolutions of the EAs populations using cooperation objectives. This framework can be used to optimize some characteristics of multiple cooperating agents in [[mathematical optimization]] problems. More specifically, due to its nature in which both individual and cooperation objectives are optimize, MCACEA is used in [[multi-objective optimization]] problems.

==Description and implementation==
MCACEA, uses multiple EAs (one per each agent) that evolve their own populations to find the best solution for its associated problem according to their individual and cooperation constraints and objective indexes. Each EA is an optimization problem that runs in parallel and that exchanges some information with the others during its evaluation step. This information is needed to let each EA to measure the coordination objectives of the solutions encoded in its own population, taking into account the possible optimal solutions of the remaining populations of the other EAs. With this purpose, each single EA receives information related to the best solutions of the remaining ones before evaluating the cooperative objectives of each possible solution of its own population.

As the cooperation objective values depend on the best solutions of the other populations and the optimality of a solution depends both on the individual and cooperation objectives, it is not really possible to select and send the best solution of 
each planner to the others. However, MCACEA divides the evaluation step inside each EA in three parts: In the first part, the 
EAs identify the best solution considering only its individual objective values and send it to the others EAs; in the second part, the cooperation objective values of all solutions are calculated taking into account the received information; and in the third part, the EAs calculate the fitness of the solutions considering all the individual and cooperation objective values. 

Although each population can only offer a unique optimal solution, each EA maintains a [[pareto set]] of optimal solutions and selects the unique optimal solution at the end, when the last population has already been obtained. Therefore, to be able to determine a unique optimal solution according with the individual objectives in each generation (and so, using it with the MCACEA framework), a step in charge of selecting the final optimal solution must also be included in the evaluation step of each EA.

==Evaluation phase in MCACEA==
The complete evaluation phase of the individual cooperating EAs is divided in six steps. When searching for the solution of a single EA, only the first two steps of this new evaluation process are used. MCACEA extends this process from these two only steps to the next six:

1. Evaluating the individual objectives of each solution.

2. Calculating the fitness of each solution with the single evaluation function (containing only the individual objectives).

3. Finding the best solution of the population.

4. Sending (and receiving) the best solution to (of) the other single EAs.

5. Calculating the cooperation objectives taking into account the received information from the other EAs.

6. Calculating the fitness of each solution with the complete evaluation function (containing both the individual and the cooperation objectives), which have been obtained in steps 1 and 5.

==Similar approaches==
Although MCACEA may look similar to the habitual parallelization of EAs, in this case, instead of distributing the solutions of the whole problem between different EAs that share their solutions periodically, the algorithm is dividing the problem into smaller problems that are solved simultaneously by each EA taking into account the solutions of the part of the problems that the other EAs are obtaining.

Another possibility,&lt;ref&gt;C. Zheng, L. Li, F. Xu, F. Sun, and M. Ding, ''Evolutionary route planner for unmanned air vehicles,'' IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 21, no. 4, pp. 609–620, Aug. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; is to send the best completely evaluated solutions of the previous generation to the other EAs instead of our current best only individual objective evaluated one. Nevertheless, that approach introduces a bias toward outdated completely evaluated trajectories, while MCACEA does it toward currently good individual objective evaluated ones.

==Applications==
MCACEA has been used for finding and optimizing [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] (UAVs) trajectories when flying simultaneously in the same scenario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~wbl/biblio/gecco2008/docs/p1477.pdf J.

'''Maffia''' (''Maffie'' or ''Mafie'' in [[Czech language|Czech]]) was a [[secret organization]] acting during [[World War I]]. It was founded after emigration of [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] in 1914 by Czech politician [[Edvard Beneš]], who later became second president of [[Czechoslovakia]], and others main anti-royalist ([[Karel Kramář]], [[Alois Rašín]], [[Josef Scheiner]] and [[Přemysl Šámal]]). Maffia was based on the principles of [[Sicilian Mafia]] (name "Maffia"), it was central part of the [[First Czechoslovak Resistance]] and its main objective was to overthrow the [[Emperor of Austria]] and the disintegration of his country. Maffia plot against [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Central Powers]] was revealed by police in 1915, some members of Maffia (Karel Kramář, Alois Rašín, Vincent Červinka and Josef Zamazal) were arrested and sentenced to death (they were later amnestied by [[Charles I of Austria|emperor Charles I.]]) and Edvard Beneš escaped from Austria-Hungary to Switzerland, but subversive activities of Maffia continued, under the leadership of Přemysl Šámal, until the end of the [[First World War]]. Maffia had over 200 members and it was supported from abroad (US, Italy etc.).

'''Mare Insularum''' (the "'''sea of islands'''") is a [[lunar mare]] located in the Insularum basin just south of [[Mare Imbrium]]. The basin material is of the [[Lower Imbrian]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], with the mare material of the [[Upper Imbrian]] epoch. The mare is bordered by the [[Impact crater|crater]]s [[Copernicus (lunar crater)|Copernicus]] on the east, and [[Kepler (lunar crater)|Kepler]] on the west. [[Oceanus Procellarum]] joins the mare to the southwest.

Copernicus is one of the most noticeable craters on the Moon. The rays from both Kepler and Copernicus protrude into the mare. It is located near the crater [[Fra Mauro (crater)|Fra Mauro]], the site of the [[Apollo 14]] landing.  [[Sinus Aestuum]] forms a northeastern extension to the mare.

The name was suggested by lunar geologist [[Donald Wilhelms|Don E. Wilhelms]].&lt;ref&gt;To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration.  Don E. Wilhelms, University of Arizona Press (1993). {{ISBN|978-0816510658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These include classical everyday phases such as [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]] – for example [[water]] exists as ice, liquid water, and gaseous steam – but other states are possible, including [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, [[fermionic condensate]]s, and [[quark–gluon plasma]].&lt;ref name=RHIC&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However this is only somewhat correct, because subatomic particles and their properties are governed by their [[quantum mechanics|quantum nature]], which means they do not act as everyday objects appear to act – they can act like [[wave-particle duality|waves as well as particles]] and they do not have well-defined sizes or positions. In the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]], matter is not a fundamental concept because the [[elementary particle|elementary constituents]] of atoms are [[quantum]] entities which do not have an inherent "size" or "[[volume]]" in any everyday sense of the word. Due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] and other [[fundamental interaction]]s, some "[[point particle]]s" known as [[fermion]]s ([[quark]]s, [[lepton]]s), and many composites and atoms, are effectively forced to keep a distance from other particles under everyday conditions; this creates the property of matter which appears to us as matter taking up space.

For much of the history of the [[natural science]]s people have contemplated the exact nature of matter. The idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks, the so-called ''[[particulate theory of matter]]'', was first put forward by the Greek philosophers [[Leucippus]] (~490 BC) and [[Democritus]] (~470–380 BC).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matter is a general term describing any ''''physical substance''''. By contrast,  [[mass]] is not a substance but rather a quantitative ''property'' of matter and other substances or systems; various types of mass are defined within [[physics]] – including but not limited to [[rest mass]], [[inertial mass]], [[relativistic mass]], [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy]].  

While there are different views on what should be considered matter, the mass of a substance has exact scientific definitions.  Another difference is that matter has an "opposite" called antimatter, but mass has no opposite—there is no such thing as "anti-mass" or [[negative mass]], so far as is known, although scientists do discuss the concept.  Antimatter has the same (i.e. positive) mass property as its normal matter counterpart.

Different fields of science use the term matter in different, and sometimes incompatible, ways. Some of these ways are based on loose historical meanings, from a time when there was no reason to distinguish mass from simply a quantity of matter. As such, there is no single universally agreed scientific meaning of the word "matter". Scientifically, the term "mass" is well-defined, but "matter" can be defined in several ways. Sometimes in the field of physics "matter" is simply equated with particles that exhibit rest mass (i.e., that cannot travel at the speed of light), such as quarks and leptons. However, in both [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], matter exhibits both [[wave]]-like and [[particle]]-like properties, the so-called [[wave–particle duality]].&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;

== Definition ==

=== Based on atoms ===

A definition of "matter" based on its physical and chemical structure is: ''matter is made up of [[atom]]s''.&lt;ref name=Barker0&gt;

 |page=2
 |publisher=John F Morton &amp; Co.
 |isbn=978-1-4460-2206-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such ''atomic matter'' is also sometimes termed ''ordinary matter''. As an example, [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] [[molecule]]s (DNA) are matter under this definition because they are made of atoms. This definition can be extended to include charged atoms and molecules, so as to include [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]s (gases of ions) and [[electrolyte]]s (ionic solutions), which are not obviously included in the atoms definition. Alternatively, one can adopt the [[#Protons, neutrons and electrons definition|''protons, neutrons, and electrons'' definition]].

=== Based on protons, neutrons and electrons ===
A definition of "matter" more fine-scale than the atoms and molecules definition is: ''matter is made up of what [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s are made of'', meaning anything made of positively charged [[proton]]s, neutral [[neutron]]s, and negatively charged [[electron]]s.&lt;ref name=DePodesta1&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition goes beyond atoms and molecules, however, to include substances made from these building blocks that are ''not'' simply atoms or molecules, for example electron beams in an old [[cathode ray tube]] television, or [[white dwarf]] matter—typically, carbon and oxygen nuclei in a sea of degenerate electrons. At a microscopic level, the constituent "particles" of matter such as protons, neutrons, and electrons obey the laws of quantum mechanics and exhibit wave–particle duality. At an even deeper level, protons and neutrons are made up of [[quark]]s and the force fields ([[gluon]]s) that bind them together, leading to the next definition.

=== Based on quarks and leptons ===
[[File:Standard Model of Elementary Particles.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Under the "quarks and leptons" definition, the elementary and composite particles made of the [[quarks]] (in purple) and [[leptons]] (in green) would be matter—while the gauge bosons (in red) would not be matter. However, interaction energy inherent to composite particles (for example, gluons involved in neutrons and protons) contribute to the mass of ordinary matter.]]

As seen in the above discussion, many early definitions of what can be called "ordinary matter" were based upon its structure or "building blocks".  On the scale of elementary particles, a definition that follows this tradition can be stated as: 
"ordinary matter is everything that is composed of [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s", or "ordinary matter is everything that is composed of any elementary fermions except antiquarks and antileptons".&lt;ref name=Povh0&gt;

This third class of particles includes mesons formed by a quark and an antiquark pair (a pair of matter particle and antimatter particle) and bosons which are messengers of known interactions (photons for electromagnetism, W and Z bosons for the weak interaction, gluons for the strong interaction). The antiparticle of a matter particle belongs to the class of antimatter particles, the antiparticle of an antimatter particle belongs to the class of matter particles."

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between these formulations follows.

Leptons (the most famous being the [[electron]]), and quarks (of which [[baryons]], such as [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], are made) combine to form [[atoms]], which in turn form [[molecules]]. Because atoms and molecules are said to be matter, it is natural to phrase the definition as: "ordinary matter is anything that is made of the same things that atoms and molecules are made of". (However, notice that one also can make from these building blocks matter that is ''not'' atoms or molecules.) Then, because electrons are leptons, and protons, and neutrons are made of quarks, this definition in turn leads to the definition of matter as being "quarks and leptons", which are two of the four types of elementary fermions (the other two being antiquarks and antileptons, which can be considered antimatter as described later). Carithers and Grannis state: "Ordinary matter is composed entirely of [[generation (physics)|first-generation]] particles, namely the [up] and [down] quarks, plus the electron and its neutrino."&lt;ref name=Carithers&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, [[mass]] is not something that is exclusive to ordinary matter.

The quark–lepton definition of ordinary matter, however, identifies not only the elementary building blocks of matter, but also includes composites made from the constituents (atoms and molecules, for example). Such composites contain an interaction energy that holds the constituents together, and may constitute the bulk of the mass of the composite. As an example, to a great extent, the mass of an atom is simply the sum of the masses of its constituent protons, neutrons and electrons. However, digging deeper, the protons and neutrons are made up of quarks bound together by gluon fields (see [[Quantum chromodynamics#Dynamics|dynamics of quantum chromodynamics]]) and these gluons fields contribute significantly to the mass of hadrons.&lt;ref name=Aitchison&gt;

The Standard Model groups matter particles into three generations, where each generation consists of two quarks and two leptons. The first generation is the ''[[up quark|up]]'' and ''[[down quark|down]]'' quarks, the ''[[electron]]'' and the ''[[electron neutrino]]''; the second includes the ''[[charm quark|charm]]'' and ''[[strange quark|strange]]'' quarks, the ''[[muon]]'' and the ''[[muon neutrino]]''; the third generation consists of the ''[[top quark|top]]'' and ''[[bottom quark|bottom]]'' quarks and the ''[[tau (particle)|tau]]'' and ''[[tau neutrino]]''.&lt;ref name=Staley&gt;

This quark–lepton definition of matter also leads to what can be described as "conservation of (net) matter" laws—discussed later below.  Alternatively, one could return to the mass–volume–space concept of matter, leading to the next definition, in which antimatter becomes included as a subclass of matter.

=== Based on elementary fermions (mass, volume, and space) ===

A common or traditional definition of matter is "anything that has [[mass]] and [[volume]] (occupies [[space]])".&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite book|author=S.M. Walker |author2=A. King|date=2005|title=What is Matter?|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o7EquxOl4MAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=matter|page=7|publisher=[[Lerner Publications]]|isbn=0-8225-5131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hage&gt;{{cite book| author=J.Kenkel |author2=P.B.

The observation that matter occupies space goes back to antiquity. However, an explanation for why matter occupies space is recent, and is argued to be a result of the phenomenon described in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]],&lt;ref name=Peacock&gt;{{cite book|author=K.A. Peacock| date=2008|title=The Quantum Revolution: A Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ITqnf5jdE5QC&amp;pg=PA47|page=47|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=0-313-33448-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kreiger&gt;{{cite book|author=M.H.

Two particular examples where the exclusion principle clearly relates matter to the occupation of space are white dwarf stars and neutron stars, discussed further below.

Thus, matter can be defined as everything composed of elementary fermions. Although we don't encounter them in everyday life, antiquarks (such as the [[antiproton]]) and antileptons (such as the [[positron]]) are the [[antiparticle]]s of the quark and the lepton, are elementary fermions as well, and have essentially the same properties as quarks and leptons, including the applicability of the Pauli exclusion principle which can be said to prevent two particles from being in the same place at the same time (in the same state), i.e. makes each particle "take up space".  This particular definition leads to matter being defined to include anything made of these [[antimatter]] particles as well as the ordinary quark and lepton, and thus also anything made of [[meson]]s, which are unstable particles made up of a quark and an antiquark.

=== In general relativity and cosmology ===

In the context of [[theory of relativity|relativity]], mass is not an additive quantity, in the sense that one can not add the rest masses of particles in a system to get the total rest mass of the system.&lt;ref name=Penrose/&gt; Thus, in relativity usually a more general view is that it is not the sum of [[rest mass]]es, but the [[Stress–energy tensor|energy–momentum tensor]] that quantifies the amount of matter. This tensor gives the rest mass for the entire system. "Matter" therefore is sometimes considered as anything that contributes to the energy–momentum of a system, that is, anything that is not purely gravity.&lt;ref name=Caroll&gt;

== Structure ==

In particle physics, fermions are particles that obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. Fermions can be elementary, like the electron—or composite, like the proton and neutron. In the [[Standard Model]], there are two types of elementary fermions: quarks and leptons, which are discussed next.

=== Quarks ===
{{Main article|Quark}}
Quarks are particles of [[fermion|spin-{{frac|1|2}}]], implying that they are [[fermion]]s. They carry an [[electric charge]] of −{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|e]] (down-type quarks) or +{{frac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;e (up-type quarks). For comparison, an electron has a charge of −1&amp;nbsp;e. They also carry [[colour charge]], which is the equivalent of the electric charge for the [[strong interaction]]. Quarks also undergo [[radioactive decay]], meaning that they are subject to the [[weak interaction]]. Quarks are massive particles, and therefore are also subject to [[gravity]].

==== Baryonic matter ====
{{main article|Baryon}}
Baryons are strongly interacting fermions, and so are subject to Fermi–Dirac statistics. Amongst the baryons are the protons and neutrons, which occur in atomic nuclei, but many other unstable baryons exist as well. The term [[baryon]] usually refers to triquarks—particles made of three quarks. Also, "exotic" baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark are known as [[pentaquark]]s, but their existence is not generally accepted.

Baryonic matter is the part of the universe that is made of baryons (including all atoms). This part of the universe does not include [[dark energy]], [[dark matter]], [[black holes]] or various forms of degenerate matter, such as compose [[white dwarf]] stars and [[neutron star]]s. Microwave light seen by [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP), suggests that only about 4.6% of that part of the universe within range of the best [[telescope]]s (that is, matter that may be visible because light could reach us from it), is made of baryonic matter. About 26.8% is dark matter, and about 68.3% is dark energy.&lt;ref name="NASA Science Dark Matter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy/ |title=Dark Energy Dark Matter |website=NASA Science: Astrophysics |date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a matter of fact, the great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 per cent of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass–energy density of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

====Hadronic matter====
Hadronic matter can refer to 'ordinary' baryonic matter, made from [[hadron]]s ([[Baryon]]s and [[meson]]s), or [[quark matter]] (a generalisation  of atomic nuclei), ie. the 'low' temperature [[QCD matter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4469 ''The Phase Diagram of Hadronic Matter'']&lt;/ref&gt; It includes [[degenerate matter]] and the result of high energy heavy nuclei collisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/706/3/032001 Modelling Hadronic Matter, D Menzes]&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct from [[dark matter]].

==== Degenerate matter ====
{{main article|Degenerate matter}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] requires that only two fermions can occupy a quantum state, one spin-up and the other spin-down. Hence, at zero temperature, the fermions fill up sufficient levels to accommodate all the available fermions—and in the case of many fermions, the maximum kinetic energy (called the ''[[Fermi energy]]'') and the pressure of the gas becomes very large, and depends on the number of fermions rather than the temperature, unlike normal states of matter.

Degenerate matter is thought to occur during the evolution of heavy stars.&lt;ref name=Goldberg1&gt;

Degenerate matter includes the part of the universe that is made up of neutron stars and white dwarfs.

==== Strange matter ====
{{main article|Strange matter}}
''Strange matter'' is a particular form of [[quark matter]], usually thought of as a ''liquid'' of [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], and [[strange quark|strange]] [[quark]]s. It is contrasted with [[nuclear matter]], which is a liquid of [[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s (which themselves are built out of up and down quarks), and with non-strange quark matter, which is a quark liquid that contains only up and down quarks. At high enough density, strange matter is expected to be [[color superconductor|color superconducting]]. Strange matter is hypothesized to occur in the core of [[neutron star]]s, or, more speculatively, as isolated droplets that may vary in size from [[femtometer]]s ([[strangelet]]s) to kilometers ([[quark star]]s).

===== Two meanings of the term "strange matter" =====

In [[particle physics]] and [[astrophysics]], the term is used in two ways, one broader and the other more specific.
# The broader meaning is just quark matter that contains three flavors of quarks: up, down, and strange. In this definition, there is a critical pressure and an associated critical density, and when nuclear matter (made of [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]) is compressed beyond this density, the protons and neutrons dissociate into quarks, yielding quark matter (probably strange matter).
# The narrower meaning is quark matter that is ''more stable than nuclear matter''. The idea that this could happen is the "strange matter hypothesis" of Bodmer&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this definition, the critical pressure is zero: the true ground state of matter is ''always'' quark matter. The nuclei that we see in the matter around us, which are droplets of nuclear matter, are actually [[metastable]], and given enough time (or the right external stimulus) would decay into droplets of strange matter, i.e. [[strangelet]]s.

=== Leptons ===
{{Main article|Lepton}}

Leptons are particles of [[fermion|spin-{{frac|1|2}}]], meaning that they are [[fermion]]s. They carry an [[electric charge]] of −1&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|e]] (charged leptons) or 0&amp;nbsp;e (neutrinos). Unlike quarks, leptons do not carry [[colour charge]], meaning that they do not experience the [[strong interaction]]. Leptons also undergo radioactive decay, meaning that they are subject to the [[weak interaction]]. Leptons are massive particles, therefore are subject to gravity.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A phase is a form of matter that has a relatively uniform chemical composition and physical properties (such as [[density]], [[specific heat]], [[refractive index]], and so forth). These phases include the three familiar ones ([[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, and [[gas]]es), as well as more exotic states of matter (such as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s, [[superfluid]]s, [[supersolid]]s, [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, ...). A ''[[fluid]]'' may be a liquid, gas or plasma. There are also [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] and [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] phases of [[magnetic material]]s. As conditions change, matter may change from one phase into another. These phenomena are called [[phase transition]]s, and are studied in the field of [[thermodynamics]]. In nanomaterials, the vastly increased ratio of surface area to volume results in matter that can exhibit properties entirely different from those of bulk material, and not well described by any bulk phase (see [[nanomaterials]] for more details).

Phases are sometimes called ''states of matter'', but this term can lead to confusion with [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic states]]. For example, two gases maintained at different pressures are in different ''thermodynamic states'' (different pressures), but in the same ''phase'' (both are gases).

== Antimatter ==
{{main article|Antimatter}}
{{unsolved|physics|[[Baryon asymmetry]]. Why is there far more matter than antimatter in the observable universe? }}
In [[particle physics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], ''antimatter'' is matter that is composed of the [[antiparticle]]s of those that constitute ordinary matter. If a particle and its antiparticle come into contact with each other, the two [[annihilation|annihilate]]; that is, they may both be converted into other particles with equal [[energy]] in accordance with [[Einstein]]'s equation {{nowrap|[[E=MC2|''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]}}. These new particles may be high-energy [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s) or other particle–antiparticle pairs. The resulting particles are endowed with an amount of kinetic energy equal to the difference between the [[rest mass]] of the products of the annihilation and the rest mass of the original particle–antiparticle pair, which is often quite large.  Depending on which definition of "matter" is adopted, antimatter can be said to be a particular subclass of matter, or the opposite of matter.

Antimatter is not found naturally on Earth, except very briefly and in vanishingly small quantities (as the result of [[radioactive decay]], [[lightning]] or [[cosmic ray]]s). This is because antimatter that came to exist on Earth outside the confines of a suitable physics laboratory would almost instantly meet the ordinary matter that Earth is made of, and be annihilated. Antiparticles and some stable antimatter (such as [[antihydrogen]]) can be made in tiny amounts, but not in enough quantity to do more than test a few of its theoretical properties.

There is considerable speculation both in [[science]] and [[science fiction]] as to why the observable universe is apparently almost entirely matter (in the sense of quarks and leptons but not antiquarks or antileptons), and whether other places are almost entirely antimatter (antiquarks and antileptons) instead. In the early universe, it is thought that matter and antimatter were equally represented, and the disappearance of antimatter requires an asymmetry in physical laws called [[CP violation|CP (charge-parity) symmetry violation]], which can be obtained from the Standard Model,&lt;ref name=CP&gt;

== Conservation of matter ==

Two quantities that can define an amount of matter in the quark–lepton sense (and antimatter in an antiquark–antilepton sense), [[baryon number]] and [[lepton number]], are [[conservation law|conserved]] in the Standard Model. A [[baryon]] such as the proton or neutron has a baryon number of one, and a quark, because there are three in a baryon, is given a baryon number of 1/3.  So the net amount of matter, as measured by the number of quarks (minus the number of antiquarks, which each have a baryon number of −1/3), which is proportional to baryon number, and number of leptons (minus antileptons), which is called the lepton number, is practically impossible to change in any process.   Even in a nuclear bomb, none of the baryons (protons and neutrons of which the atomic nuclei are composed) are destroyed—there are as many baryons after as before the reaction, so none of these matter particles are actually destroyed and none are even converted to non-matter particles (like photons of light or radiation).  Instead, [[nuclear binding energy|nuclear]] (and perhaps [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy|chromodynamic) binding energy]] is released, as these baryons become bound into mid-size nuclei having less energy (and, [[Mass–energy equivalence|equivalently]], less [[mass per nucleon|mass) per nucleon]] compared to the original small (hydrogen) and large (plutonium etc.) nuclei.  Even in [[electron–positron annihilation]], there is no net matter being destroyed, because there was zero net matter (zero total lepton number and baryon number) to begin with before the annihilation—one lepton minus one antilepton equals zero net lepton number—and this net amount matter does not change as it simply remains zero after the annihilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So the only way to really "destroy" or "convert" ordinary matter is to pair it with the same amount of antimatter so that their "matterness" cancels out—but in practice there is almost no antimatter generally available in the universe (see [[baryon asymmetry]] and [[leptogenesis (physics)|leptogenesis]]) with which to do so.

==Historical development==

===Antiquity (c. 610 BC–c. 322 BC) ===
The [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]] were among the first recorded speculators about the underlying nature of the visible world. [[Thales]] (c. 624 BC–c. 546 BC) regarded water as the fundamental material of the world. [[Anaximander]] (c. 610 BC–c. 546 BC) posited that the basic material was wholly characterless or limitless: the Infinite (''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]''). [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (flourished 585 BC, d. 528 BC) posited that the basic stuff was ''pneuma'' or air. [[Heraclitus]] (c. 535–c. 475 BC) seems to say the basic element is fire, though perhaps he means that all is change. [[Empedocles]] (c. 490–430 BC) spoke of four [[Classical element|element]]s of which everything was made: earth, water, air, and fire.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |author=S. Toulmin |author2=J. Goodfield
 |date=1962
 |title=The Architecture of Matter
 |publisher=University of Chicago Press
 |pages=48–54
 |isbn=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Parmenides]] argued that change does not exist, and [[Democritus]] argued that everything is composed of minuscule, inert bodies of all shapes called atoms, a philosophy called [[atomism]]. All of these notions had deep philosophical problems.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed by Aristotle in ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', esp. book I, but also later; as well as ''Metaphysics'' I–II.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] (384 BC – 322 BC) was the first to put the conception on a sound philosophical basis, which he did in his natural philosophy, especially in [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']] book I.&lt;ref&gt;For a good explanation and elaboration, see {{cite book
 |author=R.J. Connell
 |date=1966
 |title=Matter and Becoming
 |publisher=Priory Press
 |isbn=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted as reasonable suppositions the four [[Classical element|Empedoclean elements]], but added a fifth, [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]. Nevertheless, these elements are not basic in Aristotle's mind. Rather they, like everything else in the visible world, are composed of the basic ''principles'' matter and form.

{{quotation|For my definition of matter is just this—the primary substratum of each thing, from which it comes to be without qualification, and which persists in the result.|Aristotle|Physics I:9:192a32}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Aristotle's conception of matter is intrinsically linked to something being made or composed. In other words, in contrast to the early modern conception of matter as simply occupying space, matter for Aristotle is definitionally linked to process or change: matter is what underlies a change of substance. For example, a horse eats grass: the horse changes the grass into itself; the grass as such does not persist in the horse, but some aspect of it—its matter—does. The matter is not specifically described (e.g., as [[atom]]s), but consists of whatever persists in the change of substance from grass to horse. Matter in this understanding does not exist independently (i.e., as a [[Substance theory|substance]]), but exists interdependently (i.e., as a "principle") with form and only insofar as it underlies change. It can be helpful to conceive of the relationship of matter and form as very similar to that between parts and whole. For Aristotle, matter as such can only ''receive'' actuality from form; it has no activity or actuality in itself, similar to the way that parts as such only have their existence ''in'' a whole (otherwise they would be independent wholes).

===Seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ===

[[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) originated the modern conception of matter. He was primarily a geometer. Instead of, like Aristotle, deducing the existence of matter from the physical reality of change, Descartes arbitrarily postulated matter to be an abstract, mathematical substance that occupies space:
{{quotation|So, extension in length, breadth, and depth, constitutes the nature of bodily substance; and thought constitutes the nature of thinking substance. And everything else attributable to body presupposes extension, and is only a mode of extended|René Descartes|Principles of Philosophy&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Descartes, matter has only the property of extension, so its only activity aside from locomotion is to exclude other bodies:&lt;ref&gt;though even this property seems to be non-essential (René Descartes, ''Principles of Philosophy'' II [1644], "On the Principles of Material Things", no. 4.)&lt;/ref&gt; this is the [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]]. Descartes makes an absolute distinction between mind, which he defines as unextended, thinking substance, and matter, which he defines as unthinking, extended substance.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |author=R. Descartes
 |chapter=The Principles of Human Knowledge
 |date=1644
 |title=Principles of Philosophy I
 |pages=8, 54, 63
 |publisher=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are independent things. In contrast, Aristotle defines matter and the formal/forming principle as complementary ''principles'' that together compose one independent thing ([[Substance theory|substance]]). In short, Aristotle defines matter (roughly speaking) as what things are actually made of (with a ''potential'' independent existence), but Descartes elevates matter to an actual independent thing in itself.

The continuity and difference between Descartes' and Aristotle's conceptions is noteworthy. In both conceptions, matter is passive or inert. In the respective conceptions matter has different relationships to intelligence. For Aristotle, matter and intelligence (form) exist together in an interdependent relationship, whereas for Descartes, matter and intelligence (mind) are definitionally opposed, independent [[Substance theory|substances]].&lt;ref&gt;

Descartes' justification for restricting the inherent qualities of matter to extension is its permanence, but his real criterion is not permanence (which equally applied to color and resistance), but his desire to use geometry to explain all material properties.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Burtt, ''Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday and Company, 1954), 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Descartes, Hobbes, Boyle, and Locke argued that the inherent properties of bodies were limited to extension, and that so-called secondary qualities, like color, were only products of human perception.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. McGuire and P.M. Heimann, "The Rejection of Newton's Concept of Matter in the Eighteenth Century", ''The Concept of Matter in Modern Philosophy'' ed. Ernan McMullin (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1978), 104–118 (105).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) inherited Descartes' mechanical conception of matter. In the third of his "Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy", Newton lists the universal qualities of matter as "extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and inertia".&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton, ''Mathematical Principles of
Natural Philosophy'', trans. A. Motte, revised by F. Cajori (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1934), pp. 398–400. Further analyzed by Maurice A. Finocchiaro, "Newton's Third Rule of Philosophizing: A Role for Logic in Historiography", ''Isis'' 65:1 (Mar. 1974), pp. 66–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in ''Optics'' he conjectures that God created matter as "solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles", which were "...even so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces".&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton, ''Optics'', Book III, pt. 1, query 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The "primary" properties of matter were amenable to mathematical description, unlike "secondary" qualities such as color or taste. Like Descartes, Newton rejected the essential nature of secondary qualities.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire and Heimann, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton developed Descartes' notion of matter by restoring to matter intrinsic properties in addition to extension (at least on a limited basis), such as mass. Newton's use of gravitational force, which worked "at a distance", effectively repudiated Descartes' mechanics, in which interactions happened exclusively by contact.&lt;ref name=Chomsky/&gt;

Though Newton's gravity would seem to be a ''power'' of bodies, Newton himself did not admit it to be an ''essential'' property of matter. Carrying the logic forward more consistently, [[Joseph Priestley]] (1733–1804) argued that corporeal properties transcend contact mechanics: chemical properties require the ''capacity'' for attraction.&lt;ref name=Chomsky/&gt; He argued matter has other inherent powers besides the so-called primary qualities of Descartes, et al.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire and Heimann, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nineteenth and twentieth centuries===
Since Priestley's time, there has been a massive expansion in knowledge of the constituents of the material world (viz., molecules, atoms, subatomic particles), but there has been no further development in the ''definition'' of matter. Rather the question has been set aside. [[Noam Chomsky]] (born 1928) summarizes the situation that has prevailed since that time:
{{quotation|What is the concept of body that finally emerged?[...] The answer is that there is no clear and definite conception of body.[...] Rather, the material world is whatever we discover it to be, with whatever properties it must be assumed to have for the purposes of explanatory theory. Any intelligible theory that offers genuine explanations and that can be assimilated to the core notions of physics becomes part of the theory of the material world, part of our account of body. If we have such a theory in some domain, we seek to assimilate it to the core notions of physics, perhaps modifying these notions as we carry out this enterprise. |Noam Chomsky|''Language and problems of knowledge: the Managua lectures'', p. 144&lt;ref name=Chomsky&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

So matter is whatever physics studies and the object of study of physics is matter: there is no independent general definition of matter, apart from its fitting into the methodology of measurement and controlled experimentation. In sum, the boundaries between what constitutes matter and everything else remains as vague as the [[demarcation problem]] of delimiting science from everything else.&lt;ref&gt;Nevertheless, it remains true that the mathematization regarded as requisite for a modern physical theory carries its own implicit notion of matter, which is very like Descartes', despite the demonstrated vacuity of the latter's notions.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, following the development of the [[periodic table]], and of [[atomic theory]], [[atom]]s were seen as being the fundamental constituents of matter; atoms formed [[molecules]] and [[compound (chemistry)|compounds]].&lt;ref name=Wenham&gt;

The common definition in terms of occupying space and having mass is in contrast with most physical and chemical definitions of matter, which rely instead upon its structure and upon attributes not necessarily related to volume and mass. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the knowledge of matter began a rapid evolution.

Aspects of the Newtonian view still held sway. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] discussed matter in his work ''Matter and Motion''.&lt;ref name=Maxwell&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carefully separates "matter" from space and time, and defines it in terms of the object referred to in [[Newton's first law of motion]].

However, the Newtonian picture was not the whole story. In the 19th century, the term "matter" was actively discussed by a host of scientists and philosophers, and a brief outline can be found in Levere.&lt;ref name=Levere&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Three divisions of matter are recognized in science: masses, molecules and atoms. &lt;br /&gt;A Mass of matter is any portion of matter appreciable by the senses. &lt;br /&gt;A Molecule is the smallest particle of matter into which a body can be divided without losing its identity. &lt;br /&gt;An Atom is a still smaller particle produced by division of a molecule. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than simply having the attributes of mass and occupying space, matter was held to have chemical and electrical properties. In 1909 the famous physicist [[J. J. Thomson]] (1856–1940) wrote about the "constitution of matter" and was concerned with the possible connection between matter and electrical charge.&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;

In the late 19th century with the [[Thomson experiment|discovery]] of the [[electron]], and in the early 20th century, with the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment|discovery]] of the [[atomic nucleus]], and the birth of [[particle physics]], matter was seen as made up of electrons, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s interacting to form atoms. Today, we know that even protons and neutrons are not indivisible, they can be divided into [[quark]]s, while electrons are part of a particle family called [[lepton]]s. Both [[#Quarks and leptons definition|quarks and leptons]] are [[elementary particle]]s, and are currently seen as being the fundamental constituents of matter.&lt;ref name=Povh1&gt;
The history of the concept of matter is a history of the fundamental ''length scales'' used to define matter. Different building blocks apply depending upon whether one defines matter on an atomic or elementary particle level. One may use a definition that matter is atoms, or that matter is [[hadron]]s, or that matter is leptons and quarks depending upon the scale at which one wishes to define matter.

These quarks and leptons interact through four [[fundamental forces]]: [[gravity]], [[electromagnetism]], [[weak interaction]]s, and [[strong interaction]]s.

As one consequence, mass and energy (which cannot be created or destroyed) cannot always be related to matter (which can be created out of non-matter particles such as photons, or even out of pure energy, such as kinetic energy). Force carriers are usually not considered matter: the carriers of the electric force (photons) possess energy (see [[Planck relation]]) and the carriers of the weak force ([[W and Z bosons]]) are massive, but neither are considered matter either.&lt;ref name=PhotonsMatter&gt;

==Summary==
The modern conception of matter has been refined many times in history, in light of the improvement in knowledge of just ''what'' the basic building blocks are, and in how they interact.
The term "matter" is used throughout physics in a bewildering variety of contexts: for example, one refers to "[[condensed matter physics]]",&lt;ref name=Chaikin&gt;

The candidate for the chairperson of the NDRC is nominated by the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]] and approved by the [[National People's Congress]]. Since February 2017 the Commission has been headed by [[He Lifeng]].

The NDRC's functions are to study and formulate policies for economic and social development, maintain the balance of economic development, and to guide restructuring of China's economic system.&lt;ref name="NDRC" /&gt; The NDRC has twenty-six functional departments/bureaus/offices with an authorized staff size of 890 [[civil servant]]s.

'''Neptunism''' is a [[Superseded scientific theories|superseded scientific theory]] of [[geology]] proposed by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] (1749–1817) in the late 18th century, proposing that [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s formed from the [[crystal]]lisation of [[mineral]]s in the early [[Earth]]'s oceans.

The theory took its name from [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] god of the sea. There was considerable debate between its proponents (neptunists) and those favouring a rival theory known as [[plutonism]] which gave a significant role to volcanic origins, and which in modified form replaced neptunism in the early 19th century as the principle of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] was shown to fit better with the geological facts as they became better known.

Modern geology acknowledges many different forms of rock formation, and explains the formation of [[sedimentary rock]] through processes very similar to those described by neptunism.

==Historical development==
In the mid-eighteenth century as the investigation of [[geology]] found evidence such as [[fossil]]s, [[natural history|naturalists]] developed new ideas which diverged from the [[Genesis creation narrative]]. [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Georges de Buffon]] proposed that the Earth was over 75,000 years old, possibly much older, and showed signs of historical development in a series of distinct [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]]s.

[[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] was the inspector of mines and professor of mining and [[mineralogy]] at the Mining Academy in [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]] ([[Saxony]]) which became dominant in late eighteenth-century geology. His ''Short Classification and Description of Rocks'' of 1787&lt;ref&gt;This probably  should say "''Short classification and description of the various rocks''"; See e.g. {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his lectures set out a classification of rocks on the basis of their age based on the sequence of layers of differing material, rather than by the types of minerals as had been previous practice.

He based his historical sequence of rock formation on the theory that the Earth had originally consisted of water. According to this account, the water contained material which settled out of suspension in a process of [[sedimentation]] to form the core of the planet and the continents as a series of layers, the oldest and hardest being [[granite]] while newer layers showed an increasing number of [[fossil]]s. [[Volcano]]s had a minor effect, modifying the continents and adding more sediment as well as some volcanic rocks, and successive lesser floods added more layers, so that most rocks resulted from [[precipitate]]s settling out of water.  There is no indication that any of the floods in Werner's cosmogony were [[Noah's flood]].&lt;ref&gt;Ospovat, Alexander, "Werner, Abraham Gottlob," ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography'', pp. 256–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The neptunist–plutonist controversy ==
A rival theory known as [[plutonism]] (or vulcanism) held that rocks were formed in fire. This was originally proposed by Abbé [[Anton Moro]] (1687–1750) with reference to his studies of volcanic islands, and was taken up by [[James Hutton]] who put forward a [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarian]] theory of a [[rock cycle]] extending over infinite time in which rocks were worn away by weathering and erosion, then were re-formed and uplifted by heat and pressure.

Neptunists differed from the plutonists in holding that [[basalt]] was a sedimentary deposit which included fossils and so could not be of volcanic origin. Hutton correctly asserted that basalt never contained fossils and was always insoluble, hard, and crystalline. He found geological formations in which basalt cut through layers of other rocks, supporting his theory that it originated from molten rock under the Earth's crust.

The debate was not just between scientists. [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], one of the most respected authors of the day, took sides with the neptunists. The fourth act of his famous work ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' contains a dialogue between a neptunist and a plutonist, the latter being [[Mephistopheles]], the antagonist of the play who is a devil. Doing so he implicitly expressed his favour for the neptunist theory, though he also did so explicitly and sometimes even harshly elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Raman| first=V. V.| title=Ugandan Martyrs and James Hutton| date=June 3, 2002|newspaper=The Global Spiral| volume=6| issue=3| url=http://www.metanexus.net/Magazine/Default.aspx?TabId=68&amp;id=6447&amp;SkinSrc=%5BG%5DSkins%2F_default%2FNo+Skin&amp;ContainerSrc=%5BG%5DContainers%2F_default%2FNo+Container| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928032113/http://www.metanexus.net/Magazine/Default.aspx?TabId=68&amp;id=6447&amp;SkinSrc=%5BG%5DSkins%2F_default%2FNo+Skin&amp;ContainerSrc=%5BG%5DContainers%2F_default%2FNo+Container| dead-url=yes| archive-date=September 28, 2007| accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy lasted into the early years of the 19th century, but the works of [[Charles Lyell]] in the 1830s gradually won over support for the uniformitarian ideas of Hutton and the plutonists. However, [[sedimentary rock]]s such as [[limestone]] are considered to have resulted from processes like those described by the neptunists, and so modern theory can be seen as a synthesis of the two approaches.{{who said|date=October 2017}}

==Notable neptunists==
* [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] (1749–1817)
* [[Juan Ignacio Molina]] (1740–1829): indirectly expressed support in ''Ensayo sobre la historia natural de Chile'' where he pointed out the fact that [[basalt]] occurred both in the Andes and in coast of [[Chiloé Archipelago|Chiloé]] where there were no sign of eruption and believed basalt to be a sort of compacted [[slate]] with vesicles.  
* [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832)
*[[Robert Jameson]] (1774–1854): studied with Werner and became the first eminent exponent in Britain of neptunism, at the [[University of Edinburgh]] argued against the followers of [[James Hutton]].
* [[Gustav Bischof]], (1792–1870), founder of geochemistry; introduced chemical analysis into widespread use in geology.

==Fictional account==
The theory, and its intellectual context, are treated in [[Daniel Kehlmann]]'s fictionalised account of the travels of Alexander von Humboldt, ''Die Vermessung der Welt'' (''[[Measuring the World]]'') of 2006.

An '''oceanarium''' can be either a [[marine mammal park]], such as [[MarineLand]], or a large-scale [[Public aquarium|aquarium]], such as the [[Lisbon Oceanarium]], presenting an [[ocean]] habitat with [[marine (ocean)|marine]] animals, especially large ocean dwellers such as [[shark]]s.

== First marine mammal parks==
{{Main article|Marine mammal park}}
[[Marineland of Florida]], one of the first [[theme park]]s in [[Florida]], United States, started in 1938, claims to be "the world's first oceanarium"

Marineland of Florida was developed as ''Marine Studios'' near [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in [[Marineland, Florida]], which was followed in [[Florida]] by [[Miami Seaquarium]], opened in 1955 and in [[California]] by [[Marineland of the Pacific]], opened in 1954 near [[Los Angeles]], and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom|Marine World, Africa USA]], opened in 1968 near [[San Francisco]].

==SeaWorld==
{{Main article|SeaWorld}}

[[SeaWorld San Diego]] was opened in 1964, developed by four fraternity brothers Milt Shedd, Ken Norris, David DeMott and George Millay.
[[SeaWorld]] Aurora opened in 1970 near [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].
[[SeaWorld Orlando]] was opened in 1973.
SeaWorld (San Diego, Aurora, Orlando) was sold to [[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]] (a publishing company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]) in 1976. 
They purchased Marineland of the Pacific in 1986 and closed the [[park]].
They had opened [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] in 1988.
In 1989 they sold SeaWorld (San Diego, Aurora, Orlando, San Antonio) to [[Anheuser-Busch]], the world's largest brewer and owner of the [[Busch Gardens]] Safari Parks, for US$1.1 billion. 
In 2001, Anheuser-Busch sold the [[Ohio]] [[park]] which finally ceased its activities in 2004.

== World's largest marine life park ==

When the 170,000-square-foot Oceanarium at the [[Shedd Aquarium]] in [[Chicago]] opened on April 27, 1991, it debuted as the largest indoor marine mammal facility in the world. The position as world's oceanarium has since shifted repeatedly in recent years. From 2005 to 2012 it was the [[Georgia Aquarium]] in the United States with an initial total water volume of {{convert|8500000|USgal|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, later it expanded to {{convert|10000000|USgal|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, and home to 100–120,000 animals of 700 species. In 2012 it was surpassed by [[Marine Life Park]] in [[Singapore]] with a total water volume of {{convert|45000|m3|USgal|abbr=on}} and over 100,000 [[animals]] of more than 800 species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.cnn.com/singapore/play/singapore-open-worlds-largest-oceanarium-610811|title=World's largest oceanarium opens|work=CNNGo Staff|publisher=CNN|date=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Singapore park was surpassed by the [[Chimelong Ocean Kingdom]] in China, the current record holder, with a total water volume of {{convert|48750|m3|USgal|-4|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=guinnessworldrecords&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/3/chinas-hengqin-ocean-kingdom-confirmed-as-worlds-largest-aquarium-as-attraction-sets-five-world-records-56471/|title = China’s Hengqin Ocean Kingdom confirmed as world’s largest aquarium as attraction sets five world records |publisher = Guinness World Records|date = 31 March 2014|accessdate = 9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marine public aquariums ==
[[File:Afrykarium tunel.jpg|thumb| The largest tank of the [[Africarium|Afrykarium]] in [[Wrocław]] shows the depths of the [[Mozambique Channel]], where sharks, rays, and other large [[pelagic fish]] can be viewed from this 18 meter long underwater [[acrylic tunnel]].]]
Modern marine aquariums try to create natural environments. A host of marine animals swim together in the four-story cylindrical tank of the [[New England Aquarium]] in [[Boston]], which opened in 1969.
At the [[National Aquarium in Baltimore]], which opened in 1981, a walkway spirals up through the center of two gigantic cylindrical tanks, the Atlantic Coral Reef and the Shark Alley, which display sharks, sawfish, and other sea creatures.
Since then, many new aquariums have sought even greater realism, often concentrating on local environments. The richly endowed [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] in California, which opened in 1984, is an outstanding example.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Leighton R., ''Aquariums: Windows to Nature'', Prentice Hall General Reference, New York, 1993. {{ISBN|0-671-85019-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Africarium|Afrykarium]] is the only themed oceanarium devoted solely to exhibiting the [[fauna of Africa]] and located in [[Wrocław, Poland]]. A part of the [[Wrocław Zoo]], the idea behind the Afrykarium is to comprehensively present selected ecosystems from the continent of [[Africa]]. Housing over 10 thousand animals, its breadth extends from housing insects such cockroaches to the large mammals like the elephants on an area of over 33 [[hectare]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Isler |first1=Danuta |title=A trip to Wroclaw Afrykarium |url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/6/Artykul/365527,A-trip-to-Wroclaw-Afrykarium |website=Radio Poland |publisher=Radio Poland}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Operation Argus''' was a series of United States low-yield, high-atmosphere [[nuclear testing|nuclear weapons tests]] and [[missile]] tests secretly conducted during August and September 1958 over the [[Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mundey|first=Lisa|date=2012|title=The Civilianization of a Nuclear Weapons Effects Test: Operation ARGUS|url=|journal=Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences|volume=42|pages=283–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ARGUS tests took 11 days from start to finish with the first launch on August 27 and the final launch on September 6.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They were performed by the [[Defense Nuclear Agency]], in conjunction with the [[Explorer 4]] space mission.

* Two missiles, with warheads 136–227&amp;nbsp;kg to be launched within one month of each other, originating from a single site.
* The missiles were to be detonated at altitudes of 200–1,000&amp;nbsp;mi, and also at 2,000–4,000 miles. Both detonations should occur near the [[geomagnetic equator]].
* Satellites were to be placed in equatorial (up to 30°) and polar (up to 70°) orbits, with [[perigee]]s of roughly {{convert|322|km}} and apogees of roughly {{convert|2900|km}} or greater. These [[satellite]]s were to be used to measure [[electron density]] over time, and include a [[magnetometer]], as well as a means for measuring ambient [[Noise (radio)|radio noise]]. Measurements were to be taken before the shots to determine a baseline, as well as during and after the events.
* [[Sounding rocket]]s, fired from appropriate ground locations, were to carry the same instrumentation as the satellites, except for radio noise. Ground stations to be used to study effects on radio astronomy and radar probing as well as auroral measurements.

Originally ''Argus'' was designated ''Hardtack-Argus'', and later ''Floral''. For reasons of security, both names were dropped in favor of the independent name ''Argus''.

Funding was provided by the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]] (AFSWP), the predecessor of today's [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] (DTRA). Total funds allotted for the project were [[US Dollar|US$]] 9,023,000.

==Task Force 88==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
[[File:Task Force 88 track chart during Operation Argus 1958.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Path of TF-88 during August and September 1958.]]

The [[United States Navy]] Task Force 88 (or TF-88), was formed April 28, 1958. TF-88 was organized solely to conduct ''Operation Argus''. Once ''Argus'' was completed, the task force was dissolved, and its records dispersed. Some of these records have been destroyed or lost in the intervening time period. Of particular note among the missing documents were the film records (which recorded radiation levels during the ''Argus'' tests). This has proved contentious due to the higher-than-normal number of [[leukemia]] claims among TF-88 participants to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]]. Because of this, it has been difficult to resolve just how much radiation participants were exposed to.

[[USS Norton Sound (AVM-1)|''USS Norton Sound'']] was a United States [[Navy]]-guided missile ship responsible for missile-launching functions. She also served as a training facility for crews involved in the testing. The [[Lockheed X-17|X-17A missiles]] to be used in the test were unfamiliar to those conducting the tests. Exercises including assembly and repair of dummy missiles were conducted aboard ''Norton Sound''. She also carried a 27-MHz [[COZI]] radar, which was operated by [[Air force|Air Force]] [[Cambridge Research Center]], which was used to monitor effects of the shots. She was responsible for the launching of three low-yield nuclear warheads into the high [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[USS Albemarle (AV-5)|''USS Albemarle'']], fresh out of an [[wikt:overhaul|overhaul]], was not listed on the TF-88 order. She set out to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic,]] supposedly on shakedown. She, too, mounted a COZI radar and other instrumentation for detecting man-made [[ionization]]. This instrumentation included IGY [[radiometer]]s, [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]s, [[radar]], and optical equipment. After this equipment was added, she sailed to the ocean around the area of the Azores to record data at the conjugate point, as the rest of task force 88 headed to the South Atlantic to conduct the tests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[USS Tarawa (CV-40)|''USS Tarawa'']] served as overall command of the operation, with her commander serving as Task Group Commander. She carried an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] [[MSQ-1A]] radar and communication system for missile tracking. She also housed [[VS-32]] aircraft for search and security operations as well as scientific measurement, photographic, and observer missions for each shot. [[HS-5]] was also aboard and provided intra-task-force transportation for personnel and cargo.

[[USS Warrington (DD-843)|''USS Warrington'']], in conjunction with [[USS Bearss (DD-654)|''Bearss'']], [[USS Hammerberg (DE-1015)|''Hammerberg'']], and [[USS Courtney (DE-1021)|''Courtney'']] maintained a weather [[Picket (military)|picket]] 463&amp;nbsp;km west of the task force, provided a plane guard for ''Tarawa'' during [[Flight operations quality assurance|flight operations]], and carried out standard destroyer functions (such as surface security and search and rescue). ''Warrington'' also carried equipment for launching [[Loki Dart]] rockets.

[[USS Neosho (AO-143)|''USS Neosho'']] refueled task force ships during the operation. She was also outfitted with Air Force MSQ-1A radar. Her commanding officer also served as the [[flagship]] for TG 88.3, the Mobile Logistics Group, consisted of: ''Neosho'', equipped with [[United States Air Force|USAF]] MSQ-1 radar and communication vans, USS ''Salamonie'' (AO-26), and assigned destroyers.

[[USS Salamonie (AO-26)|''USS Salamonie'']] returned to the United States upon arrival at TF-88, and did not participate in any shots.

==Tracking Systems – The satellites==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
}}
Two satellite launches were attempted in order to obtain data from these high-altitude tests.  [[Explorer 4]] was successfully launched on July 26. Explorer 4 Successfully rode an Army Jupiter-C missile to orbit from Cape Canaveral. The [[satellite]] contained enough [[Battery (electricity)|battery power]] to function for sixty days. This was long enough for the [[satellite]] to track and measure ARGUS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[Explorer 5]] suffered a launch failure on August 24.

There were many tracking systems used by the task force along with these satellites along with many organizations that helped track these missiles.  "These included the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], the Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Laboratory, the [[Army Map Service]], the [[Naval Ordnance Test Station]], and the [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] along with ground tracking stations from the [[Aleutian Islands]] through the [[Azores]] from academic, industrial, and military organizations." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Preparation==
To prepare for the launch of the ARGUS missiles, many tests and preparations were conducted. As the east coast units of TF 88 were heading towards the [[Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]], they participated in countdown, launch, and missile- tracking drills using [[Loki (rocket)|Loki/Dart]] high-altitude, antiaircraft rockets fired from the USS Warrington. Fourteen of these Loki launches were conducted from August 12 to 22. These tests were conducted to test equipment and procedures, and to train personnel in specialized assignments. Some of these assignments necessary for the ARGUS missile launchings  were "stationing of ships, MSQ-1A [[Radar tracker|radar tracking]] by the [[USS Neosho (AO-143)|''USS Neosho'']] and the [[USS Tarawa (LHA-1)|USS Tarawa]], communications, positioning of sky-camera S2F aircraft, and area surveillance S2F aircraft."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Tests==

[[File:Operation Argus launch.jpg|right|thumb|250px|One of the modified [[Lockheed X-17|X-17A missiles]] launches from the [[USS Norton Sound (AVM-1)|USS ''Norton Sound'']] as part of ''Operation Argus''.]]

About 1800&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Cape Town]], South Africa, [[USS Norton Sound (AVM-1)|USS ''Norton Sound'']] launched three modified [[Lockheed X-17|X-17A missiles]] armed with 1.7 [[kiloton|kt]] [[W25 nuclear warhead|W-25]] [[nuclear weapon|nuclear warheads]] into the upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], where [[high altitude nuclear explosion]]s took place. Due to the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]], the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] is closer to the Earth's surface at that location. The (extreme) altitude of the tests was chosen so as to prevent personnel involved in the test from being exposed to any [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency. ''DTRA Fact Sheets,'' "Operation Argus." November 2006. [http://www.dtra.mil/documents/ntpr/factsheets/Argus.pdf]. Retrieved June 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the very low threat of radiation exposure, precautions were taken to prevent radiological exposure. The task force commander and his staff had laid out a series of precautionary radiation safe measures to be followed in each stage of the operation. Even though the chance of exposure to radiation from these missiles was so minute, the safety measures were still carried out as directed by the commander by the crew of task force 88.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Coordinated measurement programs involving satellite, rocket, aircraft, and surface stations were employed by the [[US Military|services]] as well as other government agencies and various contractors worldwide.

The Argus explosions created artificial [[electron]] belts resulting from the [[beta decay|β-decay]] of [[Nuclear fission|fission]] fragments. These lasted for several weeks. Such radiation belts affect radio and [[radar]] transmissions, damage or destroy arming and [[Fuse (explosives)|fusing]] mechanisms of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] [[warhead]]s, and endanger crews of [[orbit]]ing [[space vehicle]]s. It was found after running these tests that the explosions did in fact degrade the reception and transmission of radar signals, another proof that Christofilos was correct about the Christofilos effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''Argus'' proved the validity of Christofilos' theory: the establishment of an electron shell derived from neutron and β-decay of fission products and ionization of device materials in the upper atmosphere was demonstrated. It not only provided data on military considerations, but produced a "great mass" of geophysical data.

The tests were first reported by Hanson Baldwin and Walter Sullivan of the ''[[New York Times]]'' on March 19, 1959, headlining it as the "greatest scientific experiment ever conducted." This was an unauthorized publication that caused an uproar in the scientific community because many of them were unaware of the presence of artificial particles in the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Approximately nine ships and 4,500 people participated in the operation. After the completion of testing, the task force returned to the United States via [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil.

The tests were announced the following year, but the full results and documentation of the tests were not declassified until April 30, 1982.

The '''Oslo Graben''' or '''Oslo Rift''' is a [[graben]] formed during a geologic [[Rift (geology)|rifting]] event in [[Permian]] time, the last phase of the [[Variscan orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|author1=Larsen, Bjørn |author2=Olaussen, Snorre |author3=Sundvoll, Bjørn |author4=Heeremans, Michel }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main graben forming period began in the late [[Carboniferous]], which culminated with rift formation and [[volcano|volcanism]], with associated [[rhomb porphyry]] [[lava]] flows. This activity was followed by [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]]ing, and ended with [[intrusion]]s about 65 million years after the onset of the formation. It is located in the area around the [[Norway|Norwegian]] capital [[Oslo]].

The lava production was high when the rhomb porphyry lavas were deposited. The lavas reflect a period of abundant earthquake-related movements, when strong forces tore the crust apart.

In the [[Vestfold]] district, one lava flow was deposited on average every 250,000 years, resulting in a 3000-metre thick sequence of mainly volcanic material. In the [[Oslo]] area, lavas were deposited on average every 800,000 years. Only a few plant remains have been found between these lavas. The bedrock in this area, roughly from [[Skien]] to Oslo and [[Mjøsa]], results in soil rich in nutrients important for plant growth.

Since the Permian, [[erosion]] has removed the volcanic peaks and indeed most of the lava layer and laid bare the [[magma chamber]]s and [[volcanic pipe]]s deep below, allowing scientist a rare view of what goes on beneath a [[rift|rift valley]]. Several of the old magma plumes are now quarried, the rich black [[Larvikite]] (named from [[Larvik]], a town south of Oslo) being  one.

The [[Särna alkaline complex]] in western Sweden, also of Late Carboniferous age, is thought to be related to the Oslo Graben as it is aligned to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Palaeomagnetic and Rb-Sr isotopic evidence for the age of the Särna alkaline complex, western central Sweden|volume=10|issue=1|year=1977|pages=73–79|publisher=[[Lithos (journal)|Lithos]]|first1=G.|last1=Bylund|first2=P.J.|last2=Patchett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21523">In the [[power systems|power systems analysis]] field of [[electrical engineering]], a '''per-unit system'''  is the expression of system quantities as fractions of a defined base unit quantity. Calculations are simplified because quantities expressed as per-unit do not change when they are referred from one side of a transformer to the other. This can be a pronounced advantage in power system analysis where large numbers of transformers may be encountered. Moreover, similar types of apparatus will have the impedances lying within a narrow numerical range when expressed as a per-unit fraction of the equipment rating, even if the unit size varies widely. Conversion of per-unit quantities to volts, ohms, or amperes requires a knowledge of the base that the per-unit quantities were referenced to. The per-unit system is used in [[Power flow study|power flow]], [[short circuit]] evaluation, [[motor starting methods|motor starting]] studies etc.

The main idea of a per unit system is to absorb large differences in absolute values into base relationships. Thus, representations of elements in the system with per unit values become more uniform.

A per-unit system provides units for [[electric power|power]], [[voltage]], [[Current (electricity)|current]], [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], and [[admittance]]. With the exception of impedance and admittance, any two units are independent and can be selected as base values; power and voltage are typically chosen. All quantities are specified as multiples of selected base values.  For example, the base power might be the rated power of a [[transformer]], or perhaps an arbitrarily selected power which makes power quantities in the system more convenient.  The base voltage might be the nominal voltage of a [[Busbar|bus]].  Different types of quantities are labeled with the same symbol ('''pu'''); it should be clear whether the quantity is a voltage, current, or other unit of measurement.

==Purpose==

There are several reasons for using a per-unit system:
* Similar apparatus (generators, transformers, lines) will have similar per-unit impedances and losses expressed on their own rating, regardless of their absolute size. Because of this, per-unit data can be checked rapidly for gross errors. A per unit value out of normal range is worth looking into for potential errors.
* Manufacturers usually specify the impedance of apparatus in per unit values. 
* Use of the constant &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \sqrt{3} &lt;/math&gt; is reduced in three-phase calculations. 
* Per-unit quantities are the same on either side of a transformer, independent of voltage level
* By normalizing quantities to a common base, both hand and automatic calculations are simplified. 
* It improves numerical stability of automatic calculation methods.
* Per unit data representation yields important information about relative magnitudes.
The per-unit system was developed to make manual analysis of power systems easier.  Although power-system analysis is now done by computer, results are often expressed as per-unit values on a convenient system-wide base.

== Base quantities ==
Generally base values of power and voltage are chosen. The base power may be the rating of a single piece of apparatus such as a motor or generator. If a system is being studied, the base power is usually chosen as a convenient round number such as 10 MVA or 100 MVA. The base voltage is chosen as the nominal rated voltage of the system. All other base quantities are derived from these two base quantities. Once the base power and the base voltage are chosen, the base current and the base impedance are determined by the natural laws of electrical circuits. The base value should only be a magnitude, while the per-unit value is a phasor. The phase angles of complex power, voltage, current, impedance, etc., are not affected by the conversion to per unit values.

The purpose of using a per-unit system is to simplify conversion between different transformers. Hence, it is appropriate to illustrate the steps for finding per-unit values for voltage and impedance. First, let the base power (S_base) of each end of a transformer become the same. Once every S is set on the same base, the base voltage and base impedance for every transformer can easily be obtained. Then, the real numbers of impedances and voltages can be substituted into the per-unit calculation definition to get the answers for the per-unit system. If the per-unit values are known, the real values can be obtained by multiplying by the base values.

By convention, the following two rules are adopted for base quantities:

* The base power value is the same for the entire power system of concern.
* The ratio of the voltage bases on either side of a transformer is selected to be the same as the ratio of the transformer voltage ratings.

With these two rules, a per-unit impedance remains unchanged when referred from one side of a transformer to the other. This allows the ideal transformer to be eliminated from a transformer model.

==Relationship between units==

The relationship between units in a per-unit system depends on whether the system is [[single-phase]] or [[three-phase]].

===Single-phase===

Assuming that the independent base values are power and voltage, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the base value for power may be given in terms of [[Reactive power|reactive]] or [[apparent power]], in which case we have, respectively,

: &lt;math&gt;Q_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;S_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

The rest of the units can be derived from power and voltage using the equations &lt;math&gt;S = IV&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P = S\cos(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q = S\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt; \underline{V} = \underline{I} \underline{Z}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Ohm's law]]), &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; being represented by &lt;math&gt; \underline{Z} = R + j X = Z\cos(\phi) + j Z\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.  We have:

: &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{base}} = \frac{S_{\text{base}}}{V_{\text{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{base}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}}{I_{\text{base}}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}^{2}}{I_{\text{base}}V_{\text{base}}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}^{2}}{S_{\text{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\mathrm{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

===Three-phase===

Power and voltage are specified in the same way as single-phase systems.  However, due to differences in what these terms usually represent in three-phase systems, the relationships for the derived units are different. Specifically, power is given as total (not per-phase) power, and voltage is line-to-line voltage.
In three-phase systems the equations &lt;math&gt;P = S\cos(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q = S\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; also hold. The apparent power &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; now equals &lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{base}}= \sqrt{3}V_{\mathrm{base}} I_{\mathrm{base}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{S_{\mathrm{base}}}{V_{\mathrm{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{base}}}{I_{\mathrm{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = \frac{{V_{\mathrm{base}}^2}}{S_{\mathrm{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\mathrm{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

==Example of per-unit==

As an example of how per-unit is used, consider a three-phase power transmission system that deals with powers of the order of 500 MW and uses a nominal voltage of 138 kV for transmission.  We arbitrarily select &lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{base}} = 500\, \mathrm{MVA}&lt;/math&gt;, and use the nominal voltage 138 kV as the base voltage &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{base}}&lt;/math&gt;.  We then have:

: &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{base}} = \frac{S_{\text{base}}}{V_{\text{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = 2.09 \, \mathrm{kA}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{base}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}}{I_{\text{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}^{2}}{S_{\text{base}}} = 38.1 \, \Omega&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\mathrm{base}}} = 26.3 \, \mathrm{mS}&lt;/math&gt;

If, for example, the actual voltage at one of the buses is measured to be 136 kV, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{pu}} = \frac{V}{V_{\mathrm{base}}} = \frac{136 \, \mathrm{kV}}{138 \, \mathrm{kV}} = 0.9855 \, \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

== In transformers ==
It can be shown that voltages, currents, and impedances in a per-unit system will have the same values whether they are referred to primary or secondary of a [[transformer]].&lt;ref name="Sen 1997"&gt;{{cite book | last=Sen | first=P. C. | title=Principles of electric machines and power electronics | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location=New York | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-471-02295-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85}}

For instance, for voltage, we can prove that the per unit voltages of two sides of the transformer, side 1 and side 2, are the same. Here, the per-unit voltages of the two sides are E&lt;sub&gt;1p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E_{1,pu}&amp;=\frac{E_{1}}{V_{base1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {N_{1}E_{2}}{N_{2}V_{base1}} \\
&amp;= \frac {N_{1}E_{2}}{N_{2} \frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}} V_{base2}}\\
&amp;= \frac {E_{2}} {V_{base2}}\\
&amp;= E_{2,pu}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
 (source: Alexandra von Meier Power System Lectures, UC Berkeley)

‘E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the voltages of sides 1 and 2 in volts. N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns the coil on side 1 has. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns the coil on side 2 has. V&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt; are the base voltages on sides 1 and 2. &lt;math&gt; V_{base1}=\frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}V_{base2}&lt;/math&gt;

For current, we can prove that the per-unit currents of the two sides are the same below.
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I_{1,pu}&amp;=\frac{I_{1}}{I_{base1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {N_{2}I_{2}}{N_{1}I_{base1}} \\
&amp;= \frac {N_{2}I_{2}}{N_{1} \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} I_{base2}}\\
&amp;= \frac {I_{2}} {I_{base2}}\\
&amp;= I_{2,pu}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
 (source: Alexandra von Meier Power System Lectures, UC Berkeley)

where I&lt;sub&gt;1p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; are the per-unit currents of sides 1 and 2 respectively. In this, the base currents I&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt; are related in the opposite way that V&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt; are related, in that

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I_{base1} &amp;= \frac{S_{base1}} {V_{base1}}\\
S_{base1} &amp;= S_{base2}\\
V_{base2} &amp;= \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} V_{base1}\\
I_{base2} &amp;= \frac{S_{base2}} {V_{base2}}\\
I_{base1} &amp;= \frac{S_{base2}} { \frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}} V_{base2}}\\
&amp;= \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} I_{base2}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reason for this relation is for power conservation
S&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; = S&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt;

The full load [[copper loss]] of a transformer in per-unit form is equal to the per-unit value of its resistance:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_{cu,FL}&amp;=\text{full-load copper loss}\\
&amp;= I_{R1}^2R_{eq1}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_{cu,FL,pu}&amp;=\frac{P_{cu,FL}}{P_{base}}\\
&amp;= \frac {I_{R1}^2R_{eq1}} {V_{R1}I_{R1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {R_{eq1}} {V_{R1}/I_{R1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {R_{eq1}} {Z_{B1}}\\
&amp;= R_{eq1,pu}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, it may be more useful to express the resistance in per-unit form as it also represents the full-load copper loss.&lt;ref name="Sen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|86}}

As stated above, there are two degrees of freedom within the per unit system that allow the engineer to specify any per unit system. The degrees of freedom are the choice of the base voltage (V{{sub|base}}) and the base power (S{{sub|base}}). By convention, a single base power (S{{sub|base}}) is chosen for both sides of the transformer and its value is equal to the rated power of the transformer. By convention, there are actually two different base voltages that are chosen, V{{sub|base1}} and V{{sub|base2}} which are equal to the rated voltages for either side of the transformer. By choosing the base quantities in this manner, the transformer can be effectively removed from the circuit as described above. For example:

Take a transformer that is rated at 10 kVA and 240/100 V. The secondary side has an impedance equal to 1∠0° ohms. The base impedance on the secondary side is equal to:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{base,2}&amp;=\frac{V_{base,2}^2}{S_{base}}\\
&amp;= \frac {10000} {10000}\\
&amp;= \text {1 ohm}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the per unit impedance on the secondary side is 1∠0° ohm / 1 ohm = 1∠0° p.u. When this impedance is referred to the other side, the impedance becomes:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{2}&amp;=\left(\frac{240}{100}\right)^2\times\text{1∠0° ohm}\\
&amp;= \text {5.76∠0° ohm}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The base impedance for the primary side is calculated the same way as the secondary:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{base,1}&amp;=\frac{V_{base,1}^2}{S_{base}}\\
&amp;= \frac {57600} {10000}\\
&amp;= \text {5.76 ohm}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the per unit impedance is 5.76∠0° ohm / 5.76 ohm = 1∠0° p.u. which is the same as when calculated from the other side of the transformer, as would be expected.

Another useful tool for analyzing transformers is to have the base change formula that allows the engineer to go from a base impedance with one set of a base voltage and base power to another base impedance for a different set of a base voltage and base power. This becomes especially useful in real life applications where a transformer with a secondary side voltage of 1.2 kV might be connected to the primary side of another transformer whose rated voltage is 1 kV. The formula is as shown below.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{base,new}&amp;=Z_{base,old}\times\left(\frac{V_{base,old}}{V_{base,new}}\right)^2\times\left(\frac{S_{base,new}}{S_{base,old}}\right)\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Pindus Mountains mixed forests''' constitute a terrestrial [[ecoregion]] of [[Europe]] according to both the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]]. It belongs to the [[biome]] of [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]], and to the [[Palearctic ecozone]].

The [[Pindus]] Mountains mixed forests are situated in the [[montane]] parts of the southern [[Balkans]] in the wide altitudinal range above 300–500 m. They cover [[Taygetus]] on the [[Peloponnesus]] in the south, occur in the mountain ranges of [[Central Greece]] (including the [[Pindus]]), eastern [[Albania]] and the southwestern part of the [[Republic of Macedonia]], extend to the [[Drin River]] valley in the north and occupy 39,500&amp;nbsp;km² (15,300 sq. mi) in the three countries.

The ecoregion is landlocked and surrounded by the [[Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests]] (in Greece), [[Illyrian deciduous forests]] (in Greece and Albania), [[Dinaric Mountains mixed forests]] (in Albania to the north of the Drin) and [[Balkan mixed forests]] (in [[Kosovo]], Macedonia and Greece).

The climate of the ecoregion is mostly of [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]'s [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] type with hot summers (Csa). 

Due to the wide altitudinal range of this ecoregion the highest elevations (above 1,000-1,400 m) are covered with coniferous forests, with a mixed broadleaf zone occurring lower. The coniferous forests are dominated by ''[[Pinus nigra]]'' subsp. ''nigra'' var. ''pallasiana'', ''[[Abies cephalonica]]'' and ''[[Abies borisii-regis|A. borisii-regis]]'', with deciduous [[European Beech]] in the north. ''[[Juniperus foetidissima]]'' occurs widely near the [[tree line]]. The dominant species on the lower elevations are remarkably diverse, including ''[[Aesculus hippocastanum]]'' (in more damp places) and various deciduous oaks (''[[Quercus frainetto]]'', ''[[Quercus pubescens|Q. pubescens]]'', ''[[Quercus cerris|Q. cerris]]'', ''[[Quercus trojana|Q. trojana]]'', ''[[Quercus petraea|Q. petraea]]''). Evergreen oaks, mainly ''[[Quercus calliprinos|Q. calliprinos]]'', and other Mediterranean [[sclerophyll]] shrubland species are abundant on dry and rocky south-facing slopes.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the ecoregion is shared between the East Mediterranean province of the [[Mediterranean Region]] and the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Holarctic Kingdom]] ([[Armen Takhtajan]]'s delineation).

'''Provenance''' in [[geology]], is the reconstruction of the origin of [[sediments]]. The Earth is a dynamic planet, and all rocks are subject to transition between the three main rock types: [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]], [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]], and [[igneous rock]]s (the [[rock cycle]]). Rocks exposed to the surface are sooner or later broken down into sediments. Sediments are expected to be able to provide evidence of the [[erosion]] history of their parent source rocks. The purpose of provenance study is to restore the [[tectonic]], [[Paleogeography|paleo-geographic]] and [[Paleoclimatology|paleo-climatic]] history.

In the modern geological lexicon, "sediment provenance" specifically refers to the application of compositional analyses to determine the origin of sediments. This is often used in conjunction with the study of exhumation histories, interpretation of drainage networks and their evolution, and forward-modelling of paleo-earth systems. In combination, these help to characterise the "source to sink" journey of clastic sediments from [[hinterland]] to [[sedimentary basin]].

== Introduction ==

[[Provenance]] (from the French provenir, "to come from"), is the place of origin or earliest known history of something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In geology (specifically, in [[sedimentary petrology]]), the term provenance deals with the question where sediments originate from. The purpose of sedimentary provenance studies is to reconstruct and to interpret the history of sediment from parent rocks at a source area to detritus at a burial place.&lt;ref name="Jan Weltje 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jan Weltje and Eynatten|title=Quantitative provenance analysis of sediments: review and outlook|journal=Sedimentary Geology|date=2004|doi=10.1016/j.sedgeo.2004.05.007|volume=171|pages=1–11|bibcode=2004SedG..171....1W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of provenance studies is to investigate the characteristics of a source area by analyzing the composition and texture of sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pettijohn, F.J.|title=Sand and sandstone|publisher=Springer|page=553|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies of provenance involve the following aspects: "(1) the source(s) of the particles that make up the rocks, (2) the erosion and transport mechanisms that moved the particles from source areas to depositional sites, (3) the depositional setting and depositional processes responsible for sedimentation of the particles (the depositional environment), and (4) the physical and chemical conditions of the burial environment and diagenetic changes that occur in siliciclastic sediment during burial and uplift".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boggs|first1=Sam|title=Petrology of sedimentary Rocks|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provenance studies are conducted to investigate many scientific questions, for example, the growth history of continental crust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor and McLennan|title=The Geochemical Evolution of the continental crust|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|date=1995|doi=10.1029/95rg00262|bibcode=1995RvGeo..33..241T|volume=33|issue=2|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLennan, S.

"Relations between provenance and basin are important for hydrocarbon exploration because sand frameworks of contrasting [[detrital]] compositions respond differently to [[diagenesis]], and thus display different trends of [[porosity]] reduction with depth of burial."&lt;ref name = "Dickinson 1979"/&gt;

== Source of detritus ==
All rock exposed at the Earth's surface is subjected to physical or chemical [[weathering]] and broken down into finer grained sediment. All three types of rocks (igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks) can be the source of detritus.

== Transportation of detritus ==
[[File:Distribution of detritus.png|thumbnail|Left|Distribution of detritus]]
Rocks are transported downstream from higher elevation to lower elevation. Source rocks and detritus are transported by gravity, water, wind or glacial movement. The transportation process breaks rocks into smaller particles by physical abrasion, from big boulder size into sand or even clay size. At the same time minerals within the sediment can also be changed chemically, only minerals that are more resistant to chemical weathering can survive (e.g. ultrastable minerals [[zircon]], [[tourmaline]] and [[rutile]]). During the transportation, minerals can be sorted by their density, and as a result, light minerals like quartz and mica can be moved faster and further than heavy minerals (like zircon and tourmaline).

== Accumulation of detritus ==

After a certain distance of transportation, detritus reaches a sedimentary basin and accumulates in one place. With the accumulation of sediments, sediments are buried to a deeper level and go through [[diagenesis]], which turns separate sediments into sedimentary rocks (i.e. [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[sandstone]], [[mudrock]]s, [[limestone]] etc.) and some [[metamorphic rock]]s (such as [[quartzite]]) which were derived from sedimentary rocks. After sediments are weathered and eroded from mountain belts, they can be carried by stream and deposited along rivers as river sands. Detritus can also be transported and deposited in [[foreland basin]]s and at offshore fans. The detrital record can be collected from all these places and can be used in provenance studies.&lt;ref name="Clift 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="White 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alizai 2011"/&gt;

== Reworking of detritus ==
After detritus are eroded from source area, they are transported and deposited in river, foreland basin or flood plain. Then the detritus can be eroded and transported again when flooding or other kinds of eroding events occur. This process is called as reworking of detritus. And this process could be problematic to provenance studies.&lt;ref name = "Campbell 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell, I. H.|title=He-Pb double dating of detrital zircons from the Ganges and Indus rivers; implication for quantifying sediment recycling and provenance studies|journal=Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.|date=2005|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2005.06.043|bibcode=2005E&amp;PSL.237..402C|volume=237|issue=3–4|pages=402–432}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, U-Pb [[Detrital zircon geochronology|zircon ages]] are generally considered to reflect the time of zircon crystallization at about 750° Celsius and zircon is resistant to physical abrasion and chemical weathering. So zircon grains can survive from multiple cycles of reworking. This means if the zircon grain is reworked (re-eroded) from a foreland basin (not from original mountain belt source area) it will lose information of reworking (detrital record will not indicate the foreland basin as a source area but will indicate the earlier mountain belt as a source area). To avoid this problem, samples can be collected close to the mountain front, upstream from which there is no significant sediment storage.&lt;ref name="Alizai 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alizai,A.|title=Sediment provenance, reworking and transport processes in the Indus River by U–Pb dating of detrital zircon grains|journal=Global and Planetary Change|date=2011|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.11.008 |display-authors=etal|volume=76|pages=33–55|bibcode=2011GPC....76...33A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of provenance methods ==
The study of sedimentary provenance involves several geological disciplines, including [[mineralogy]], [[geochemistry]], geochronology, [[sedimentology]], igneous and metamorphic [[petrology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haughton and Morton|chapter=Sedimentary provenance studies|editors=Morton, A.C., Todd, S.P. &amp; Haughton, P.D.W. |title=Developments in Sedimentary Provenance Studies |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of provenance methods are heavily dependent on the development of these mainstream geological disciplines. The earliest provenance studies were primarily based on [[paleocurrent]] analysis and [[petrographic]] analysis (composition and texture of sandstone and conglomerate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krumberin and Sloss|title=Stratigraphy and Sedimentology (2nd edition)|date=1963|publisher=W.H.Freeman and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, provenance studies shifted to interpret [[tectonic]] settings (i.e. magmatic arcs, collision orogens and continental blocks) using sandstone composition.&lt;ref name = "Dickinson 1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dickinson and Suczek|title=Plate Tectonics and Sandstone Compositions|journal=AAPG Bulletin|date=1979|doi=10.1306/2f9188fb-16ce-11d7-8645000102c1865d|volume=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, bulk rock geochemistry techniques are applied to interpret provenance linking geochemical signatures to source rocks and tectonic settings. Later, with the development of chemical and isotopic micro-analysis methods and geochronological techniques(e.g. [[ICP-MS]], [[SHRIMP]]), provenance researches shifted to analyze single mineral grains. The following table has examples of where provenance study samples are collected.

== Provenance methods ==

Generally, provenance methods can be sorted into two categories, which are petrological methods and geochemical methods. Examples of petrological methods include QFL ternary diagram, [[heavy mineral]] assemblages ([[apatite]]–[[tourmaline]] index, [[garnet]] [[zircon]] index), [[clay mineral]] assemblages and [[illite]] [[crystallinity]], reworked fossils and [[palynomorph]]s, and stock magnetic properties. Examples of geochemical methods include zircon U-Pb dating (plus [[Hafnium|Hf]] isotope), zircon [[fission track]], apatite fission track, bulk sediment Nd and Sr isotopes, garnet chemistry, [[pyroxene]] chemistry, [[amphibole]] chemistry and so on. There is a more detailed list below with references to various types of provenance methods.

== Examples of provenance methods ==

=== Sandstone composition and plate tectonics ===

This method is widely used in provenance studies and it has the ability to link sandstone composition to tectonic setting. This method is described in the Dickinson and Suczek 1979 paper.&lt;ref name = "Dickinson 1979"/&gt; Detrital framework modes of sandstone suites from different kinds of basins are a function of provenance types governed by plate tectonics. (1)[[Quartzose sandstone|Quartzose sand]]s from continental [[cratons]] are widespread within interior basins, platform successions, miogeoclinal wedges, and opening ocean basins. (2)[[Arkosic|Arkosic sand]]s from uplifted basement blocks are present locally in [[Trough (geology)|rift trough]]s and in wrench basins related to transform ruptures. (3)Volcaniclastic [[Lithic fragment (geology)|lithic]] sand and more complex volcano-[[plutonic]] sands derived from [[Forearc|magmatic arc]]s are present in trenches, [[forearc]] basins and [[marginal sea]]s. (4) Recycled [[orogenic]] sands, rich in quartz or [[chert]] plus other lithic fragments and derived from [[Subduction|subduction complexe]]s, collision orogens, and foreland uplifts, are present in closing ocean basins. Triangular diagrams showing framework proportions of quartz, the two feldspars, polycrystalline quartzose lithics, and unstable lithics of volcanic and sedimentary parentage successfully distinguish the key provenance types."&lt;ref name = "Dickinson 1979"/&gt;

The age dated from these minerals indicate timing of [[crystallization]] and multiple tectono-thermal events.

This property make these detrital mineral ideal to record long history of crystallization of tectonically complex source area.

The figure to the right is an example of [[uranium–lead dating|U–Pb]] relative age probability diagram.&lt;ref name = "DeCelles 2004"/&gt; The upper plot shows foreland basin detrital zircon age distribution. The lower plot shows hinterland (source area) zircon age distribution. In the plots, n is the number of analyzed zircon grains. So for [[foreland basin]] Amile formation, 74 grains are analyzed. For source area (divided into 3 tectonic level, Tethyan Himalaya, Greater Himalaya and [[Lesser Himalaya]]), 962, 409 and 666 grains are analyzed respectively. To correlate [[hinterland]] and [[Headland|foreland]] data, let's see the source area record first, Tethyan sequence have age peak at ~500 Myr, 1000 Myr and 2600 Myr, Greater Himalaya has age peaks at ~1200 Myr and 2500 Myr, and Lesser Himalaya sequence has age peaks at ~1800 Ma and 2600 Ma. By simply comparing the foreland basin record with source area record, we cam see that Amile formation resemble age distribution of Lesser Himalaya. It has about 20 grains with age ~1800 Myr ([[Paleoproterozoic]]) and about 16 grains yield age of ~2600 Myr ([[Archean]]). Then we can interpret that sediments of Amile formation are mainly derived from the Lesser Himalaya, and rocks yield ago of Paleoproterozoic and Archean are from the [[Indian craton]]. So the story is: Indian plate collide with Tibet, rocks of Indian craton deformed and involved into Himalayan thrust belt (e.g. Lesser Himalaya sequence), then eroded and deposited at foreland basin.

U–Pb geochronology of zircons was conducted by laser ablation multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ([[ICPMS|LA-MC-ICPMS]]).

== Lab data acquisition and instruments ==
[[File:SHRIP II.JPG|thumbnail|left|Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP II) at Curtin University, Western Australia]]
To pick suitable lab data acquisition to sediment provenance, grain size should be taken into consideration. For conglomerates and boulders, as original mineral [[paragenesis]]is preserved, almost all analytical methods can be used to study the provenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuthbert, S.J.|title=Evolution of the Devonian Hornelen basin, west Norway: new constraints from petrological studies of metamorphic clasts. In: Morton, A.C., Todd, S.P., Haughton, P.D.W. (Eds.), Developments in Sedimentary Provenance Studies|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|date=1991|doi=10.1144/gsl.sp.1991.057.01.25|volume=57|pages=343–360}}&lt;/ref&gt; For finer grained sediments, as they always lose paragenetic information, only a limited range of analytical methods can be used.

Lab data acquisition approaches for provenance study fall into the following three categories: (1) analyzing bulk composition to extract petrographic, mineralogical and chemical information. (2) analyzing specific groups of minerals such as heavy minerals and (3) analyzing single mineral grains about morphological, chemical and isotopic properties.

For bulk composition analysis, samples are crushed, powdered and disintegrated or melted. Then measurement of major and trace and rare-earth (REE) elements are conducted by using instruments like [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]] (AAS), [[X-ray fluorescence]](XRF), [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA) etc.

Sand-sized sediments are able to be analyzed by single-grain methods. Single-grain methods can be divided into the following three groups: (1) Microscopic-morphological techniques, which are used to observe shape, color and internal structures in minerals.

== Problems and limitations of provenance studies ==
[[File:Source to basin.png|thumbnail|right|Main steps (middle), modification processes (right) and controlling factors (left) of sediment evolution.]]
During the pathway of detritus transported from source area to basin, the detritus is subject to weathering, transporting, mixing, deposition, diagenesis and recycling. The complicated process can modify parents lithology both compositionally and textually. All these factors pose certain limits on our capability to restore the characteristics of source rocks from the properties of the produced detrital record. The following paragraphs briefly introduce major problems and limitations of provenance studies.&lt;ref name="JohnssonBasu1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark J. Johnsson|author2=Abhijit Basu|title=Processes Controlling the Composition of Clastic Sediments|url=|date=1 January 1993|publisher=Geological Society of America|isbn=978-0-8137-2284-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Candidate source area ===
To correlate sediments (detrital record) to source area, several possible source area need to be chosen for comparison. In this process, possible source area where sediment is from may be missed and not chosen as a candidate source area. This could cause misinterpretation in correlation sediment to source later.

=== Grain size ===
Grain size could cause misinterpretation of provenance studies. During transportation and deposition, detritus is subject to mechanical breakdown, chemical alternation and sorting. This always results in a preferential enrichment of specific materials in a certain range of grain-size, and sediment composition tends to be a function of grain size. For instance, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ratios decrease with decreasing of grain size because Al-rich phyllosilicate enriches at the expense of Si-rich phase in fine-grained detritus. This means the changing of composition of detrital record could reflect effect of sorting of grain size and not only changing of provenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ingersoll|title=The effect of grain size on detrital mode: a test of the Gazzi-Dickinson point-counting method|journal=Journal of Sedimentary Petrology|date=1984|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; To minimize the influence of sedimentary sorting on provenance method (like Sr-Nd isotopic method), only very fine-grained to fine-grained sandstones are collected as samples but medium-grained sandstones can be used when alternatives are unavailable.&lt;ref name ="Najman 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Najman |display-authors=etal |title=Early Himalayan exhumation: Isotopic constraints from the Indian foreland basin|journal=Terra Nova|date=2000|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3121.2000.00268.x|volume=12|pages=28–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mixing of detritus ===
Mixing of detritus from multiple sources may cause problems with correlating the final detrital record to source rocks, especially when dispersal pathways are complex and involve recycling of previously deposited sediments. For example, in a detrital record, there are zircon grains with the age of 1.0 billion years, but there are two source areas upstream that yield 1.0 billion years old zircon and rivers drained through both area. Then we couldn't determine which area the detritus is derived from.

=== Diagenesis ===
Diagenesis could be a problem when analyzing detrital records especially when dealing with ancient sediments which are always lithified.&lt;ref name = "Giles 1997"/&gt; Variation of clay minerals in detrital record may not reflect variation of provenance rock, but burial effect. For example, clay minerals become unstable at great depth, kaolinite and smectite become illte. If there is a downward increasing trend of illite components in a drilling core, we can not conclude that early detrital record indicate more illite-yield source rock but possibly as a result of burial and alternation of minerals&lt;ref name= "Giles 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giles, M. R.|title=Diagenesis: A Quantitative Perspective— Implications for Basin Modelling and Rock Property Prediction|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|date=1997|isbn=9780792348146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinterland structural assumption ===
[[File:Structural assumption.png|thumbnail|left|Structural assumption influence on provenance interpretation, left two cross sections are two hinterland structural assumptions and the right column is a foreland basin stratigraphy which shows variations of detrital record. Ma = Million year]]
As a provenance study tries to correlate detrital record (which is stored in basins) to hinterland [[stratigraphy]], and [[hinterland]] stratigraphy is structurally controlled by fault systems, so hinterland structural setting is important to interpretation of the detrital record. Hinterland structural setting is estimated by field mapping work. Geologists work along river valleys and traverse mountain belts (thrust belt), locate major faults and describe major stratigraphy bounded by faults in the area. A geologic map is the product of field mapping work, and cross sections can be constructed by interpreting a geologic map. However, a lot of assumptions are made during this process, so the hinterland structural settings are always assumptions. And these assumptions can affect interpretation of detrital record. Here is an example, the right figure shows a classic thrust belt and foreland basin system, the thrust fault carries overlying rocks to the surface and rocks of various [[lithology]] are eroded and transported to deposit at the foreland basin. In structural assumption 1, the pink layer is assumed to exist above thrust 2 and thrust 3, but in the 2nd assumption, the pink layer is only carried by thrust 2. Detrital records are stored in foreland basin stratigraphy. Within the stratigraphy, the pink layer is correlated to the hinterland pink layer. If we use structural assumption 2, we can interpret that thrust 2 was active about 12 and 5 million years ago. But when using the other assumption, we couldn't know if the pink layer record indicates activity of thrust 2 or 3.

== Sediment provenance studies in hydrocarbon exploration and production ==
A combination usage of multiple provenance methods (e.g.[[petrography]], [[heavy mineral analysis]], mineral geochemistry, wholerock geochemistry, geochronology and drainage capture analysis)can provide valuable insights to all stages of [[hydrocarbon]] exploration and production.&lt;ref name = "Smyth 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smyth |first=H. |title=Sediment provenance studies in hydrocarbon exploration and production: an introduction|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications |date=2012|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1144/sp386.21|volume=386|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R. A. |last1=Scott |first2=H. R. |last2=Smyth |first3=A. C. |last3=Morton |first4=N. |last4=Richardson |year=2014|title=Sediment Provenance Studies in Hydrocarbon Exploration and Production|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications |volume=386 |doi=10.1144/sp386.0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In exploration stage, provenance studies can enhance the understanding of reservoir distribution and reservoir quality. These will affect chance of success of exploration project; In development stage, mineralogical and chemical techniques are widely used to estimate reservoir zonation and correlation of stratigraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee |first=M. R.|title=Peristeritic plagioclase in North Sea hydrocarbon reservoir rocks: Implications for diagenesis, provenance and stratigraphic correlation|journal=American Mineralogist|date=2003|display-authors=etal|doi=10.2138/am-2003-5-616|volume=88|issue=5–6|pages=866–875|bibcode=2003AmMin..88..866L}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, these provenance techniques are also used in production stage. For example, they are used to assess permeability variations and well decline rate resulting from spatial variability in [[diagenesis]] and depositional facies &lt;ref name = "Smyth 2012"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6758">[[Image:RREA Monte Carlo simulation.png|thumb|right|350px|RREA simulation showing electrons (black), photons (blue), and positrons (red)]]
A '''relativistic runaway electron avalanche''' ('''RREA''') is an [[electron avalanche|avalanche growth]] of a population of [[relativistic particle|relativistic]] [[electron]]s driven through a material (typically air) by an electric field. RREA has been hypothesized to be related to [[lightning]] initiation,&lt;ref name="Gurevich2005" /&gt; [[terrestrial gamma-ray flashes]],&lt;ref name="Dwyer2005" /&gt; [[Sprite (lightning)|sprite lightning]],&lt;ref name="Lehtinen1999" /&gt; and [[Electric spark|spark]] development.&lt;ref name="lpia" /&gt; RREA is unique as it can occur at electric fields an order of magnitude lower than the [[dielectric strength]] of the material.

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Runaway electron dynamic friction in air.svg|thumb|right|350px|Dynamic friction of free electrons in air compared to an applied electric field showing the runaway electron energy range]]

When an electric field is applied to a material, free electrons will drift slowly through the material as described by the [[electron mobility]]. For low-energy electrons, faster drift velocities result in more interactions with surrounding particles. These interactions create a form of [[friction]] that slow the electrons down. Thus, for low-energy cases, the electron velocities tend to stabilize.

At higher energies, above about 100 [[Electronvolt|keV]], these collisional events become less common as the [[mean free path]] of the electron rises. These higher-energy electrons thus see less frictional force as their velocity increases. In the presence of the same electric field, these electrons will continue accelerating, "running away".

As runaway electrons gain energy from an electric field, they occasionally collide with atoms in the material, knocking off secondary electrons. If the secondary electrons also have high enough energy to run away, they too accelerate to high energies, produce further secondary electrons, etc. As such, the total number of energetic electrons grows exponentially in an avalanche.

==Seeding==
The RREA mechanism above only describes the growth of the avalanche. An initial energetic electron is needed to start the process. In ambient air, such energetic electrons typically come from [[cosmic rays]].&lt;ref name="Carlson2008" /&gt; In very strong electric fields, stronger than the maximum frictional force experienced by electrons, even low-energy ("cold" or "thermal") electrons can accelerate to relativistic energies, a process dubbed "thermal runaway."&lt;ref name="Colman2010" /&gt;

==Feedback==
RREA avalanches generally move opposite the direction of the electric field. As such, after the avalanches leave the electric field region, frictional forces dominate, the electrons lose energy, and the process stops. There is the possibility, however, that photons or positrons produced by the avalanche will wander back to where the avalanche began and can produce new seeds for a second generation of avalanches. If the electric field region is large enough, the number of second-generation avalanches will exceed the number of first-generation avalanches and the number of avalanches itself grows exponentially. This avalanche of avalanches can produce extremely large populations of energetic electrons. This process eventually leads to the decay of the electric field below the level at which feedback is possible and therefore acts as a limit to the large-scale electric field strength.&lt;ref name="Dwyer2003" /&gt;

==Effects of RREA==
The large population of energetic electrons produced in RREA will produce a correspondingly large population of energetic photons by [[bremsstrahlung]]. These photons are proposed as the source of [[terrestrial gamma-ray flashes]]. Large RREA events in thunderstorms may also contribute rare but large radiation doses to commercial airline flights.&lt;ref name="Dwyer2008" /&gt; The American physicist [[Joseph Dwyer]] coined the term "[[dark lightning]]" for this phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://current.com/technology/94014280_sciencecasts-dark-lightning.htm|title=Dark Lightning|publisher=[[Current TV]]|accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is still the subject of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/thunderstorms-contain-dark-lightning-invisible-pulses-of-powerful-radiation/2013/04/08/1c796ebc-8a76-11e2-a051-6810d606108d_story.html|title=Thunderstorms contain ‘dark lightning,’ invisible pulses of powerful radiation|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=April 9, 2012|first=Ivan|last=Amato}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roger Andrew Caras''' (May 24, 1928 – February 18, 2001) was an American wildlife photographer, writer, wildlife preservationist and television personality.

Known as the host of the annual [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]], Caras was the author of more than 70 books, a veteran of network television programs including ''[[Nightline]]'', ''[[ABC World News|ABC World News Tonight]]'' and ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' before devoting himself to work as president of the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===

Born May 24, 1928, in the rural town of [[Methuen, Massachusetts]], Caras was raised in a family that encouraged love of animals. His parents allowed him to foster a menagerie of pets, and during the Depression he went to work at the age of 10 to help pay for his pets' upkeep. His first job, working in the stables of an SPCA shelter, was his first experience with animal rescue in the shelter's haven for abused horses. He completed his education at Boston's Huntington Preparatory School and immediately enlisted in the U.S. Army near the end of [[World War II]].

Caras returned to Boston after his tour of duty and then enrolled as a [[zoology]] major at [[Northwestern University]]. In 1950, he transferred to [[Case Western Reserve University]], Cleveland, Ohio, but interrupted his education for military service again, this time in the [[Korean War]] from 1950 to 1952.

=== Career ===

Caras returned to civilian life as a West Coast resident, attending the [[University of Southern California]], where he earned a degree, not in zoology but in cinema, and stepped from academic life to executive-level work in the motion picture industry. During 15 years in the film world, Caras held a number of assignments, including serving as press secretary for actress [[Joan Crawford]], and from 1965 to 1969 as vice president of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s production company, [[Hawk Films]], working with Kubrick and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] on the science fiction epic ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=George A. |last1=Cevasco |first2=Richard P. |last2=Harmond |first3=Everett |last3=Mendelsohn |title=Modern American Environmentalists: A Biographical Encyclopedia |publisher=JHU Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8018-9152-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his Hollywood years, Caras also launched his writing career, contributing articles on animal and environmental issues to such periodicals as "Audubon" and publishing his first book, "Antarctica: Land of Frozen Time,” in 1962.

In 1964, Caras made his broadcasting debut on the NBC News program ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', spending nearly a decade as the program's "house naturalist." His skills in broadcasting, research, biology, and zoology led to his acceptance as one of the media's best-regarded animal authorities. He was sought out by the Walt Disney conglomerate as a consultant on their Florida [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom park]].

Acting as a special correspondent, Caras reported from around the globe on a variety of animal and environmental issues that ranged from exposes on laboratory animals to the plight of the endangered Giant Panda in China and to investigation of the black market commerce in exotic animals and poaching.

Caras spent from 1975 to 1992 as a regularly featured reporter on ABC Evening News (later World News Tonight with Peter Jennings,) as well as contributing to ''Nightline'', ''20/20'', and ''[[Good Morning America]]''. He also hosted radio programs, including ''Pets and Wildlife'' on CBS, ''Report from the World of Animals'' on NBC, and the ABC series ''The Living World''.

Caras won an Emmy Award for his reporting. His books include ''The Bond'' and his last book, ''Going for the Blue: Inside the World of Show Dogs and Dog Shows,'' which was published in time for the 2001 Westminster competition.

Caras’s work with and on behalf of animals led to his 1991 election as the 14th president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the oldest humane-treatment-of-animals organization in the United States. During his tenure, the ASPCA expanded its care, protection and education programs, and adopted a number of internal practices to improve its work. Caras retired in 1999 and became president emeritus, acting as a consultant and public speaker for the organization.

=== Death and afterward ===

Caras made his home in Freeland, [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], where he and his wife, Jill Langdon Barclay, maintained a farm that became home for a variety of animals. In 2001, in the last year of his life, Caras shared his farm with 12 dogs (7 Greyhounds, 3 retrievers and 2 hounds), nine cats, all of mixed origin, five horses, two cows, a pair of alpacas and a llama. After his death, his wife, his son, Dr. Barclay Caras, and daughter, Pamela Caras, requested that people wishing to honor his memory donate memorial contributions to the ASPCA in his name.

'''Salalah''' ({{lang-ar|صلالة}} [[Arabic transliteration|transliterated]] ''Ṣalālah''), is the capital and largest city of the southern [[Oman]]i [[Governorates of Oman|governorate]] of [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar]]. Its population in 2009 was about 197,169.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1116712886&amp;men=gpro&amp;lng=en&amp;gln=xx&amp;dat=32&amp;geo=-166&amp;srt=npan&amp;col=aohdq&amp;pt=c&amp;va=&amp;geo=385295409 |title=World Gazetteer: Şalālah – profile of geographical entity including name variants |publisher=Archive.is |date= |accessdate=22 November 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121208182326/http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1116712886&amp;men=gpro&amp;lng=en&amp;gln=xx&amp;dat=32&amp;geo=-166&amp;srt=npan&amp;col=aohdq&amp;pt=c&amp;va=&amp;geo=385295409 |archivedate=8 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salalah is the second-largest city in the [[Sultanate of Oman]], and the largest city in the Dhofar Province. Salalah is the birthplace of the current [[Sultans of Oman|sultan]], [[Qaboos of Oman|Qaboos bin Said]]. Salalah attracts many people from other parts of Oman and the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf region]] during the [[monsoon]]/[[Khareef|''khareef'']] season, which spans from July to September.
The [[climate]] of the region and the [[monsoon]] allows the city to grow some vegetables and fruits like coconut and bananas. There are many gardens within the city where these vegetables and fruits grow.

==History==
Salalah was the traditional capital of [[Dhofar]], which reached the peak  of prosperity in the 13th century thanks to the [[incense]] trade. Later it decayed, and in the 19th century it was absorbed by the Sultanate of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]]. Between 1932 and 1970, Salalah was the capital of the [[Sultanate of Muscat and Oman]] under [[Said ibn Taymur|Said bin Taimur]]. After the latter's death, his son [[Qaboos]] decided to move the capital of Oman to Muscat.

The Sultan traditionally lives in Salalah rather than in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], the [[capital (political)|capital]] and largest city in Oman; [[Qaboos of Oman|Qaboos]] has bucked this trend, and has lived in Muscat since he ascended to the throne in 1970. He does, however, visit Salalah fairly regularly to meet with influential [[tribe|tribal]] and local leaders; his last visit was in 2010 and before that he visited in 2006.

In 2010, during the 40th anniversary of Sultan Qaboos' taking the throne, he decided to spend his time in Salalah. The 40th anniversary celebrations consisted of a massive parade.  It lasted several hours and had an estimated 100,000 attendees.
In 2011 the city hosted peaceful protests after the [[domino effect]] from the [[Arab Spring]] which lasted several months.  Of the many requests filed from the protesters, some included  the expulsion of the current ministers, job opportunities, salary increases, a solution to the increasing cost of living, and the establishment of [[Islamic banking|Islamic banks]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Climate==
The city has a hot [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), although summers are cooler than in more northern or inland parts of Oman. Salalah is very cloudy during the [[monsoon]] months of July and August, even though relatively little rain falls. [[Khareef]] means "autumn" in Arabic but it refers to monsoon when describing the region around Salalah. During this time, the brown landscape of Salalah and its surroundings is completely transformed to a beautiful and lush greenery. 

[[Cyclone Mekunu]], which originated over the Arabian Sea, became an extremely severe cyclone before hitting the Salalah city on 25&amp;nbsp;May 2018. 200 kmph was the recorded windspeed and the city of Salalah was pounded with over 617 mm of rainfall, which is almost 5 years of Oman's average rainfall.

==Demographics==

===Religion===
The city, like many other in Arab states of the [[Arabian peninsula]], has a relatively large [[expatriate]] community, mainly from [[India]], [[Pakistan]],  [[Bangladesh]] and [[Philippines]].

The majority of the Omani population in Salalah is [[Muslim]].  {{cn-span|Like the majority of the [[Middle East]], most people in Salalah follow the [[Sunni]] [[Shafi]] sect of [[Islam]]; unlike the majority of Omanis in Muscat which mostly follow the [[Ibadhi]] sect.|date=April 2017}}  There is also a considerable population of [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] in the expatriate community.

===Language===
[[Arabic]] is the official language and the most spoken one. The unofficial, unwritten language known as [[Shehri language|Jeballi]] is the second most spoken language and the [[mother tongue]] of many in Salalah and its surrounding areas, with 25,000 estimated speakers as of 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=shv |title=Shehri |publisher=Ethnologue |date=19 February 1999 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English is the official foreign language and the most spoken language of the [[expatriate|expats]]. [[Malayalam]] is another popular language and together with [[Tamil language|Tamil]], Telugu, [[Hindustani language|Hindi/Urdu]] it is the most widely spoken language among expatriates.

==Economy==
[[APM Terminals]], part of the [[A. P. Moller-Maersk Group]] of Denmark, manages the [[Port of Salalah]]; one of the largest ports on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] which is an important transshipment hub for container shipping in the area.  The [[Port of Salalah]] is also one of the most vital ports on the peninsula connecting together [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Asia]]. But the port is outside the city, to the south. It is also the largest private employer in the [[Dhofar]] region. The Salalah Free Zone, situated right beside the port, is emerging as a new center for heavy industries in the Middle East.

==Tourist attractions==
[[File:Wadi Darbat.jpg|thumb|Wadi Darbat, Salalah]]
Salalah's economy is also based on Tourism. During [[Khareef]] season (July to Sept), there are many tourists visit from [[Middle East]]. There are many places to visit in Salalah during this season as the '''mountains turns green''' and the ''rain causes many waterfalls in the mountains'' mainly Wadi Darbat, Ain Athum, Ain Tubrook, and Ain Khor. 

There are four prophet tombs located here: Nabi Imran, Nabi Ayoob, Nabi Houd, and Nabi Salih&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beautifulsalalah.com/salalah-waterfalls-in-khareef/|title=Visit Beautiful Waterfalls in Salalah during Khareef - Beautiful Salalah|date=22 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The city received more than 600,000 tourists during khareef season in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofoman.com/article/116710/Oman/Tourism/Oman-tourism-More-than-600000-visit-Khareef-Salalah-Festival-in-Dhofar|title=Oman tourism: Khareef Salalah visitor numbers cross 600,000 mark|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
[[File:Oman vs KSA Al Saada Stadium August142009 Salalah4life.jpg|thumb|alt=Al-Saada Stadium|Al-Saada Stadium.]]
Salalah is known as the home of some of the best football clubs in Oman. In total, Salalah has 4 [[sport club]]s based in the city: [[Salalah Club Salalah|Salalah Club]], [[Al-Ittihad Salalah|Al-Ittihad]], [[Al Nasr Salalah|Al-Nasr]], and [[Dhofar (football club)|Dhofar]].

[[Dhofar (football club)|Dhofar F.C.]] have been nicknamed as "''Al-Zaeem''", or "The Leaders", due to their enormous success in both the [[Omani League]], and in the [[Sultan Qaboos Cup]].  Dhofar have also have an adequate number of trophies in sports like [[volleyball]], and [[team handball|handball]].  [[Al Nasr Salalah|Al-Nasr]] have also been known for their great success in [[football (soccer)|football]], winning the Omani League 5 times, and the Sultan Qaboos Cup 4 times.

The newer, [[Al Saada Sports Complex|Al-Saadah Stadium]] is the newly built stadium in Al-Saada district of Salalah devoted to football.  Incorporated in the walls of the sports complex apart from the football stadium is a hockey field, [[tennis court]], [[olympic swimming pool]], and indoor volleyball/basketball court.  Al-Saada Stadium is the venue where [[Saudi arabia national football team|Saudi national football team]], and the [[Oman national football team|Omani national team]] first met in Salalah on August 12, 2009.

The most popular sport played among the youth is by far football.  It is very normal to see a group of boys and young men from around the area playing in makeshift fields in parking lots, or in a large open area.  Beach football is also a common sight to see along the beach in the Al-Haffa district.  Another popular sport in Salalah is volleyball.  Although not as popular as football the game is frequently played.

==Education==
Currently Salalah has two colleges, the Salalah College of Technology and Salalah College of Applied Science, both of which are government owned and sponsored.

The Salalah College of Applied Sciences incorporates an English Department. Its aim is to offer students a solid grasp of the English language so that they may go on to complete further studies in important sectors such as I.T. and Communication and Design.

Recently the university has constructed a new campus worth 25 million [[Omani Rial|OR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://du.edu.om/News/pages/Dhofar_University_construction.html |title=Dhofar University campus construction contracts reach RO 25 million |publisher=Du.edu.om |date= |accessdate=22 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016002755/http://du.edu.om/News/pages/Dhofar_University_construction.html |archivedate=16 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air transport===
''For the main article see: [[Salalah International Airport]]''

[[Salalah International Airport]] mainly caters to domestic flights from Muscat and some International flights from [[India]] and regional Arab countries such as [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates|U.A.E]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Oman Air]], the national airline operates 5 flights daily from Salalah to [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], the capital city and also 2 flights to [[Dubai]] weekly. Oman Air introduced Oman Air Pass for regular travelers between Salalah and Muscat. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.omanair.com/en/about-us/press-releases/oman-air-introduces-new-oman-air-pass|title=Oman Air Introduces The New Oman Air Pass|date=30 November 2016|publisher=[[Oman Air]]|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qatar Airways]] has four flights a week from Salalah to Doha connecting to over 130 destinations worldwide since May 2013.  Very convenient connections are available to destinations in Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australia.  There is also a direct weekly flight from and to [[Kochi]], [[Kozhikode]] (Calicut) &amp; [[Thiruvananthapuram]] operated by [[Air India Express]] for the [[Malayalee]] expatriates. During the Khareef Season (Monsoons) there are weekly flights to other international destinations including [[Sweden]] and [[Turkey]]. There are also transit flights to almost all countries. The new International airport opened in November 2014 and the old Airport has since then been converted into a Domestic and emergency Airport.

===Public transport===
Salalah does not have a public transportation system within the city limits. However long distance air-conditioned buses are operated daily from Salalah to [[Haima, Oman|Haima]], Muscat, [[Nizwa]], [[Buraimi|Al-Buraimi]], [[Dubai]], [[Al-Ain]], [[Al Ghaydah|Al-Ghaydah]], [[Mukalla]], and [[Seiyun]], as well as [[Petroleum Development Oman|PDO]] locations such as Marmul.

Other forms of other public transport popular in Salalah are taxis.  Generally fares vary from half a Rial to 2 Rials depending on the distance to destination.  Taxis are color-coded orange and white and provide semi-personal transportation in the form of both individual hire and the same opportunistic roadway service as Baisa buses, which are not as popular in the city.

Baisa buses, also colour-coded orange and white, and like taxis are unmetered after several government initiatives to introduce meters were rejected. The fare is set by way of negotiation, although drivers usually adhere to certain unwritten rules for fares within the city. One should always find out the normally accepted fare for one's journey from one's hotel or host before looking for a taxi.

===Water transport===
''For the main article see : [[Port of Salalah]]''

[[Port of Salalah]] is one of the deepwater ports in Oman and also 11th busiest transshipment port in the world, second busiest port in middle east, which is located at Port Raysut(Salalah). It can accommodate large vessels up to 18m draft. It is the main Container Tran-shipment Terminal of the region.
This port is operated and managed by Salalah Port Services Company (S.A.O.G.). The port also welcomes cruise liners &amp; luxury ships.

==Media==
The English language radio stations are Hi FM and Merge, which are the only English language stations in Oman. There are also a number of Arabic radio channels. In Salalah almost all TV channels are available. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

'''Satellite television''' is a service that delivers television programming to viewers by relaying it from a [[communications satellite]] orbiting the Earth directly to the viewer's location.&lt;ref&gt;ITU Radio Regulations, Section IV. Radio Stations and Systems – Article 1.39, definition: ''Broadcasting-satellite service''&lt;/ref&gt;  The signals are received via an outdoor [[parabolic antenna]] commonly referred to as a [[satellite dish]] and a [[low-noise block downconverter]].

A satellite receiver then decodes the desired [[television programme]] for viewing on a [[television set]]. Receivers can be external [[set-top box]]es, or a built-in [[tuner (television)|television tuner]]. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services. It is usually the only television available in many remote geographic areas without [[terrestrial television]] or [[cable television]] service.

Modern systems signals are relayed from a [[direct broadcast satellite|communications satellite]] on the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] frequencies (12–18&amp;nbsp;GHz) requiring only a small dish less than a meter in diameter.&lt;ref name="m101" /&gt;  The first satellite TV systems were an obsolete type now known as [[television receive-only]]. These systems received weaker analog signals transmitted in the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] (4–8&amp;nbsp;GHz) from [[Fixed Service Satellite|FSS]] type satellites, requiring the use of large 2–3-meter dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed "big dish" systems, and were more expensive and less popular.&lt;ref name="fcc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Installing Consumer-Owned Antennas and Satellite Dishes|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/consumerdish.html|publisher=FCC|accessdate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early systems used [[analog signal]]s, but modern ones use [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|digital signals]] which allow transmission of the modern television standard [[high-definition television]], due to the significantly improved [[spectral efficiency]] of digital broadcasting. As of 2018, [[Star One C2]] from Brazil is the only remaining satellite broadcasting in analog signals, as well as one channel ([[C-SPAN]]) on [[AMC-11]] from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sathint.com/search?custom=analog&lt;/ref&gt;

Different receivers are required for the two types. Some transmissions and channels are unencrypted and therefore [[free-to-air]] or [[free-to-view]], while many other channels are transmitted with encryption ([[pay television]]), requiring the viewer to subscribe and pay a monthly fee to receive the programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell|first=Dennis|last2=Cotter|first2=Susan|year=1998|title=Copyright Infringement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRJCwqzE3iwC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=satellite+tv+free+to+air+free+to+view+must+pay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4lkbVObmJsvLggTq8IEY&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=satellite%20tv%20free%20to%20air%20free%20to%20view%20must%20pay&amp;f=false|location=|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=90-247-3002-3|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellites used for broadcasting television are usually in a [[geostationary orbit]] {{convert|37,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the earth's [[equator]].  The advantage of this orbit is that the satellite's orbital period equals the rotation rate of the Earth, so the satellite appears at a fixed position in the sky.  Thus the satellite dish antenna which receives the signal can be aimed permanently at the location of the satellite, and does not have to track a moving satellite.  A few systems instead use a highly elliptical orbit with [[inclination]] of +/−63.4 degrees and orbital period of about twelve hours, known as a [[Molniya orbit]].

Satellite television, like other communications relayed by satellite, starts with a transmitting antenna located at an [[uplink]] facility.{{sfn|Pattan|1993|p=207}} Uplink satellite dishes are very large, as much as 9 to 12 meters (30 to 40 feet) in diameter.{{sfn|Pattan|1993|p=207}} The increased diameter results in more accurate aiming and increased signal strength at the satellite.{{sfn|Pattan|1993|p=207}} The uplink dish is pointed toward a specific satellite and the uplinked signals are transmitted within a specific frequency range, so as to be received by one of the [[transponder]]s tuned to that frequency range aboard that satellite.{{sfn|Pattan|1993|p=330}} The transponder re-transmits the signals back to Earth at a different frequency (a process known as translation, used to avoid interference with the uplink signal), typically in the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] (4–8&amp;nbsp;GHz), [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band]] (12–18&amp;nbsp;GHz), or both.{{sfn|Pattan|1993|p=207}} The leg of the signal path from the satellite to the receiving Earth station is called the downlink.{{sfn|Pattan|1993|p=327}}

A typical satellite has up to 32 K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band or 24 C-band transponders, or more for K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;/C hybrid satellites.{{sfn|Mott, Sheldon|2000|p=253}} Typical transponders each have a bandwidth between 27 and 50&amp;nbsp;MHz.{{sfn|Mott, Sheldon|2000|p=253}} Each geostationary C-band satellite needs to be spaced 2° longitude from the next satellite to avoid interference; for K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; the spacing can be 1°.{{sfn|Mott, Sheldon|2000|p=268}} This means that there is an upper limit of 360/2 = 180 geostationary C-band satellites or 360/1 = 360 geostationary K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band satellites.{{sfn|Mott, Sheldon|2000|p=268}} C-band transmission is susceptible to terrestrial interference while K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band transmission is affected by [[Rain fade|rain]] (as water is an excellent absorber of microwaves at this particular frequency).{{sfn|Mott, Sheldon|2000|p=115}} The latter is even more adversely affected by ice crystals in thunder clouds.{{sfn|Mott, Sheldon|2000|p=115}}

On occasion, [[sun outage]] will occur when the sun lines up directly behind the geostationary satellite to which the receiving antenna is pointed.{{sfn|Tirro|1993|p=279}}
The downlink satellite signal, quite weak after traveling the great distance (see [[inverse-square law]]), is collected with a [[parabolic reflector|parabolic]] receiving dish, which reflects the weak signal to the dish's focal point.{{sfn|Minoli|2009|p=60}} Mounted on brackets at the dish's focal point is a device called a [[feedhorn]] or collector.{{sfn|Minoli|2009|p=27}} The feedhorn is a section of [[waveguide]] with a flared front-end that gathers the signals at or near the focal point and conducts them to a probe or pickup connected to a [[Low-noise block converter|low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB).{{sfn|Minoli|2009|p=194}} The LNB amplifies the signals and [[Downconverter|downconverts]] them to a lower block of [[intermediate frequency|intermediate frequencies]] (IF), usually in the [[L band|L-band]].{{sfn|Minoli|2009|p=194}}

The original C-band satellite television systems used a [[low-noise amplifier]] (LNA) connected to the feedhorn at the focal point of the dish.&lt;ref name="ewww"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|year=1985|title=Europe's Best Kept Secret|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDFWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=low-noise+amplifier+connected+to+the+feedhorn+at+the+focal+point+of+the+dish+c-band&amp;dq=low-noise+amplifier+connected+to+the+feedhorn+at+the+focal+point+of+the+dish+c-band&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XhLZU6aaE-rgsAS41oHICA&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA|journal=Electronics World + Wireless World|publisher=Reed Business Publishing|volume=95|issue=|pages=60–62|doi=|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amplified signal, still at the higher microwave frequencies, had to be fed via very expensive low-loss 50-ohm impedance [[Coaxial cable#Hard line|gas filled hardline]] [[coaxial cable]] with relatively complex [[N connector|N-connectors]] to an indoor receiver or, in other designs, a downconverter (a mixer and a voltage-tuned oscillator with some filter circuitry) for downconversion to an intermediate frequency.&lt;ref name="ewww"/&gt; The channel selection was controlled typically by a voltage tuned oscillator with the tuning voltage being fed via a separate cable to the headend, but this design evolved.&lt;ref name="ewww"/&gt;

Designs for [[microstrip]]-based converters for [[amateur radio]] frequencies were adapted for the 4&amp;nbsp;GHz C-band.&lt;ref name="hrmz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|year=1984|title=Microstrip Impedance Program|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ztQAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=microstrip+amateur+radio+c-band&amp;dq=microstrip+amateur+radio+c-band&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LxTZU7jEJ9PhsAS76ICwBw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA|journal=Ham Radio Magazine|publisher=Communications Technology, Incorporated|volume=17|issue=|pages=84|doi=|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to these designs was concept of block downconversion of a range of frequencies to a lower, more easily handled IF.&lt;ref name="hrmz"/&gt;

The advantages of using an LNB are that cheaper cable can be used to connect the indoor receiver to the satellite television dish and LNB, and that the technology for handling the signal at L-band and UHF was far cheaper than that for handling the signal at C-band frequencies.&lt;ref name="mji"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|year=2000|title=Microwave Journal International|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=sOLXU9rDHeTgsATVz4KgCg&amp;id=X0pKAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=lnb+70+ohm+satellite+75+ohm&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=lnb+70+ohm+satellite+75+ohm|journal=[[Microwave Journal International]]|publisher=[[Horizon House]]|volume=43|issue=10-12|pages=26–28|doi=|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to cheaper technology from the hardline and N-connectors of the early C-band systems to the cheaper and simpler 75-ohm cable and [[F connector|F-connectors]] allowed the early satellite television receivers to use, what were in reality, modified [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] television tuners which selected the satellite television channel for down conversion to a lower [[intermediate frequency]] centered on 70&amp;nbsp;MHz, where it was demodulated.&lt;ref name="mji"/&gt; This shift allowed the satellite television [[Direct To Home|DTH]] industry to change from being a largely hobbyist one where only small numbers of systems costing thousands of US dollars were built, to a far more commercial one of mass production.&lt;ref name="mji"/&gt;

In the United States, service providers use the [[intermediate frequency]] ranges of 950–2150&amp;nbsp;MHz to carry the signal from the LNBF at the dish down to the receiver. This allows for transmission of UHF signals along the same span of coaxial wire at the same time. In some applications ([[DirecTV]] AU9-S and AT-9), ranges of the lower [[B-band]]{{Ambiguous|reason=Exactly which frequencies? B-band is ambiguous|date=July 2016}} and 2250–3000&amp;nbsp;MHz, are used. Newer LNBFs in use by DirecTV, called SWM (Single Wire Multiswitch), are used to implement [[single cable distribution]] and use a wider frequency range of 2–2150&amp;nbsp;MHz.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The satellite receiver or [[set-top box]] demodulates and converts the signals to the desired form (outputs for television, audio, data, etc.).{{sfn|Dodd|2002|p=308}}  Often, the receiver includes the capability to selectively [[scrambler|unscramble]] or [[encryption|decrypt]] the received signal to provide premium services to some subscribers; the receiver is then called an [[integrated receiver/decoder]] or IRD.{{sfn|Dodd|2002|p=72}} Low-loss cable (e.g. [[RG-6]], [[RG-11]], etc.) is used to connect the receiver to the LNBF or LNB.{{sfn|Minoli|2009|p=194}} [[RG-59]] is not recommended for this application as it is not technically designed to carry frequencies above 950&amp;nbsp;MHz, but may work in some circumstances, depending on the quality of the coaxial wire, signal levels, cable length, etc.{{sfn|Minoli|2009|p=194}}

A practical problem relating to home satellite reception is that an LNB can basically only handle a single receiver.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Barry|last2=|first2=|year=1995|title=Leaky dishes drown out terrestrial TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lz4eAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=LNB+can+only+handle+a+single+receiver+problem&amp;dq=LNB+can+only+handle+a+single+receiver+problem&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pjTZU5-RJfjKsQTi6oHgDA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA|journal=[[New Scientist]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|volume=145|issue=|pages=19–22|doi=|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the LNB is translating two different [[circular polarization]]s (right-hand and left-hand) and, in the case of K-band, two different frequency bands (lower and upper) to the same frequency range on the cable.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt; Depending on which frequency and polarization a transponder is using, the satellite receiver has to switch the LNB into one of four different modes in order to receive a specific "channel".&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt; This is handled by the receiver using the [[DiSEqC]] protocol to control the LNB mode.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt; If several satellite receivers are to be attached to a single dish, a so-called [[multiswitch]] will have to be used in conjunction with a special type of LNB.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt; There are also LNBs available with a multiswitch already integrated.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt; This problem becomes more complicated when several receivers are to use several dishes (or several LNBs mounted in a single dish) pointing to different satellites.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt;

A common solution for consumers wanting to access multiple satellites is to deploy a single dish with a single LNB and to rotate the dish using an electric motor. The axis of rotation has to be set up in the north-south direction and, depending on the geographical location of the dish, have a specific vertical tilt. Set up properly the motorized dish when turned will sweep across all possible positions for satellites lined up along the [[geostationary orbit]] directly above the equator. The disk will then be capable of receiving any geostationary satellite that is visible at the specific location, i.e. that is above the horizon. The [[DiSEqC]] protocol has been extended to encompass commands for steering dish rotors.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

There are five major components in a satellite system: the programming source, the broadcast center, the satellite, the [[satellite dish]], and the [[Set-top box|receiver]]. "Direct broadcast" satellites used for transmission of satellite television signals are generally in [[geostationary orbit]] {{convert|37,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the earth's [[equator]].&lt;ref name="sspt"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GJWEro9ea4C&amp;dq=sun+outage+satellite&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Satellite Systems:Principles and Technologies|last=Pattan|first=Bruno|date=31 March 1993|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780442013578|location=Berlin|page=|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason for using this orbit is that the satellite circles the Earth at the same rate as the Earth rotates, so the satellite appears at a fixed point in the sky.  Thus satellite dishes can be aimed permanently at that point, and don't need a tracking system to turn to follow a moving satellite.  A few satellite TV systems use satellites in a [[Molniya orbit]], a highly [[Elliptical orbit|elliptical]] orbit with [[inclination]] of +/-63.4 degrees and orbital period of about twelve hours.

Satellite television, like other communications relayed by satellite, starts with a transmitting antenna located at an [[uplink]] facility.&lt;ref name="sspt" /&gt; Uplink facilities transmit the signal to the satellite over a narrow beam of [[microwave]]s, typically in the [[C band (NATO)|C-band]] frequency range due to its resistance to [[rain fade]].&lt;ref name="sspt" /&gt; Uplink satellite dishes are very large, often as much as 9 to 12 metres (30 to 40 feet) in diameter&lt;ref name="sspt" /&gt; to achieve accurate aiming and increased signal strength at the satellite, to improve reliability.&lt;ref name="sspt" /&gt; The uplink dish is pointed toward a specific satellite and the uplinked signals are transmitted within a specific frequency range, so as to be received by one of the [[transponder]]s tuned to that frequency range aboard that satellite.&lt;ref name="sspt" /&gt; The transponder then converts the signals to [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]], a process known as "translation," and transmits them back to earth to be received by home satellite stations.&lt;ref name="sspt" /&gt;

The downlinked satellite signal, weaker after traveling the great distance (see [[inverse-square law]]), is collected by using a rooftop [[Parabolic antenna|parabolic]] receiving dish ("[[satellite dish]]"), which reflects the weak signal to the dish's focal point.&lt;ref name="sseipv6"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yJi1UQDPp8C&amp;dq=feedhorn+satellite+system&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Satellite Systems Engineering in an IPv6 Environment|last=Minoli|first=Daniel|date=3 February 2009|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=978-1420078688|location=[[Boca Raton, Florida]]|page=|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mounted on brackets at the dish's [[Focus (optics)|focal point]] is a [[feedhorn]]&lt;ref name="sseipv6" /&gt; which passes the signals through a [[waveguide]] to a device called a [[low-noise block converter]] (LNB) or low noise converter (LNC) attached to the horn.&lt;ref name="sseipv6" /&gt; The LNB amplifies the weak signals, filters the block of frequencies in which the satellite television signals are transmitted, and converts the block of frequencies to a lower frequency range in the [[L-band]] range.&lt;ref name="sseipv6" /&gt;  The signal is then passed through a [[coaxial cable]] into the residence to the satellite television receiver, a [[set-top box]] next to the television.

The reason for using the LNB to do the frequency translation at the dish is so that the signal can be carried into the residence using cheap [[coaxial cable]].  To transport the signal into the house at its original K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band [[microwave]] frequency would require an expensive [[waveguide]], a metal pipe to carry the radio waves.&lt;ref name="mji2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|year=2000|title=Microwave Journal International|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=sOLXU9rDHeTgsATVz4KgCg&amp;id=X0pKAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=lnb+70+ohm+satellite+75+ohm&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=lnb+70+ohm+satellite+75+ohm|journal=[[Microwave Journal International]]|publisher=[[Horizon House]]|volume=43|issue=10–12|pages=26–28|doi=|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cable connecting the receiver to the LNB are of the low loss type [[RG-6]], quad shield RG-6, or RG-11.&lt;ref name="egt"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4POZ66FaS0C&amp;pg=PA308&amp;dq=set-top+box+converts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kuXXU-7uIoO_sQSC6YD4Cg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=set-top%20box%20converts&amp;f=false|title=The Essential Guide to Telecommunications|last=Dodd|first=Annabel Z.|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|year=2002|isbn=0130649074|edition=5th|location=[[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey]]|pages=307–10|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RG-59]] is not recommended for this application as it is not technically designed to carry frequencies above 950&amp;nbsp;MHz, but will work in many circumstances, depending on the quality of the coaxial wire.&lt;ref name="egt" /&gt;  The shift to more affordable technology from the 50{{nbsp}}ohm impedance cable and [[N connector|N-connector]]s of the early C-band systems to the cheaper 75{{nbsp}}ohm technology and [[F connector|F-connector]]s allowed the early satellite television receivers to use, what were in reality, modified [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] television tuners which selected the satellite television channel for down conversion to another lower [[intermediate frequency]] centered on 70&amp;nbsp;MHz where it was demodulated.&lt;ref name="mji2" /&gt;

An LNB can only handle a single receiver.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt; This is due to the fact that the LNB is mapping two different circular polarisations – right hand and left hand – and in the case of the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band two different reception bands – lower and upper – to one and the same frequency band on the cable, and is a practical problem for home satellite reception.&lt;ref name="newscientist2" /&gt; Depending on which frequency a transponder is transmitting at and on what polarisation it is using, the satellite receiver has to switch the LNB into one of four different modes in order to receive a specific desired program on a specific transponder.&lt;ref name="newscientist2" /&gt; The receiver uses the [[DiSEqC]] protocol to control the LNB mode, which handles this.&lt;ref name="newscientist2" /&gt; If several satellite receivers are to be attached to a single dish a so-called [[multiswitch]] must be used in conjunction with a special type of LNB.&lt;ref name="newscientist2" /&gt; There are also LNBs available with a multiswitch already integrated.&lt;ref name="newscientist2" /&gt; This problem becomes more complicated when several receivers use several dishes or several LNBs mounted in a single dish are aimed at different satellites.&lt;ref name="newscientist2" /&gt;

The [[set-top box]] selects the channel desired by the user by filtering that channel from the multiple channels received from the satellite, converts the signal to a lower [[intermediate frequency]], [[Decryption|decrypts]] the [[Encryption|encrypted]] signal,  [[Demodulation|demodulates]] the radio signal and sends the resulting video signal to the television through a cable.&lt;ref name="egt" /&gt;  To decrypt the signal the receiver box must be "activated" by the satellite company.  If the customer fails to pay his monthly bill the box is "deactivated" by a signal from the company, and the system will not work until the company reactivates it.  Some receivers are capable of [[Encryption|decrypting]] the received signal itself. These receivers are called [[integrated receiver/decoder]]s or IRDs.&lt;ref name="egt" /&gt;

Analog television which was distributed via satellite was usually sent scrambled or unscrambled in [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], or [[SECAM]] television broadcast standards. The analog signal is [[frequency modulated]] and is converted from an FM signal to what is referred to as [[baseband]]. This baseband comprises the video signal and the audio subcarrier(s). The audio subcarrier is further demodulated to provide a raw audio signal.

Later signals were digitized television signal or multiplex of signals, typically [[Phase-shift keying|QPSK]]. In general, digital television, including that transmitted via satellites, is based on open standards such as [[MPEG-2|MPEG]] and [[DVB-S]]/[[DVB-S2]] or [[ISDB-S]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The [[conditional access]] encryption/scrambling methods include [[NDS Group|NDS]], [[BISS]], [[Conax]], [[Digicipher]], Irdeto, [[Cryptoworks]], [[DG Crypt]], [[Beta digital]], [[SECA Mediaguard]], [[Logiways]], [[Nagravision]], [[PowerVu]], [[Viaccess]], [[Videocipher]], and [[VideoGuard]]. Many conditional access systems have been compromised.

=== Sun outage ===
An event called [[sun outage]] occurs when the sun lines up directly behind the satellite in the field of view of the receiving satellite dish.&lt;ref name="scsd"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AdwFdgykaMUC&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=sun+outage+satellite&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yNrXU6HVILfMsQTLvoDYCw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sun%20outage%20satellite&amp;f=false|title=Satellite Communication Systems Design|last=Tirró|first=S.|date=30 June 1993|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0306441479|location=[[Berlin]]|pages=279–80|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens for about a 10-minute period daily around midday, twice every year for a two-week period in the spring and fall around the [[equinox]].  During this period, the sun is within the [[main lobe]] of the dish's reception pattern, so the strong microwave [[Radio noise|noise]] emitted by the sun on the same frequencies used by the satellite's transponders drowns out reception.&lt;ref name="scsd" /&gt;

Most systems use the [[DVB-S]] standard for transmission.&lt;ref name="tr101198"&gt;{{Cite report|author=Antipolis, Sophia|date=September 1997|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation in DVB satellite transmission systems|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101100_101199/101198/01.01.01_60/tr_101198v010101p.pdf|publisher=[[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]|pages=1–7|docket=TR 101 198|accessdate=20 July 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[pay television]] services, the datastream is encrypted and requires proprietary reception equipment. While the underlying reception technology is similar, the pay television technology is proprietary, often consisting of a [[conditional-access module]] and [[smart card]]. This measure assures satellite television providers that only authorized, paying [[subscriber]]s have access to pay television content but at the same time can allow [[free-to-air]] channels to be viewed even by the people with standard equipment available in the market.

Some countries operate satellite television services which can be received for free, without paying a subscription fee.  This is called [[free-to-air]] satellite television. [[Germany]] is likely the leader in [[free-to-air]] with approximately 250 digital channels (including 83 [[High-definition television|HDTV]] channels and various regional channels) broadcast from the [[Astra 19.2°E]] satellite constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kabelfernsehen-kabelanschluss.de/artikel/satellitenfernsehen-in-deutschland|title=Satellitenfernsehen in Deutschland|language=German|trans-title=Satellite TV in Germany|accessdate=5 April 2016|work=kabelfernsehen-kabelanschluss.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are not marketed as a DBS service, but are received in approximately 18 million homes, as well as in any home using the ''[[Sky Deutschland]]'' commercial DBS system.

The [[United Kingdom]] has approximately 160 digital channels (including the regional variations of [[BBC]] channels, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] channels, [[Channel 4]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]) that are broadcast without encryption from the [[Astra 28.2°E]] satellite constellation, and receivable on any [[DVB-S]] receiver (a [[DVB-S2]] receiver is required for certain high definition television services). Most of these channels are included within the [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky]] [[EPG]], and an increasing number within the [[Freesat]] EPG.

[[India]]'s national broadcaster, [[Doordarshan]], promotes a free-to-air DBS package as "[[DD Free Dish]]", which is provided as in-fill for the country's terrestrial transmission network. It is broadcast from [[GSAT-15]] at 93.5°E and contains about 80 FTA channels.

While originally launched as [[Backhaul (TV industry)|backhaul]] for their [[digital terrestrial television]] service, a large number of French channels are free-to-air on satellites at 5°W, and have recently been announced as being official in-fill for the DTT network.

In North America (United States, [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]]) there are over 80 FTA digital channels available on [[Galaxy 19]] (with the majority being ethnic or religious in nature). Other FTA satellites include [[AMC-4]], [[AMC-6]], [[Galaxy 18]], and [[Satmex]] 5. A company called [[GloryStar]] promotes FTA religious broadcasters on [[Galaxy 19]].

===Television receive-only===
{{main article|Television receive-only}}
[[File:Satellite dish 1 C-Band.jpg|190px|thumbnail|left|A C-band satellite dish used by TVRO systems.]]
The term [[Television receive-only]], or TVRO, arose during the early days of satellite television reception to differentiate it from commercial satellite television uplink and downlink operations (transmit and receive). This was the primary method of satellite television transmissions before the satellite television industry shifted, with the launch of higher powered DBS satellites in the early 1990s which transmitted their signals on the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band frequencies.&lt;ref name=fcc/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;James, Meg.

Los Angeles Times, July 26, 2007. Retrieved on May 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite television channels at that time were intended to be used by [[cable television]] networks rather than received by home viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 1986|title=Satellite Communications Training from NRI!|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=113OPTBSLVkC&amp;dq=tvro&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|journal=Popular Science|volume=228|location=|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early satellite television receiver systems were largely constructed by hobbyists and engineers. These early TVRO systems operated mainly on the C-band frequencies and the dishes required were large; typically over 3 meters (10&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter.{{sfn|Prentiss|1989|p=274}} Consequently, TVRO is often referred to as "big dish" or "Big Ugly Dish" (BUD) satellite television.

TVRO systems were designed to receive analog and digital [[Communications satellite|satellite]] feeds of both television or audio from both C-band and K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band [[transponder]]s on [[Fixed Service Satellite|FSS]]-type satellites.{{sfn|Prentiss|1989|p=246}}{{sfn|Prentiss|1989|p=1}} The higher frequency K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band systems tend to resemble DBS systems and can use a smaller dish antenna because of the higher power transmissions and greater antenna gain. TVRO systems tend to use larger rather than smaller satellite dish antennas, since it is more likely that the owner of a TVRO system would have a C-band-only setup rather than a K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band-only setup. Additional receiver boxes allow for different types of digital satellite signal reception, such as DVB/MPEG-2 and [[4DTV]].

The narrow beam width of a normal parabolic satellite antenna means it can only receive signals from a single satellite at a time.{{sfn|Prentiss|1989|p=293}} [[Simulsat]] or the Vertex-RSI TORUS, is a quasi-parabolic satellite earthstation antenna that is capable of receiving satellite transmissions from 35 or more C- and K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band satellites simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=1 November 2009|title=Sensing SATCOM Success Is New Simulsat From ATCi|url=http://www.satnews.com/story.php?number=1617607397|newspaper=Satnews|location=|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of the satellite TV industry, 1976–1980===
The satellite television industry developed first in the US from the [[cable television]] industry as communication satellites were being used to distribute television programming to remote [[cable television headend]]s. [[HBO|Home Box Office]] (HBO), [[Turner Broadcasting System]] (TBS), and [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN, later [[Freeform (TV channel)|The Family Channel]]) were among the first to use satellite television to deliver programming. [[Taylor Howard]] of [[San Andreas, California|San Andreas]], [[California]] became the first person to receive C-band satellite signals with his home-built system in 1976.&lt;ref name="tayhoward"&gt;{{cite news|last=Feder|first=Barnaby J.|date=15 November 2002|title=Taylor Howard, 70, Pioneer In Satellite TV for the Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/15/business/taylor-howard-70-pioneer-in-satellite-tv-for-the-home.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|location=|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[PBS]], a non-profit public broadcasting service, began to distribute its television programming by satellite in 1978.&lt;ref name="pbs78"&gt;Public Service Broadcasting in the Age of Globalization, Editors: Indrajit Banerjee, Kalinga Seneviratne. {{ISBN|9789814136013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1979, Soviet engineers developed the Moskva (or [[Moscow]]) system of broadcasting and delivering of TV signals via satellites. They launched the [[Gorizont]] communication satellites later that same year. These satellites used [[geostationary orbit]]s.&lt;ref name="gorizont"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gorizont.htm|title=Gorizont|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=2008-06-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617211454/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gorizont.htm|archivedate=2008-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were equipped with powerful on-board transponders, so the size of receiving parabolic antennas of downlink stations was reduced to 4 and 2.5 metres.&lt;ref name="gorizont"/&gt; On October 18, 1979, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) began allowing people to have home satellite earth stations without a federal government license.&lt;ref name="dms"&gt;[http://www.dmsiusa.com/glory-days.html The "Glory Days" of Satellite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303133328/http://dmsiusa.com/glory-days.html |date=2014-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The front cover of the 1979 [[Neiman-Marcus]] Christmas catalogue featured the first home satellite TV stations on sale for $36,500.&lt;ref name="uspopcult"&gt;{{cite book|last=Browne|first=Ray|year=2001|title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;pg=PA706&amp;lpg=PA706&amp;dq=neiman+marcus+satellite+dish+1977&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oq7ha9CzGR&amp;sig=XvUPHAnEEqAcMHs-8LjuwMF2hEU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UkyzU-PxFLHNsQTr4oLIBg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=neiman%20marcus%20satellite%20dish%201979&amp;f=false|location=[[Madison, Wisconsin]]|publisher=Popular Press|page=706|isbn=9780879728212|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dishes were nearly {{convert|20|ft|m}} in diameter&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite news|last=Giarrusso|first=Michael|date=28 July 1996|title=Tiny Satellite Dishes Sprout in Rural Areas|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-28/news/mn-28792_1_small-dishes|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Los Angeles]]|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were remote controlled.&lt;ref name="denverpost"&gt;{{cite news|last=Keating|first=Stephen|year=1999|title=Stealing Free TV, Part 2|url=http://extras.denverpost.com/business/cutt1101.htm|newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]|location=[[Denver, CO]]|publisher=The Denver Post|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price went down by half soon after that, but there were only eight more channels.&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;{{cite news|title=Whatta dish : Home satellite reception a TV turn-on|last=Stein|first=Joe|work=[[San Diego Union-Tribune|Evening Tribune]]|date=1989-01-24|page=C-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society for Private and Commercial Earth Stations (SPACE), an organisation which represented consumers and satellite TV system owners, was established in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=21 December 1980|title=Earth Station Is Very Popular Dish|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19801221&amp;id=v_UhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XaIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3196,441027|newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]]|location=[[Kansas City, Missouri]]|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TVRO/C-band satellite era, 1980–1986===
{{further|Television receive-only}}
By 1980, satellite television was well established in the [[Satellite television in the United States|USA]] and Europe. On 26 April 1982, the first satellite channel in the UK, Satellite Television Ltd. (later [[Sky1]]), was launched.&lt;ref name=bbcable&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2eedi1l&amp;s=6 |title=Broadband Cable 10th Anniversary |publisher=TinyPic |date= |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its signals were transmitted from the [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Orbital Test Satellite]]s.&lt;ref name=bbcable/&gt; Between 1981 and 1985, TVRO systems' sales rates increased as prices fell. Advances in receiver technology and the use of [[gallium arsenide]] [[FET]] technology enabled the use of smaller dishes. Five hundred thousand systems, some costing as little as $2000, were sold in the US in 1984.&lt;ref name=Stecklow/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbca"/&gt; Dishes pointing to one satellite were even cheaper.&lt;ref name="wichita"&gt;{{cite news|title=Research Needed in Buying Dish: High Cost Is Important Consideration for Consumer|last=Stecklow|first=Steve|work=[[Wichita Eagle]]|agency=Knight-Ridder News Service|date=1984-10-25|page=6C}}&lt;/ref&gt; People in areas without local broadcast stations or cable television service could obtain good-quality reception with no monthly fees.&lt;ref name=Stecklow&gt;{{cite news|title=America's Favorite Dish|last=Stecklow|first=Steve|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|agency=[[Knight-Ridder News Service]]|date=1984-07-07|page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Akron/&gt; The large dishes were a subject of much consternation, as many people considered them [[eyesore]]s, and in the US most condominiums, neighborhoods, and other homeowner associations tightly restricted their use, except in areas where such restrictions were illegal.&lt;ref name="fcc"/&gt; These restrictions were altered in 1986 when the Federal Communications Commission ruled all of them illegal.&lt;ref name="baltsun"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Andree|date=10 October 1993|title=Old satellite dish restrictions under fire New laws urged for smaller models|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-10-10/business/1993283244_1_community-association-satellite-dish-associations-institute|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|location=[[Baltimore, MD]]|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A municipality could require a property owner to relocate the dish if it violated other zoning restrictions, such as a setback requirement, but could not outlaw their use.&lt;ref name="baltsun"/&gt; The necessity of these restrictions would slowly decline as the dishes got smaller.&lt;ref name="baltsun"/&gt;

Originally, all channels were broadcast [[in the clear]] (ITC) because the equipment necessary to receive the programming was too expensive for consumers. With the growing number of TVRO systems, the program providers and broadcasters had to [[television encryption|scramble]] their signal and develop subscription systems.

In October 1984, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984]], which gave those using TVRO systems the right to receive signals for free unless they were scrambled, and required those who did scramble to make their signals available for a reasonable fee.&lt;ref name=Akron/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-05-22/entertainment/8702080056_1_satellite-dish-satellite-tv-week-dish-owners|title=Satellite TV Skies Brighten As War With Programmers Ends|last=Takiff|first=Jonathan|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|agency=[[Knight-Ridder Newspapers]]|date=1987-05-22|accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since cable channels could prevent reception by big dishes, other companies had an incentive to offer competition.&lt;ref name=Turned&gt;{{cite news|title=Direct-Broadcast TV Is Still Not Turned On|last=Wolf|first=Ron|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=1985-01-20|page=C01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1986, [[HBO]] began using the now-obsolete [[VideoCipher]] II system to [[television encryption|encrypt their channels]].&lt;ref name="deseret"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nye|first=Doug|date=14 January 1990|title=SATELLITE DISHES SURVIVE GREAT SCRAMBLE OF 1980S|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/81378/SATELLITE-DISHES-SURVIVE-GREAT-SCRAMBLE-OF-1980S.html?pg=all|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|publisher=Deseret News|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other channels used less secure [[television encryption]] systems. The scrambling of HBO was met with much protest from owners of big-dish systems, most of which had no other option at the time for receiving such channels, claiming that clear signals from cable channels would be difficult to receive.&lt;ref name="philly"/&gt; Eventually HBO allowed dish owners to subscribe directly to their service for $12.95 per month, a price equal to or higher than what cable subscribers were paying, and required a [[descrambler]] to be purchased for $395.&lt;ref name="philly"/&gt; This led to the [[broadcast signal intrusion|attack]] on HBO's transponder [[Galaxy 1]] by [[Captain Midnight (HBO)|John R.

Videocipher II used analog scrambling on its video signal and [[Data Encryption Standard]]–based encryption on its audio signal. VideoCipher II was defeated, and there was a [[black market]] for descrambler devices which were initially sold as "test" devices.&lt;ref name="prodpiracy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paradise|first=Paul R.|date=1 January 1999|title=Trademark Counterfeiting, Product Piracy, and the Billion Dollar Threat to the U.S. Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ny0vvUpBzCYC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=black+market+for+illegal+satellite+signal+descramblers#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20market%20for%20illegal%20satellite%20signal%20descramblers&amp;f=false|location=[[Westport, Connecticut]]|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|page=147|isbn=1567202500|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The necessity for better satellite television programming than TVRO arose in the 1980s. Satellite television services, first in Europe, began transmitting K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band signals in the late 1980s. On 11 December 1988 [[Luxembourg]] launched [[Astra 1A]], the first satellite to provide medium power satellite coverage to Western Europe.&lt;ref name="n2yo2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=19688|title=ASTRA 1A Satellite details 1988-109B NORAD 19688|date=9 July 2014|publisher=N2YO|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first medium-powered satellites, transmitting signals in K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band and allowing reception with small(90&amp;nbsp;cm) dishes for the first time ever.&lt;ref name="n2yo2" /&gt; The launch of Astra beat the winner of the UK's state Direct Broadcast Satellite licence, [[British Satellite Broadcasting]], to the market, and accelerated its demise.&lt;ref name="n2yo2" /&gt;

=== 1990s to present===
By 1987, nine channels were scrambled, but 99 others were available free-to-air.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; While HBO initially charged a monthly fee of $19.95, soon it became possible to unscramble all channels for $200 a year.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; Dish sales went down from 600,000 in 1985 to 350,000 in 1986, but pay television services were seeing dishes as something positive since some people would never have cable service, and the industry was starting to recover as a result.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; Scrambling also led to the development of [[pay-per-view]] events.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; On November 1, 1988, [[NBC]] began scrambling its C-band signal but left its [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] signal unencrypted in order for affiliates to not lose viewers who could not see their advertising.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; Most of the two million satellite dish users in the United States still used C-band.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[CBS]] were considering scrambling, though CBS was reluctant due to the number of people unable to receive local [[network affiliate]]s.&lt;ref name=sfc&gt;{{cite news|title=Scrambled NBC Bad News for Satellite Pirates|work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|agency=United Press International|date=1988-11-03|page=E3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piracy on satellite television networks in the US led to the introduction of the [[Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992]]. This legislation enabled anyone caught engaging in signal theft to be fined up to $50,000 and to be sentenced to a maximum of two years in prison.&lt;ref name="cableact"&gt;{{cite act|title=Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992|number=1460|language=English|date=8 October 1992|article=STATUTE-106-Pg1460.pdf|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-106/pdf/STATUTE-106-Pg1460.pdf|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A repeat offender can be fined up to $100,000 and be imprisoned for up to five years.&lt;ref name="cableact"/&gt;

Satellite television had also developed in [[Satellite television by region#Europe|Europe]] but it initially used low power communication satellites and it required dish sizes of over 1.7 metres. On 11 December 1988 [[Luxembourg]] launched [[Astra 1A]], the first satellite to provide medium power satellite coverage to Western Europe.&lt;ref name="n2yo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=19688|title=ASTRA 1A Satellite details 1988-109B NORAD 19688|publisher=N2YO|date=9 July 2014|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first medium-powered satellites, transmitting signals in K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band and allowing reception with small dishes (90&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name="n2yo"/&gt; The launch of Astra beat the winner of the UK's state Direct Broadcast Satellite licence holder, [[British Satellite Broadcasting]], to the market.

In the US in the early 1990s, four large cable companies launched [[PrimeStar]], a direct broadcasting company using medium power satellites. The relatively strong transmissions allowed the use of smaller (90&amp;nbsp;cm) dishes. Its popularity declined with the 1994 launch of the [[Hughes Communications|Hughes]] [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] satellite television systems.

On March 4, 1996 EchoStar introduced Digital Sky Highway (Dish Network) using the EchoStar 1 satellite.&lt;ref name="ctu10e"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=August E.|date=|title=Communication Technology Update|edition=10th|url=|location=|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|page=87|isbn=978-0-240-81475-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; EchoStar launched a second satellite in September 1996 to increase the number of channels available on Dish Network to 170.&lt;ref name="ctu10e"/&gt; These systems provided better pictures and stereo sound on 150–200 video and audio channels, and allowed small dishes to be used. This greatly reduced the popularity of TVRO systems. In the mid-1990s, channels began moving their broadcasts to [[digital television]] transmission using the [[DigiCipher]] [[conditional access]] system.&lt;ref name="insead"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell-Jones |first1=Robin |last2=Berbner |first2=Jochen |last3=Chai |first3=Jianfeng |last4=Farstad |first4=Thomas |last5=Pham |first5=Minh |date=June 2001 |title=High Technology Strategy and Entrepreneurship |url=http://faculty.insead.edu/adner/projects/Set%20Top%20Boxes.pdf |journal=INSEAD journal |location=[[Fontainebleau]] |publisher=INSEAD |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724233622/http://faculty.insead.edu/adner/projects/Set%20Top%20Boxes.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to encryption, the widespread availability, in the US, of [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] services such as PrimeStar and DirecTV had been reducing the popularity of TVRO systems since the early 1990s.  Signals from DBS satellites (operating in the more recent K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band) are higher in both frequency and power (due to improvements in the [[solar panel]]s and [[energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of modern satellites) and therefore require much smaller dishes than C-band, and the [[digital modulation]] methods now used require less [[signal strength]] at the receiver than analog modulation methods.&lt;ref name="nctfe"&gt;Mirabito, M., and Morgenstern, B. (2004). ''Satellites: Operations and Applications: The New Communication Technologies'' (fifth edition). Burlington: Focal Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Each satellite also can carry up to 32 transponders in the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band, but only 24 in the C band, and several [[digital subchannel]]s can be [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]]ed (MCPC) or carried separately ([[SCPC]]) on a single transponder.&lt;ref name=artcn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khaplil|first1=Vidya R.|last2=Bhalachandra|first2=Anjali R.|date=April 2008|title=Advances in Recent Trends in Communication and Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QchLipDixBUC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=32+transponders+ku+band+24+c+band+multiplexed+satellite#v=onepage&amp;q=32%20transponders%20ku%20band%2024%20c%20band%20multiplexed%20satellite&amp;f=false |location=[[New Delhi]]|publisher=[[Allied Publishers]]|page=119|isbn=1466651709|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in [[noise reduction]] due to improved microwave technology and [[semiconductor]] materials have also had an effect.&lt;ref name=artcn/&gt; However, one consequence of the higher frequencies used for DBS services is [[rain fade]] where viewers lose signal during a heavy downpour. C-band satellite television signals are less prone to rain fade.&lt;ref name="dishcable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dish-cable.com/rain_fade.htm|title=Rain fade: satellite TV signal and adverse weather|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|year=2010|website=Dish-cable.com|publisher=Dish-cable.com|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a return to the older (but proven) technologies of satellite communication, the current DBS-based satellite providers in the USA (Dish Network and DirecTV) are now utilizing additional capacity on the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band transponders of existing FSS-class satellites, in addition to the capacity on their own existing fleets of DBS satellites in orbit.  This was done in order to provide more channel capacity for their systems, as required by the increasing number of High-Definition and simulcast local station channels.  The reception of the channels carried on the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band FSS satellite's respective transponders has been achieved by both DirecTV &amp; Dish Network issuing to their subscribers dishes twice as big in diameter (36") than the previous 18" (&amp; 20" for the Dish Network "Dish500") dishes the services used initially, equipped with 2 circular-polarized LNBFs (for reception of 2 native DBS satellites of the provider, 1 per LNBF), and 1 standard linear-polarized LNB for reception of channels from an FSS-type satellite.  These newer DBS/FSS-hybrid dishes, marketed by DirecTV and Dish Network as the "SlimLine" and "[[SuperDish]]" models respectively, are now the current standard for both providers, with their original 18"/20" single or dual LNBF dishes either now obsolete, or only used for program packages, separate channels, or services only broadcast over the providers' DBS satellites.

On 29 November 1999 US President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act]] (SHVIA).&lt;ref name="shvia"&gt;{{cite act|title=Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act|number=00-96|date=29 November 1999|article=|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/shva/shviafac.html|accessdate=30 July 2014|language=[[English language]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act allowed Americans to receive local broadcast signals via direct broadcast satellite systems for the first time.&lt;ref name="shvia" /&gt;

[[Satellite Television for the Asian Region]] (STAR), a service based in [[Mumbai]] and [[Hong Kong]] which now provides satellite TV coverage to [[Satellite television by region#Asia|Asia]] and [[Satellite television by region#Australia|Australia]], introduced satellite TV to the Asian region in the early 1990s. It began broadcasting signals using the [[AsiaSat 1]] satellite on 1 January 1991.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Satyrion''' is the name of a [[nymph]], perhaps from the region of [[Taranto]], [[Italy]]. Her union with the god [[Poseidon]] produced [[Taras (mythology)|Taras]].

'''Satyrions''' is a former name for [[orchids]] from their connection to [[satyr]]s. '''Orchis''' was the son of a satyr and a nymph, who was killed for insulting a priestess of [[Bacchus]], and was turned into the flower that bears his name.  It was believed that orchids were the food of the satyrs, and incited them to excesses.

'''Satyrion''' is also a name for [[Senecio jacobaea|ragwort]] and ancient [[aphrodisiac]] made from it. Though it may have been named after the nymph, it more likely derives from the mythical and lustful satyrs. This aphrodisiac is mentioned twice in the [[Satyricon]] of [[Petronius]].

The Telescope Array observatory is a hybrid detector system consisting of both an array of 507 scintillation surface detectors (SD) which measure the distribution of charged particles at the Earth's surface, and three fluorescence stations which observe the night sky above the SD array.&lt;ref name="AbuZayyad2012"&gt;T. AbuZayyad et al., "[http://www.telescopearray.org/media/TA_papers/1-s2.0-S0168900212005931-main.pdf The surface detector array of the Telescope Array experiment]" Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: (2012) vol. 689&lt;/ref&gt; Each fluorescence station is also accompanied by a LIDAR system for atmospheric monitoring.&lt;ref name="chikawaICRC"&gt;M. Chikawa et al., Proceedings of 29th [[International Cosmic Ray Conference|ICRC]] (2005) 137&lt;/ref&gt; The SD array is much like that of the [[AGASA]] group, but covers an area that is nine times larger. The hybrid setup of the Telescope Array project allows for simultaneous observation of both the longitudinal development and the lateral distribution of the air showers. When a cosmic ray passes through the earth's atmosphere and triggers an [[Air shower (physics)|air shower]], the fluorescence telescopes measure the scintillation light generated as the shower passes through the gas of the atmosphere, while the array of scintillator surface detectors samples the footprint of the shower when it reaches the Earth's surface.

At the center of the ground array is the Central Laser Facility which is used for atmospheric monitoring and calibrations.

==Surface detector==
[[File:SurfaceDetection.svg|thumb|A Scintillator Surface Detector from Telescope Array]]
The surface detectors that make up the ground array are activated when ionizing particles from an extensive air shower pass through them.  When these particles pass through the plastic scintillator within the detector, it induces photo electrons which are then gathered by wavelength-shifting fibers and sent to a photomultiplier tube.  The electronic components within the detectors then filter the results, giving the detectors comparable accuracy to the AGASA experiment.&lt;ref name=Kawai2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kawai|first=H|display-authors=etal |title=Telescope Array Experiment|journal=Nuclear Physics B: Proceedings Supplements|date=2008|pages=220–226|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2007.11.002|bibcode = 2008NuPhS.175..221K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface detectors are evenly distributed across a 762&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; grid array with 1.2&amp;nbsp;km between each unit.  Each surface detector has an assembled weight of 250&amp;nbsp;kg and consists of a power supply, two layers of scintillation detectors and electronics. Power is generated by a 120W solar panel and stored in a sealed lead-acid battery. The system has the capacity to operate for one week in complete darkness. Each scintillation detector layer is made of extruded plastic scintillator that is 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm thick and has an area of 3m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The photo multiplier tube is connected to the scintillator via 96 wavelength-shifting fibers.

==FD station, telescope, and camera==
{{GeoGroup}}
The Telescope Array has three fluorescence detector (FD) telescope stations. As in the previous Fly's Eye and [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|High Resolution Fly's Eye]] (HiRes) experiments, these detectors work by measuring the air fluorescence light emitted by an [[Air shower (physics)|extensive air shower]].  Each FD telescope consists of a primary mirror (made up of 18 smaller hexagonal mirror segments) and a camera.  The cameras are made up of 256 PMTs (photomultiplier tubes) which are sensitive to the ultra violet light generated by a cosmic ray air shower.&lt;ref name=Tokuno /&gt;

The stations are located on a triangle about 35&amp;nbsp;km apart from one another. Each station has 12-14 telescopes viewing the range from 3 to 33 degrees in elevation. The three sites are named ''Black Rock Mesa'' (BRM), ''Long Ridge'' (LR), and ''Middle Drum'' (MD).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telescopearray.org/index.php/research/clear-sky-clocks&lt;/ref&gt;  By combining the data from the three sites, it is possible to determine the primary energy, the arrival direction, and the maximum
point of longitudinal development for an air shower.&lt;ref name=Tokuno /&gt;

==Cosmic Ray Center==
The Lon and Mary Watson Millard County Cosmic Ray Center was dedicated on March 20, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Draper, Dean (March 22, 2006). "Cosmic ray center dedicated". Millard County Chronicle Progress&lt;/ref&gt; The center is located at 648 West Main Street in Delta. The building serves as a headquarters and data processing center for the Telescope Array Project.

In October 2011, a new visitor center was opened at the Cosmic Ray Center.  It features displays about the history of cosmic ray research in Utah and about the Telescope Array, which is spread across the desert west of Delta. The center also includes a display about the nearby Topaz internment camp, where U.S. citizens of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II.

==TALE==
TALE is the Telescope Array Low Energy extension. It is designed to observe cosmic rays with energies between 3×10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;eV and 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;eV. TALE adds 10 new telescopes to the Middle Drum observatory site (24 total telescopes) extending the vertical field of view so that it now extends from 3 to 59 degrees in elevation.  This allows the station to see the shower development including shower maximum for lower energy events.  This is critical when trying to determine the chemical composition of the incident cosmic ray particle.&lt;ref name=Martens2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martens|first=Kai|title=The Telescope Array and its Low Energy Extension|journal=Nuclear Physics B: Proceedings Supplements|date=2007|volume=165|pages=33–36|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2006.11.006|bibcode = 2007NuPhS.165...33M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TALE project also has a graded infill array of scintillator stations spaced 400m and 600m apart. It then connects to the main Telescope Array scintillator array where the scintillator detectors are 1200m apart.  These stations measure charged particle densities (the shower footprint) at the Earth's surface for lower energy events approaching 3x10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;eV

==TARA==
The Telescope Array RADAR (TARA) Project is an effort to overcome some of the problems inherent to current cosmic ray detection techniques.  Due to sun, moon and weather, fluorescence telescopes are usually limited to a ten percent duty cycle.  Ground arrays can run during the day, but require a large amount of land, making it necessary to build them in remote locations.  The goal of the TARA Project is to develop a [[bistatic radar]] detection system that is able to maintain a 24-hour duty cycle at a fraction of the cost of conventional detection systems.&lt;ref name=AbouBakrOthman2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abou Bakr Othman|first=M.|display-authors=etal |title=Radar Detection of UHECR Air Showers at the Telescope Array|journal=32nd International Cosmic Ray Conference, Beijing 2011|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the [[W. M. Keck Foundation]] awarded researchers at the University of Utah a $1 million grant to develop a bistatic radar detection system.  This system will be built alongside the existing Telescope Array and will use analog television transmitters and digital receivers to observe the range, direction and strength of cosmic rays in order to trace them back to their point of origin.&lt;ref name=EON2012&gt;{{cite news|title=University of Utah Awarded $1 Million by Keck Foundation to Study Cosmic Rays|url=http://eon.businesswire.com/news/eon/20120925005365/en/University-Utah-Awarded-1-Million-Keck-Foundation|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=EON: Enhanced Online News|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once completed, this new facility will be known as the W.M. Keck Radar Observatory&lt;ref name=EON2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Jasen|title=$1M grant awarded to U. to study cosmic particles|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=22296297|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=KSL|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Thorne–Żytkow object''' ('''TŻO''' or '''TZO''') is a conjectured type of [[star]] wherein a [[red giant]] or [[red supergiant|supergiant]] contains a [[neutron star]] at its core, formed from the [[Stellar collision|collision]] of the giant with the neutron star. Such objects were hypothesized by [[Kip Thorne]] and [[Anna Żytkow]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=tz77&gt;{{cite journal | title = Stars with degenerate neutron cores.

== Formation ==

A Thorne–Żytkow object is formed when a [[neutron star]] collides with a [[star]], typically a red giant or supergiant. The colliding objects can simply be wandering stars. This is only likely to occur in extremely crowded [[globular cluster]]s. Alternatively, the neutron star could form in a [[binary star|binary system]] after one of the two stars went [[supernova]]. Because [[Supernova#Asymmetry|no supernova is perfectly symmetric]], and because the binding energy of the binary changes with the mass lost in the supernova, the neutron star will be left with some velocity relative to its original orbit. This kick may cause its new orbit to intersect with its companion, or, if its companion is a [[main-sequence star]], it may be engulfed when its companion evolves into a red giant.&lt;ref name=brandt95&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brandt|first=W. Niel|last2 = Podsiadlowski | first2 = Philipp|title=The effects of high-velocity supernova kicks on the orbital properties and sky distributions of neutron-star binaries|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=May 1995|volume=274|issue=2|pages=461–484|bibcode = 1995MNRAS.274..461B|doi=10.1093/mnras/274.2.461|arxiv=astro-ph/9412023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the neutron star enters the red giant, [[drag (physics)|drag]] between the neutron star and the outer, diffuse layers of the red giant causes the binary star system's [[orbit]] to decay, and the neutron star and core of the red giant spiral inward toward one another. Depending on their initial separation, this process may take hundreds of years. When the two finally collide, the neutron star and red giant core will merge. If their combined mass exceeds the [[Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit]] then the two will collapse into a [[black hole]], resulting in a [[supernova]] that disperses the outer layers of the star.  Otherwise, the two will coalesce into a single neutron star.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

If a neutron star and a [[white dwarf]] merge, this could form a Thorne–Żytkow object with the properties of an [[R Coronae Borealis variable]].&lt;ref name=1999ApJ...514..932V&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vanture |first=Andrew | last2 = Zucker | first2 = Daniel | last3 = Wallerstein | first3 = George |title=U Aquarii a Thorne–Żytkow Object? |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|date=April 1999 |volume=514 |issue=2 |pages=932–938 |doi=10.1086/306956 |bibcode=1999ApJ...514..932V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

The surface of the neutron star is very hot, with temperatures exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Kelvin|K]]: hotter than the cores of all but the most massive stars.  This heat is dominated either by [[nuclear fusion]] in the accreting gas or by compression of the gas by the neutron star's gravity.&lt;ref name=eich89&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eich | first = Chris | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Mark | last3 = Thorne | first3 = Kip | author3-link = Kip Thorne | last4 = Żytkow | first4 = Anna N. | author4-link = Anna N.

[[Hydrogen]] may fuse to produce a different mixture of [[isotope]]s than it does in ordinary [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], and some astronomers have proposed that the [[Rp-process|rapid proton nucleosynthesis]] that occurs in X-ray bursts also takes place inside Thorne–Żytkow objects.&lt;ref name=cannon93&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Robert|title=Massive Thorne–Żytkow Objects – Structure and Nucleosynthesis|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=August 1993|volume=263|issue=4|pages=817 |bibcode = 1993MNRAS.263..817C | doi = 10.1093/mnras/263.4.817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observationally, a Thorne–Żytkow object may resemble a [[red supergiant]],&lt;ref name=1406.0001/&gt; or, if it is hot enough to blow off the hydrogen-rich surface layers, a nitrogen-rich [[Wolf–Rayet star]] (type WN8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= Are Peculiar Wolf-Rayet Stars of Type WN8 Thorne-Zytkow Objects? | first1 = C. | last1 = Foellmi | first2 = A.F.J. | bibcode= 2002ASPC..263..123F |arxiv= astro-ph/0607217 |date= 2002 |isbn= 1-58381-103-6 | booktitle = Stellar Collisions, Mergers and their Consequences | conference = ASP Conference Proceedings | volume = 263 | editor-first = Michael M. | editor-last = Shara |last2 = Moffat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TŻO has an estimated lifespan of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; years. Given this lifespan, it is possible that between 20 and 200 Thorne-Żytkow objects currently exist in the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Podsiadlowski|first=P.|last2=Cannon|first2=R.

== Dissolution ==

It has been theorized that the evolution of TŻOs will result in neutron stars with massive [[accretion disc]]s, as mass loss will end the TŻO stage, and the remaining envelope converts to being a disc.&lt;ref name=1995ApJ...455..598M&gt;{{cite journal |title= A Spin-down Variation in the 6 Second X-Ray Pulsar 1E 1048.1-5937 |journal= Astrophysical Journal |volume=455 |page=598 | last = Mereghetti | first = Sandro |publicationdate= December 1995 |doi= 10.1086/176607 |bibcode= 1995ApJ...455..598M |date= 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These neutron stars may form the population of isolated [[pulsar]]s with accretion discs.&lt;ref name=1995ApJ...455..598M/&gt; The massive accretion disc may also result in the collapse of a star, becoming a stellar companion to the neutron star. The neutron star may also accrete sufficient material to collapse into a [[black hole]].&lt;ref name=1995MNRAS.277L..35B/&gt;

== Observation history ==

As of 2014, the most recent candidate, star [[HV 2112]], has been observed to have some unusual properties that suggest that it may be a Thorne–Żytkow object. The discovering team, with [[Emily Levesque]] being the lead author, noted that HV 2112 displays some chemical characteristics that don't quite match theoretical models, but emphasize that the theoretical predictions for a Thorne–Żytkow object are quite old and theoretical improvements have been made since it was originally conceptualized.&lt;ref name=1406.0001&gt;{{cite journal |last= Levesque |first= Emily |last2 = Massey | first2 = Philip | first3 = Anna | last3 = Żytkow | author3-link = Anna N.

Recent work reappraising the properties of [[HV 2112]] however has shown that star is unlikely to be a Thorne-Żytkow object, and it is more likely an intermediate mass [[AGB star]]. &lt;ref name=beasor/&gt;

'''''Vertebrate Palaeontology''''' is a basic textbook on [[vertebrate paleontology]] by [[Michael J. Benton]], published by  [[Blackwell Publishing|Blackwell's]].  It has so far appeared in four editions, published in 1990, 1997, 2005, and 2014.  It is designed for [[paleontology]] graduate courses in [[biology]] and [[geology]] as well as for the interested layman.

The book is widely used, and has received excellent reviews: 
*"This book is a ′must′ for a biology or geology student and researcher concerned by palaeontology. It perfectly succeeds in showing how palaeobiological information is obtained". Review of 3rd edition, ''Zentrallblatt fur Geologie und Palaontologie'', 2007.
*"One anticipates that Benton's ''Vertebrate Palaeontology'' will become the 'industry standard', and as such it should occupy space on the shelves of all involved in undergraduate teaching". Ivan Sansom, School of Earth Sciences, University of Birmingham. Review of the 2nd edition for the Micropalaeontological Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sansom|first=I|title=VERTEBRATE PALAEONTOLOGY|url=http://www.tmsoc.org/review.htm#benton|work=Book Reviews|publisher=The Micropalaeontological Society|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"... his expertise in a range of problems of vertebrate paleontology is amazing. As a result the contents of his book [are] very well balanced". Jerzy Dzik, Instytut Palaeobiologii PAN, Warsaw. Review of the 3rd edition for the ''Journal of Sedimentary Research''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dzik|first=J.|title=Vertebrate Palaeontology (3rd ed.), by Michael J.

The book gives an overall account of every major group of living and fossil vertebrate.  At the rear of the book is a [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] classification which combines both the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean hierarchy]] and the [[cladistic]] arrangement, and has been used as a guideline for the Wikipedia pages on living and extinct vertebrate taxa.  However, some of Benton's classification differs from that in the [[Tree of Life Web Project]], especially as regards the relationship of early amphibian groups ([[Batrachomorpha]] and [[Reptiliomorpha]]).

The '''Waterpod''' was a community-based public art project in New York City in 2009. Open to the public, an ecosystem on a barge called the Waterpod visited the five boroughs at eight different piers for two weeks at a time during the summer of 2009, hosting a series of events.  It was designed as a futuristic habitat and an experimental platform for assessing the design and efficacy of autonomous marine living systems in preparation for an assumed future.
A multinational team including artists, designers, marine engineers, and civic activists led by the artist [[Mary Mattingly]] alongside the New York City Office of the Mayor Special Projects, the [[United States Coast Guard]], and the New York City SBS Dockmaster Unit, this was a cross-disciplinary project that took place in the waterways of New York City in 2009.

== Route ==
The Waterpod Project route:
* June 12 – June 21: South Street Seaport, Pier 17, [[Manhattan]]
* June 22 – July 6: Sheepshead Bay Marina, Brooklyn
* July 7 – 20: [[Governors Island|Governor’s Island]] Yankee Pier
* July 21 – August 3: [[Manhattanville,_Manhattan#West_Harlem_Piers|West Harlem Piers Park]], Manhattan
* August 4 – 17: [[Brooklyn Bridge Park|Brooklyn Bridge Park Pier 5]], Brooklyn
* August 18 – August 31: Atlantic Salt Pier, [[Staten Island]]
* September 1 – September 14: [[Bronx River|Concrete Plant Park]], the Bronx
* September 15 – October 15: [[World's Fair Marina]],  Flushing, Queens

== Goals ==
"...to fortify against the possibility of widespread climate change, desertification, and provide solutions for overpopulation and rising sea levels, the Waterpod offered a pathway to sustainable survival, mobility, and community building through a free, participatory project and event space that visited the five boroughs and Governors Island, for a voyage lasting from June to October 2009. The Waterpod’s mission has been to prepare, inform, and offer alternatives to current and future living spaces..."

"...The Waterpod provides space for: (I) community and artistic activity; (II) eco-initiatives including food grown with filtered rainwater; and (III) living space. It provides a model for mobile vessels that can provide relief to cities and countries struck by natural disasters, as well as a model for reshaping suburban landscapes to be a self-sustaining living system.   The methods that make up the Waterpod provide people with necessary systems for rotational food supply, seasonal seed collection and soil-renewing compost, potable water, and mobile shelter with minimal upkeep..."

The Waterpod was an experiment in creatively using available, local reused materials from the New York Waste Stream:
"...The dome covers were constructed Waterpod’s from repurposed billboard vinyl...The soil was made in the Bronx from compost and sand, tested and donated from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation... Construction materials also included salvaged pieces of sunken vessels raised from the rivers bottom in the Rockaway and other areas."
