The '''[[1993–94 NHL season|1993–94]] [[Calgary Flames]] season''' was the [[Calgary Flames seasons|14th]] [[National Hockey League]] [[Season (sports)|season]] in [[Calgary]].  It was a season of change across the NHL, as the league reorganized its divisions and playoff format.  The [[Smythe Division]] was retired and the Flames joined the new [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]], as the NHL aligned itself with the other major sports leagues in naming divisions by geographical boundaries.  The change angered fans, who preferred the traditional convention, which honoured the game's past builders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/hockey/nhl/01/18/values.debate/index.html A question of values], sportsillustrated.com, January 18, 2007, accessed March 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Realignment also led to significant changes in the playoff format, as the top eight teams in each conference now qualified for the post-season, rather than the top four in each division.  Under the new format, the top team in each division was guaranteed one of the top two seeds, and declared the divisional champion, as opposed to having to win two playoff rounds to capture the division title.  Thus, the Flames became the first Pacific Division champions, and the second seed in the playoffs.  They faced the second place [[Vancouver Canucks]] in the playoffs rather than the fourth place [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] who failed to qualify under the new system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1272/is_n2582_v122/ai_14716426 Hockey's revised roadmap], USAToday, reproduced by findarticles.com, November 1993, accessed March 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The playoffs ended in another bitter disappointment, as the Flames blew a 3–1 series lead, losing the last three games in overtime to the Canucks,&lt;ref&gt;All-time playoff results, ''2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pg. 220&lt;/ref&gt; who would eventually go onto the [[Stanley Cup]] finals before bowing out to the [[New York Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/features/si_stanley_cup/1994/ SI Flashback: Stanley Cup 1994], sportsillustrated.com, accessed March 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Flames represented the Western Conference at the [[45th National Hockey League All-Star Game|1994 All-Star Game]]: Forward [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] and defenceman [[Al MacInnis]].&lt;ref&gt;All-star selections, ''2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

For the second consecutive season, four Flames reached the 30-goal plateau. Three of them (Theoren Fleury, Robert Reichel and Gary Roberts) were also 40-goal scorers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/CGY/1993.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/CGY/1994.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the season, Calgary lost two players in the [[1993 NHL Expansion Draft]], as the [[Florida Panthers]] selected defenceman [[Alexander Godynyuk]] 13th overall, and centre [[Brian Skrudland]] 32nd overall.  The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim did not select any Flames players.

{{TOClimit|limit=2}}

==Regular season==

The Flames were shorthanded a total of 465 times during the regular season, the most among all 26 teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1994.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929125153/http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1994.html |archivedate=2013-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playoffs==
The Flames entered the 1994 [[Stanley Cup]] playoffs as the second seed under the new alignment, facing the seventh seeded [[Vancouver Canucks]].  After getting blown out at home in game one, the Flames responded by winning the next three games to take a 3–1 series lead.  The Flames, however, lost the last three games in overtime, as they proved unable to overcome a series of injuries to key players, and the tenacious play of the Canucks.  [[Pavel Bure]] scored the series winner on a breakaway in double overtime for the Canucks, who reached the Stanley Cup finals before falling to the [[New York Rangers]] in seven games.

For the Flames, it was another year of playoff frustration, as for the fifth consecutive year, Calgary failed to reach the second round of the post-season.

The '''1stBank Center''' (originally the '''Broomfield Event Center''' and formerly the '''Odeum Colorado''') is a multi-purpose arena located 15 miles northwest of [[Downtown Denver]], in the city of [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]]. It is located near the [[Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport]] and the [[Flatiron Crossing Mall]]. Opening in 2006, the arena naming rights belong to 1stBank, a local financial institution since 2010. The venue is typically used for mid-sized concerts in the [[Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area|Denver Metro]] area, seating up to 7,500 patrons. From June 2010 until May 2014, the arena housed the Colorado Music Hall of Fame before it moved to its permanent home at the [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2013/11/10/colorado-music-hall-of-fame-to-permanently-move-to-red-rocks/ |title=Colorado Music Hall of Fame To Permanently Move To Red Rocks | date=November 10, 2013 |website=[[KCNC-TV]] |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For sports, it is the current home of the [[Denver Roller Dolls]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Paula |date=January 21, 2010 |title=Roller derby coming to Broomfield's Odeum|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2010/01/18/daily72.html?page=all |newspaper=Denver Business Journal |accessdate=January 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and former home of the [[Rocky Mountain Rage]] and [[Colorado 14ers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Broomfield Event Center opens Thursday |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2006/11/06/daily32.html |newspaper=Denver Business Journal |date=November 7, 2006|accessdate=January 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Broomfield Event Center.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Exterior of arena during construction, May 2009]]
The City and County of Broomfield unveiled plans for a new sports facility in the Denver Metro area, in May 2005. Led by Jim Wiens and John Few, the venue is an anchor for the 215-acre commercial and residential development, Arista Metropolitan District (also called Arista Broomfield). The facility would serve as competition for several mid-sized venues in Colorado, including the: [[Magness Arena]], [[Bellco Theatre]], [[Fillmore Auditorium (Denver)|Fillmore Auditorium]], [[Budweiser Events Center]], [[World Arena, Colorado Springs|World Arena]] and the (now defunct) City Lights Pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.westword.com/backbeat/2009/12/odeum_colorado_--_the_new_name.php |title=Odeum Colorado -- the new name for the Broomfield Event Center -- to open this spring with pair of concerts by Furthur |last1=Herrera |first1=Dave |last2= |first2= |date=December 3, 2009 |website=[[Westword]] |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To set it apart from its competition, the arena was designed to give an arena-sized show a theatre (intimate) feeling.

Construction began in October 2006 to a rocky start. Six months after construction began, the venue's owners faced a lawsuit regarding noise control. Before opening, the facility saw several staff and management changes. Despite pushbacks, the venue opened on November 9, 2006, with a concert by [[Bonnie Raitt]]. However, the facility proved it couldn’t stand against its competitors. Many patrons complained of lack of parking and street sign leading to the venue. Others complained about the acoustics, describing the arena as a concrete barn. For its first two years of operation, the venue did not see a profit. It was unable to pay bills and staff salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Paula |date= |title=Broomfield Event Center weathers growing pains |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2007/03/26/story5.html?page=all |newspaper=Denver Business Journal |accessdate=January 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2009, the arena was operated by Broomfield Sports and Entertainment (created by Wiens and Frew).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Paula |date=February 4, 2010 |title=FirstBank buys naming rights to Broomfield arena |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2010/02/01/daily55.html?page=all |newspaper=[[Denver Business Journal]] |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Management ceased when the company could no longer financially afford to maintain the failing venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Paula |date=February 18, 2009 |title=Broomfield seeks new operator for Events Center |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2009/02/16/daily39.html?page=all |newspaper=Denver Business Journal |accessdate=January 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broomfield Urban Renewal Authority (BURA) began seeking a new management company in January 2009. [[AEG Live]], VenuWorks and [[SMG (property management)|SMG]] all placed bids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Report: Anschutz's AEG, SMG vying for Broomfield Event Center contract |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2009/04/27/daily25.html?page=all|newspaper=Denver Business Journal |date=April 27, 2009 |accessdate=January 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operations were passed off to Peak Entertainment&amp;mdash;a joint venture between [[Kroenke Sports Enterprises]] and AEG Live Rocky Mountains, in June 2009, for 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Anschutz-Kroenke venture picked to run Broomfield Event Center |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2009/06/15/daily50.html?page=all|newspaper=Denver Business Journal |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=January 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chuck Morris, President and CEO or AEG Live Rocky Mountains, was responsible to the revitalization of the Fillmore Auditorium.

Under the new management, the venue saw over one million dollars in renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/ci_13909884 |title=Odeum new name in Broomfield entertainment |last1=Davidson |first1=Michael |last2= |first2= |date=December 2, 2009 |website=[[Broomfield Enterprise]] |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included a new paint job, window treatments, terrace balconies, improvements to lighting and acoustics. Over 2,000 parking spaces were added, along with a pedestrian bridge connecting patrons to RTD's US 36 and Broomfield Park-n-Ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.westword.com/backbeat/2010/03/a_first_look_at_the_newly_reno.php |title=Moving Pictures: A first look at the newly renovated 1st Bank Center |last1=Herrera |first1=Dave|last2= |first2= |date=March 4, 2010 |website=Westword |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_14436498?source=most_viewed |title=Broomfield 1stBank Center off to fast start |last1=Collins |first1=Mark |last2= |first2= |date=February 22, 2010 |website=[[Daily Camera]] |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this construction period, the facility was given a temporary name change of Odeum Colorado. In February 2010, it was announced local financial institution,  FirstBank Holding Company of Colorado, Inc. (known simply as 1stBank) purchased naming rights for five years, at an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coloradodaily.com/out-there/ci_14328631 |title=1stBank Center: Odeum Colorado, formerly Broomfield Event Center, renamed again |last1=Davidson |first1=Michael |date=February 4, 2010 |website=[[Colorado Daily]] |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement began on March 1, 2010. The arena reopened on March 5, 2010, with a concert by [[Furthur (band)|Furthur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_13922613 |title=With Furthur ado, Odeum Colorado to replace Broomfield Event Center |last1=Baca |first1=Ricardo |last2= |first2= |date=December 4, 2009 |website=[[The Denver Post]] |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its reopening, the arena has hosted numerous concerts by popular artists, alongside family shows and sporting events.

The '''Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez''' is a {{convert|4.304|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[motorsport]] [[race track]] in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]], named after the racing drivers [[Ricardo Rodríguez (racing driver)|Ricardo]] and [[Pedro Rodríguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodríguez]]. The circuit got its name shortly after it opened when [[Ricardo Rodríguez (Formula One)|Ricardo Rodríguez]] died in practice for the non-Championship [[1962 Mexican Grand Prix]]. Ricardo's brother [[Pedro Rodríguez (racing driver)|Pedro]] also lost his life behind the wheel nine years later. Since [[2015 Mexican Grand Prix|2015]] the track once again is a host of the [[Formula One]] [[Mexican Grand Prix]], an event it previously hosted in two separarate time periods on a different layout, the last occasion of which was in [[1992 Mexican Grand Prix|1992]].

The circuit is located within the public park of the [[Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City]] in southeast [[Mexico City]]. The circuit is owned by the Government of the City, but is currently operated under concession by Corporación Interamericana de Entretenimiento (CIE) through OCESA, one of CIE's subsidiaries. CIE also organizes the [[NASCAR]] and Desafío Coron races in this circuit and rents the circuits to other parties, including race organizers, automobile clubs and track amateurs for fees that are controversial due to their disproportionately high amounts compared to other ex-F1 courses.

The [[NASCAR]] [[Xfinity Series]] started racing at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in the 2005 season and ended in the 2008 season. [[Martin Truex Jr.]] won the race in 2005, and [[Denny Hamlin]] won in 2006. For the 2007 race, the chicane was removed to increase passing opportunities down the front straight and into turn 1, and [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] from [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], won the race. [[Kyle Busch]] was the winner of the race in 2008.

The [[A1 Grand Prix]] series started racing at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in the [[2006–07 A1 Grand Prix season|2006–07 season]] using the full-track configuration used by [[Formula One]]. [[Alex Yoong]] from [[A1 Team Malaysia|Malaysia]] won the sprint race and [[Oliver Jarvis]] from the [[United Kingdom]] won the feature race. In the [[2007–08 A1 Grand Prix season|2007–08 season]], [[Jonny Reid]] from [[A1 Team New Zealand|New Zealand]] won the sprint race and [[Adam Carroll]] of [[A1 Team Ireland|Team Ireland]] won the feature race.

==History==
Built in a public park in 1959, the circuit hosted its first [[Formula One]] [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] in 1962, as a non-Championship race. The following year the [[Mexican Grand Prix]] became a full World Championship event.  The circuit remained part of the F1 calendar through 1970, when spectator overcrowding caused unsafe conditions.  When the track re-opened in 1986, the circuit boasted a new pit complex, as well as improved safety all around. In 2001 CIE and Forsythe Racing tasked D3 Motorsport Development with revamping the circuit. A redesign to include the Foro and a complete upgrade of the circuit was done. It saw a record crowd of 402,413 people attend a round of the CART Championship in 2002.  As of 2018, the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez has been the only venue for the F1 Mexican Grand Prix.

It was announced in May 2012, that the circuit would again host the [[Mexican Grand Prix]] from 2013, in a five-year deal that would see it replace the [[European Grand Prix]] in [[Valencia Street Circuit|Valencia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/2012/05/29/motor/formula1/1338288393.html |title=México tendrá gran premio ya para 2013 |publisher=MARCA.com |date= |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this did not happen. The FIA listed the Mexican Grand Prix as the 19th round of the provisional schedule for the [[2014 Formula One season|2014 season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2013/09/05/mexico-in-new-jersey-out-on-21-race-2014-calendar/ |title=2014 Calendar draft has 21 races including Mexico |publisher=f1fanatic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not on the finalized schedule. The Mexican Grand Prix was listed on the 2015 Formula One calendar published by the FIA on 3 December 2014, with [[Formula One]] making its return to the circuit with the race on 1 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Motor Sport Council 2014 - Doha |url=http://www.fia.com/node/9172 |publisher=FIA |accessdate=22 December 2014 |date=3 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319200239/http://www.fia.com/node/9172 |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racetrack is also home to Insomnniacs Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC Mexico) a popular music festival and experience attended by over 200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mexico.electricdaisycarnival.com/en/travel/#location|title=TRAVEL - EDC Mexico 2018|website=electricdaisycarnival.com|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Grand Prix circuit ==
[[File:Grand-Am Rolex Series Mexico 2008.jpg|thumb|left|355px|[[Grand-Am Rolex Series]] taking a bypass from turn 4 to turn 8]]

The circuit has an elevation of 2,285 m (7,500&amp;nbsp;ft); the thin air causes difficulties for both the drivers and their cars.

The circuit has an extremely fast final corner (the ''Peraltada'', turn 17) before a long start/finish straight, and thus reminded some of [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]]; however, unlike Monza's ''parabolica'' curve, the ''Peraltada'' curve is slightly banked, allowing even more speed through the corner. It was at this corner that the younger Rodríguez crashed, due to suspension failure. After the last F1 Mexican Grand Prix in 1992, a baseball stadium called the ''"Foro"'' was built on the inner part of this curve. When the [[Champ Car]] series began using the track in 2002, the ''Peraltada'' curve was partially bypassed by a series of sharp turns entering and exiting the ''Foro''; re-entering the ''Peraltada'' halfway through.

After the Peraltada comes the long 1.2&amp;nbsp;km front straight. During the original turbo era in Formula One the faster cars were regularly clocking speeds of up to {{Convert|330|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}} on the straight.

In the [[2005 NASCAR Busch Series]] season, there was a [[chicane]] on the main straightaway to slow the cars down. They also introduced a curve between the short course and the Ese del Lago to bypass the latter, but avoiding the stadium detour.

The Grand Prix circuit underwent a significant renovation under the direction of [[Hermann Tilke]] for the return of [[Formula One]] in {{F1|2015}}. The front straight was slightly extended and reprofiled to accommodate a new media center and paddock. The iconic esses between turns 7 and 13 were significantly modified; the prolific, high radius turns largely diminished and some replaced with fixed angle turns. The baseball field portion of the track was also altered to a low speed left-right combination that bypassed the first half of the Peraltada, allowing the cars to re-enter the Peraltada halfway through the corner. At {{convert|4.304|km|mi}}, the course is {{convert|170|m|ft}} shorter than the previous Grand Prix layout, and [[Mexican Grand Prix]] organisers predicted lap times of around 75 seconds and speeds in excess of {{convert|328|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for the [[Formula one engines#2014|current turbocharged Formula One cars]], which eliminate the adverse effects of altitude present in naturally aspirated cars.&lt;ref name="tilke" /&gt; However it turns out the modern V6 hybrid turbo F1 cars managed to reach the top speed in excess of {{convert|370|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} down the main straight.

== The oval track ==
[[File:Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez 1986-2014.svg|thumb|right|250px|The 1986–2001 Grand Prix layout.]]
[[File:Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez 1963.svg|thumb|right|250px|The original Magdalena Mixhuca circuit used in 1962–1970.]]
[[File:Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez formula-e.svg|thumb|right|250px|The Formula E layout, based on both the oval and modern Grand Prix layouts]]

The circuit also features an oval layout due to the inclusion of a flat turn that goes from the middle of the main straight to the beginning of the back stretch of circuit. Unlike the road course, the oval is raced in counter-clockwise direction (except for the Formula E race).

The oval configuration of this Mexico City facility is arguably the most dangerous racetrack in Mexico, because of the limited visibility at the exit of Turns 2 and 4. This is because the [[Foro Sol]] baseball stadium is located inside turns 1 and 2; and several trees are located inside turns 3 and 4.

During the 2006 season, two accidents occurred in the oval track during [[NASCAR Mexico T4 Series]] events, which took several drivers out of the race and even required some of them to be taken to hospital.

The oval configuration is used at least twice a year, with two double-feature events featuring the [[NASCAR Toyota Series]] and the [[NASCAR Mexico T4 Series]].

The oval configuration also forms the base of the [[FIA Formula E Championship]] circuit for the [[Mexico City ePrix]];  the oval is raced clockwise, but there is a chicane that will be used prior to the entrance of Turn 4, with a second chicane on the backstretch, followed by a modified [[Foro Sol]] section that exits for the full Peraltada, and a third chicane will be placed midway through the Peraltada (Turns 1 and 2 of the oval). FIA Formula E track design was modified by Agustin Delicado Zomeño.

== Renamed turns ==

In 2015 the Turn 17 of the Autodromo Hermanos Rodríguez was baptized in honour of [[Formula One]] legend [[Nigel Mansell]], twice winner of the Mexican Grand Prix of [[1987 Mexican Grand Prix|1987]] and [[1992 Mexican Grand Prix|1992]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/headlines/2015/9/mexico-names-final-corner-after-nigel-mansell.html|title=Mexico names final corner after Nigel Mansell|website=formula1.com|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2016 [[Adrián Fernández]]'s achievements have been recognised by the naming of Turn 12 of the Autodromo in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/adrian-fernandez-has-corner-named-after-him-in-mexico-city-829213/|title=Adrian Fernandez has corner named after him in Mexico City|website=motorsport.com|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The baseball stadium ==
{{Main|Foro Sol}}

The Autódromo is unique in the sense that there is a baseball stadium inside Turn 14 (Peraltada). The stadium, called [[Foro Sol]], was home to the [[Diablos Rojos del México]], and also hosts music concerts.

Artists like [[Iron Maiden]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Metallica]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[U2]], and [[Radiohead]] are just a few of the names that have played there.

The Coca-Cola Zero Festival was held at the racetrack on 12 April 2008 [http://coca-colazero.com.mx/]. Acts included [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[The Mars Volta]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[My Morning Jacket]], [[Belanova]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], [[Kinky (band)|Kinky]] and [[Miranda!]].

The '''BT Arena''' is a multi-purpose [[indoor arena]] that is located in [[Cluj-Napoca]], Romania. The arena was previously called the '''Polyvalent Hall''' but was renamed on 17 October 2017 when the facility entered into a new arena-naming rights agreement with [[Banca Transilvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalbaschet.ro/articol/Sala-Polivalent%C4%83-din-Cluj-Napoca-devine-BT-Arena~53879|title=Banca Transilvania a semnat n contract pe cinci ani cu arena clujeană|publisher=Total Baschet|date=18 October 2017|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telekomsport.ro/a-inceput-amenajarea-suprafetei-de-zgura-la-bt-arena-din-cluj-napoca-pentru-intalnirea-romania-elvetia-din-fedcup-18064764|title=A început amenajarea suprafeţei de zgură la BT Arena din Cluj-Napoca, pentru întâlnirea România – Elveţia, din FedCup|publisher=Telekom Sport|accessdate=9 May 2018|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venue holds 10,000 people in its largest configuration.

==History== 

The arena opened on 21 October 2014. The arena hosted a concert, on 31 October 2014, by English musician [[James Blunt]], who sang from his album [[Moon Landing (album)|Moon Landing]]. The concert had an attendance of upwards of 6,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stirileprotv.ro/video/sase-mii-de-oameni-au-asistat-la-concertul-lui-james-blunt-din-cluj-artistul-a-fost-purtat-pe-brate-de-fani/61591470|title=Sase mii de oameni au asistat la concertul lui James Blunt din Cluj|publisher=[[Pro TV]]|accessdate=7 November 2014|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesblunt.com/live,cluj-polyvalent-hall_307.htm?pg=1|title=TOUR DATES|publisher=jamesblunt.com|accessdate=7 November 2014|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''beIN Media Group''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|ɪ|n}} {{respell|BEE|in}}; {{lang-ar|مجموعة بي إن الإعلامية}}, ''Majmū‘at Bī’in al-I‘lāmiyyah'') is a Qatari sport and entertainment network founded on 1 January 2014 by [[Nasser Al-Khelaifi]], headquartered in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]]. The network [[beIN Sports]] was created in France in June 2012.

== History ==
[[beIN Sports]] as a brand was first launched in June 2012 in France. On 31 December 2013, Al Jazeera Sport was officially [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] from the [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] to become beIN Sports. In October 2014, it was announced that beIN Media Group had agreed to acquire pay-TV sports channel Setanta Sports Australia, with Setanta being rebranded as [[BeIN Sports (Australia)|beIN Sports Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=beIn Media Group to acquire Setanta Sports Australia|url=http://www.businessandleadership.com/marketing/item/47135-bein-media-group-to-acquire|website=Business and Leadership.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[beIN Sports]] launched a HD channel specially dedicated to football in [[Spain]].

The '''Champion Stakes''' was an American [[Thoroughbred horse race]] run annually in August at the Monmouth Park Association's racetrack in [[Long Branch, New Jersey]]. Inaugurated in 1879, the Champion Stakes was open to horses of any age and was raced on dirt over a distance of one and one half miles (12 [[furlong]]s).

In 1891, the races at Long Branch had to be shifted to racetracks in [[New York (state)|New York]] when government legislation attempted to inhibit [[parimutuel wagering]]. The races were split between the [[Jerome Park Racetrack]]  in [[Fordham, Bronx]] and at the nearby [[Morris Park Racecourse]] at [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester Village]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1891/06/29/archives/no-races-at-long-branch-stake-dates-fixed-for-morris-and-jerome.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Monmouth Park Racing Association closed and the land sold after its operating license was revoked in 1893 and government legislation was enacted that banned parimutuel wagering.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1893/12/26/archives/monmouth-parks-license-revoked-action-taken-by-the-local.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final running of the Champion Stakes in 1892, [[Lamplighter (horse)|Lamplighter]] set a new stakes and track record.

'''Cook''' (dates unknown) was an English professional [[cricket]]er from [[Brentford]] who played in [[first-class cricket]] for [[Middlesex county cricket teams|Middlesex]] and [[Brentford Cricket Club]] during the 1730s.  He was "reckoned one of the best bowlers in England".&lt;ref name=GB&gt;Buckley, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Cook is mentioned in 1735 re two matches at [[Moulsey Hurst]]. He played as a given man for [[London Cricket Club]] versus [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] on Saturday, 7 June;&lt;ref name=GB/&gt; and for a combined London &amp; Middlesex XI versus [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] on Saturday, 12 July.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;Waghorn, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first match, Cook was hired as a replacement for [[Ellis (London cricketer)|Ellis]] of London, who was "their best bowler".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;  With Cook's help, London won the game by 9 wickets.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;  In the second match, he was one of three Middlesex players in the combined XI which included eight London players.&lt;ref name=GB/&gt;

As Cook had established his reputation by 1735, he must have been active for some years previously and his career probably began in the 1720s. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other references to Cook.

'''Coundon Road Stadium''' in [[Coventry]] was the home ground for [[Coventry R.F.C.]] from 1921 to 2004. The stadium has now been demolished.

[[File:Last day at coundon kickoff.jpg|thumb|left|Manchester, in red, kick off for the last match at the ground. The Main Stand is in the background.]]
The first game at the ground was against United Services, [[Portsmouth]], with [[Coventry R.F.C.]] losing 13-3.
The biggest crowd at the ground was reputedly 18,000 for an England versus Wales School's International on 12 March 1939.
In the modern era, just over 8,000 people attended the [[National Division One|National League One]] match between [[Coventry R.F.C.]] and [[Newcastle Falcons|Newcastle]] on 2 November 1996, which was a record for the league until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-union-harris-has-the-drop-on-tough-newcastle-1350637.html |title=Rugby Union: Harris has the drop on tough Newcastle |publisher=The Independent |date=4 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thesouthstandchoir.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/falcons-in-division-two-199697/ |title=Falcons in Division Two 1996/97 |publisher=thesouthstandchoir.wordpress.com |date=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium had two stands; the Main (Road) Stand and the terraced Cowshed, though additional temporary structures were put in place for some representative games at the ground. The two stands only had minor alterations in their 83 years of existence. However, a clubhouse was opened in 1959, next to the Main Stand.

Their final game at the ground was a 34-20 victory for [[Coventry R.F.C.]] against [[Manchester R.F.C.]] on 2004-04-17, with an attendance of 2,200. Coventry R.F.C moved to the [[Butts Park Arena]] in September of that year, with the old stadium being demolished during November. The site has now been developed as a [[housing estate]] by Bryant Homes. Apartment houses on the site are named after former [[Coventry R.F.C.]] players including [[David Duckham]], Bert Godwin and Peter Jackson.

'''Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range''' is a [[shooting range]] in [[New Delhi]]. Spread over 72 acres, it is situated on [[South Delhi]] ridges in the backdrop of Adilabad Fort, near the historic [[Tughlaqabad Fort]] to its North and [[Surajkund]] Lake to its South West. It was first constructed for the [[1982 Asian Games]] in New Delhi, and later rebuild altogether for the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]]. It was named after Dr. [[Karni Singh]] who won the silver medal at the 38th [[World Shooting Championships]] at Cairo in 1962 and was the first shooter to be awarded the [[Arjuna Award]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=cwg&gt;[http://d2010.thecgf.com/dr_karni_singh_shooting_range Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range] [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstruction work started on 25 October 2008 and the project was completed at a cost of Rs. 150 crore in 13 months. It was dedicated to the nation on 31 January 2010 by Union Minister for Youth Affairs &amp; Sports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsauthorityofindia.nic.in/index2.asp?slid=567&amp;sublinkid=294&amp;langid=1 Dr. Karni Singh shooting range launched by Union Sports Minister Dr.M.S.Gill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315134142/http://www.sportsauthorityofindia.nic.in/index2.asp?slid=567&amp;sublinkid=294&amp;langid=1 |date=15 March 2013 }} [[Sports Authority of India]], February 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In October 2008 the structure of the range was fully demolished and was built under a project a plan costing Rs. 150 crore (U$33.8 m), it was completed in 13 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Game For The Show |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?264891 |date=12 April 2010  |publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spread over {{convert|72|acre|m2}}, the Range has been divided into six parts — a 10-metre range, a 25-metre range, a 50-metre range, a final range, trap and skeet range and a new armoury building which were constructed with state-of-the-art technology . The earlier separate ranges for Trap and Skeet were converted into new composite ranges for Trap and Skeet with scoring equipment.

For the 10-metre shooting range, a centrally air-conditioned indoor facility with complete power back-up was constructed with a capacity of maximum of 500 spectators. Two different grids will be providing electricity to ensure complete power back-up.

The trap and skeet range is an outdoor venue with only the seating area covered; the shooter though has shade on his head. There are 50 firing points for this range.

The rebuilding of the site was followed by massive plantation and beautification would to make the site more attractive. There are also plans for constructing a 200-seated hostel which will be a self-contained facility to help the campers.

It is regarded as one of the world's best shooting range by various [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] shooters.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgdelhi2010.org/news/foreign_shooters_awe_dr_karni_singh_shooting_range Foreign shooters in awe of Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range] [[2010 Commonwealth Games]], 9 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; also near by is the [[Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary]].

It was home to the [[United States Military Academy grounds and facilities#Athletic facilities|United States Military Academy]]'s [[Army Black Knights men's basketball]] team until [[Christl Arena]] opened in 1985.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{harvnb|ESPN|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Gillis Field House is the home of the Black Knights' track and field and volleyball teams. Gillis Field House is fully equipped with locker rooms for both teams and also features coaches offices and a fully equipped training room.

Gillis Field House is named for Maj. William G. Gillis. As a member of the West Point Class of 1941,  cadet lieutenant Gillis was captain of the 1940 football team and a three-year track letterman. He was killed in action October 1, 1944 in Gremercy Forest in France during WW II. When he died, Gillis was married to Lenore Riley Mudge. Gillis received the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts, as well as the British Distinguished Service Order, and France’s Croix De Guerre, Silver Gilt and Vermillion Star.

Located within Gills Field House, Crowell Track is the home of Army's indoor track &amp; field team. Crowell track features a six-lane (eight on the straightaway), 200-meter, mondo-surface oval track. This lightning-fast track incorporates the same surface as the tracks used in the Atlanta and Sydney Olympic Games. The facility is also equipped with two jumping pits, mondo pole vault runway with new UCS 1900 landing system and a mondo high jump apron with UCS landing mats. There is an indoor throwing cage and sector, as well as throwing nets to allow for discus and hammer practice.

Carleton R. Crowell took over the reins of the Army track and field program in 1952 and continued Army's long string of success on the track. One of the most beloved coaches at West Point, Crowell guided Army teams to 351 victories and a dozen Heptagonal championships - five indoors, three outdoors and four in cross country. All but one indoor and outdoor track and field record was shattered during his 25-year tenure.

During baseball and softball's offseason period, spacious Gillis Field House transforms into the Black Knights' part-time diamond. The recently renovated field house features a Beynon track surface, three indoor pitching mounds, two pitching machines, batting cages, and a fully equipped weight room.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goarmysports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=11100&amp;ATCLID=324131&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Headingley Rugby Stadium''', (known as '''Emerald Headingley Stadium''' due to sponsorship), shares the same site as [[Headingley Cricket Ground]] and is home to both [[Leeds Rhinos]] and [[Yorkshire Carnegie]] rugby teams. Headingley is also the [[List of Rugby League stadiums in England|5th largest rugby league stadium in England]].

==History==

===1889-1980s: Construction and development===
Leeds St. Johns, who were later to become Leeds Rugby League Football Club then [[Leeds Rhinos]], moved to Headingley in 1889 and built Headingley stadium. Headingley hosted [[rugby league]]'s first ever [[Challenge Cup]] Final in 1897.

In the 1930s, major developments took place on two sides of the rugby ground. The South Stand was completed in 1931, with some of the work being carried out by club players, while the old wooden North Stand was burned down during a match against Halifax on 25 March 1932. By the end of 1932, a new North Stand had been completed. The record attendance at Headingley was 40,175 for the rugby league match between Leeds and [[Bradford Northern]] on 21 May 1947. Undersoil heating was installed in 1963 but has since been removed due to ongoing problems, and [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlight]]s were installed in 1966. The [[1970 Rugby League World Cup Final]] between [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] and [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] was played at the stadium before a crowd of 18,776.

The third and deciding Test of the [[The Ashes (rugby league)|1978 Ashes series]] was played at Headingley before a crowd of 30,604.

===1990s–2000: Rugby Union and World Cup games===
New changing rooms were added in 1991, the same year [[Yorkshire Carnegie|Leeds RFU]] were founded and moved into Headingley. In July 1998, [[Leeds Carnegie|Leeds RFU]] became part of the world's first dual-code rugby partnership, Leeds Rugby Limited.

Headingley only hosted one match of the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup]], held in England and Wales to celebrate the centenary of rugby league in England. Host nation [[England national rugby league team|England]] defeated rugby league minnows [[South Africa national rugby league team|South Africa]] 46–0 in front of 14,041 fans.

Two matches of the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup]] were held at Headingley which included [[England national rugby league team|England]] v [[Fiji national rugby league team|Fiji]] which England won by 66–10 in front of a crowd of 10,052 and latterly the quarter final fixture between England and [[Ireland national rugby league team|Ireland]] which England won by 26–16 and attracted 15,405 spectators.

===2001–2006: East Stand Expansion and redevelopment===
In 2001 capacity was increased marginally by extending the terracing around the corner in between the Western Terraces and the North Stand.

Since 2005 Headingley rugby stadium has been the venue for the annual [[Varsity match|varsity]] rugby union match between [[Leeds Beckett University]] and the [[University of Leeds]] which has attracted over 11,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leedsvarsity.com/ LeedsVarsity.com] retrieved 20 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

2005 also saw the construction of the Carnegie Stand, built to replace the Eastern Terrace. The new stand had two tiers with 1,844 seats and hospitality suites. It was opened on 1 September 2006 for the [[Super League]] match between [[Leeds Rhinos]] and [[Warrington Wolves]].

===2012–2015: More international games===
The [[2012 World Club Challenge]] saw the first time that the stadium was fully packed to its capacity when the home team, and [[Super League XVI]] Champions, [[Leeds Rhinos]] took on the [[2011 NRL season|2011 NRL]] winners the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]]. 21,062 turned out to see the Rhinos defeat Manly 26–12, the game being highlighted by [[Ryan Hall (rugby league)|Ryan Hall]]'s 90 metre intercept try midway through the first half.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-club-challenge-2012/leeds-vs-manly-warringah.html 2012 World Club Challenge at Rugby League Project]&lt;/ref&gt; This saw Leeds gain some revenge for their 28–20 loss to Manly in the [[2009 World Club Challenge]] at [[Elland Road]].

The stadium hosted two matches of the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup]]: a Group B game featuring [[New Zealand Kiwis|New Zealand]], the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup|defending World Cup Champions]], and [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] on Friday 8 November which the Kiwis won 56–10 in front of an audience of 18,180. Headingley also hosted a Quarter-final game on Friday 15 November between New Zealand and [[Scotland national rugby league team|Scotland]] which New Zealand won by 40–4 to a crowd of 16,207.

In 2015 Headingley hosted [[New Zealand Kiwis|New Zealand]] again for the first time since 2013 where they took on [[Leeds Rhinos]] as a warm up for their [[2015 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain|test series]] against England. It also marked 120 years of rugby league being played at the stadium.

===2016–present: Major redevelopment===
In 2015 it was announced that the North and South stands were to be rebuilt as part of the redevelopment of the stadium. The new North stand will include new changing rooms and hospitality for both the cricket and rugby ground, with the cricket side having three tiers. The South Stand will also be rebuilt as it was condemned in 2011 with plans since then to rebuild the stand. The new South stand will have the same standing capacity and will also house seating due to the North stand being slightly reduced and will have a similar design as the Carnegie Stand.

Work on the new South Stand began in 2017, with the old structure demolished in September of that year. The stand is due to be open for the 2019 season.

==Layout==

===Emerald North Stand===
'''Capacity- 3,825 (seated)'''&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Headingley north stand construction 2018.jpg|thumb|Headingley North Stand Unser construction]]
The North Stand is the main stand in the ground and backs onto the cricket stadium. The stand also houses the changing rooms as well as the media and journalists and a bankqueting suite that is shared by both the cricket and rugby grounds.

===Carnegie Stand===
[[File:Headingley Carnegie.jpg|thumb|right|Carnegie Stand]]
'''Capacity- 4,550 (1,844 seated)'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Carnegie Stand was completed in 2006 and replaced the Eastern Terrace. The stand has two tiers; the bottom contained terracing whilst the top contains seating, hospitality boxes, bars and a restrauant.

===South Stand===
'''Capacity- 7,721 (2,217 seated)'''
The South Stand is well known in rugby league for being the ''Kop'' of the ground. The stand was rebuilt in 2018 and contains two tiers, the bottom tier is terracing and the upper tier is seating. The stand also contains the TV gauntry.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Western Terrace===
[[File:Leeds v Huddersfield Western Terrace.jpg|thumb|right|Headingley Western Terrace]]
'''Capacity- 4,966 '''&lt;br /&gt;
The Western Terrace is the only part of the stadium not covered and houses the away fans. It is the only part of the ground that has had no major redevelopment nor are there any plans to. It also contains the scoreboard and [[Sky Sports]] video board.

===Redevelopment===
In 2015 it was announced that the North and South stands were to be rebuilt as part of the redevelopment of the stadium. The new North stand will include new changing rooms and hospitality for both the cricket and rugby ground, with the cricket side having three tiers. The South Stand will also be rebuilt as it was condemned in 2011 with plans since then to rebuild the stand. The new South stand will have the same standing capacity and will also house seating due to the North stand being slightly reduced and will have the same design as the Carnegie Stand.

The only side of the ground that has not been redeveloped or are there any plans to do so is the Western Terrace due to there being a public right of way and housing behind it. The biggest change to the Western Terrace is the permanent video board in the South West corner which replaced the temporary one in the North West corner.

The '''Kids To The Country''' (KTC) is an American non-profit program that began in [[the Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]] by [[Plenty International]] to provide assistance to vulnerable and underprivileged children until conditions in the area improved enough to withdraw the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0GER/is_1999_Summer/ai_55127442 Whole Earth Article, 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041124064222/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0GER/is_1999_Summer/ai_55127442 |date=2004-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-established in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] in 1986, KTC is a program to reduce anger, violence and fear in some of the country's most at-risk urban children. Through various nature activities, the KTC program offers urban youth the opportunity to get out of troubled situations and develop a connection to nature. Summer programs are typically five weeks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellbenderpress.com/enter.pl?a=127 Hell Bender Press Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; and include swimming, riding canoes and horses, crafts, hiking and studying the native landscape, gardening, star gazing, playing musical instruments, and telling stories. 

A majority of the program's participants come from homeless shelters, refugee centers, and low-income neighborhoods. 

Over 2,800 children have participated since Plenty International's inception of the program. The program is hosted on [[The Farm (Tennessee)|The Farm Community]] in [[Summertown, Tennessee]] on {{convert|1750|acre|km2}} of wilderness.

'''Lakeside Stadium''' is a sports arena in [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]], [[Melbourne]], Australia. Comprising an [[athletics track]] and [[soccer]] [[stadium]], it currently serves as the home ground and administrative base for the [[South Melbourne FC]], [[Victorian Athletic League|Athletics Victoria]], [[Athletics Australia]], [[Victorian Institute of Sport]] and [[Little Athletics|Australian Little Athletics]].

The venue was built on the site of the former [[Australian rules football]] and [[cricket]] ground, '''Lake Oval''' (or '''South Melbourne Cricket Ground'''). It served for more than a century as the home ground of the [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne Football Club]] and the [[South Melbourne Cricket Club]], although it was also used for soccer from at least 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neososmos.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/victorian-soccer-fixtures-and-results_9713.html|title=Victorian Soccer Fixtures and Results 1883|work=Neos Osmos|author=Syson, Ian|date=30 September 2013|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of four sporting facilities in Melbourne - the others being the [[Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre]] (MSAC), the MSAC Institute of Training (MIT) and the [[State Netball and Hockey Centre]] (SNHC) - to be organised under the banner of '''Melbourne Sports Hub'''.

==History==

===The Lake Oval and Australian rules football===
[[File:Old lake oval grandstand.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1926 grandstand prior to Lakeside Stadium redevelopment]]
In its original oval configuration, the [[Lake Oval]] served most prominently as the home ground for [[Australian rules football]] club [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]], in both the [[Victorian Football Association]] and the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]]. In its early days, the ground was considered one of the best in the league, and was the venue for the [[1901 VFL Grand Final]]. South Melbourne used the ground for home games until the end of the [[1981 VFL season]], when the club relocated to [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]] and became the [[Sydney Swans]]. The last senior VFL match played at Lake Oval was on Saturday, 29 August 1981, when South Melbourne was defeated by 33 points against [[North Melbourne]] in front of 8484 fans. The club continued to use Lake Oval for reserves matches for several years after 1981.

When electric floodlighting was installed at the venue during the 1950s, it became one of the first venues in Melbourne to regularly host night football matches, including the [[List of Australian Football League pre-season and night series premiers|night premiership series]] between 1956 and 1971. Night premiership matches in the [[Victorian Football Association]] in [[1957 VFA season|1957]] and [[1958 VFA season|1958]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne|date=2 April 1957|title=Lone V.F.A. club's 'no' to night football|page=47|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and night interstate matches,&lt;ref name="VFASA"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|date=24 July 1957|title=Burst by S.A. crushes V.F.A.|page=45|publication-place=Melbourne|author=Carrick, Noel}}&lt;/ref&gt; including many matches at the [[1958 Melbourne Carnival|1958 Interstate Carnival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|date=3 July 1958|title=Big men pave way for WA|page=38|publication-place=Melbourne|author=Bretland, Bernie}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also held at the Lake Oval.

The ground record crowd for Lake Oval was set on 30 July [[1932 VFL season|1932]] when 41,000 turned out to see [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] defeat South Melbourne by nine points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/crowds/vn_lake_oval.html|title=Lake Oval - Attendances (1921-1981)|work=AFL Tables|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Aerial view of Albert Park Lake and the South Melbourne Cricket Ground in the foreground with a football match in progress.jpeg|thumb|Aerial photo of the South Melbourne cricket ground with a football match in progress.]]

For a time during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the struggling [[Fitzroy Football Club]] used the ground as a training and administrative base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;docID=news930722_0196_0533|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne|author=Linnell, Stephen|page=28|date=23 July 1993|title=Lion members back move to Western Oval|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old Xaverians Football Club]] of the [[Victorian Amateur Football Association]] was based there in 1993 and 1994. The oval was home to the [[South Melbourne Cricket Club]] during the summer.

A remnant of the old Lake Oval structure, a grandstand built in 1926, still remains standing at the venue. It had not been used for several years, and had fallen into disrepair. Its continued existence was the subject of debate. At one stage the [[Sydney Swans]] football club showed interest in repurchasing it to be used as a museum and administrative building, while there were also calls from others to demolish the building because of its derelict state. Under the re-modelling of the venue in 2011, the stand was refurbished to house the VIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majorprojects.vic.gov.au/our-projects/our-current-projects/state-sports-facilities|title=State Sports Facilities Project|publisher=Major Projects Victoria|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422202013/http://www.majorprojects.vic.gov.au/our-projects/our-current-projects/state-sports-facilities|archivedate=22 April 2011|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redevelopment===
Revelopment of the venue from an oval football/cricket stadium to the rectangular football stadium which became known as the Lakeside Stadium took place in 1995, when [[South Melbourne FC]] was forced out of its old home at [[Middle Park (stadium)|Middle Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |first1=Jennifer (presenter)|last1=Keyte|first2=Brendan (reporter)|last2=Donahoe|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLNxzPmb9s8 |title=Albert Park - The Track|access-date=5 July 2017 |series=Seven Nightly News |network=Seven Network |station=HSV Melbourne |date=29 May 1994|via=Argiri on YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was built with a capacity of 14,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/stadiums.php?id=15|title=Lakeside Stadium|work=Austadiums|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was achieved or approached several times in South Melbourne's history at the ground. A [[grandstand]] with an approximate capacity of 3,000 people was situated on one side, with a social club, reception centre and administrative facilities built in, while the other three sides of the ground consisted of open terraces with wooden seats. At one stage, a second two tiered stand for the outer side was proposed, but only preliminary plans were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/redevelopment/bobjane.php|title=Bob Jane Stadium Redevelopment|work=Austadiums|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517062046/http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/redevelopment/bobjane.php|archivedate=17 May 2008|accessdate=5 July 2017}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as being the home of South Melbourne FC, the venue also hosted games by the [[Socceroos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Thomas|last1=Esamie|first2=Greg|last2=Stock|first3=Jean-Michel|last3=Cazal|first4=Frank|last4=Scicluna|url=http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Socceroo/1996A.html|title=Socceroo Internationals for 1996|work=OzFootball|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia national under-20 football team|Young Socceroos]], Australia's national women's team the [[Australia women's national soccer team|Matildas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Esamie|first=Thomas|url=http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Matildas/2006A.html|title=Matildas Internationals for 2006|work=OzFootball|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grand finals and finals matches of the [[Victorian Premier League]] (now National Premier Leagues Victoria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Punshon|first=John|url=http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2006VCR.html|title=2006 Vodafone Cup Results|work=OzFootball|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletics venue===
In May 2008, the State Government announced that Lakeside Stadium would undergo a major redevelopment, in order to accommodate an athletics track, as part of moving Athletics Victoria from [[Olympic Park, Melbourne|Olympic Park]]. The [[Victorian Institute of Sport]], Athletics Victoria and [[South Melbourne FC]] would share tenancy of the venue. Major Projects Victoria committed $60 million to the project. South Melbourne played its final match under Lakeside Stadium's previous configuration in April 2010, and construction work on the remodelled venue began in June 2010.

The synthetic 8-lane athletics track was constructed to international [[IAAF]] standards. A 6-lane 60 metre warm-up track was also constructed. The remodelling also saw a [[FIFA]]-sized natural grass soccer pitch, a new electronic scoreboard, upgraded lighting, a new northern stand and new spectator amenities. The old grandstand was also renovated to accommodate offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msac.com.au/sites/default/files/SSFP%20project%20profile%20WEB.pdf|title=State Sports Facilities Project Profile|publisher=Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, the stadium hosted the [[Melbourne Track Classic]].

The venue is operated by the State Sports Centre Trust, the operators of the [[Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre]] and the [[State Netball and Hockey Centre]].

The use of [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|performance-enhancing drugs]] (doping) is prohibited within the sport of [[athletics (sport)|athletics]]. Athletes who are found to have used such banned substances, whether through a positive drugs test, the [[biological passport]] system, an investigation or public admission, may receive a competition [[Ban (law)|ban]] for a length of time which reflects the severity of the infraction. Athletes who are found to have banned substances in their possession, or who tamper with or refuse to submit to drug testing can also receive bans from the sport. Competitive bans may also be given to athletes who test positive for prohibited [[recreational drugs]] or stimulants with little performance-enhancing effect for competitors in athletics. The sports body responsible for determining which substances are banned in athletics is the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA).

Typically, any athlete who tests positive for banned substances after having served a previous ban receives a lifetime ban from the sport of athletics. Many high-profile sportspeople to receive doping bans have come from the sport of athletics, with significant past cases concerning [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]], [[Marion Jones]] and [[Tim Montgomery]]. Furthermore, a number of athletes who underwent state-sponsored [[Doping in East Germany|doping programmes in East Germany]] between the 1960s and 1980s were competitors in athletics, but the quality of the international anti-doping work was so poor that only one East German athlete ever tested positive.&lt;ref name=Berendonk/&gt; Following allegations of state-sponsored [[doping in Russia]], the IAAF suspended the country's athletes from competition, including the 2016 Summer Olympics.

This was the third movie that paired Williams and Ricardo Montalbán, the other two being ''[[Fiesta (1947 film)|Fiesta]]'' (1947) and ''[[On an Island with You]]'' (1948), and the second to co-star Red Skelton (after 1944's ''[[Bathing Beauty]]''). This is one of the first films to depict [[television]] use.

==Plot summary==
Although she initially rejects an offer by Joe Backett to become his business partner at the Neptune swimming suit design company, aquatic ballet dancer Eve Barrett changes her mind when she considers the publicity potential of the job. One day, Joe learns that a South American polo team will be playing a big match in town, and he and Eve begin planning a swimming spectacle for the event. Eve tells her man-crazy sister and roommate Betty about the South American team, and Betty immediately seizes upon the idea of finding herself a date among the players. Meanwhile, Jose O'Rourke, the handsome playboy captain of the polo team, seeks relief for his injured arm from Jack Spratt, a bumbling masseur, who complains to Jose about his lack of success with women. During the massage, Jose gives Jack advice on how to attract women, stressing the importance of speaking to women in Spanish, which he calls the "language of love." Later, while looking for the famed South American team captain, Betty accidentally mistakes Jack for Jose. Jack does not reveal his identity to Betty and accepts her invitation to visit her at her house.

On their date, Jack secretly plays a Spanish language instruction record while pretending that he is speaking romantic Spanish phrases to Betty. At the end of the evening, Betty tells Eve about her date, and Eve tries to dissuade her from pursuing a romance with any of the visiting polo players. The following day, while giving a tour of the Neptune bathing suit factory, Eve meets Jose and warns him to stay away from her sister. Jose is confused by the warning but because he is attracted to Eve, he pretends to understand and agrees to break his presumed date with Betty. When Jose asks Eve to go on the date with him, she reluctantly consents and does so only to prevent him from pursuing her sister. Despite her best attempts to make her date with Jose a failure, Eve finds him attractive and enjoys her evening. Confusion abounds the following day, when Eve's maid, Matilda, tells her that Betty has gone on another date with Jose. Furious at the news, Eve goes to Jose's apartment and demands to see her sister. She searches Jose's apartment to no avail and does not understand why Betty is not there. Later, when crooked nightclub owner Lukie Luzette learns that a man named Jose is the polo team's most valuable player, he decides to kidnap Jose and keep him out of the game to ensure that his bet against his team will pay off. Lukie sends one of his henchmen to abduct Jose, but the henchman mistakenly abducts Jack instead. Jose, meanwhile, proposes marriage to Eve, and she, having found no evidence of further wrongdoings, accepts.

However, just as Eve is about to tell Betty that she intends to marry Jose, Betty informs her that she and Jose are now engaged. When Jose shows up at Eve and Betty's house, Eve, convinced that he has deceived her, shuts the door in his face. Moments later, Jose is abducted by Lukie's men and placed in captivity. Jack, meanwhile, manages to escape from his captors just as the big polo match begins. Betty, who still believes that Jack is Jose, insists that he save his team from defeat and helps him mount a horse. While Jack inadvertently scores a victory for the South American team, the police find Jose and free him. Jose arrives at the polo field in time to accept the team's trophy and to clear up Eve's confusion. Jack admits to Betty that he is an impostor, but she forgives him and assures him of her love. All ends happily as a double wedding is planned for both couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neptune's Daughter|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=26038|website=AFI: Catalogue of Feature Films|publisher=American Film Institute|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams discovered she was pregnant with her first child with husband [[Ben Gage]] early into shooting.&lt;ref name="The Million Dollar Mermaid"&gt;The Million Dollar Mermaid: An Autobiography, By Esther Williams, Digby Diehl, Published by Harcourt Trade, 2000, {{ISBN|0-15-601135-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-15-601135-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams contracted with Cole of California to appear as their spokesperson before making the film. As a result, the company created the suits that Williams and the aqua chorus wore throughout the film. After filming was done, Williams's doctor ordered her to stay away from activity, and she instead gave swimming lessons to blind children. "Teaching those children how to swim was "one of the most gratifying experiences I've ever had," wrote Williams in her autobiography.&lt;ref name="The Million Dollar Mermaid"/&gt;

Williams played a swimsuit designer in this film, and went on to copy several swimsuit designs from this film in the line of swimwear she would later create.&lt;ref name="The Million Dollar Mermaid"/&gt;

==Musical numbers==
The song "[[Baby It's Cold Outside]]"  was not planned to be in this film. It took the place of [[Frank Loesser]]'s "[[(I'd Like to Get You on a) Slow Boat to China]]," which the Hayes Office thought inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slow Boat To China|url=http://www.pianomanslc.com/Lyrics/S/Slow%20Boat%20to%20China.htm|website=Piano Man SLC|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;noinclude&gt;'''&lt;/noinclude&gt;{{no selflink|neurobiological effects of physical exercise}}&lt;noinclude&gt;'''&lt;/noinclude&gt; are numerous and involve a wide range of interrelated effects on brain structure, brain function, and [[cognition]].&lt;ref name="Summary as of August 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Erickson KI, Hillman CH, Kramer AF|title=Physical activity, brain, and cognition|journal=Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences|date=August 2015|volume=4|pages=27–32|doi=10.1016/j.cobeha.2015.01.005 | quote = &lt;!--Research in children finds that higher fit and more active preadolescent children show greater hippocampal and basal ganglia volume, greater white matter integrity, elevated and more efficient patterns of brain activity, and superior cognitive performance and scholastic achievement. Higher fit and more physically active older adults show greater hippocampal, prefrontal cortex, and basal ganglia volume, greater functional brain connectivity, greater white matter integrity, more efficient brain activity, and superior executive and memory function.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;''Cognitive performance'': Cross-sectional, observational, and randomized clinical trials of PA in late adulthood have demonstrated that engaging in PA may preserve and/or enhance cognitive function even in cognitively impaired individuals (e.g., [18]). Summaries of these studies can now be found in several meta-analyses, most of which confirm that PA positively influences cognitive function in late adulthood with small to moderate sized effects [19]. In a meta-analysis of 18 randomized PA trials, engaging in moderate intensity PA resulted in enhanced cognitive function across all cognitive domains examined, but with the largest effect sizes for indices of executive function [20]. Meta-analyses of longitudinal observational studies have also confirmed that self-reported engagement in PA is associated with nearly a 40% reduced risk of experiencing cognitive decline over several years [21]. These, and other studies, make a convincing argument that both continuing to engage in, and starting to engage in, PA in late adulthood may have a profound effect on maintaining cognitive health, improving function, and reducing the risk of developing cognitive impairment.&lt;br /&gt;''Brain structure'': There have been now more than 30 published studies of PA or fitness on brain structure in older adults (&gt;60 years) with the majority showing positive associations (see [22]). Such effects are important since increasing age is associated with brain atrophy and loss of volume, which precedes and predicts conversion to dementia. Higher aerobic fitness levels have been associated with larger gray matter volumes in older adults in several areas including the frontal cortex [23,24], hippocampus [25,26], and caudate nucleus [27]. Longitudinal observational studies have also shown that greater amounts of PA are associated with larger gray matter volumes in these regions, and greater volume is, in turn, associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment [28]. These cross-sectional and observational results in older adults are further supported by clinical trials that have shown that six-months to one-year of regular PA is associated with an increase in both frontal cortex [29&lt;sup&gt;••&lt;/sup&gt;,30] and hippocampal volume&amp;nbsp;... These effects on gray matter volume are accompanied by differences found in white matter integrity. For example, several studies have reported that higher cardiorespiratory fitness levels and PA are associated with greater white matter integrity along several tracts linking frontal and subcortical areas [34–36] and that greater changes in fitness after an intervention was associated with an increase in white matter integrity [37]. In sum, there is now convincing evidence that PA and fitness influence brain structure, characterized by both gray matter volume and white matter integrity, in late adulthood.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Exercise - neurotrophic factors + basal ganglia"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paillard T, Rolland Y, de Souto Barreto P | title = Protective Effects of Physical Exercise in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease: A Narrative Review | journal = J Clin Neurol | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 212–219 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26174783 | pmc = 4507374 | doi = 10.3988/jcn.2015.11.3.212 | quote = Aerobic physical exercise (PE) activates the release of neurotrophic factors and promotes angiogenesis, thereby facilitating neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, which in turn improve memory and cognitive functions.&amp;nbsp;...

Regular engagement in physical exercise enhances cognitive functioning, increases brain neurotrophic proteins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and prevents cognitive diseases [76–78]. Recent findings highlight a role for aerobic exercise in modulating chromatin remodelers [21, 79–82].&amp;nbsp;... These results were the first to demonstrate that acute and relatively short aerobic exercise modulates epigenetic modifications. The transient epigenetic modifications observed due to chronic running training have also been associated with improved learning and stress-coping strategies, epigenetic changes and increased c-Fos-positive neurons&amp;nbsp;... Nonetheless, these studies demonstrate the existence of epigenetic changes after acute and chronic exercise and show they are associated with improved cognitive function and elevated markers of neurotrophic factors and neuronal activity (BDNF and c-Fos).&amp;nbsp;... The aerobic exercise training-induced changes to miRNA profile in the brain seem to be intensity-dependent [164]. These few studies provide a basis for further exploration into potential miRNAs involved in brain and neuronal development and recovery via aerobic exercise.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large body of research in humans has demonstrated that consistent [[aerobic exercise]] (e.g., 30&amp;nbsp;minutes every day) induces persistent improvements in certain [[cognitive function]]s, healthy alterations in [[gene expression]] in the brain, and beneficial forms of [[neuroplasticity]] and [[behavioral plasticity]]; some of these long-term effects include: increased [[adult neurogenesis|neuron growth]], increased neurological activity (e.g., {{nowrap|[[c-Fos]]}} and [[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]] signaling), improved stress coping, enhanced [[cognitive control of behavior]], improved [[declarative memory|declarative]], [[spatial memory|spatial]], and [[working memory|working]] memory, and structural and functional improvements in brain structures and [[neural pathways|pathways]] associated with cognitive control and memory.&lt;ref name="Summary as of August 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Exercise - neurotrophic factors + basal ganglia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Summary of effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="epigenome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Comprehensive review"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Gomez-Pinilla F, Hillman C | title = The influence of exercise on cognitive abilities | journal = Compr.

Normal aging results in the loss of brain tissue (31), with markedly larger tissue loss evidenced in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices (16, 58, 149). As such, cognitive functions subserved by these brain regions (such as those involved in cognitive control and memory) are expected to decay more dramatically than other aspects of cognition. Specifically, age-related decreases in gray matter volume have been associated with decrements in a variety of cognitive control processes.&amp;nbsp;... Decreases in gray matter volume may result from several factors including loss in the number of neurons, neuronal shrinkage, reduction in dendritic arborization, and alterations in glia (158). Further, decreases in white matter (brain tissue composed primarily of myelinated nerve fibers) volume, which represent changes in connectivity between neurons, also occur as a result of aging. Loss of white matter volume further relates to performance decrements on a host of cognitive tasks&amp;nbsp;... aerobic fitness relates to larger hippocampal volume (23) and better relational memory performance (24), during preadolescent childhood.&amp;nbsp;... Specifically, those assigned to the aerobic training group demonstrated increases in gray matter in the frontal lobes, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supplementary motor area, middle frontal gyrus, dorsolateral region of the right inferior frontal gyrus, and the left superior temporal lobe (32). White matter volume changes were also evidenced for the aerobic fitness group with increases in white matter tracts within the anterior third of the corpus callosum (32).&amp;nbsp;...  In addition, aerobic fitness has been shown to promote better functioning of brain, especially in neural networks involved in cognitive control of inhibition and attention (33).&amp;nbsp;... In addition to BDNF, the actions of IGF-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (54) are considered essential for the angiogenic and neurogenic effects of exercise in the brain.&amp;nbsp;...

Meta-analyses (Colcombe and Kramer, 2003; Smith et al., 2010) suggest that the effects of exercise on the brain might not be uniform across all regions and that some brain areas, specifically those areas supporting executive functions, might be more influenced by participation in exercise than areas not as critically involved in executive functions.&amp;nbsp;... The effects appear to be general in the sense that many different cognitive domains are improved after several months of aerobic exercise, but specific in the sense that executive functions are improved more than other cognitive domains.&amp;nbsp;... physical activity and exercise may reduce the risk for AD (Barnes and Yaffe, 2011; Podewils et al., 2005; Sofi et al., 2011)&amp;nbsp;...

(2010) reported that greater amounts of physical activity were associated with greater gray matter volume 9-years later in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, parietal cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus.&amp;nbsp;... higher fitness levels (VO2max) were associated with larger hippocampal volumes, better executive function, and faster processing speed.&amp;nbsp;...  Verstynen et al. (2012) examined the association between cardiorespiratory fitness levels (VO2max) and the size of the basal ganglia&amp;nbsp;... Verstynen et al. (2012) found that higher fitness levels were associated with greater volume of the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens, and in turn, greater volumes were associated with better performance on a task-switching paradigm.&amp;nbsp;... That is, higher physical activity levels mitigated the detrimental effects of lifetime stress on the size of the hippocampus.&amp;nbsp;... The few randomized interventions published thus far have found results highly overlapping with the cross-sectional studies and suggest that the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus remain pliable in late life and that moderate intensity exercise for 6 months–1 year is sufficient for changing the size of these areas.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="exercise benefits"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guiney H, Machado L | title = Benefits of regular aerobic exercise for executive functioning in healthy populations | journal = Psychon Bull Rev | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–86 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23229442 | doi = 10.3758/s13423-012-0345-4 | quote = &lt;!--Executive functions are strategic in nature and depend on higher-order cognitive processes that underpin planning, sustained attention, selective attention, resistance to interference, volitional inhibition, working memory, and mental flexibility&amp;nbsp;... Data to date from studies of aging provide strong evidence of exercise-linked benefits related to task switching, selective attention, inhibition of prepotent responses, and working memory capacity; furthermore, cross-sectional fitness data suggest that working memory updating could potentially benefit as well. In young adults, working memory updating is the main executive function shown to benefit from regular exercise, but cross-sectional data further suggest that task-switching and post-error performance may also benefit. In children, working memory capacity has been shown to benefit, and cross-sectional data suggest potential benefits for selective attention and inhibitory control.&amp;nbsp;... Support for the idea that higher levels of aerobic activity may be associated with superior brain structure has been gained through cross-sectional studies in older adults and children (for a recent review, see Voss, Nagamatsu, et al., 2011).&amp;nbsp;... only those in the aerobic exercise group exhibited improved connectivity between the left and right prefrontal cortices, two areas that are crucial to the effective functioning of the fronto-executive network.&amp;nbsp;... Together, these studies provide evidence that regular aerobic exercise benefits control over responses during selective attention in older adults.&amp;nbsp;... aerobic fitness is a good predictor of performance on tasks that rely relatively heavily on inhibitory control over prepotent responses (e.g., Colcombe et al., 2004, Study 1; Prakash et al., 2011) and also that regular aerobic exercise ''improves'' performance on such tasks&amp;nbsp;...

Considerable evidence shows that regular physical activity is associated with enhanced cognitive functions, including attention, processing speed, task switching, inhibition of prepotent responses and declarative memory (for reviews see Colcombe and Kramer, 2003; Smith et al., 2010; Guiney and Machado, 2013; McAuley et al., 2013).

In particular, several cross-sectional and intervention studies have shown a positive association between physical activity and cognition in older persons [86] and an inverse correlation with cognitive decline and dementia [87]. Older adults enrolled in a 6-month aerobic fitness intervention increased brain volume in both gray matter (anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, posterior middle frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal lobe) and white matter (anterior third of corpus callosum) [88]. In addition, Colcombe and colleagues showed that older adults with higher cardiovascular fitness levels are better at activating attentional resources, including decreased activation of the anterior cingulated cortex. One of the possible mechanisms by which physical activity may benefit cognition is that physical activity maintains brain plasticity, increases brain volume, stimulates neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, and increases neurotrophic factors in different areas of the brain, possibly providing reserve against later cognitive decline and dementia [89, 90].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of affective state, acute exercise decreases negative affect, increases positive affect, and decreases the psychological and physiological response to acute stress [28]. These effects have been reported to persist for up to 24 hours after exercise cessation [28, 29, 53]. In terms of cognitive functioning, acute exercise primarily enhances executive functions dependent on the prefrontal cortex including attention, working memory, problem solving, cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, decision making, and inhibitory control [9]. These positive changes have been demonstrated to occur with very low to very high exercise intensities [9], with effects lasting for up to two hours after the end of the exercise bout (Fig. 1A) [27]. Moreover, many of these neuropsychological assessments measure several aspects of behavior including both accuracy of performance and speed of processing. McMorris and Hale performed a meta-analysis examining the effects of acute exercise on both accuracy and speed of processing, revealing that speed significantly improved post-exercise, with minimal or no effect on accuracy [17]. These authors concluded that increasing task difficulty or complexity may help to augment the effect of acute exercise on accuracy.&amp;nbsp;...

Evidence in transgenic mouse models of AD, in which the mice have artificially elevated amyloid load, suggests that exercise programs are able to improve cognitive function (Adlard et al., 2005; Nichol et al., 2007). Adlard and colleagues also determined that the improvement in cognitive performance occurred in conjunction with a reduced amyloid load. Research that includes direct indices of change in such biomarkers will help to determine the mechanisms by which exercise may act on cognition in AD.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alz 2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao AK, Chou A, Bursley B, Smulofsky J, Jezequel J | title = Systematic review of the effects of exercise on activities of daily living in people with Alzheimer's disease | journal = Am J Occup Ther | volume = 68 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–56 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24367955 | doi = 10.5014/ajot.2014.009035 | quote = Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by loss in cognitive function, abnormal behavior, and decreased ability to perform basic activities of daily living [(ADLs)]&amp;nbsp;...

====BDNF signaling====
&lt;!--The BDNF article links to the anchor/heading "BDNF signaling"--&gt;{{See also|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor}}
One of the most significant effects of exercise on the brain is the increased synthesis and expression of [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]], a [[neuropeptide]] [[peptide hormone|hormone]], in the brain and periphery, resulting in increased signaling through its [[receptor tyrosine kinase]], [[tropomyosin receptor kinase B]] (TrkB).&lt;ref name="epigenome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trophic factor signaling"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Phillips C, Baktir MA, Srivatsan M, Salehi A | title = Neuroprotective effects of physical activity on the brain: a closer look at trophic factor signaling | journal = Front Cell Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 170 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24999318 | pmc = 4064707 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2014.00170 | quote = &lt;!--Moreover, recent evidence suggests that myokines released by exercising muscles affect the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor synthesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a finding that could lead to the identification of new and therapeutically important mediating factors.&amp;nbsp;... Studies have demonstrated the intensity of exercise training is positively correlated with BDNF plasma levels in young, healthy individuals (Ferris et al., 2007). Resistance exercise has also been shown to elevate serum BDNF levels in young individuals (Yarrow et al., 2010). Moreover, it has been shown that moderate levels of physical activity in people with AD significantly increased plasma levels of BDNF (Coelho et al., 2014).&amp;nbsp;... In humans, it has been shown that 4 h of rowing activity leads to increased levels of plasma BDNF from the internal jugular (an indicator of central release from the brain) and radial artery (an indicator of peripheral release; Rasmussen et al., 2009). Seifert et al. (2010) reported that basal release of BDNF increases following 3 months endurance training in young and healthy individuals, as measured from the jugular vein. These trends are augmented by rodent studies showing that endurance training leads to increased synthesis of BDNF in the hippocampal formation (Neeper et al., 1995, 1996).&amp;nbsp;... Both BDNF and IGF-1 play a significant role in cognition and motor function in humans.&amp;nbsp;... Multiple large-scale studies in humans have shown that serum levels of IGF-1 are correlated with fitness and as well as body mass indices (Poehlman and Copeland, 1990). Furthermore, animal studies have shown that exercise in rats is associated with increased amounts of IGF-1 in the CSF.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Organ response"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heinonen I, Kalliokoski KK, Hannukainen JC, Duncker DJ, Nuutila P, Knuuti J | title = Organ-Specific Physiological Responses to Acute Physical Exercise and Long-Term Training in Humans | journal = Physiology | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 421–436 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25362636 | doi = 10.1152/physiol.00067.2013 | quote = &lt;!--The Effects of Acute Exercise&lt;br /&gt;Studies in humans and animals have shown that brain blood flow remains largely unchanged in response to acute exercise[,]&amp;nbsp;... does not increase with increasing exercise intensity[, and]&amp;nbsp;... increased metabolic demands of active brain parts are mostly met by redistributing oxygen supply, although changes in oxygen extraction may also contribute.

Specifically, IGF-1 increases progenitor cell proliferation and numbers of new neurons, oligodendrocytes, and blood vessels in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.

IGF-1 also reaches the brain via both the capillary bed BBB and via the blood-CSF barrier. It appears that IGF-1 uptake is mediated by a specific carrier both in the capillary bed BBB [40] and in the blood-CSF barrier [41, 42]. Moreover, IGF-1 transport across the BBB can be either increased, such as by exercise [43]&amp;nbsp;... Thus, although not fully characterized, there appear to be mechanisms for transport of both GH and IGF-1 across the BBB.&amp;nbsp;...

Investigations looking at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of cerebral blood volume in the hippocampus have demonstrated that exercise selectively increased the cerebral blood volume of the dentate gyrus, correlating with post-mortem increase in neurogenesis (Pereira et al. 2007). From a molecular perspective, elevated systemic levels of circulating growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in blood elicited by increased exercise have been shown to mediate, in part, enhancements in neurogenesis (Trejo et al. 2001; Fabel et al. 2003).

You can see the deleterious effects of stress, sadness, loneliness, and lack of physical health or fitness at the physiological and neuroanatomical level in prefrontal cortex and at the behavioral level in worse EFs (poorer reasoning and problem solving, forgetting things, and impaired ability to exercise discipline and self-control).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;EFs can be improved (Diamond &amp; Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).&amp;nbsp;...

Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one’s attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what’s more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we would be at the mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn’t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Attention-acute exercise"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Janssen M, Toussaint HM, van Mechelen W, Verhagen EA | title = Effects of acute bouts of physical activity on children's attention: a systematic review of the literature | journal = SpringerPlus | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 410 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25133092 | pmc = 4132441 | doi = 10.1186/2193-1801-3-410 | quote = There is weak evidence for the effect of acute bouts of physical activity on attention.&amp;nbsp;...

In the short term, activation of the HPA axis in response to stress is adaptive. However, long-term stress promoting chronic exposure of tissues to high cortisol concentrations becomes maladaptive.&amp;nbsp;... Exercise, particularly sustained aerobic activity, is a potent stimulus of cortisol secretion. The circulating concentrations of cortisol are directly proportional to the intensity of exercise as measured by oxygen uptake. As is the case for the GH/IGF-1 and HPG axes, the HPA axis also receives many other inputs, including the light/dark cycle, feeding schedules, immune regulation, and many neurotransmitters that mediate the effects of exercise and physical and psychic stress [52].&amp;nbsp;... The HPA is activated by stress, whether physical (exercise) or psychological.&amp;nbsp;... Thus, a negative net energy balance leads to activation of the HPA axis and the circulating concomitants of the catabolic state in an attempt to keep core processes functional, realizing that the stress of exercise has no effect on cortisol and circulating metabolic substrates beyond the impact of the exercise energy expenditure on energy availability [60]. Thuma et al. [61] had already made the important observation that the reported differences in cortisol levels pre- and post-exercise depended on whether this difference was measured from a single pre-test level or from the physiologic circadian baseline as determined in an independent session in the resting state. By this analytical technique, these investigators showed that increasing energy expenditure led to significant cortisol release. This release was apparent if they subtracted the physiologic circadian baseline from the post-exercise value.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Endocrine cognition" /&gt;  Short-term increases in cortisol levels are associated with adaptive cognitive improvements, such as enhanced inhibitory control;&lt;ref name="Fitness mechanism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Exercise neuroendocrine effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Endocrine cognition" /&gt; however, excessively high exposure or prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol causes impairments in cognitive control and has [[neurotoxic]] effects in the human brain.&lt;ref name="Fitness mechanism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Endocrine cognition"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebner NC, Kamin H, Diaz V, Cohen RA, MacDonald K | title = Hormones as "difference makers" in cognitive and socioemotional aging processes | journal = Front Psychol | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1595 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25657633 | pmc = 4302708 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01595 | quote = &lt;!-- It is known that chronically elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol exert neurotoxic effects on the aging brain with negative impacts on cognition and socioemotional functioning.&amp;nbsp;... Cortisol is a steroid hormone released by the HPA axis in response to challenging situations. As the primary effector of the biological stress response in humans, it is implicated in a diverse array of physiologic, metabolic, immunologic, and psychological processes directed toward successful coping (Sapolsky et al., 2000; Kassel and Herrlich, 2007). Cortisol receptors are well-represented in limbic structures involved in affective response (i.e., hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala) and in regions central to executive function such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (Dedovic et al., 2009; Joëls and Baram, 2009). As a result, the effects of cortisol extend beyond the stress and threat response system to impact mood, attention, and memory (Lupien and McEwen, 1997; Sapolsky et al., 2000; de Kloet et al., 2005).&amp;nbsp;... In contrast, evidence indicated positive associations between cortisol levels that were acutely elevated by stress or hydrocortisone administration and inhibitory control (Schlosser et al., 2013) as well as spatial learning (Meyer et al., 2013). Regarding cortisol’s effect on memory, the evidence is currently mixed (Schwabe et al., 2012; van Ast et al., 2013).&amp;nbsp;... There also is evidence that effects of cortisol on cognition vary in a dose-dependent fashion. In particular, there is evidence of cognitive improvements under conditions of moderate, time-limited cortisol elevation but evidence of cognitive impairments when cortisol concentrations are persistent or excessively high (Lupien et al., 1999; Abercrombie et al., 2003; Hupbach and Fieman, 2012; Schilling et al., 2013; Moriarty et al., 2014).--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, chronic psychological stress decreases {{abbr|BDNF|brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} expression which has detrimental effects on hippocampal volume and can lead to [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Fitness mechanism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-Stress" /&gt;

For example, Rimelle et al. [123] documented significantly lower cortisol and heart rate responses to psychosocial stress (Trier social stress test) in trained men compared with untrained men. Moreover, significantly greater calmness and better mood, and a trend towards lower state anxiety, were noted in these trained men during the stress protocol.&amp;nbsp;... Whereas hippocampal and/or serum/plasma BDNF levels are downregulated by chronic psychosocial stress and inflammation [138,180,201], central and peripheral BDNF levels can be upregulated by acute exercise [33,198,202,203].&amp;nbsp;... Exercise-induced increases in brain monoamines (norepinephrine and serotonin) may also contribute to increased expression of hippocampal BDNF [194]. In addition, other growth factors—insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor—have been shown to play an important role in BDNF-induced effects on neuroplasticity [33,172,190,192], as well as exerting neuroprotective effects of their own [33,214,215], thereby contributing to the beneficial effects of exercise on brain health.

Animal studies found EX-induced changes in different neurotransmitters such as serotonin and endorphins [10,11], which relate to mood, and positive effects of EX on stress reactivity (e.g., the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis [12,13]). Finally, anxiolytic effects of EX mediated by atrial natriuretic peptide have been reported [14].

Interestingly, the researchers reported that, independently of sex and age, dynamic anaerobic exercises increased β-endorphin, while resistance and aerobic exercises seem to only have small effects on β-endorphins.&amp;nbsp;... The results showed that mood tends to be higher in a day an individual exercises as well as that daily activity and exercise overall are strongly linked with mood states.  In line with these findings, a recent study showed that exercise significantly improved mood states in non-exercises, recreational exercisers, as well as marathon runners.  More importantly, the effects of exercise on mood were twofold in recreational exercisers and marathon runners.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta-analytic]] review found that exercise significantly increases the secretion of {{nowrap|β-endorphin}} and that this secretion is correlated with improved mood states.&lt;ref name="Endorphin" /&gt; Moderate intensity exercise produces the greatest increase in {{nowrap|β-endorphin}} synthesis, while higher and lower intensity forms of exercise are associated with smaller increases in {{nowrap|β-endorphin}} synthesis.&lt;ref name="Endorphin" /&gt; A review on {{nowrap|β-endorphin}} and exercise noted that an individual's mood improves for the remainder of the day following physical exercise and that one's mood is positively correlated with overall daily physical activity level.&lt;ref name="Endorphin" /&gt;

====Anandamide====

[[Anandamide]] is an [[endocannabinoid|endogenous cannabinoid]] neurotransmitter that binds to [[cannabinoid receptor]]s.&lt;ref name="endocannabinoids"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tantimonaco M, Ceci R, Sabatini S, Catani MV, Rossi A, Gasperi V, Maccarrone M | title = Physical activity and the endocannabinoid system: an overview | journal = Cell.

Indeed, direct and indirect evidence suggests that the ECS might mediate some of the PA-triggered effects throughout the body.&amp;nbsp;... the evidence that PA induces some of the psychotropic effects elicited by the Cannabis sativa active ingredient Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC, Fig. 1), like bliss, euphoria, and peacefulness, strengthened the hypothesis that endocannabinoids (eCBs) might mediate, at least in part, the central and peripheral effects of exercise [14].&amp;nbsp;... To our knowledge, the first experimental study aimed at investigating the influence of PA on ECS in humans was carried out in 2003 by Sparling and coworkers [63], who showed increased plasma AEA content after 45 min of moderate intensity exercise on a treadmill or cycle ergometer. Since then, other human studies have shown increased blood concentrations of AEA&amp;nbsp;... A dependence of the increase of AEA concentration on exercise intensity has also been documented. Plasma levels of AEA significantly increased upon 30 min of moderate exercise (heart rate of 72 and 83 %), but not at lower and significantly higher exercise intensities, where the age-adjusted maximal heart rate was 44 and 92 %, respectively&amp;nbsp;... Several experimental data support the hypothesis that ECS might, at least in part, explain PA effects on brain functions, because: (1) CB1 is the most abundant GPCR in the brain participating in neuronal plasticity [18]; (2) eCBs are involved in several brain responses that greatly overlap with the positive effects of exercise; (3) eCBs are able to cross the blood–brain barrier [95]; and (4) exercise increases {{abbr|eCB|endocannabinoid}} plasma levels [64–67].--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that aerobic exercise causes an increase in plasma anandamide levels, where the magnitude of this increase is highest at moderate exercise intensity ( i.e., exercising at ~⁠70⁠–⁠80⁠% maximum heart rate).&lt;ref name="endocannabinoids" /&gt; Increases in plasma anandamide levels are associated with [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive effects]] because anandamide is able to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] and act within the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="endocannabinoids" /&gt; Thus, because anandamide is a euphoriant and aerobic exercise is associated with euphoric effects, it has been proposed that anandamide partly mediates the short-term mood-lifting effects of exercise (e.g., the euphoria of a runner's high) via exercise-induced increases in its synthesis.&lt;ref name="Primary-Runner's high definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="endocannabinoids" /&gt;

A popular belief has been that endogenous endorphins mediate these beneficial effects. However, running exercise increases blood levels of both β-endorphin (an opioid) and anandamide (an endocannabinoid). Using a combination of pharmacologic, molecular genetic, and behavioral studies in mice, we demonstrate that cannabinoid receptors mediate acute anxiolysis and analgesia after running. We show that anxiolysis depends on intact cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) receptors on forebrain GABAergic neurons and pain reduction on activation of peripheral CB1 and CB2 receptors. We thus demonstrate that the endocannabinoid system is crucial for two main aspects of a runner's high. Sedation, in contrast, was not influenced by cannabinoid or opioid receptor blockage, and euphoria cannot be studied in mouse models. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{npsn|date=April 2016}}

Sibley and Etnier (2003) performed a meta-analysis that looked at the relationship between physical activity and cognitive performance in children.&lt;ref name=sibley/&gt; They reported a beneficial relationship in the categories of perceptual skills, intelligence quotient, achievement, verbal tests, mathematic tests, developmental level/academic readiness and other, with the exception of memory, that was found to be unrelated to physical activity.&lt;ref name=sibley&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Sibley BA, Etnier JL | year = 2003 | title = The Relationship Between Physical Activity and Cognition in Children: A Meta-Analysis | url = | journal = Pediatric Exercise Science | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 243–256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation was strongest for the age ranges of 4–7 and 11–13 years.&lt;ref name=sibley /&gt; On the other hand, Chaddock and colleagues (2011) found results that contrasted Sibley and Etnier's meta-analysis.

'''OLY''' ('''Olympian''') are [[post-nominal letters]] granted to athletes who have participated in the [[Olympic Games]]. The post-nominals are an honour designated to represent the special achievement of competing in the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="oly"&gt;{{cite news|title=OLY post-nominal letters to honour Olympians|url=https://olympians.org/news/983/oly-post-nominal-letters-to-honour-olympians/|accessdate=22 November 2017|work=World Olympians Association|date=11 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OLY initiative was introduced by the [[World Olympians Association]] (WOA) at the 8th International [[IOC]] Athletes Forum held on 11 November 2017 in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland.  The first Olympian to formally receive the honor was IOC President [[Thomas Bach]], an Olympic fencer from Germany. Within five days, more than 1,000 Olympians had registered.&lt;ref name="aips"&gt;{{cite news|title=More than 1000 Olympians register for OLY|url=http://www.aipsmedia.com/2017/11/16/21983/world-olympians-association-woa-olympics-olympians|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=International Sports Press Association|date=16 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the initiative, any athlete who participated at a Summer or Winter Olympic Games may register to receive an official letter granting him or her the use of the post-nominal OLY in official documentation, as well as social media and [[curriculum vitae]].&lt;ref name="aips"/&gt; According to the WOA, the post-nominals serve as symbolic recognition of special status reserved for Olympians in society. WOA President [[Joël Bouzou]] {{post-nominals|OLY}} told [[Around the Rings]]:  "It's time to recognize becoming an Olympian is like becoming a [[PhD]]. It takes 10 years. You learn about perseverance, you learn about equity, fair play. You are an example of this for society at large."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ATR First: A New Honor for Olympians Only|url=http://aroundtherings.com/site/A__62030/Title__ATR-First-A-New-Honor-for-Olympians-Only/292/Articles|accessdate=22 November 2017|work=Around The Rings|date=11 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patellar subluxation syndrome''', also known as '''patellar instability''', or '''unstable kneecap''' is an injury that is concerned with the [[kneecap]]. Patellar subluxation is more common than patellar dislocation and is just as disabling.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Dr. Ellison, A. E., M.D. et al. 1985. ''Athletic Training and Sports Medicine.'' New York: American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. First edition; second printing. {{ISBN|0-89203-002-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this condition, the [[patella]] repetitively subluxates and places [[strain (materials science)|strain]] on the [[medial restraints]] and excessive [[stress (mechanics)|stress]]/[[tension (physics)|tension]] on the [[patellofemoral joint]]. Patellar subluxation can be caused by osseous abnormalities, such as incorrect articulation of the femoral groove with the patella, trochlear dysplasia, or patella alta, which is a distance of greater than 20&amp;nbsp;mm between the tibial tubercle and the trochlear groove. It can also result from soft-tissue abnormalities, such as a torn medial patellofemoral ligament, or a weakened vastus medialis obliquus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19047722 | doi=10.2106/JBJS.H.00211 | volume=90 | title=Patellar instability. | date=Dec 2008 | journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am | pages=2751–62 | vauthors=Colvin AC, West RV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms are regulated by the amount of activity. Such [[pain]] is commonly caused by running and jumping [[sports]] and activities&lt;ref name=book/&gt; that place large forces on the patellofemoral joint.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms usually include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00350]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Knee buckles and can no longer support your weight
* Kneecap slips off to the side
* Knee catches during movement
* Pain in the front of the knee that increases with activity
* Pain when sitting
* Stiffness
* Creaking or cracking sounds during movement
* Swelling

Patellar subluxation was once thought to occur mainly in women,&lt;ref name=book/&gt; due to the frequency of [[genu valgum]] and lax [[ligaments]]. However, now the frequency of this condition in any athletic person, man or woman, is apparent.
==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=March 2018}}

==Treatment==

===Conservative Treatment===
Conservative treatment in primary acute LPD (lateral patellar dislocation) is the therapy of choice. It includes a multimodal approach with behavioural education of the patient, physical therapy, braces, weight reduction and pain medication.&lt;ref name="Surgical vs non-surgical"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hing CB, Smith TO, Donell S ''et al'' | year = 2011 | title = Surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd008106.pub2 | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 9 | issue = 11| page = CD008106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical therapy especially focuses on muscle strengthening and proprioceptive exercises. The vastus medialis oblique muscle is described to have an important role in functional stabilization of the patella against lateral vector force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith TO, Bowyer D, Dixon J ''et al'' | year = 2009 | title = Can vastus medialis oblique be preferentially activated? A systematic review of electromyographic studies | url = | journal = Physiother Theory Pract | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 69–98 | doi=10.1080/09593980802686953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proprioceptive exercises and strengthening of the hip abductors and positioning of the foot are crucial, especially indicated in patient with miserable malalignment syndrome or medial collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mascal CL, Landel R, Powers C | year = 2003 | title = Management of patellofemoral pain targeting hip, pelvis, and trunk muscle function: 2 case reports | url = | journal = J Orthop Sports Phys Ther | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 647–60 | doi=10.2519/jospt.2003.33.11.647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several patellar braces or taping methods exist to improve return to sport. They may however not alter medial or lateral displacement, but can be helpful as a diagnostic tool for occult patellofemoral instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Callaghan MJ, Selfe J | year = 2012 | title = Patellar taping for patellofemoral pain syndrome in adults | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd006717.pub2| journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 18 | issue = 4| page = CD006717 | url = http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/7477/1/7477_Selfe.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgical Treatment Options===
Increasing age is associated with decreased physical activity after surgical stabilization, and therefore in growing and very active athletes early surgical treatment intervention needs to be considered. Reconstruction of the MPFL (medial patellofemoral ligament) in patients with minor trochlear dysplasia is technically possible without interfering with distal growth plate of the femur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelitz M, Dornacher D, Dreyhaupt J ''et al'' | year = 2011 | title = The relationship of the distal femoral physis and the medial patellofemoral ligament | url = | journal = Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 2067–71 | doi=10.1007/s00167-011-1548-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, large studies are missing. Osseous articular correction before epiphyseal closure is contraindicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dejour D, Saggin P | year = 2010 | title = The sulcus deepening trochleaplasty - the Lyon's procedure | url = | journal = Int Orthop | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 311–6 | doi=10.1007/s00264-009-0933-8| pmc = 2899349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adult patients with recurrent LPD and without trochlear dysplasia or type A or C according to Dejour classification, MPFL reconstruction alone might be beneficial, in which unchanged osseous or dynamic instability will be compensated.&lt;ref name="Classification"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fucentese SF, Zingg PO, Schmitt J ''et al'' | year = 2011 | title = Classification of trochlear dysplasia as predictor of clinical outcome after trochleoplasty | url = | journal = Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 1655–61 | doi=10.1007/s00167-011-1410-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients with an important supra-trochlear spur as in type B and D trochlear dysplasia and chronic instability are more reluctant to conservative and softtissue surgical treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fithian DC, Paxton EW, Stone ML ''et al'' | year = 2004 | title = Epidemiology and natural history of acute patellar dislocation | url = | journal = Am J Sports Med | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 1114–21 | doi=10.1177/0363546503260788 | pmid=15262631}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty should be performed.&lt;ref name="Classification"/&gt; Typically, post-surgical results are more favourable when instability was the main symptom. Hence, in such patients low-pivoting physical activity may be re-achieved.

In the [[history of video games]], the '''seventh generation''' of home consoles began in late 2005 with the release of Microsoft's [[Xbox 360]], and continued with the release of Sony Computer Entertainment's [[PlayStation 3]] and Nintendo's [[Wii]] the following year. Each new console introduced a new type of breakthrough in technology. The Xbox 360 offered games rendered natively at [[high-definition video]] (HD) resolutions, the PlayStation 3 offered HD movie playback via a built-in [[Stereoscopy|3D]] [[Blu-ray Disc]] player, and the Wii focused on integrating [[Wii Remote|controllers]] with [[Sensor Bar|movement sensors]] as well as [[joystick]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wisniowski|first=Howard|url= http://www.analog.com/en/press-release/May_09_2006_ADI_Nintendo_Collaboration/press.html|title=Analog Devices And Nintendo Collaboration Drives Video Game Innovation With iMEMS Motion Signal Processing Technology|publisher=Analog Devices, Inc.|date= May 9, 2006|accessdate=May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Wii controllers could be moved about to control in-game actions, which enabled players to simulate real-world actions during gameplay (e.g., in the [[Wii sports]] tennis game, the user swings the controller to hit the on-screen image of a tennis ball). Video game consoles had become an important part of the global [[IT infrastructure]]. It is estimated that video game consoles represented 25% of the world's general-purpose computational power in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60|title=The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information|author=Martin Hilbert and Priscila López|doi=10.1126/science.1200970|year=2011|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=332|issue=6025|pages=60–65|pmid=21310967}} Free access to the article through martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Joining Nintendo in the motion market, Sony Computer Entertainment released the [[PlayStation Move]] in September 2010. The PlayStation Move features motion sensing gaming, similar to that of the Wii. Microsoft joined the scene in November 2010, with its [[Kinect]] (previously announced under the working title "Project Natal" in June 2009). Unlike the other two systems (PlayStation 3 and Wii), Kinect does not use controllers of any sort and makes the users the "controller." Having sold eight million units in its first 60 days on the market, Kinect claimed the [[Guinness World Record]] of being the "fastest selling consumer electronics device".&lt;ref name="10-million"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/03/09/microsoft-sells-10-million-kinects-10-million-kinect-games/ |title=Microsoft sells 10 million Kinects, 10 million Kinect games |first=Tim|last=Stevens |publisher=[[Engadget]] |date=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guinness-record"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Kinect-Confirmed-As-Fastest-Selling-Consumer-Electronics-Device/blog/3376939/7691.html |title=Kinect Confirmed As Fastest-Selling Consumer Electronics Device |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=March 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311213211/http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Kinect-Confirmed-As-Fastest-Selling-Consumer-Electronics-Device/blog/3376939/7691.html |archivedate=March 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Xbox 360 offers wired as well as wireless controllers as a standalone product, all PlayStation 3 controllers can be used in wired and wireless configurations. Starting with handheld consoles, the seventh generation began in November 2004 with the North American introduction of the [[Nintendo DS]] as a "third pillar", alongside Nintendo's existing [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[GameCube]] consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=515|title=Various Satoru Iwata comments regarding the Nintendo DS|first=Glen|last=Bayer|publisher=N-sider.com|date=March 1, 2004|accessdate=October 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nintendo DS (NDS) features a touch screen and built-in [[microphone]], and supports wireless [[IEEE 802.11]] ([[Wi-Fi]]) standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darkain.com/nintendo_ds/nifi.php | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217195147/http://www.darkain.com/nintendo_ds/nifi.php | archivedate=February 17, 2005 | title=Nintendo DS&amp;nbsp;– WI-FI vs NI-FI | author=Darkain |date=January 21, 2005 | accessdate=April 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the revised version of the NDS, the [[Nintendo DSi]], features two built in cameras, the ability to download games from the DSi store, and a web browser. The [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) released later the same year on December 12, 2004, followed a different pattern. It became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format, [[Universal Media Disc]] (UMD), as its primary storage media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/games/playstation-portable/psp/game-news/e3-2003-psp-press-release/4356/3143/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303170842/http://www.gamedaily.com/games/playstation-portable/psp/game-news/e3-2003-psp-press-release/4356/3143/|archivedate=March 3, 2009| title=E3 2003: PSP Press Release| date=December 31, 2003|publisher=gamedaily.com| accessdate=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/PSP/Movies/default.html| title=Support&amp;nbsp;– PSP&amp;nbsp;– Movies| publisher="Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=March 12, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080307104652/http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/PSP/Movies/default.html |archivedate = March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony also gave the PSP robust multi-media capability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/PSP/Features|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303080718/http://us.playstation.com/psp/features/ |archivedate=March 3, 2011 | title=PSP&amp;nbsp;– About&amp;nbsp;– Multimedia| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; connectivity with the PlayStation 3, [[PlayStation 2]], other PSPs, as well as Internet connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/remoteplay/remoteplay.html| title=User's Guide&amp;nbsp;– Remote Play| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/PSP/ConnectingToInternet/default.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315144612/http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/PSP/ConnectingToInternet/default.html|archivedate=March 15, 2008| title=Support&amp;nbsp;– PSP&amp;nbsp;– Connecting to the Internet| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nintendo DS likewise had connectivity to the internet through the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] and [[Nintendo DS &amp; DSi Browser|Nintendo DS Browser]], as well as wireless connectivity to other DS systems and Wii consoles. Despite high sales numbers for both consoles, PlayStation Portable sales have consistently lagged behind those of the Nintendo DS; nevertheless, the PlayStation Portable has the distinction of being the best-selling non-Nintendo handheld gaming system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/psp-vs-ds/8-reasons-why-the-psp-might-overtake-the-ds-327596.php| title=8 reasons why the PSP might overtake the DS| date=November 29, 2007| publisher=Gizmodo| accessdate=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] console, the [[Ouya]], received $8.5 million in pre-orders, launching in 2013. Post-launch sales were poor, and the device was a commercial failure. The business was wound down due to financial problems and sold to [[Razer Inc.]] Razer discontinued the Ouya in July 2015. Additionally, microconsoles like [[Nvidia Shield Console]], [[Mojo (microconsole)|MOJO]], [[Razer Switchblade]], [[GamePop]], [[GameStick]], [[Ouya]], and even more powerful PC-based [[Steam Machine (hardware platform)|Steam Machine]] consoles are attempting to compete in the game console market; however, even though some of these machines are theoretically powerful on paper, they are seldom referred to as "seventh generation" consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a450282/can-android-consoles-ouya-project-shield-challenge-playstation-xbox.html|title=Can Android consoles Ouya, Project Shield challenge PlayStation, Xbox?|last1=Langshaw|first1=Mark|last2=Reynolds|first2=Matthew|publisher=DigitalSpy.com|date=January 13, 2013|accessdate=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/with-ouya-gamestick-steam-box-and-more-will-2013-be-the-year-of-the-microconsole/|title=With Ouya, GameStick, Steam Box and more, will 2013 be the year of the 'microconsole'?|last=Kelly|first=Tadhg|publisher=Edge Online|date=January 10, 2013|accessdate=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/breaking-down-ouya-steam-box-new-wave-systems|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221190432/http://www.1up.com/features/breaking-down-ouya-steam-box-new-wave-systems|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 21, 2013|title=Digital and Nontraditional: Breaking Down Ouya, Steam Box, And Other New Wave Systems|last=Pereira|first=Chris|publisher=1up.com|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generation slowly began to wind down when Nintendo began cutting back on Wii production in the early 2010s by discontinuing the original Wii model within the Western world in 2011, discontinuing the system altogether in Japan in October 2013 and ceasing production of its Family Edition around the same time,&lt;ref name=engadget-discontinue&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/10/20/nintendo-stops-selling-wii-consoles-in-japan/|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=October 20, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2013|author=Jon Fingas|title=Nintendo stops selling Wii consoles in Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the Wii mini as its only surviving variant by 2014. Shortly afterwards, Sony announced that they had discontinued the production of the PlayStation Portable worldwide that year, following an earlier announcement from Nintendo that it had discontinued its original line of the Nintendo DS family devices to move onto the [[Nintendo 3DS line]], while continuing to support the Nintendo DSi. Microsoft also announced in 2016 that they would discontinue, but continue to support, the Xbox 360 at the end of April that year, making it the first seventh-generation console to cease production altogether. The following year, Sony announced that it would soon discontinue its PlayStation 3 line in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/playstation-3-production-halted-sony-japan-1202012032/|title=Sony to Halt Playstation 3 Production in Japan|publisher=Variety|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually in the rest of the world within a matter of months.  Around that time, the Wii mini and the Nintendo DSi were also discontinued, spelling the final end of the Wii, DS and by extension, the seventh generation.

[[Nintendo]] entered this generation with a new approach embodied by its Wii. The company planned to attract current hardcore and casual gamers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris |first=Chris |title=Nintendo continues to play coy |publisher=CNN |date=May 9, 2006 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/09/technology/e3_nintendo/index.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5fV21iwH5?url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/09/technology/e3_nintendo/index.htm |archivedate=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=December 12, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach was previously implemented in the [[Handheld game console|portable]] market with the [[Nintendo DS]].&lt;ref name="money" /&gt; Nintendo expressed hope that the new control schemes it had implemented would render conventionally controlled consoles obsolete, leading to Nintendo capturing a large portion of the existing market as well.&lt;ref name="Iwata Speech 06"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/e3_2006/speech/english.html | publisher=Nintendo | title=Nintendo President, Satoru Iwata, media briefing speech at E3 2006 | accessdate=April 3, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328054009/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/e3_2006/speech/english.html | archivedate=March 28, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2007, it was reported by the British newspaper ''[[Financial Times]]'' that the Wii's sales surpassed those of the Xbox 360, which had been released one year previously, and became the market leader in worldwide home console sales for the generation.&lt;ref name="wiileads"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sanchanta |first=Mariko |title=Nintendo's Wii takes console lead |publisher=Financial Times |date=September 12, 2007 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/51df0c84-6154-11dc-bf25-0000779fd2ac.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5fV2Od1Rb?url=http://media.ft.com/j/browser.js |archivedate=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=September 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in previous generations, Nintendo provided strong support for its new console with popular first-party franchises like ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Metroid]]'', and ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'', among others. To appeal to casual and non-gamers, Nintendo developed a group of core Wii games, consisting of ''Wii Sports'', ''Wii Play'', ''Wii Fit'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/wii/what/iwataasks/volume-4/part-1|title=Part 1 – A Truly Ground-breaking Collection of Games|work=Iwata Asks, Volume 4: Wii Sports|first=Satoru|last=Iwata|authorlink=Satoru Iwata|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=November 9, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708021300/http://www.nintendo.com/wii/what/iwataasks/volume-4/part-1 |archivedate = July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Wii Music'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1590904/20080715/story.jhtml |title=Nintendo Announces ''Wii Music'', Improved Wii Remote at E3 |first=Stephen |last=Totilo |work=MTV Multiplayer |publisher=MTV Networks |date=July 15, 2008 |accessdate=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; where players make use of the motion-sensing abilities of the console and its peripherals to simulate real world activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/wii/what/iwataasks/volume-4/part-4|title=Part 4 – Games That Even the People Watching Can Enjoy|work=Iwata Asks, Volume 4: Wii Sports|first=Satoru|last=Iwata|authorlink=Satoru Iwata|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=November 9, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080110114030/http://www.nintendo.com/wii/what/iwataasks/volume-4/part-4 |archivedate = January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of ''Wii Music'', the games and their sequels have all been highly successful.

Publishers such as [[Ubisoft]], [[Electronic Arts]], [[Capcom]], and [[Majesco Entertainment]] continued to release exclusive titles for the console, but the Wii's strongest titles remained within its first-party line-up. Analysts speculated that this would change in time as the Wii's growing popularity persuaded third-party publishers to focus on it;&lt;ref name="regain" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Wingfield | first =Nick |author2=Iwatani Kane, Yukari  | title =Wii and DS Turn Also-Ran Nintendo into Winner in Videogames Business | publisher =Wall Street Journal | date =April 19, 2007 | url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117691936534774315 | accessdate = December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, some third party developers expressed frustration at low software sales.&lt;ref name="Wary Publishers"&gt;{{cite web|last= Martin|first=Matt|title=Publishers wary of creating Nintendo titles, says Wii developer|date=January 24, 2007|publisher=[[Eurogamer|GamesIndustry.biz]]|accessdate=January 27, 2007|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/publishers-wary-of-creating-nintendo-titles-says-wii-developer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211030359/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=22368| archivedate=December 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goichi Suda]], developer of ''[[No More Heroes (video game)|No More Heroes]]'' for the Wii, noted that "only Nintendo titles are doing well. This isn't just because of the current situation in Japan, as this is happening outside Japan. I am very surprised about the reality about Wii, because before I was making this game, I wasn't expecting that Wii would be a console targeted only for non-gamers. I expected more games for hardcore gamers.

In early 2008, the [[NPD Group]] revealed sales data showing that, while the Wii's life-to-date [[attach rate]] was low, in December 2007, it reached 8.11—higher than the attach rates for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Casamassina |first= Matt |title=Wii Tie Ratio at 8:1 in December |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/847/847472p1.html |publisher=IGN |date=January 24, 2008 |accessdate=January 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wii's low overall attach rate could be explained by reference to its rapidly increasing [[installed base]], as financial analysts have pointed to the Xbox 360's high attach rates as indicative of an unhealthy lack of installed base growth, and warned that what actually benefits third-party developers is "quicker adoption of hardware and a rapidly growing installed base on which to sell progressively more game units," which tends to lower the attach rate of a product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Dobson |first= Jason | title = Opinion: Xbox 360 Software Attach Rate Is 'Alarming' | url= http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11796 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date= November 21, 2006| accessdate=January 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2009, Nintendo announced its first price drops for the console.

{{Main|Xbox 360}}

[[Microsoft]] Xbox 360 gained an early lead in terms of market share, largely due to its established [[Xbox Live]] online gaming system, and its early launch date, which was one year before its rivals. Sales in North America and Europe have continued to be strong, even after the release of the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation 3]]. Like its predecessor, the Xbox 360 received a muted reception in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muted hello for Xbox 360 in Japan|publisher=BBC|date=December 10, 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4517362.stm|accessdate=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to the lack of content aimed at Japanese gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fildes|first=Johnathan|title=Xbox still hopes to storm Japan|publisher=BBC|date=September 23, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5373066.stm|accessdate=October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This early launch did come with some trouble, as [[Xbox 360 technical problems|technical problems]] appeared in a portion of Xbox 360 units sold. The most well-known problem is the "[[red ring of death]]" and Error E74, which received a great deal of attention due to some users having to replace their consoles multiple times. Microsoft attempted to address this by offering a three-year warranty on all affected consoles and repairing them free of charge.&lt;ref name="moneyback"&gt;{{cite web |title=Xbox 360 Warranty Coverage Expanded |publisher=Microsoft |date=July 5, 2007 |url=http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/xbox360/hardware/warranty/warrantyupdate/WarrantyUpdate.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014072847/http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/xbox360/hardware/warranty/warrantyupdate/WarrantyUpdate.aspx |archivedate=October 14, 2008 |accessdate =October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also retroactively reimbursed owners of affected systems who paid for repairs.&lt;ref name="moneyback" /&gt; According to ''The Mercury News'', new models of the console featuring 65-nanometer technology will address this and other issues; the new technology is expected to reduce heat production, which will lower the risk of overheating and system failures; although, this has never been officially confirmed by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Takahashi |first=Dean |title=Microsoft's next move?

As they share many cross-platform games and compete for the same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=May 20, 2005 |last=Perry |first=Douglass |publisher=IGN |title=E3 2005: Microsoft's Xbox 360 vs. Sony's PlayStation 3 |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/617/617951p1.html |accessdate=May 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PS3 uses the [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard [[DVD9]].

At the end of first half of 2007, the console stabilized at 11.6 million units shipped as sales dropped 60% while its rival, [[Wii]], gained momentum and [[Sony]] announced a competitive price drop on the [[PlayStation 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McDougall |first=Paul |title=Microsoft Xbox 360 Sales Plunge 60% As Problems Mount |publisher=[[InformationWeek]] |date=July 20, 2007 | url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal_tech/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201200157|accessdate=November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lai |first=Marcus |title=Wii, Xbox 360 sales up; PS3 down at Ebay |publisher=Punch Jump |date=August 30, 2007 |url=http://news.punchjump.com/blog/2007/08/30/wii-xbox-360-sales-up-ps3-down-at-ebay-2/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007012335/http://news.punchjump.com/blog/2007/08/30/wii-xbox-360-sales-up-ps3-down-at-ebay-2/ |archivedate=October 7, 2007 |accessdate=November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Microsoft's strategy to boost sales with the release of the highly anticipated ''[[Halo 3]]'' in September 2007 paid off, outselling the Wii that month in North America.&lt;ref name="Xbox36Wii"&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyer |first=Brandon |title=Halo 3 Drives Xbox 360 Sales Above Wii in September |publisher =Gamasutra |date=October 19, 2007 |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15918 |accessdate=October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices Division experienced a huge increase in revenue, largely driven by the release of ''Halo 3'', and posted a quarterly profit for the first time in two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kuchera |first=Ben |title=Strong ''Halo 3'' launch helps Microsoft gaming to first profit in years |publisher=Ars Technica |date=October 26, 2007 |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2007/10/strong-halo-3-launch-helps-microsoft-to-first-ever-profit-on-gaming.ars |accessdate=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xbox 360's advantage over its competitors owes itself to the release of high-profile games, such as additions to the Halo franchise.

[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] PlayStation 3 was released on November 11, 2006 in Japan and November 17, 2006 in the US and Canada. The system's reliance on new technologies such as the [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell microprocessor]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] format caused difficulties in manufacturing, especially the Blu-ray diode, leading to shortages at launch and the delay of the [[PAL region]] launches; however, by early December 2006, Sony announced that all production issues had been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Graft| first =Kris| title =PS3 Manufacturing Troubles 'Solved'| publisher =Next Generation| date =December 8, 2006| url =http://www.next-gen.biz/news/sony-ps3-mfg-troubles-resolved| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120910211245/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/sony-ps3-mfg-troubles-resolved| dead-url =yes| archive-date =September 10, 2012| accessdate =October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Market analysts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sony's other units depend on the PS3's success |publisher=CNN |date=May 7, 2006 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/07/technology/sony_reut0507/index.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5fUxfqnva?url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/07/technology/sony_reut0507/index.htm |archivedate=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sony executives noted that the success of the PlayStation 3 and the [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] format were dependent on each other; Rich Marty, VP of New Business Development at [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] stated that the "PS3 is critical to the success of Blu-ray,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =PS3 fuels Blu-ray revolution says Sony Pictures | publisher =PSPSPS | date =September 6, 2007 | url =http://www.pspsps.tv/2007/09/ps3_fuels_bluray_revolution_sa_1.html | accessdate =December 18, 2007 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071130090916/http://www.pspsps.tv/2007/09/ps3_fuels_bluray_revolution_sa_1.html | archivedate =November 30, 2007 | df =mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Phil Harrison]] stated that the PlayStation 3's success would be ensured because "the growth of the Blu-ray Disc movie market ... is a positive factor which will play more into the consumer psyche ... as more consumer electronics firms launch standalone disc players, as more Blu-ray Disc movies become available, and as more shelf space is dedicated to the category at retail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Gibson | first =Ellie | title =Blu-ray will help ensure success of PlayStation 3, says Harrison | publisher =[[GamesIndustry.biz]] | date =March 13, 2007 | url =http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/blu-ray-will-help-ensure-ps3s-success-says-harrison | accessdate =December 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony would provide support for its console with new titles from acclaimed first-party franchises such as ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]],'' ''[[Team Ico]]'', and ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'', and secured a number of highly anticipated third-party exclusive titles, including ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', ''[[Yakuza 3]]'' and ''[[Valkyria Chronicles]]''.

![[Backward compatibility]]
| [[List of Xbox games compatible with Xbox 360|465 Selected Xbox]] games &lt;small&gt;(as of November 2007)&lt;/small&gt;. Additions made with software updates. Official Xbox hard drive required.
| The first generation model is backwards compatible with [[PlayStation|PS1]] and [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] titles through the inclusion of the [[Emotion Engine]] and [[Graphics Synthesizer]] chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |title=PS3 Backwards Compatibility Issues – New system has some problems with past titles |publisher=IGN |date=November 12, 2006 |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/745/745439p1.html |accessdate=April 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The second generation model offers less backward compatibility for PS2 titles. Owing to only featuring the [[Graphics Synthesizer]], and having to emulate the CPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoreware.net/playstation-3-80gbs-ps2-backwards-compatibility-sucks/ |title=Playstation 3 80GB's PS2 backwards compatibility sucks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Third and later generation models dropped support for all PS2 titles via disc, but some games in digital format, marketed as "PS2 Classics" via the PlayStation Store are still compatible via software emulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official PlayStation website – PS3 FAQ |url=http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Features |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104025509/http://www.us.playstation.com/ps3/features |archivedate=January 4, 2009 |accessdate=December 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Backward compatibility====
Early models of the Wii are fully [[backward compatibility|backwards compatible]] with [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] software and most of its accessories; the Wii Family Edition and the Wii Mini iterations lack GameCube support.&lt;ref name="familyedition" /&gt; Early versions of the PlayStation 3 and all models of the [[Xbox 360]] only offer partial support and use [[emulator|software emulation]] for backwards compatibility. Current versions of the PS3 do not offer [[PlayStation 2]] compatibility, though PS1 compatibility is retained. Some models of the first generation of the PS3 offered full backwards compatibility for PS2 games. The Xbox 360's compatibility is increased through game-specific [[patch (computing)|patches]] automatically downloaded from Xbox Live or downloaded and burned to a CD or DVD from the Xbox website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backwardcompatibilitygameslist.htm|publisher=Xbox.com |title=Xbox 360 – Original Xbox Games on Xbox 360&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|accessdate=May 13, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080512032530/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backwardcompatibilitygameslist.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PS3's compatibility is expanded with firmware updates.

All three consoles provide titles from older consoles for download; the Xbox 360 through the [[List of Xbox Originals|Xbox Originals]] service, the PlayStation 3 through the [[PlayStation Store]], and the Wii through the [[Virtual Console]]. When purchased, the game is saved to console's internal memory or, optionally on the Wii, to an inserted [[Secure Digital|SD]]/[[Secure Digital|SDHC]] card. Initially the Xbox 360 also provided Xbox Live support for backwards compatible games, but the service has since been discontinued for original Xbox games. No more games will be added to the list of backwards compatible games for the Xbox 360. In response to the lack of backward compatibility for most PS3s, many popular games have been released for download as PlayStation 2 Classics and other popular series have been updated with gameplay/graphics as [[high-definition remasters for PlayStation consoles]] and have been released on Blu-ray Disc or are available for download on the PlayStation Network.

====HDTV-capable video support and service====

However, the output signal may be protected by [[digital rights management]] and may require an [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]]-compliant display if [[HDMI]] is used. The [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] service and the [[PlayStation Store]] offer HD movies, TV shows, movie trailers, and clips for download to the console's HDD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32007/articles/disneystudiosnowonmarketplace.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713223845/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32007/articles/disneystudiosnowonmarketplace.htm|archivedate=July 13, 2007|title=Walt Disney Studios now on Xbox LIVE Marketplace|publisher=Xbox.com|accessdate=May 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/News/PressReleases/480|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731011131/http://www.us.playstation.com/News/PressReleases/480|archivedate=July 31, 2008| title='s Video Delivery Service to Offer Movies and TV Shows for Purchase and TV Shows for Purchase and Rental Through PLAYSTATION 3 and PSP (PlayStationPortable)| date=July 15, 2008| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment America| accessdate=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other regional PlayStation Stores only allow download of movie trailers and short segment clips. As of November 2009, the Video Download service present on the American PlayStation Store will be available for select European countries.

While only a small number of games [[rendering (computer graphics)|render]] video in native 1080p, many games can be automatically [[video scaler|scaled]] to output this resolution. The Wii is capable of outputting [[480p]] for the Wii Menu and most games through a component cable, which must be purchased separately.

In the September 2009 issue of ''[[Game Informer]]'' magazine, survey results were published in which among nearly 5000 readers who responded, 54.2% of those who owned an Xbox 360 had experienced a console failure for that system, compared with 10.6% for PlayStation 3, and 6.8% for Wii.&lt;ref name="GI failure survey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamespot.com/6215590 |title=Xbox 360 failure rate = 54.2%? |first=Tor |last=Thorsen |date=August 18, 2009 |work=GameSpot |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=December 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, warranty provider [[SquareTrade]] published console failure rate estimates, in which the proportion of its customers reporting a system failure in the first two years is 23.7% for Xbox 360, 10.0% for PlayStation 3, and 2.7% for Wii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squaretrade.com/pages/xbox360-ps3-wii-reliability-08-2009/ |title=Game Console Failure Rates: Wii 9 times more reliable than Xbox 360, 4 times more than PS3 |date=August 2009 |publisher=SquareTrade |page=1 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324011002/http://www.squaretrade.com/pages/xbox360-ps3-wii-reliability-08-2009/ |archivedate=March 24, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[handheld game console|video game handhelds]], the seventh generation began with the release of the [[Nintendo DS]] on November 21, 2004. This handheld was based on a design fundamentally different from the [[Game Boy]] and other handheld video game systems. The Nintendo DS offered new modes of input over previous generations such as a touch screen, the ability to connect wirelessly using IEEE 802.11b, as well as a microphone to speak to in-game NPCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darkain.com/nintendo_ds/nifi.php | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217195147/http://www.darkain.com/nintendo_ds/nifi.php | archivedate=February 17, 2005 | title=Nintendo DS – WI-FI vs NI-FI | author=Darkain |date=January 21, 2005 | accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, 2004, Sony released its first handheld, [[PlayStation Portable]]. The PlayStation Portable was marketed at launch to an above-25-year-old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last=Brightman |first=James |title=SCEA: PSP Will Be Big Revenue Driver |publisher=GameDaily |date=June 26, 2007 |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/scea-psp-will-be-big-revenue-driver/70598/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314015725/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/scea-psp-will-be-big-revenue-driver/70598/ |archivedate=March 14, 2008 |accessdate=November 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "core gamer" market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sheffield |first=Brandon |title=What's the Dille?

[[Nokia]] revived its [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] platform in the form of a service for selected [[S60 (software platform)|S60]] devices. [[N-Gage (service)|This new service]] launched on April 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.n-gage.com/ngi/ngage/web/g0/en/community/articles.Detail.general-anewdayforngage.1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611075632/http://www.n-gage.com/ngi/ngage/web/g0/en/community/articles.Detail.general-anewdayforngage.1.html |archivedate=June 11, 2008 |title= A New Day for N-Gage |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=April 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other less-popular handheld systems released during this generation include the [[Gizmondo]] (launched on March 19, 2005 and discontinued in February 2006) and the [[GP2X]] (launched on November 10, 2005 and discontinued in August 2008). The [[GP2X Wiz]], [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]], and [[Gizmondo 2]] were scheduled for release in 2009.

Another aspect of the seventh generation was the beginning of direct competition between dedicated handheld gaming devices, and increasingly powerful PDA/cell phone devices such as the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]], and the latter being aggressively marketed for gaming purposes. Simple games such as [[Tetris]] and [[Solitaire]] had existed for PDA devices since their introduction, but by 2009 PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented, with the advantage of distribution over wireless broadband.

Sony announced in 2014 that they had discontinued the production of the PlayStation Portable worldwide, this follows Nintendo's announcement in 2014 that it had discontinued its original line of DS family devices to move onto the 3DS line.

==Disability classifications==
{{main article|Disability sport classification}}
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five [[Summer Paralympic Games#Disability categories|disability categories]]; [[amputation]], the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; [[cerebral palsy]]; [[wheelchair]] athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; [[visual impairment]], including [[blindness]]; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example [[dwarfism]] or [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name=class1&gt;{{cite web |title=Paralympics categories explained |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |date=3 September 2008 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/09/03/2354016.htm?site=paralympics/2008 |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=class2&gt;{{cite news |title=Making sense of the categories |publisher=[[BBC|BBC Sport]] |date=6 October 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics2000/paralympics/959701.stm |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[Paralympic Games#Summer sports|Paralympic sport]] then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics|athletics]], divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Paralympics|swimming]], group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.&lt;ref name=class3&gt;{{cite news |title=A-Z of Paralympic classification |publisher=[[BBC|BBC Sport]] |date=28 August 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7586684.stm |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[South Korea]]''' (officially the '''Republic of Korea''') was the host nation of the '''[[2002 Asian Games]]''' held in [[Busan]] from September 29 to October 14, 2002. South Korea was represented by the [[Korean Olympic Committee]], and the South Korean delegation was the largest in this edition of the [[Asian Games]]. The delegation of 1,008 people included 770 competitors&amp;nbsp;– 460 men, 310 women&amp;nbsp;– and 238 officials (217 men and 21 women). [[North Korea at the 2002 Asian Games|North Korea]] competed for the first time in an international sporting event hosted by South Korea. Both nations marched together at the opening ceremony with a [[Korean Unification Flag]] depicting the [[Korean Peninsula]] as [[Korean reunification|United Korea]].

Competitors from the South Korea led the bronze medal count with 84 in the [[2002 Asian Games medal table|general medal table]]. South Korea also won 96 gold medals, 80 silver medals and a total of 260 medals, finishing second on the medal table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ocasia.org/Game/MWinner.aspx?AMWCode=18&amp;GCode=1 | title=Overall medal standings&amp;nbsp;– Busan 2002 | publisher=ocasia.org.

==Background==
South Korea hosted the Asian Games for the second time after the [[1986 Asian Games]] in [[Seoul]]. 2002 Asian Games (officially known as the 14th Asian Games) came out to be politically successful for the host nation as this was the first time in the history that [[North Korea at the 2002 Asian Games|North Korea]] competed in an international sporting event hosted by their southern neighbor.&lt;ref name="economist "&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/1371329?story_id=1371329 | title=The Koreas united, for a day | work=[[The Economist]] | date=October 3, 2002 | accessdate=January 30, 2012 | location=[[City of Westminster|Westminster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Olympic Committee]] of South Korea, Korean Olympic Committee, selected a delegation consisted of 770 athletes (460 men and 310 women) and 238 officials (217 men and 21 women).&lt;ref name="delegation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.busanasiangames.org/Eng/ag/ba_elist_by_nat.asp | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030623062803/http://www.busanasiangames.org/Eng/ag/ba_elist_by_nat.asp | archivedate=June 23, 2003 | title=Participation General&amp;nbsp;– Each National &amp; Regional | publisher=busanasiangames.org.

[[Image:Speedminton game on rooftop.jpg|thumb|right|Crossminton on a rooftop]]
'''Crossminton''' is a racket game which is often associated with the brand '''Speedminton''' because of their historical relation. From 1 January 2016 the name of the racket sport has been changed from Speed Badminton to '''Crossminton'''.
The sport combines elements from different sports like badminton, squash and tennis. Today, Crossminton is played all around the world. There is no net in between and no prescribed playground, so it can be executed on tennis courts, streets, beaches, fields or gyms.  The court consists of two squares of 5.50&amp;nbsp;m (18&amp;nbsp;ft) length. They are fixed opposite to each other at a distance of 12.8&amp;nbsp;m (42&amp;nbsp;ft). Currently, there are tournaments all over the world which are organized in a growing number of clubs. On August 25, 2011 the International Crossminton Organization (ICO) was founded under the name International Speed Badminton Organisation (ISBO) in Berlin. In 2018 the ICO has already 26 members - national federations from Europe, America, Asia and Africa.

== Equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crossminton.org/equipment/|title=Equipment|website=International Crossminton Organisation|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
[[File:Match450.jpg|thumb|Match Speeder]]
Both of the players need a [[Racket (sports equipment)|racket]]. The rackets are similar to the ones used in squash but are specially produced for Crossminton. They are 58–60&amp;nbsp;cm long, and the material and the strings are different. The ball is called speeder and is heavier than a conventional badminton [[shuttlecock]], meaning it can be used up to wind force 4.

== History ==

The special shuttlecock and the idea of the game were invented in 2001 in Berlin by Bill Brandes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morgenpost.de/sport/berlin-sport/article117148871/Speed-Badminton-ein-Sport-den-es-ohne-Berliner-nicht-gaebe.html "Speed Badminton - ein Sport, den es ohne Berliner nicht gäbe - Berlin-Sport - Berliner Morgenpost"]&lt;/ref&gt; The game was refined to the final game of crossminton by the Speedminton company. The inventor first named his new sport "shuttleball", but soon the game was renamed "speed badminton". Starting from January 2016 the name was changed again, to '''crossminton'''. Originally, the idea of the inventor was to create an outdoor variant of badminton, so he changed the ball to be smaller and heavier (today called speeder). The analogy of badminton now exists only in a technical way: there is no net and the game tempo is faster. In 2003, there were already 6,000 active players in Germany. The sport is growing steadily and there are numerous international tournaments across Europe.

== Rules&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crossminton.org/the-rules/|title=The Rules|last=|first=|date=|website=International Crossminton Organisation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
[[Image:Speedminton speedset.jpg|thumb|right|Equipment]]
The field consists of two squares measuring 5.5 meters (18&amp;nbsp;ft) on each side. The distance between the squares is 12.8 meters (42&amp;nbsp;ft). Crossminton can be played on half of a tennis court which can easily be modified with elastic lines. Match Speeders are used for normal games. Children and adolescents (U12) play with fun speeders on a smaller court (4x4 m) over a smaller distance (9 meters).

The aim of the game is to reach the square of the opposite player with the speeder. If the speeder falls outside the opposite square, the other side gains a point. Both players are allowed to step out of, or any where inside their square during play.

The game ends when one player has at least 16 points and has at least 2 points advantage over their opponent. Every time a set/round finishes, the players switch sides.

=== Set ===
A set is played until 16 points. At a score of 15:15 there is overtime where two points head start are needed to win the set. A game usually lasts three winning sets.  At tournaments, it is possible to play only two winning sets until the half finals.

=== Service ===
The right to serve first is drawn by throwing a coin or a speeder. Every player has three serves. Every rally scores. At a score of 15:15 the serve switches after every point. The serve must be done out of the designated zone which is 3 m behind the front offensive line. This line must not be crossed and the serve is played bottom-up. The first serve of the next set is done by the loser of the previous set.

=== Points ===
Every rally scores if there is no necessity to repeat it. Points can be gained if:
* the serve is not correct
* the speeder touches the floor or the roof
* the speeder lands in the opposite court and cannot be returned
* the speeder lands outside the court (the lines count as being within the court)
* the speeder is touched two times immediately after each other
* the speeder touches the body

If a player returns a speeder from outside the court, it is considered to still be in play.

=== Change of ends ===
After every set, there is a change of ends to guarantee equal opportunities concerning wind and lighting conditions. If a fifth game (tiebreak) becomes necessary, players change sides after every 6 points.

== Variants ==
* '''Doubles''' : The doubles match is played on a single court.
At the double division, both players are standing in the same court. The coin or speeder decides the side who serves first. The serving player stands at the backline, and his partner stands in front. The serves rotate between the four players. The first serve in the following set goes to the loser of the previous one.

* '''Black lighting''' : Crossminton can be played by night with [[fluorescent]] equipment and [[black light]].
Crossminton can be played outside and inside, the court can be painted or pegged off. There is even the possibility to use a portable court. Crossminton played in the dark is called Blackminton. With black lights, fluorescent paints, rackets and special speeders (night speeders) with glow sticks (speedlights) it is possible to play even at night.

== World &amp; European Championships ==

== Nations Cup ==
Since 2013 the ICO organizes a national team competition called ICO Nations Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crossminton.org/nations-cup/past-results/|title=Past results|website=International Crossminton Organisation|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is derived from tennis competitions like David Cup or Fed Cup, but in crossminton mixed teams consisting of both male and female players are competing. First, Regional tournaments are played in group- or elimination system and then the winners of Regional tournaments – Regional Champions – battle it out for the title of ICO Nations Cup Champion at the Final tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crossminton.org/nations-cup/tournament-mode/|title=Tournament mode|website=International Crossminton Organisation|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A national team consists of at least three players – 2 male players (open category, but not as a rule) and 1 female player (women’s category, but not as a rule) – and not more than five players (3 players + 2 reserves that can step in for either singles or doubles matches). A clash between two national teams constists of 6 matches – 4 singles and 2 doubles matches.

Athletics were an important part of the cultural life of Ancient Greeks. Depictions of boxing and [[bull-leaping]] can be found back to the [[Bronze Age Greece|Bronze Age]].  Buildings were created for the sole use of athletics including [[Stadion (running race)|stadions]], [[palaestra]], and [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]]. Starting in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Period]], [[Panhellenic Games]], including the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], begin taking place each year. These games gave people from all over Greece the chance to gain fame for their athletic prowess. Athletics in Greece became one of the most commonly depicted scenes of everyday life in their art.

== Architecture relating to athletics ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}

As the site of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], the architecture of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] is heavily influenced by the theme of athletics. The temple of Zeus, for example, is decorated with a frieze containing the 12 labors of [[Heracles]], who is believed to be the founder of the Olympic Games, and a [[Eastern Pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia|pediment]] depicting the myth of [[Pelops]], another origin tale of the Olympics. 
[[File:Stadium at Olympia 2013.JPG|thumb|Birth of the Olympic Games in the Stadium at Olympia]]
The main site of where the Olympic Games took place was the [[Stadium at Olympia]] which is located to the east of the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|sanctuary of Zeus]]. The physical landmarks of the Stadium are 212.54 meters long and 30–34 meters wide, and it served mainly for running races that determined the fastest person in the world. The track was made of hard-packed clay to serve as traction for the people competing in the running events.

The site of Nemea showcase both the practical and ceremonial use of athletic architecture in the early Hellenistic monumentalization of Panhellenic sanctuaries. The bath house [[Nemean Baths]] contains a western room with basin baths and an eastern plunge bath. The western basin room is common of 4th century baths throughout Greece and was likely place where visiting athletes could wash themselves during their stay. The eastern plunge bath however, is one of only 4 others in Greece, all of which have been found at Panhellenic ritual sites. Though its exact function is unknown, its public nature suggests that it may have had a ritual component in the athletic games or ceremonies. Nemea also housed a stadium, where athletes would participate in games, specifically the stadion (running event).

== Depictions of Games ==

During the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] practiced several sports, including wrestling, bull jumping, acrobatics, and boxing. This is apparent in multiple pieces of art, ranging from frescoes to pottery. The youth of the boys in the [[Akrotiri Boxer Fresco]] hints that athletes began training very early on in life, suggesting that sports were extremely important to Minoan society. It has even been suggested that athletics played a religious role in society due to their widespread practice. Finally, the youth of athletes in many pieces of artwork indicates that athletic competition may have been a rite if passage into adulthood for the Minoans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhw.gr/olympics/ancient/en/102.html|title=OLYMPIC GAMES|website=www.fhw.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular and famous combat sports in Ancient Greece was [[boxing]]. Boxing in Ancient Greece was far less regulated than modern boxing, with opponents chosen at random, regardless of weight or age, and matches lasting until one of the competitors admitted defeat or was left unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/boxing.html|title=Ancient Sports: Boxing|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighters were often left disfigured; for example, one boxing injury commonly depicted was the [[cauliflower ear]], which was depicted notably in the [[Boxer Stele Fragment from Kerameikos|Boxer Stele from Kerameikos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many who participated in these ancient boxing matches were gravely injured or even killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/the-bloody-deadly-heavy-fights-of-ancient-greece|title=The Bloody, Deadly, Heavy Fights of Ancient Greece {{!}} FIGHTLAND|work=Fightland|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, boxing was highly popular among the Ancient Grecian population and therefore was frequently featured on works of art. Another notable depiction of an ancient boxer is [[Boxer at Rest]], also known as Terme Boxer, who has just finished a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/features/2013/the-boxer|title=The Boxer: An Ancient Masterpiece Comes to the Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Boeotian Dancer's Group Kothon, Black Figure Tripod, 6th Century B.C.|kothon, black-figure tripod by the Boeotian Dancer's Group]] features two men engaged in a boxing match on one of its legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.artstor.org/#/asset/AMICO_DALLAS_103842516|title=Artstor|last=Artstor|website=library.artstor.org|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletic events, particularly [[Panhellenic festivals]], brought drew both athletes and spectators. Occurrences of athletic competitions were first recorded by [[Homer]] in the [[Iliad]]. As a result, competitions had ties with war and military training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/abccliow/development_of_the_concept_of_sport_in_the_greek_world/0|title=Development of the Concept of Sport in the Greek World - World History Encyclopedia - Credo Reference|website=search.credoreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of athletic events in ancient art sometimes show the athletes wearing armor in order to illustrate the connection between athletes and warriors.

Depictions of athletic events were also portrayed on pieces of pottery used in everyday life. Artists like [[Onesimos (vase painter)|Onesimos]] and the [[Foundry Painter]] depicted events such as [[Pankration|pancration]] scenes and wrestling matches on kylixes which were then used at [[symposium]]s or male drinking parties. Both of these painters used the red-figure technique, developed in Athens in 530 B.C., in their work and this technique allowed them to have greater freedom to express movement, emotion, and anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/vase/hd_vase.htm|title=Athenian Vase Painting: Black- and Red-Figure Techniques {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Art|first=Author: Department of Greek and Roman|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depictions of Athletic events in Art expanded as major athletic events also expanded. In 708 BCE, the [[pentathlon]] was added to the Olympic games. Since this event required the skills for five different events ([[Discus throw|discus]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], [[long jump]], [[running]], and [[wrestling]]) these athletes were held in high regard among society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/TC006EN.html|title=Ancient Olympics|website=ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became common to have a [[Kylix depicting Pentathletes|kylix]] or an amphora depict these events, and in turn, it praised the athletes by leaving their legacy in the art.

The [[Kleophrades Terracotta Panathenaic Prize Amphora|Kleophrades terracotta Panathenaic prize amphora]] (ca. 500 BCE) provides an example of recognition for success in athletic endeavors. At the [[Panathenaic Games]], victors would be awarded a prize amphora filled with a luxury good like olive oil. The amphora itself would depict [[Athena Promachos]], or Athena as a military leader directing troops into battle, and the athletic event in which the victor competed. Recognition for athletic endeavors and success by depicting the event itself as this Panathenaic prize amphora does highlights just how important athleticism was to the Ancient Greeks. Another example of the many Panathenaic Prize Amphoras is the [[Euphiletos Painter Panathenaic Amphora]] (530 BC). Painted in black figure, this Panathenaic amphora depicts a [[Stadion (running race)|stadion]] from Panathenaic games. Like other prize amphora, this amphora serves to emphasize athleticism and the victors of these events.

Descriptions of women’s sport during Archaic Period mainly come from literary sources, and there are a few examples of female sporting events. One of the most popular forms of physical activity for ancient Greek women is running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D.|first=Mills, Brett|date=|title=Women of Ancient Greece: Participating in Sport?.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED370951|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bronze Statuette of Athletic Spartan Girl|bronze statuettes of athletic Spartan girl]], which depicts Spartan young women involving in racing games, provide material evidence to the accounts of different women’s races in ancient Greece.

== Athletic Dedications ==

The prominence of athletic subject material in Greek art is no coincidence. Even statuary, called Athletic Dedications, arose as a way to immortalize Greek athletes and athletic games. Athletic events and art were so closely related that a common practice of athletes was to commemorate their victories with artistic dedications. One example of this would be the marble [[Apobates Base]] which commemorates victory in a chariot race at the [[Panathenaic Games]]. A competitor would erect a dedication to celebrate an athletic victory and place it in a sanctuary or Panhellenic site.  These dedications were an artistic celebration of athletic prowess which every Greek could observe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/greek-art/beginners-guide-greece/a/olympic-games|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AGMA Victorious Apobates 7305.jpg|thumb|[[Apobates Base]]]]
As part of the games taking place at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], many individuals competed in the pentathlon, a competition consisting of five events. The [[Ancient Olympic pentathlon|Ancient Olympic Pentathlon]] consisted of the [[discus throw]], [[long jump]]s with weights attached to their feet, [[javelin throw]], [[running]], and [[wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/pentathlon.html|title=Ancient Olympic Events|last=|first=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many victors of the pentathlon would go on to receive prizes such as exclusive items that were made specifically for the victor. For example, the amphorae of the [[Panathenaic Games]], often filled with expensive olive oil, featured [[Athena]] standing with a sword and shield to represent their victory in the games.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Bothmer|first=Dietrich|date=|title=A Panathenaic Amphora|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257530.pdf.bannered.pdf|journal=Metropolitan Museum of Art|volume=|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Olympics were dedicated to [[Zeus]], often these prizes would become votive dedications to him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Bronze Diskos Thrower Statue|Bronze Diskos Thrower]] (''Discobolus'') was a rare commodity that came from a time in which not many pieces survived: the end of the Persian Wars. The piece itself still exhibits many traits of archaic art, despite coming from the early Classical period (480 - 460 BCE). The athlete in the statue was a participant of diskos throwing, a very popular event in Ancient Greece and even modern day Olympics.

Teams of this name have received particular public attention due to the fact that the term "[[redskin (slang)|redskin]]" is now generally regarded as disparaging and offensive.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{Cite OED|redskin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/redskin|title=Definition of REDSKIN|publisher=Merriam-Webster| quote=Definition of REDSKIN (usually offensive): american indian| accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ahd&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=redskin| title=The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition| year=2011| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company| quote=n.

The most prominent team of this name is the [[Washington Redskins]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), which has been at the center of an [[Washington Redskins name controversy|ongoing controversy]] and campaigns to change the name. Various high school and youth teams have also used the name, though the number has been steadily declining. The college sports teams using the name changed voluntarily prior to the [[NCAA Native American mascot decision]] in 2005; the [[University of Utah]] became [[Utah Utes]] in 1972, [[Miami University| Miami University of Ohio]] became the [[Miami RedHawks|RedHawks]] in 1997 and the [[Southern Nazarene University]] became the [[Southern Nazarene Crimson Storm|Crimson Storm]] in 1998. Defenders of the Redskins name, both nationally and locally, cite their tradition, and the pride they feel in their team, while calls for change are often dismissed as [[political correctness]].

==Term==
{{main|Redskin (slang)}}

''Redskin'' is one of the color terms for race that emerged in the [[colonial history of the United States|colonial period]] as Native Americans encountered people who called themselves "white" and their slaves "black". The use of "red" as an identifier by Native Americans for themselves emerged in the context of Indian-European diplomacy in the southeastern region of North America, before later being adopted by Europeans.&lt;ref name="Shoemaker.1997"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://peopleofonefire.com/how_indians_got_to_be_red.pdf | last=Shoemaker| first=Nancy| title=How Indians Got to Be Red| journal=The American Historical Review| volume=102| issue=3| date=1997| pages=625–644| doi=10.2307/2171504}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|627–8}} The choice of red rather than other colors may have been due to cultural associations, rather than skin color; the red/white dichotomy having symbolic meaning for Native Americans in the southeast.&lt;ref name="Shoemaker.1997"/&gt;{{rp|632}} Usage in the northeast region by Europeans may have been largely limited to descriptions of tribes such as the [[Beothuk]] of Newfoundland, whose practice of painting their bodies and possessions with [[red ochre]] led Europeans to refer to them as "Red Indians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historica.ca/the_beothuk.php |title=The Beothuk Indians - "Newfoundland's Red Ochre People" |work=Historica Canadiana |date=6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the term "redskin" is debated.

==Controversy==
{{main|Native American mascot controversy}}
Native American mascots are often discussed in the media in terms of offensiveness, which reduces it to feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor=C.

In 2005, the [[American Psychological Association]] issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment, the negative impact on the self-esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights. It also impacts non-natives by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes, preventing learning about Native American culture. The APA states that stereotyping is disrespectful of the beliefs, traditions and values of Native Americans.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/indian-mascots.aspx|title=Summary of the Resolution Recommending Retirement of American Indian Mascots|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar resolutions have been adopted by the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nasss.org/nasss-native-american-imagery-resolution/| title=NASSS Native American Imagery Resolution| date=October 28, 2005| publisher=North American Society for the Sociology of Sport| accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Sociological Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/about/Council_Statements/use_of_native_american_nicknames_logos_and_mascots.cfm |title=Statement by the Council of the American Sociological Association on Discontinuing the Use of Native American Nicknames, Logos and Mascots in Sport |publisher=American Sociological Association |date=March 6, 2007 |accessdate=2013-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221184942/http://asanet.org/about/Council_Statements/use_of_native_american_nicknames_logos_and_mascots.cfm |archivedate=February 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Counseling Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counseling.org/docs/resolutions/resolutions-2001-present.pdf?sfvrsn=2 |publisher=American Counseling Association |title=Opposition to Use of Stereotypical Native American Images as Sports Symbols and Mascots |year=2001 |accessdate=2013-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915125336/http://counseling.org/docs/resolutions/resolutions-2001-present.pdf?sfvrsn=2 |archivedate=2013-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Anthropological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/rdcms-aaa/files/production/public/FileDownloads/pdfs/issues/press/upload/Sports-Mascot-Resolution-Release-Final.pdf |title=AAA Calls on Sports Organizations to Denounce Inappropriate American Indian Mascots |date=March 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204135245/http://s3.amazonaws.com/rdcms-aaa/files/production/public/FileDownloads/pdfs/issues/press/upload/Sports-Mascot-Resolution-Release-Final.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 report on the status of Native American students, the [[National Education Association]] included the elimination of Indian mascots and sports team names as one of its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Report on the Status of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Education|first=|author=Trujillo,Octaviana (Ph.D.)|author2=Alston, Denise (Ph.D.)|year=2005|publisher=National Education Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Washington Redskins==
{{main|Washington Redskins name controversy}}
Native American individuals, tribes and organizations have been questioning the use of the name and image for decades. In the 1940s the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI) created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media. Over time, the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J Gordon Hylton|title=BEFORE THE REDSKINS WERE THE REDSKINS: THE USE OF NATIVE AMERICAN TEAM NAMES IN THE FORMATIVE ERA OF AMERICAN SPORTS, 1857–1933|publisher=North Dakota law review| date=2010-01-01| volume=86| page=879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAI maintains that teams with Indian mascots [[Defamation|defame]] Native American people, perpetuate negative stereotypes and demeaning their native traditions and rituals.&lt;ref name="NCAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAI issued a new report in 2013 summarizing opposition to Indian mascots and team names generally, and the Washington Redskins in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/news/articles/2013/10/10/ncai-releases-report-on-history-and-legacy-of-washington-s-harmful-indian-sports-mascot|title=NCAI Releases Report on History and Legacy of Washington's Harmful "Indian" Sports Mascot|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the continued controversy, the team owner Dan Snyder sent an open letter to fans that was published in ''The Washington Post'' on October 9, 2013. In the letter Snyder states that the most important meaning of the name Redskins is the association that fans have to memories of their personal history with the team. Snyder also states that the name was chosen in 1933 to honor Native Americans in general and the coach and four players at that time who were Native American; and that in 1971 the then coach George Allen consulted with the Red Cloud Athletic Fund on the Pine Ridge reservation when designing the logo.&lt;ref name="snyder"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/letter-from-washington-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-to-fans/2013/10/09/e7670ba0-30fe-11e3-8627-c5d7de0a046b_story.html|title=Letter from Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to fans|work=The Washington Post|date=October 9, 2013|author=Michelle Boorstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] (TTAB) voted to cancel the six trademarks held by the team in a two to one decision that held that the term "redskins" is disparaging to a "substantial composite of Native Americans".&lt;ref name="ttabvue.uspto.gov"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92046185&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=199|title=USPTO TTABVUE.

==High schools==
The number of high schools using the Redskins name has been in steady decline, 40% having had local efforts to change the name. Between 1988 and April 2013, 28 high schools in 18 states had done so.&lt;ref name="CNSMaryland.20130402"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnsmaryland.org/interactives/other-redskins/| title=The Other Redskins| agency=Capitol News Service| publisher=[[Philip Merrill College of Journalism]]| first=Kelyn| last=Soong| date=April 2, 2013| accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December, 2017, the number of high school "Redskins" had continued to decline from 62 to 49,&lt;ref name="CNSMaryland.20171219"&gt;{{cite news| first1=Adam| last1=Zielonka| first2=Dylan| last2=Sinn| title=More than a Mascot: Redskins High Schools| agency=Capital News Service| publisher=[[Philip Merrill College of Journalism]]|  date=December 19, 2017| url=http://cnsmaryland.org/more-than-a-mascot-redskins-high-schools/ | accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including four affected by a 2015 California law.&lt;ref name="Melanie Mason"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-pc-redskins-mascot-banned-20151011-story.html| title=California schools barred from using 'Redskins' as team name or mascot| author=Melanie Mason| date=October 11, 2015| newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in the national controversy===
On its official website in early 2013, the [[Washington Redskins]] posted articles referring to high school teams using the same name (and often the same logo). The athletic director of [[Coshocton High School]] in [[Coshocton, Ohio]] is quoted as saying, "We are very proud of our athletic teams and very proud to be called Redskins!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redskins.com/news-and-events/article-1/We-Are-Very-Proud-To-Be-Called-Redskins/d4d7c05d-be39-4a27-9244-d06cfae46797|title=We Are Very Proud To Be Called Redskins|date=February 11, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal of [[McLoud High School]] in [[McLoud, Oklahoma]] says that not only students, but the local Native American population takes pride in the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redskins.com/news-and-events/article-1/McLoud-Our-Community-Is-Proud-Of-Our-Name/cc374c86-5782-4bb2-a0e0-d8c4c9f313b8|title=McLoud: 'Our Community Is Proud Of Our Name'|date=February 12, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coach at [[Lamar High School (Houston, Texas)|Lamar High School]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] says, "Our school is 75 years old and there's a lot of pride in it," he explained. "I think it's a great mascot, as all of the traits of a Redskins [[warrior]] are something to be admired."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redskins.com/news-and-events/article-1/Lamar-Once-A-Redskin-Always-A-Redskin/9ee6ad61-018f-42e0-b3d9-eb72a8b638e9|title=Lamar: 'Once A Redskin, Always A Redskin.'|date=February 13, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for the Washington team often refer to the three majority Native American schools, concluding that because some Native Americans use the name to refer to themselves, it is not insulting.&lt;ref name=Spoken&gt;{{cite web |author=Rick Reilly |title=Have the people spoken? |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds/ |website=ESPN |accessdate=October 15, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919035546/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds |archivedate=September 19, 2013 |deadurl=no |date=September 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the principal of one of these, [[Red Mesa High School]] in [[Teec Nos Pos, Arizona]], said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate "the legacy of negativity that the term has created."&lt;ref name="Michelle Peirano"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cronkitenewsonline.com/2013/05/in-debate-over-redskins-name-is-the-r-word-for-racism-or-respect/|title=In debate over Redskins name, is the 'R-word' for racism or respect?|date=May 1, 2013|author=Michelle Peirano|newspaper=Cronkite News|accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellpinit High School on the [[Spokane people|Spokane Indian]] Reservation in Washington wants nothing to do with the national controversy, seeing Redskins as the traditional name they have used for their team.

===Recent changes===
The Cooperstown Central School Board of Education in [[Cooperstown, New York]] voted 6-1 on March 6, 2013 to remove the Redskins mascot from its interscholastic athletic, extracurricular and academic programs. The move was prompted by a vote by the student body, asking that the mascot be changed. The [[Oneida Indian Nation]] was so moved by the actions of the Cooperstown students, that a letter by Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter was written to the students, commending their decision and offering to make a contribution to help offset the cost of changing mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/pressroom/latestnews/Oneida-Indian-Nation-Congratulates-Cooperstown-Central-School-Board-for-Voting-to-Remove-Redskins-Mascot-196067191.html|title=Oneida Indian Nation Congratulates Cooperstown Central School Board for Voting to Remove Redskins Mascot|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=March 14, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020014424/http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/pressroom/latestnews/Oneida-Indian-Nation-Congratulates-Cooperstown-Central-School-Board-for-Voting-to-Remove-Redskins-Mascot-196067191.html|archivedate=October 20, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, 2013 school board members of the [[Port Townsend High School]] in [[Port Townsend, Washington]] voted to replace its "Redskins" nickname, logo, and mascot (used since 1926) due to its divisive nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20130625/NEWS/130629988/redskins-dropped-as-team-name-and-mascot-for-port-townsend-high|title='Redskins' dropped as team name and mascot for Port Townsend High School|author=Charlie Bermant|newspaper=Peninsula Daily News|date=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014 the students selected Red Hawks as their new team name.

On December 8, 2014 the [[Oklahoma City]] School Board voted unanimously to remove Redskins as the nickname for [[Oklahoma City Public Schools|Capitol Hill High School]]. The vote came in response to pleas from students and teachers who found the term offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/09/us-usa-oklahoma-redskins-idUSKBN0JN27T20141209| title=Oklahoma City high school drops the name 'Redskins' for its team| author=Heide Brandes| publisher=Reuters| date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day some students of the high school upset by the change protested the school board decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://kfor.com/2014/12/10/oklahoma-city-students-protest-mascot-change/| title=Update: Oklahoma City students protest mascot change| date=December 10, 2014| publisher=KFOR-TV| author=L.

Some members of the audience walked out during the presentation, and one alumni called the presentation "[[propaganda]]" and asserted his opposition to changing the name. Another alumni stated that if any Native Americans did not like the name Redskins they should go to a native school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://okgazette.com/2015/01/06/opinions-over-mascot-clash-at-public-forum/| title=Opinions over mascot clash at public forum| author=Ben Felder| newspaper=Oklahoma Gazette| date=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://newsok.com/american-indian-parents-group-holds-forum-on-capitol-hill-mascot-name-change/article/5382403| title=American Indian parents' group holds forum on Capitol Hill mascot name change| author=Graham Lee Brewer| date=January 6, 2015| publisher=NewsOK}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee selected four possible replacements; Red Hawks, Red Wolves, War Eagles and Nations, with the final decision to be made by a vote of Capitol Hill Students.

The name of the [[Lancaster High School (Lancaster, New York)|Lancaster, New York High School]] team was discussed at a school board meeting in January, 2015. "Of all the words that could be used to describe us, 'Redskin' is the worst, said John Kane, talk show host for the First Voices Indigenous Radio Network". The school has de-emphasized the Redskins name in recent years, eliminating the name and logo from the scoreboard and uniforms. However, two former school board members defend the name, citing it as "a source of community identity, pride and spirit". Kane characterized the defense of the name as having an "[[Archie Bunker]]" mentality. "In this day and age, it's not a celebratory term," said Hilary N. Weaver, associate dean for academic affairs at the [[University at Buffalo]] and co-director of the Immigrant and Refugee Research Institute. "You're a school district, and it's important to look at what you're teaching. … I don't think racism has a place in an educational institution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/lancaster/redskins-nickname-is-debated-in-lancaster-20150121| title=Redskins nickname is debated in Lancaster| author=Karen Robinson| date=January 21, 2015| newspaper=Buffalo News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was again debated at the Lancaster school on March 3, 2015, and was defended by many, but not all current and former students. The President of the [[Seneca Nation of New York]], Maurice John Sr., wrote a letter stating: "Let's be clear — the term "redskin" is a racial slur ... I strongly disagree with those who argue that it is a term of honor and respect. It has no place in today's society." The letter was also addressed to President [[Barack Obama]], Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] and NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] with reference to the Washington NFL team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://wivb.com/2015/03/03/lancaster-prepares-to-debate-redskin-name/| title=Lancaster debates the term Redskin| author=Brittni Smallwood| date=March 3, 2015| publisher=WIVB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two high schools, in [[Akron, New York|Akron]] and [[Lake Shore High School (New York)|Lake Shore]], have cancelled Lacrosse games with Lancaster in support of the Native American opposition to the Redskins name.

Gustine High became the first to implement a change in February, 2016; becoming the "Reds", the name used by the school from 1913 to 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mercedsunstar.com/news/article59921746.html| title=Gustine chooses new mascot after governor bans Redskins | author=Brianna Calix| date=February 11, 2016| publisher=Merced Sun-Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the January 2017 deadline, three of the four schools have complied with the letter of the law but not the spirit, retaining their Native American imagery and behavior, including a female student portraying an Indian Pricess in a floor length war bonnet and fans whopping and tomahawk chopping at games. With the agreement of the local government, Chowchilla has added "Redskins Way" signs to the streets leading to the school and insist they are maintaining a proud tradition that honors Native Americans, even as tribal members state that these practices trivialize and misrepresent the factual history of Native Americans in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://edsource.org/2017/mascot-law-rolls-out-and-schools-obey-the-letter-of-the-law-if-not-the-spirit/575473| title=Mascot law rolls out and schools obey the letter of the law, if not the spirit| date=January 23, 2017| author=Jane Meredith Adams| publisher=EdSource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to change==
===Neshaminy, Pennsylvania===
In 2013, after failing in her appeals directly to [[Neshaminy High School]], a parent, Donna Fann-Boyle (Cherokee-Choctaw) filed a complaint with the [[Pennsylvania]] Human Relations Commission (PHRC) alleging the "Redskins" name is a form of harassment offensive to Native Americans and her then 13-year-old son who attended the school. The school board unanimously voted to ask the commission to dismiss the complaint,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myfoxphilly.com/story/23785675/parent-asks-school-to-change-mascot-name|title=Parent Asks School To Change Mascot Name|date=October 25, 2013|author=Omari Fleming|publisher=Fox News}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November, 2014 the Neshaminy School District has incurred $26,000 in legal fees defending the mascot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/news/communities/hamptons/neshaminy-incurred-k-in-attorney-fees-over-mascot-name-issues/article_81d239b4-2e5a-5718-bda9-09231b56877d.html| title=Neshaminy incurred $26K in attorney fees over mascot name issues| author=Michael Macagnone| publisher=Bucks County Courier Times| date=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PHRC has made a preliminary finding that the name Redskins is "racially derogatory" and creates a "hostile educational environment." The case will now proceed to a hearing by the full commission unless the school district takes steps to remedy the situation, which thus far they have refused to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.buckslocalnews.com/articles/2015/05/04/the_advance/news/doc553fbe5358ac2774244653.txt?viewmode=fullstory| title=State civil rights agency finds Neshaminy's use of 'Redskins' name 'racially derogatory,' could open door for lengthy proceedings| date=May 4, 2015| author=D.E.

====School newspaper====
After hearing Fann-Boyle's and other Native Americans, editors of the student newspaper, the [[Neshaminy High School#Playwickian|Playwickian]], voted 14-7 to stop using the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2013-10-25/news/mc-pa-neshaminy-school-redskin-controversy-20131025_1_student-newspaper-native-americans-editorial|title=Student newspaper to stop using school's 'Redskin' nickname|date=October 25, 2013|author=Christian Menno|newspaper=The Morning Call}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial by the majority stated "The word 'Redskin' is racist, and very much so. It is not a term of honor, but a term of hate" and quoted Chief Bob Red Hawk member of the Lenape Nation as saying "Our children look at us when they hear this term with questions on why people would use this hateful word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://playwickian.com/2918/op-ed/unsigned-editorial-why-we-wont-publish-the-r-word/| title=Unsigned Editorial: Why we won't publish the R-Word| date=October 23, 2013| accessdate=December 21, 2017| publisher=The Playwikian}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial by the minority cited the schools traditions, their intent to honor Native Americans, and public opinion polls in support of keeping and printing the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://playwickian.com/2918/op-ed/unsigned-editorial-why-we-wont-publish-the-r-word/| title=Unsigned Editorial: School mascot: point of pride for high school| date=October 23, 2013| accessdate=December 21, 2017| publisher=The Playwikian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal and the school board president decided that the student newspaper's editorial board did not have the right to refuse to use the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/11/15/neshaminy-high-school-152276|title=Neshaminy High School's Editorial Board Challenged on Nixing 'Redskins'|date=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school board reached a compromise policy in which the name would not be entirely banned, but allowed in editorials and letters to the editor; however the editors of the paper and their attorney maintain that this policy is contrary to state law and the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/news/local/neshaminy-board-passes-controversial-playwickian-policy/article_0f94aa14-3749-586c-930a-7d2e8c91ff78.html|title=Neshaminy board passes controversial Playwickian policy|date=June 26, 2014|author=MICHAEL MACAGNONE|newspaper=The Bucks County Courier Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Playwickian refusal to print the name came to a head when a student in favor of remaining Redskins submitted an editorial, which the paper printed with the name redacted. The principal eventually suspended the paper's faculty adviser, Tara Huber, for two days, and suspended editor-in-chief from her duties. The paper's funding was also cut by the approximate cost of the redacted issue.&lt;ref name="Sinn.20171219"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.splc.org/article/2014/09/playwickian-adviser-student-editor-suspended-for-redskins-ban|title=Playwickian adviser, student editor suspended for defying administrative orders with Redskins ban|author=Anna Schiffbauer|date=September 17, 2014|publisher=Student Press Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faculty adviser, Tara Huber was named Journalism Teacher of the Year in 2014 by the Pennsylvania School Press Association.

Native American names and images are used by teams in other countries, generally those playing American-style sports and copying the imagery of American teams. Several are in Austria and Germany, which have a tradition of [[Native American hobbyism in Germany|Native American hobbyists]]. The controversy is also international, with the ice hockey team in [[Streatham]], England dropping its Redskins nickname in 2016 to become the [[Streatham Redhawks]].

'''Stadion an der Bremer Brücke''' is a [[Stadium|football stadium]] in [[Osnabrück]], [[Germany]]. It is currently used mostly for [[Association football|football]] matches and is the home stadium of [[VfL Osnabrück]].  The stadium holds 16,667 people and was built in 1933.

Since April 1, 2008, demolishing works of the very old North Stand are under way to make way for a modern mostly roofed stand to be built at the site. The club had planned to build an entirely roofed stand; however, there has been controversy with a local resident whose property is situated very close to the ground. As a result about one-third of the construction will be significantly lower than the rest, and the overall capacity will decrease to 16,667, but [[seating capacity]] will rise to 5,728.

'''TennisConnect''' is a software application introduced by the [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] Tennis Industry Association in 2004. The system was developed in response to market research critical of the "then present" state of the industry to connect with [[tennis]] players using technology.

In the years since, TennisConnect has been used by more than 500,000 tennis players who combine to produce more than 12 million page views per month. Tennis Providers have independently published more than 20,000 pages, 600,000 events, and 18 million tennis court reservations using the system.

The TennisConnect system remains at the foundation of the Tennis Industry Association database architecture.  The database has been extended other TIA initiatives including the Tennis Welcome Center project, Cardio Tennis, Tennis Night in America, and Playtennis.com.  Collectively these web services provided by the trade association are called the Growing Tennis System.

There is no cost to any Tennis Provider to use the Growing Tennis System, although "points of entry" are offered by a number of third party suppliers that offer subscription and professional services fees.

The newly developed SaaS partnership program creates opportunities for additional developers to connect to the common database, which in turn is expected to generate more content published by the trade, and greater access available to consumers.

Privacy and branding are key characteristics of the TennisConnect system for providers and consumers. TennisConnect subscriptions must be paid for and the revenue from subscriptions supports the system operations without requiring outside "endorsements" (advertising) or the use and sale of consumer data (profiling / mailing lists) as with other "free" services.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

'''The Lamb Ground''' is a football stadium in the district of Kettlebrook, in [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], [[Staffordshire]], [[England]] and the home of [[Tamworth F.C.]]  It is approximately half a mile south of [[Tamworth railway station]].

==History==
[[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]] spent their first year as a football team at Jolly Sailor ground before making the short move across the [[River Tame, West Midlands|River Tame]] to start the 1934/35 season in the [[Birmingham Combination]] at the Lamb Ground. [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]] have continued to play at the same site ever since, steadily improving the facilities as the Lambs progressed up the non-league football pyramid.

The ground was named after the "Lamb Inn", which stood for many years at the entrance to what is now the ground's car park. The first known use of the site was as a pig farm at the turn of the 19th century. Before [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]] arrived at the Lamb Ground it is believed that Kettlebrook Oakfield F.C. used the ground. In those early days, players had to change in the Lamb Inn and run down to the pitch, but facilities have been slowly built up to include changing rooms and a clubhouse, as well as 'cover' and seating for spectators.

In 1969 the Lamb Ground acquired its floodlights from [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]] and all bar one of the original pylons are still in place to date, one having been removed to make way for the construction of the current Main Stand in 1997. [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] were invited to play a friendly fixture to mark the official switch-on of the floodlights owing to the Gills being Tamworth's first Football League opposition in the [[FA Cup]].

The Main Stand holds 518 while the terraced "Shed" is home to the "Shed Choir" which sometimes provide the team with vocal support. Planning permission has been sought for a new 1,800 seater stand incorporating VIP boxes to take the place of the current Main Stand, its thought the current Main Stand would then be moved to the Castle End of the stadium. However this may have been a smoke screen whilst the team were seriously under performing to try and prevent fans unease at the situation.

[[File:Motherwell volley.jpg|thumb|180px| [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] player [[Brian McLean]] volleys the ball in a match against [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]].]]
A '''volley''' is an air-borne strike in [[association football]], where a player's foot meets and directs the ball in an angled direction before it has time to reach the ground. A volley can be extremely hard to aim and requires good foot-eye coordination and timing.

In general, the volley requires that the player strike the ball with the front of his foot, with the toes pointing downward, ankle locked, and the knee lifted. It is important for most applications to keep the knee high over the ball when struck, and lean slightly forward to keep the shot accurate and keeping it down. Doing so imparts a great deal of [[topspin]] and prevents the ball from flying wildly over the goal if done correctly. Because of the power and spin imparted on the ball, the shot can follow an unpredictable path to goal and prove difficult to defend against.

Used offensively, the volley can play a crucial role in scoring straight goals. Since a volley occurs when the ball is in the air, they often occur in front of goal as a result of a [[Cross (football)|cross]] or a [[Corner kick|corner]].  In this instance, one attacking player passes the ball across the goal in the air, and the other player (either standing in place or in motion) strikes the ball with his foot before it hits the ground.  This is advantageous over a normal strike in that the player does not need to trap the ball, taking an extra touch and allowing the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] a few extra seconds to react.  Generally, the ball is struck on the laces with the toe pointing downward towards goal, though variations such as the [[bicycle kick]] or scissors kick in which the player's body moves in acrobatic fashion are occasionally employed, much to the delight of spectators.

Used defensively, the volley can quickly clear the ball from play and allow the defending team to recover their position.  While less accurate and harder to execute than a normal long pass, the volley is useful for clearing balls that are bouncing towards or away from a defender because he does not need to trap the ball or change directions if he's running towards his own goal.

The volley is used less often for passes, as it is harder to control, though it can often be used to flick the ball on to another player.  In this use, the strike is softer and more controlled than either the shot or the clearance.  Also, the inside of the foot, outside, or even the heel may be used to flick the ball on off of a volley.  When the heel is used to volley the ball over the player's head (from back to front) it is often referred to as a "donkey kick".

A Half Volley is also commonly used, which is when the ball is kicked immediately after it hits the ground. An exquisite example of a half volley is Liverpool FC's Terry McDermott's goal against Spurs at White Hart Lane in 1980. The ball came to Mc Dermott about 6 metres outside the left corner of Spurs' 18 yard box. Mc Dermott struck the ball that arched into the Spurs net leaving the keeper grasping thin air. However, probably the greatest example is that by Luis Suarez, again for Liverpool FC, against Norwich in an English Premier league fixture in 2013. The ball came to Suarez halfway inside the Norwich half approximately 40 metres from goal. Suarez's looping half volley shot gave the keeper no chance as it found the back of the net.
