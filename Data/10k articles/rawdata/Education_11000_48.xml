'''60second Recap''' is an [[education]]al [[video]] project launched in September 2009 to provide 60-second video summaries and [[literary analysis|analysis]] of [[classic literature]]. The site provides one-minute video commentaries on plot, themes, characters, symbols, motifs, and other aspects of books commonly studied in [[secondary school]]s in North America.

A year after its launch, 60second Recap's website offered over 400 videos covering 35 classic literary works and 60 contemporary titles. It had also received more than 4.5 million website visits.&lt;ref name="Gallegus"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallegus|first=Manuel|title=60 Second Literature Recap?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6945704n|newspaper=[[CBS Evening News]]|accessdate=2010-11-30|date=2010-10-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101020162652/http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6945704n| archivedate= 20 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its second year, 60second Recap continued to add to its content library, with new 60second Recap video "albums" of 10-15 individual videos covering various aspects of a work such as ''[[Beowulf]]'' or ''[[Hamlet]]''. The website currently presents approximately 800 videos encompassing 42 classic literary works, and over 250 reviews of contemporary books of potential interest to teenagers.&lt;ref name="JennySawyer"&gt;{{Cite web|title=60second Recap: An Update|url=http://jennysawyer.com/60second-recap-an-update/2013/04/22|accessdate=2013-05-03|publisher=JennySawyer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

60second Recap was created by Peter Osterlund, a former journalist who, while working as a Hollywood screenwriter, began exploring media formats suitable for [[smartphones]] and other handheld devices.  He said he decided to structure his concept around a 60-second video format upon noting that viewer's attention to "small-screen" video tended to lapse after about one minute.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Toppo|first=Greg|title=Reluctant students of the classics, lend me your earbuds!|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-09-07-jenny-sawyer-60-second-recap-classics_N.htm|accessdate=2010-11-30|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media interest in 60second Recap's subsequent launch focused on two novel aspects of its design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Aucoin|first=Don|title=A novel approach|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2009/10/31/a_novel_approach_to_getting_kids_into_classics/|accessdate=2010-11-30|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, 60second Recap offered a new variation on an old form by presenting its study aid material in a video-only format based on Osterlund's 60-second concept. Second, all editorial content was researched and written by a single individual, [[Jenny Sawyer]], a book critic for ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' who also served as 60second Recap's host.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; Sawyer said this approach was intended to help students see 60second Recap not as a "cheat-sheet authority" but as a "conversation-starter" on a given work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Rooney|first=Emily|title=Great literature in 60 Seconds|url=http://www.wgbh.org/programs/Greater-Boston-11/episodes/Nov-3-2009--Great-literature-in-60-Seconds-10021|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]|date=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Video format controversy ==

Some online critics took exception to 60second Recap's video-centric approach.  They argued that 60second Recap's format trivialized [[Elie Wiesel]]'s [[Holocaust]] memoir [[Night (book)|''Night'']] by summarizing its plot and themes in a series of twelve 60-second videos.&lt;ref name=heeb&gt;{{Cite web|title=Holocaust Memoir "Night" Finally Made Complete with Animation|url=http://www.heebmagazine.com/holocaust-memoir-night-finally-made-complete-with-animation/|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=Heeb Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; One journalist contended that 60second Recap-style study videos might encourage students to avoid reading altogether.&lt;ref name=strauss&gt;{{Cite news|last=Strauss|first=Valerie|title=Wiesel's "Night," "Hamlet" in 60 seconds?|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/answer-sheet/literature/i-just-got-a-pitch.html|accessdate=2010-11-30|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classroom acceptance ==

60second Recap won acceptance in schools, however,&lt;ref name="Gallegus"/&gt; and teachers said they found it effective in sparking classroom discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carlin|first=Cali|title=Video Cliff Notes|url=http://www.channelone.com/video/60-second-books/#ooid=JrcDRrMTqIxruj8hxwDJ5FOTBk5lwlOI|newspaper=[[Channel One News]]|accessdate=2010-12-11|date=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 60second Recap was also cited by special education teachers as a pedagogical tool for students who have learning disabilities that interfere with their ability to comprehend written material.&lt;ref name="Ohio Center for Autism"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Best Assistive Technology Tools for 2010|url=http://ocali.org/view.php?nav_id=100&amp;up_folder_id_mov_kaltura=7&amp;up_mov_id=10|accessdate=2010-12-11|publisher=Ohio Center for Autism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry response ==

In 2011, [[CliffsNotes]] announced a joint venture with AOL and reality TV show producer [[Mark Burnett (executive producer)|Mark Burnett]] to introduce its own series of 60-second [[video study guide]] surveys of classic literary works.&lt;ref name=marketplace&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cliff Notes Goes Digital|url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/03/10/pm-cliffsnotes-goes-digital//|accessdate=2011-03-10|publisher=American Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6750">[[Image:AVRButterfly.jpg|thumb|AVR Butterfly Module]]
The '''AVR Butterfly''' is a battery-powered [[single-board microcontroller]] developed by [[Atmel]]. It consists of an Atmel [[Atmel AVR|ATmega169PV]] [[Microcontroller]], a [[liquid crystal display]], [[joystick]], speaker, [[serial port]], [[real-time clock]] (RTC), internal [[flash memory]], and sensors for temperature and voltage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=ATAVRBFLY|title=AVR Butterfly - ATAVRBFLY {{!}} Microchip Technology Inc.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Microchip|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board is the size of a [[name tag]] and has a clothing pin on back so it can be worn as such after the user enters their name onto the LCD.

== Feature set ==

=== LCD ===

The AVRButterfly demonstrates [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] driving by running a [[fourteen-segment display|14 segment]], six alpha-numeric character display. However, the LCD interface consumes many of the [[input/output|I/O]] pins.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/doc4271.pdf|title=AVR Butterfly Evaluation Kit - User Guide|last=|first=|publisher=Atmel Corporation|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CPU &amp; Speed ===

The Butterfly's ATmega169 CPU is capable of speeds up to 8&amp;nbsp;MHz, however it is factory set by software to 2&amp;nbsp;MHz to preserve the button battery life. There are free replacement [[bootloader]]s available that will launch programs at 1, 2, 4 or 8&amp;nbsp;MHz speeds. Alternatively, this may be accomplished by changing the CPU [[prescaler]] in the application code.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Features ===

* ATmega169V AVR 8-bit CPU, including 16 [[kilobyte|Kbyte]] of Flash memory for code storage and 512 [[byte]]s of [[EEPROM]] for data storage
* 100-segment LCD (without backlight)
* 4-[[megabit|Mbit]] (512-Kbyte) AT45 flash memory
* 4-way Mini-Joystick with center push-button
* Light, temperature, and voltage (0-5 V range) sensors (light sensor no longer included due to the [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS directive]])
* Piezo speaker
* Solder pads for user-supplied connectors: 2 8-bit I/O ports, [[In-System Programming|ISP]], USI, [[JTAG]]
* RS232 level converter &amp; interface (Cable and connector provided by end user)
* 3 V battery holder (CR2450 battery included)

=== Software ===

The Butterfly comes preloaded with software that demonstrates many features of the ATmega169, including reading of the ambient light level and temperature and playback of musical notes.  The device has a clothing-pin attached to the back, so it may be worn as a name tag — the "name" may be entered via the joystick or over the RS-232 port, and will scroll across the LCD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Reprogramming ===

The Butterfly can be freely reprogrammed using the same toolchains as for many other AVR controllers, for example using the [[Atmel AVR]] assembly language or the free [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) ''Atmel Studio'' for programming in [[C (programming language)|C]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A pre-installed bootloader allows the board to be re-programmed with a standard [[RS-232]] serial port, requiring no special hardware.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The board also has ISP and [[JTAG]] ports for [[in-circuit programming]] and debugging. All of these interfaces are implemented only as open soldering points, so the addition of some hardware is necessary to make them usable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Butterfly projects and applications ==

Several projects have been built using the Butterfly as a base platform, often with few or no additional parts:
* There's an award-winning educational robot based around the Butterfly called the ''FlutterBot''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flutterbot.com/ FlutterBot] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205112619/http://www.flutterbot.com/ |date=December 5, 2006 }} - An educational robot based on the AVR Butterfly.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Project ''ButtLoad'' offers free plans to convert the Butterfly into a portable AVR-ISP for programming other AVR devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/ButtLoad.php|title=ButtLoad|last=Camera|first=Dean|date=|year=2007|website=|publisher=Four Walled Cubicle|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several plans are available on the web to convert a Butterfly into an MP3 player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brokentoaster.com/butterflymp3/index.html|title=AVR Butterfly MP3|last=|first=|date=18 May 2008|website=www.brokentoaster.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Way with Words''''' is an independent, non-profit, nationwide, weekly public radio show about language, currently broadcast around the United States of America. 

It was produced by [[KPBS-FM|KPBS]] in San Diego from 1998 to 2007 and has since then been produced by Wayword, Inc. The show was originally hosted by authors [[Richard Lederer]] and [[Charles Harrington Elster]]. After five and a half years, Elster left the show and was replaced by journalist and writer [[Martha Barnette]]. In October 2006, Lederer announced his retirement from the show. He was replaced by writer and lexicographer [[Grant Barrett]] in January 2007.

On August 2, 2007, [[KPBS-FM|KPBS]] announced it would stop production of ''A Way with Words''. KPBS said that it did not have the manpower, funds, or expertise necessary to take the show to more stations across the U.S. and Canada. In September 2007, Martha Barnette and Grant Barrett, co-hosts of ''A Way with Words'', along with the show's producer Stefanie Levine, announced that they had created a production company that would continue the show. KPBS has also agreed to continue to broadcast the show. New episodes began airing the weekend of November 24 and 25, 2007. Since then, the number of stations carrying the show has more than quadrupled.

'''''Air Bucks''''' was one of the first [[business simulation game]]s dealing with running an airline. It involves purchasing landing rights for cities around the globe.

In 1993, an enhanced version titled ''Air Bucks v1.2'' was released for the [[Amiga]].

==Gameplay==
The game begins in 1946, after the Second World War. Using default settings, the player controls the airline "Air Bucks" with three AI competitors; all are based in the city of Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue156/100_Air_Bucks_version_1.php|title=Air Bucks version 1.2|last=Olafson|first=Peter|website=www.atarimagazines.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each player purchases landing rights for a surrounding airport not more than 1,000 miles away, as the only plane available at the beginning (the [[Douglas DC-3]]) has a range of 1,000 miles. Usually the first landing rights purchased are in either New York or Washington D.C.  Aside from the initial base airport (Miami by default, but customizable) only two airlines can have landing rights to any one airport.

While waiting for landing rights to be awarded, which takes one month at the beginning of the game and two to three months later on, the player can acquire airplanes and adjust each plane's LOPA (layout of passenger accommodations) by altering the number of first class and coach seats.

Once landing rights are established the player creates a route between two or more cities, sets coach and first class ticket prices, and then assigns planes to the route. The ticket price and service amenities can be constantly adjusted until optimum revenue is generated.

As time progresses, new models of airplanes become available for purchase, such as the Douglas DC-6, de Havilland Comet, Boeing 747, and the Aérospatiale Concorde.

The game's demand model calculates passenger demand for each route based on ticket pricing, plane speed, size of destinations, plane age, service quality (a function of employee wages), advertising spend, aircraft reliability (a function of maintenance spend) and other factors. The game also simulates fuel price fluctuations based on historical [[inflation]] data, and periodically generates weather events and strikes which temporarily close particular airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/120481106/Air-Bucks|title=Air Bucks|website=Scribd|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The default computer companies are "Transglobal Inc", "International GT", and "Great Times". The amount and selection of computer and human players is customizable, as are the company names and logos, starting site, and difficulty.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave ''Air Bucks'' a negative review. The magazine criticized the interface, version 1.0's slow game speed, and poor computer AI and economic model, and concluded "Right now, my feeling is that this flight has been delayed".&lt;ref name="brooks199301"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=102 | title=Impressions' Air Bucks | work=Computer Gaming World | date=January 1993 | accessdate=5 July 2014 | author=Brooks, M. Evan | pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 Impressions released version 1.2, advertising that it was a "''New'' Air Bucks!" with "the features you want", including better [[VGA graphics]], interface, computer AI, and economic model. The company ("Committed to customer satisfaction") offered the upgrade for free to registered owners of the game.&lt;ref name="cgw199304"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=105 | title=Check out the New Air Bucks! | work=Computer Gaming World | date=April 1993 | accessdate=6 July 2014 | pages=41 | type=advertisement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cities in Air Bucks==
Air Bucks represents 96 airport sites: 6 in Australia; 2 in New Zealand; 8 in the South Pacific; 25 in Asia; 7 in Africa; 33 in Europe; 1 in Greenland; 1 in Bermuda; 14 in Latin America; 5 in Canada; and 26 in the United States. While the game includes a number of small historical "technical stop" destinations such as [[Wake Island]], [[Kanton Island|Canton Island]], Gander, the [[Azores]], [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] and [[Recife]], some major cities such as Dubai, Casablanca, Tel Aviv and Brisbane are absent.

Since no more than two airlines can acquire landing rights to any one airport, competition is keen for large-market airports and, early in the game before airplanes have trans-oceanic range, for tech-stop airports.

The '''Alliance High School''' (or '''AHS''') popularly known as "Bush", was one of the first schools in [[Kenya]] to offer secondary school education to Africans. It was founded on 1 March 1926 by the Alliance of Protestant Churches - The Church of Scotland Mission (later known as the [[Presbyterian Church of East Africa]] or PCEA), [[Anglican Church of Kenya|Church of the Province of Kenya]] (CPK), [[Africa Inland Mission|African Inland Church]] (AIC), and the [[Methodist Church]].

The school is situated in [[Kikuyu, Kenya|Kikuyu]], about 22 kilometers (12 miles) from Nairobi's central business district. The school is a 10-minute walk from the [[Alliance Girls High School|Alliance Girls' High School]], which has been its sister school.

Alliance High School has always been ranked within the top ten best schools in each year's National Examinations. It was ranked first in the country from 1960 to 1985. In 1986 it lost its top ranking for the first time in 25 years, slipping to third. It was ranked first in the country in 2005 based on the results of the [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]] (KCSE). In 2006, it was ranked third. In 2009 and 2010, the school emerged top in the KCSE results posting sterling performance. In 2011, the school dropped one place to second. In 2013 the school was on top again with a mean grade of A- beating other famous schools like [[Starehe Boys' Centre and School]]

The school motto is "Strong to Serve". The Old Boys association has a website and a Yahoo group known as Bushfire.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
In the early days of the colonial era in Kenya, the colonialists believed that Africans should not be allowed an education beyond the basic level as they would not benefit from any higher education. The rationale was that Africans were only useful as a source of cheap labour. Missionaries who had been arriving in the country from the beginning of the 20th century strongly opposed this idea. The missionaries had been trying to set up primary schools to provide basic education to Africans, but they faced challenges due to lack of funding. Dr. [[John Arthur]], who was in charge of the Kikuyu mission arranged for a conference with other protestant missions to address these problems. The first meeting took place in 1913 in Kikuyu. Later in the year 1918, the Alliance of Protestant Missions was formed comprising the Church of Scotland Mission, Church of the Province of Kenya, the African Inland Mission and the Methodist Church.

Dr. Arthur pushed the British government to open education to Kenyans and all Africans in all colonies. He believed that Kenyans should be given access to primary, secondary and tertiary level education as a matter of right. His efforts bore fruit when the [[Devonshire White Paper]] was written in 1923. This meant that Africans were also entitled to a quality education. Dr. Arthur realised the need to have new institutions set up. He worked tirelessly, without the government's backing to establish a high school for Africans in Kikuyu. The school was finally established on 1st March 1926 under the auspices of the Alliance of Protestant Missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/African-boys-school-that-dared-defy-colonial-social-order/539444-3341274-8w5r5mz/index.html|title=Alliance: Premier African boys school that dared defy colonial social order|last=Kiereine|first=Douglas|date=11 August 2016|website=Business Daily|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Alliance High School was born.

== Academics ==

=== Admission ===
Every year, 200 students are selected based on academic merit and quota as per the education policy. Academic merit is based on performance of the K.C.P.E exams. Its quota system sees to it that the school admits boys from every county in the country though with bias to students from public schools as the current education policy requires.

Students are admitted on a need-blind basis. At any given time, there are needy students whose tuition and boarding fees are paid by parties other than their parents or guardians. This is thanks to the school’s strong alumni network (the Old Boys Club)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.water.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=142:speech-day-of-alliance-high-school-on-6th-november-2010&amp;catid=55:psspeeches&amp;Itemid=116]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the large number of friends the school has around the world.
[[File:Alliance High School (Kenya), AdminBlock.jpg|alt=Administration block|thumb|Administration Block]]

=== Performance and ranking ===
The school is the highest performing high school in the country academically, always being ranked among the top 10 positions every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shulebora.com/national/alliancehighschool.html|title=Alliance High School : National Schools in Kenya|date=|publisher=Shulebora.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104051123/http://www.shulebora.com/national/alliancehighschool.html|archivedate=2013-11-04|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school holds the country record for most consecutive years holding the pole position in the national exams(1960-1985) . In the K.C.S.E results announced in 2011, the school emerged top in the country. In that same year, the school had more than 100 students scoring a mean grade of A in the national exams. In 2009 and 2010, the school emerged top in the K.C.S.E results posting sterling performance. In 2011, the school was  ranked second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kenyauptodate.blogspot.com/2011/02/boys-shine-in-kcse-exams.html|title=THE LATEST KENYAN NEWS: Boys shine in KCSE exams|author=|date=2011-02-28|publisher=Kenyauptodate.blogspot.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, over 98% of the school’s graduates get admission to Kenyan universities. Some Alliance High alumni have proceeded to join various universities around the world such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Duke University]], [[Williams College]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Others go on to attend universities in Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Kingdom among other countries.

== Faith ==
[[File:Alliance High School Chapel.jpg|alt=The Chapel|thumb|The Chapel]]
Having been founded by Christian missionaries, the school holds Christian values with high esteem. For instance, the school’s badge is embodied with the cross, students say grace before partaking any meal and there is a daily Chapel Service (except on Saturdays) which is compulsory for all Christian students.

However, being a national school that draws students from all over the country, Alliance High School has a small population of non-Christian students, mostly Muslims. These students have the liberty to practise their faith. When the Christian students attend the daily morning chapel service, Muslim students congregate separately to carry out a religious service of their own. Although there is no permanent mosque in the school, there is always a room set aside that serves as a mosque. Due to Islamic [[Sharia]] dietary requirements, Muslim students have separate tables in the dining hall.

The school has an anthem which is sang to mark the end of special occasions such as the Founders day, [[wiktionary:speech day|Speech Day]] or the closing parade of the term. The anthem can also be sang when there is an occasion to celebrate, such as when the K.C.S.E results are released. The anthem is a rendition of hymn 578 of the [[The Lutheran Hymnal|Lutheran Hymnal]], ''Lord, While for All Mankind We Pray''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lutheran-hymnal.com/lyrics/tlh578.htm|title=Lord, While for All Mankind We Pray|last=|first=|date=|website=Lutheran Hymnal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School prayer===
&lt;poem&gt;
Have in thy keeping O lord, our God, this school; 
That its work may be thorough and its life joyful;
That from it may go out, 
Strong in body, mind and character, men who  
In Thy name and with Thy power,
Will serve their fellows faithfully, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alliancehighschool.sc.ke/school-prayer|title=School Prayer|last=|first=|date=|website=Alliance High School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grace ===
For what we are about to receive,

We thank you Lord,

Amen

===School anthem===
&lt;poem&gt;
Lord while for all mankind we pray,
Of every Clime and coast, 
Oh hear us for our native school, 
The school we love the most x3
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Sports==
The school is a participant in the national sports festival. The following games are offered at the school: [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[badminton]], [[basketball]], [[football (soccer)]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[field hockey|hockey]], [[lawn tennis]], [[rugby football]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[table tennis]].

The school has three basketball courts, two football pitches, two hockey pitches, a swimming pool, a handball field, an [[athletics track]] and a gymnasium with table tennis table.

The school's routine includes a games period every weekday from 16:15hrs to 17:40hrs. On Tuesdays the program is suspended for clubs’ and societies’ meetings. There are inter-house sports competitions spread across the three school terms.

During the second school term, a mini Olympics is held in the school. During this event, the thirteen houses compete against each other in track and field events. The winning house receives the Standards Trophy and gets to feast on a bull during the end of term school dinner.

There is also a compulsory [[cross country running|cross-country jog]] on the first weekend of the school term. This event is particularly popular yet unpopular among the students; many approach it with zeal while many an A.H.S student approach the games master with an excuse in an effort to avoid the jog.

==Clubs and societies==
There are over 20 clubs and societies including the Research Club, The Dramatic Society, law and debate club, the MIT launch X, social welfare society, the Scouts Movement, the International Information Exchange Program Club, the school choir, the Science and Robotics Club, the Integrity Club, the Writers’ Club, the Poetry Society, Kiswahili Club, the Model United Nations, the Seventh Day Adventists(S.D.A) Society, the Christian Union, Muslim Association among many others. These clubs usually meet on Tuesdays from 16:16hrs to 17:30hrs.

The Alliance High School Scouts is one of the first troop of African scouts in the continent.

==Exchange program==
The school has several exchange programs but the longest running ones are the Brooks Exchange Program and the Sir John Leeman Exchange Program. There is also the Governor's Exchange Program.

Every year, two form 3 students of outstanding character both inside and outside the classroom are chosen to participate in the Brooks Exchange Program. The two students usually serve as hosts to two other students from [[Brooks School]]. Unlike the Brooks Exchange Program, the Sir John Leeman Exchange Program takes place once every 2 years.

==Houses==
The school has thirteen houses, four of which are newly built(2016), which house almost 1500 students. The houses are, in order of age, and with the reason for the name:
[[File:New Complex at Alliance High School.jpg|thumb|New Complex]]
* Livingstone House: Scottish explorer Dr. [[David Livingstone]].
* Aggrey House: Dr. Aggrey of Achimota
* Wilberforce House: Scottish abolitionist Sir [[William Wilberforce]]
* Grieve House: first principal of the school George Arthur Grieve
* Arthur House: Scottish medical missionary [[John Arthur]]
* Francis House: school’s second principal [[Edward Carey Francis]]
* Smith House: longest serving member of the teaching staff Mr. James Stephen Smith
* Sellwood House: Major Sellwood.
* Campbell House: school's third principal Mr. L.J Campbell.
* Sanders House: the school's fourth principal
ACE Sanders
* Githaiga House: fifth principal-J Githaiga
* Wangai House: sixth principal-E Wangai
*Maneno House: seventh principal- S S Maneno
Many activities within the school are based on the house system. This includes the arrangement at the parade ground where assemblies are conducted every morning and role call parades conducted. Inter house competitions include music and elocution, drama, math contest, Swahili contest, essay writing contest, battle of the blocks writing challenge, cleanliness competitions, and sports such as soccer, rugby, racquet games, swimming, etc.

At the end of every term, during the school dinner, awarding sessions are held where the winning house in every category receives a carton of biscuits. First and second runners up receive half and quarter a carton respectively. The winning house in standards and athletics, K.C.S.E. and cross country is awarded a bull which is slaughtered and offered for a party.

The houses have a committee of form 3 students who run the house's day-to-day activities. The committee is usually chosen by the house prefects and the house master. It is composed mainly of the chairman, vice chairman, secretary, treasurer, vice treasurer, resource manager and activities coordinator. However, houses may have additional positions which vary depending on their need.  In most cases, these committee members end up as the house prefects. However, this trend is changing to incorporate students with impeccable leadership qualities  who did not make it to the house committees into the prefecture body.

Students in these houses are housed in hostels. The hostels are structured into cubicles where four students share one cubicle. The hostels have wash room facilities with hot showers, laundry areas, ironing bays, a common room and open lawns. Due to the current high population old houses have been renovated to house the rapidly growing population.

==Prefects==
Prefects at the school are usually form 4 students who have shown outstanding leadership abilities at the house level. Most of them are chosen from the house committees. During the second term of the academic year, they are appointed to be prefects by the principal after being nominated and vetted by the house masters and current house prefects. They are then put through a rigorous training session by their fourth form counterparts in preparation for running the school the following year.

The prefects are key to the running of the school. It is they who see that the school routine and school rules are adhered to. They have the authority to punish culprits via the prefect’s punishment department. Punishments include washing corridors and rooms, slashing fields and in some extreme cases, working in the school farm or uprooting tree stumps.

[[File:The Alliance High School 2016 Pentagon.jpg|alt=The Pentagon - 2016|thumb|The Pentagon - 2016]]
A total of about 90 prefects are chosen each year and among the 90, 24 of the most outstanding prefects are given top honors in becoming Senior Prefects or Captains. These Captains are allocated various major departments in the school. The school's departments include:

# Dining Hall
# Entertainment
# Games
# Compound
# Library
# Chapel
# IT and Links
# Medical
# Protocol
# Utilities
# Sponsorship
# Academic

Each department has its department members which vary with the demands of the department. Each house similarly produces a House Captain to be assisted by his Dorm Prefects.

The top five captains are referred to as the Pentagon. They are the School Captain, the Deputy School Captain, the Dining Hall Captain, the Entertainment Captain, and the Games Captain. The prefects' body is given a name each year, e.g. Martinets (2014), Autocrats (2015), Acculturates (2016), Desposians (2017), Relictans(2018), and is governed by the School Captain (The Governor General) and the Deputy School Captain (The President).&lt;ref&gt;Alliance High School Official School Magazine, 2010 Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alliance Girls High School==
The Alliance High School maintains strong ties with its sister school, [[Alliance Girls High School]], ever since the latter was founded as the African Girls High School in 1948. Each of the nine houses at the Alliance High School have sister houses at Alliance Girls High School. The houses usually participate in an event called Socials that takes place at the end of first and second terms. There is also a joint Christmas Carol service held in the school chapel towards the end of the third term. On Sunday mornings, Muslim students from the girls’ school usually congregate with their male counterparts at the Alliance High School’s Carey Francis Memorial Lecture Theater. Mail correspondence between the two schools takes place on a daily basis and is free of charge.

==Culture==
[[File:The Old Chapel now the Grieve Library..jpg|thumb|Grieve library]]
The Alliance High School community is rich in culture. The form ones take the unpopular tie test before they can be issued with the school’s blue tie. This test serves to educate the freshmen on the school’s history and current affairs at the school. Upon arrival, every form 1 student is assigned a ‘guardian’ who is a form 2 student that helps the new student find his way around the school in the first few weeks.

The art of 'lifting' is a common practice especially among form two and three students. Lifting is the process of one showing their leadership qualities through various ways so as to be considered for various leadership positions especially as prefects.

Over the years, the school has opened and closed its term calendar on Thursdays. The first Saturday is often marked with a cross-country race. Closing days are characterized by a school dinner on the closing eve, where students are treated to a sumptuous meal and an award ceremony held. The school is then closed early next morning through a final assembly where the students sing the dismissal hymn, "Lord dismiss us with thy blessing."

Thursday is a special day at the Alliance High School. On Thursdays, students conduct hymn practice in the chapel, students speak Swahili, fish is served during dinner, among other activities.

The most popular form of entertainment in the school is the Saturday movies. Every Saturday the entertainment committee which consists of form 2s and 3s and the entertainment department which has about 5 prefects organizes and prepares the Saturday movies plus the Saturday Evening Paper (SEP). School movies held in the school hall were previously charged sh 20 but are now free to all and sundry. However, the most popular movies are the joint movies that are usually held termly with the Alliance Girls’ School. These used to be held at night but have since been changed to afternoons.

The high school life is fun and exciting. Various platforms like the drama and music competitions provide students with a chance to showcase their talents. The Drama Club organizes the biggest Comic Show of the entire year called "Span One" where students simulate the Monday morning School Assembly and try to imitate their teachers. The School Choir also organizes the Music Night which features presentations not only from the choir but also dances from all the communities in the country.

==Uniform==
Boys at the school wear white shirts, khaki shorts, grey stockings with two blue stripes on either side of a red stripe; black or brown shoes; jungle green pullovers and a blue tie. Grey trousers are worn on Sundays, Wednesdays and school events such as on Founders Day Celebrations. Prefects wear ties with red stripes rather than the conventional  blue one.

'''Amber House''' is one of the older two storey villas in [[New Zealand]]'s third founded city of [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] in the top of the [[South Island]] at 46 [[Weka]] Street.

It is a traditional colonial-style construction using native [[Dacrydium cupressinum|Rimu]] and [[Prumnopitys taxifolia|Matai]] timbers with an external [[brick]] [[chimney]] that originally served four large fireplaces.

The original, highly decorated, cast iron [[sewage]] vent pipes are still intact and visible on the exterior of the building.

== Cabragh House School ==
From 1906 until 1927 Amber House housed a "Boarding and Day School for Girls and Little Boys" known as [[Cabragh House|Cabragh House School]] operated by the Hornsby family from [[Ireland]]. [[Edwardian]] [[photograph]]s of both the [http://www.AmberHouse.co.nz/#History scholars and the school have been preserved.]

== Original wallpaper ==
[[Image:Artichoke wallpaper Morris and Co J H Dearle.jpg|frame|left|"Artichoke" wallpaper designed by [[John Henry Dearle]] for [[Morris &amp; Co.]], ''circa'' 1897 ]] Amber House preserves a small section of its original unfaded [[Wallpaper pattern#Group p1|wallpaper]] from the late 19th century that was revealed during recent renovations.

Because New Zealand has had for the last two centuries (and continues to have) the highest [[ultra violet]] exposure levels of any populated region on earth it is extremely rare to find used (as opposed to unused roll) examples of [[Victorian era]] wallpaper in New Zealand that have not faded badly.

== Earthquake resilience ==
[[Image:BrickMakingTurnOfTheCentury.jpg|thumb|right|100|Victorian brick making]]Of particular interest is the tall brick chimney on the west side of Amber House that has survived major [[earthquakes]] in 1929 ([http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/NaturalHazardsAndDisasters/HistoricEarthquakes/5/en   ''Arthur's Pass'' and ''Murchison'']), 1968 ([http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/NaturalHazardsAndDisasters/HistoricEarthquakes/10/en ''Īnangahua'']) and 1994 without a single crack blemishing its surface.

There has been speculation that, because deep below Amber House are separate beds of [[shale]] and [[sand]], these strata have acted like a naturally occurring analogue of the [[Earthquake resistant structure#Wood frame|earthquake resistant]] [http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/history-of-parliament/places-and-spaces base isolators] of the [[New Zealand Parliament Buildings#Parliament House|Parliament House]] in [[Wellington]] to reduce the incidence of [[Seismic wave#Types of seismic waves|short periodicity lateral waves]] at Amber House during earthquakes.

The evident resilience of this old chimney means that it is even possible that it pre-dates the 1893 magnitude 6.9 Nelson earthquake that moved the spire of [http://www.nelsoncathedral.org/ Christ Church Cathedral in Nelson] nearly a metre out of the vertical plane.

== Old English Walnut tree ==
[[Image:Juglans regia Broadview.jpg|thumb|right|[[English Walnut]] Tree in late summer showing the fruits]]
Amber House has the oldest [[English walnut|English Walnut tree (''Juglans regia'')]] in the South Island in the back garden. Although old, this venerable tree is relatively small since, when it was originally planted, it would have been only yards from the original shoreline and on very sandy soil with the roots lacking an adequate water supply. This desiccation has resulted in an almost [[Bonsai]] like effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8316">The '''American Opportunity Tax Credit''' is a partially refundable [[tax credit]] first detailed in Section 1004 of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crandall-Hollick |first1=Margot L. |title=The American Opportunity Tax Credit: Overview, Analysis, and Policy Options |date=June 4, 2018 |publisher=Congressional Research Service, |location=Washington, DC |url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42561/19 |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act specifies:

# Provisions were originally specific to tax years 2009 and 2010, later extended, and finally made permanent by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for the first 4 years of post-secondary education.
# Increases the [[Hope Scholarship Credit]] to 100 percent qualified tuition, fees and course materials paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year not to exceed $2,000, plus 25 percent of the next $2,000 in qualified tuition, fees and course materials. The total credit does not exceed $2,500.
# 40% of the credit is refundable.
# This tax credit is subject to a phase-out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income in excess of $80,000 ($160,000 for married couples filing jointly).

The act directs several [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] studies:
# Coordination with non-tax student financial assistance;
# Coordinate the credit allowed under the Federal Pell Grant program to maximize their effectiveness at promoting college affordability;
# Examine ways to expedite the delivery of the tax credit;
# With the Secretary of Education, study the feasibility of requiring including community service as a condition of taking their tuition and related expenses into account.

==History==
Originally proposed by President [[Barack Obama]] to help students and families pay for [[post-secondary education]], the proposal called for a $4000 credit in exchange for 100 hours of [[community service]].  The stated goal of the credit was to, "cover two-thirds the cost of tuition at the average public college or university and make community college tuition completely free for most students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barackobama.com/issues/education/ |title=Education |publisher=Obama for America |accessdate=2009-01-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121085852/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/education/ |archivedate=21 January 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===H.R.106: The American Opportunity Tax Credit Act of 2009===
On January 6, 2009, Congressman [[Chaka Fattah]] introduced H.R.106, The American Opportunity Tax Credit Act of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fattah.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=34&amp;parentid=32&amp;sectiontree=32,34&amp;itemid=346 |title=News Release |publisher=Chaka Fattah |accessdate=2009-02-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130025625/http://fattah.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=34&amp;parentid=32&amp;sectiontree=32%2C34&amp;itemid=346 |archivedate=30 January 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In brief, the proposed act specified

# Any full-time college or university student is eligible.
# According to the IRS, the American Opportunity Credit cannot be taken by a taxpayer if he has a felony drug conviction.
# A $4000 refundable&lt;ref&gt;A "refundable" tax credit is an amount deducted from owed taxes; however, if no taxes are owed, the amount is still paid (refunded) to the taxpayer&lt;/ref&gt; tax credit in exchange for 100 hours of community service. This information is not supported by the link below. This proposal was not passed.
# Community service must be with either a governmental unit, hospital, or [[501(c)3 organization]]. This information is not supported by the link below. This proposal was not passed.
# The Secretary of Education will be responsible for verifying community services requirements. This information is not supported by the links below. This proposal was not passed.

On January 27, 2009, in the Rayburn House Office Building, Congressman Fattah convened a Congressional Roundtable, "Igniting Public Service and Securing College Access: the American Opportunity Tax Credit, H.R. 106". The panel was keynoted by Former Senator [[Harris Wofford]] and included Karen Kaskey ([[PennSERVE]]), Michelle Cooper ([[Institute for Higher Education Policy]]), David Baime ([[American Association of Community Colleges]]), Quyen (Arana) Wickham ([[K20 Center]], [[University of Oklahoma]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/tax-credit-prompts-questions/article/3342241|title=News Article|publisher=Daily Oklahoman|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Reginald Williams ([[Benjamin Banneker Academic High School]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fattah.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=34&amp;parentid=32&amp;sectiontree=32,34&amp;itemid=359 |title=News Release |publisher=Chaka Fattah |accessdate=2009-02-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130025841/http://fattah.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=34&amp;parentid=32&amp;sectiontree=32%2C34&amp;itemid=359 |archivedate=30 January 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===H.R. 4853: Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010===
The '''Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010''' ({{USPL|111|312}}, 124 Stat. 3296, {{USBill|111|H.R.|4853}}), was passed by the [[United States Congress]] on December 16, 2010 and signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] on December 17, 2010.&lt;ref name="wh-taxcut"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/taxcut | title=Tax Cuts, Unemployment Insurance and Jobs | publisher=[[The White House]] | accessdate=December 17, 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218050919/http://www.whitehouse.gov/taxcut | archivedate=18 December 2010 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other things, the bill extends the American Opportunity Tax Credit for tax years 2011 and 2012.

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 made the American Opportunity Tax Credit permanent.

The [[Student and Family Tax Simplification Act (H.R. 3393; 113th Congress)]], a bill that passed the House on July 24, 2014, would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to consolidate several different education tax incentives into an expanded American Opportunity Tax Credit.&lt;ref name=AccountingTodayCohn&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohn|first1=Michael|title=House Passes Student Tax Credit Simplification Bill|url=http://www.accountingtoday.com/news/government-news/house-passes-student-tax-credit-simplification-bill-71453-1.html|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=Accounting Today|date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=3393allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3393 - All Actions|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3393/all-actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Opportunity Tax Credit, under this legislation, would provide a maximum credit of $2,500.&lt;ref name=MarcosTaxCredit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House passess tax credit for college expenses|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/213291-house-passes-tax-credit-for-college-expenses|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Critics have complained that complexity and restrictions on eligibility make the actual benefits per post-secondary student much lower than the theoretical maximum, and that even with tax credits and other subsidies, higher education remains tax-disadvantaged compared to other investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn = 2551567|title = The Knowledge Tax|last = Simkovic|first = Michael|date = 2015|journal = University of Chicago Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simkovic|first=Michael|date=2016|title=Taxes, Subsidies, and Knowledge: A Reply to Professor Oei|ssrn=2761682|journal=University of Chicago Law Review Dialogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells Prize.&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, Deirdre. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6RAJq7enhoAC&amp;pg=PA350 ''Measurement and Meaning in Economics: The Essential Deirdre McCloskey''], ed. [[Stephen Ziliak|Stephen Thomas Ziliak]] (Cheltenham, UK, and Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing, 2001), 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, McCloskey became an assistant professor of economics at the [[University of Chicago]], where she stayed for 12 years, gaining tenure as an associate professor in economics in 1975, and an associate professorship in history in 1979.  Her work at Chicago is marked by her contribution to the cliometric revolution in economic history, and teaching generations of leading economists Chicago Price Theory, a course which culminated in her book ''The Applied Theory of Price''.&lt;ref name=price&gt;{{cite web|last=McCloskey|first=Deirdre|title=The Applied Theory of Price|url=http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/docs/price.pdf|work=PDF|publisher=Deirdre McCloskey.com|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, at the suggestion of Wayne Booth in English at Chicago, she turned to the study of rhetoric in economics.  Later at the [[University of Iowa]], McCloskey, the John Murray Professor of Economics and of History (1980–99), published ''The Rhetoric of Economics'' (1985) and co-founded with John S. Nelson, Allan Megill, and others an institution and graduate program, the ''Project on Rhetoric of Inquiry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People |url=http://poroi.grad.uiowa.edu/board-of-directors |website=Project on Rhetoric of Inquiry (2008–2015) |publisher=The University of Iowa |accessdate=April 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411204451/http://poroi.grad.uiowa.edu/board-of-directors |archivedate=April 11, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; McCloskey has authored 16 books and nearly 400 articles in her many fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=Matt|title=Economist Deirdre McCloskey: playing both sides of the street|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/economist-deirdre-mccloskey-playing-both-sides-of-the-street-20131201-2ygwu.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=April 5, 2013|date=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her major contributions have been to the [[economic history of Britain]] (19th-century trade, modern history, and medieval agriculture), the quantification of historical inquiry ([[Cliometrics]]), the rhetoric of economics, the rhetoric of the human sciences, economic methodology, virtue ethics, [[feminist economics]], [[heterodox economics]], the role of mathematics in economic analysis, and the use (and misuse) of significance testing in economics, and, in her trilogy "The Bourgeois Era,"&lt;ref name=books/&gt; the origins of the Industrial Revolution.

==''Bourgeois'' era==
Her book ''The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce''&lt;ref name=BV&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCloskey|first1=Deirdre|title=Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an age of Commerce|date=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first of a planned series of books about the world since the Industrial Revolution—the Bourgeois Era—and was published in 2006. McCloskey argued that the bourgeoisie, contrary to its self-advertised faith in prudence only, believes in all [[seven virtues]].

The second, ''[[Bourgeois Dignity]]: Why Economics Can't Explain the Modern World'' was published in 2010, and argued that the unprecedented increase in human welfare of the 19th and 20th centuries, from three dollars per capita per day to over 100 dollars per day, issued not from capitalist accumulation but from innovation.

The third, ''Bourgeois Equality: How Ideas, Not Capital or Institutions, Enriched the World'' appeared in 2016.&lt;ref name=books&gt;{{cite web|last=McCloskey|first=Deirdre|title=Books by Deirdre McCloskey|url=http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/books/index.php|publisher=Deirdre McCloskey.com|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCloskey expanded her argument, coining the term "Great Enrichment" to describe the unprecedented gains in human welfare of the 19th and 20th centuries. She reiterated her argument that the enrichment came from innovation and not from accumulation as argued by many from [[Karl Marx]] to [[Thomas Piketty]].

==Personal life==
McCloskey is the eldest child of [[Robert G. McCloskey (professor)|Robert McCloskey]], a professor of government at [[Harvard University]], and the former [[Helen Stueland]], a poet.

McCloskey was born as Donald McCloskey, and this was the name she was known by for the first three decades for her research career. Married for thirty years, and the parent of two children, she made the decision to transition from male to female in 1995, at the age of 53, writing about her experience in a ''New York Times'' Notable Book of the Year, ''Crossing: A Memoir'' (1999, University of Chicago Press).&lt;ref name="crossing"&gt;{{cite web

The book describes her new life, following sex-reassignment surgery, continuing her career as a female academic economist.

McCloskey advocates on behalf of the rights of persons and organizations in the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Learn Liberty|title=Trans Talks: Series Trailer |date=2015-11-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym1oxt-q4DQ&amp;list=PL-erRSWG3IoAmDJLCh5Q9yaN0xC_7x2Z9|accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a key person in the [[Blanchard, Bailey, and Lawrence theory controversy]] and in the debate over [[J. Michael Bailey]]'s book ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', both regarding the reasons why transsexual women desire a male to female transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Criticism of a Gender Theory, and a Scientist Under Siege | first=Benedict |last=Carey |newspaper=New York Times |date=2007-08-21 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/21/health/psychology/21gender.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5124&amp;en=0c11623b4c191f82&amp;ex=1345348800&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCloskey has described herself as a "literary, quantitative, postmodern, free-market, progressive [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]], Midwestern woman from Boston who was once a man. Not 'conservative'! I'm a Christian libertarian."&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|last=McCloskey|first=Deirdre|title=Informal Biographical Remarks|url=http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/main/bio.php|publisher=deirdremccloskey.com|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''diploma''' is a certificate or deed issued by an educational institution, such as college or university, that testifies that the recipient has successfully completed a particular course of study. The word diploma also refers to an academic award which is given after the completion of study in different courses such as diploma in higher education, diploma in graduation or diploma in post graduation etc. Historically, it can also refer to a charter or official document,&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/diploma|title=Diploma|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus [[diplomatic]],&lt;ref name=diplomatic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/diplomatic|title=Diplomatic|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[diplomat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/diplomat|title=Diplomat|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[diplomacy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/diplomacy|title=Diplomacy|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; via the ''Codex Juris Gentium Diplomaticus''.&lt;ref name=diplomatic/&gt;

The diploma (as a document certifying a qualification) may also be called a '''testamur''', [[Latin]] for "we testify" or "certify" (testari), so called from the word with which the certificate begins;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/testamur|title=Testamur|work=Collins Dictionary|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is commonly used in Australia to refer to the document certifying the award of a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monash.edu/graduations/get-ready/documents/award-degree-certificate|title=Testamur (degree certificates)|publisher=[[Monash University]]|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ask.unimelb.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/5964/~/my-graduation-certificate/|title=My Graduation Certificate|publisher=[[University of Melbourne]]|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uow.edu.au/student/graduation/testamurs/index.html|title=Testamur (certificate)|publisher=[[University of Wollongong]]|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, this document can simply be referred to as a degree certificate or graduation certificate, or as a '''parchment'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parchment|title=Parchment|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certificate that a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate receives is also called a diploma.

The term diploma is also used in some historical contexts, to refer to documents signed by a King affirming a grant or tenure of specified land and its conditions (see [[Anglo-Saxon Charters]] and [[Diplomatics]]).

==Usage==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], there are three varieties of Diploma currently recognized by the [[Australian Qualifications Framework]] (AQF):
* a "Diploma", a qualification granted by [[Australian Qualifications Framework#Vocational Education and Training and Higher Education sectors|vocational education and training]] (VET) sector or university. It is typically completed with 12 to 18 months of full-time study. When accepted for credit as part of a bachelor's degree, it is usually deemed to be equivalent to the first year of the degree.
* an "Advanced Diploma", which is equivalent to an Australian "[[Associate Degree]]".
* a "Graduate Diploma", which is undertaken after completing a bachelor's degree (or being deemed to have equivalent knowledge). This can be in a field other than that covered by said degree (e.g., the [[Graduate Diploma of Education]] necessary to become a school teacher in most Australian states). It can also be a coursework-only qualification undertaken as additional study in a specialisation within one's degree area.

The "Vocational Graduate Diploma" was a short lived AQF qualification equivalent to the "Graduate Diploma", intended to be delivered exclusively in the VET sector. On January 1, 2015, all such qualifications being offered lost the word "Vocational" from their title. [http://www.asqa.gov.au/news/2629/retitling-of-vocational-graduate-diplomas-and-vocational-graduate-certificates.html]

===Canada===
In [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], diplomas are awarded by colleges of applied arts and technology whereas [[bachelor degree]]s are awarded by universities.  In Canada, depending on the provincial legislation, there may also be a difference between a college and a university.

===Hong Kong===
In [[Hong Kong]], Advanced Diploma/Certificate (Qualifications Frameworks Level 4), Professional Diploma/Certificate (Qualifications Frameworks Level 4), [[Higher Diploma]], and [[Associate Degree]] are below the level of the [[Bachelor Degree]]. 

[[Academic certificate|Certificate]] (not [[Post-Graduate Certificate]]) and Diploma (Below Qualifications Frameworks Level 4) are below the level of Advanced or Professional Diploma/Certificate (Qualifications Frameworks Level 4), Higher Diploma or Associate Degree. 

[[Postgraduate Certificate]]s and [[Postgraduate Diploma]]s are usually granted after the Bachelor Degree. It's more vocational oriented than a Master's Degree.

[[Postgraduate Diploma]] or PGD are ranked higher than the [[Bachelor's degree]] as they are completed after graduation. These are normally a year's worth of coursework after a university degree.

There are two types of diplomas/certificate issuance which are issued in formal education sector &amp; non formal education sector. Formal education sector diploma/certificates are issued by govt. approved/recognized institution, colleges and universities etc. and non formal education sector diploma/certificates are issued by [[NGOs]], companies and societies etc. outside formal education sector.

===Ireland===

It was at the same level as the ordinary bachelor's degree and below the honours [[Bachelor's degree]], whilst the [[Higher Diploma]] is taken after the bachelor's degree. There is [[BTEC Extended Diploma]] also after which one gets progression to a Degree(University).

===Latin America===
In [[Mexico]] and other Latin American countries, a diploma may be awarded for short courses of vocational training. The university-issued diplomas finalizing higher education are most often called ''título'' (title) or ''certificado'' (certificate). A "Diplomado" can also be a short, specialized executive education program for experienced professionals.

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]], a diploma is a specific academic award usually earned in professional/vocational courses e.g. [[Diploma in Engineering]], [[Diploma in Nursing]], Diploma in Pharmacy etc. Engineering diploma is called [[Diploma of Associate Engineering]] (DAE) and is concentrated for the area of study, e.g., [[Electronics Engineering]], [[Electrical Engineering]], [[Civil Engineering]] etc. DAE holders are often called associate engineers in Pakistan.

[[Postgraduate Diploma]] or PGD are ranked higher than the [[Bachelor's degree]] as they are completed after graduation. These are normally a year's worth of coursework after a university degree.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, Diplomas can be a 3 year program offer by the various Polytechnics (e.g. Nanyang Polytechnic / Singapore Polytechnic) . Other Private Schools also offers Diplomas program for 1 year. (e.g. Kaplan / MDIS/ PSB Academy) In Singapore, Diploma Qualifications is able to land you in a job to start your Career. However, many people will move on to Bachelor's Degree Studies. Diplomas' Certifications in Singapore are well recognised by various other countries, due to Singapore High Educational Standards.  Even Singapore Technical schools (ITEs) offers Diploma courses: www.ite.edu.sg/wps/portal/fts.admission.dip

===Spain===
In the [[Kingdom of Spain]], university diplomas are issued in the name of the [[King]]. As such, they are Public Official documents, strictly regulated and protected by the law. They are internationally recognized by the [[Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents|Hague Convention]] of October 5, 1961.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[UK]], ''diploma'' can refer to several different types of qualification. A Diploma can be a qualification worth 37 or more [[Credit Accumulation and Transfer Scheme|credits]] on the [[Regulated Qualifications Framework]], e.g. Entry Level Diploma, Level 3 Diploma. The [[Diploma of Higher Education]] is a higher education award below the standard of a bachelor's degree, at the same level as a [[Foundation Degree]]. The [[Higher National Diploma]] is a vocational qualification at the same level. A [[Graduate Diploma]] is a one-year qualification at bachelor's degree level, normally taken by those who have already obtained a degree. A [[Postgraduate Diploma]] is an award at the level of a master's degree, but normally taking less time to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels|title=What qualification levels mean|website=Gov.uk|date=25 October 2016|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities may offer other qualifications, such as the [[University of Cambridge]]'s Undergraduate Diploma (a 1-year, part-time cost at the same level as a Diploma of Higher Education)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate-certificates-and-diplomas|title=Undergraduate Certificates and Diplomas|publisher=University of Cambridge|website=Institute of Continuing Education|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Advanced Diploma (equivalent to a Graduate Diploma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/graduate/diploma/|title=Advanced Diploma in Economics|publisher=University of Cambridge|website=Faculty of Economics|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document certifying the award of a degree is normally called a degree certificate in the UK, and details are printed in English, not in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=It has not been practice for UK providers to issue degree certificates in Latin for at least 10 years. Contemporary certificates are in English. Latin versions are occasionally issued as mementos, but are supplementary to the English version.|website=Higher Education Degree Datacheck|url=http://cdn.prospects.ac.uk/pdf/Advice%20and%20Guidance%20on%20Degree%20Fraud%20for%20HE%20Providers.pdf|title=Advice and Guidance on Degree Fraud|publisher=Prospects|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the USA, the word ''diploma'' usually refers to the actual document received at the end of high school, undergraduate studies, or graduate/professional school. This can lead to some confusion when persons who obtained US degrees are presenting their academic credentials in other countries.

Diploma also can refer to a specific academic or training award. An example of the former is in the field of Nursing where the [[Diploma in Nursing]] was offered by hospital based schools.

In an even wider fashion, a [[diplomat]] can refer to a person holding a specific accreditation.
It can also mean what colleges will be willing to take you in freshman year of college.

===International===
The [[IB Diploma Programme|International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma]] is a pre-university qualification normally taken by students in the final two years of [[high school]].&lt;ref name="IBDiploma"&gt;[http://www.ibo.org/diploma/ "International Baccalaureate] Diploma Programme". Retrieved 2007-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugen von Boeck''' (July 13, 1823 – January 31, 1886) was a German [[educator]] and [[scientist]] who lived in [[Chile]], [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] sending and publishing the results of his research in [[Europe]] during the second half of the 19th century.

== Birth and education ==
He was born in [[Kempten im Allgäu]], [[Germany]] to the heart of a catholic and noble family of the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], in 1823.  His parents were Alois von Boeck and Honoria von Bannwarth.  Orphan of both parents by the age of 8, his care was entrusted to his paternal uncle, the Priest Francis Salesius von Boeck, who saw about that he, his three brothers and sister received proper education. After his studies in Institutes run by the [[Order of St. Benedict]] in [[Augsburg]] and the [[Jesuit]] [[University of Dillingen]], in [[Dillingen an der Donau]], having specialized his scientific formation in the fields of [[Philosophy]], [[Zoology]], and [[Philology]], he was called to be a professor in [[Munich]] at the age of 23. He converted to [[Protestantism]].

== Migration to South America ==
In 1852, following the impulse to take his knowledge to other regions, he traveled to [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]], Chile in response to a request for educationists that was published in his native country. The Hamburger vessel “Hermann” transported him to the New World along with his fellow countrymen who took their technical formation to their new home; among farmers, bakers, carpenters and mechanics, he was the only “[[erudite]]” among the passengers.&lt;ref&gt;List of Immigrants of the “Hermann” vessel, 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; On board the ship he met and married Adelheid Kapff, his companion until death. She was the daughter of a Cavalry Master in [[Württemberg]] and was traveling with a one-year-old son named Adolf.
In the mentioned city, he was professor and director of the “Liceo de Valdivia” (high school) until the year 1861. His children Emma, Albert, Clara and Eugen were all born there. He never restricted his work as an investigator and it was in Valdivia that he wrote his first treatise on [[ornithology]], passion he shared with the German scientist and friend of his, Dr. Rudolf Phillipi.
Later, he moved to [[Arequipa]], Peru with a contract for the "Harmsen" Commercial House and once concluded, took his family to live in the city of [[Tacna]], where he took part in the foundation of the “German School”.
Due to the renown the school achieved and the fame of the illustrious educator that surpassed the frontiers of Peru, he received the petition of being the founding Director of the first private school in the city of [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia in 1868: the “2 de Mayo” elementary school.
Besides his work in this entity, he gave private lessons of languages and science. Further on, the authorities of Cochabamba realized that they were not making the most of the talent he had for teaching. Soon he was invited to be Counselor of Instruction, the first Director of the “Bolivar” elementary school, teacher and finally Director of the “Sucre” elementary school, position he held until his death.

== Publications ==
He would not restrict his work to education, but permanently performed study and research. During his stay in Cochabamba, he published countless articles in the local press, being in charge of the [[meteorological]] column of the “El Heraldo" newspaper. He traveled around the country mainly observing the ornithological fauna. He carried out important deliveries of the results of his observations to scientific societies in Europe, which in turn published them, giving them the deserved value for the time and effort employed in their preparation. About this he commented: “the stay here is costly because it is difficult to receive communications, there are few libraries and everything is very modest.” &lt;ref&gt;Eugen von Boeck in a letter to Dr. Rudolph Phillipi in Chile, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did not stop him from making a valuable contribution to both culture and science. Among others works, he published ''Seven Liberal Arts in the Middle Ages'', ''Trip to the Araucania'', ''Treatise on Physical Geography'', ''Quechua'' and ''Ornithology of the Valley of Cochabamba, Bolivia and its Surroundings'', being the latter the first meaningful scientific work in the branch of ornithology written on this region.
== Final years ==
His wife died in 1885, marking a crucial moment in his life. Referring to this event, he wrote a friend: “it is a deep pain that I have not overcome, many times I find myself lonely and I must render all my energy to overcome this lethargic situation.” &lt;ref&gt;Eugen von Boeck in a letter to Dr. Rudolph Phillipi in Chile, 1885.&lt;/ref&gt;
Death met him in the year of 1886, in full exercise of his duties. The institutions in which he served, the university and municipal authorities, the noteworthy citizens, the German colony and the “five or six thousand children” he educated, rendered him a worthy posthumous homage before his grave.  As “El Heraldo” indicated in the chronicle published on occasion of his funeral: “Few deaths have been felt as much as this”. &lt;ref&gt;El Heraldo, February 2, 1886.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Figaro Systems, Inc.''' is an American company that provides  seatback and [[wireless]] titling [[software]] and system installations to [[opera houses]] and other music performance venues worldwide. The company is based in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], New Mexico. It was established in 1993 &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Webb, “Opera Subtitle Firm Eyes New Game,” ''New Mexico Business Weekly'', Nov. 21, 2003 [http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2003/11/24/story2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
by Patrick Markle, [[Geoff Webb]], and Ron Erkman  &lt;ref name="figaro-systems.com"/&gt; and was the first company to provide [[assistive technology]] that enables individualized, simultaneous, multi-lingual [[dialogue]] and [[libretto]]-reading for audiences.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/DocPrint.aspx?DocID=1P2:115622912 David Belcher, “Nothing Lost in Translation: [[Video]] system allows patrons to read words on chair backs,”] ''Albuquerque Journal'', June 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Figaro Systems grew out of a conversation in 1992 among three opera colleagues: Patrick Markle, at that time Production Director of The [[Santa Fe Opera]], Geoffrey Webb, Design Engineer for the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York, and Ronald Erkman, then a technician for the Met. At that time, opera houses had two options for the display of libretto and dialogue subtitles: projection onto a large screen above the stage or onto smaller screens throughout the theatre. Typically, the translation was in a single language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2005/04/11/story5.html?q=Figaro%20Systems Dennis Domrzalski, "Figaro: Eyes translate when ears don't get it",] ''New Mexico Business Weekly'', April 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] had recently been enacted; Markle was trying to solve the problem of venues which lacked accessibility to patrons with disabilities, including the profoundly [[deaf]].  Markle, Webb, and Erkman devised the first [[prototype]] of a personal seatback titling device and [[John Crosby (conductor)|John Crosby]], then General Director of The [[Santa Fe Opera]], saw its potential for opera patrons.&lt;ref name="figaro-systems.com"&gt;[http://www.figaro-systems.com/about.php  Figaro Systems Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Markle, Webb, and Erkman were further reinforced by their understanding of technology’s role in remediating the physical barriers people encounter, worldwide, which frustrate or prevent their access to the visual performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://figarosystems.com/linkdownloads/052007_figaro_auditoria_article.pdf “[[User-friendly]] art: In-seat text displays that subtitle and translate”, ''Auditoria'', May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Markle, Webb, and Erkman applied for and were granted [[patent]]s for their invention.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=11&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=figaro.ASNM.&amp;OS=AN/figaro&amp;RS=AN/Figaro  United States Patent 5,739,869, "Electronic libretto display apparatus and method," issued April 14, 1998. [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/pa/News/050701.html  Los Alamos Laboratory, ''Daily News Bulletin'', May 7, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Philanthropist and investor [[Alberto Vilar]] counted Figaro Systems among the companies in which he was a majority shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/features/5616/ [[Robert Hilferty]], "A Knight at the Opera," ''[[New York Magazine]]'', January 14, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/3490/Vilar-Alberto-1940-Investor-Philanthropist-Privileges-Wealth.html  "Alberto Vilar: The Privileges of Wealth," ''The Free Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;  He donated the company's [[electronic libretto]] system to European venues including the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[London]], La Scala's [[Teatro degli Arcimboldi]] opera houses in [[Milan, Italy|Milan]], Italy, [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]] in [[Barcelona, Spain|Barcelona]], Spain, and the [[Wiener Staatsoper]] in [[Wien]], [[Austria]]. As a consequence of his failures to pay promised donations, most of these companies lost money.

In 2005 the Met charged the New Mexico company with unlawfully using its name in advertising promoting its "Simultext, system which defendant claims can display a simultaneous translation of an opera as it occurs on a stage and that defendant represented that its system is installed at the Met." &lt;ref&gt;[http://classactionlitigation.com/library/consumerlaw2006update.html#_edn173#_edn173 Timothy E. Eble, ''Class Action Litigation Information''] on classactionlitigation.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products and technology==
The company’s products are known variously as seat back titles, [[surtitles]],
&lt;ref&gt;[http://app1.kuhf.org/houston_public_radio-news-display.php?articles_id=20614 Eric Skelly, "Surtitles at the Opera," ''Public Radio News and Information in Houston, Texas'', KUHF 88.7 FM Houston Public Radio] on app1.kuhf.org/&lt;/ref&gt; [[electronic libretto]] systems, opera supertitles, projected titles, and libretto translations.

Opera venues have utilized the system to display librettos in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandia.gov/news-center/news-releases/2005/tech-trans/smbusiness.html "Sandia helps 278 state businesses in 2004 through New Mexico Small Business Assistance Program," Sandia National Laboratories, Sandia Corporation, March 22, 2005] on sandia.gov&lt;/ref&gt; although the software enables the reading of the libretto in any [[written language]].
&lt;ref name="entertanmentengineering.com"&gt;[http://www.entertanmentengineering.com/v4.issue04/page.06.html  “Giving the Opera a New Voice,”] ''Entertainment Engineering," Volume 4, Issue 2, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Translation is provided by one screen and delivery system per person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.figarosystems.com  Figaro Systems Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, but not in all cases, the system is permanently installed along the backs of rows of seats. Each screen is positioned so that the text is clearly visible to each user. The displays were initially available in [[vacuum fluorescent display]], ([[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]]) and, in 2000, [[liquid crystal display]], ([[LCD]]) was used. In 2004 the displays became available with [[organic light-emitting diode]], ([[OLED]]) screens.  Each type of display provides the same text information and program annotation on eight channels simultaneously, may be turned off by the user, and is user-operated with a single button. The software is capable of supporting venues’ existing systems as well as Figaro Systems' "Simultext" system. The software enables cueing of each line as it is sung, and it appears instantly on the screen.&lt;ref name="entertanmentengineering.com"/&gt;

The company builds fully [[modular]] systems including its [[wireless]] [[handheld]] screens 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=3&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=figaro.ASNM.&amp;OS=AN/figaro&amp;RS=AN/Figaro  United States Patent 6,760,010. "Wireless electronic libretto display apparatus and method," issued July 6, 2004:] United States Patent and Trademark Office Patent Full-Text and Image Database&lt;/ref&gt; for users who cannot use seatback systems, for example people in [[wheelchair]]s, who may be viewing the opera in areas lacking seatback viewing, or people with compromised eyesight.

==Venues==
In the US, the company’s systems are in use in the [[Ellie Caulkins Opera House]]

==Awards==
In 2001, the company won the [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]] Laboratories’ Technology Commercialization Award for its Simultext system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanl.gov/news/index.php/fuseaction/home.story/story_id/1170 Todd Hanson, "Los Alamos announces technology commercialization awards," ''Los Alamos National Laboratory News''], Los Alamos National Security, LLC, US Department of Energy's NNSA, May 7, 2001 on lanl.gov/news.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, the company’s software was one of four finalists for the Excellence Award for Commercial Software awarded by the New Mexico Information Technology and Software Association.

'''Gitel (Gertrude) Poznanski Steed''' (May 3, 1914 – September 6, 1977) was an American cultural [[anthropologist]] known for her research in India 1950–52 (and returning in 1970) involving [[Ethnology|ethnological]] work in three villages to study the complex detail of their social structure. She supplemented her research with thousands of ethnological photographs of the individuals and groups studied, the quality of which was recognised by [[Edward Steichen]]. She experienced chronic illnesses after her return from the field, but nevertheless completed publications and many lectures but did not survive to finish a book ''The Human Career in Village India'' which was to integrate and unify her many-sided studies of human character formation in the cultural/historical context of India.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lesser, Alexander 1979 Obituary of Gitel Steed. American Anthropologist 81:88‐91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berleant-Schiller, Riva 1988 Gitel (Gertrude) Poznanski Steed. IN Women Anthropologists: A Biographical Dictionary. Edited by Ute Gacs, Aisha Khan, Jerrie McIntyre, Ruth Weinberg. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. Pp. 331–336. Gitel (Gertrude) Poznanski Steed&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Gertrude Poznanski was born on May 3, 1914, in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, the home of her mother, Sarah Auerbach. She was the youngest of sisters Mary and Helen, who both later emigrated to Israel. Her father was Jakob Poznanski, a businessman and Polish native who had come to the United States from Belgium. When Poznanski was still a baby, the family moved to [[The Bronx]], New York, where she was schooled at [[Wadleigh High School for Girls|Wadleigh High]]. Though not religious, she adopted the [[Yiddish]] name of Gitel. Her mother was active in the [[Women's suffrage|women's suffrage movement]] and in leftist politics.

Dr. Steed began a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in banking and finance at [[New York University]], but embraced the [[Greenwich Village]] artistic and political life, often singing blues in nightclubs, and dropped out to take a job as a writer with the [[Works Progress Administration]]. [[Raphael Soyer|Rafael Soyer]] painted portrait of her at eighteen, ''Girl in a White Blouse'', (1932) which is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, and she is the medusa-haired subject in Soyer's ''Two Girls'' 1933 (oil on canvas) at the Smart Museum. In 1933 she met the painter Robert Steed (b.1903), whom she married in 1947.

== Introduction to anthropology ==
Philosopher [[Sidney Hook]] persuaded Steed to return to NYU and in 1938 she completed her B.A. with honors in sociology and [[anthropology]], then studied as a graduate at [[Columbia University]] until 1940 as a Research Fellow in the Department of Anthropology under Professor [[Ruth Benedict]] whom she had met in 1937 and who in 1939 led Gitel Steed's first field experience among the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot Indians]] of [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, A. B. (1996). Transcribing Insima, a Blackfoot "Old Lady". Reading beyond words: Native history in context, 381–402.&lt;/ref&gt;  Benedict's ''Patterns of Culture''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Benedict, Ruth | title=Patterns of culture | publication-date=1934 | publisher=The New American Library | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/6015727 | accessdate=May 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1934 and had become standard reading for anthropology courses in American universities for years, and Steed was influenced by Benedict's position in that book that, "A culture, like an individual, is a more or less consistent pattern of thought and action", and that each culture chooses from "the great arc of human potentialities" only a few characteristics which become the leading personality traits of the persons living in that culture. From 1939 to 1941, Steed undertook research for [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]], the explorer and writer on Inuit life then planning a two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', on diet and subsistence; Steed worked on the South American Ona, [[Yaghan people|Yahgan]], and the [[Antillean]] Arawak and Carib, and from this formative experience began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer subsistence (not finished until 1969, well after she had established her career).&lt;ref&gt;Price, D. H. (2008). Anthropological intelligence: the deployment and neglect of American anthropology in the Second World War. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, after the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[The Holocaust|holocaust]] against the Jews was exposed, Gitel Steed set aside her anthropology and joined the Jewish Black Book Committee, an organization of the [[World Jewish Congress]] and other Jewish anti-Fascist groups. With a few peers, she participated during 1944 and 1945 in writing ''The Black Book: The Nazi Crime Against the Jewish People'', an exhaustive indictment of calculated Nazi anti-Jewish war crimes intended for submission to the [[United Nations War Crimes Commission]]. Steed wrote "The Strategy of Decimation"  published in 1946 for the Jewish Black Book Committee.

Steed taught at [[Hunter College]] in New York 1945 and 1947. While teaching at [[Fisk University]] in 1946/1947 she researched the [[Negro]] in the United States and in Africa and was managing editor of the University's and the American Council on Race Relations' monthly summary of "Race Relations" in America.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, D. (1978). More on the Nonacademic Scene. Anthropology News, 19(3), 22–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, L. (1997). Gender and the Deconstruction nf the Race Concept. American Anthropologist, 99(3), 545–588.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947–1949 she joined Dr. [[Ruth Bunzel]] in establishing the China group of Columbia's Research in Contemporary Cultures to study immigrant Chinese culture, primarily in New York City, from 1947 into 1949, working with migrants from the same community from China's [[Guangdong|Kwantung]] Provincal village, [[Taishan, Guangdong|Toi Shan]]. She undertook life histories, community self-analysis, and projective tests, then proposed an extended field project in the Toi Shan community to understand the interdependency in social and economic relations between migrants and their kinsmen at home. [[Margaret Mead]] and others joined these Columbia [[Cross-cultural studies|comparative studies]] of contemporary cultures and they were incorporated into Mead's "The Study of Cultures at a Distance,"&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Mead and Rhoda Metraux, and published in 1953 by the University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Steed planned "The Effects of Village Institutions on Personality in South China" and had funds granted for its continuation of her Chinese research in China.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; However the occurrence of the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]] of 1948 scuttled the project.

== India ==
Steadfastly committed to field study of institutional determinants of individual and social character, she took up the suggestion of [[psychiatrist]], Abram Kardiner, then associated with Columbia University's Department of Sociology, to pursue a similar study in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Mandelbaum, David Goodman, 1911–1987 | author2=Hockings, Paul | title=Dimensions of social life: essays in honor of David G.

The hundreds of essays he received enabled him to theorise about how the Nazis managed to gain and retain power. See his "Why Hitler Came Power", Prentice-Hall, 1938; "Systematic Sociology in Germany", Octagon, 1966; "The Nazi Movement, Atherton", 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Funding was received through a grant from the Department of the Navy.&lt;ref name="lib.uchicago.edu"&gt;University of Chicago Library (2009) Guide to the Gitel P. Steed Papers 1907–1980 [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/scrc/findingaids/view.php?eadid=ICU.SPCL.GSTEED]&lt;/ref&gt; She assembled a research team of Dr. James Silverberg, [[Morris Carstairs|Dr. Morris Carstairs]] of [[Edinburgh University]], and her husband Robert Steed, leaving for Indian 1949, where there was added a small staff of Indian workers. They included Bhagvati Masher and Kantilal Mehta, who worked as interpreters; Nandlal Dosajh, a psychologist;&lt;ref&gt;"The real beginning of Projective Psychology in india may be credited to the author with his first exposure with Rorschach test under the guidance of Dr. James Silverberg (1955) who had administered Rorschach Test to the author [Nandlal Dosajh] in 1949 and on the basis of author's performance on this test, he was selected to work with the Columbia University Team under Dr. Gitel P. Steed on the project 'An Approach to a Study of Personality Formation in a Hindu Village in Gujarat' (1955)." Projective Psychology in India Dosajh, N L, PhD. SIS ''Journal of Projective Psychology &amp; Mental Health'' 5.2 (Jul 1998): 83–86.&lt;/ref&gt; N. Prabhudas, an economist who conducted the land utilization survey; and Jerome D'Souza as cook. In the second year of research, the team also included an Indian assistant, Tahera, as well as Americans Grace Langley and John Koos.&lt;ref name="lib.uchicago.edu"/&gt; Her preparations were aided by her friendship with Gautam Sarabhai, a Gujarati Indian she had met in New York who assisted her in learning [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].  She also trained in the use of a professional camera.

The research goals and procedures were ambitious; to [[Empirical research|empirically]] bring together interactions of individual, culture, community and institutions, relating real individuals, not merely statistical patterns, for functional-historical analysis of character formation at the village level&lt;ref&gt;Donham, B., &amp; Roethlisberger, J. People and Projects.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eames, E.. (1966). Hindu Cousin Marriages. American Anthropologist, 68(3), 757–758.&lt;/ref&gt; in the three settlements chosen: [[Bakrana]], a [[Hindu]] village in [[Gujarat]]; Sujarupa, a Hindu hamlet in [[Rajputana]]; and Adhon, a predominantly [[Muslim]] village in the [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]]. Bakrana was a farming economy in fertile flatlands, exclusively Hindu and with an active [[Caste|caste system]], largely untouched by the former [[British Raj|British rule]] or by land reform changes current then in India. Sujarupa hamlet was a single-caste community in the upland valleys. Adhon was controlled by pro-independence Muslims, with more occupational castes and subgroups than Bakrana, with religious minorities.

== Consolidation of ethnographic research in India ==
Steed returned to the United States in December 1951 with more than 30,000 pages of handwritten notes and some thousands of ethnological photographs, but infected with [[malaria]], and shortly after her return she also developed [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] which was particularly difficult to control and frequently put her in hospital. In addition, she suffered for over thirty years from [[Pituitary gland|pituitary cancer]]. Illness impaired her later career so that she was unable to receive her [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] until 1969, 8 years before her death. In 1963, however, Conrad Arensberg wrote "her reputation and accomplishments are such as to make her lack of a PhD of little moment for her standing in the profession".&lt;ref&gt;Arensberg, Conrad 1963 Unpublished letter on file in the Department of Anthropology and Sociology, Hofstra University, Hempstead, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; Her reputation also rests on her unpublished notes; the thousands of pages of interviews, observations, projective test results, life histories, and villagers' paintings, most of which are now in the special collections of the University of Chicago Libraries.

During the eleven years after returning from India and taking up a position at Hofstra College (now [[Hofstra University]]) in 1962 where she continued to her death in 1977, Steed had no university affiliation and promoted her work through seminars and lectures at [[Columbia University]], [[University of Chicago]], and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1953, Steed participated in a Social Science Research Council Conference on Economic Development in Brazil, India, and Japan, analyzing [[Morris Edward Opler|Dr. Morris Opler's]] "Cultural Aspects of Economic Development in Rural India", then later that year, 1953/4, she analyzed "The Individual, Family, and Community in Village India" in Columbia University's Department of Sociology graduate seminar on the psychodynamics of culture, chaired by [[Abram Kardiner]]. In 1954 Steed lectured on "The Child, Family and Community in Rural Gujarat" for the University of Chicago ''Seminar on Village India''. The lectures and discussions are recorded in the archive. She presented in India symposia at meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]], and the [[Social Science Research Council]].

Her one publication of note during this period was a chapter "Notes on an Approach to a Study of Personality Formation in a Hindu Village in Gujarat",&lt;ref&gt;Von Fürer-Haimendorf, C.. (1957). [Review of Village India: Studies in the Little Community]. ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', University of London, 19(2), 394–395.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating cultural and institutional influences on the personality of a single [[Rajput]] landowner,&lt;ref&gt;"
Gitel P. Steed shifts the focus almost com- pletely and illustrates the effects of changes in the traditional view on the personality formation of a single Hindu landlorD" Smith, M. W.. (1956). [Review of Village India: Studies in the Little Community]. ''The British Journal of Sociology'', 7(3), 263–264.&lt;/ref&gt; for a volume ''Village India: studies in the little community''&lt;ref&gt;Beals, Alan R &amp; Marriott, McKim (1955). Village India: studies in the little community: papers. University of Chicago Press, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Alan Beals and Dr. McKim Marriott, published in 1955;&lt;ref&gt;Opler, M. E..

''The Far Eastern Quarterly'', 15(1), 146–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Steed's chapter has been held up as a model for the treatment of personality problems and culture in India.&lt;ref&gt;Cappannari, S. C.. (1957). [Review of Village India: Studies in the Little Community]. ''American Anthropologist'', 59(3), 558–559.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and the presentations she made at conferences assisted her in delimiting her doctoral thesis ''Caste and Kinship in Rural Gujarat: The Social Use of Space''.

During these eleven years she gave birth to her son, Andrew Hart (b. 1953), and taught English at the [[Jefferson Schools|Jefferson School]], a Manhattan private school favored by the political left. Gitel and husband Robert Steed opened the doors of their house on West 23rd Street to visitors who included Ruth Bunzel, [[Sula Benet]], [[Vera Rubin]], [[Stanley Diamond]], [[Alexander Lesser]], [[Margaret Mead]], and Conrad Arensberg.

In 1970 Steed revisited [[Bakrana]], its population then doubled since her last visit, to observe the impact of the transforming politics in India.

== Photographer ==
[[Edward Steichen]], Director of the Department of Photography of the Museum of Modern Art, said Steed's photographs of Indian villagers, which though taken for the anthropological record and used as illustrations in varied lectures and presentations, ranked "with first-rate human interpretations by professional photographers."&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Modern Art press release of February 19, 1953, for ''Always the Young Strangers''[https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/1683/releases/MOMA_1953_0013_13.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Steichen mounted ''Always the Young Strangers'' exhibition at [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] in honour of [[Carl Sandburg|Carl Sandberg's]] 75th birthday and included Gitel Steed's photos, six of which are in the Museum's permanent photographic collection. Steichen again used her pictures in the Museum's world-touring blockbuster, [[The Family of Man]] exhibition and book. Her photographs were republished in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]], and featured in the [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch|St. Louis Post Despatch]]. While at Hofstra University, her photographic work was exhibited as part of the University's "Focus on India" presentation in 1962, and in 1963 Hofstra showed Steed photographs of Hindu and Muslim villagers. That same year Steed held the exhibition ''Child Life in Village India'' at the New Canaan Art Association Gallery in Connecticut and another, ''Cradle to Grave in Village India'' at the Hudson Guild Gallery in New York. In 1967 Vincent Fresno's ''Human Actions in Four Societies'' used a selection as illustrations.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
Dr. Gitel Steed died in the night of September 6, 1977, evidently from a heart attack, at the age of sixty-three. She was survived by her husband and supporter for thirty years, artist Robert Steed, and by her son, Andrew.

The Gitel P. Steed papers 1907–1980 are archived in the University of Chicago Library and extend to approximately 13 linear metres (43 feet) of material. Most is data from her Columbia University Research in Contemporary India Field Project of 1949–1951 collected from three villages in western and northern India; extensive life histories of informants, psychological tests, typed notes, field notebooks, photographs, genealogies, histories, transcripts of interviews, and art work, mostly watercolours, by both researchers and child and adult villagers. These are joined by records of lectures and other publications relating to the India Project by Steed and by other scholars. Also held is data from Steed's previous fieldwork project among Chinese immigrants in New York City. The collection was given to the University of Chicago Committee on Southern Asian Studies by Robert Steed in 1978 and conveyed to the University of Chicago Library in 1984. Prior to their arrival, James Silverberg and McKim Marriott put the papers a preliminary order reflected in the collection's current organization. The collection was augmented by Robert Steed in 1985 and 1989, and by McKim Marriott and James Silverberg in 1994. [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/southasia/steed.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5903">The '''Global Career Development Facilitator (GCDF)''' [[certification]] is an evolution of the Career Development Facilitator (CDF) certification developed in response to a RFP from the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee (NOICC) during 1992. The winning proposal went to Oakland University in Michigan where the initial development began under the leadership of Howard Splete.  
In 2000, when NOICC was eliminated and the employees were split between the USDOL and USDED, the curriculum program was awarded to the National Career Development Association (NCDA) to promote and train practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/pubs/TeachersGuide/noicc.html |title=Archived: The Teacher's Guide to the Dept. of Ed, 2000: National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee (NOICC) |publisher=.ed.gov |date= |access-date=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Working Ahead curriculum was the second generation, developed at Heldrich Center for Workforce Development, with a linkage the  USDOL resources—different from the first generation with greater emphasis towards USDOE resources. Since then, numerous programs have been developed. The National Employment Counseling Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://employmentcounseling.org|title=Home - National Employment Counseling Association|author=|date=|work=EmploymentCounseling.org|access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in partnership with Life Strategies,  following the Heldrich Center model, developed the first completely online version, the third generation, with full instructor support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.employmentcounseling.org/About-NECA.aspx |title =about NECA | publisher=employmentcounseling.org | date=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates from approved programs apply for GCDF certification from the Center for Credentialing in Education (CCE), an affiliate of the [[National Board for Certified Counselors]] (Center for Credentialing in Education, 1997). The credential recognizes the education and experience of those working in CDF occupations like [[careers advisory service]]s and employment services. GCDF have successfully completed an approved CDF training program (over 120 hours and maintain continuing education credits or lose certification) and have met and verified specific educational and experience requirements.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cce-global.org/GCDF |title=Global Career Development Facilitator |publisher=Cce-global.org |date= |access-date=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outline ==
GCDF training is built around 12 core competencies identified by career counseling experts. A period of supervised career facilitation practice also is required prior to certification. The 12 competency areas addressed in GCDF training are Helping Skills, Labor Market Information and Resources, [[Educational assessment|Assessment]], [[multiculturalism|Diverse Populations]], Ethical and Legal Issues, Career Development Models, [[Employability|Employability Skills]], Training Clients and Peers, Program Management and Implementation, Promotion and Public Relations, Technology, and Supervision (Brawley, 2002; National Career Development Association, 2007; Splete &amp; Hoppin, 2000). In light of cultural concerns with the development of the GCDF outside the United States, the tasks within each of the competency areas are adapted to meet the needs of a particular country's context.

In the United States, GCDFs are sometimes still recognized as CDFs and work in government agencies and employment offices, in private practice as "coaches," and in colleges and universities (Splete &amp; Hoppin, 2000). One of the more auspicious places GCDFs are found in the United States is Career One Stop Centers, which are sponsored by the U.S. [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]]. The GCDFs at centers like these work with people who are making career transitions. Also, in 2006, the state of South Carolina passed legislation requiring all middle and secondary schools to have a career facilitation and guidance services available to students.

The GCDF certification program for career guidance providers has been implemented in Bulgaria, Canada, China, Cyprus, Egypt, Germany, Greece, Japan, Macedonia, New Zealand, Portugal, Romania, South Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey. In 2011, training programs have started in El Salvador. Worldwide, about 17,600 GCDF have been certified until 2011.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''Global Reports on Adult Learning and Education''' ('''GRALE''') are a series of reports that monitor progress on [[Adult education|Adult Learning and Education]] (ALE), promote action, identify trends in the field of ALE, and explore solutions to challenges. GRALE play a key role in meeting [[UNESCO|UNESCO's]] commitment to monitor and report on countries' implementation of the Belém Framework for Action.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/news-events/events-pub/feb-2017/grale-3-global-report|title=Outcomes and implications of GRALE 3: the third global report on adult education and learning|website=www.ucl.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Framework was adopted by 144 UNESCO Member States at the Sixth International Conference on Adult Learning and Education (CONFINTEA VI), which was held in [[Belém]], Brazil, in 2009. In the Belém Framework for Action, countries agreed to improve ALE across five areas of action: policy; governance; financing; participation, inclusion and equity; and quality.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning. 2010b. Belém Framework for Action. Hamburg. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc&lt;/nowiki&gt;. unesco.org/images/0018/001877/187789m.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002459/245913e.pdf|title=3rd global report on adult learning and education: the impact of adult learning and education on health and well-being, employment and the labour market, and social, civic and community life|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-820-1213-0|location=|pages=19, 23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54875#.WXCbooiGPb1|title=UN News - UNESCO study informs policymakers on benefits of adult learning and education|last=Section|first=United Nations News Service|date=2016-09-08|website=UN News Service Section|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Since it was founded in 1945, UNESCO has been supporting global dialogue and action in the field of Adult Learning and Education. In 1949, it organized the first CONFINTEA. Since then, five further CONFINTEA Conferences have taken place at intervals of roughly twelve years, providing UNESCO Member States with valuable opportunities to consider, compare and develop their approaches to ALE. The GRALE series lies at the heart of global monitoring of ALE. Each report gathers the latest data and evidence on ALE, highlights good policies and practices, and reminds governments of their ALE-related commitments.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/epale/en/blog/reflections-unescos-3rd-global-report-adult-learning-and-education|title=Reflections on UNESCO's 3rd Global Report on Adult Learning and Education  - EPALE - European Commission|website=EPALE|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the process of gathering data for GRALE, UNESCO invites countries to submit detailed national reports on ALE.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Thus GRALE encourages countries to undertake a self-assessment exercise and to consider their progress in each of the five action areas identified in the Belém Framework for Action. Following the publication of each GRALE, its findings are presented at a wide range of events and discussed with a broad range of partners. GRALE therefore engages countries in dialogue and encourages them to learn from each other on how to improve ALE policies and practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walters 228–237"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=Shirley|last2=Watters|first2=Kathy|date=2017-08-01|title=Reflecting on the Global Report on Adult Learning and Education in the "Post-Truth Society"|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0741713617700675|journal=Adult Education Quarterly|language=en|volume=67|issue=3|pages=228–237|doi=10.1177/0741713617700675|issn=0741-7136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walters 228–237"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Reports ==
GRALE I&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning. 2010a. Global Report on Adult Learning and Education. Hamburg. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0018/001864/186431e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was designed to inform discussions at CONFINTEA VI in 2009. In order to prepare GRALE I, countries were invited to submit national reports, which were largely in narrative form. Based on these reports, GRALE I provided a general overview of trends and identified key challenges in ALE. The report found that while many countries had implemented adult education policies, governments were not allocating sufficient funds for the sector to deliver its full potential.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

GRALE II&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning. 2013. Second Global Report on Adult Learning and Education: Rethinking Literacy. Hamburg. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco&lt;/nowiki&gt;. org/images/0022/002224/222407E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; presented the first opportunity to take stock of the implementation of the Belém Framework for Action. Member States were invited to complete a monitoring survey that was more structured than the narrative reports that had been submitted for GRALE I. GRALE II also focused on a specific theme: youth and adult literacy, which the Belém Framework for Action identifies as the foundation of lifelong learning. GRALE II helped clarify concepts of literacy, providing guidance and inspiration for the later drafting of the Recommendation on Adult Learning and Education (2015).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cradall.org/content/grale-iii-third-global-report-adult-learning-and-education-executive-summary-and-report|title=GRALE III - The third Global Report on Adult Learning and Education Executive Summary and Report {{!}} CRADALL {{!}} Centre for Research &amp; Development in Adult and Lifelong Learning (CR&amp;DALL) at the University of Glasgow|website=cradall.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GRALE III reflects the move towards a more holistic view of education and lifelong learning embedded in the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. This holistic view is the rationale behind the chapters on health and well-being, employment and the labour market, and social, civic and community life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eaea.org/en/home/news/work-on-the-grale-iii-has-begun.html|title=News|website=www.eaea.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of GRALE IV is currently in process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Leland Powers School''', also known as the '''Leland Powers School of Communication''', '''Leland Powers School of Radio, Theatre, and Television''', '''Leland Powers Theatre School''', the '''Leland Powers School of Expression''', '''Leland Powers School of the Spoken Word''', and originally called the '''Leland Powers School of Elocution''', was originally located in the [[Fenway–Kenmore|Fenway neighborhood]] of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and later in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. Speaker and author [[Leland Powers]] founded the school in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Hesperides. (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DlW4BN70woYC&amp;dq A Handbook of American Private Schools]''. Read Books. p 236. {{ISBN|978-1406766318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school educated several notable speakers and authors of the early 20th century, including drama educator [[T. Earl Pardoe]], actress [[Reta Shaw]], and journalist [[Wendall Woodbury]].&lt;ref name=Tibbetts&gt;Tibbetts, M.M. (1954) ''Random recollections: Commemorating the 50th anniversary of Leland Powers School, 1904-1954''. Boston: Leland Powers School.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Leland T. Powers]] founded the school after teaching with the [[Redpath Lyceum Bureau]], a [[Chautauqua]] circuit business. While working for the bureau, Powers was assigned as a reader during chautauquas, and as a coach to other readers. Powers also edited scripts for usage, focusing on readability and performance. During this time Powers was an associate of [[Carl Sandburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Tapia, J.E. (1997) ''Circuit chautauqua: From rural education to popular entertainment in early twentieth century America.'' McFarland. p 66. {{ISBN|978-0786402137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Powers' school cost $200 for a semester's tuition.&lt;ref name=Tibbetts/&gt; Joining his wife and more than a dozen staff members in teaching 140 students annually, Powers had a building constructed in 1914 at 31 Evans Way in the [[Fenway–Kenmore|Fenway neighborhood]] next door to the [[Girls' Latin School]].

The School was credited with being on the leading edge of technology when in 1944 it started broadcasting a show called "The Great American Home" on local station [[WIXG]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuttle, Marguerite. (1952) ''A Guide to education for professional careers.'' p 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mathematical Olympiad Program''' (abbreviated '''MOP''', formerly called the '''Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program''', abbreviated '''MOSP''') is an intensive summer program held at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. The main purpose of MOP, held since 1974, is to select and train the six members of the [[United States of America|U.S.]] team for the [[International Mathematical Olympiad|International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)]]. Students qualify for the program by taking the [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad|United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO)]]. The top twelve American scorers from all grades form the "black" group. The approximately eighteen next highest American scorers among students from 11th grade and under form the "blue" group. In 2004, the program was expanded to include approximately thirty of the highest-scoring American freshmen and sophomores each year, the "red" group; this was later split into two, forming the "green" group, which consists of approximately fifteen of the highest-scoring freshmen and sophomores who have qualified through the USAMO, and the "red" group, which consists of those who have qualified through the USAJMO. The colorful designations of these groups were adapted from [[Karate]].  In 2013, the red and green groups were unified.  Also, with the new system the Black Group includes more or less only the IMO team, which is not necessarily all USAMO winners.

Until 2011, only Black MOPpers were eligible for the selection to the USA IMO team, determined by combining USAMO results with results of a similar exam called the Team Selection Test (TST). From 2011, a new test called the Team Selection Test Selection Test (TSTST) was established; this test is open for any of the participants of MOP, and along with results from the USAMO, determines the students who take the TSTs.  This ultimately, along with the USAMO and MOP tests, determines the IMO team.

Canadians are allowed to write the [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad|USAMO]] but not to participate in MOP unless they are US residents.  Occasionally, when Canadians are amongst the USAMO winners, top scoring honorable mentions are added to the black group.  These additional students are also eligible for the IMO team.  In 2005, such a student did qualify for the team and went on to win a gold medal at the IMO.  Under the TSTST system, effective 2011, honorable mentions can qualify for the IMO team and will be placed in the black group if they do so. 

==Cutoff scores==
Note that Red cutoffs 2010 onward refer to USAJMO while 2009 before refer to USAMO.

However, it should be noted that the cutoff scores for groups are not entirely rigid; some students are moved between groups at the beginning of the program. However, they do dictate who is invited to the program. As part of the process of selecting members of the European Girls Math Olmypiad, many years the Math Olympiad program has additionally invited female students to the camp. In 2017, the cutoff was 13 for the USAMO and 20 for the USAJMO. In 2018, the cutoff was 8 for USAMO and 11 for USAJMO.

== Locations ==
The first few MOPs were held at [[Rutgers University]]. After that, and until 1995, the program was alternately hosted by the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] in even-numbered years and by the United States Military Academy at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] in odd-numbered years. The 1995 MOP was held at [[Illinois Math and Science Academy|IMSA]] in [[Aurora, Illinois]], where then-MOP director [[Titu Andreescu]] was a member of the math faculty. Most of the MOPs from 1996 on forward have been held in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] where the [[American Mathematics Competitions|AMC]] headquarters is located. An exception was made in the summer of 2001, as the United States would be hosting the IMO that year in [[Washington, D.C.]], and nearby [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] was selected as the location for MOP. Starting in 2015, MOP was held at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].

== Year-round MOP ==
For years, the idea of extending the training program for the U.S. IMO team was discussed.  During the 2004-2005 school year, U.S. IMO team coach Zuming Feng directed the Winter Olympiad Training Program, utilizing the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) site for discussion purposes.  The program was short-lived, lasting only that year.  MOP participants are now able to participate for free in Art of Problem Solving's WOOT program for year-round olympiad training.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3071">'''Monica Melanie Storrs''' (February 12, 1888 – December 14, 1967) was a British-born Canadian pioneer and Anglican [[missionary]].

She was born at [[St Peter's Church, Eaton Square|St Peter's]] Vicarage, [[Grosvenor Gardens, London|Grosvenor Gardens]], in the [[City of Westminster]], London to [[John Storrs (priest)|John Storrs]] and Lucy {{nee}} Cust. Her elder brother was [[Ronald Storrs]].

Monica, at two years of age, developed a medical condition which left her unable to walk for ten years. Not physically capable of attending school during this time, her parents educated her themselves.&lt;ref&gt;W. L. Morton, "Introduction" in ''God's Galloping Girl: The Peace River Diaries of Monica Storrs, 1929 1931'' (Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1979): xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; She was later educated at [[Francis Holland School]] and [https://archive.is/20070317111732/http://www.natsoc.org.uk/stchristophers/ St Christopher's College], [[Blackheath, London]].

After her parents died, Storrs, although educated for a patrician English life, arrived in [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St John]], [[British Columbia]] in October 1929 as the Great Depression began. She was the first missionary to teach Sunday school and take regular Christian services. The group of women, the Companions of the Peace, were funded by the [http://www.mapleleaf.org.uk/ Fellowship of the Maple Leaf] (which still promotes links between churches in Canada and the United Kingdom.)
 
Although intending to work for one year, she stayed as missionary for more than 21 years in [[Peace River Country]], British Columbia. She was nicknamed 'God's Galloping Girl' for her marathon rides in all weathers and over rough terrain, to visit remote farm families and promote their welfare. "...we had another mile across stubble fields and between hundreds of ghostly stooks. Once I charged straight upon a barbed wire fence, and was nearly impaled..."&lt;ref&gt;''God’s Galloping Girl'': 154.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Storrs and the other workers were all women, and sometimes regarded as feminist pioneers. Their pioneer chapel is preserved at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070604152355/http://www.explorenorth.com/library/communities/canada/bl-ftstjohnmuseum.htm Fort St John - North Peace Museum], where it has been restored.

She left Peace Country in 1950 to return to England, where she lived at Peacewood, [[Farther Common]], [[Liss]], [[Hampshire]]. She continued her work until 1967, when she suffered a stroke and died.&lt;ref&gt;Monica Storrs. ''Companions of the Peace: Diaries and Letters of Monica Storrs, 1931 – 1939.'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 1999):200-202&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4864">'''Peer-led team learning''' ('''PLTL''') is a model of teaching undergraduate science, math, and engineering courses that introduces peer-led workshops as an integral part of a course.&lt;ref name=Gosser1&gt;Gosser,D.K. and Roth, V. (1998) The Workshop Chemistry Project: Peer-led Team Learning, Journal of Chemical Education, 75, 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gosser2&gt;Gosser,D.K., Cracolice,M., Kampmeier, J.A., Roth,V., Strozak, V.S., Varma-Nelson,P. (2001) Peer-led Team Learning: A Guidebook. Upper Saddle River, NJ. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Students who have done well in a course (for instance, General Chemistry) are recruited to become ''peer-leaders''. The peer-leaders meet with small groups of six to ten students each week, for one to two hours, to discuss, debate, and engage in problem solving related to the course material.

== History ==

PLTL originated at the [[City College of New York]] in the early 1990s as part of an effort to address the low success rate of students in General Chemistry.&lt;ref name =woodward&gt;Woodward,A., Gosser,D.K., and Weiner, M. Problem Solving Workshops in General Chemistry. Journal of Chemical Education, 70, 651.&lt;/ref&gt;  Peer-led Workshops were incorporated into the teaching of General Chemistry by reducing the amount of lecture to three hours from four hours. Preliminary results at City College of New York and other collaborating institutions indicated improved student attitudes and performance in General Chemistry and other courses. 

These early results led to further study and development of PLTL by a national team, which produced a Guidebook for PLTL.&lt;ref name=Gosser2 /&gt; An extensive national dissemination effort resulted in more widespread adoption of essential components of PLTL in a variety of science, mathematics, and engineering coursework.&lt;ref name=gafney&gt;Gafney, L. and Varma-Nelson,P. Peer-Led Team Learning: Evaluation, Dissemination, and Institutionalization of a College Level Initiative Springer Science: Dordrecht, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review of research on PLTL and closely related peer-led learning formats found that published studies representing courses at over twenty institutions have demonstrated an average increase of 15% ABC as a fraction of the initially enrolled students, compared to traditional lecture. See for instance key studies in Chemistry,&lt;ref name =lewis&gt;Lewis,S. and Lewis,J.E., Departing from Lectures: A Peer-led Guided Inquiry Alternative. J. Chem. Educ.  2005, 82: 135-139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hockings&gt;Hockings,S.C., DeAngelis,K.J. and Frey,R.F. Peer-led Team Learning in General Chemistry: Implementation and Evaluation. J. Chem. Educ. 2008, 85:  990-996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =wamser&gt;Wamser,C.C. Peer-led Team Learning in Organic Chemistry: Effects on Student Performance, Success, and Persistence in the Course. J. Chem. Educ. 2006, 83: 1562-1566.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = lyon&gt;Lyon,D.C. and Lagowski,J.J. Effectiveness of Small-Group Learning in a Large Lecture Class. J. Chem. Educ. 2008, 85: 1571-1576.&lt;/ref&gt; Biology,&lt;ref name=pres&gt;Preszler, R.W., Replacing Lecture with Peer-led Workshops Improves Student Learning. CBE-Life Sciences Education. 2009, 8: 182-192.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer Science,&lt;ref name =horw&gt;Horwitz,S. and Rodger,S.H.

== Theory ==
PLTL can be understood in the context of [[cognitive science]]. It is consistent with [[social constructivism]] and ideas of [[Vygotsky]] in that students are asked to construct their own understanding with guidance from a more capable peer. They can be said to be learning within the zone of proximal development.

Evaluation of successful implementations of suggest&lt;ref name=Gosser2 /&gt;  that PLTL has six critical components: 

# PLTL is integral to the course.
# Peer-leaders are trained in leadership skills.
# Faculty are involved.
# Materials for workshops are challenging and promote collaborative effort.
# Space and noise level acceptable for group discussion and work.
# PLTL is integrated into the institutional structure.

[[Image:Daniela-Ambrosoli-2010.jpg|thumb|Daniela Ambrosoli]]

The '''Pierino Ambrosoli Foundation''' is dedicated to [[Daniela Ambrosoli]]’s father, Pierino Ambrosoli, a successful Italian/Swiss industrialist and her mother, [[:de:Bragowa|Sonja Bragowa]], a former dancer in the 1920s.

The foundation is not due to the testamentary will of Pierino Ambrosoli. Rather, it arose by the desire of Daniela Ambrosoli, who decided to use a substantial portion of her inherited fortune from the father, to support young artists on their way to the stage. Thus, the Pierino Ambrosoli Foundation was founded on May 10, 1990 in Zurich.&lt;ref name="Owens-Foglia1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cristina Owens-Foglia|title=Kulturstiftung Pierino Ambrosoli|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/kulturstiftung-pierino-ambrosoli/oclc/34049314&amp;referer=brief_results|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Pierino Ambrosoli Foundation supports very young talented dancers and musicians on their way to the stage for the promotion of dance and music at a professional level through scholarships all over the world at recognized vocational institutions. Ballet school graduates can obtain a scholarship as a trainee at theatres and dance companies. The foundation collaborates with other organizations, schools and theatres. A careful investigation of the talent and the need for a scholarship is a prerequisite for the scholarship grants.&lt;ref name= Thurner&gt;{{cite journal |author = Christina Thurner | year = 2000 | title = Fort the love of art | url = http://ambrosoli.org/eng1/Presse/Thurner-2000.pdf | journal = tanz-la danse suisse (Zurich)| issue = May 2000 | accessdate = 2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CODARTS&gt;{{cite journal | author = CODARTS | year = 2006 | title = Pierino Ambrosoli Foundation | url = http://www.codarts.nl/NL/media/content/magazine/ | journal = CODARTS Magazine | issue = January 2006 | pages = 9 | accessdate = 2014-05-10 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140730/http://www.codarts.nl/NL/media/content/magazine/ | archivedate = 2014-02-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= DANZAsi&gt;{{cite journal |author = Michele Mastroianni | year = 2013 | title = Daniela Ambrosoli | url = http://ambrosoli.org/eng1/Presse/Danzasi-April2013.pdf | journal = DANZAsi (Roma)| issue = April 2013 | accessdate = 2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On request, the foundation offers also technical information and advice. The personal care and regular contact with the foundation’s scholarship holders distinguishes the foundation's work. The Pierino Ambrosoli Foundation is member of the International Organization for the Transition of Professional Dancers (IOTPD). [[Daniela Ambrosoli]] has been among others member of the patronage committee of the [[Prix de Lausanne]], the Swiss Dance Prize and she is a member of the board Montecinemaverità Foundation.

==Organisation==

==Writing==
Marshall began writing the ''Principles of Economics'' in 1881 and he spent much of the next decade at work on the treatise. His plan for the work gradually extended to a two-volume compilation on the whole of economic thought; the first volume was published in 1890 to worldwide acclaim that established him as one of the leading economists of his time. The second volume, which was to address foreign trade, money, trade fluctuations, taxation, and collectivism, was never published at all. Over the next two decades he worked to complete his second volume of the Principles, but his unyielding attention to detail and ambition for completeness prevented him from mastering the work's breadth.

*[http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP53.html#Bk.VI,Ch.XI XI General View of Distribution.] Marshall summarises how wealth is distributed through society.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The efficiency as compared with the cost of almost every [[Working class|class]] of [[Workforce|labour]], is thus continually being weighed in the balance in one or more branches of production against some other classes of labour: and each of these in its turn against others. This [[competition]] is primarily "vertical": it is a struggle for the field of [[employment]] between groups of labour belonging to different grades, but engaged in the same branch of production, and inclosed, as it were, between the same vertical walls. But meanwhile "horizontal" competition is always at work, and by simpler methods: for, firstly, there is great freedom of movement of adults from one business to another within each trade; and secondly, parents can generally introduce their children into almost any other trade of the same grade with their own in their neighbourhood. By means of this combined vertical and horizontal competition there is an effective and closely adjusted balance of payments to services as between labour in different grades; in spite of the fact that the labour in any one grade is mostly recruited even now from the children of those in the same grade.

The working of the principle of substitution is thus chiefly indirect. When two tanks containing fluid are joined by a pipe, the fluid, which is near the pipe in the tank with the higher level, will flow into the other, even though it be rather viscous; and thus the general levels of the tanks will tend to be brought together, though no fluid may flow from the further end of the one to the further end of the other; and if several tanks are connected by pipes, the fluid in all will tend to the same level, though some tanks have no direct connection with others. And similarly the principle of substitution is constantly tending by indirect routes to apportion earnings to efficiency between trades, and even between grades, which are not directly in contact with one another, and which appear at first sight to have no way of competing with one another." - VI.XI.6-7&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*[http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP54.html#Bk.VI,Ch.XII XII General Influences of Economic Progress.] Marshall discusses the causes of economic development.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"But after all the chief cause of the modern prosperity of new countries lies in the markets that the old world offers, not for goods delivered on the spot, but for promises to deliver goods at a distant date." - VI.XII.3&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The key-notes of the modern movement are the reduction of a great number of tasks to one pattern; the diminution of friction of every kind which might hinder powerful agencies from combining their action and spreading their influence over vast areas; and the development of transport by new methods and new forces. The macadamized roads and the improved shipping of the eighteenth century broke up local combinations and monopolies, and offered facilities for the growth of others extending over a wider area: and in our own age the same double tendency is resulting from every new extension and cheapening of communication by land and sea, by printing-press and telegraph and telephone." - VI.XII.10&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Contribution==
Marshall's influence on modifying economic thought is difficult to deny. He popularized the use of [[supply and demand]] functions as tools of price determination (previously discovered independently by [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]]); modern economists owe the linkage between price shifts and curve shifts to Marshall. Marshall was an important part of the "[[marginalist]] revolution;" the idea that consumers attempt to adjust consumption until [[marginal utility]] equals the price was another of his contributions. The [[price elasticity of demand]] was presented by Marshall as an extension of these ideas. Economic welfare, divided into [[producer surplus]] and [[consumer surplus]], was contributed by Marshall, and indeed, the two are sometimes described eponymously as '[[Marshallian surplus]].' He used this idea of surplus to rigorously analyze the effect of taxes and price shifts on market welfare. Marshall also identified [[quasi-rent]]s.

The '''Retirement Syndrome''' is a term coined by clinical professor of Leadership Development at [[INSEAD]], and author, [[Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries|Manfred F.R Kets de Vries]], to describe the difficulties faced by individuals in positions of authority, specifically [[Chief Executive Officer|Chief Executive Officer's]] (CEO's) as they attempt to "let go" at the end of a full career.&lt;ref&gt;Kets de Vries, M. (2003). The Retirement Syndrome:: The Psychology of Letting Go. European Management Journal, 21(6), 707-716.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://holbornassets.com/brexit-a-step-forward-or-backwards/ The Brexit – A Step Forwards or Backwards?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581485/talion&lt;/ref&gt;

The syndrome, also classified by Kets de Vries as the "CEO blues", is an insistence by individuals in positions of leadership or authority to remain in power, despite reaching a plateau in their careers. Individuals in this position may experience feelings of having accomplished all that can be accomplished, and a lack of creativity, or lack of lustre in their current position.  Effects are most strongly felt by those who reach a position of power earlier on in their lifetime as they will spend a much greater amount of time on the down slope towards retirement, as opposed to individuals who reach the "top" in their later years.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

Effects may also be credited to a realization by CEO's who have reached this plateau of the losses they may endure upon their retirement including:
* the loss of work
* the loss of health and vitality
* the loss of public exposure and public contact
* loss of influence, power, attention, and admiration
* loss of financial stability

As well as a desire to avoid difficult situations in which they may be required to confront the sacrifices they made on their way to the top -a fulfilling personal life, healthy relationships with spouse, children and friends, and time to develop outside contacts and interests.

== Psychological Effects ==

=== The Physical and Psychological Effects of Aging ===
The physical effects of aging- wrinkles, gray hair, balding, dental problems,  a need for glasses (stronger prescription), are coupled with a self-consciousness about the deterioration of the body. This can lead to a search for outlets that can act as substitutes for attractiveness. For leaders especially, maintaining power may be viewed as a substitute for the attractiveness that has been lost throughout the years. Leaders with narcissistic tendencies, are also more likely to feel the psychological effects of aging as they may experience a heightened sense of injury when the physical effects of aging become apparent.

=== The Experience of Nothingness ===
The Experience of nothingness is felt by individuals facing retirement if they feel as though their leadership is the only thing they have left, and a loss of this leadership would lead to their demise as a "somebody" to a "nobody".  Many individuals in this position often may not have anyone to turn to for emotional support, and will therefore cling to their position of power for as long as possible.

=== The Talion Principle ===
The [[lex talionis]] or talion principle, often referred to as the "[[eye for an eye]]" principle can be applied in the case of individuals facing retirement. This principle established in early Babylonian law, expresses the belief that criminals should be punished exactly as they had inflicted upon their victims. In the case of retirees, paranoia may ensue when it comes time for this shift in power, as they are consciously aware as leaders of the individuals who may attempt to retaliate or take revenge against them for leadership decisions taken during their careers that may have affected the happiness or wellbeing of one or more of these individuals.

=== The Edifice Complex ===
The Edifice Complex is a sense that with retirement comes the end of a legacy. More deeply felt when at the unconscious level, leaving a lasting legacy is equated with defeating death. In a way, difficulty in letting go of this legacy, and a desire to remain in power for as long as possible, may be seen in the broader sense as a difficulty facing mortality. When power begins to shift in the organization, a CEO may go through the stages of anger, sadness, and depression, which can lead to serious second thoughts in their decision to retire their position.  On the other hand, leaders who are committed to their organization and actively try to find a capable successor to carry on after their retirement generally experience less difficulty in letting go.

'''Richard Grandy''' is an American [[philosopher]] and [[logician]]. He formulated the [[principle of humanity]], which states that when interpreting another speaker we must assume that his or her beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dennett, "Mid-Term Examination," in The Intentional Stance, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;  Grandy is Carolyn and Fred McManis Professor of Philosophy at [[Rice University]] and has taught at the [[University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]] and [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~rgrandy/&lt;/ref&gt;

 | Many physicists would agree that, had it not been for congestion control, the evaluation of web browsers might never have occurred. In fact, few hackers worldwide would disagree with the essential unification of voice-over-IP and public/private key pair. In order to solve this riddle, we confirm that SMPs can be made stochastic, cacheable, and interposable.}}

==Prominent results==
In 2005 a paper generated by SCIgen, ''Rooter: A Methodology for the Typical Unification of Access Points and Redundancy'', was accepted as a non-reviewed paper to the 2005 [[WMSCI|World Multiconference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics]] (WMSCI) and the authors were invited to speak. The authors of SCIgen described their hoax on their website, and it soon received great publicity when picked up by [[Slashdot]].
WMSCI withdrew their invitation, but the SCIgen team went anyway, renting space in the hotel separately from the conference and delivering a series of randomly generated talks on their own "track." The organizer of these WMSCI conferences is Professor Nagib Callaos. From 2000 until 2005, the WMSCI was also sponsored by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]. The IEEE stopped granting sponsorship to Callaos from 2006 to 2008.
Submitting the paper was a deliberate attempt to embarrass WMSCI, which the authors claim accepts low-quality papers and sends unsolicited requests for submissions in bulk to academics.  As the SCIgen website states:{{quotation
 | One useful purpose for such a program is to auto-generate submissions to conferences that you suspect might have very low submission standards. A prime example, which you may recognize from spam in your inbox, is SCI/IIIS and its dozens of co-located conferences (check out the very broad conference description on the WMSCI 2005 website).

Computing writer [[Stan Kelly-Bootle]] noted in ''[[ACM Queue]]'' that many sentences in the "Rooter" paper were individually plausible, which he regarded as posing a problem for automated detection of hoax articles. He suggested that even human readers might be taken in by the effective use of jargon ("The pun on root/router is par for MIT-graduate humor, and at least one occurrence of methodology is mandatory") and attribute the paper's apparent incoherence to their own limited knowledge. His conclusion was that "a reliable gibberish filter requires a careful holistic review by several peer domain experts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stan Kelly-Bootle |authorlink=Stan Kelly-Bootle |date=July–August 2005 |title=Call that gibberish? |journal=[[ACM Queue]] |volume=3 |issue=6 |doi=10.1145/1080862.1080884 |page=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schlangemann {{anchor|Schlangemann}} ===
The name of a fictional man named "Herbert Schlangemann" was used to publish false scientific articles in international conferences that are suspected to be, at least partially, frauds. The author is named after the Swedish short film ''[[Der Schlangemann]]''.
* In 2008, after receiving a [[Spam (electronic)|series]] of Call-for-Paper [[e-mail]]s, a couple of students used the SCIgen computer program to generate a false [[academic publishing|scientific paper]] titled ''Towards the Simulation of E-Commerce'', using "Herbert Schlangemann" as the author. The article was accepted at the ''2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE 2008)'', co-sponsored by the [[IEEE]], to be held in [[Wuhan, China]], and the author was invited to be a session chair on grounds of his fictional [[Curriculum Vitae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = CSSE Conference Program | url = https://sites.google.com/site/herbertschlangemann/Home/csse2008_program.pdf?attredirects=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official review comment: "This paper presents cooperative technology and classical Communication. In conclusion, the result shows that though the much-touted amphibious algorithm for the refinement of randomized algorithms is impossible, the well-known client-server algorithm for the analysis of voice-over-IP by Kumar and Raman runs in _(n) time. The authors can clearly identify important features of visualization of DHTs and analyze them insightfully. It is recommended that the authors should develop ideas more cogently, organizes them more logically, and connects them with clear transitions." The paper was available for a short time in the [[IEEE]] Xplore Database but was then removed. The entire story is described in the official "Herbert Schlangemann" [[blog]],&lt;ref name="Schlangemann"&gt;{{cite web | title = The official Herbert Schlangemann Blog, The whole story behind the paper "Towards the Simulation of E-Commerce" | url = http://diehimmelistschoen.blogspot.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it also received attention in [[Slashdot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In 2009, the same incident happened and Herbert Schlangemann's latest fake paper ''PlusPug: A Methodology for the Improvement of Local-Area Networks'' was accepted for oral presentation at the ''2009 International Conference on e-Business and Information System Security (EBISS 2009)'', also co-sponsored by [[IEEE]], to be held again in [[Wuhan, China]].&lt;ref name="Schlangemann"/&gt;

In all cases, the published papers were withdrawn from the conferences' proceedings, and the conference organizing committee as well as the names of the keynote speakers were removed from their websites.

In this 2010 paper by Cyril Labbé from [[Joseph Fourier University|Grenoble University]] demonstrated the vulnerability of [[h-index]] calculations based on [[Google Scholar]] output by feeding it a large set of SCIgen-generated documents that were citing each other, effectively an academic [[link farm]]. Using this method the author managed to rank "Ike Antkare" ahead of [[Albert Einstein]] for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rr.liglab.fr/research_report/RR-LIG-008.pdf |title=Les rapports de recherche du LIG |publisher=Rr.liglab.fr |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Spellingg Bee'''", also known as "'''The Spellingg Bee'''", is the [[List of Psych episodes|second episode]] of the [[Psych (season 1)|first season]] of the American [[comedy-drama]] detective television series ''[[Psych]]''. It was written by series creator and co-executive producer [[Steve Franks]], and was directed by co-executive producer and director [[Mel Damski]] during November and December 2005. The episode originally aired on [[USA Network]] in the United States on July 14, 2006 with a rating of [[TV-PG]]. The installment features guest appearances by [[Kirsten Nelson]], [[Alexander Calvert]], Kyle Pejpar, and Jeremy Loheir, among others. It also features an appearance by [[sportscaster]] [[Bud Collins]].

The series follows [[Shawn Spencer]] ([[James Roday]]) and his assistant [[Burton Guster|Burton "Gus" Guster]] ([[Dulé Hill]]), who operate a fake psychic detective agency, which is actually based on Shawn's hyperobservant ability. In the episode, Shawn and Gus are watching a [[spelling bee]] on TV when the expected champion collapses suddenly. Suspecting a set-up, they investigate the bee. While there, the spellmaster (Alex Bruhanski) suspiciously falls over a railing to his death, strengthening their beliefs in foul play. With help from Shawn's father, [[Henry Spencer (Psych)|Henry Spencer]] ([[Corbin Bernsen]]) they discover poison in the spellmaster's meal, confirming their thoughts. Shawn realizes that the entire situation was created by a contestant and his father in order to cover up that they were cheating.

The installment was originally written to be the third episode of the season, but was moved up by the show's producers to introduce the character [[Juliet O'Hara]] earlier. Like most episodes of the series, it was filmed in and around the city of [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. "Spellingg Bee" received mixed-to-positive reception from television critics. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was watched by 4.71&amp;nbsp;million people during its original broadcast, making up approximately 3.35&amp;nbsp;million households. It received a 1.5&amp;nbsp;rating/5&amp;nbsp;share among viewers in the 18–49 demographic. Actor Dulé Hill was nominated for an award at the 13th NAMIC Vision Awards for his performance in the episode.

==Plot==
[[Shawn Spencer]] ([[James Roday]]) buys a newspaper and walks back into a restaurant to find his seat taken. The girl in his seat introduces herself as [[Juliet O'Hara]] ([[Maggie Lawson]]). Shawn realizes she's a cop, and immediately after he does, she and several officers arrest a man at the bar. Later, [[Gus (Psych)|Burton "Gus" Guster]] ([[Dulé Hill]]) is in the Psych office, watching the local spelling bee on TV. Shortly after Shawn enters the office, expected spelling bee champion Brandon Vu (Issey Lamb) collapses, to the shock of the audience. Shawn notices something wrong with Vu's inhaler, and realizes that Vu was intentionally harmed. They receive a phone call from interim police chief [[Karen Vick]] ([[Kirsten Nelson]]) asking them to investigate the bee. They interview Vu at the hospital, who tells them that his inhaler was not working during the competition. They begin individual interviews with the competitors, but discover no leads. While they are waiting between interviews, spellmaster Cavanaugh (Alex Bruhanski) experiences chest pain and falls over a railing to his death, in front of Shawn and Gus. The police write off his death as a heart attack; Shawn and Gus are skeptical, and break into Cavanaugh's booth to investigate.&lt;ref name="Page 1"/&gt;

Gus finds Cavanaugh's lunch, and believes that it is poisoned due to its unusual smell. Shawn takes it to his father, [[Henry Spencer (Psych)|Henry Spencer]] ([[Corbin Bernsen]]), to have it analyzed. Henry demands that in return, Shawn must build a dog house he promised to make in 1989. Shawn agrees, and leaves. While riding back to the office, he is run off the road by a mysterious van. Shawn wakes up in the hospital, and after he gets out, Gus informs him that he discovered another fake inhaler. Shawn returns to Henry's house to finish the dog house. Henry confirms that the lunch was poisoned, and Shawn returns to the bee. He disguises himself as the new spellmaster in order to enter the booth, and discovers that Cavanaugh had found out that Miklous Prochazka (Richard Zeman) was helping his son (Alexander Calvert), a contestant in the bee, to cheat by spelling out his son's words to him in [[Morse code]] using electrical impulses that were transferred to his false inhaler. After the bee has finished, Shawn has a "psychic vision" where he reveals everything to the police, who arrest Miklous and his son.&lt;ref name="Page 2"&gt;[[#Spellingg Bee|Spellingg Bee (#1_1002)]] p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was originally planned to be the third installment of the season, but was moved up by the show's producers in order to introduce the major character [[Juliet O'Hara]], played by [[Maggie Lawson]]. The scene introducing O'Hara was filmed as part of the fourth episode, "[[Woman Seeking Dead Husband: Smokers Okay, No Pets]]", but was added to the installment because of the need to bring in the character. It was also used for Lawson's audition for the show.&lt;ref name="begin 037"&gt;[[#Commentary|Franks et al.]], 0:37&amp;ndash;2:45&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle Pejpar and Jeremy Loheir were cast to play Young Shawn and Young Gus in the episode. The show's casting directors brought in the actors because older versions of young Shawn and Gus were needed for the flashback scenes in the episode. Sportscaster [[Bud Collins]] guest starred in the episode. Collins wrote all of his dialogue, and designed his own wardrobe for the installment.&lt;ref name="begin 432"&gt;[[#Commentary|Franks et al.]], 4:32&amp;ndash;6:26&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, another guest star for the episode was [[Kirsten Nelson]], who played interim police [[Karen Vick|chief Karen Vick]], a major reoccurring character who first premiered in the episode "Pilot".&lt;ref name="episode1"/&gt; Shortly before the installment was filmed, Kirsten Nelson gave birth to her daughter, which would later be portrayed in the episode "[[Shawn vs. the Red Phantom]]".&lt;ref name="begin 2909"&gt;[[#Commentary|Franks et al.]], 29:09&amp;ndash;29:51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="episode8"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Shawn vs. the Red Phantom]] |series=Psych |serieslink=Psych |credits=[[John T.

The show is meant to take place in the [[Southern California]] city of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]; however, most of the series is filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], and the surrounding communities. The majority of the scenes are filmed in the suburb community of [[White Rock, British Columbia|White Rock]], especially those including the ocean or coastline.&lt;ref name="Pilot Commentary"&gt;{{cite AV media |last=Franks |first=Steve |last2=Henze |first2=Chris |last3=Kulchak |first3=Kelly |title="Domestic Pilot" Audio Commentary: Psych, The Complete First Season |publisher=Universal Studios |medium=DVD |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about filming the show, Steve Franks stated that "I swear it's San Clemente, CA. It couldn't look more like it". In order to make the sets appear as Santa Barbara, the show's crew members installed many props stereotypical to Southern California, including fake palm trees, surfboards, and the California-published newspaper, the ''Santa Maria Sun''. The production crew had to truck in eight palm trees to each set during filming.&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman 2"&gt;[[#Goldman|Goldman (2006)]], p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the show's filming sets were changed between episodes. The Psych office was expanded and refurnished, afterwards becoming the second largest stage for the show.&lt;ref name="begin 712"&gt;[[#Commentary|Franks et al.]], 7:12&amp;ndash;8:46&lt;/ref&gt; The house for Henry Spencer was changed, in order to be closer to the ocean. The set for Chief Vick's office was also changed, and was repainted to brighten the scenes shot in it.&lt;ref name="begin 2741"&gt;[[#Commentary|Franks et al.]], 27:41&amp;ndash;28:00&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the episode was filmed on a sound stage, while several other scenes were filmed in the basement of the facility.&lt;ref name="begin 2244"&gt;[[#Commentary|Franks et al.]], 22:44&amp;ndash;22:58&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the installment was written to take place in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]'s [[Arlington Theater]].&lt;ref name="begin 1457"&gt;[[#Commentary|Franks et al.]], 14:57&amp;ndash;15:30&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the episode's scenes were written by Franks while filming the pilot episode.&lt;ref name="begin 3045"&gt;[[#Commentary|Franks et al.]], 30:45&amp;ndash;30:52&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to make the show seem more realistic, Franks and other writers talked to his father, a former [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles police officer]], and several psychics. Much of the episode's content was improvised by the actors, and Roday included a pineapple in the episode, continuing the reoccurring theme on the show.&lt;ref name="Pilot Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creative Freedom"&gt;{{cite news |last=Atkin |first=Hillary |title=‘Psych’s’ James Roday, Dule Hill Savor Series’ Creative Freedom |url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/features/psych_james_roday_dule_hill-1200327235/ |accessdate=September 1, 2013 |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |date=March 26, 2013 |oclc=60626272 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922165054/http://variety.com/2013/tv/features/psych_james_roday_dule_hill-1200327235/ |archivedate=September 22, 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Roday talked to producers about including singing in the series' second episode, but the idea was shut down because it was too soon in the show.

===Critical reception===
Since airing, the episode has received mixed to positive reviews. In his review for [[IGN]], contributor Colin Moriarty heavily criticized the episode, calling it "unintentionally lackluster".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; While Moriarty considered Hill to portray Gus well, he considered Juliet O'Hara and Carlton Lassiter's characters "rather forgettable" and stated that "neither character has any traits that make them interesting in the least".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; He considered the show to be "admittedly in a difficult spot".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Moriarty criticized the show's police force, calling it "possibly miscast".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; He called the episode "mildly entertaining and mildly boring" and that the show is "not looking too good".&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web |last=Moriarty |first=Colin |date=July 17, 2006 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/07/17/psych-spellingg-bee-review |title=Psych: "Spellingg Bee" Review |publisher=[[IGN]] TV |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installment was given a rating of 6, or "okay", tying it for the lowest rated episode of the season, with the following episode, "[[Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Piece]]".&lt;ref name="IGN 2"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |date=March 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/tv/psych/1 |title=Psych Preview&amp;mdash;Season 01 |work=Psych&amp;ndash;Show Highlights |publisher=IGN TV |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[The New York Times]]'', journalist Bill Carter mentions that after just the two episodes, "USA Network seems to have found another drama hit with 'Psych'".&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |last=Carter |first=Bill |date=July 17, 2006 |title=NBC Keeps Fingers Crossed for 'America's Got Talent' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=E4 |ISSN=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his review for [[TV Squad]], writer Richard Keller gave the episode a mixed to positive review, calling the installment "pretty unique",&lt;ref name="AOL"/&gt; but that it also had its flaws. He enjoyed the fact that the episode revealed the relationship between Shawn and Henry, that it "reflects the relationship many of us have with our own fathers".&lt;ref name="AOL"/&gt; He also enjoyed the "fleshing out" of Gus's character, that "we now see Gus as quite the brainiac" and "rather than saying nothing but 'No, Shawn'... Gus actually contributes quite a bit to this episode".&lt;ref name="AOL"/&gt; However, Keller also criticized parts of the episode, saying that he disliked the "whole fake psychic concept".&lt;ref name="AOL"/&gt; Keller also criticized Timothy Omundson's character Carlton Lassiter, saying "he just doesn't fit into the whole show", and "Omundson's makes Lassiter look like a cartoon character".&lt;ref name="AOL"&gt;{{cite news |last=Keller |first=Richard |date=July 15, 2006 |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2006/07/15/psych-spellingg-bee/ |title=Psych: Spellingg Bee |newspaper=[[TV Squad]] |publisher=[[AOL TV]] |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a comment for [[TV Guide]], the show was called "a diamond in the rough", and writer Matt Roush called star [[James Roday]] "a delight".&lt;ref name="TV Guide review"&gt;{{cite web |last=Roush |first=Matt |date=July 21, 2006 |url=http://www.tvguide.com/roush/Thanks-24995.aspx |title=Thanks so much for your ... |work=What's Hot |publisher=TV Guide |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was included in [[Yahoo!

In a review of the [[Syfy]] channel series ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'', ''[[Boston Globe]]'' critic Matthew Gilbert compared the series to ''Psych'', describing both as having "light-hearted [[comedy-drama|dramedic]] tones".&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gilbert |first=Matthew |date=July 18, 2006 |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2006/07/18/sci_fi_takes_quirks_to_nth_degree_in_eureka/ |title=Sci Fi takes quirks to nth degree in 'Eureka' |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |ISSN=0743-1791 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the episode aired, Virginia Rohan of ''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]'' called the show a "promising series".&lt;ref name="The Record"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rohan |first=Virginia |date=July 16, 2006 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-126419559.html |title=Why we love our cop shows |newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]] |OCLC=10806291 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several critics compared the episode and show to the then-new [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] network series [[Angela's Eyes]]; in his article for the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', journalist David Kronke stated that "Lifetime's new crime drama 'Angela's Eyes' is essentially the USA Network's new series 'Psych' inside out and played without laughs".&lt;ref name="LA"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kronke |first=David |date=July 16, 2006 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9099220.html |title=Liars can run, but they can't hide from Angela's 'Eyes' |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |ISSN=0458-3035 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for the [[Akron Beacon Journal]], ''Angela's Eyes'' main character Abigail Spencer was compared to Shawn Spencer, who was described as being "so good that people don't believe what he can figure out".&lt;ref name="Akron"&gt;{{cite news |author=Heldenfels, R.D. |date=July 16, 2006 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-148242676.html |title=Abigail Spencer is an FBI agent working with Joe Cobden (left) and... |newspaper=[[Akron Beacon Journal]] |OCLC=34332280 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Psych'' was also described as having "a much simpler premise", but being more entertaining than ''Angela's Eyes".&lt;ref name="Akron"/&gt;

The installment has been very positively received by the show's cast and crew. Series creator Steve Franks was asked by [[iTunes]] in 2009 to select his twelve favorite episodes to be put on a special DVD release. The collection, titled ''Psych: Twelve Episodes That Will Make You Happy'', contained four episodes from the first season, including "Spellingg Bee". When describing the episode, Franks stated that "The Spellingg Bee has my one of my favorite scenes in the run of the show when Shawn takes over for the spellmaster and has to investigate a murder while making up words for the contestants to spell".&lt;ref name="12 Episodes"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Franks, Steve |year=2009 |title=Psych: Twelve Episodes That Will Make You Happy |medium=Compilation DVD |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/psych-twelve-episodes-that/id303370528 |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |publisher=[[Universal Network Television|Universal Network Television LLC]] |location=[[Universal City, California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, iTunes asked stars James Roday and Dulé Hill to select their 20 favorite episodes from the show.

[[File:Children and Youth Sports School in Sevastopol 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sports school in [[Sevastopol]]]]
A '''sports school''' ({{lang-ru|Детско-Юношеская Спортивная Школа, ДЮСШ}}) is a type of educational institution for children that originated in the [[Soviet Union]]. Sports schools were the basis of the powerful system of physical culture (fitness) and sports education in the USSR and the [[Eastern Bloc]], particularly [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faupel|first1=Sarah|title=Germany's elite schools nurture sports stars in the making |url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-elite-schools-nurture-sports-stars-in-the-making/a-5938501|accessdate=4 June 2017|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=29 August 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hersh|first1=Philip|title=Some of the Elements of the Disgraced East German Sports Machine Remain Part of the Training Culture of the United Nation|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-09-12/sports/0009120168_1_east-german-sports-sports-research-center-berlin-wall|accessdate=4 June 2017|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=12 September 2000|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main features of this system remain in the system of sports education in [[Russia]] and other post-Soviet states, and also became the basis of similar systems in other countries, one of the most powerful ones at the present time being that of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Rev"&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/11-9-2004-61432.asp Sam Wollaston on China's Sports Schools]&lt;/ref&gt; Many legendary athletes, such as [[Nikolai Andrianov]], [[Nellie Kim]], [[Alexander Popov (swimmer)|Alexander Popov]], [[Viktor Krovopuskov]], [[Vladislav Tretiak]], [[Valeri Kharlamov]], [[Anatoly Alyabyev]] and [[Sergey Bubka]] started their path to [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] success from Soviet sports schools.

==Establishment and early years==
The system of sports schools was founded in the 1930s. In 1934, [[Young Pioneers Stadium]] was built in [[Moscow]], the first specialized sports extracurricular institution in the USSR. In the same year the first children's collective was established by [[Dynamo (sports society)|Dynamo sports society]]; this was a prototype of sports schools by [[Voluntary Sports Societies of the USSR|sports societies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dynamo.org.ru/history/99.html Ого Вфсо "Динамо" - Всероссийское Физкультурно-Спортивное Общество "Динамо"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220165626/http://dynamo.org.ru/history/99.html |date=2008-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935-1936, the first sports schools were opened in Moscow, [[Leningrad]] and other cities of the USSR; they were created and functioned on the basis of regulations, approved by the Central Soviet of Sports Societies and Organizations of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educom.ru/ru/publications/press/system/review.php Хрнпхвеяйхи Нагнп Бнгмхймнбемхъ Х Пюгбхрхъ Яхярелш Бмеьйнкэмнцн Напюгнбюмхъ Б Лняйбе - Деоюпрюлемр Напюгнбюмхъ Ц. Лняйбш&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1940s dozens of schools functioned in the USSR by [[Dynamo (sports society)|Dynamo sports society]], [[Spartak (sports society)|Spartak sports society]], [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CDKA]], sports societies of Trade Unions, [[OSOAVIAKHIM]] and in the system of education. After the [[Great Patriotic War]], sports schools were frequently reorganized, transferred from the jurisdiction of sports societies to that of the system of education and vice versa.

Separate from these were two national sports universities under government operation: the Leningrad and Moscow Sports Institutes, which were the major sports institutions for adult level national athletes.

==Olympic Reserve specialized (complex) schools==
After the USSR joined as a full member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1951, Specialized Children and Youth (Sports) Schools of the Olympic Reserve ({{lang-ru|Специализированная Детско-Юношеская (Спортивная) Школа Олимпийского Резерва, СДЮ(С)ШОР}}) began to be opened to prepare young athletes for the sports of highest achievements. The number of such sports schools grew, as did the number of sports disciplines within sports schools. They included not only [[Olympic sports]], but also national sports disciplines as well as tourism, [[orienteering]], and other sports. As an alternative there is also Complex Specialized Children and Youth School of the Olympic Reserve ({{lang-uk|Комплексна Спеціалізована Дитячо-Юнацька Школа Олімпійського Резерву, КСДЮШОР}}).

==Schools of Higher Sports Mastery==
Aside of regular sports schools and specialized schools of Olympic Reserve, there are also schools of higher sports mastery ({{lang-uk|Школа вищої спортивної майстерності, ШВСМ}}).

== Regional boarding schools of sports profile (Schools of Olympic Reserve) ==

Before 1989 in the Soviet Union existed a network of regional boarding schools of sports profile ({{lang-ru|ОШИСП, Областная школа-интернат спортивного профиля}}).&lt;ref name=fiskalov&gt;Fiskalov, V. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=61v3CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT401&amp;lpg=PT401&amp;dq=%D0%9E%D0%A8%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%9F&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1tivxxnwZs&amp;sig=-L-j0EU0BvhDVvgcD6qBOgdXt-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4p9qgmYraAhWJ24MKHdDjA0cQ6AEIQDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%D0%9E%D0%A8%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%9F&amp;f=false Theoretical foundations and organization of athlete training (Теоретические основы и организация подготовки спортсменов)''. Litres, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Children live, study and receive advanced sports training there. Sports boarding schools can be either one-sport-oriented or multisports. In those schools children spend most of their time off studying practicing sports or perfecting certain skills. In 1989 all sports boarding schools were converted to schools of Olympic Reserve, UOR ({{lang-ru|училище олимпийского резерва, УОР}}).&lt;ref name=fiskalov/&gt;

==Structure==
Sports schools were compatible with the administrative division of the country: there were District, City, Oblast, Central, Republican sports schools. To enter sports school, a child could have a recommendation from one's secondary school; children were also invited to come into a certain sports school for the selection during lessons in an ordinary school, or they could come for the selection on their own initiative. In accordance with specifics of different sports disciplines, the age of children and youth admitted into a sports school was between 8 and 14. Groups were organized according to [[Unified Sports Classification System of the USSR|ranks of athletes]]: there were separate groups for Second-Class Junior Sportsmen, First-Class Junior Sportsmen, Second-Class Sportsmen, First-Class Sportsmen, Candidates for Master of Sports of the USSR, Masters of Sports of the USSR. Term of study in each group was one to two years, with different sports normatives applied in each year.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt;

==Popularity==
By 1971 there were 3,813 sports schools in the USSR, with some 1.3 million children and youth training there. These included 2,434 schools with one million attendees under the jurisdiction of the system of education and 1,245 schools with 340,000 attendees functioning in the system of sports societies.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd ed., [http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00022/84400.htm entry on sports schools]&lt;/ref&gt; And by 1991, some 6,000 sports schools functioned in the USSR.

== Criticism ==

Sports schools, especially the Olympic reserve ones have been in the spotlight of several scandals related to child abuse. In their strive to get the best out of children, a lot of coaches resort to verbal abuse as well as severe and sometimes sadistic physical punishments. The situation is even worse in sports boarding schools where parents exercise little control and children are fully under the coaches' authority.

Another disadvantage of this system is that much more attention is paid to sports than school education. Sports boarding schools of Olympic reserve received the sarcastic nickname "hit-and-run" ({{lang-ru|бей-беги}}; not be confused with a traffic accident or a baseball play), meaning that children mostly hit footballs and ran around sports fields instead of studying.

==Sports schools in post-Soviet states==
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|break-up of the USSR]], the system of children and youth sports in Russia passed through difficult times, but managed to retain the network of sports schools, and Physical Training Clubs (DYuKFP) were created in addition to them.

In 2005 some 4,951 sports schools and DYuKFPs functioned in the system of education and in the system of Rossport. To the former belonged 2,944 institutions of physical culture and sports education: 1,917 sports schools, 464 Specialized sports schools of the Olympic Reserve, 556 DYuKFPs and 7 centers for physical culture. Only sports schools of the system of education were attended by some 2 million children and youth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov.ru/files/materials/1635/Sved_ob_uchregd.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716060824/http://www.ed.gov.ru/files/materials/1635/Sved_ob_uchregd.doc |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they had more than 13,000 departments in 122 sports disciplines. Rossport institutions were attended by some one million young athletes.

==Sports schools in other countries==
[[File:Singapore Sports School 20, Jul 07.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Singapore Sports School]] ]]
Soviet experience of mass children and youth sports education was applied by Eastern Europe an countries, in particular East Germany, where they were called ''Kinder- und Jugendsportschule (KJS)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Naul | first = Roland |author2=Hardman, Ken | title = Sport and Physical Education in Germany | pages = 61 | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Routledge]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?q=suitable+entry+children+youth+KJS | isbn = 0-419-25390-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, [[Katarina Witt]] and [[Sven Fischer]] attended such schools. Similar sports schools were established in the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]] and [[Cuba]] (called Schools for Sports Initiation there),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =  Rhoden | first = William C. | title = PAN AMERICAN GAMES; The Secret of Cuba's Sports Success?

At the present time some 3,000 sports schools exist in the People's Republic of China, including full-time ones, and this system is essentially based on the powerful system of sports schools of the USSR.&lt;ref name="Rev"/&gt;

There are a number of sports schools in Asian countries. These include [[Singapore Sports School]] in Singapore and [[Bukit Jalil Sports School]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia. Both of these  schools were established after end of the Soviet Union (1991).

The '''Stephen Foster Collection and archives''' are the largest collection of primary source materials on the life and work of [[Stephen Foster]]. The collection consists of documents and other items of historical interest related to the life and work of Stephen Foster. It resides in the [[Stephen Foster Memorial]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Josiah K.

== History ==

The Stephen Foster archives are housed in the Stephen Foster Memorial which was designed by architect [[Charles Klauder]]. Its construction reflects the same style as the [[Cathedral of Learning]], and [[Heinz Chapel]] on the University of Pittsburgh's campus. The W.F. Trimble &amp; Son's Company was contracted to help erect the building on March 2, 1935.&lt;ref name=lilly&gt;{{cite web | title = Untitled Document | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~amerimus/AboutCollection.html | accessdate = 2015-10-27  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of {{convert|35000|cuft|m3}} of Indiana limestone, 400 [[short ton|tons]] (360,000&amp;nbsp;kg) of steel, and {{convert|2500|cuyd|m3}} of concrete.&lt;ref name=lilly/&gt; In 1930, Josiah Kirby Lilly began collecting all forms of Foster's music, letters, furniture, original manuscripts and instruments. He kept his collection in his own stone cottage in Indianapolis. He called it Foster Hall. Then in 1932 Josiah Kirby Lilly pledged more than 10,000 Foster items to form the initial archive collection. Other efforts began the necessary fund-raising. Lily and his son covered almost half of the cost at that time amounting to $550,000.&lt;ref name=tribmem&gt;{{cite web | title = Theater: A dramatic makeover for the Stephen Foster Memorial

Establishing the scope of Stephen Foster music and discography was conducted by Dr. Deane Root, the curator of the Stephen C. Foster Memorial at the University of Pittsburgh. He initiated the revision of the standard reference work on Stephen Foster music - "Songs and Compositions and Arrangements by Stephen Collins Foster 1826-1864" published in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wittlesey|first1=Walter|last2=Sonneck|first2=O,G.|title=Songs and Compostions and arrangements by Stephen Collins Foster 1826-1864|date=1915|publisher=Washington, Government Printing Office|location=Washington, D.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VcWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Horace+Waters+hymn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jMztTuOQVb&amp;sig=xhWVLhrULl2mSFvpXvc2Cc61V80&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBmoVChMImJKF_fXayAIVQ2w-Ch1aqwaP#v=onepage&amp;q=Horace%20Waters%20hymn&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new reference work, published with the Smithsonian Institution Press was assisted by the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archive of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center, New York City. At the time of the drafting of the new discography, other archives were reviewed. These were Stanford University, Stanford, CA; Yale University, New Haven, CT; Library of Congress, Washington, DC; Rodgers and Hammerstein Archive, Lincoln Center, New York City; and Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, and the Library of Congress, Music Division. Creating the new discography was aided by collectors throughout the United States and in foreign countries. These loaned their own catalogs, listed out specific records in their collections, and supplied other known listings. The examination of private, commercial auction lists and other retail mail offerings were also used to identify Foster pieces for purchase and to compare to the other listings.&lt;ref name=Creegan/&gt;

In updating the 1933 discography, Roote employed other materials. Slips came with the early-unmarked cylinders, and were often hand-written. These written descriptions were not attached to the cylinders themselves. This was not the case for labels pressed on a disc recordings which were badly deteriorated.&lt;ref name=Creegan/&gt;

One the collections notable recordings was a brown Wax Cylinder (c.1895) from Wheeling, WV. This recording by the vocalist Edward M. Favor is one of the earliest recordings in the archives. Its volume is faint and was intended to be used with a tube and earphone type machine. Historians assume that not more than 50 pieces were made of this cylinder.&lt;ref name=Creegan/&gt;

Research into creating a new, authoritative and complete discography included the review of marketing materials of the Edison Amberol record supplements were published every month from 1906 to the 1920s by the Edison Record sales staff in Orange, NJ, The purpose of the promotional materials was to keep the public and recording retailers up to date on the newest Edison releases. Edison's company wanted to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. His marketing materials were helpful in expanding the discography and identified marches by Sousa, a recitation by Davenport), violin solos by Spaulding, orchestra selections such as Herbert's Operetta Little Nemo, and a ballad by tenor Will Oakland (''Just Before the Battle Mother'').&lt;ref name=Creegan/&gt;

Though today recording companies are generally cooperative, creating a comprehensive discography was hampered by the usual business practices of controlling costs and the lack of financial incentives in the preservation of commercial record companies. At the time that a recording was made, it was not viewed as "a creation of recorded history", and files were maintained for "commercial control". Recording companies have not been found to support research into their own history in house or by outside researchers. For example, Columbia Records, established in the 1890s has little information on the thousands of cylinder recordings it sold.&lt;ref name=Creegan/&gt;

== Discography ==

The Stephen Foster archives are housed in the [[Stephen Foster Memorial]] on the campus of the [[University of Pittsburgh]], also the location of the Center For American Music (Pittsburgh). The contents were collected by various organizations and individuals who conducted their efforts between 1896 and 1925. The collection includes the acoustic recordings made in US during these years and are cataloged in a discography. This list describes the over 450 published and 32 unpublished acoustic recordings. In addition to the recording themselves, the collection documents biographical details along with accompanying photographs of the musicians, groups, vocalists and music publishers who performed or sold Foster's music.

The recordings were transferred from original cylinders and record albumns. The cylinders are of various speed, speeds and manufacture and origin. They are made of both wax and celluloid. The cylinders are recordings of songs that are from two and four minutes long (some longer). The long playing albumns (70 rpm), made of shellac, of the music were also transferred to audio cassettes. Disc recordings range from five to 12 inches. &lt;!-- Hillandale and lateral cut --&gt; Player piano rolls and music box perforated discs were also used at the time to play Foster's music, although these are not part of the collection.&lt;ref name=Creegan/&gt;

Contributors to the collection include: Creegan, The Association of Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC).&lt;ref name=Creegan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Creegan|first1=George C.|title=The Acoustic Recordings of Stephen C.

The '''West Sussex Grid for Learning''' (WSGfL) was launched by [[West Sussex]] [[County Council]] (WSCC), as part of the [[National Grid for Learning]] initiative. The National Grid for Learning (NGfL) was a [[United Kingdom]] Government-funded gateway to educational resources on the [[Internet]]. It featured many individually selected links to resources and materials deemed to be of high quality.

At the time of the launch, the WSGfL website was dedicated to the learning community of West Sussex - which included teachers, pupils, non-teaching staff and parents. However, the WSGfL is now much more. The WSGfL provides a filtered [[broadband]] connection, network services, online content and communities for all schools across West Sussex.

== South East Grid for Learning (SEGfL) ==

The South East Grid for Learning (SEGfL) covers a large geographical area. It is a populous consortium with over eight million residents and seventeen very different Local Authorities. SEGfL has 3,121 schools with 56,800 [[teachers]] and over 1,000,000 pupils.

SEGfL includes Bracknell Forest Borough Council, Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, Buckinghamshire County Council, East Sussex County Council, Hampshire County Council, Isle of Wight Council, Kent County Council, Medway Council, Portsmouth City Council, Reading Borough Council, Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, Slough Borough Council, Southampton City Council, Surrey County Council, West Berkshire Council, West Sussex County Council and Wokingham District Council.

== Contact ==

The WSGfL is managed and developed by the ICT Strategy &amp; Initiatives team who are part of Children &amp; Young People's Services at WSCC.

'''Training''' is teaching, or developing in oneself or others, any [[skill]]s and [[knowledge]] that relate to specific [[practicality|useful]] [[Competence (human resources)|competencies]]. Training has specific goals of improving one's [[wikt:capability|capability]], capacity, [[productivity]] and [[wikt:performance|performance]]. It forms the core of [[apprenticeship]]s and provides the backbone of content at [[institute of technology|institutes of technology]] (also known as technical colleges or polytechnics). In addition to the basic training required for a [[Trade (profession)|trade]], [[Employment|occupation]] or [[profession]], observers of the labor-market recognize {{As of|2008| lc = on}} the need to continue training beyond initial qualifications: to maintain, upgrade and update skills throughout [[career|working life]]. People within many professions and occupations may refer to this sort of training as [[professional development]].

== Types ==
[[File:Alpinistide treening Paldiski pangal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mountaineering]] training in [[Estonia]]. It involves both instruction and [[physical exercise]] in the [[outdoor education|outdoor environment]] to develop skills that are necessary for survival in [[rock climbing]].]]

=== Physical training===
{{main|Physical exercise}}
Physical training concentrates on mechanistic goals: training programs in this area develop specific skills or muscles, often with a view of peaking at a particular time. Some physical training programs focus on raising overall [[physical fitness]].

In [[military]] use, training means gaining the physical ability to perform and survive in [[combat]], and learning the many skills needed in a time of [[war]]. These include how to use a variety of [[weapons]], outdoor [[surviving|survival]] skills, and how to survive being captured by the enemy, among many others.  See [[military education and training]].

For psychological or physiological reasons, people who believe it may be beneficial to them can choose to practice [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]] training, or [[autogenic training]], in an attempt to increase their ability to relax or deal with stress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/india-news/relaxation-training-may-cut-hypertension-medication-among-elderly_10032216.html » Relaxation training may cut hypertension medication among elderly - Thaindian News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
While some studies have indicated relaxation training is useful for some medical conditions, autogenic training has limited results or has been the result of few studies.

=== On job training===
[[File:IBMComputerTrainingWorkshop.JPG|thumb|Computer skills training]]
{{see also|On-the-job training}}
Some commentators use a similar term for workplace learning to [[Performance improvement|improve performance]]: "[[training and development]]". There are also additional services available online for those who wish to receive training above and beyond that which is offered by their employers. Some examples of these services include career counseling, skill assessment, and supportive services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jobs.state.ak.us/jt/» Job Training - Alaska Department of worker and Workforce Development&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One can generally categorize such training as ''[[on-the-job]]'' or ''off-the-job''.

The [[on-the-job training]] method takes place in a normal working situation, using the actual [[tool]]s, equipment, documents or materials that trainees will use when fully trained. On-the-job training has a general reputation as most effective for vocational work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=on-the-job+training&amp;context=|title=UNESCO-UNEVOC|website=unevoc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.It involves employee training at the place of work while he or she is doing the actual job. Usually, a professional trainer (or sometimes an experienced employee) serves as the course instructor using hands-on training often supported by formal classroom training. Sometimes training can occur by using web-based technology or video conferencing tools.

[[Simulation]] based training is another method which uses technology to assist in trainee development. This is particularly common in the training of skills requiring a very high degree of practice, and in those which include a significant responsibility for life and property. An advantage is that simulation training allows the trainer to find, study, and remedy skill deficiencies in their trainees in a controlled, virtual environment. This also allows the trainees an opportunity to experience and study events that would otherwise be rare on the job, e.g., in-flight emergencies, system failure, etc., wherein the trainer can run 'scenarios' and study how the trainee reacts, thus assisting in improving his/her skills if the event was to occur in the real world. Examples of skills that commonly include simulator training during stages of development include piloting aircraft, spacecraft, locomotives, and ships, operating [[air traffic control]] airspace/sectors, [[power plant]] operations training, advanced military/defense system training, and advanced emergency response training.

Off-the-job training method takes place away from normal work situations — implying that the employee does not count as a directly productive worker while such training takes place. Off-the-job training method also involves employee training at a site away from the actual work environment. It often utilizes lectures, case studies, role playing, and simulation, having the advantage of allowing people to get away from work and concentrate more thoroughly on the training itself. This type of training has proven more effective in inculcating concepts and ideas{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. Many personnel selection companies offer a service which would help to improve employee competencies and change the attitude towards the job. The internal personnel training topics can vary from effective problem-solving skills to leadership training.

*A more recent development in job training is the On the Job Training Plan or OJT Plan. According to the United States Department of the Interior, a proper OJT plan should include: An overview of the subjects to be covered, the number of hours the training is expected to take, an estimated completion date, and a method by which the training will be evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jobs.state.ak.us/jt/ |title=Job Training |publisher=Jobs.state.ak.us |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion and spirituality ===

In [[religion|religious]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] use, training may refer to the purification of the mind, heart, understanding and actions to obtain a variety of spiritual goals such as (for example) closeness to [[God]] or freedom from [[dukkha|suffering]].  Note for example the institutionalised spiritual training of [[Threefold Training]] in Buddhism, Meditation in [[Hinduism]] or [[discipleship]] in [[Christianity]]. These aspects of training can be short term or last a lifetime, depending on the context of the training and which religious group it is a part of.

Compare religious [[ritual]].

====Parochial schools====
&lt;!-- This section may fit more comfortably in an article about education rather than in an article about training.
 --&gt;

[[Parochial school]]s are a fairly widespread institution in the United States. A parochial school is a primary or secondary school supervised by a religious organization, especially a Roman Catholic day school affiliated with a parish or a holy order. As of 2004, out of the approximately 50 million children who were enrolled in American [[grade school]]s, 4.2 million children attend a church-affiliated school, which is approximately 1 in 12 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/05/09/making_the_case_for_parochial_schools/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Jeff | last=Jacoby | title=Making the case for parochial schools | date=9 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Christian religion, for example, one can attend a church-affiliated [[college]] with the intent of getting a degree in a field associated with [[religious studies]]. Some people may also attend church-affiliated colleges in pursuit of a non-religious degree, and typically do it just to deepen their understanding of the specific religion that the school is associated with.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The largest non-public school system in the United States, the Catholic school system, operates 5,744 elementary schools and 1,206 secondary schools.

===Instructor's guides and Lesson Plans===
Instructor Guide (IG), is an important document available to an instructor. Specifically, it is used within a Lesson Plan, as the blueprint that ensures instruction is presented in proper sequence and to the depth required by the objectives. Objectives of a lesson plan:

* To ensure that instructors have considered all factors necessary to conduct a safe and effective lesson.
* To guide you in conducting lesson activities.
* To help maintain a constant check on training activities and students’ progress.
* To Standardize instruction.
* To inform training managers of what is being taught.&lt;ref&gt;US Navy, Center for Personal Professional Development  (2010). Navy Instructional Theory NAVEDTRA 14300A, Chapter 9 Course Materials. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artificial-intelligence feedback ===

Researchers have developed training methods for [[artificial intelligence|artificial-intelligence]] devices as well. [[Evolutionary algorithms]], including [[genetic programming]] and other methods of [[machine learning]], use a system of [[feedback]] based on "fitness functions" to allow [[computer programs]] to determine how well an entity performs a task. The methods construct a series of programs, known as a “population” of programs, and then automatically test them for "fitness", observing how well they perform the intended task. The system automatically generates new programs based on members of the population that perform the best. These new members replace programs that perform the worst. The procedure repeats until the achievement of optimum performance.&lt;ref&gt;
''Genetic Programming: An Introduction'', Wolfgang Banzhaf, [[Peter Nordin]], Robert E. Keller, and Frank D. Francone, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Inc., 1998
&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[robotics]], such a system can continue to run in [[Real time (media)|real-time]] after initial training, allowing [[robot]]s to adapt to new situations and to changes in themselves, for example, due to wear or damage. Researchers have also developed robots that can appear to mimic simple human behavior as a starting point for training.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Très honorable avec félicitations du jury''''', meaning "Very Honorable, with Committee Praise", is the highest academic distinction awarded in the [[France|French]] [[academic]] university system. 

The doctoral academic distinctions are, in ascending order, ''honorable'', ''très honorable'', ''très honorable avec félicitations du jury''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000267752&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id Arrêté du 7 août 2006]''&lt;/ref&gt; They are entirely distinct from bachelor's and master's distinctions, which are ''Assez bien'', ''Bien'' and ''Très bien'', as they are awarded by the Thesis Committee right after the thesis' Defense. The ''félicitations du jury'' are an exceptional distinction, requiring a positive secret vote by the Committee and a special memo to be written by the Committee Chairperson to justify this honor.

'''Twelfth grade''', '''senior year''', or '''grade 12''' is the final year of secondary school in most of North America. In other regions it is also equivalently referred to as class 12 or [[Year 13]]. In most countries students then graduate at age 17–18. Some countries have a [[thirteenth grade]], while other countries do not have a 12th grade/year at all. Twelfth grade is typically the last year of [[high school]]; graduation year.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], the twelfth grade is referred to as [[Year 12]]. In [[New South Wales]], students are usually 16 or 17 years old when they enter Year 12 and 17–18 years during graduation (end of year). A majority of students in Year 12 work towards getting an [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank|ATAR]] (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) or [[Overall Position|OP]] (Overall Position, which applies only to students in the state of Queensland), which will allow them access to courses at university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scsa.wa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/460293/Year-12-School-Achievement-Data-2017.PDF|title=Year 12 Student Achievement Data 2017|last=Garnett|first=Patrick|date=13 January 2018|website=https://www.scsa.wa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/460293/Year-12-School-Achievement-Data-2017.PDF|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/downloads/publications/qcaa_stats_yr12_enrol_cert_2016.pdf|title=2016 Data summary|last=Queensland Curriculum &amp; Assessment Authority|first=Queensland Government|date=13 January 2018|website=https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/downloads/publications/qcaa_stats_yr12_enrol_cert_2016.pdf|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;View Table 3.: 56.8% of Year 12 students receive an ATAR

http://www.cese.nsw.gov.au/state-of-education/images/pdf/school_education_AA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In South Australia, this is achieved by completing the [[South Australian Certificate of Education|SACE]]; in Victoria, this is achieved by completing the [[Victorian Certificate of Education|VCE]]; in the Australian Capital Territory, this is achieved by completing the [[ACT Scaling Test|AST]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsss.act.edu.au/years_11_and_12/act_scaling_test |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311202704/http://www.bsss.act.edu.au/years_11_and_12/act_scaling_test |archivedate=2014-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in New South Wales this is achieved by completing the [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|HSC]].&lt;ref name="aus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mceetya.edu.au/verve/_resources/Volume_1_CSSA_Final_Report.pdf|title=Cost/Benefit Analysis Relating to the Implementation of a Common School Starting Age and Associated Nomenclature by 1 January 2010|accessdate=2009-01-10|publisher=Atelier Learning Solutions Pty Ltd|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225162119/http://www.mceetya.edu.au/verve/_resources/Volume_1_CSSA_Final_Report.pdf|archivedate=25 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, when completing the [HSC], students are required to satisfactorily complete at least 10 units of study in ATAR courses which must include:
* eight units from Category A courses
* two units of English
* three Board Developed courses of two units or greater
* four subjects

Some Year 12s may receive a Year 12 Jersey. Schools choose the design, colours and writing which are printed or stitched onto the [[jersey]]. Sometimes the last two digits of the year they are graduating are printed on the back (for example, "12" for 2012 school leavers) along with a personalised nickname. The front may show the school emblem and the student's name, which is occasionally stitched in.

Many schools conduct end of year "formals" (similar to a [[senior prom]]). They are held from any time between graduation in September to November. Australian private schools often conduct Year 12 balls in January or February of Year 12 instead of an end of year formal.

==Belgium==
In [[Belgium]], the 12th grade is called ''6de middelbaar'' or ''laatste jaar'' in Dutch, ''rétho'' or ''6e année'' in French. In the General Education, this year guides and prepares students for their first year in University by recalling everything learned during the past six years of secondary school.
In the Skills Education, this year prepares the students for the professional life with an Intership in the chosen domain.

==Brazil==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
In [[Education in Brazil|Brazil]], the 12th grade is called ''terceiro ano do ensino médio'', also informally called ''terceiro colegial'', meaning literally third grade of high school. It is typically attended by 17–18 years old students. During this grade, most students apply to what is called [[Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio]] (ENEM), the Brazilian equivalent of the SATs in the US, and ''[[vestibular]]'', the individual entrance examination particular to each university.

As in many countries, Grade 12 students attend [[Graduation]], which involves a formal official ceremony, a party where students, relatives and friends are invited and another party just for the students.

==Bulgaria==
In [[Bulgaria]] the twelfth grade is the last year of high-school. Twelfth-grade students tend to be 18–19 years old. Usually students are preparing to take the Matriculation exam in the end of their 2nd semester.

==Canada==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
In [[Canada]], the twelfth grade is referred to as Grade 12. Grade 12 is the 12th year after kindergarten. Students generally enter their Grade 12 year when they are 16 or 17 years old. If they are 16 years old, they will be turning 17 by December 31 of that year. In many Canadian high schools, student during their year, hold a series of fundraisers, grade-class trips, and other social events.  Grade 12 Canadian students attend [[Graduation]] which usually involves an official ceremony and a dinner dance.

[[Ontario]] previously had [[Grade 13]], which was briefly renamed Ontario Academic Credit (OAC), before being phased out, leaving Grade 12 as the final year. Grades 12 and 13 were similar to [[sixth form]] in England.

[[Quebec]] is the lone province that does not have Grade 12; their students finish secondary school at the equivalent of Grade 11 and then do two years of [[College education in Quebec|college]] before going to university. Thus, when a student is in Grade 12 in Ontario, for instance, the student in Quebec is in his first year of college.

[[Newfoundland and Labrador]] did not introduce Grade 12 until 1983.

==Denmark==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
In [[Denmark]], the twelfth grade is the 3rd G, which is the final year of secondary school. 3.g is equivalent to 3rd grade of secondary school, or [[Gymnasium (Denmark)|gymnasium]]. This is not compulsory, as education is only compulsory through 9th grade. Students are often 18-19 or older when they finish secondary school. The age of graduation is caused by the fact that Danish children first start school at 6. The reason that many students will be at the age of 20 when they graduate is because some people choose to have one-year gap between the 9th grade and gymnasium's 1st G (the first year of secondary school), where students typically go to special art- or sport-oriented boarding schools or become exchange students all over the world. This is optional though; you can go directly to the first year of secondary school after 9th grade.

==Finland==
The twelfth grade is the third and usually last year (a fourth year is possible) of High School or secondary school (or [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]])
The students graduate from High School the year they turn 19. The twelfth grade is shorter than the previous ones because the twelfth graders lessons end in February and they go on to take their final exams shortly afterwards. 
Compulsory education ends after the ninth grade, so the upper grades are optional.

==France==
The equivalent grade in this country is [[:fr:Terminale (lycée)|Terminale]], it is the third and last year of lycée which is equivalent to High-School, upon completion of which students sit for a test, the [[French Baccalaureate|Baccalauréat]]. [[French language|French-language]] schools that teach the French government curriculum (i.e. are part of the [[AEFE]] network) use the same system of grades as their counterparts in France. This is not compulsory, as education is only compulsory until students turn 16.

==Germany==
In [[Education in Germany|Germany]], students wishing to take the ''[[Abitur]]'' usually had to attend a thirteenth grade, but most [[States of Germany|states]] are shortening the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (the university-bound secondary school system in Germany) from nine to eight years. But the recent tendency is re-introduction of the thirteenth year, as in Bavaria.

==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, 12th grade is called Form 6. Students in Form 6 are required to take the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE)

==Hungary==
In Hungary, students take a national exam called ''érettségi'' (lit. "maturity test") at the end of their 12th grade, except for certain vocational schools, where they only take a vocational exam. The érettségi exam consists of standard school subjects, everyone has to take an exam of literature and grammar, mathematics, and history, and they have to choose 2 other subjects, one of which has to be a foreign language, and, in most vocational schools, the other is a mixed test of vocational knowledge.

12th grade students often participate in graduation ceremonies before the érettségi exam. In most schools, there is a full-day ceremony on Friday or Saturday before the exam, which is called ''ballagás'' (lit. "going away", or "exiting"). In many schools, students attend to other ceremonies during their 12th grade as well. For example, many schools hold a ''szalagavató'' event (lit. "ribbon commencement") at the beginning of the school year, where 12th graders receive a ribbon or a similar emblem with the name of their high school and the beginning and closing year of their studies there, which they later wear on their coats. 12th grade students also often visit their teachers before the final exam, traditionally in the evening, either at their home or in the school, to sing them in the street below, and say farewell. This tradition is simply called ''serenade''. They also often take choir rehearsals before to learn how to sing together.

==India==
{{see also|Education in India}}
In [[India]], the equivalent grade is referred to as the "[[Higher Secondary Examination|HSC]]", or "plus 2" or in some regions "second year junior college" (SYJC) or PreUniversity Course (PUC). Most students who pass out of class 12 are 16–18 years old. With the introduction of separate [[entrance examination]]s for entry into [[MBBS|medicine]], [[Bachelor of Engineering|engineering]] and [[LLB|law]] courses. Entrance exams usually comprise multiple-choice-questions on [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]] (or [[mathematics]]) and are conducted separately on national and state levels. Additionally some highly coveted institutions hold their own entrance tests. These competitive exams are among the toughest in the world with JEE MAIN, administered by CBSE being the second most competitive entrance exam. Over 14,00,000 students also appear for the [[IIT-JEE]] exam, competing for 9,800 odd seats at the [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IITs]]. From this year, NEET exam has been introduced for all medical admissions barring a few and is considered tougher than JEE MAIN due to lesser seats. The [[AIIMS]] entrance test is also one of the toughest exams for admission to undergraduate courses in medicine. Around 80,000 students compete for 50 seats. The [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] and [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]] boards conduct twelfth standard courses nationally, while [[Higher Secondary (School) Certificate|state boards]] operate at the state-level.

==Ireland==
In the Republic of Ireland, it is the sixth and final year of [[Secondary School]], referred to as '''Sixth Year''' (for 17-18 year olds), in which students take the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate Examinations]]. Students usually attend a dance or formal party at the end of this year before they move on to third level education or start their adult lives: this is known as a Debs or Grad and is similar to prom in the United States.

==Israel==
In [[Education in Israel|Israel]], the twelfth grade is the third and last year of [[High School]]. Students typically begin this [[Educational stage|grade]] when they are about 17 years old, and in order to graduate, they have to pass and get a [[Bagrut]] certificate. Once finished, student are required to either serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli military]] or do the [[Sherut Leumi|Israeli community service]] for a time period (the number of years may vary).

==Italy==
In [[Italy]], the twelfth grade is the fourth year of the high school (which is called Scuola media superiore or [[Education in Italy#Scuola secondaria di secondo grado|Scuola secondaria di secondo grado]]). There are five years of high school total, sometimes grouped in different ways (2+3, 2+1+2), depending on the type of high school the student is attending. Students get the "Maturità", when they are at the fifth year of high school, ''de facto'' the [[thirteenth grade]].

[[File:Last Day of YMC Seniors of 2016.jpg|thumb|Last Day of [[Yeghishe Manoukian College]] Seniors of 2016, Lebanon.]]

==Lebanon==
In [[Lebanon]], the twelfth grade is the third year of high school, also referred to as The Third Year Of Higher Secondary Education. It can be called the class of seniors or the last class of school. People in the twelfth grade are between the ages of 17 and 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mehe.gov.lb/Templates/Internal.aspx?PostingId=151 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603192543/http://www.mehe.gov.lb/Templates/Internal.aspx?PostingId=151 |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaysia==
In Malaysia, the 12th grade is also known as Form 6 in secondary school which is further divided into Lower 6 and Upper 6. The students at this stage are 18 years old and will usually complete their schooling at 19 years old..

==Mexico==
In [[Mexico]], the twelfth grade is the last year of [[high school]], where students are normally aged 17–18. As in Mexico the education is divided in "primaria" (6 years), "secundaria" (3 years) and "preparatoria" or "bachillerato" (3 years), the twelfth grade is usually called "tercero de preparatoria" (third grade of preparatory) or "Quinto y Sexto Semestre" (Fifth and Sixth Semester).

==Netherlands==
In the [[Netherlands]], 12th grade is named by school level. From low to high: "[[Voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs|VMBO]]", "[[HAVO]]" and "[[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]]". VMBO is composed of four years, with 12th grade being the fourth (4th) and final year. A higher school level is the HAVO, which lasts for five (5) years. The highest school level is VWO, which lasts for six (6) years. So at the HAVO, students are considered senior if they are in "5th class", whereas at VWO, in "6th class" respectively. The last year mainly focuses on preparing for the final exams, after which students should be ready to go to college or university. Usually, 4th and 5th grade students are aged 16 to 17 and those who are in 6th grade usually are aged 17 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/education/Education-in-the-Netherlands_100816.html |title=Education in the Netherlands |publisher=[[Expatica]] |accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]], 12th grade is known as Year 13 (New Zealand students attend 13 years of school, starting at the age of 5). Students in Year 13 are usually 17–18 years old. This is the last year of secondary school. In Year 13, students complete NCEA Level 3, which involves getting a certain number of 'credits' from different external exams and other internal assessments. Students must gain 80 achieved credits or higher (20 of which are taken from Level 2) to pass the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/qualifications-standards/qualifications/ncea/understanding-ncea/how-ncea-works/ncea-levels-and-certificates/|title=NCEA levels and certificates|website=Nzqa.govt.nz|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norway==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
In [[Norway]], 12th grade does not officially exist, but its equivalent is the 2nd grade of secondary school, or gymnasium. This is not compulsory, as education is only compulsory until 10th grade.

Courses vary as students choose a specific programme in 1st grade of secondary school, or gymnasium. Examples of programmes are: General Studies, Media and Communication, Health and Care, Industrial work, Design and craftmanship, agriculture. There are 12 national programmes, where 9 will get the students ready for work, and 3 will prepare the students for more advanced studies. Two of the vocational programs (media and communication, and agriculture) may also prepare the students for more advanced studies if taken a third year.

==Pakistan==
In [[Pakistan]], the twelfth grade is the second year of college (the first being the eleventh grade) and is equivalently called the "second year." Students who graduate from the second year are normally between seventeen and eighteen years old. For entrance into universities, students undergo standardized exams like [[ECAT Pakistan|ECAT]], [[MCAT Pakistan|MDCAT]] and exams conducted by the [[National Testing Service|NTS]].

==Philippines==
From 1945 until 2011, the basic education system was composed of six years of [[Elementary school|elementary education]] starting at the age of 6, and four years of [[high school|high school education]] starting at the age of 12 (in which the fourth year was the equivalent of tenth grade/Grade 10). Further education was provided by technical or vocational schools, or in higher education institutions such as universities. Although the [[1987 Constitution]] stated that elementary education was compulsory, this was never enforced.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 2011, the country started to transition from its old 10-year basic educational system to a K to 12 educational system as mandated by the Department of Education; the department stated that the 10-year basic educational system was congested and designed for twelve years of teaching, not ten. Thus, the K to 12 system was introduced in order to establish educational continuity not just integrated with the [[ASEAN]] region system of basic education but aligned with the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="K12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/Kto12%20Primer%20as%20of%20Dec%202011.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522231741/http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/Kto12%20Primer%20as%20of%20Dec%202011.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-22 |title=K-12 Primer as of 20 December 2011 |publisher=[[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 12-year system is currently compulsory, along with the adoption of an improved, decongested curriculum for all schools (see [[Education in the Philippines#2010s and the K to 12 program|2010s and the K–12 program]]). The transition period will end with the 2017–2018 school year, which is the first graduation year for the first group of students who entered the new educational system. Grade 12 is the second year of Senior High School and is now the new final year of high school prior to employment, entrepreneurship, or college/university in the country. Students are usually 17 – 18 years old.

==Portugal==
In [[Portugal]], the 12th grade is considered the last year of compulsory education and the last year of high school. Students choose 5 out of a wide range of subjects, one of which being mandatorily physical education. Out of the other four, two of them are the subjects that will be evaluated in their final exams or national exams (exames nacionais), one must be considered a branch of one of the two subjects that have been already evaluated in the 11th grade national exams and the last can be a broadening of an already studied subject or a whole new one.
The obligatory subjects (submitted to nacional exams)depend on the field the student chose to study in the 10th grade:arts; science and technologies (best known as science);socioeconomic sciences (economy); humanistic and linguistic sciences (humanities) or a professional/technical course. Even inside a field, you can opt between speciefics (subjects, whose exam is compulsory to a certain college course application), depending on what the student intends to study in college and on which university he plans to attend.

==South Africa==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
In [[South Africa]], Grade 12 is the final year of high school. It is more commonly referred to as '''matric''', which is itself short for matriculation. ''(See [[Matriculation in South Africa]])''.

At the end of Grade 12, students are said to be matriculated. This also refers to the minimum requirement for progressing to University. On average, Grade 12 students are between the ages of 17 and 19.

==Spain==
The closest equivalent to twelfth grade in [[Spain]] is the second year of Bachillerato, required for attending college.

==Sweden==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
In [[Sweden]], the twelfth grade does not officially exist, but its equivalent is the 3rd grade of secondary school, or gymnasium. This is not compulsory, as education is only compulsory until 9th grade.

Courses vary as students choose a specific programme in 1st grade of secondary school, or gymnasium. Examples of programmes are: Nature and science, Arts, Economics, Health and care, Industry. There are 18 national programmes, where 12 of them will get the students ready for work, and 6 will prepare the students for more advanced studies.

Students graduate the same year they'll turn 19, depending on if you are born early or late in the year you are either 19 or 18 at the day of your graduation.

==Turkey==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
In [[Turkey]], 12th grade is the last year of high school and compulsory education. In March, students who are interested to go to college take a test named Transition to Higher Education Examination (YGS). In this exam, students have to answer 160 questions (40 Turkish, 31 Maths, 9 Geometry, 15 History, 12 Geography, 8 Philosophy, 5 Religious Knowledge, 13 Biology, 14 Physics, 13 Chemistry) in 160 minutes. Those who answer correct at least 25% of this questions are allowed to take the Undergraduate Placement Examination (LYS). This exam also has different sessions for different branches, which include Mathematics, Geometry, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Turkish Literature, History, Geography, Philosophy, Religious Knowledge and Foreign Languages. It is not compulsory to take all of the subjects. Students usually are at the age of 18 at the end of the year.

===England and Wales===
In [[Education in England|England]] and [[Education in Wales|Wales]], "[[Year 13]]" (or "upper [[Sixth form|Sixth]]") is the last year of [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]] certifications, which are completed at the end of the year. Students are usually 16-17 in [[Year 12]] and 17-18 in Year 13. In Northern Ireland this takes place in Years 13 and [[Year 14|14]]. In England, these two years are now compulsory until the age of 18 (after which a student can leave education if they choose without necessarily completing year 13) as of 2015 and are generally required for entry into [[higher education]]. There exist specific [[sixth form college]]s dedicated to these years of education, sometimes known as "[[further education]]" to distinguish it from both [[secondary education]], which is compulsory, and [[higher education]], which implies [[university]] studies.

===Scotland===
In [[Scotland]], this is sixth year (or S6). Sufficiently good marks in 5th year may be adequate for entry into higher education. Highers are the entry qualifications to university which can be sat in S5, S6 and college, with Advanced Highers being the equivalent to year one of university&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/13813.html|title=SQA|website=Sqa.org.uk|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be sat following higher exams.

===Northern Ireland===
In Northern Ireland, there is a 7th year of primary school and a 7th year of secondary school.

==United States==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
The twelfth grade is the twelfth school year after [[kindergarten]]. It is also the last year of compulsory [[secondary education]], or "[[High school (North America)|high school]]". Students often enter the grade as 17- and 18-year-olds and graduate as mostly 17 or 18-year-olds depending on their birthday. Twelfth graders are referred to as ''Seniors''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Many students consider the twelfth grade a year to relax and prepare for transition out of their old lives into college/university or the workplace. Others take advantage of the opportunity to complete additional higher level courses, such as [[Advanced Placement]] and [[International Baccalaureate]], to earn credits for college/university.

[[Mathematics]] courses normally include [[Precalculus]], [[Trigonometry]], College Prep Math, [[Advanced Placement Calculus]], [[Advanced Placement Statistics]], Probability and Statistics, or SUPA Calculus.

[[Science]] courses include [[Advanced Placement Chemistry]], [[Advanced Placement Biology]], [[Advanced Placement Environmental Science]], [[Astronomy]]/[[Meteorology]], CSI [[Forensic Science]], [[Marine Biology]] or [[Advanced Placement Physics B]], [[Advanced Placement Physics C: Mechanics]], or [[Advanced Placement Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism]].

[[Social Studies]] courses include Government Law, Economics, [[Advanced Placement United States Government and Politics]], [[Advanced Placement Comparative Government and Politics]], [[Advanced Placement Psychology]], [[Advanced Placement European History]], [[Advanced Placement Microeconomics]], or [[Advanced Placement Macroeconomics]].  
  
[[English language|English]] classes include [[Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition]], Film and Literature, Sports and Literature, or Contemporary Lit. Popular works include ''[[Beowulf]]'', ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', Goethe's ''[[Faust]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'', and ''[[Brave New World]]'', as well as works of Romantic poets such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[John Keats]], [[William Wordsworth]], and [[Emily Dickinson]].

[[Art]] classes include [[Advanced Placement Art History]], [[Advanced Placement Studio Art]], [[Advanced Placement Music Theory]], Applied art in Theatre, Music Theory For Garage Band Musicians, IB Musical Analysis, IB Theatre Arts, Advanced [[Technical Theatre]], Advanced Photography, Advanced Cyramics, Fashion Design and Illustration, Theatre Dance, Jazz Dance, IB Dance Studies Madrigal Singers, [[Jazz]] Singers, or [[Wind Ensemble]].

[[Technology]] classes include [[Advanced Placement Computer Science]], Java, Advanced Web Design, and [[C++]] Programming.

[[Business]] classes include College Marketing, College Entrepreneurship, Sports and Entertainment Marketing, College Preparatory Interview Classes, and Advanced Fundamentals in Business.

[[Health|Wellness]] classes include [[Physical Education]], [[Health]] (if not yet taken), [[Olympic weightlifting|Weightlifting]], and Advanced Training in First Aid.

===Traditions associated with senior year===
In the United States and some other countries, there is a [[graduation]] event near to the end of the school year (typically in May or June) more formally referred to as commencement, where "seniors" formally graduate from high school and receive their diplomas.

In many schools, seniors sit for formal [[senior portraits]] at the beginning of the school year or the summer prior to their senior year. These portraits are used in the upcoming graduating class' [[yearbook]]. The senior portraits in the yearbook are either in full color or black and white, but bigger than the smaller black and white pictures typically used for lower grades.  Many modern yearbooks are in full color. Some may have a caption other than the student's name, or a quote from the student.

There is a formal dance for this year's students, called [[senior prom]]. Some schools hold a combined prom for juniors and seniors, while others segregate the two grades into separate dances.

[[Senior Skip Day|Senior skip day]] (also known as senior ditch day) is a day during which the seniors do not attend school and skip all their classes. This event/tradition is often not recognized by school administrations and teachers. In some areas it is countered with an officially recognized senior day off, or by allowing graduating seniors to skip their final tests ("final exams"). This official senior day can also be used to sponsor a "senior field trip" or "senior class trip" where the class would, for example, go to a theme park, a lake, a resort,  the beach, or some other vacation-type activity. Following graduation, many seniors go on [[Senior Week]], where they spend a week at the beach with their friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bryant|first=Dawn|title=Senior Week: A blessing, a curse|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bMpOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Vh8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6416,3287832&amp;dq=senior-week+beach&amp;hl=en|agency=Knight Ridder|work=Morning Star|location=Wilmington, NC|page=7B|date= June 13, 2002|accessdate= February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many seniors that are in the arts (but sometimes other areas), such as band or choir, will have the opportunity to go on an extended vacation following graduation. The students, faculty, parents, and other people may fund the trip through fundraisers, donations, etc. Travel usually involves going out of the local state, and possibly overseas.

In some schools, Seniors receive a [[class ring]] at the beginning of their senior year.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} A "senior prank" is another common tradition in which the class may contribute towards a [[practical joke]] on the school,  administration, or local community. A related tradition is the senior class either raising money or contributing money for equipment or other things to the school as a token of gratitude and respect for the school's support of the seniors. An example of this could be a senior class contributing money for a new weight room for the school or a state-of-the-art telescope for the science department.  A similar project could involve the outside local community as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20479">'''Unaccredited institutions of higher education''' are [[college]]s, [[trade school]]s, [[seminary|seminaries]], and [[university|universities]] which do not have formal [[higher education accreditation|educational accreditation]].

Educational institutions may not be legally required to obtain independent accreditation, depending on local laws. [[Academic degree]]s or other qualifications from such unaccredited institutions may or may not be accepted by [[civil service]] or other employers, depending on the local laws, the institution's reputation, and the industry standards.

An institution may not obtain or maintain accreditation for one of several reasons. As accreditation processes often require several years' work, a new institution may not yet have completed the initial accreditation process.  A long-established institution may have lost accreditation due to financial difficulties or other factors. Other institutions (for example, some [[Bible college]]s and [[seminary|seminaries]]) choose not to participate in the accreditation process because they view it as an infringement of their religious, academic, or political freedom.

All fraudulent [[diploma mills]] are also unaccredited schools, although they may claim accreditation from an unrecognized agency.  Accreditation from such organizations, known derisively as [[accreditation mill]]s, is unrecognized by any government or reputable private entity, and any courses taken or degrees received from such a school are generally considered invalid.

==Australia==
In Australia, it is a criminal offence to use the term "university" or to purport to offer university degrees (Bachelors, Masters, Doctors) without government authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Australian Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations|url=http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/higher_education/policy_issues_reviews/key_issues/assuring_quality_in_higher_education/the_role_of_the_australian_government.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050717130044/http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/higher_education/policy_issues_reviews/key_issues/assuring_quality_in_higher_education/the_role_of_the_australian_government.htm|archivedate=2005-07-17|title=The Role of the Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; This authorization is generally given in the form of an Act of a State or Federal Parliament, specifically referring to that institution. (Each state will recognize the institutions authorized under the law of the other states.)

Separate to this, there is also the authorization under the Higher Education Funding Act to receive federal government funds for students; this is a separate process from authorization to grant degrees, so some institutions are entitled to grant degrees but not to receive government funds to do so.

There is also registration under CRICOS (the ESOS Act) - a student visa can only be issued to a student if they are studying at an institution with a valid CRICOS registration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Australian Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations|url=http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/higher_education/policy_issues_reviews/key_issues/assuring_quality_in_higher_education/fake_degrees.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525003938/http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/higher_education/policy_issues_reviews/key_issues/assuring_quality_in_higher_education/fake_degrees.htm|archivedate=2005-05-25|title=Fake Degrees and Unaccredited Higher Education Providers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}

All universities and colleges are currently state or municipal organizations, funded directly from public funds. There is no process for accrediting private universities, and public universities are not allowed to collect tuition fees from full-time students. The last private university to be nationalized was [[Åbo Akademi]] (1981).

==India==
According to the India Department of Education, regarding institutions without accreditation or an Act of Parliament, "It is emphasized that these fake institutions have no legal entity to call themselves as University/Vishwvidyalaya and to award ‘degrees’ which are not treated as valid for academic/employment purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Indian Ministry of Human Resource Development |url=http://www.education.nic.in/htmlweb/he-centraluniversities-list.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009183806/http://www.education.nic.in/htmlweb/he-centraluniversities-list.htm |archivedate=2006-10-09|title=Brief Write - Fake Universities/institutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
Legitimate higher education qualifications in Ireland are placed on, or formally aligned with, the National Framework of Qualifications. This framework was established by the [[National Qualifications Authority of Ireland]] in accordance with the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act (1999). It is illegal under the Universities Act (1997) for any body offering higher education services to use the term "university" without the permission of the Minister for Education and Science. It is likewise illegal under the Institutes of Technologies Acts (1992–2006) to use the term "institute of technology" or "regional technical college" without permission.

==The Netherlands==
Dutch academic titles are legally protected and can only be used by graduates from accredited Dutch institutions of higher education. Illegal use is considered a misdemeanor and subject to legal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/DerdeBoek/TitelII/Artikel435/geldigheidsdatum_21-10-2009 |title=Art. 435 Sr |language=nl |publisher=Wetten.overheid.nl |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2010-07-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100718053759/http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/DerdeBoek/TitelII/Artikel435/geldigheidsdatum_21-10-2009| archivedate= 18 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.nl/translate?prev=hp&amp;hl=nl&amp;js=y&amp;u=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/DerdeBoek/TitelII/Artikel435/geldigheidsdatum_21-10-2009&amp;sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;history_state0=&amp;swap=1 |title=Art. 435 Sr (translated by Google) |language=nl |publisher=Translate.google.nl |date= |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holders of foreign degrees need special permission before being able to use a recognised Dutch title, but they are free to use their own foreign title (untranslated).&lt;ref&gt;Article 7.23, paragraph 3 of the Dutch Higher Education and Scientific Research Act provides the Informatie Beheer Groep (now called DUO, i.e. the Service for Implementing the Education) with the possibility to grant such a permission&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Informatie Beheer Groep (IB-Groep) is a service (now called DUO) of the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science &lt;http://www.ibgroep.nl/International_visitors/Welcome.asp&gt;{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More information on legislation on {{cite web|url=http://www.ibgroep.nl/International_visitors/Diploma_assessment/diploma_assessment.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719050200/http://www.ibgroep.nl/International_visitors/Diploma_assessment/diploma_assessment.asp |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Application forms via [http://www.ib-groep.nl/Images/5263_tcm7-13935.pdf Application for a recognized Dutch title (in Dutch)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714121456/http://www.ib-groep.nl/Images/5263_tcm7-13935.pdf |date=2010-07-14 }} and [http://www.ib-groep.nl/Images/5263E_tcm7-13910.pdf Application for a recognized Dutch title (in English)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124103810/http://ib-groep.nl/Images/5263E_tcm7-13910.pdf |date=2010-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
The [[New Zealand]] Education Act prohibits use of the terms "degree" and "university" by institutions other than the country's eight accredited universities. In 2004 authorities announced their intention to take action against unaccredited schools using the words "degree" and "university," including the University of Newlands, an unaccredited distance-learning provider based in the [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] suburb of [[Newlands, New Zealand|Newlands]]. Other unaccredited New Zealand institutions reported to be using the word "university" included the New Zealand University of Golf in Auckland, the online Tawa-Linden and Tauranga Universities of the Third Age, and the Southern University of New Zealand. Newlands owner Rochelle M. Forrester said she would consider removing the word "university" from the name of her institution in order to comply with the law.&lt;ref&gt;David Cohen, [http://chronicle.com/daily/2004/08/2004082603n.htm New Zealand Vows a Crackdown on Diploma Mills in Wake of Unusual Defamation Lawsuit], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', August 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

After the University of Newlands was listed as a "wannabe" or "degree mill" by ''[[The Australian]]'' newspaper, the institution was given permission by the New Zealand High Court to proceed to trial in its suit against the paper's publisher for [[defamation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aus.ac.nz/publications/tertiary_update/2004/No32.htm{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{Full citation needed|date=August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding judge noted that such degrees may be illegal and that purporting to offer such degrees could be deemed dishonest or unethical conduct. He also ruled that defamation occurs in the country where the material is downloaded from the Internet. In December 2005 the Court of Appeal said the defamation case could not go ahead. Newlands and Ms. Forrester had not shown it had a good arguable case that an act had been done in New Zealand for which damages could be claimed from a party outside New Zealand. Without their showing a good arguable case, New Zealand courts would not assume jurisdiction.

==South Korea==
In March 2006 prosecutors in Seoul had "broken up a crime ring selling bogus music diplomas from Russia, which helped many land university jobs and seats in orchestras."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2006/03/21/2003298471 South Korea - Bogus diploma ring busted], [[Taipei Times]], March 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; People who used these degrees were criminally charged.

== Sri Lanka ==
According to Sri Lankan law, it is a criminal offense to use the term "university" or to purport to offer university degrees (Bachelors, Masters, Doctors) without government authorization in Sri Lanka.

==Switzerland==
In Switzerland no prior authorisation is required in order to offer higher education courses, organise examinations or issue private degrees. In certain cases, however, the federal or cantonal authorities, depending on their respective area of authority, will supervise private institutions and/or authorise them to offer courses and issue degrees. This supervision means that private institutions are required to accept a certain amount of public control. They must undergo quality inspections if they wish to issue protected titles that will be recognised as such. Non protected titles are nevertheless common.
Private institutions that are not part of Switzerland's public higher education sector, are not compatible with it, or are not entirely supervised by public authorities offer a different, but not necessarily lower, level of quality. There are several prestigious private institutions that are entirely independent from Switzerland's public higher education sector. Not all private institutions are prestigious, however. Apart from particularly regulated cases, Swiss tradition has been to allow clients or the labour market itself to decide whether a private institution offers education quality rather than to leave this decision up to the State Validity of degrees issued by private institutions in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/themen/hochschulen/01641/index.html?lang=de&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDfYN_e2ym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A-- {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629002823/http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/themen/hochschulen/01641/index.html?lang=de |date=2013-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the institutional titles of university, university of applied science, university institute and university of applied science institute are protected by law and may only be used by publicly accredited institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aaq.ch/en/download/akkreditierung_alle%20/institutionelle_akkreditierung/2016-01-01_Documentation-Institutional-Accreditation_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109023933/http://aaq.ch/en/download/akkreditierung_alle%20/institutionelle_akkreditierung/2016-01-01_Documentation-Institutional-Accreditation_EN.pdf |archivedate=2017-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{see also|Bogus colleges in the United Kingdom}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] only institutions with degree awarding powers awarded by [[royal charter]] or by or under an [[act of parliament]] can grant degrees, and courses leading to UK degrees can only be offered by these institutions or institutions validated by an institution with degree awarding powers (with the exception of a small number of "recognised awards" that are specifically designated by the Secretary of State). However, it is not an offence for overseas bodies to offer their own qualifications in Britain as long as it is made clear that these are not UK degrees. A list of "recognised bodies" that have degree awarding powers, "listed bodies" that offer courses leading to degrees from recognised bodies, and "recognised awards" is maintained by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recognised-uk-degrees#bogus-degrees|title=Recognised UK degrees|at=Bogus degrees|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/check-a-university-is-officially-recognised/overview|website=Gov.uk|title=Check if a university or college is officially recognised|date=4 October 2016|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also maintains a list of educational institutions that are entitled to sponsor students for visas, although lack of inclusion on this list does not necessarily imply that an institution is 'bogus', merely that they are not licensed to sponsor students for visas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-students|title=Register of licensed sponsors: students|publisher=UK Visas and Immigration|date=21 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Higher education accreditation in the United States|Diploma mills in the United States}}
Unlike in some countries, the term "college" or "university" is not legally protected in the [[United States]] on a national level; however, such terms are restricted by some states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York State Education Law Section 224|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/EDN/I/5/1/224|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York State Limited Liability Company Law Section 204|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/LLC/2/204|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal government does not accredit any institutions or programs, either inside or outside of the United States.  Instead, it maintains a list of valid, reliable, independent accrediting agencies, including private organizations and, for vocational schools, state accrediting agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation.html#Overview Accreditation in the United States:  Overview of Accreditation] [[U.S. Department of Education]]. (25 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  The agency maintains a complete list of accredited institutions and programs online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation/Search.aspx The Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716094916/http://www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation/Search.aspx |date=2009-07-16 }} U.S. Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[U.S. state|state]]s require degree-issuing higher education institutions to obtain a basic [[business license]]—the same simple paperwork required of any business, such as a [[day care center]] or a [[grocery store]]—and to register with the state or to have other formal authorization in order to enroll students or issue degrees; however, these legal authorizations are not the same as educational accreditation.  Some U.S. state laws allow authorities to shut down illegal operations of unaccredited schools or [[diploma mill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Diploma Witness Won’t Talk", ''Los Angeles Mirror News'', October 23, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;  In others, particularly, Idaho, Hawaii, Montana, and California, the state permits anyone to claim to operate a college and issue degrees with essentially no oversight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonstudentaid.gov/oog-diploma-mills.aspx Diploma Mills] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408230537/http://www.oregonstudentaid.gov/oog-diploma-mills.aspx |date=2015-04-08 }}.  Office of Degree Authorization, Oregon.  Quotation:  "Some states have lax standards that allow almost anyone to operate a “college”...Idaho, Hawaii, Montana, and California have either no meaningful standards, excessive loopholes or poor enforcement owing to local policy or insufficient staff."{{404|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in 21 jurisdictions, unaccredited religious degree-granting schools are exempted from government oversight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/religious_exempt.aspx Oregon Student Assistance Commission Office of Degree Authorization (ODA): Religious Exempt Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221105944/http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/religious_exempt.aspx |date=2011-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students studying at an unaccredited institution are never eligible for [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]], including [[student loan]]s, through any government agency. It is legal for the school itself or other private entities to offer financial assistance to students. 

Some unaccredited institutions and programs provide significant, legitimate academic work.&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;[http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/diploma_mill.html Diploma Mills].  Office of Degree Authorization, Oregon.  Quotation:  "“Mail drop” degree mills are simply fraud, a way for unscrupulous hucksters to make money while providing no service. More substantive degree mills devalue college degrees by making them available without college-level work. This makes all degrees suspect and confuses employers and professional licensing boards that need to know whether a person has an appropriate educational background....Not all unaccredited colleges are necessarily degree mills in the traditional sense of the term.

The '''University of Dar es Salaam''' ('''UDSM''') is a [[public university]] in [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.tcu.go.tz/images/pdf/Recognised_Universities_Colleges_Centres.pdf | title= Register of Universities | format= [[PDF]] | publisher= [[Tanzania Commission for Universities]] | accessdate= 15 July 2013 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924113511/http://www.tcu.go.tz/images/pdf/Recognised_Universities_Colleges_Centres.pdf | archivedate= 24 September 2015 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1961 as an affiliate college of the [[University of London]]. The university became an affiliate of the [[University of East Africa]] (UEA) in 1963, shortly after Tanzania gained its independence from the United Kingdom. In 1970, UEA split into three independent universities: [[Makerere University]] in [[Uganda]], the [[University of Nairobi]] in [[Kenya]], and the University of Dar es Salaam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.udsm.ac.tz/about_us/index.php |title=Welcome to the University of Dar es Salaam - Background |publisher=University of Dar es Salaam |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921212526/http://udsm.ac.tz/about_us/index.php |archive-date=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rankings==

In 2012, the University Ranking by Academic Performance Center ranked the University of Dar es Salaam as the 1,618th best university in the world (out of 2,000 ranked universities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urapcenter.org/2012/university.php?q=University+of+Dar+Es+Salaam|title=URAP - University Ranking by Academic Performance|work=urapcenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, AcademyRank ranked the university as the 2,965th best university worldwide (out of 9,803 ranked universities) but the best of the 16 ranked in Tanzania, with the [[Sokoine University of Agriculture]] in second place.

In 2012, the Scimago Institutions Rankings placed the university in 3,021st place worldwide (out of 3,290 ranked institutions), 57th in Africa, and second in Tanzania behind the [[Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences]]. This ranking is based on the total number of documents published in scholarly journals indexed in the [[Scopus]] database by [[Elsevier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scimagoir.com/pdf/sir_2012_world_report.pdf |title=SIR World Report 2012: World Ranking |publisher=Scimago Institutions Rankings |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306021337/http://scimagoir.com/pdf/sir_2012_world_report.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based solely on the university's "excellence rate", the university was ranked 16th out of 62 universities in Africa in 2011. This rate "indicates which percentage of an institution's scientific output is included into the set formed by the 10% of the most cited papers in their respective scientific fields. It is a measure of high quality output of research institutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scimagoir.com/pdf/sir_2011_world_report_africa.pdf |title=SIR World Report 2011:: Africa Supplement |publisher=Scimago Institutions Rankings |year=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306021855/http://scimagoir.com/pdf/sir_2011_world_report_africa.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VIVO''' is a web-based, [[open-source software|open-source]] suite of computer software for managing data about researchers, scientists, and faculty members. VIVO uses [[Semantic Web]] techniques to represent people and their work. As of 2017, it is used by several universities and the [[United States Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VIVO|url=http://www.vivoweb.org/|website=vivoweb.org|accessdate=23 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Cornell University]] Library originally created VIVO in 2003 as a "virtual [[List of life sciences|life sciences]] community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Devare|first1=Medha|last2=Corson-Rikert|first2=Jon|last3=Caruso|first3=Brian|last4=Lowe|first4=Brian|last5=Chiang|first5=Kathy|last6=McCue|first6=Janet|title=VIVO: Connecting People, Creating a Virtual Life Sciences Community|journal=D-Lib|date=2007|volume=13|issue=7/8|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july07/devare/07devare.html|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the National Institutes of Health awarded a $12.2 million grant to Cornell, [[University of Florida]], [[Indiana University]], [[Ponce Health Sciences University|Ponce School of Medicine]], [[Scripps Research Institute|The Scripps Research Institute]], [[Washington University]], and [[Weill Cornell Medicine|Weill Cornell Medical College]] to expand the tool for use outside of Cornell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=García-Milian|first1=Rolando|last2=Norton|first2=Hannah F.|last3=Auten|first3=Beth|last4=Davis|first4=Valrie I.|last5=Holmes|first5=Kristi L.|last6=Johnson|first6=Margeaux|last7=Tennant|first7=Michele R.|title=Librarians as Part of Cross-Disciplinary, Multi-institutional Team Projects: Experiences from the VIVO Collaboration|journal=Science &amp; Technology Libraries|date=April 2013|volume=32|issue=2|pages=160–175|doi=10.1080/0194262X.2013.791183|pmc=3700548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data ingest==
VIVO can harvest publication data from [[PubMed]], CSV files, relational databases, or [[OAI-PMH]] harvest.  It then uses a semi-automated process to match publications to researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Chris|last2=Williams|first2=Stephen|last3=Sposato|first3=Vincent|last4=Skaggs|first4=Nicholas|last5=Raum|first5=Narayan|last6=Corson-Rikert|first6=Jon|last7=Caruso|first7=Brian|last8=Blake|first8=Jim|editor1-last=Börner|editor1-first=Katy|editor2-last=Conlon|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Corson-Rikert|editor3-first=Jon|editor4-last=Ding|editor4-first=Ying|title=VIVO : a semantic approach to scholarly networking and discovery|date=2012|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool|location=[San Rafael, Calif.]|isbn=9781608459933|chapter=Extending VIVO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also harvests information about researchers from Human Resources systems and [[Student information system|student information systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About VIVO|url=http://vivoweb.org/info/about-vivo|website=vivoweb.org|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ontology==
The VIVO ontology incorporates elements of several established ontologies, including [[Dublin Core]], [[Bibliographic Ontology]], [[FOAF (ontology)|FOAF]], and [[Simple Knowledge Organization System|SKOS]]. The ontology can be used to describe several [[Professor#Tasks|roles of faculty members]], including research, teaching, and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Ding|first1=Ying|last2=Mitchell|first2=Stella|last3=Corson-Rikert|first3=Jon|last4=Lowe|first4=Brian|last5=He|first5=Bing|title=The VIVO Ontology: Enabling Networking of Scientists|date=2011|url=http://www.websci11.org/fileadmin/websci/Posters/170_paper.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch [[Data Archiving and Networked Services]] and [[Indiana University]] worked to develop the ontology to enable bilingual modeling of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambers|first1=Tamy|last2=Shah|first2=Sahil|last3=Urankar|first3=Ashish|last4=Kalyan|first4=Venkat|last5=Scharnhorst|first5=Andrea|last6=Reijnhoudt|first6=Linda|last7=Rideour|first7=Laura|last8=Guéret|first8=Christophe|last9=Ding|first9=Ying|title=Bilingual researcher profiles: Modeling Dutch researchers in both English and Dutch using the VIVO ontology|journal=Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=2013|volume=50|issue=1|pages=1–4|doi=10.1002/meet.14505001137}}&lt;/ref&gt;
