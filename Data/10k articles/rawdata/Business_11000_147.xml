'''Aaron Fish''' is an entertainment producer and technology creator who lives in Vancouver, BC, Canada, where he serves as President and CEO of Dreams One Entertainment Corporation and Accordios Worldwide Enterprises Inc.

==Early career==
Aaron Fish demonstrated an affinity for music and entertainment production at an early age when he acted as deejay for his elementary and high school graduations.&lt;ref name=art1&gt;''The Georgia Straight'', 30 October  &amp;ndash; 6 November 1987, Dave Watson, "Eran is hardly a Fish out of water"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, at the age of 19, he was hired by Vancouver-based [[CFOX-FM| CFOX-FM (99.3 The Fox)]] where, among other duties, he went on to engineer [[Terry David Mulligan| Terry David Mulligan's]] CKLG morning show.&lt;ref name=art1 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Aaron Fish (producer) with Terry David Mulligan and Bryan Adams.jpg|thumb|right|Aaron Fish (center) with then-colleague [[Terry David Mulligan]] (Canadian actor and radio and television personality) and [[Bryan Adams]] (Canadian singer, musician, producer, actor, social activist, and photographer) in the mid-80s]] --&gt;

A turning point in his career began when he started an annual tradition of producing a boat cruise experience for 200 of his high school friends. The successful series of produced events&lt;ref name=art2&gt;''The Province'', 30 April 1987, Tom Harrison, "Louie Louie Is Packing 'Em In"&lt;/ref&gt; led Fish to branch out into various forms of packaged entertainment properties and corporate sponsorship vehicles.&lt;ref name=art1 /&gt;

==Middle career==
In the 80s, Fish expanded his music industry experience, working as a deejay and entertainment coordinator at the 86 Street Music Hall built for the [[Expo 86|1986 World's Fair]] while simultaneously packaging and producing theme parties that sold out from the early to late 80s.&lt;ref name=art2 /&gt; During this time, he started SixStar Attractions Inc. and Fish Entertainment under which he created and produced various entertainment events.

Throughout the 80s, Fish's entertainment vehicles grew in scope and drawing power through sponsorship integration, such as a draw prize for a $13,000 trip for two to 12 countries around the world.&lt;ref name=art1 /&gt;

By 1991, his first of multiple Party 2000 Gala events, inspired by New York-style cabarets, featured a dance floor large enough for 2,000 participants on New Year's Eve.&lt;ref name=art3&gt;''The Province'', 28 December 1994, John Bermingham, "6,000 expected at gigantic bash"&lt;/ref&gt; The Party 2000 series, which successfully drew between 5,000 and 6,000 participants, also grew in scale each year, with the 1994 event including a million-dollar light-and-sound show, a simultaneous broadcast on [[CKZZ-FM|Z 95.3 FM (now CKZZ Virgin Radio 95.3 FM)]], and a one-hour live TV special on the then active U.TV network.&lt;ref name=art3 /&gt;

==Sponsorship integration==
Fish continued to experiment with both his productions and his sponsor integration model throughout the late 90s in preparation for his Millennium New Year's Eve party, dubbed BMW Party 2000. The production was an executive black tie event, selling out 2,800 tickets by mid-October and filling every room in the [[Hyatt Regency]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Vancouver Sun'', 1 January 2000, Charles Campbell, "Simpler Celebrations Usher In New Year"&lt;/ref&gt;

The BMW Party 2000 also integrated brand marketing from 15 corporate sponsors including [[BMW| BMW Group Canada Inc.]], [[The Province| The Province newspaper]] (a [[Canwest|CanWest Global Communications Corp.]] company), and the [[Hyatt Regency]], with sponsor advertising integrated across all media platforms and displayed throughout the venue, utilizing a marketing methodology similar to that used to fund sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;''The Vancouver Sun'', 22 December 1999, "New Year's extravaganzas fizzle"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current career==
In the 2000s, Fish started Modern Business Discovery Corporation under which he ran his first series of Internet-based events, the Million Dollar Dream Contest, in 2003. A second Dream Contest followed in 2004 with the two productions collectively drawing sponsors including [[Global Television Network]] (a [[Canwest|CanWest Global Communications Corp.]] company), [[Ford motor company of canada|Ford Motor Company of Canada]], [[BMW| BMW Group Canada Inc.]], and [[The Province| The Province newspaper]] (a [[Canwest|CanWest Global Communications Corp.]] company).

In July 2008, Fish submitted a provisional patent in the United States for a new Digital Marketing and Revenue Generation system, followed by an international patent filing on July 17, 2009 with the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), and then, in 2010 and 2011, multiple national patent filings in the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom/Europe.

Fish is currently developing and producing various online and mobile sports, music and entertainment marketing properties as President and CEO of Dreams One Entertainment Co. and Accordios Worldwide Enterprises Inc.

'''Abdulrahman Ben Yezza''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الرحمن عبدالله بن يزة}}) is a [[Libya]]n businessman and politician who is the Oil Minister in the government of [[Abdurrahim El-Keib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=TD Waterhouse|url=https://research.tdwaterhouse.ca/research/public/Markets/NewsArticle/1314-L5E7MM3CW-1|date=22 November 2011|accessdate=22 November 2011|title=NTC spokesman confirms Zintan commander as defence min|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522155459/https://research.tdwaterhouse.ca/research/public/Markets/NewsArticle/1314-L5E7MM3CW-1|archive-date=2012-05-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2011 [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], Ben Yezza served as "chairman of the operator's management committee" for [[Italy|Italian]] oil company [[Eni]]. He also worked for Libya's [[National Oil Corporation]] during [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya's governance]] by [[Muammar Gaddafi]], but he quit the company voluntarily due to reported differences with its then-leader [[Shokri Ghanem]], a member of Gaddafi's inner circle.&lt;ref name="sweet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abndigital.com/page/news/top-business-stories/1035860-Libya-proposes-ex-Eni-executive-for-oil-minister |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126210246/http://www.abndigital.com/page/news/top-business-stories/1035860-Libya-proposes-ex-Eni-executive-for-oil-minister |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 November 2011 |work=ABN Digital |title=Libya proposes ex-Eni executive for oil minister |accessdate=22 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Libyan government has named Abdulrahman Ben Yezza as chairman of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA). He temporarily replaced AmbdulMagid Breish who had to step out pending investigation into his role in the Gaddafi administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ben Yezza, an ally of Jibril, to head LIA|url=http://www.africaintelligence.com/MCE/businessmen/2014/07/10/ben-yezza-an-ally-of-jibril-to-head-lia,108030513-BRC|publisher=Africa Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Ben Yezza was originally considered for an appointment to government under the interim administration of [[Mahmoud Jibril]], the [[National Transitional Council]]'s prime minister during the fight to overthrow Gaddafi. Jibril's overt contemplation of naming Ben Yezza, who was ultimately passed over in favor of retaining Deputy Prime Minister [[Ali Tarhouni]], to head the Oil Ministry was seen by some analysts as a gesture to the [[government of Italy]], a major investor in Libyan oilfields and an important supporter of the Libyan civil war.&lt;ref name="sweet"/&gt; Ben Yezza was ultimately given the portfolio of Oil Minister by Jibril's successor, [[Abdurrahim El-Keib]], on 22 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/11/20111122182321109582.html|work=Al Jazeera|date=22 November 2011|accessdate=22 November 2011|title=Libya's NTC announces new cabinet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agile Business Intelligence''' (BI) refers to the use of [[Agile software development]] for [[Business intelligence|BI]] projects to reduce the time it takes for traditional BI to show value to the organization, and to help in quickly adapting to changing business needs. Agile BI enables the BI team and managers to make better business decisions, and to start doing this more quickly.

==Agile BI==
'''Agile Business Intelligence (BI)''' refers to the use of the agile software development methodology for BI projects&lt;ref name="Enabling Agile Business Intelligence"&gt;{{cite web |title=Enabling Agile Business Intelligence with Balanced Insight Consensus |url=http://www.balancedinsight.com/wp-content/files/BIWhitepaper_EnablingAgileBI.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce the time-to-value of traditional BI and helps in quickly adapting to changing business needs.&lt;ref name="What is Agile BI"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Agile BI |url=http://www.nathean.com/index.php/what-is-agile-bi/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agile BI enables the BI team and managers to make better business decisions.  Agile methodology works on the iterative principle; this provides the new features of software to the end users sooner than the traditional waterfall process which delivers only the final product.  With Agile the requirements and design phases overlap with development, thus reducing the development cycles for faster delivery.  It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed iterative approach, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agile software development]]&lt;/ref&gt; Agile BI encourages business users and IT professionals to think about their data differently and it characterized by low Total Cost of Change (TCC).{{r|What is Agile BI}}  With agile BI, the focus is not on solving every BI problem at once but rather on delivering pieces of BI functionality in manageable chunks via shorter development cycles and documenting each cycle as it happens.&lt;ref&gt;DeSarra, Paul.  "BI Dashboards the Agile Way", BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE Journal • vol. 17, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Many companies fail to deliver right information to the right business managers at the right time.&lt;ref name="Three Steps to Analytic Heaven"&gt;White, David. "Agile BI – Three Steps to Analytic Heaven", April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
Agile BI is a continual process and not a onetime implementation.  Managers and leaders need accurate and quick information about the company and business intelligence provides the data they need.  Agile BI enables rapid development using the agile methodology.  Agile techniques are a great way to promote development of BI applications, such as dashboards, scorecards, reports and analytic applications.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Rick. "How to leverage agile BI to help your BI architecture", January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

"Forrester Research defines agile BI as an approach that combines processes, methodologies, tools and technologies, while incorporating organizational structure, in order to help strategic, tactical and operational decision-makers be more flexible and more responsive to ever-changing business and regulatory requirements".&lt;ref name="Getting a fast start with agile BI development" &gt;Violino, Bob. "Getting a fast start with agile BI development", ComputerWorld, Nov 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the research by the Aberdeen Group, organizations with the most highly agile BI implementations are more likely to have processes in place for ensuring that business needs are being met.{{r|Getting a fast start with agile BI development}}  Success of Agile BI implementation also heavily depends on the end user participation and "frequent collaboration between IT and the business".{{r|Getting a fast start with agile BI development}}

==Key Performance Criteria==
Aberdeen’s Maturity Class Framework{{r|Three Steps to Analytic Heaven}} uses three key performance criteria to distinguish the Best-in-class in the industry:

# '''Availability of timely management information''' – IT should be able to provide the right and accurate information in timely manner to the business managers to make sound business decisions.  “This performance metric captures the frequency with which business users receive their information they need in the timeframe they need it”{{r|Three Steps to Analytic Heaven}}.
# '''Average time required to add a column to an existing report''' – Sometimes new columns need to be added to an existing report to see the required information.  "If that information cannot be obtained within the time required to support the decision at hand, the information has no material value.  This metric measure the total elapsed time required to modify an existing report by adding a column"{{r|Three Steps to Analytic Heaven}}.
# '''Average time required to create a new dashboard''' – This metric considers the time required to access any new or updated information and it measures the total elapsed time required to create a new dashboard{{r|Three Steps to Analytic Heaven}}.

==The Agile SDLC==
[http://www.agiledata.org/essays/dataWarehousingBestPractices.html Agile SDLC Iterative Process]

==Five Steps To Agile BI==
Bruni&lt;ref name="5 Steps To Agile BI" /&gt;  in her article '''5 Steps To Agile BI''' outlines the five elements that promote an Agile BI enterprise environment.

# '''Agile Development Methodology''' – “need for an agile, iterative process that speeds the time to market of BI requests by shortening development cycles”.&lt;ref name="5 Steps To Agile BI"&gt;Bruni, Margherita. "5 Steps To Agile BI", Informationweek.com, June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Agile Project Management Methodology''' – continuous planning and execution.  Planning is done at the beginning of each cycle, rather than one time at the beginning of the project as in traditional projects.  In Agile project, scope can be changed any time during the development phase.
# '''Agile Infrastructure''' – the system should have virtualization and horizontal scaling capability.  This gives flexibility to easily modify the infrastructure and could also maintain near-real-time BI more easily than the standard [[Extract, transform, load]] (ETL) model{{r|5 Steps To Agile BI}}.
# '''Cloud &amp; Agile BI''' – Many organizations are implementing cloud technology now as it is the cheaper alternative to store and transfer data.  Companies who are in their initial stages of implementing Agile BI should consider the Cloud technology as cloud services can now support BI and ETL software to be provisioned in the cloud{{r|5 Steps To Agile BI}}.
# '''IT Organization &amp; Agile BI''' – To achieve agility and maximum effectiveness, the IT team should interact with the business, but also address the business problems and should have a strong and cohesive team{{r|5 Steps To Agile BI}}.

==Twelve Agile Principles==
There are 12 Agile Principles (Manifesto) [http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html Agile Manifesto] grouped as Process, People, and Other.

===Process===
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.&lt;ref name="Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse"&gt;"Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse"&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse" /&gt;

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.&lt;ref name="Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse" /&gt;

4. Working software is the primary measure of progress.&lt;ref name="Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse" /&gt;

===People===
5. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

6. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}.

7. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

===Other===
8. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face conversation.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

9. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

10. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

11. Simplicity-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-is essential.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

12. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

==BI model and its characteristic goals==
Kernochan, in his two-year study of organization’s BI process came up with the below model and its characteristic goals:{{r|What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means}}
# Data entry — accuracy  
# Data consolidation — consistency  
# Data aggregation — scope  
# Information targeting — fit  
# Information delivery — timeliness  
# Information analysis — analyzability

===Common Issues===
Kernochan’s study found these common issues with the current BI processes:{{r|What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means}}
* 20% of data has error in it (accuracy)  
* 50% of data is inconsistent (consistency)  
* It typically takes 7 days to get data to the end user (timeliness)  
* It isn't possible to do a cross-database query on 70% of company data (scope)  
* 65% of the time, executives don't receive the data they need (fit)  
* 60% of the time, users can't do immediate online analysis of data they receive (analyzability)  
* 75% of new key information sources that surface on the Web are not passed on to users within the year (agility) 
The result concluded that the adding of agility to existing business intelligence will minimize problems. 
Organizations are slowly trying to move the entire organization processes to agile methodology and development.  Agile BI will play a big part in company’s success as it "emphasizes integration with agile development and innovation".{{r|What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means}}

==Improving Business Intelligence Agility==
There are couple of factors that influence the success of Business Intelligence Agility.

===Data Entry===
20% of data is inaccurate and about 50% is inconsistent and these numbers increases with new type of data.  Processes need to be re-evaluated and corrected to minimize data entry errors.&lt;ref name="What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kernochan, Wayne. "What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means", IT Business Edge, April 7, 2011 |url=http://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/business-intelligence/what-agile-business-intelligence-really-means-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data Consolidation===
Often companies have multiple data stores and data is scattered across multiple data stores.  "Agility theory emphasizes auto-discovery of each new data source, and automated upgrade of metadata repositories to automatically accommodate the new information".{{r|What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means}}

===Data Aggregation===
Is a process in which information from many data stores is pulled and displayed in a summary report. [[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP) is a simple type of data aggregation tools which is commonly used.

===Information Delivery===
One of the key principal of Agile BI is to deliver the right data at the right time to the right individual.  Historical data should also be maintained for comparing the current performance with the past.{{r|What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means}}

===Information Analysis===
One of the largest benefits of Agile BI is in improving the decision-making of its users.  Real Agile BI should focus on analysis tools that make an operational process or new product development better.{{r|What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means}}  The Agile BI approach will save company money, time, and resources that would otherwise be needed to build a traditional data warehouse using the Waterfall methodology.

==Agile BI Checklist==
* A team of developers and business representatives should be assembled to work together
* Select either a business stakeholder or technical liaisons to represent the business
* Identify and prioritize appropriate user stories or requirements to address during an initial project{{r|Enabling Agile Business Intelligence}}
* Assess various Agile BI delivery tools that can integrate with your existing data warehouse and BI environment{{r|Enabling Agile Business Intelligence}}
* Initiate iterative development process

==Advantages of using Agile BI==
Agile BI drives its users to self-serve BI.  It offers organizations flexibility in terms of delivery, user adoption, and ROI.

===Faster to Deliver===
Using Agile methodology, the product is delivered in shorter development cycles with multiple iterations.&lt;ref name="Making Business Intelligence Easy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Making Business Intelligence Easy |url=http://www.yellowfinbi.com/Document.i4?DocumentId=118864}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each iteration is a working software and can be deployed to production.

===Increased User Acceptance===
In an Agile development environment, IT and business work together (often in the same room) refining the business needs in each iteration.{{r|Making Business Intelligence Easy}}  "This increases user adoption by focusing on the frequently changing needs of the non-technical business user, leading to high end-user engagement, and resulting in higher user adoption rates".{{r|Making Business Intelligence Easy}}

===Increased ROI===
Organizations can achieve increased rate-of-return (ROI) due to shorter development cycles.  This minimizes the IT resources and time while delivering working, relevant reports to end-users.{{r|Making Business Intelligence Easy}}

==Agile BI Best Practices==
# A program charter should be created, which will set the stakeholder expectations on how Agile BI system will work.&lt;ref name="BI Principles for Agile Development"&gt;Larson, Deanne.  "BI Principles for Agile Development", Business Intelligence Journal, Volume 14, Number 4, Pg 41, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert J. Meyer''' is a forensic accountant and investor who is credited with uncovering fraud at the [[Foundation for New Era Philanthropy]], one of the largest ponzi schemes in U.S. history, as well as notable accounting irregularities at several large public companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stecklow|first1=Steve|title=A Big Charity Faces Questions About Its Financing From SEC|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB843846715223020000|accessdate=25 October 2017|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 28, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium''' (originally named the '''Departmental Auditorium''') is a 750-seat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mellonauditorium.com/capacity.htm |title=AWMA Capacities |publisher=Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium |accessdate=2011-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903024148/http://www.mellonauditorium.com/capacity.htm |archivedate=2011-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; historic [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] [[auditorium]] located at 1301 [[Constitution Avenue]] NW in [[Washington, D.C.]] The auditorium, which connects two wings of the [[William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building]], is owned by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] but available for use by the public.

==Description==
[[San Francisco]]-based American [[architect]] [[Arthur Brown, Jr.]] designed the auditorium as well as the two buildings adjacent to it.&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt; The architectural style of the building is Neoclassical,&lt;ref name="Applewhite"&gt;Applewhite, E.J. ''Washington Itself: An Informal Guide to the Capital of the United States.'' New York: Knopf, 1981. {{ISBN|0-394-74875-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are all the buildings in the [[Federal Triangle]] development.&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bednar" /&gt; The [[portico]] of the Auditorium provides the motif for the both buildings which are on either side of it.&lt;ref name="Goode"&gt;Goode, James M. ''The Outdoor Sculpture of Washington, D.C.: A Comprehensive Historical Guide.'' Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1974. {{ISBN|0-87474-138-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six [[Doric order|Doric]] columns form the auditorium's portico.&lt;ref name="Applewhite" /&gt; Over the portico is a [[pediment]] titled "Columbia", by Edgar Walter.&lt;ref name="Goode" /&gt; The sculpture on the pediment depicts [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] (the feminine personification of the [[United States]]) seated on a throne-like chair, an eagle on her right, a nude youth on her left, and the rays of the sun spreading out behind her.&lt;ref name="Goode" /&gt; Behind the portico, a second pediment sits over an archway which leads to the [[colonnade]]. This sculpture, by [[Edmond Romulus Amateis]], depicts [[George Washington]] at the [[Battle of Trenton]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovason, David. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HJNqynmJtF0C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''The Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capital: The Masons and the Building of Washington.''] Reprint ed. New York: HarperCollins, 2002. {{ISBN|0-06-095368-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior is in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Wurman, Richard Saul. ''Washington, DC Access.'' 3d ed. New York: Access Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-06-277039-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior lighting was designed by Brown, and consists of brass and aluminum chandeliers overhead and aluminum and gold leaf bracket lamps on the walls.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, Sally Kress and Boucher, Jack E. ''A Quest for Grandeur: Charles Moore and the Federal Triangle.'' Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1993. {{ISBN|1-56098-161-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceiling was originally painted blue.&lt;ref&gt;Look, David W. and Perrault, Carole L. ''The Interior Building: Its Architecture and Its Ar.'' Washington, D.C.: National Park Service, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonnades link the auditorium to the buildings to the east and west, and [[Long gallery|galleries]] in the Auditorium's rear provide interior passages to these buildings as well.  The galleries have received much praise. One critic noted, "The open galleries linking the auditorium to its neighbors constitute one of the greatest passages in American architecture."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Richard Guy. "Arthur Brown, Jr., California Classicist." ''Progressive architecture.'' December 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire structure has been called "one of the most magnificent auditoriums in the country."&lt;ref&gt;Goode, James M. ''The Outdoor Sculpture of Washington, D.C.: A Comprehensive Historical Guide.'' Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1974, p. 168. {{ISBN|0-87474-138-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The building was constructed as part of the [[Federal Triangle]] development.&lt;ref name="Worthy"&gt;Gutheim, Frederick Albert and Lee, Antoinette Josephine. ''Worthy of the Nation: Washington, DC, From L'Enfant to the National Capital Planning Commission.'' 2d ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8018-8328-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bednar"&gt;Bednar, Michael J. ''L'Enfant's Legacy: Public Open Spaces in Washington.'' Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8018-8318-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although plans to redevelop the [[slum]] [[Murder Bay]] had existed for decades, Congress did not fund the purchase of land or construction of buildings in the area until 1926.&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bednar" /&gt; In July 1926, the government proposed building a [[Department of Labor Building]] between 13th and 14th Streets NW on the north side of B Street NW (now Constitution Avenue NW).&lt;ref name="FourSites"&gt;"4 Sites Selected for U.S. Buildings in Local Program." ''Washington Post.'' July 8, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1927, the government proposed adding a second building to the east (between 12th and 13th Streets NW) for "Independent Offices" (the building's purpose was later changed to be the headquarters of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]], or ICC).&lt;ref name="Whitaker"&gt;Whitaker, Charles B. "Building for the Glory of Washington." ''New York Times.'' March 6, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; Design work proceeded slowly.&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bednar" /&gt; In April 1930, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]] proposed building a $2 million "Departmental Auditorium" to connect the Labor and ICC buildings.&lt;ref&gt;"Hoover Urges Funds For Six New Buildings." ''Washington Post.'' April 23, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aerial view of National Museum of American History.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium, among other buildings, in the [[Federal Triangle]].  The [[National Museum of American History]] is in the foreground.]]
President Hoover laid the cornerstones for the Labor/ICC building on December 15, 1932.&lt;ref name="HooverLaysLabor"&gt;"Hoover Lays Stone of Labor Building." ''New York Times.'' December 16, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] trained in [[masonry]] assisted the President in laying the cornerstones.&lt;ref name="HooverLaysLabor" /&gt; Hoover personally oversaw the dedication of the cornerstone at the Labor end of the building. His words were broadcast over loudspeaker to the workers at the ICC end of the structure, who placed the ICC cornerstone simultaneously at the President's instruction (becoming the first time in Washington history that a single person dedicated two cornerstones at the same time).&lt;ref name="HooverLaysLabor" /&gt; [[William Green (labor leader)|William Green]], President of the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), attended the laying of the cornerstone for the Labor building.&lt;ref name="HooverLaysLabor" /&gt;

The Labor/ICC building and Departmental Auditorium were dedicated on February 25, 1935.&lt;ref name="LaborEdifice"&gt;"Capital Dedicates New Labor Edifice." ''New York Times.'' February 26, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] [[Frances Perkins]] dedicated the $4.5 million Labor building at a ceremony attended by AFL President Green.&lt;ref name="LaborEdifice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WorkICC"&gt;"Work On New I.C.C. Structure Nearing." ''Washington Post.'' April 21, 1931; "Firm Here Enters Low Bid on Razing." ''Washington Post.'' May 21, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; The ICC portion of the structure cost $4.45 million.&lt;ref name="AtLast"&gt;"Capitol Triangle At Last Completed." ''Associated Press.'' August 4, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; The dedications occurred in the Auditorium, and constituted the first event ever held there.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:NATO Summit in Washington 1999.jpg|thumb|The [[North Atlantic Council]] convening in the Mellon Auditorium in 1999.]]
Several important events in American and world history have occurred in the Mellon Auditorium.  President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] announced the re-institution of [[conscription]] in 1940 from the Auditorium stage.&lt;ref&gt;"Stimson Will Draw First Number In Draft Lottery at Noon Oct. 29." ''New York Times.'' October 22, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The signing of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] that established [[NATO]] occurred in the Auditorium on April 4, 1949.&lt;ref&gt;"Russians May See Signing Of the Pact if They Wish."

Besides advocating for greater safety, comfort, and convenience for bicyclists, many members of the industry promote bicycles for [[Poverty reduction|poverty alleviation]]. Experiments done in Africa ([[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]]) and [[Sri Lanka]] on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3-10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.

[[World Bicycle Relief]], which specializes in large-scale, comprehensive bicycle distribution programs to aid poverty relief and disaster recovery initiatives in developing countries around the world, includes among its sponsors such notable companies as [[Accell Group]], [[Bicycle Technologies International]], [[Giant Bicycles]], [[GT Bicycles]], [[Quality Bicycle Products]], [[Shimano]], [[SRAM Corporation]], [[Specialized Bicycle Components]], and [[Trek Bicycle Corporation]].

==Biography==
{{moresources|section|date=August 2017}}
Born in 1943 in Ayer, Massachusetts, Aucoin attended [[Northeastern University]] and graduated with a degree in film.&lt;ref name="aucoin.biz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aucoin.biz/au_pages/about.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704124202/http://www.aucoin.biz/au_pages/about.php |archivedate=2010-07-04 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; He worked at [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] in [[Boston]] during his college years and after. Aucoin later worked at Teletape Productions as a cinematographer.&lt;ref name="aucoin.biz"/&gt; Credited with discovering [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], Aucoin managed the group for nearly a decade. He was fired in 1982 due to a dispute about the band's appearance plus his drug abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/23/business/the-bad-boys-start-watching-their-pockets.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=The Bad Boys Start Watching Their Pockets|first=Geraldine|last=Fabrikant|date=1997-02-23|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later worked with the band on various [[DVD]] projects.

Aucoin produced a television show called ''[[Supermarket Sweep]]'' in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1568719/|title=Bill Aucoin|website=IMDb|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 to 2007, Aucoin went into the Broadway business with a staging of [[The Who]]'s ''[[Quadrophenia (musical)|Quadrophenia]]'', which showed intermittently for two years in [[Anaheim]] and [[Los Angeles]]. 

Aucoin had reentered the management business with his company Aucoin Globe Entertainment, at the time of his death of surgical complications from [[prostate cancer]]. He was survived by partner Roman Fernandez and sisters Betty Britton and Janet Bankowski. A statement from [[Paul Stanley]] and [[Gene Simmons]] described him as "our irreplaceable original manager, mentor and dear friend… Words cannot convey his impact on us or those close to him."&lt;ref&gt;Ling, Dave, "The Dirt: Bill Aucoin"; ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' #148, August 2010, p20&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''breaker boy''' was a coal-mining worker in the [[United States]]&lt;ref name="Hindman"&gt;Hindman, Hugh D. ''Child Labor: An American History.'' Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7656-0936-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United Kingdom]] whose job was to separate impurities from [[coal]] by hand in a [[coal breaker]]. Although breaker boys were primarily children, elderly coal miners who could no longer work in the mines because of age, disease, or accident were also sometimes employed as breaker boys.&lt;ref&gt;This gave rise to a saying among coal miners: "Once an adult, twice a boy." See: Miller, Donald L. and Sharpless, Richard E. ''The Kingdom of Coal: Work, Enterprise, and Ethnic Communities in the Mine Fields.'' State College, Pa.: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0-8122-7991-3}}; McDowell, John. "The Life of a Coal Miner." In ''The World's Work...: A History of Our Time.'' Vol. 4.

Mount Pleasant, S.C.: Arcadia Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7385-0978-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of breaker boys began in the mid-1860s.&lt;ref name="Derickson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Textbook" /&gt; Although public disapproval of the employment of children as breaker boys existed by the mid-1880s, the practice did not end until the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Hindman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;

==Coal breaking==
[[File:Charles Green06.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;"Breaker boy"&lt;br /&gt;by [[Charles Green (painter)|Charles Green]]]]
Coal came into wide use in late 1590s in the United Kingdom after the island nation was widely deforested and a ban was placed on the harvesting of wood by [[Charles I of England]] so that forests could be used solely by the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name="Connections"&gt;Burke, James. ''Connections.'' New York: Little, Brown and Company, 1978, {{ISBN|0-316-11685-8}}. p. 163-170.&lt;/ref&gt; A newly emergent [[middle class]] increasingly demanded [[glass]] for windows, and the glass-making industry relied heavily on [[charcoal]] for fuel. With charcoal no longer available, this industry turned to coal. Demand for coal also increased after the invention of the [[reverbatory furnace]] and the development of methods for casting iron objects such as cannons.&lt;ref name="Connections"/&gt;

The first function of a coal breaker is to break coal into pieces and sort these pieces into categories of nearly uniform size, a process known as breaking.&lt;ref name="Ketchum"&gt;Ketchum, Milo Smith. ''The Design of Mine Structures.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; But coal is often mixed with impurities such as rock, [[slate]], [[sulphur]], ash (or "bone"), [[clay]], or soil.&lt;ref name="Ketchum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ash are impurities such as [[alumina]], [[iron]], [[silica]], and other noncombustible materials. See: [http://www.photius.com/energy/ "Ash." ''Dictionary of Energy.'' June 30, 2007.] Accessed 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the second function of a coal breaker is to remove as many impurities as economically desirable and technologically feasible, and then grade the coal based on the percent of impurities remaining.&lt;ref name="Ketchum" /&gt; This was not necessary when coal was used in cottage-industry grade production methods, but became necessary when economies of scale moved production into early factories with a larger workforce and those installations began producing glass and iron in greater quantities.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In the U.S. prior to 1830, very little [[bituminous coal]] was mined and the fuel of the early [[American Industrial Revolution]]&amp;mdash; [[anthracite coal]] underwent little processing before being sent to market, which was primarily iron works and smithies producing [[wrought iron]]. The miner himself would use a sledgehammer to break up large lumps of coal, then use a rake whose teeth were set two inches apart to collect the larger pieces of coal for shipment to the surface&lt;ref name="Korson"&gt;Korson, George Gershon. ''Black Rock: Mining Folklore of the Pennsylvania Dutch.'' Manchester, N.H.: Ayer Publishing, 1950. {{ISBN|0-405-10607-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; for such were easiest to pack densely in the sack-like bags that could be slung over the back, or onto a pack animal for the trip out of the mine.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
 
The smaller lumps of coal were considered non-marketable and left in the mine.&lt;ref name="Korson" /&gt; Beginning about 1830, surface processing of coal in the US began concurrent with various canal projects in Eastern Seaboard. These developments lagged behind Great Britain better matching the timing of similar developments in Continental Europe. Great Britain with its heavily deforested landscapes simply had to find economic alternatives sooner, stimulating Coal, Iron, and machine developments leading ultimately to Railroads and the infant [[industrial chemical]]s industries of the 1860s. Lumps of coal were placed on plates of perforated [[cast iron]] and "breakers" would hammer on the coal until it was in pieces small enough to fall through the holes.&lt;ref name="Korson" /&gt; A second screen caught the coal, and was shaken (by hand, animal, steam, or water power) to remove the unmarketable smaller lumps.&lt;ref name="Korson" /&gt; This "broken and screened" coal was worth much more than "broken" coal or lump coal&lt;ref name="Korson" /&gt; for the even sizes combusted with less trouble and need for tending once past the [[ignition point]].

==Use of breaker boys==
[[File:Boys picking slate from coal. packer -5 breaker.jpg|Breaker boys|thumb|right|Breaker boys in the 1880s picking slate from coal at a coal breaker in [[Pottsville, Pennsylvania]]. Photo by George Bretz, 1880s]]
Until about 1900, nearly all coal breaking facilities in the United States were labor-intensive. The removal of impurities was done by hand, usually by breaker boys between the ages of eight and 12 years old.&lt;ref name="Freedman"&gt;Freedman, Russell. ''Kids at Work: Lewis Hine and the Crusade Against Child Labor.'' Reprint ed. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1998. {{ISBN|0-395-79726-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"&gt;Batchelor, Bob. ''The 1900s.'' Santa Barbara, Calif.: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002. {{ISBN|0-313-31334-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;Clement, Ferguson and Reinier, Jacqueline S. ''Boyhood in America: An Encyclopedia. Volume 2: American Family.'' Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2001. {{ISBN|1-57607-215-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Black, Brian. ''Nature and the Environment in Nineteenth-Century American Life.'' Santa Barbara, Calif.: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. {{ISBN|0-313-33201-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of breaker boys began around 1866.&lt;ref name="Derickson"&gt;Derickson, Alan. ''Black Lung: Anatomy of a Public Health Disaster.'' Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8014-3186-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Textbook"&gt;International Textbook Company. ''International Library of Technology: A Series of Textbooks for Persons Engaged in the Engineering Professions and Trades.'' Vol. 38. Scranton, Pa.: International Textbook Co., 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; For 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal.&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pencak"&gt;Miller, Randall M. and Pencak, William. ''Pennsylvania: A History of the Commonwealth.'' State College, Pa.: Penn State Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-271-02214-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Novak"&gt;[[Michael Novak|Novak, Michael]].

''Divided Loyalties: The Public and Private Life of Labor Leader John Mitchell.'' Albany, N.Y.: SUNY Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7914-2087-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by pushing their boots into the stream of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly pick out the impurities, and then let the coal pass on to the next breaker boy for further processing.&lt;ref name="Korson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartoletti, Susan Campbell. ''Growing Up in Coal Country.'' New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1999. {{ISBN|0-395-97914-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into "clean" [[coal bin]]s.&lt;ref name="Textbook"/&gt;

The work performed by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys were forced to work without gloves so that they could better handle the slick coal.&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pencak"/&gt; The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding.&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pencak"/&gt; Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts.&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Novak"/&gt; Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears.&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Novak"/&gt; Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only at the end of the working day.&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Novak"/&gt; Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered.&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Novak"/&gt; Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and [[asthma]] and [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]] were common.&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pencak"/&gt; Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;When coal is mixed with water, a chemical reaction occurs that generates acid on the surface of the coal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, F.E. "Acid Pollution of Streams." ''Journal of the American Water Works Association.'' 1921; "Stimulation of Free Settling by Electrolysis." ''Mining and Metallurgy.'' January 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Anthony F.C. ''St. Clair, A Nineteenth-Century Coal Town's Experience With A Disaster-Prone Industry.''

==Public condemnation==
[[File:Pennsylvania breaker boys 1911.jpg|thumb|Breaker boys sort coal in an anthracite coal breaker near South [[Pittston, Pennsylvania]], 1911.]]

Public condemnation of the use of breaker boys was so widespread that in 1885 [[Pennsylvania]] enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from working in a coal breaker,&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pencak"/&gt; but the law was poorly enforced; many employers forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or other documents so their children could support the family.&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pencak"/&gt; Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly.&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt; One estimate had 20,000 breaker boys working in the state in 1880,&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt; 18,000 working in 1900,&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt; 13,133 working in 1902,&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt; and 24,000 working in 1907.&lt;ref name="Picker"&gt;"Install Mechanical Slate Pickers." ''Technical World Magazine.'' September 1906-February 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and water separators designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for breaker boys,&lt;ref name="Picker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1895/01/06/archives/a-great-and-efficient-coal-breaker-some-of-the-advantages-expected.html?sq=%22coal+breaker&amp;scp=46&amp;st=p "A Great and Efficient Coal Breaker."] ''New York Times.'' January 6, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; but adoption of the new technology was slow.&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt;

By the 1910s, the use of breaker boys was dropping because of improvements in technology, stricter child labor laws, and the enactment of [[compulsory education]] laws.&lt;ref name="Hindman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt; The practice of employing children in coal breakers largely ended by 1920 because of the efforts of the [[National Child Labor Committee]], [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[photographer]] [[Lewis Hine]], and the [[National Consumers League]], all of whom educated the public about the practice and succeeded in obtaining passage of [[Child labor laws in the United States|national child labor laws]].&lt;ref name="Hindman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, David and Wels, Susan. ''America Then &amp; Now: Great Old Photographs of America's Life and Times, and How Those Same Scenes Look Today.'' New York: HarperCollins, 1992. {{ISBN|0-06-250176-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Union activities==
Breaker boys were known for their fierce independence and rejection of adult authority.&lt;ref name="Novak" /&gt; Breaker boys often formed and joined [[trade union]]s, and precipitated a number of important strikes in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Strikes"&gt;Blatz, Perry K. ''Democratic Miners: Work and Labor Relations in the Anthracite Coal Industry, 1875-1925.'' Ithaca, N.Y.: SUNY Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7914-1819-7}}; Bartoletti, Susan Campbell. ''Kids on Strike!''

'''Bronislovas Lubys''' (8 October 1938 – 23 October 2011) was a [[Lithuania]]n entrepreneur, former [[Prime Minister of Lithuania]], signatory of the [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania]], and businessman.

Lubys was born in [[Plungė]]. He was CEO and main shareholder of the Lithuanian company [[Achema]]. As of August 2008, he was the richest Lithuanian, according to the Lithuanian magazine ''[[Veidas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=[[Veidas]] |title=Turtingiausi lietuviai |first=Giedrė |last=Putelytė |author2=Milda Augustinaitytė | url=http://www.veidas.lt/wp-content/uploads/2008_turtuoliai_23.pdf |date=9 June 2008 |volume=23|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubys died of a heart attack while riding a bicycle in [[Druskininkai]] on 23 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/mire-vienas-itakingiausiu-lietuvos-verslininku-blubys.d?id=51003389 |title=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5732">The '''Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students''' ('''BASES''') is a student group at [[Stanford University]] focusing on business and entrepreneurial activities. One of the largest student-run entrepreneurship organizations in the world, BASES' mission is to promote entrepreneurship education at Stanford University and to empower student entrepreneurs by bringing together the worlds of entrepreneurship, academia, and industry. BASES organizes the flagship 150K Challenge, Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders' Seminar, the SVI Hackspace, E-Bootcamp, and the Freshman Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-47758620100416, Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/fsb/0708/gallery.bestcolleges_undergrads.fsb/10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

BASES was founded in 1996 by a group of five Stanford engineers. The organization works in partnership with Silicon Valley's venture capitalists and law firms to provide a variety of entrepreneurial services to Stanford students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biztechday.com/2-powerful-entrepreneur-organizations-silicon-valley-san-francisco/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions==
BASES hosts two annual business plan competitions, one catering to for-profit startups (E-Challenge) and the other for [[social venture]]s (Social E-Challenge). It hosts a third, concurrent product showcase competition for product prototypes. A total of $150,000 is awarded each year in these competitions. Entirely student-managed, the competition attracts students from all programs and levels at Stanford. Teams must include at least one full-time Stanford student, but participation is not restricted to the Stanford community. Past winners include:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iitbombay.org/news/Current/iitians-bag-prize-for-social-change&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/06/0610_stanford_good_social_entrepreneurs/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Business Daily''''' was a British weekday financial news programme, shown on [[Channel 4]] between 1987 and 1992.

==History==
The programme launched on 21 September 1987 as part of Channel 4's 1987 expansion of weekday broadcast hours, following the transfer of [[ITV Schools]] programmes from ITV.  The 30-minute programme was broadcast on weekday lunchtimes, initially at 12 noon before transferring to 12.30pm in March 1988, where it would remain until the programme ended in June 1992. The programme was also shown by [[S4C]], but with a one-hour time delay.

In April 1989 the programme became part of Channel 4's new [[Breakfast television|breakfast programme]] ''[[The Channel 4 Daily]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87jNkk5WTTw News report about the forthcoming launch of The Channel 4 Daily]&lt;/ref&gt; Three bite-size editions were broadcast, each of between 6 and 8 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1rePDs7lOI Channel 4 Daily trailer, which includes a description of Business Daily's contribution to the programme]&lt;/ref&gt; the last of them forming the final segment of that day's edition of ''The Channel 4 Daily''.

In 1990, ''The Channel 4 Daily''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s broadcast hours were reduced slightly and the first breakfast edition of Business Daily became a programme in its own right, broadcasting for 8 minutes at 6.20am, prior to the start of ''The Channel 4 Daily''.

On 26 June 1992 the final lunchtime programme was broadcast. The breakfast editions continued for another three months with the final edition being broadcast on 25 September 1992, coinciding with the end of ''The Channel 4 Daily''.

==Presenters and reporters==
The programme had two main presenters during its time on air: [[Susannah Simons]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzJZ2VnhMP4 A clip of Susannah Simons presenting Business Daily in 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Damian Green]]. During their time as the main presenter, they would present on Mondays to Thursdays with one of the programme's reporters hosting the Friday edition. [[Dermot Murnaghan]] was the first presenter of the breakfast programmes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyOzhgykmqo The first half hour of the first edition of The Channel 4 Daily, including the start of the first Business Daily segment]&lt;/ref&gt; prior to him becoming one of the main presenters of ''The Channel 4 Daily''. 

The programme had its own team of reporters and contributors, including [[Mickey Clark]], who would join the presenter in the studio to provide viewers with commentary on the day's market action.

==The Business Programme==
A spin-off Sunday teatime programme was shown during the early days of the programme's time on air. It was a 45-minute programme which aired between 5.15pm and 6pm.

The '''chief governance officer''' ('''CGO''') is normally a senior vice executive reporting to the [[chief executive officer|CEO]], however in the not-for-profit sector when an organization uses [[Policy Governance]] the Chair of the Board often takes on the role of CGO, who is tasked with directing the people, business processes and systems needed to enable [[good governance]] from inside the corporation in support of the [[board of directors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.advisor.com/doc/14131 CGO On Duty. Is a Chief Governance Officer your best friend?]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some geographies the role is assumed by the [[general counsel|chief counsel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/blog/archive/000190.html What is a "Chief Governance Officer"? December 03, 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724101044/http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/blog/archive/000190.html |date=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in others by a corporate or [[company secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go2446/is_n1_v21/ai_n28679080/ Ueland, S. (1996). 'Board practices: {{sic|nolink=y|its'|reason=incorrect apostrophe}} time to name a chief governance officer.' Directors &amp; Boards, Autumn.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The role is likely to grow in prominence as [[corporate governance]] requirements - in voluntary codes or law - grow and mature. The heads of several governance-related functions may report to the CGO, including [[community relations]] / public affairs, [[corporate strategy]], [[business continuity management]], [[business performance management]], [[compliance management]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lumigent.com/executive_commentaries/189-c-suite-shoot-out-chief-compliance-officer-v-chief-governance-officer.html Capobianco, JH.(2010). 'C-Suite Shoot-Out: Chief Compliance Officer v. Chief Governance Officer.'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526030020/http://www.lumigent.com/executive_commentaries/189-c-suite-shoot-out-chief-compliance-officer-v-chief-governance-officer.html |date=May 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; / internal controls, [[corporate communication]], [[corporate philanthropy]], [[enterprise risk management]], [[ethics management]], [[internal audit]], [[investor relations]], [[legal services]], [[stakeholder management]] and [[corporate sustainability|sustainability management]]. Also, the appointment of a CGO with clout is both a signal to the market that the company takes corporate governance seriously and a way to increase the market value of a firm if, as research by [[McKinsey &amp; Co|McKinsey]] shows, investors will pay a premium for the stock of well-governed companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mkqpreview1.qdweb.net/Nonprofit/Three_surveys_on_corporate_governance_965 Coombes, P &amp; Watson, M. (2000). Three surveys on corporate governance. McKinsey Quarterly, Dec. ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724022735/http://mkqpreview1.qdweb.net/Nonprofit/Three_surveys_on_corporate_governance_965 |date=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As corporations add the necessary functions, several issues arise. First is the risk that the functions overlap, evolve into silos, create misunderstanding internally and externally and act at [[cross purposes]]. Second is the opportunity for enhanced impact through synergy between these functions. Risk managers, compliance officers and business performance managers often need to manage change in order to achieve their objectives. Without a sponsor at top management level their efforts may fail when the magnitude of resistance to change overwhelms their limited powers of influence. Third, the serial introduction of new processes may simply require more attention, time and enthusiasm than line managers can realistically offer.&lt;ref&gt;Kotter, J. (2005). Leading change. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A single phased plan for enabling good governance could mitigate the risks and preempt any wasteful expenditure. Last, the complexity of the interactions between the different functions compounded by the infancy of the new disciplines may require continuous conceptual interpretation for top management and the board.

== Governor of New Hampshire ==
Benson began running for governor of New Hampshire in 2001, promising to use technology and greater efficiency to save money in state government. Political signs appeared across the Granite State proclaiming "This is Benson Country." He was elected governor on November 5, 2002, in an open race to succeed the retiring governor, [[Jeanne Shaheen]]. In the [[political primary|primaries]], Benson spent more than $15&amp;nbsp;million—$11&amp;nbsp;million of it his own money&lt;ref&gt;Steen, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;—in an effort to defeat former State Senator [[Bruce Keough]] and former [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Gordon Humphrey]] to win the Republican nomination, making Benson's victory one of the most expensive in American history.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Greg (September 13, 2002).

While an investigation cleared Heed of any wrongdoing, it revealed improper interference by Benson's security commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Sarah (October 26, 2004).

Benson also frequently used "volunteers" in his office to do gubernatorial work, but would not say who they were or what they did.&lt;ref&gt;Barrick, Daniel (February 2, 2005).

Retrieved on February 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These were not volunteers in the sense that they were unpaid staffers volunteering their time, rather Benson paid their salaries out of his own pocket, making them volunteers in the sense that they did not draw state salaries. This move was controversial, while proponents noted that Benson was generously allowing the state to save money, critics were concerned that it would limit scrutiny of the volunteer staff. Reporters discovered that one of these "volunteers" (and former Cabletron director of operations), Angela Blaisdell, was New Hampshire's official liaison with the federal government on [[homeland security]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Josh (December 9, 2003).

Under Wiggin, the DES had fined Benson in 1998 and 2003 for excavating beach sand without a permit at his [[Rye, New Hampshire|Rye]] oceanfront home.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Meredith; David Rattigan &amp; Clare Kittredge (April 15, 2004).

Benson was also criticized, by both supporters and critics, for a management style that was considered "autocratic".&lt;ref name="Defeated"&gt;Schweitzer, Sarah (November 4, 2004).

Those in attendance were to stand during meetings, and any latecomers were locked out. "It's to remind people we're here to get in and do our business and get out," he explained.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, David E. (August 8, 2004).

== Personal life ==
Benson resides in [[Rye, New Hampshire]] with his wife Denise. They have two daughters.

Benson serves as an adjunct lecturer at [[Babson College]], his alma mater.

'''Defend Innovation''' is a [[patent]] reform project started by [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) in June 2012. The project initially proposed seven changes to United States's patent system, including shortening the term for [[software patent]]s, requirement to provide the running software code along with patent application, and avoidance of liability of an infringer who independently arrives at the patented invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EFF Launches New Patent Reform Project to Defend Innovation|url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-launches-new-patent-reform-project-defend-innovation|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposals|url=https://defendinnovation.org/proposals|website=Defend Innovation|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222074452/https://defendinnovation.org/proposals|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Since June 2012, the project collected information about the patent system from lawyers, software engineers, court cases, and other sources. The information collected was combined with EFF's own expertise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patents|url=https://www.eff.org/patent|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compiled in a whitepaper named ''How to Fix Our Broken Patent System'', which details the issues surrounding the patent system and proposes solutions that can be implemented by the Congress, Patent Office, and also the software companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defend Innovation|url=https://defendinnovation.org/|website=Defend Innovation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whitepaper is available at the Defend Innovation website.

'''Eastman Business Park''', formerly '''Kodak Park''', is a large manufacturing and industrial complex in the city of [[Rochester, New York]], in the United States. The complex is run by [[Eastman Kodak]] and is located {{convert|3|mi|0}} north of downtown Rochester and {{convert|4|mi|0}} south of [[Lake Ontario]]. The complex runs parallel to [[New York State Route&amp;nbsp;104]] and Mount Read Boulevard for most of its length.

Eastman Business Park is serviced by both [[CSX]], via the [[Charlotte Running Track]], and [[Norfolk Southern]], via the [[Rochester and Southern Railroad]]. The plant also maintains an [[Kodak Park Railroad|intra-plant railroad]]. It was formerly serviced by the [[Rochester Subway]] via the Dewey Avenue surface connection.

The ashes of Eastman Kodak founder [[George Eastman]] are buried here.

== History ==
[[File:GeorgeEastmanMonumentEastSide.JPG|thumb|Memorial to George Eastman at Eastman Business Park.  His ashes lie beneath the [[Creole marble|Georgia marble]] monument.]]In the decades following 1890 Kodak Park was constructed to meet the massive demand of Eastman Kodak Company's Photographic and Motion Picture Film products. The park would eventually become the largest photographic product manufacturing facility in the world, employing over 15,000 employees in over 154 different buildings spanning its 1,300 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lipsitzponterio.com/JobSites/City/Rochester/KodakPark/HistoryofKodakPark|title=History of Kodak Park|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 2000s Eastman Kodak began downsizing its film manufacturing operations due to the shrinking demand for film.

The '''Eleanor Cabot Bradley Estate''' is a nonprofit country house and garden ground museum in [[Canton, Massachusetts]]. It is operated by [[The Trustees of Reservations]]. The grounds are open every day, sunrise to sunset, without charge.

==History==
In 1902, Dr. Arthur Tracey Cabot (b. 1852 in Boston to Dr. [[Samuel Cabot III]] and Hannah Lowell Jackson Cabot)&lt;ref name=DrArthurTCabotDates&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AS4EAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT66 |title=Biographical History of Massachusetts: Biographies and Autobiographies of the Leading Men in the State, Volume II|publisher=Massachusetts Biographical Society|year=1913|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; hired architect [[Charles A. Platt]] to design a country house with landscaping and outlying farm buildings. Its formal grounds include lawns, a [[walled garden]], and a [[parterre]]. Dr. Cabot had seven siblings,&lt;ref name=DrSamIIIHannahLowellHacksonCabot&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GPssAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187#v=snippet&amp;q=married%20hannah%20lowell%20jackson&amp;f=false|title=A Cyclopedia of American Medical Biography: Comprising the Lives of Eminent Deceased Physicians and Surgeons from 1610 to 1910|publisher=W.B.

Special to The New York Times.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 5, 1912|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate was passed on to his niece, Eleanor Cabot (daughter of his brother, [[Godfrey Lowell Cabot]]), who married Major Ralph Bradley in 1919.&lt;ref name=EleanorCabotBradley&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zAZUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA8 |title=Town &amp; Country, Volumes 75-76|work=[[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]]|date=February 20, 1919|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, she added ponds, a [[camellia]] house and [[greenhouse]], and planted specimen trees. Additional land includes more than {{convert|60|acre|m2}} of meadows and woods, with some {{convert|3|mi|km}} of walking trails.

The property was acquired through a bequest of Eleanor Cabot Bradley in 1991.&lt;ref name="bradhist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetrustees.org/places-to-visit/greater-boston/bradley-estate.html |title=Eleanor Cabot Bradley Estate: Property History |publisher=The Trustees of Reservations |accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Kerala State Investment Board]] will be set up by the [[Government of Kerala]] to speed up clearance for proposals. Necessary amendments would be made to the single-window clearance Act, including making the application process online.

The [[Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation]] (KINFRA) would create one lakh sq ft built-up space in 16 months for incubators and complete the first phase of 25,000 sq ft by May 2013, making the world’s largest telecom incubator. The State government plans to strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem by creating Technology Innovation Zone on about 10 acres in [[Kochi]] at an initial investment of Rs.100 crore.

==Mega Projects==

A number of Mega projects are being conceptualized and developed in the State, the most prominent of which are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emergingkerala2012.org/mega-projects.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supplementary Gas Infrastructure Project'''

A Joint Venture Company, [[Kerala Gail Gas Limited]] (KGGL) has been formed between [[Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation|KSIDC]] and M/s. [[GAIL]] Gas Limited.  KGGL will take up activities like City Gas Distribution in Kerala, CNG Stations for [[Kerala State Road Transport Corporation|KSRTC]] Buses, establishment of [[Gas Training Institute]], laying of Spur Lines from GAIL's main pipeline, setting up of small Gas based small power generating plants etc. The total investment for the project is estimated at Rs.2,000 Crores ($400 million).

'''[[Vizhinjam International Seaport|Vizhinjam International Deepwater Multipurpose Seaport]]'''

The Vizhinjam International Deepwater Multipurpose Seaport is an ambitious project of [[Government of Kerala]], being developed at [[Vizhinjam]] in [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. The project is proposed to follow Landlord Port Model, where dredging, reclamation and basic infrastructure like construction of break-water and quay will be done by [[Vizhinjam International Seaport Ltd]]. (a company fully owned by Govt of Kerala). Port Operation will be on [[public–private partnership]] (PPP) model. Terminal superstructure will be built by private operator who will also operate and maintain it for 30 years. The port development along with the external infrastructure work is envisaged to be carried out in phases with the cumulative cost estimated at around Rs. 7000 Crores ($1.4 billion). The port is envisaged to provide in total 2000m of quay length in three phases and is designed to cater primarily for containers transshipment, besides providing for other type of cargo such as Multi-Purpose, Break Bulk.

'''[[Kochi Metro|Kochi Metro Rail Project]]'''

The Project envisages construction of a world-class Light Mass Rapid Transit System in [[Kochi]] to enhance the quality of life for the Greater Kochi metro area by improving regional connections and reducing overcrowding, traffic congestion, transit time, air and noise pollution. The Project, having a total route length of 25&amp;nbsp;km would be having 21 stations, from [[Aluva]] to [[Pettah, Thiruvananthapuram|Pettah]]. The construction methodology proposed is elevated viaduct carried over pre-stressed concrete ‘U’ shaped girders. A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) by the name ‘[[Kochi Metro Rail Limited]]’ has been formed for the implementation of the project. The estimated project cost is Rs. 4500 Crores ($900 million).

'''[[Thiruvananthapuram Monorail|Monorail Project in Thiruvananthapuram]]'''

This is a prestigious single-rail mass transit project of Government of Kerala having a route length of 28.4&amp;nbsp;km, connecting the towns of [[Kazhakoottam]] and [[Balaramapuram]] in [[Thiruvananthapuram district]]. Monorail is a rail-based transportation system based on a single rail, which acts as its sole support and guideway. The rail will be straightened on a track upon the median that divides the main road. Concerns like land acquisition will be minimum, as only junctions are needed to be widened to incorporate the passage. The running train is to consist of four cars capable of carrying more than 200 persons at a time. The trains would breeze past through the elevated rails at a safe speed of 40Kmph. The total project cost is estimated at Rs. 3408 Crores ($682 million). The detailed Traffic study on the project is being done by [[National Transportation Planning &amp; Research Centre]] (NATPAC).

In [[economics]], '''fragmentation''' means organization of [[Production (economics)|production]] in which different stages of production are divided among different suppliers that are located in different countries. Now products traded between firms in different countries are components instead of final products. Final products may be sold to outside the region in which fragmentation happens ([[East Asia]]n countries often sell their final products to [[European Union|Europe]] and the [[United States of America|USA]] for example). Producers in [[less developed countries]] get positions of production chain that add less value to final product. Their challenge is to "climb upwards" on transnational production chain. Production chains are often vertical hierarchies in which big multinational companies may be those who sell final products and set production standards for "lesser" producers. This kind of fragmentation is an important part of contemporary globalisation.

'''Francesco Coco''' (born 8 January 1977) is a retired Italian [[association football|football]] [[Defender (association football)|defender]]. He has represented [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
Born in [[Paternò]], Coco spent the majority of his club career with the [[Milan]] clubs; first with [[A.C. Milan]] between 1993 and 2002 and later with [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|F.C. Internazionale]] between 2002 and 2007. He also had several loan spells with [[Vicenza Calcio]], [[Torino F.C.]] and [[FC Barcelona]]. He won two [[Scudetto|Scudetti]] with Milan.&lt;ref name="worldsoccer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calciomercato"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calciomercato.com/news/che-fine-ha-fatto-coco-quando-per-un-calciatore-il-pallone-diven-841517|title=Che fine ha fatto? Coco, quando per un calciatore il pallone diventa secondario|publisher=Calciomercato.com|language=Italian|author1=Alessandro Di Gioia|date=15 April 2016|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Milan traded Coco to Inter in [[part exchange]] for [[Clarence Seedorf]], a deal worth €28 million. Despite reaching the [[2002–03 UEFA Champions League|2002–03 Champions League]] semi-finals with Inter, Coco's career after joining Inter was blighted by injuries. Coco has since given interviews stating the Nerazzurri made a mistake by letting him undergo back surgery in November 2003, telling him he would be out for no more than a month. In the end he had to recover for two years. He won the [[2004–05 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] with Inter during the [[2004–05 Serie A|2004–05 season]]. In [[2005–06 Serie A|2005–06]], he was loaned to [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]], after rejecting a move to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] despite playing a friendly against [[Yeading F.C.]] where he impressed in a 5–0 home victory. He played one season at Livorno, and after his loan deal he returned to Inter. During the summer of 2006 he tried to find a new club, but in the end all negotiations failed and Coco remained at Inter. In January 2007, he joined English club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on a trial but after three days the club told him he was not in their plans. Later the English newspapers alleged that Manchester City was no longer interested in him because he had turned up for training smoking a cigarette.&lt;ref name="worldsoccer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2007/01/sezioni/sport/calcio/coco-fuma/coco-fuma/coco-fuma.html "Fuma durante l'allenamento" Il Manchester City liquida Coco – Calcio – Sport – Repubblica.it&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After a loan to [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] for the [[2006–07 Serie A|2006–07]] season, he went back to Inter for the first part of the summer but mutually rescinded his contract with the Milan-based club on 7 September 2007.&lt;ref name="freeagent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?N=27296&amp;L=en|publisher=Inter.it|title=Coco contract dissolved|accessdate=7 September 2007|date=7 September 2007}},&lt;/ref&gt; Later Coco declared his intention to quit football in order to pursue an acting career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/sep7o.html |title=Francesco goes to Hollywood |publisher=Football Italia |date=7 September 2007 |accessdate=8 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012172131/http://channel4.com/sport/football_italia/sep7o.html |archivedate=12 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the rumoured interest of MLS sides [[New England Revolution]] and [[New York Red Bulls]].

==International career==
Coco played for the [[Italy national under-18 football team|Italy U18]] team in the intermediary round of 1995 [[European Under-19 Football Championship|European Under-18 Football Championship]] and the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy U21 team]] at the [[1996 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|1996]] and [[1998 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|1998]] [[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|UEFA U-21 Championship]] qualifying phases, playing also in the final round in the successful [[2000 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2000 campaign]] under manager [[Marco Tardelli]]. Also, Coco played for the victorious Italy U23 team at the [[1997 Mediterranean Games]].&lt;ref name="calciomercato"/&gt;

Coco's full debut for the [[Italy national football team]] came in a 3–0 win against [[Romania national football team|Romania]], on 7 October 2000, in a [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2002 World Cup qualifying]] match under [[Giovanni Trapattoni]]. He also played for Italy in [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], and was last called up to the national side in September 2002. He achieved a total of 17 caps with the ''azzurri''.&lt;ref name="worldsoccer"/&gt;

==Style of play==
Coco was a quick, physical, and tactically versatile player, who was primarily deployed as an offensive-minded [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|fullback]] or as a [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wingback]], due to his tenacity, and work-rate, as well as his defensive and offensive attributes. Although he was naturally right footed, he was also capable of playing both on the right and the left flank, and was known for his strong tackling, physicality, determination, and [[Cross (football)|crossing]] ability with both feet. Due to his pace, stamina, skill, and technique, he was also occasionally utilised as a [[Midfielder#Winger|wide midfielder]] in a [[Formation (association football)#3–5–2|3–5–2]] or [[Formation (association football)#3–4–3|3–4–3 formation]]. Despite his talent, he was often injury-prone and inconsistent, while he had a difficult character and lacked discipline off the pitch; his chances were often limited both at club and international level, due to the presence of [[Paolo Maldini]] in his position, whom Coco had initially been tipped to replace as Milan and Italy's starting left-back.&lt;ref name="worldsoccer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/334928-334928|title=Francesco Coco: a case of what might have been|publisher=World Soccer|author1=Jamie Rainbow|author2=Jamie Lindsay|date=13 May 2012|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="calciomercato"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.raisport.rai.it/news/sport/calcio/200105/01/3aef1cd700308/|title=Lotta per la coppa|publisher=RaiSport|language=Italian|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantagazzetta.com/Rubriche/memento-francesco-coco-dal-milan-all-isola-dei-famosi-163780|title=MEMENTO - Francesco Coco, dal Milan all'Isola dei Famosi|website=fantagazzetta.com|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1022803.stm|title=Italy squad at a glance|publisher=BBC|date=14 November 2000|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Off the field==
Coco was not only a football player but also a businessman. Together with his father Antonio, they own shops and he has his own clothing label called "Urban 77". Coco is a celebrity in Italy and is well known in the party and society scene in Italy. He also wrote the foreword for the recently published book ''Mio marito è un calciatore'' (''My husband is a footballer''). Coco also famously had a long relationship with the Italian actress, showgirl, and model [[Manuela Arcuri]].&lt;ref name="calciomercato"/&gt;

Following his retirement from professional football, Coco stated that he was interested in pursuing an acting career, and accepted to appear in ''[[L'Isola dei Famosi]]'', the Italian celebrity adaptation of the TV format ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'', which he abandoned voluntarily days after the beginning of the show.&lt;ref name="calciomercato"/&gt;

As of 8 June 2011, it has been reported on [[Twitter]] that Francesco Coco is working as a real estate agent in Italy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7704">In [[marketing]], '''geomarketing''' (also called '''marketing geography''') is a discipline that uses [[geolocation]] ([[Geography|geographic]] information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.&lt;ref name= "qr10"&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf "Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data"], Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in any aspect of the [[marketing mix]] – the product, price, promotion, or place ([[geo targeting]]).  [[Market segments]] can also correlate with location, and this can be useful in targeted marketing.

Geomarketing isapplied  in the financial sector through identifying ATMs traffic generators and creating hotspots maps based on geographical parameters integrated with customer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amcham.org.eg/Publications/BusinessMonthly/december%2007/CoverStory.asp Geomarketing] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080312045856/http://www.amcham.org.eg/Publications/BusinessMonthly/december%2007/CoverStory.asp |date=2008-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geomarketing has a direct impact on the development of modern trade and the reorganization of retail types. Site selection becomes automated and based on scientific procedures that saves both time and money. Geomarketing uses key facts, a good base map, [[Whois]] data layers, consumer profiling, and success/fail criteria.

[[GPS tracking]] and [[GSM localization]] can be used to obtain the actual position of the travelling customer.

==Geo marketing software==
[[Geolocation software]] is used to display data that can be linked to a geographic region or area.  It can be used to:
* Recommend nearby social events.&lt;ref name = "qr10"/&gt;
* Determine where the customers are (on country, city, street or user level).
* Determine who the customer is (on organisation or user level), or make a guess on it based on earlier encounters by tracking [[IP address]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipinfodb.com/ip_location_api.php|publisher=IPInfoDB|author=IPInfoDB|title=IP location XML API|date=2010-04-18|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; credit card information, VOIP address, etc.
* Visualize any data in a geographic context by linking it to a digital map.
* Locate a web client's computer on a digital map.
* Calculate summary information for specific areas.
* Select customers within specific areas.
* Select customers with a certain radius of a point.
* Using micro-geographic segmentation select customers similar to a specific type in the rest of the country.

Some of the software used includes [[Geoconcept]] Sales&amp;Marketing Portal, MapInfo, ArcGIS (ESRI), RegioGraph (GfK), WIGeoWeb (WIGeoGIS) assorted open source like Mapwindow, DIVA (which while normally used for bio-diversity creates very visually pleasing density maps), GRASS (which works in Linux and Windows environments) [[GeoEdge]] (tracking local ads and pages). Several other software are available. Indeed, Google Earth provides an excellent set of images that are always useful.

==Applications for Geo==

===Different content by choice===
Location-based social media marketing uses geo-specific tools to draw imaginary perimeters that will display all of the social content posted by users in that particular area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://growingsocialmedia.com/location-based-social-media-marketing/|title=Location Based Social Media Marketing|author=Lauren Wilson |publisher=Growing Social Media|date=22 August 2016|access-date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical example for different [[web content]] by location is the FedEx website at FedEx.com where users have the choice to select their country geo —location first and are then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection.

===Automated different content===
Individuals can deliver different content in [[internet marketing]], through paid or organic search results, based on the geographical [[geolocation]] of the targeted audiences.

===Other applications===
* Solve problems regarding location of a new [[retail]] outlet
* Map consumer demand trends to best distribute products and advertising. This links with trade zone management.
* Scope digital advertising towards individual consumers and producers.
* Research consumer shopping patterns and observe traffic within shopping centers and between retail outlets. It also helps in visualisation of market research findings and help improve the overall planning ability of organisations.
* Improve customer cooperation.
* Creation of sales territories

We can define the geo-marketing as a strategy and mechanism that provides valuable information that helps in the process of making business decisions using geographical information. The functions of this to search and evaluate marketing opportunities, analyzing geographical information such as location residential areas, topography, it also analyzes demographic information such as age, genre, annual income and lifestyle. This information can be segmented as primary data and sub-segmented as secondary data; in addition, it helps us to develop successful promotional campaigns achieving our marketing goals. This also works with retail chain stores in the sales industry, real estate, and renewable energy, among others.

With geomarketing, the general data of a company changes to be more specific regarding their customers and market trends. This allows companies to use secondary data wisely, providing excellent results at low cost compared with traditional market research methods. All data is acquired accurately with GPS equipment and geographical information software, once the data is acquired, this information is processed by professionals in the field.

Geomarketing has helped companies to acquire valuable information such as transit behaviors, most visited places or areas, etc., this information will help these companies to deliver the right message (or promotion), at the right time and place. Most companies use their mobile apps to obtain this information. Mobile apps became more sophisticated using GPS, Bluetooth, and also social networks to obtain their market information, this information helps to improve their promotional campaigns. According to [[comScore]], about 60 percent of all Internet activities in the U.S. originates from mobile devices and about half of total Internet traffic flows through mobile apps.

One example of Geo Location is Google Maps - you can search in Google Maps Restaurants near me and it will show different options around your location. One important factor that companies (in this case restaurants) is that they must be sure to optimize their business in Google's directory list.

The '''Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors''' ('''IRBA'''), formerly known as '''Public Accountants and Auditors Board''' ('''PAAB'''), is a statutory body controlling [[public accountancy]] in the [[Republic of South Africa]].

The designation conferred by the board is Registered Auditor (RA). It is important to stress that all entrants to the public accountancy profession are subject to consistent requirements. Following qualification, accountants entering into public practice are required to register with the IRBA and are governed by its regulations. Qualified accountants entering other disciplines who are members of a provincial society of chartered accountants, are not subject to the jurisdiction of the IRBA but are subject to the jurisdiction of the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants.

The IRBA functions in terms of the Auditing Profession Act, 2005 (Act 26 of 2005). Its members are appointed by the Minister of Finance, who must appoint competent persons, including registered auditors, to effectively manage and guide the activities of the Regulatory Board, based on their knowledge and experience.

The Board consists of not less than six but not more than 10 members and, disregarding any vacancy in its membership, not more than 40% of the members of the Board may be registered auditors.

The '''Institute of Financial Accountants (IFA)''' is a [[professional body]] representing and providing certification for financial accountants in the [[United Kingdom]].  The IFA is a full member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]].

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1916.&lt;ref name=accounting-history&gt;[http://www.icaew.com/en/library/historical-resources/accountancy-profession/index-of-uk-and-irish-accountancy-and-professional-bodies Index of UK and Irish Accountancy and Professional Bodies] at [[ICAEW]] website&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1973, the IFA established the [[International Association of Book-keepers]] (IAB)&lt;ref name=accounting-history/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFAbenfund&gt;IFA. [http://www.ifa.org.uk/members/new-members/membership-benefits/benevolent-fund/ Benevolent Fund] Page accessed June 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and members of IAB participate in IFA's benevolent fund.&lt;ref name=IFAbenfund/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Open Charities. [http://opencharities.org/charities/234082 The Institute of Financial Accountants and International Association of Book-Keepers Benevolent Fund] Page accessed June 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA) granted reciprocal exemption to the IFA for seven of its exams.&lt;ref name=AA1007Aug&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1785081/institutes-ifa-acca-damages-claim-syllabus-copying IFA faces big ACCA damages claim for syllabus copying], ''Accountancy Age'', 8 Aug 1997&lt;/ref&gt; However, in that same year [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] sued IFA for plagiarising ACCA's examination syllabi.&lt;ref name=AA1007Aug/&gt;  The parties neared a settlement agreement.&lt;ref&gt;John Stokdyk for Accountancy Age. 01 Jul 1998 [http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1771012/institutes-acca-issues-plagiarism-writ Institutes - ACCA issues plagiarism writ]&lt;/ref&gt; However ''Accountancy Age'' reported that, "The High Court found the IFA had plagiarised large portions of ACCA's syllabus, including a typographical error."&lt;ref&gt;Accountancy Age, 17 July 1998 [http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1783936/news-brief-july News in Brief]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, during a round of merger talks between certain chartered bodies, talks took place with the [[ICAEW]] with a view to establishing IFA both as a feeder body, and as a 'fall-back' professional body for accountants who had not passed the final exams of other bodies such as CIMA or ACCA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1764999/icaew-talks-planned-home-failed-chartereds ICAEW talks planned new home for 'failed' chartereds], ''Accountancy Age'', 19 Jan 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, talks took place between the IFA, the [[Association of Accounting Technicians]] (AAT) and the [[International Association of Book-keepers]] (IAB), regarding the creation of a joint qualification structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1757639/accounting-bodies-discuss-qualifications-merger Accounting bodies to discuss qualifications merger], ''Accountancy Age'', 24 Apr 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, IFA members are recognised by [[HM Treasury]] as supervisors under [[Money_laundering#Enforcement|anti-money laundering legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/anti-money-laundering-and-counter-terrorist-finance-supervision-reports/anti-money-laundering-and-counter-terrorist-finance-supervision-report-2012-13 HM Treasury AML/CFT Report] Retrieved 15 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the IFA became an associate member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), and a full member in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifac.org/news-events/2011-11/international-federation-accountants-welcomes-new-members-and-associates International Federation of Accountants Welcomes New Members and Associates], IFAC, 16 November 2011. Retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

IFA merged with the [[Federation of Tax Advisers]] (FTA) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fta.uk.com/FTA/downloads/pdf/pressreleases/PR8_FTA_Conference.pdf FTA’s First Annual Conference celebrated its merge with the IFA Group], FTA, 8 June 2009.  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/60AwKOP0Q?url=http://www.fta.uk.com/FTA/downloads/pdf/pressreleases/PR8_FTA_Conference.pdf |date=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the IFA announced a merger with the [[Institute of Public Accountants]] of Australia to form the IPA Group; the world's largest SME/SMP professional accountancy body. Members of the IFA obtained membership of the IPA at their equivalent IFA membership grade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professionalplanner.com.au/cut-and-paste/2014/10/15/ipa-and-ifa-unite-to-form-the-worlds-largest-smesmp-accounting-group-31746/ Professional Planner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.accountancylive.com/uk-ifa-and-australian-ipa-institutes-merge Accountancy Live 18 Dec 2014, Retrieved 10 Jan 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, IFA had about 10,000 members in about 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifa.org.uk/about-us/ IFA.ORG About Us] Retrieved 29 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership and certifications==
To be admitted to membership of the IFA, applicants must generally complete a period of relevant work experience and pass a series of examinations; applicants can also be admitted to membership by way of exemption or by accreditation of prior learning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifa.org.uk/members/new-members/routes-to-membership/ Routes to membership]. IFA.&lt;/ref&gt;

IFA is recognised by the [[Ofqual|Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation]] (Ofqual). Ofqual regulates qualifications, examinations and assessments in England and vocational qualifications in Northern Ireland and grants formal recognition to bodies and organisations that deliver qualifications and assessments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/who-we-are Who we are], Ofqual. Retrieved 14 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2015 IFA offers various certifications in financial accounting, tax advisement, and financial and business management, all in [[small and medium-sized enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://register.ofqual.gov.uk/Qualification?recognitionNumber=RN5331 The Register of Regulated Qualifications] Ofqual Register Retrieved 11 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==University links==

In 2003, the IFA agreed to grant membership to accountancy graduates from the Bolton Institute, now the [[University of Bolton]], where the course includes vocational aspects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B_4BJWXYnmkC&amp;lpg=PA440&amp;ots=qzPKLfWrxr&amp;dq=Institute%20of%20Financial%20Accountants%20membership%20levels&amp;pg=PA440#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false British Qualifications], [[Kogan Page]], 36th Edition (2006), page 440&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Northampton]] cooperates with IFA to offer [[continuing professional development]] for IFA members, leading to a BA (Hons) degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northampton.ac.uk/study/courses/courses-by-subject/business-and-management/international-accounting-topup-ba-hons-ifa University of Northampton International Accounting (Top Up BA Hons) IFA] Retrieved 21 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Internal Auditors''' ('''IIA''') is the [[internal audit]] profession's most widely recognized advocate, educator, and provider of standards, guidance, and certifications. Established in 1941, the IIA today serves more than 190,000 members from more than 170 countries and territories. IIA's global headquarters are in Lake Mary, Fla., United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://na.theiia.org/membership/Pages/Membership.aspx|title=Membership|website=na.theiia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IIA Mission ==

The stated mission of The Institute of Internal Auditors is to provide "dynamic leadership" for the global profession of [[internal audit]]ing. This includes:

:*Advocating and promoting the value that internal audit professionals add to their organizations;

:*Providing comprehensive professional education and development opportunities; standards and other professional practice guidance; and certification programs;

:*Researching, disseminating, and promoting to practitioners and stakeholders knowledge concerning internal auditing and its appropriate role in [[Control (management)|control]], [[risk management]], and [[governance]];

:*Educating practitioners and other relevant audiences on [[best practice]]s in internal auditing;

:*Bringing together internal auditors from all countries to share information and experiences.

== Certified Internal Auditor (CIA)==

The CIA (''Certified Internal Auditor'') is the primary professional designation offered by The IIA.  The CIA designation is a globally recognized certification for internal auditors and is a standard by which individuals may demonstrate their competency and professionalism in the internal audit field.

Earning the CIA qualification is intended to demonstrate a professional knowledge of the internal audit profession.  CIAs are required to take continuing education courses.

Many CIAs today are senior internal audit [[Management|managers]], [[Vice President]]s, [[Executive director|Director]]s and [[Chief Audit Executive]]s in top global [[Multinational corporation|MNC companies]] driving internal audit functions in their respective companies.

== Other certificates offered by the IIA ==

* Certification in [[Control self-assessment|Control Self Assessment (CCSA)]]
* Certified Government Auditing Professional (CGAP), for [[Government performance auditing]] and Government Auditors
* Certified Financial Services Auditor (CFSA)
* Certification in Risk Management Assurance (CRMA)
* Qualification in Internal Audit Leadership (QIAL)

== Professional Standards: the International Professional Practices Framework ==

The IIA has two levels of professional guidances: (1) Mandatory Guidance (including the Standards) and (2) Strongly Recommended Guidance. The two levels of guidance constitute the IIA's '''International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF)'''.

===Mandatory Guidance: the Definition of Internal Auditing, the Code of ethics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IIA Code of Ethics|url=http://www.theiia.org/guidance/standards-and-guidance/ippf/code-of-ethics/english/|work=IIA Code of Ethics|publisher=IIA|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IIA standards|url=http://www.theiia.org/guidance/standards-and-guidance/ippf/standards/full-standards/|work=IIA standards|publisher=IIA|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

These [[guidelines]] are mandatory for IIA members and [[internal audit]] organizations claiming to complete [[audit]]s to IIA [[technical standard]]s around  the world.  The guidelines and recommendations are recorded in what is referred to as the "Red Book."
* The Definition: Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization's operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes.
* The four principles of the IIA's '''Code of Ethics''' are [[Integrity]], [[objectivity (science)|Objectivity]], [[Confidentiality]] and [[Competence (human resources)|Competency]].
* The International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing:

'''Mikael Jungner''' (born 20 April 1965 in [[Helsinki]]) is the former party secretary of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland]], a member of the Finnish parliament, and a former [[managing director]] of the Finnish national broadcaster [[Yle]].

Junger grew up on the [[Finland|Finnish]] west coast in the city of [[Vaasa]]. He started a five-year term as Managing Director of Yle on 1 May 2005. Although he sought another term, the political board of Yle replaced him with [[Lauri Kivinen]], a member of National Coalition Party, on 1 May 2010. Jungner's term as the managing director of Yle is generally considered to have been a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marmai.fi/blogit/toimitukselta/article333559.ece?v=t |title=Jungner – liian hyvä Ylelle? ("Jungner – too good for YLE?’) |publisher=Markkinointi&amp;Mainonta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726134855/http://www.marmai.fi/blogit/toimitukselta/article333559.ece?v=t |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jungner was the director of information society relations at the Microsoft Corporation between 2002 and 2004. He was the former aide of previous Prime Minister [[Paavo Lipponen]]. It is commonly understood that Lipponen helped Jungner to get the Managing Director's position in Yle. In May 2010, Jungner was elected as the party secretary of the SDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/05/jungner_chosen_as_sdp_party_secretary_1719301.html |title=Jungner Chosen as SDP Party Secretary  |publisher=[[Finnish Broadcasting Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jungner's term proved to be a disappointment for the Social Democratic Party, which lost the 2015 elections.

Jungner, who belongs to the right-wing section of the Social Democratic Party of Finland, is a regular writer in Libera's web-pages, a libertarian foundation co-ordinated with [[Mont Pelerin Society]] and manned with members known to finance National Coalition Party.

Mikael Jungner was married to Yle speaker [[Maria Jungner]] 2007–2013. Currently he lives with Emilia Poikkeus, who is 26 years his junior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/viihde/art-1288775976256.html |title=Mikael Jungner saapuu Linnaan nuoren rakkaansa kanssa |publisher=[[Ilta-Sanomat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles''' ('''MOCA''') is a contemporary art [[museum]] with three locations in greater [[Los Angeles, California]]. The main branch is located on Grand Avenue in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], near [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]]. MOCA's original space, initially intended as a "temporary" exhibit space while the main facility was built, is now known as the Geffen Contemporary, in the [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, California|Little Tokyo]] district of downtown Los Angeles. The [[Pacific Design Center]] facility is in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]].

The museum's exhibits consist primarily of American and European [[contemporary art]] created after 1940. Since the museum's inception, MOCA's programming has been defined by its multi-disciplinary approach to contemporary art.

== Founding ==
In a 1979 political fund raising event at the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]], Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], Councilman [[Joel Wachs]], and local philanthropist [[Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation#History|Marcia Simon Weisman]] happened to be seated at the same table. Throughout the evening, Weisman passionately discussed the city's need for a contemporary art museum. Weisman's brother, [[Norton Simon]], had stepped in to bail out the financially ailing [[Pasadena Art Museum]] in 1975, but was unable to retain its focus on modern art. In the following weeks, the Mayor's Museum Advisory Committee was organized. The committee, led by [[William A. Norris]], set about creating a museum from scratch, including locating funds, trustees, directors, curators, a gallery, and most importantly an art collection. That same year, Weisman and five other key local collectors signed an agreement whereby they would pledge chunks of their private collections, worth up to $6 million, "to create a museum of standing and repute."&lt;ref name="A call for cultural passion"&gt;Barbara Isenberg (December 15, 2008), [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/15/opinion/oe-isenberg15 A call for cultural passion] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the fledgling Museum of Contemporary Art was operating out of an office on Boyd Street. The city's most prominent philanthropists and collectors had been assembled into a Board of Trustees in 1980, and set a goal of raising $10 million in their first year; an artists advisory council was involved early on.&lt;ref name="A call for cultural passion"/&gt; A working staff was brought together; [[Richard Koshalek]] was appointed chief curator; relationships were made with artists and galleries; and negotiations were begun to secure artwork and an exhibition space. Following Weisman's initiative, $1-million contributions from [[Eli Broad]], [[Max Palevsky]], and [[ARCO|Atlantic Richfield Co.]] helped securing the construction of the new museum;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-21/news/mn-1_1_marcia-simon-weisman | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Burt A. | last=Folkart | date=October 21, 1991 | title=Marcia Simon Weisman; Patron of Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broad became MOCA's founding chairman; Palevsky chaired the architectural search committee.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Leibowitz (June 1, 2003), [https://archive.is/20130127120306/http://www.lamag.com/features/Story.aspx?ID=1630570 Committee of One] ''Los Angeles Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of MOCA's initial donors were young and supporting the arts for the first time; a substantial number joined up at the $10,000 "founder" minimum.&lt;ref name="A call for cultural passion"/&gt;

== Collection ==
Making up well over 90% of the museum's works,&lt;ref&gt;Patt Morrison (November 21, 2009), [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/21/news/la-OE-MORRISON21-2009nov21 MOCA man] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; gifts from several major private collectors form the cornerstones of MOCA's permanent collection of nearly 6,000 works. Much of it has come from board members who donated or bequeathed key works or entire collections, or sold art to the museum at highly favorable terms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mike Boehm (September 28, 2012), [www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-moca-trustee-peter-brant-using-his-art-to-get-business-loans-20120928,0,649316.story MOCA trustee Peter Brant using his art to get business loans] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within months of its fall 1983 opening, MOCA was able to turn itself into an instant player in the international art world by striking a deal with one of its board members, [[Giuseppe Panza]], who agreed to sell a group of works for $11 million and stagger the payments over five years, interest-free.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The 1984 purchase of parts of the Panza Collection encompasses 80 seminal works of abstract expressionism and pop art by [[Jean Fautrier]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Mark Rothko]], and [[Antoni Tàpies]]. In 1985, the museum accepted [[Michael Heizer]]'s earthwork ''[[Double Negative (artwork)|Double Negative]]'' in Nevada desert, donated by [[Virginia Dwan]].&lt;ref&gt;William Wilson (December 10, 1985), [http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-10/entertainment/ca-15620_1_land-art New Moca Acquisition Is A Hole In The Ground] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1986 bequest by television executive Barry Lowen included 67 works of minimalist, post-minimalist and neo-expressionist painting, sculpture, photography and drawing by artists such as [[Dan Flavin]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Elizabeth Murray (born 1940)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Joel Shapiro]], [[Frank Stella]], and [[Cy Twombly]]. In 1989, pieces by the Rita and [[Taft Schreiber]] collection were donated to the museum, encompassing 18 paintings, sculptures, and drawings by [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Piet Mondrian]], and [[Arshile Gorky]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-05-10/news/mn-2977_1_moca-given-art-donation-rita-schreiber-moca-director-richard-koshalek | work=Los Angeles Times | first=William | last=Wilson | date=May 10, 1989 | title=MOCA Given Art Donation of $60 Million}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood agent Phil Gersh and his wife Beatrice, both founding members, gave 13 important pieces from their collection to the museum the same year, including Pollock's early drip painting ''Number 3, 1948'' and [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]]'s 8-foot-tall stainless steel sculpture ''[[Cubi|Cubi III]]'' (1961) — as well as works by artists such as [[Ed Ruscha]], [[Cindy Sherman]], and [[Susan Rothenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis McLellan (October 11, 2011), [http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/11/local/la-me-beatrice-gersh-20111011 Beatrice Gersh dies at 87; L.A. arts patron] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the museum's co-founder [[Marcia Simon Weisman]] bequeathed 83 works on paper from artists including [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Jasper Johns]] and California-based painters [[Richard Diebenkorn]] and [[Sam Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-02-16/news/mn-36760_1_art-collection | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Suzanne | last=Muchnic | date=February 16, 1996 | title=MOCA Is Given a Major Art Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Hollywood screenwriter [[Scott Spiegel]] donated works by [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Mark Innerst]], [[Robert Longo]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[David Salle]], among others. In 2003, the museum received the promise of a gift of 33 pieces from advertising executive Clifford Einstein, chair of MOCA's board of trustees, and his wife, Madeline; the proposed donation included works by [[Kiki Smith]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Mark Grotjahn]], [[Sigmar Polke]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], and [[Lari Pittman]].&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Muchnic (June 1, 2007), [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/01/entertainment/et-moca1 33 pieces gifted to MOCA] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the museum received the largest group of artworks donated by a private collector in the its 25-year history when [[E. Blake Byrne]], a MOCA trustee and retired television executive, gave 123 paintings, sculptures, drawings, videos and photographs by 78 artists.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Muchnic (December 17, 2004), [http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/17/local/me-moca17 Trustee's Donation a Milestone for MOCA] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, major donations of art collections have come from the Lannan Foundation and through funding from the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Boehm (November 8, 2009), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-ca-moca8-2009nov08,0,4791159.story MOCA celebrates 30 years and a rebirth] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, MOCA received gifts from artists themselves, including major pieces by sculptor and performance artist [[Paul McCarthy]], video artist [[Doug Aitken]] and photographer [[Andreas Gursky]].&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Muchnic (March 12, 2000), [http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/12/entertainment/ca-7853 Portrait of a Smooth Transition] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Los Angeles-based artist [[Ed Moses (artist)|Ed Moses]] made a major gift of his work to the museum in 1995, surveying nearly 40 years of his artistic development.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Muchnic (December 28, 1995), [http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-28/entertainment/ca-18456_1_ed-moses Ed Moses Wraps Up Year With Gift of Major Artworks for MOCA] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Included within today's permanent collection are works by further influential artists such as [[Greg Colson]], [[Kim Dingle]], [[Sam Durant]], [[David Hockney]], [[Kenneth Price]], [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Raymond Pettibon]], [[James Hayward (artist)|James Hayward]], and [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]]. As the [[Los Angeles Times]] declared, "There isn’t a city in America—not New York, not Chicago, not Houston, not San Francisco—where a more impressive museum collection of contemporary art can be seen."

== Exhibitions ==
Ever since it opened with an extensive exhibition called ''The First Show: Painting and Sculpture From Eight Collections, 1940-80'',&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Giovannini (November 27, 1983), [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/27/arts/a-new-museum-has-an-instant-impact.html A New Museum Has An Instant Impact] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; MOCA has been known for thematic-survey exhibitions about postwar art such as ''A Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of Representation'' (1989), ''A Minimal Future? Art as Object, 1958-1968'' (1994), ''Reconsidering the Object of Art: 1965-1975'' (1995), ''Hall of Mirrors: Art and Film since 1945'' (1996), ''Out of Actions: Between Performance and the Object, 1949-1979'' (1998), ''[[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]]'' (2007), ''[[Art in the Streets]]'' (2011), ''Under the Big Black Sun: California Art 1974–1981'' (2011), and ''Ends of the Earth: Land Art to 1974'' (2012). The museum also organized the first major museum retrospectives of the work of [[Allen Ruppersberg]] (1985), [[John Baldessari]] (1990), [[Ad Reinhardt]] (1991), [[Jeff Wall]] (1997), [[Barbara Kruger]] (1999), and [[Takashi Murakami]] (2007). In addition there were also monographic shows like an ambitious installation by [[Robert Gober]] in 1997, or a revelatory survey of [[Sigmar Polke]]'s photographic work in 1995. Since many of those shows traveled to New York and other cities in the U.S., like the show of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] combines that opened in Los Angeles in 2006, MOCA became known as "one of the greatest feeder museums in the country".&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (December 7, 2008), [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/08/arts/design/08moca.html Here’s How to Rescue a Museum at the Brink] ''[[New York Times]]''. Accessed 1 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the museum canceled a planned retrospective of influential yet under-recognized artist [[Jack Goldstein]] to commission artist and director [[Julian Schnabel]] to curate a survey of works by actor and artist [[Dennis Hopper]],&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Knight (July 11, 2010), [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/07/art-review-dennis-hopper-double-standard-moca.html Art review: 'Dennis Hopper Double Standard' @ MOCA's Geffen Contemporary] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012, actor [[James Franco]] curated a tribute exhibition to [[James Dean]], two projects that have been widely criticized for their emphasis on pop and celebrity culture. Of all solo shows on view over the period between January 2008 and December 2012, only about 28% were devoted to female artists.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Knight (July 11, 2013), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-women-artist-20130711,0,6560536.story LACMA, MOCA fall behind in giving female artists a solo platform] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides artists' retrospectives and art historical investigations, under chief curator [[Paul Schimmel (curator)|Paul Schimmel]], MOCA has mounted various multiartist theme shows on provocative or challenging topics. ''[[Helter Skelter: L.A. Art in the 1990s]]'', a 1992 exhibition focused on the dark side of contemporary life&lt;ref name="Mind-bending visions"&gt;Suzanne Muchnic (October 2, 2005), [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/02/entertainment/ca-ecstasy2 Mind-bending visions] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; as portrayed by artists like [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Paul McCarthy]] and [[Chris Burden]],&lt;ref name="Mike Boehm 2012"&gt;Jori Finkel and Mike Boehm (June 28, 2012), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-moca-schimmel-20120628,0,7180347.story L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art fires chief curator] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; involving themes such as alienation, dispossession, and violence. ''Out of Actions: Between Performance and the Object, 1949-1979'', a landmark historical survey presented in 1998, tracked the work of about 150 artists and collectives for whom public performances, in its links to painting, sculpture, dance and theater,&lt;ref name="Mike Boehm 2012"/&gt; and the creative process were far more important than well-crafted objects. ''Public Offerings'', in 2001, explored the phenomenon of youthful creative energy in an overheated art world where stars are created before they leave art school. In ''ECSTASY: In and About Altered States'' (2005), some of the artists' works represented altered states of mind that they have experienced under the influence of drugs or hypnosis.&lt;ref name="Mind-bending visions"/&gt; [[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]], held in 2007, was the first major retrospective of [[Feminist art movement|art and the feminist revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Ozler| first = Levent| title = Wack!: Art and the Feminist Revolution| work = Dexigner| accessdate = 2014-03-31| date = 2007-02-16| url = https://www.dexigner.com/news/10312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MOCA hosts the [[LA Freewaves]] biennial festival, which exhibits a wide range of new media.&lt;ref name="LAT03"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-27/entertainment/ca-1988_1_independent-video|title=Wave of Enthusiasm for L.A.

== Locations ==

=== MOCA Grand Avenue ===
[[File:MOCA LA 04.jpg|thumb|right|MOCA Grand Avenue]]
The MOCA Downtown Los Angeles location is home to almost 5,000 artworks created since 1940, including masterpieces by classic contemporary artists, and inspiring new works by emerging and mid-career artists from Southern California and around the world. The MOCA is the only museum in [[Los Angeles]] devoted exclusively to [[contemporary art]].

In 1986, the celebrated Japanese architect [[Arata Isozaki]], who had never worked on a project in the [[United States]] before,&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Isenberg (December 22, 1985), [http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-22/entertainment/ca-20085_1_moca Arata Isozaki: Architecture's Global Citizen] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; completed the downtown location's sandstone building to international critical and public acclaim, marking a dramatic achievement in the contemporary art world and heralding a new cultural era in Los Angeles. Its chief exhibition spaces are under the courtyard level, lit from above by groups of pyramidal skylights.&lt;ref name="Getting On the Map"&gt;Robert Hughes (June 24, 2001), [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,145762,00.html#ixzz1urWP5nyw Getting On the Map] ''[[Time Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction and $23 million cost of the MOCA Grand Avenue building was part of a city-brokered deal with the developer of the $1 billion [[California Plaza (disambiguation)|California Plaza]] redevelopment project on [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, California|Bunker Hill]], Bunker Hill Associates, who received the use of an {{convert|11|acre|m2|adj=on}}, publicly owned parcel of land.&lt;ref name="latimesDec2008"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rutten | first = Tim | title = What MOCA really needs | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = December 6, 2008 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-rutten6-2008dec06,0,3263190.column | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1985"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Hayes | first = Tome | title = Los Angeles: For Downtown, An Ambitious Mixed-Use Project | newspaper = New York Times | date = May 12, 1985 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DEED9153BF931A25756C0A963948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the grounds that the law said that 1.5% of the construction costs of new buildings had to be spent on fine-arts embellishments,&lt;ref name="Getting On the Map"/&gt; MOCA's board of trustees had struck a deal with the Community Redevelopment Agency to have the project developer build a 100,000-square-foot museum, designed by an architect of the trustees' choice, at no cost to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Muchnic (March 24, 1998), [http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/24/local/me-32119 MOCA Director to Resign; Helped Transform Museum] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In return for the free building, the agency required the trustees to raise $10 million for an operations endowment. Original plans had been for the building to open in time for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. However, the project broke ground in 1983 and completed the museum, Omni Hotel and the first of two skyscrapers ([[One California Plaza]]) by 1986. The second skyscraper ([[Two California Plaza]]) was completed in 1992.&lt;ref name="nytimesJan1987"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Diamonstein | first = Barbaralee | title = PRESERVING AMERICA'S PAST | newspaper = New York Times | date = January 18, 1987 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D91438F93BA25752C0A961948260&amp;sec=travel&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nancy Rubins]]' monumental stainless-steel sculpture "Mark Thompson's Airplane Parts" (2001), purchased by MOCA in honor of founding member Beatrice Gersh in 2002, was installed at the museum's plaza.

The Grand Avenue location is used to display pieces from MOCA's substantial permanent collection, especially artists who did much of their work between 1940 and 1980. There is also an extensive set of rooms used to display temporary exhibits, usually a major retrospective of an important artist, or works connected by a theme.

===The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Los Angeles County, California]] --&gt;
While the Grand Avenue facility was being planned and under construction, MOCA opened an interim exhibition space called the '''"Temporary Contemporary"''' in the fall of 1983. The new space was located at the edge of a [[warehouse district]] in which many Los Angeles artists worked at the time.&lt;ref name="A New Museum Has An Instant Impact"&gt;Joseph Giovannini (November 27, 1983), [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/27/arts/a-new-museum-has-an-instant-impact.html A New Museum Has An Instant Impact] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 17, 1983, the museum inaugurated the building with a [[Shinto]] purification ceremony, a ritual often held at groundbreakings in Little Tokyo, as a symbol of mutual recognition between the Japanese community and the museum.&lt;ref name="A New Museum Has An Instant Impact"/&gt; The first public program was a commissioned collaboration, "Available Light" by [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Frank O. Gehry]], and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] followed in November 1983 by the inaugural exhibition, "The First Show: Painting and Sculpture from 1940&amp;ndash;1980" curated by Julia Brown. The building had been originally constructed in the 1940s as a hardware store and subsequently used as a city warehouse and police car garage, the "TC", as it became informally known, is leased from the city for five years for $1 a year.&lt;ref name="latimesDec2008"/&gt;

Southern California architect [[Frank Gehry]] led the renovation of the [[Albert C. Martin, Sr.]]-designed 1947 Union Hardware buildings. Gehry left the exteriors intact, except for new entrance doors, and built a canopy of chain-link fencing and steel trusses over the closed-off street, to form a partially shaded plaza. There are two large, open gallery spaces, illuminated by industrial wire-glass skylights and a row of clerestory windows along the south wall. The intricate structural network of steel beams and supports has been left exposed, serving as support for the many movable display walls and lending a sculptural effect. A steel crane rail, left over from the building's hardware days, remained in place. The loading docks now serve as the lobby.&lt;ref name="nytimesJan1987"/&gt; The Temporary Contemporary immediately captivated critics and museum patrons alike with its accessibility, informality and lack of pretension. Writing in ''The New York Times'', [[John Russell (art critic)|John Russell]] referred to it as "a prince among spaces", and William Wilson of the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote that it "instantly had the hospitable aura of a people's museum." In the view of many, these two appraisals have been borne out in the ensuing years. The ''New York Times'' later wrote that "[m]ore than any event in recent decades, the Temporary (now known as the Geffen Contemporary) changed the cultural face of Los Angeles".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Muschamp (November 26, 2000), [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/26/arts/art-architecture-when-getting-to-it-is-part-of-a-museum-s-aesthetic.html When Getting to It Is Part of a Museum's Aesthetic] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the popularity of the Temporary Contemporary and extraordinary suitability of the building for exhibiting contemporary art, the museum's board requested that the City of Los Angeles extend MOCA's lease on the facility for 50 years, until 2038. That request was granted in early 1986, and in 1996 the city extended the lease even further. Also in 1996, MOCA received a $5-million gift from The [[David Geffen|David Geffen Foundation]] in support of the museum's endowment drive, and in recognition of this extraordinary gift, the Temporary Contemporary was renamed The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA.

The 55,000-square-foot facility gives enormous latitude to artists and encourages experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Muchnic (August 31, 1997), [http://articles.latimes.com/1997/aug/31/entertainment/ca-27430 Stop, Look and Look Again] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest of the three MOCA locations and is ideally suited to large-scale sculptural works and conceptual, multi-media or electronic installations. It is typically used to display more recent works, often by lesser-known artists, and works which require a large amount of space. Some of these works are designed specifically for the Geffen Contemporary's space.

=== MOCA at The Pacific Design Center ===
[[File:PacificDesignCenter MOCA03.jpg|thumb|right|MOCA at the [[Pacific Design Center]]]]

In 2000, MOCA opened a {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. exhibition space at the [[Pacific Design Center]] in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] to present new work by emerging and established artists as well as ancillary programs based upon its major exhibitions and renowned permanent collection. A recent focus has been on design and architecture. MOCA also utilizes the 384-seat PDC auditorium for a range of public programs.

== Programs ==

=== Sunday Studio ===
On the first Sunday of each month from 1pm to 3:30pm, Sunday Studio workshops typically begin with an interactive, discussion-based "spotlight" tour, highlighting selected works from a current exhibition. Next, participants work collaboratively to create art in response to the work they've seen.

Designed and taught by artists, these  process-oriented workshops extend the gallery experience and frequently include special activities such as musical performance, movement, and other multidisciplinary approaches to works on view. The program is offered in English and Spanish.

Big Family Day is an annual spring culminating event for all of MOCA's school and community partnership programs. Featuring student docents, entertainment, music, artmaking and a student art exhibition, this event usually attracts over 1,000 participants, including MOCA members, their families, and the community at large.

Sunday Studio events are held at Grand Avenue unless otherwise stated in the bimonthly calendar or on the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moca.org/program/sunday-studio|title=Sunday Studio|website=The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teens of Contemporary Art (TOCA) ===

Teens of Contemporary Art is an open gathering of high school students interested in learning more about contemporary art with their peers. The group meets each month for exhibition explorations, art workshops, discussions about contemporary art, and events planning. An advisory council of teens identifies the topics and issues addressed at the monthly sessions. All TOCA participants get free admission to the museum.

TOCA events are the second Sunday of every month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moca.org/education/teens|title=Teens • MOCA|website=The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MOCA Apprenticeship Program (MAP) ===
{{Unsourced section|date=January 2017}}

Each year the MOCA Apprenticeship Program (MAP) creates a supportive artistic community for a small, diverse group of high school students. During this nine-month internship program, apprentices meet weekly with MOCA staff and guest artists, undertake individual and self-directed projects throughout the museum and discover more about contemporary art, MOCA, and their own professional future. Apprentices are considered staff and are paid an hourly wage. MAP participation is available by application only. Applications are available and due in the spring of each year.

The program offered artist collectives three-month residencies during which they presented public programs at MOCA Grand Avenue and the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA on the first Thursday of each month from 7 to 10pm. Collectives employed many different mediums, disciplines, and strategies during their residency, resulting in programs that included performances, workshops, screenings, lectures, and many other activities emerging from the group's particular focus.

Participating Artists: Finishing School, [[Knifeandfork]] ([[Brian House]] and Sue Huang), OJO, Slanguage, [[My Barbarian]], [[Lucky Dragons]], [[Ryan Heffington]] + the East Siders, and [[The League of Imaginary Scientists]],  Neighborhood Public Radio, The Los Angeles Urban Rangers, [[Liz Glynn]], and CamLab.

=== Women in the Arts ===
The Women in the Arts event, established in 1994 by the MOCA fundraising arm the MOCA Projects Council, is a benefit for MOCA's educational programs and generally draws more than 600 people from the fields of art, fashion, philanthropy, film and other areas of entertainment. The Award to Distinguished Women in the Arts recognizes women providing leadership and innovation in visual arts, dance, music and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Vankin (September 19, 2013), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-sharon-stone-moca-20130919,0,1653313.story Sharon Stone will host MOCA's Distinguished Women in the Arts event] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Jenny Holzer]] designed the bronze plaque, which features one

==Management==

===Director===
In July 2018, [[MoMA PS1]] curator [[Klaus Biesenbach]] was named as the new director of MOCA, following the abrupt resignation of [[Philippe Vergne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Miranda |first1=Carolina A. |title=After months of turmoil, Museum of Contemporary Art gets a new director with ties to New York's famed MoMA |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-moca-new-director-klaus-biesenbach-20180731-story.html |accessdate=15 September 2018 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=Jul 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vergne, formerly the director of the [[Dia Art Foundation]] in New York, began his tenure as MOCA's director in January 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkel and Randy Kennedy|first=Jori|title=Los Angeles Museum Names A New Director|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/arts/design/museum-of-contemporary-art-picks-philippe-vergne-as-director.html?_r=0|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and ended it amid a series of controversies, including the firing of chief curator [[Helen Molesworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Miranda |first1=Carolina A. |title=After months of turmoil, Museum of Contemporary Art gets a new director with ties to New York's famed MoMA |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-moca-new-director-klaus-biesenbach-20180731-story.html |accessdate=15 September 2018 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=Jul 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Vergne, Maria Seferian served as interim director from September 2013 to March 2014, while the institution underwent the search for its next director.

Eli Broad's and Jeff Deitch's infamous firing of the respected curator on June 28, 2012 led to an exodus of trustees, committee members and a maelstrom of criticism in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mess at MOCA|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-moca-deitch-trustees-20120720,0,791057.story|accessdate=18 November 2012|newspaper=LA Times|date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1999 and 2008, Jeremy Strick led the institution. Before that, Richard Koshalek served as director, deputy director and chief curator from 1980 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/about/bios/richard-koshalek Richard Koshalek] [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pontus Hultén]] was founding director between 1980 and 1982.

Wesson Jr.]]), chief financial officer (Michael Harrison) and museum director (Philippe Vergne) are ''ex-officio'' members.&lt;ref name="MOCA Board"/&gt;

The current mayor and president of the city council have votes; their presence on the board is a condition for MOCA's long-term $1 a year lease on the Geffen Contemporary building.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Boehm and David Ng (April 10, 2013), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-0411-moca-board-bruce-karatz-20130411,0,7752300.story Three new names on MOCA board] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with a policy enacted in 1993, trustees serve three-year, renewable terms and rotate off after six years; they are generally invited to return after one year.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Muchnic (April 27, 1997), [http://articles.latimes.com/1997-04-27/entertainment/ca-52842_1_santa-ynez-valley/2 Douglas Cramer Strikes His Santa Ynez Set] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
Unlike the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], which is partly controlled by the county, MOCA receives minimal government funding and does not have a steady source of funds.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt; Its annual budget has grown to exceed $20 million, but it relies on donors to pay about 80% of its expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Boehm (November 19, 2008), [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/19/entertainment/et-moca19L.a.'s Moca In Deep Financial Trouble]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; MOCA's budget for the fiscal year 2011 was $14.3 million,&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (July 22, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/arts/design/hurdles-grow-at-the-museum-of-contemporary-art-los-angeles.html A Los Angeles Museum on Life-Support] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the museum's lowest spending since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mike Boehm (December 4, 2012), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-usc-and-moca-are-in-partnership-talks-20121204,0,63577.story USC and MOCA are in talks about 'a possible partnership'] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the museum reported net assets (basically, a total of all the resources it has on its books, except the value of the art) of $38 million.

In December 2008, during the world financial meltdown, newspapers reported that the museum's endowment, which partly depended on stock investments, had dropped and that museum had fiscal problems &lt;ref name ="Wyatt Finkel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/arts/design/05moca.html?em|title=Soaring in Art, Museum Trips Over Finances |last=Wyatt|first=Edward|author2=Jori Finkel|date=December 4, 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly in violation of state law,&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;Mike Boehm (April 16, 2010), [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/16/entertainment/la-et-moca-20100417 MOCA ordered to revamp its budget practices] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the museum lost $44 million of their $50 million endowment over nine years,&lt;ref name="Wyatt Finkel"/&gt; Deficits mounted at the rate of $2.8 million a year on average from mid-2000 to mid-2008.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;Mike Boehm (March 2, 2012), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-moca-finances-20120302,0,6680139.story MOCA loses three officials in key finance roles] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Amid speculation that the museum may close its doors, deaccession artworks, and/or merge with another institution, a grassroots, artist-led organization called MOCA Mobilization petitioned for MOCA to remain independent and keep its collection intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=Jori|title=MOCA mobilization is back in action|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/24/entertainment/la-et-cm-moca-mobilization-back-in-action-20120724 |accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, although the investigation was closed with no disciplinary action (Board members were asked to take a voluntary training in their fiduciary duties),&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt; just the report of the investigation in the [[Los Angeles Times]] had an enormous impact &amp;ndash; donors fled and the trustees, in the maelstrom, accepted Broad's terms for control of the institution in exchange for his promise to donate money.&lt;ref name="Bruck"/&gt; Broad, MOCA's founding chairman from 1979 to 1984 and life trustee of the museum, offered $30 million in a staggered donation, $15 million as [[matching donations]]. An agreement with Broad was tentatively reached on December 18, but another possibility—a merger with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]—had not been ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/arts/design/19moca.html|title=Los Angeles Museum Is Said to Near Rescue Deal |last=Wyatt|first=Edward|date=December 18, 2008 |work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 23, the museum announced that it had accepted Broad's offer and would be making a number of significant changes to its leadership.

The departure of respected curator Paul Schimmel on June 28, 2012 led to an exodus of trustees, committee members and a bombardment of criticism in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mess At MOCA|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-moca-deitch-trustees-20120720,0,791057.story|accessdate=18 November 2012|newspaper=LA Times|date=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; And because Broad himself has defaulted on his promised payments to MOCA that expire in 2013&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt; the viability of the institution has come into question under Broad's leadership. As of late 2012, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the private [[University of Southern California]] are in talks about a possible partnership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In a first for MOCA, a two-day [[Sotheby's]] auction of donated works by artists in May 2015 raised $22.5 million for the museum endowment; the sale included works by [[Mark Grotjahn]], [[Takashi Murakami]] and [[Ed Ruscha]].&lt;ref&gt;David Ng and Deborah Vankin (May 13, 2015), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-moca-sothebys-20150513-story.html Works donated by artists raise $22.5 million for Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attendance===
MOCA exhibitions draw roughly 60% of their visitors from the L.A. area; their attendance totaled 236,104 in 2010, up by nearly 90,000 over the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Jori Finkel (March 30, 2011), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-museum-attendance-2-20110329,0,5374018.story Attendance at L.A. museums lags behind] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, his net worth was estimated by [[Forbes]] to be $1.8 billion, making him the 854th richest person in the world.

==Personal life==
Born in the Karadat Mariam area of Baghdad, Iraq in 1937 to an [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean]] family, Auchi attended Al Mansoor Primary School and [[Baghdad College|Baghdad College High School]], before going on to study at Baghdad's [[Mustansiriyah University]]. He married his wife Ibtisam in 1963, and together they have 3 daughters and 1 son, born in 1964 and 1972 respectively. In 1979, he and his family fled to London following an extortion attempt by an enforcer for [[Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti]]. Six years later, Auchi's younger brother Naseer was hanged by the Baathist regime after discovering the extent of al-Tikriti's corruption.&lt;ref name="NAF1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nadhmiauchifoundation.org/biography/1937-to-1954 |title=Biographical Timeline |publisher=Nadhmi Auchi Foundation |year=2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auchi became a British citizen in 1989 and currently resides in London.&lt;ref name="AAO" /&gt; He and his wife &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmhsa.com/news2009.html |title=News and Events 2009 |year=2009 |publisher=General Mediterranean Holding |accessdate=25 July 2011 |quote=Ibtisam and I share a common desire to foster greater inter-religious relations with the followers of all faiths and we are both well aware and appreciate the important work of the late Pope John Paul II and the current Pope in fostering such work globally |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820211923/http://www.gmhsa.com/news2009.html |archivedate=20 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nadhmiauchifoundation.org/2010/07/21/qa-with-nadhmi-auchi |title=Q&amp;A with Nadhmi Auchi |publisher=Nadhmi Auchi Foundation |year=2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711134338/http://www.nadhmiauchifoundation.org/2010/07/21/qa-with-nadhmi-auchi |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have aimed to promote inter-faith dialogue, unity among Arab states, and to build bridges between the West and the Arab world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nadhmiauchifoundation.org/good-causes |title=Good Causes |publisher=Nadhmi Auchi Foundation |year=2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; through charitable and humanitarian work, for which Auchi has been recognised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=25967481 |title=Nadhmi Auchi: Executive Profile &amp; Biography |publisher=Bloomberg L.P |year=2011 |work=businessweek.com |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onthescene.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/06/20/10-iraqis-you-should-know/#Nadhm |title=10 Iraqis You Should Know |first=David |last=MacDougall |author2=Ghalib, Tawfiq |publisher=FOX News Network |date=20 June 2008 |work=foxnews.com |accessdate=25 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726104057/http://onthescene.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/06/20/10-iraqis-you-should-know/#Nadhm |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Auchi graduated with a B.Sc. in Economics and Political Science from [[Al-Mustansiriya University]], Baghdad, in 1967. He also worked with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, becoming Director of Planning and Development in 1969.&lt;ref name="NAF1" /&gt; In 1979 he founded [[General Mediterranean Holding]] SA in [[Luxembourg]]. He was also Vice-Chair of the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] from 1996 and 2000.

He has been president of the Anglo Arab Organisation (AAO), since its founding in 2002. The AAO is a private non-profit making organisation, promoting the integration of British Arabs into mainstream British society, whilst retaining their identity. AAO's achievements include donating money to families affected by the earthquake in Pakistan in 2005, building a school in the earthquake-devastated town of [[Hoceima]], Morocco and hosting a charity gala that collected £35,000 in donations to the benefit of the Cancer Research Unit of the [[Kingston Hospital]] in London. Auchi and AAO have also led and sponsored high level delegations made up of Arab, British and French dignitaries, religious and political figures pressing for the release of hostages in Baghdad, including securing the release of two French journalists, Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot and their Syrian driver in 2004.

In 2007, Auchi, in collaboration with the [[American University in Cairo]] (AUC) announced the launch of the 'Nadhmi Auchi fellowship for young Arab leaders', a fellowship dedicated to the development of the abilities of Arab youth in institution management and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=22900|title=Auchi launches fellowship for young Arab leaders|work=Middle East Online|year=2007|accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auchi pays the full study and living costs of ten students from Egypt and other Arab states. The fellowship plan was announced during an annual ceremony at the Egyptian Embassy in London to celebrate AUC achievements.

==Honours and awards==
In 1996, the [[President of Tunisia]], [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]], made him an Officer of the Order of the Republic. In 2002, he was also awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of Independence by [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II of Jordan]].

In 2003, Auchi was made a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Royal Order of Francis I]] (GCFO) by [[Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro]], this in recognition of his major contributions to inter-church and inter-faith dialogue. In England, the [[College of Arms]] approved his [[English heraldry|Coat of Arms]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Newsletter/001.htm|title=The College of Arms Newsletter|publisher=The College of Arms|year=2004|accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the president of the [[Republic of Lebanon]], [[Émile Lahoud]], awarded Auchi with the Membership First Grade of the [[Order of Merit (Lebanon)|Lebanese Order of Merit]], having already appointed him as a Commander of the [[National Order of the Cedar]] in 2000. He was made a Knight of the [[Order of St. Sylvester]] (KSS) by Pope [[John Paul II]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constantinian.com/news-2004.html|title=The Grand Magistral Delegation for Inter Religious Relations|publisher=The Sacred Military Constantinian Order of St George|year=2008|accessdate=2008-11-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122055446/http://constantinian.com/news-2004.html|archivedate=2009-01-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Auchi was made Grao-Mestre da Ordem do Merito Anhanguera in Brazil and was elected as an Honorary Member in the [[International College of Surgeons]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois.

Auchi was awarded 'The Presidential Prize' in 2007 by the President of the American University in Cairo, this in appreciation of his efforts in supporting higher education in the Arab World.

On 18 July 2013, he was awarded the [[Freedom of the City of London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=17687 |title=City of London, Council Meeting Minutes, 18 July 2013 |publisher=Democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk |date=2013-07-18 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2014, Auchi was appointed a Knight Commander of [[Order of the Nation (Antigua and Barbuda)|the Most Distinguished Order of the Nation]] (KCN) of [[Antigua and Barbuda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ab.gov.ag/article_details.php?id=5041&amp;category=38 Official Website of the Government of Antigua and Barbuda]&lt;/ref&gt; This knighthood was later removed by the Governor General of Antigua following accusations around the circumstances in which it was given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3614462/Queen-s-envoy-honours-scandal-Title-given-Commonwealth-chief-s-crony-reviewed-amid-Palace-fury.html|title=Title given to Commonwealth chief's crony 'reviewed' amid Palace fury|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction for fraud==
In 2003, Auchi was convicted of fraud following his involvement in a $504 million corruption scandal centred on the French oil company [[Elf Aquitaine]], described as "the biggest political and corporate sleaze scandal to hit a western democracy since the second world war".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/nov/15/uk.economy "Corruption scandal hits senior politicians"]  ''The Guardian'' 23 Nov, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/nov/13/france.oilandpetrol "Gigantic sleaze scandal winds up as former Elf oil chiefs are jailed"] ''The Guardian'' 13 Nov, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Auchi was given a $2.8 million fine, along with a 15-month suspended jail sentence, for his involvement in the 1991 purchase by Elf Aquitaine of various Spanish oil refineries and petrol stations, having been accused by prosecutors of funneling $118 million of illegal commissions back to the Elf executives who had initially set up the deal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/07/france.oil "Oil scandal billionaire tells French court of bribes"] ''The Guardian'' 7 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the verdict, Elf (by now merged with TotalFina and renamed Total) decided to take legal action against Auchi in France; Auchi responded by suing Total for $327 million in turn, this time in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/unwelcome-publicity-for-oil-giant-in-legal-battle-with-billionaire-820750.html "Unwelcome publicity for oil giant in legal battle with billionaire"] ''The Independent'' 4 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6227">The '''new manufacturing economy''' (NME) describes the role of [[advanced manufacturing]] in the rise of the [[New Economy]]. The term describes [[manufacturing]] enabled by digital technologies, advanced systems and processes and a highly trained and knowledgeable workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tumulty |first=Brian |title=Skilled Manufacturing Workers in High Demand |work=USA Today |date=13 Nov 2005 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/robotics/2005-11-13-technical-worker-shortage_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new manufacturing economy integrates networks, 3D printers and other proficiencies into  business strategies to further develop manufacturing practices.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Chris |year=2008 |title=[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]] |location=New York |publisher=Hyperion |edition=Revised |isbn=978-1401309664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Friedman]] references [[Lawrence F. Katz]] that hubs of "universities, high-tech manufacturers, software/service providers and highly nimble start-ups"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Thomas L. | last=Friedman | title=The Next First (and Only) 100 Days  | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/opinion/sunday/friedman-the-next-first-and-only-100-days.html | work=[[The New York Times]]| date=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a needed economic development strategy. This is very similar to NME thoughts even though that exact term is not used.

==The Pillars of the new manufacturing economy==
===Technology===
Focus on geographic expansion, [[information technology]] and [[internet commerce]] are on the rise for industrial manufacturing companies according to the PricewaterhouseCooper Q4 2010 Manufacturing Barometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=PricewaterhouseCoopers |title=Manufacturing Barometer: Business Outlook Report – 4Q 2010 |date=Winter 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-21 |url=http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industrial-manufacturing/publications/manufacturing-barometer-4q2010.jhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such conditions compel companies to incorporate new technologies into business plans and to concentrate on the application of open-source product development in the creation of physical goods as a form of competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

New technologies influence various industries to emphasize [[innovation]] as a business tool .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dayberry |first=John |title=Manufacturing Solutions Center Prepares for Move to Conover |newspaper=[[Hickory Daily Record]] |date=15 Dec 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-12 |url=http://www2.hickoryrecord.com/news/2010/dec/15/all-about-jobs-ar-620232/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced manufacturing is feasible due to continuous improvement investments and modernization of the workforce, technologies and [[supply chains]] in order to increase global competitiveness, environmental sustainability and product customization to meet consumer expectations.

===Workforce===
Incorporating modern [[CNC]] equipment in new manufacturing processes requires better trained employees with more exacting skills than were previously required in heavy industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marano |first=Ray |year=2000 |title=Making Manufacturing Muscle |accessdate=2011-02-02 |publisher=New Century Careers |location=Pittsburgh |url=http://www.ncsquared.com/article00-0501.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past manufacturing job consisted largely of physical labor and worker [[assembly line]] requirements, but in response to technological evolution are becoming tech-savvy and information intense with focus on creativity and resourcefulness.

===Strategy===
The new manufacturing economy is centered around [[Niche market|"niche"]] businesses who satisfy the needs of small consumer markets by offering what customers want, when they want it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The primary foundation of this strategy is selling less of more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/20134 |title=Chris Anderson to Discuss New Manufacturing Economy |publisher=Dexigner |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adopting the efficiencies of digital and Web-based technologies into current business strategies is an emerging trend in manufacturing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Turbide |first=David |title=The Next Generation of ERP Software: Technology as a Means for Thriving in the New Manufacturing Economy |publisher=EPICOR |date=4 Oct 2004 |accessdate=2011-03-17 |url=http://downloads.vertmarkets.com/files/downloads/bf8ac2d2-1beb-4fc0-9645-cb8e9bb50633/next_generation_wp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industries===
Advanced technology in the manufacturing marketplace has led to growth in areas such as software development and biotechnology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kleszczewski |first=Mark |title=High-Tech Manufacturing: Down but Nowhere Near Out |journal=Global Corporate Xpansion |date=November 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-09 |url=http://www.gcxmag.com/gcx/article.asp?magarticle_id=770}}{{dead link |date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to emphasis on numerous [[industries]] such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Department of Governmental Relations |year=2009 |title=Indiana's New Manufacturing Economy Initiative |accessdate=2011-02-01 |url=http://www.purdue.edu/government/pages/budget/manufacturing.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720035035/http://www.purdue.edu/government/pages/budget/manufacturing.shtml |archivedate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Offshoring''' is the relocation of a [[business process]] from one country to another—typically an operational process, such as manufacturing, or supporting processes, such as accounting. Typically this refers to a [[company]] business, although state governments may also employ offshoring.&lt;ref&gt;"The Offshoring of American Government", Cornell Law Review, Nov. 2008, available: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1143044&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, offshoring has been associated primarily with the [[outsourcing]] of technical and administrative services supporting domestic and global operations from outside the home country ("[[offshore outsourcing]]"), by means of internal (captive) or external (outsourcing) delivery models.&lt;ref name="Papers.ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1287369 |title=SSRN-A Dynamic Perspective on Next-Generation Offshoring: The Global Sourcing of Science and Engineering Talent |authors=Stephan Manning, Silvia Massini, Arie Lewin |journal=[[Academy of Management Perspectives]]|volume=22|issue=3|pages=35–54|publisher=[[Social Science Electronic Publishing]]|date=October 20, 2008 |accessdate=|doi=10.5465/amp.2008.34587994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is in use in several distinct but closely related ways.  It is sometimes used broadly to include substitution of a service from any foreign source for a service formerly produced internally to the firm.  In other cases, only imported services from subsidiaries or other closely related suppliers are included.  A further complication is that intermediate goods, such as partially completed computers, are not consistently included in the scope of the term.&lt;ref&gt;See "Appendix II: Definitions of Offshoring" in General Accounting Office: "International Trade: Current Government Data Provide Limited Insight into Offshoring of Services", September 2004.  Imported intermediate goods are included in offshoring in "Swenson, D: "International Outsourcing", in ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offshoring can be seen in the context of either production offshoring or services offshoring. After its accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 2001, the [[People's Republic of China]] emerged as a prominent destination for production offshoring. Another focus area has been the [[software industry]] as part of global [[software development]] and developing [[global information system]]s. After technical progress in telecommunications improved the possibilities of [[trade in services]], [[India]] became one prominent destination for such offshoring, though many parts of the world are now emerging as offshore destinations.

The economic logic is to reduce costs, sometimes called [[labor arbitrage]], to improve corporate profitability. Jobs are added in the destination country providing the goods or services (generally a lower-cost labor country), but are subtracted in the higher-cost labor country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miszczynski|first=Milosz|date=2016-06-22|title=Labour arbitrage: the lifecycle of a global production node|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JOE-04-2016-0009|journal=Journal of Organizational Ethnography|volume=5|issue=2|pages=106–122|doi=10.1108/JOE-04-2016-0009|issn=2046-6749}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased safety net costs of the unemployed may be absorbed by the government (taxpayers) in the high-cost country or by the company doing the offshoring. Europe experienced less offshoring than the United States due to policies that applied more costs to corporations and cultural barriers.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569567-european-jobs-are-not-coming-back-because-few-them-went-first-place-staying-put|title=Staying put. European jobs are not coming back because few of them went in the first place|date=January 2013|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frequently used terms ==
Offshoring is defined as the movement of a business process done at a company in one country to the same or another company in another, different country. Almost always work is moved because of a lower cost of operations in the new location. More recently, offshoring drivers also include access to qualified personnel abroad, in particular in technical professions, and increasing speed to market.&lt;ref name="Papers.ssrn.com"/&gt; Offshoring is sometimes contrasted with [[outsourcing]] or [[offshore outsourcing]]. Outsourcing is the movement of internal business processes to an external organizational unit. Outsourcing refers to the process by which an organization gives part of its work to another firm / organization and makes it responsible for most of the applications as well as the design of the enterprise business process. This process is done under restrictions and strategies in order to establish consistency with the offshore outsourcing organizations. Many companies nowadays outsource various professional areas in the company such as e-mail services, payroll and [[call center]]. These jobs are being handled by other organizations that specialize in each sector allowing the offshoring company to focus more on other business concerns. However, subcontracting in the same country would be outsourcing, but not offshoring. A company moving an internal business unit from one country to another would be offshoring or [[physical restructuring]], but not outsourcing. A company subcontracting a business unit to a different company in another country would be both outsourcing and offshoring.

Related terms include [[nearshoring]], which implies relocation of business processes to (typically) lower cost foreign locations, but in close geographical proximity (e.g., shifting [[United States]]-based business processes to [[Canada]]/[[Latin America]]); inshoring, which means picking services within a country; and [[bestshoring]] or rightshoring, picking the "best shore" based on various criteria. [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) refers to outsourcing arrangements when entire business functions (such as [[Finance]] &amp; [[Accounting]], Customer Service, etc.) are outsourced.
More specific terms can be found in the field of software development - for example [[Global Information System]] as a class of systems being developed for / by globally distributed teams.

A further term sometimes associated with offshoring is [[bodyshopping]] which is the practice of using offshored resources and personnel to do small disaggregated tasks within a business environment, without any broader intention to offshore an entire business function.

=== Production offshoring ===
Production offshoring, also known as [[physical restructuring]], of established products involves relocation of physical manufacturing processes to a lower-cost destination. Examples of production offshoring include the manufacture of electronic components in [[Costa Rica]], production of apparel, toys, and consumer goods in China, [[Vietnam]] etc.

Product design, research and the development process that leads to new products, are relatively difficult to offshore. This is because research and development, in order to improve products and create new reference designs, require a skill set that is harder to obtain in regions with cheap labor. For this reason, in many cases only the manufacturing will be offshored by a company wishing to reduce costs.

However, there is a relationship between offshoring and patent-system strength. This is because companies under a strong patent system are not afraid to move work offshore because their work will remain their property. Conversely, companies in countries with weak patent systems have an increased fear of intellectual property theft from foreign vendors or workers, and, therefore, have less offshoring.

A major incentive for [[physical restructuring]] arrived when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) made it easier for manufacturers to shift production facilities from the US to [[Mexico]]. This trend later shifted to China, which offered cheap prices through very low wage rates, few [[workers' rights]] laws, a [[fixed currency]] pegged to the US dollar, (currently fixed to a basket of economies) cheap loans, cheap land, and factories for new companies, few environmental regulations, and huge [[economies of scale]] based on cities with populations over a million workers dedicated to producing a single kind of product. However, many companies are reluctant to move high value-added production of leading-edge products to China because of lax enforcement of intellectual property laws.&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, T: "China, Inc." Scribner, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; NAFTA has increased the velocity at which [[physical restructuring]] is occurring.

=== IT-enabled services offshoring ===
The growth of IT-enabled services offshoring is linked to the availability of large amounts of reliable and affordable communication infrastructure following the telecommunication and Internet expansion of the late 1990s. This was seen all the way up to the year 2000. Coupled with the digitization of many services, it was possible to shift the actual production location of services to low-cost countries in a manner theoretically transparent to end-users. Services include administrative services, such as finance and accounting, HR, and legal; call centers; marketing and sales services; IT infrastructure; application development; and knowledge services, including engineering support, product design, research and development, and analytics.

India first benefited from the offshoring trend, as it has a large pool of [[English language|English]] speaking people and technically proficient manpower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=cgirs Working Through Outsourcing: Software Practice, Industry Organization and Industry Evolution in India] Kyle Eischen. eScholarship Repository, 2006. Retrieved 25 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; India's offshoring industry took root in low-end IT functions in the early 1990s and has since moved to back-office processes such as call centers and transaction processing. This spawned the [[neologism]] ''Bangalored'', used to indicate a [[layoff]], often systemic, and usually resulting from corporate [[outsourcing]] to lower wage economies – derived from [[Bangalore]] in [[India]], where some of the first outsource centers were located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-ban1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Bangalored|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, India's low-cost labor has made it an offshoring destination for global firms like [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Accenture]], [[Intel]], [[AMD]], [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Cisco]] and [[SAP AG|SAP]].

Because of inflation, high domestic interest rates, robust economic growth and increased IT offshoring, the Indian IT sector has witnessed 10 - 15% wage growth in the 21st century. Consequently, Indian's operations and firms are concerned that they are becoming too expensive in comparison with competition from the other offshoring destinations. To maintain high growth rates, attempts have been made to grow up the value chain and diversify to other high-end work in addition to software and hardware engineering. These jobs include research and development, equity analysis, tax-return processing, radiological analysis, [[medical transcription]], and more.

The choice of offshoring destination is often made according to cultural concerns. Japanese companies are starting to outsource to China, where large numbers of Japanese speakers can be found—particularly in the city of [[Dalian]], which was Japanese-occupied Chinese territory for decades (this is discussed in the book ''[[The World is Flat]]''). German companies tend to outsource to [[Eastern Europe]]an countries, such as [[Poland]] and [[Romania]], where proficiency in German is common.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stephan |last=Manning |first2=Jörg |last2=Sydow |first3=Arnold |last3=Windeler |title=Securing Access to Lower-cost Talent Globally: The Dynamics of Active Embedding and Field Structuration |journal=Regional Studies |volume=46 |year=2012 |issue=9 |pages=1201–1218 |doi=10.1080/00343404.2011.571243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; French companies outsource to North Africa for similar reasons. For Australian IT companies, [[Indonesia]] is one of the major choice of offshoring destination. Near-shore location, common time zone and adequate IT work force are the reasons for offshoring IT services to Indonesia.

Other offshoring destinations include [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/news/technology/colombia-moves-towards-top-of-outsourcing-a-list-says-nearshore-americas|title=Colombia Moves Towards Top of Outsourcing A-List|work=BnAmericas|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], the [[Philippines]], [[South Africa]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an countries.

The [[Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) made [[nearshoring]] more attractive between the Central American countries of [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and the [[Dominican Republic]] and the US.

=== Innovation offshoring ===
Once companies are comfortable with services offerings and started realizing the cost savings, many high-tech product companies, including some in [[Silicon Valley]], started offshoring innovation work to countries like [[Colombia]], [[Belarus]], South Africa, India, China, Mexico, Russia and Ukraine. Accessing the talent pools in these countries has the potential to cut costs or even shorten product lifecycles. Developing countries like India are also involved in this practice.

When offshoring knowledge work, firms heavily rely on the availability of technical personnel at offshore locations. One of the challenges in offshoring engineering innovation is a reduction in quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moe|first=Nils Brede|last2=Šmite|first2=Darja|last3=Hanssen|first3=Geir Kjetil|last4=Barney|first4=Hamish|date=2013-08-29|title=From offshore outsourcing to insourcing and partnerships: four failed outsourcing attempts|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-013-9272-x|journal=Empirical Software Engineering|language=en|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1225–1258|doi=10.1007/s10664-013-9272-x|issn=1382-3256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to secure access to talent and possibly improve long-term quality, Western firms often establish collaborative relationships with technical universities abroad and thereby customize university programs to serve their particular needs. Examples include universities in Shanghai, such as [[Tong-Ji University]], where German firms and scholars co-sponsor labs, courses, and provide internships. Similar examples of collaborative arrangements can be found in Eastern Europe, e.g. Romania.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; Additionally, EU companies looking for IT innovation often setup collaboration with universities in countries such as Belarus and Ukraine, which have a high percentage of ICT graduates and overall a very skilled IT labor.&lt;ref&gt;Opportunities for EU ICT Actors.

===Re-shoring===

John Urry (distinguished professor of sociology at [[Lancaster University]]) argues that the concealment of income, the avoidance of taxation and eluding legislation relating to work, finance, pleasure, waste, energy and security may be becoming a serious concern for democratic governments and ordinary citizens who may be adversely affected by unregulated, offshore activities. Further, the rising costs of transportation could lead to production nearer the point of consumption becoming more economically viable, particularly as new technologies such as [[3D printing|additive manufacturing]] mature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Offshoring|author=John Urry|date=14 April 2014|isbn= 978-0745664866|publisher=polity UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer of intellectual property ==
Offshoring is often enabled by the transfer of valuable information to the offshore site. Such information and training enables the remote workers to produce results of comparable value previously produced by internal employees.  When such transfer includes protected materials, as confidential documents and trade secrets, protected by [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, then [[intellectual property]] has been transferred or exported.  The documentation and valuation of such exports is quite difficult, but should be considered since it comprises items that may be regulated or taxable.

== Debate ==
Offshoring has been a controversial issue spurring heated debates among economists, some of which overlap those related to the topic of [[free trade]]. It is seen as benefiting both the origin and destination country through [[free trade]], providing jobs to the destination country and lower cost of goods and services to the origin country. This makes both sides see increased [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).  And the total number of jobs increases in both countries since those workers in the origin country that lost their job can move to higher-value jobs in which their country has a [[comparative advantage]].

On the other hand, job losses and wage erosion in developed countries have sparked opposition to offshoring. Experts argue that the quality of any new jobs in developed countries are less than the jobs lost and offer lower pay.  Economists against offshoring charge that currency manipulation by governments and their central banks causes the difference in labor cost creating an illusion of comparative advantage.  Further, they point out that even more educated highly trained workers with higher-value jobs such as software engineers, accountants, radiologists, and journalists in the developed world have been displaced by highly educated and cheaper workers from India and China. On May 1, 2002, Economist and former Ambassador [[Ernest H. Preeg]] testified before the Senate committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs that China, for instance, pegs its currency to the dollar at a sub-par value in violation of Article IV of the [[International Monetary Fund]] Articles of Agreement which state that no nation shall manipulate its currency to gain a market advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest H. Preeg (May 1, 2002). [http://www.mapi.net/html/testimony2.html Testimony on Chinese Currency Manipulation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427064913/http://www.mapi.net/html/testimony2.html |date=2006-04-27 }} Manufacturers Alliance&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on jobs in western countries===
''The Economist'' reported in January 2013 that: "High levels of unemployment in Western countries after the 2007-2008 financial crisis have made the public in many countries so hostile towards offshoring that many companies are now reluctant to engage in it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring The Economist-Here, there and everywhere-January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2007 that while free trade among high-wage countries is viewed as win-win, free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/opinion/28krugman.html NYT-Paul Krugman-Trouble with Trade-December 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Two estimates of the impact of offshoring on U.S. jobs were between 150,000 and 300,000 per year from 2004-2015. This represents 10-15% of U.S. job creation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569568-offshored-jobs-return-rich-countries-must-prove-they-have-what-it-takes-shape The Economist-What to Do Now: Shape Up-January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased safety net costs of the unemployed may be absorbed by the government (taxpayers) in the high-cost country or by the company doing the offshoring. Europe experienced less offshoring than the U.S. due to policies that applied more costs to corporations and cultural barriers.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

The study also found that "offshoring increases real wages for both high- and low-skilled workers, but more so for the former, increasing inequality." 

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work &lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; highlights how offshoring can shape the demand for skills in receiving countries and explores how increasing automation can lead to [[reshoring]] of production in some cases.

===Legal implications in Japan===
Japanese companies use offshoring to exploit foreign laborers, particularly Chinese and Vietnamese, in violation of the Employment Security Act and Labor Standard Act guidelines set by the Japanese [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare]]. Article 44 of the Employment Security Act implicitly bans unauthorized companies supplying domestic/foreign workers, regardless of their operating locations. The laws apply if at least one party among suppliers, clients and workers reside in Japan, and if the workers are part of the integral part of the chain of command of the client company or the supplier:

{{Cquote|No person shall carry out a labor supply business or have workers supplied by a person who carries out a labor supply business work under his/her own directions or orders, except in cases provided for in the following Article.|Employment Security Act}}

{{Cquote|Unless permitted by act, no person shall obtain profit by intervening, as a business, in the employment of other|Labor Standards Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?yo=%E5%8A%B4%E5%83%8D%E5%9F%BA%E6%BA%96%E6%B3%95&amp;ft=2&amp;re=01&amp;ky=|title=日本法令外国語訳データベースシステム - [法令本文表示] - 労働基準法|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Employment Security Act sets punishment guidelines as follows:

{{Cquote|A person who falls under any of the following items shall be punished by imprisonment with work for not more than one year or a fine of not more than one million yen|Employment Security Act states, Article 64}}

Victims can lodge a criminal complaint against the CEO's of the suppliers and clients to the Labor Standards Inspection Office (in the case of the Labor Standards Act) or Public Prosecutor's Office in the company's location. Due to the risk of CEO's arrest, Japanese companies tend to privately settle with plaintiffs, offering between 20 and 100 million JPY (approximately 200,000 - 1 million USD) in damages.

== Effects of factor of production mobility ==
According to [[classical economics]], the three [[factors of production]] are [[land (economics)|land]], [[labor (economics)|labor]], and [[capital (economics)|capital]].  Offshoring relies heavily on the mobility of two of these factors.  That is, how offshoring affects economies depends on how easily capital and labor can be repurposed. Land, as a factor of production, is generally seen to have little or no mobility potential.

The effects of [[capital mobility]] on offshoring have been widely discussed.  In [[microeconomics]], a corporation must be able to spend [[working capital]] to afford the initial costs of offshoring.  If the state heavily regulates how a corporation can spend its working capital, it will not be able to offshore its operations.  For the same reason the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomy]] must be free for offshoring to succeed.  Generally, those who favor offshoring support capital mobility, and those who oppose offshoring call for greater [[regulation]].

Labor mobility also plays a major role, and it is hotly debated. When computers and the Internet made work electronically portable, the forces of free market resulted in a global mobility of work in the services industry. Most theories that argue offshoring eventually benefits domestic workers assume that those workers will be able to obtain new jobs, even if they have to obtain employment by downpricing themselves back into the labor market (by accepting lower salaries) or by retraining themselves in a new field. Foreign workers benefit from new jobs and higher wages when the work moves to them.

Offshoring faces criticism from labor scholars who argue that [[global labor arbitrage]] leads to unethical practices, connected to exploitation of workers, eroding work conditions and decreasing job security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miszczynski|first=M.|date=2016-02-18|title=Global Production in a Romanian Village: Middle-Income Economy, Industrial Dislocation and the Reserve Army of Labor|url=http://crs.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0896920515623076|journal=Critical Sociology|doi=10.1177/0896920515623076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the developed world, moving manufacturing jobs out of the country dates to at least the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;General Accounting Office: [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06423.pdf "Offshoring:  U.S. Semiconductor and Software Industries Increasingly Produce in China and India"], September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; while moving knowledge service jobs offshore dates to the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jom.2007.02.012|title=History of offshoring knowledge services|journal=Journal of Operations Management|volume=26|issue=2|pages=141|year=2008|last1=Metters|first1=Richard|last2=Verma|first2=Rohit}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued since then.  It was characterized primarily by the transferring of factories from the developed to the developing world. This offshoring and closing of factories has caused a structural change in the developed world from an industrial to a post-industrial service society.

During the 20th century, the decreasing costs of transportation and communication crossed with great disparities on pay rates made increased offshoring from wealthier countries to less wealthy countries financially feasible for many companies. Further, the growth of the [[Internet]], particularly fiber-optic intercontinental long haul capacity, and the [[World Wide Web]] reduced "transportation" costs for many kinds of information work to near zero.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |first=Sara |last=Baase |title=A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and The Internet |edition=Third |location=Harlow |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-13-600848-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of the Internet, many new categories of work such as call centres, computer programming, reading medical data such as X-rays and [[magnetic resonance imaging]], medical transcription, income tax preparation, and title searching are being offshored.

Before the 1990s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the EU. Because of Ireland's relatively low corporate tax rates, US companies began offshoring of software, electronic, and pharmaceutical intellectual property to Ireland for export. This helped create a high-tech "boom" and which led to Ireland becoming one of the richest EU countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 1994 the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) went into effect. As concerns are widespread about uneven bargaining powers, and risks and benefits, negotiations are often difficult, such that the plan to create free trade areas (such as [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]]) has not yet been successful. In 2005, offshoring of skilled work, also referred to as knowledge work, dramatically increased from the US, which fed the growing worries about threats of job loss.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Background==
Rami Makhlouf is related to the [[Assad family]] through his aunt, [[Anisa Makhlouf]], who was the wife of the late Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/world/meast/assad-family/index.html?iref=allsearch

==Business activities==
Rami Makhlouf is the main owner of [[Syriatel]], one of two licensed mobile phone companies in Syria. Besides Syriatel, he is involved in real estate, banking, free trade zones along the border with [[Lebanon]], [[duty-free shop]]s, and luxury department stores.&lt;ref name=Bar395/&gt; According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', he is thought to control as much as 60% of the Syrian economy through his web of business interests.&lt;ref name=ftpeel&gt;

Makhlouf was among a diverse group of connected insiders who monopolized the small, but growing, Syrian private sector in the 1990s. As President Hafez al-Assad prepared for his son's succession, the distribution of assets from privatization began to shift clearly in favor of the Makhloufs. Assad believed the [[Assad family#Anisa's siblings|Makhlouf family]] could be relied upon to support Bashar without reserve in the uncertain political environment that would follow upon his death, unlike other insiders, who had close financial ties to billionaire [[Lebanese Prime Minister]] [[Rafiq Hariri]], such as former Syrian Vice President [[Abdul Halim Khaddam]]. Rami and his brother Ihab therefore enjoyed easy access to opportunities such as an exclusive license to operate a network of duty-free retail shops, where a significant portion of goods were redistributed inside the country. By the time Bashar assumed power in 2000, Rami Makhlouf was well established.&lt;ref name=Gambil&gt;

Rami Makhlouf is thought to have tried in 2004 to take over the [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] concession in Syria, by ensuring passage of a law denying Mercedes the right to import parts unless Makhlouf was made the exclusive agent for Mercedes in Syria. Mercedes wanted to keep the Sankar family, who had had the concession since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;

Makhlouf's current business interests are extensive. He is the majority owner of Cham Holding which has investments in luxury tourism, restaurants, and real estate through [[Bena Properties]]. Cham Holding also controls [[Syrian Pearl Airlines]], the first private airline to be allowed in the country. He is also invested in several private banks established in Syria, such as the International Islamic Bank of Syria, [[Al Baraka Banking Group|Al Baraka Bank]], [[International Bank of Qatar]], [[Cham Bank]], and the Bank of Jordan in Syria; in insurance and financial services companies, such as Cham Capital. Like his father, Mohammed Makhlouf, he is active in the [[Economy of Syria#Energy|oil sector]], via the [[United Kingdom|British]] oil company Gulfsands Petroleum. He is also invested in real estate companies such as [[Sorouh Real Estate|Sourouh]], Fajr, Al Batra, and Al Hada'iq; in tourism companies such as Al Mada'in and in media companies such as the daily ''[[Al-Watan (Syria)|Al Watan]]'',&lt;ref name=dany&gt;

Makhlouf maintains a close relationship with [[Bushra al-Assad]], Bashar's older sister, and her husband [[Assef Shawkat]]. He also operates a number of business projects in Lebanon with [[Maher al-Assad]], Bashar's younger brother. There are reports of tensions between the two, which is thought to explain why parts of the Makhlouf business were shifted in 2005 to [[Dubai]]. Some observers believe the transfers were made because the Makhloufs were worried that they were going to be made the scapegoats of an anti-corruption propaganda campaign.&lt;ref name="Bar395"/&gt;

On 5 July 2012, it was reported that the Central Bank of the [[UAE]] ordered the banks and financial institutions to search for and submit details of any financial assets and transactions performed by the Syrian ruling elite, including Rami Makhlouf.&lt;ref name=khaleej512&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This search was based on the decision of the Ministerial Council of the [[League of Arab States]] dated 27 November 2011, to impose multiple sanctions on Syria, and on and decisions issued by the [[European Union]] and the United States involving economic sanctions on Syria.&lt;ref name=khaleej512/&gt;

==Accusations of corruption==
In February 2008, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] designated Makhlouf as a beneficiary and facilitator of public corruption in Syria. His influence and connections within the government have allowed him to control the issuance of certain types of profitable commodities contracts, it said.&lt;ref name="USTreasury" /&gt; According to the US Treasury, "Makhlouf has manipulated the Syrian judicial system and used Syrian intelligence officials to intimidate his business rivals. He employed these techniques when trying to acquire exclusive licenses to represent foreign companies in Syria and to obtain contract awards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makhlouf's brother [[Hafez Makhlouf]] was until 2014 head of Syria's intelligence agency, the [[General Security Directorate (Syria)|General Security Directorate]].

Political observers generally accept that Makhlouf's great wealth is a result of his close family ties to the Syrian government. It is reported that Bashar al-Assad before he became president would during official meetings try to make business contacts for Rami.&lt;ref name="Bar395" /&gt; In [[United States diplomatic cables leak|US diplomatic cables leaked]] by [[WikiLeaks]], Rami Makhlouf is described as a powerful government financer.&lt;ref name=USEmbassy&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makhlouf has further been accused of illegally diverting Lebanese telephone calls through Syria with the help of businessman Pierre Fattouch for the benefit of Syriatel.&lt;ref name="Bar395" /&gt;

Makhlouf controlled three Syrian companies close to the government of Bashar Al-Assad – Maxima Middle East Trading, Morgan Additives Manufacturing and Pangates International. These companies used Mossack Fonseca shell companies registered in the Seychelles and British Virgin Islands to ease the pressure global sanctions put on his cousin's regime. He paid for the [[Syrian Air Force]] helicopter fuel through shell companies, for example.&lt;ref name="AJSyria"&gt;{{cite news

Seif, a member of parliament and one of the most ardent critics of the Syrian government, became known outside of Syria because of his criticism of the government during the [[Damascus Spring]] of 2001. Despite several warnings from the Syrian government not to interfere, Seif began an anticorruption campaign in September 2001 against the way the two [[GSM]] mobile phone licenses were awarded, of which one to Maklouf's Syriatel. Shortly thereafter Seif lost his parliamentary immunity and was arrested and imprisoned for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

And they said, 'Oh, there is this bank who still does business with him, so we should still keep with him, as well'."

==Syrian Civil War==
{{Main|Syrian Civil War}}

Some opposition activists during the Syrian Civil War accused Makhlouf of financing pro-government demonstrations both across Syria and abroad, by providing flags, meals and money for those participating. The tycoon insisted his businesses are legitimate and provide professional employment for thousands of Syrians.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13216195|title=Bashar al-Assad's inner circle|date=18 May 2011|work=BBC|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ramón Areces Rodríguez''' (1904 in [[La Mata (Grado)]], [[Asturias]], [[Spain]] &amp;ndash; 1989 in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]).

At fifteen, Areces emigrated to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. There he learned the basics of the business working at EL ENCANTO Department Store. He later traveled through the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], before returning to Spain.  When he returned to Madrid in 1935, he opened up a small tailor shop on the ''calle Preciados''. Areces used the techniques he learned on his trip, and his business grew, quite unexpectedly. In July 1940 he opened the first [[El Corte Inglés]] [[department store]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

'''Robert Walton Goelet''' (March 19, 1880 &amp;ndash; May 2, 1941) was a [[financier]] and [[real estate developer]] in [[New York City]]. He was one of the largest property owners in the city by the time of his death.

==Life and career==
Robert Walton Goelet was born on March 19, 1880. His father, [[Robert Goelet]] (1841–1899), was a prominent landlord in New York. His mother was Henrietta Louise Warren. His uncle, [[Ogden Goelet]], was the builder of [[Ochre Court]] and his first cousin, Robert Wilson Goelet, was the original owner of [[Glenmere mansion]].&lt;ref name="glory"&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Chester Mansion Restored to Glory.

'''Saint Jacques Street''' (officially in {{lang-fr|'''rue Saint-Jacques'''}}), or '''St. James Street''', is a major street in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].

The street is commonly known by two [[street name|names]], "St. James Street" in [[English language|English]] (after [[St. James's]], [[London]]) and ''rue Saint-Jacques'' in [[French language|French]]. Both names are used in English and French, although Saint-Jacques is the most common for geographical reference. St. James Street is usually used in reference to the street's historic importance as a financial district.

==History==
[[File:DollierRuesMontreal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Montreal]] map drawn by [[François Dollier de Casson]] in 1672]]
A main thoroughfare passing through [[Old Montreal]], the street was first opened in 1672. The portion between McGill Street and place Saint Henri was originally called Bonaventure Street (''rue Saint-Bonaventure''). This name has passed down to [[Place Bonaventure]], [[Quebec Autoroute 10|Bonaventure Expressway]], and [[Bonaventure (Montreal Metro)|Bonaventure Metro station]], despite the disappearance of their original referents.

In the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, St. James Street was the centre of Montreal's financial district and where several major English insurance, banking, and trust companies built their Canadian head offices. Prior to [[World War I]], Canadian, provincial, and major municipal governments along with important industries such as the [[railway]]s, [[public utility]] and [[canal]] companies obtained most of their capital financing in the [[United Kingdom]] or the [[United States]]. At the end of the War, St. James Street grew rapidly and although by the 1920s there were [[stock exchange]]s in  [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Calgary]] and [[Vancouver]], St. James Street's [[brokerage firm|stock brokerage houses]] and the [[Montreal Stock Exchange]] were the most important in all of Canada. At the time of its construction in 1928, the [[Royal Bank of Canada]]'s [[Old Royal Bank Building, Montreal|new headquarters at 360 St. James Street]]  was the tallest building in the [[British Empire]]. The St James St. area was also the [[Bank of Montreal Head Office, Montreal|head office of the Bank of Montreal]], and the informal head office of the [[Bank of Nova Scotia]].  It was also home to the major brokerage houses such as [[Nesbitt, Thomson and Company]], [[Pitfield, MacKay, Ross]], [[Royal Securities Corporation]] and others.

Some companies, past and present, located on St. James Street are:

* 50 : [[Ottawa Hotel, Montreal]]
* 60 :  [http://www.canfone.com/ Canfone.com] - Versailles Building [http://www.imtl.org/montreal/building/Edifice_Versailles.php]

* 225 : National Trust Co.
* 231-235 : Montreal Star

* 262-266 : Montreal City and District Savings Bank
* 265 : [[Old Canadian Bank of Commerce Building, Montreal|Canadian Bank of Commerce]]

* 360 : [[Old Royal Bank Building, Montreal|Royal Bank of Canada]]
* 388-390 : Sovereign Bank of Canada then Union Bank and Commercial Union Assurance Co.
* 393 : Crown Trust Co.
* 437 : [[Eastern Townships Bank]] then the Commercial Union Assurance Co. and the [[Bank of Nova Scotia]]

East of [[Place d'Armes]] square, the street was home to two French-Canadian financial institutions, the [[Banque Canadienne Nationale]] and the [[Banque du Peuple]], long gone now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape15/eng/15text5a.htm Old Montreal Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
A steady erosion of its status as Canada's financial centre began with the opening of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959, followed by the political uncertainty as a result of the election of the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|separatist]] [[Parti Québécois]] provincial government in 1976, all served as a catalyst for financial institutions to locate elsewhere. A number chose to gradually move their official head offices to [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], while others shifted all future expansion to Toronto or other major Canadian centres. As a result, the St. James Street financial district has all but disappeared.

===Recent history===
[[File:Montreal - Sud-Ouest - Rue Saint-Jacques.jpg|thumb|right|Saint Jacques Street in [[Little Burgundy]]]]
During the 1990s, the [[Montreal Expos]] baseball club unveiled plans to build a new stadium in downtown Montreal, right off St. Jacques Street, just south of the [[Bell Centre]]. When provincial funding for the new building fell through, the Expos did not continue with their plan and sold the property to developers. That stretch of Saint Jacques is now undergoing considerable [[gentrification]].

Today, the stretch of St. Jacques Street between McGill Street and [[Saint Laurent Boulevard]] is still notable mostly for its grand [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] buildings on the part of the street running through the Old Montreal district. These include [[Bank of Montreal]]'s domed [[Bank of Montreal Head Office, Montreal|Montreal Main Branch]], the former headquarters of [[Royal Bank of Canada]], the [[Canadian Bank of Commerce]], the [[Molson Bank]] and the [[Canada Life Financial Corporation|Canada Life Insurance Company]]. More modern buildings include the [[Montreal World Trade Centre]] and the [[Tour de la Bourse|Stock Exchange Tower]].

Farther west, St. Jacques Street runs through the residential neighbourhoods of [[Little Burgundy]], [[Saint-Henri]], [[Notre-Dame-de-Grâce]] and [[Lachine, Quebec|Lachine]]. [[Lionel-Groulx (Montreal Metro)|Lionel-Groulx]] and [[Place-Saint-Henri (Montreal Metro)|Place-Saint-Henri]] Metro stations are located on St. Jacques in the [[South West]] borough; to the west, it gives access to [[Quebec Autoroute 20|Autoroute 20]] in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, where it passes through a largely industrial and large-surface commercial district at the top of the [[Falaise Saint-Jacques]]. The [[McGill University Health Centre]] superhospital will front Saint-Jacques in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2760">'''Secondary research''' involves the summary, collation and/or synthesis of existing research. Secondary research is contrasted with primary research in that primary research involves the generation of data, whereas secondary research uses primary research sources as a source of data for analysis.&lt;ref name=ithaca&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary and Secondary Sources|url=https://library.ithaca.edu/sp/subjects/primary|website=library.ithaca.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable marker of primary research is the inclusion of a "methods" section, where the authors describe how the data was generated.

Common examples of secondary research include [[textbooks]], [[encyclopedia]]s, [[news]] articles, [[review articles]], and [[meta analysis|meta analyses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ormsby|first1=Tim|title=Search Smart: Types of Research: Secondary Research|url=http://flinders.libguides.com/researchtypes/secondary|website=flinders.libguides.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrews|first1=Camille|title=LibGuides: Scholarly Literature Types: Primary vs. Secondary Articles|url=http://guides.library.cornell.edu/c.php?g=293669&amp;p=2004549|website=guides.library.cornell.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal methodology in health secondary research is the [[systematic review]], commonly using meta-analytic statistical techniques, but other methods of synthesis, like realist reviews and meta-narrative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9780727918697 Diffusion of Innovations in Health Service Organisations: a systematic literature review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202203417/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9780727918697 |date=2007-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reviews, have been developed in recent years. Such secondary research uses the primary research of others typically in the form of research publications and reports.

In a market research context, secondary research is taken to include the reuse, by a second party, of any data collected by a first party, such as telephone interviews or surveys.

'''Sexual harassment in the workplace''' in [[US labor law]] has been considered a form of [[sex discrimination|discrimination on the basis of sex]] in the United States since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="mcelroy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wendymcelroy.com/ifeminists/2004/1027.html|title=The Sad Evolution of Sexual Harassment|last1=McElroy|first1=Wendy|date=27 October 2004|website=iFeminists.com|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IhYip0PqV4EC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=lin+farley#v=onepage&amp;q=lin%20farley&amp;f=false|title=Directions in Sexual Harassment Law|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine A.|last2=Siegel|first2=Reva I.|publisher=Yale University|year=2004|isbn=0-300-09800-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two forms of sexual harassment recognized by United States law: [[Sexual harassment#Quid pro quo sexual harassment|quid pro quo sexual harassment]] (requiring an employee to tolerate sexual harassment to keep their job, receive a tangible benefit, or avoid punishment) and behavior that creates a [[hostile work environment]] (persistent sexual behavior that unreasonably interferes with an employee's ability to work). It has been noted that a number of the early sexual harassment cases were brought by [[African Americans|African American]] women and girls.

== History ==
The term "sexual harassment" was coined and popularized by [[Lin Farley]] in 1975, based on a pattern she recognized during a 1974 [[Cornell University]] class she taught on women and work.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt; It's been noted that a number of the original sexual harassment cases were on behalf of black women and girls.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIM88_WwJCsC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=williams+v.+saxbe+appeal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yatO7SUcs9&amp;sig=EEDntusmtqcqnq4GMPSeAHCXKgs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjM3bO98dvcAhXVCTQIHbMMDM84ChDoATAAegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=williams%20v.%20saxbe%20appeal&amp;f=false|title=Law, Gender, and Injustice: A Legal History of U.S. Women|last=Hoff|first=Joan|date=1994-04-01|publisher=NYU Press|year=|isbn=9780814744864|location=|pages=431|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States law recognizes two forms of sexual harassment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/employment/sexual_harassment.html|title=Sexual Harassment Law|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|date=10 January 2017|website=ExpertLaw|publisher=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Sexual harassment#Quid pro quo sexual harassment|Quid pro quo sexual harassment]]''': an employee is required to tolerate sexual harassment in exchange for employment, a raise or job benefit, or promotion.
*'''[[Hostile work environment]]''': sexual harassment in the workplace results in an offensive work environment or unreasonably interferes an employee's work performance.

=== Civil Rights Act of 1964 ===
In the US, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits [[employment discrimination]] based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], sex, color, [[national origin]] or religion. Initially only intended to combat sexual harassment of women, (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2) the prohibition of [[sex discrimination]] covers both females and males. This discrimination occurs when the sex of the worker is made as a condition of employment (i.e. all female waitpersons or male carpenters) or where this is a job requirement that does not mention sex but ends up preventing many more persons of one sex than the other from the job (such as height and weight limits). This act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Harassment|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm|website=EEOC|publisher=U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations (1980) ===
In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 

=== Civil Rights Act of 1991 ===
The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive [[damages]] for sexual discrimination or harassment

=== Case Law ===
==== ''Barnes v Train'' (1974) ====
''[[Barnes v. Train]]'' (1974) is commonly viewed as the first sexual harassment case in America, even though the term "sexual harassment" was not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/10/27/sad-evolution-sexual-harassment.html|title=The Sad Evolution of Sexual Harassment|date=2004-10-27|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paulette Barnes, an African American woman, was a payroll clerk who worked for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]. She brought the case after losing her job for refusing the advances of a male supervisor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peirce|first=Michelle Ridgeway|date=1989|title=Sexual Harassment and Title VII: A Better Solution|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1897&amp;context=bclr|journal=Boston College Law Review, Volume 30, Issue 4, Number 4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed, but was appealed in ''Barnes v Costle'' (1977).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== ''Williams v. Saxbe'' (1976) ====
In 1976, ''[[Williams v. Saxbe]]'' was the first case in a [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] to establish that [[quid pro quo]] sexual harassment constitutes sex discrimination under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. A male supervisor was found to have retaliated against [[Diane R. Williams]] by firing her after she refused to have sex with him. The court found that it was form of sex discrimination when a condition of employment is to submit to the sexual advances of a superior. Additionally, there was evidence that other female employees had been subjected to similar conditions. It was ruled that William B. Saxbe had only required women to submit to his advances, which created an artificial barrier to employment for one gender but not the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/413/654/1660985/|title=Williams v. Saxbe, 413 F. Supp. 654 (D.D.C. 1976)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-04/sexual-harassment-naming-it-paved-the-way-to-legal-victories|title=How Two Legal Cases Established Sexual Harassment as a Civil Rights Violation|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Williams v Saxbe'' established a clear-cut type of sexual harassment, [[quid pro quo]], and was the first to establish it in a [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]]. In response to the findings of this case, several earlier decisions against sex discrimination in lower courts were reversed on appeal, including ''Barnes v Train.'' &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== ''Barnes v. Costle'' (1977) ====
Although ''[[Barnes v. Train]]'' (1974) was initially dismissed, Paulette Barnes won on appeal in ''Barnes v. Costle'' (1977). During this case, the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] ruled it was sex discrimination for a woman to suffer tangible employment losses (for example losing her job) for refusing to submit to requests for sexual favors. The appeals ruling was based in part on the ''Williams v. Saxbe'' (1976) decision.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIM88_WwJCsC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=williams+v.+saxbe+appeal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yatO7SUcs9&amp;sig=EEDntusmtqcqnq4GMPSeAHCXKgs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjM3bO98dvcAhXVCTQIHbMMDM84ChDoATAAegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=williams%20v.%20saxbe%20appeal&amp;f=false|title=Law, Gender, and Injustice: A Legal History of U.S. Women|last=Hoff|first=Joan|date=1994-04-01|publisher=NYU Press|year=|isbn=9780814744864|location=|pages=431-432|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also found that companies are liable for not stopping sexual harassment if they know it is being conducted by supervisors.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As part of the ruling of ''Barnes v. Costle,'' Barnes received around $18,000 for back pay and the loss of promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wenzelfenton.com/blog/2018/01/01/history-sexual-harassment-laws-united-states/|title=History of Sexual Harassment Laws in the United States|date=2018-01-01|work=Wenzel Fenton Cabassa, P.A.|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson'' (1986) ====
In the 1986 case of ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'', the Supreme Court first recognized "sexual harassment" as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether the conduct was welcome and levels of employer [[legal liability|liability]], and that speech or conduct in itself can create a "[[hostile environment sexual harassment|hostile environment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source |case=''Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson'', 477 U.S. 57 (1986) |findlaw=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=477&amp;page=57 |justia=http://supreme.justia.com/us/477/57/case.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case filed by Mechelle Vinson ruled that the sexual conduct between the subordinate and supervisor could not be deemed voluntary due to the hierarchical relationship between the two positions in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53284947|title=Sexual harassment and the law : the Mechelle Vinson case|last=1946-|first=Cochran, Augustus B.,|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Kansas|isbn=0700613234|location=Lawrence, Kan.|oclc=53284947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ruling of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, reported sexual harassment cases grew from 10 cases being registered by the EEOC per year before 1896 to 624 case being reported in the subsequent following year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This number of reported cases to the EEOC rose to 2,217 in 1990 and then 4,626 by 1995.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== ''Ellison v. Brady'' (1991) ====
The case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' resulted in rejecting the [[reasonable person]] standard in favor of the "reasonable woman standard" which allowed for cases to be analyzed from the perspective of the complainant and not the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Profio|first1=Debra A.|title=Ellison v. Brady: Finally, a Woman's Perspective|journal=UCLA Women's Law Journal|date=1992|volume=2|issue=0|page=249|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3206643c|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== ''Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.'' (1991) ====
Also in 1991, ''[[Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.]]'' became the first sexual harassment case to be given [[class action]] status paving the way for others.

Seven years later, in 1998, through that same case, new precedents were established that increased the limits on the "[[Discovery (law)|discovery]]" process in sexual harassment cases, that then allowed psychological injuries from the [[litigation]] process to be included in assessing damages awards. 

==== ''Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida'', and ''Burlington v. Ellerth'' (1998) ====
In the same year, the courts concluded in ''Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida'', and ''[[Burlington v. Ellerth]]'', that employers are liable for harassment by their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=97-282 |title=U.S Supreme Court: Beth Ann Faragher, petitioner v. City of Boca Raton |publisher=FindLaw |date=June 26, 1998 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=97-569 |title=U.S. Supreme Court: Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth |publisher=FindLaw |date=June 26, 1998 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== ''Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services (1998)'' ====
Moreover, ''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services]]'' set the precedent for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of "sexual desire", stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable so long as it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser.

==== ''Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White'' (2006) ====
In the 2006 case of ''[[Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White]]'', the standard for retaliation against a sexual harassment complainant was revised to include any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.

==== ''Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.'' (2010) ====
The 2010 case, [[Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.|''Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.'']] ruled that a hostile work environment can be created in a workplace where sexually explicit language and pornography are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conte|first1=Alba|title=Sexual Harassment in the Workplace|date=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|isbn=9780735597655|pages=3–278|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Hostile work environment|hostile workplace]] may exist based upon the treatment of employees as a group, even if it is not targeted at any particular employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegar|first1=Kathryn W.|title=Modern Human Relations at Work|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0538481064|page=34|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
During 2007 alone, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and related state agencies received 12,510 new charges of sexual harassment on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmblegal.com/index.php/160/Sexual_Harassment_Law_A_Brief_Introduction_for_New_Practitioners|title=Sexual Harassment Law: A Brief Introduction for New Practitioners|last=Marshall|first=David|author2=Andronici, Justine|date=October 23, 2008|publisher=Katz, Marshall &amp; Banks|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 through 2016, men made approximately 17% of sexual harassment complaints filed with the EEOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charges Alleging Sex-Based Harassment (Charges filed with EEOC) FY 2010 - FY 2016|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/sexual_harassment_new.cfm|website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 MSN poll it was found that 31% of people in the U.S have been sexually harassed in the workplace; 45% of women said they were sexually harassed and 15% percent of men said they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sexual-harassment-affects-nearly-everyone-2017-11|title=Sexual harassment isn't a Hollywood, tech, or comedy world issue — in fact, it affects everyone|last=Gillett|first=Rachel|date=2017-11-10|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-11-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment in government===

The California legislature in Sacramento is known to have paid at least $850,000 in sexual harassment settlements in the period 1996-2017, though the [[New York Times]] notes often settlements are unknown to the public because of the terms of the settlements themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=JESS BIDGOOD|last2=MIRIAM JORDAN|last3=ADAM NAGOURNEY|title=Sexual Misconduct in California’s Capitol Is Difficult to Escape|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/us/sacramento-sexual-harassment-california.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=The New York Times|date=29 October 2017|quote=many harassment cases disappear into the court system, where the outcomes are often sealed as women sign nondisclosure agreements.

'''''Strategic Negotiations: A Theory of Change in Labor-Management Relations''''', a 1994 [[Harvard Business School Press]] publication, is a book on [[negotiation]] by the authors; [[Richard Walton]], Joel Cutcher-Gershenfeld, and Robert McKersie.&lt;ref name=SN-B-H-01/&gt;

The book explains concepts and strategies of negotiation to the reader.

==Summary==
In the book, the authors identify three primary [[negotiation]] [[strategies]]. These are "forcing," "fostering," and "escape".&lt;ref name=SN-B-H-02/&gt; Each represents an overarching pattern of interaction that characterizes the negotiations. A strategy does not emerge all at once, but over time as a result of consistent patterns of interaction.

A forcing strategy generally involves taking a "distributive" or [[Win-loss analytics|win-lose]] approach to the negotiations, combined with a "[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]" approach to internal relations in the other side, and an attitudinal approach that emphasizes uncertainty and distrust. By contrast, a fostering strategy generally involves taking an "integrative" or [[win-win strategy|win-win]] approach to the negotiations, combined with a "[[consensus]]" approach to internal relations in both sides, and an attitudinal approach that emphasizes [[openness]] and [[understanding]]. "Escape" is a non-negotiations strategy in which one or more parties seek to end or undercut the relationship, which leads to a [[loss-loss situation]].

These strategy and process elements of negotiations can be combined with an understanding of structure in order to predict outcomes that are both substantive and relationship outcomes.

The counter [[ion]] can be [[sodium]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) or [[ammonium]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).

==History==
The use of wood to make pulp for paper began with the development of [[mechanical pulp]]ing in [[Germany]] by [[F. G. Keller]] in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="eero"/&gt; Chemical processes quickly followed, first with [[Julius Roth]]'s use of [[sulfurous acid]] to treat wood in 1857, followed by [[Benjamin Chew Tilghman]]'s [[United States patent law|US patent]] on the use of [[calcium bisulfite]], Ca(HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to pulp wood in 1867.&lt;ref name="bier"&gt;{{cite book |last=Biermann |first=Christopher J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Essentials of Pulping and Papermaking |year=1993 |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |location=San Diego |isbn=0-12-097360-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost a decade later in 1874 the first commercial sulfite pulp mill was built in [[Sweden]]. It used magnesium as the counter ion and was based on work by [[Carl Daniel Ekman]].

By 1900 sulfite pulping had become the dominant means of producing wood pulp, surpassing mechanical pulping methods. The competing chemical pulping process, the sulfate or [[kraft process]] was developed by [[Carl F. Dahl]] in 1879 and the first [[kraft process|kraft mill]] started (in Sweden) in 1890.&lt;ref name="bier"/&gt;  The first sulphite mill in the United States was the Richmond Paper Company in [[Rumford, Rhode Island]] in the mid-1880s. The invention of the [[recovery boiler]] by [[G. H. Tomlinson]] in the early 1930s &lt;ref name="eero"&gt;{{cite book |author= E. Sjöström |title= Wood Chemistry: Fundamentals and Applications |publisher= [[Academic Press]]|year= 1993 |isbn= 0-12-647480-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed kraft mills to recycle almost all of their pulping chemicals. This, along with the ability of the kraft process to accept a wider variety of types of wood and produce stronger fibers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiapapermarket.com/history1.asp |title=History of Paper |accessdate=2007-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208203749/http://www.indiapapermarket.com/history1.asp |archivedate=2006-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; made the kraft process the dominant pulping process starting in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="bier"/&gt; Sulfite pulps now account for less than 10% of the total [[chemical pulp]] production&lt;ref name="bier"/&gt; and the number of sulfite mills continues to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=January 1997 |title=Swedish, German mills phase out sulfite |journal=Pulp and Paper |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3636/is_199701/ai_n8747040 |accessdate= 2007-10-08 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secinfo.com/drvzf.z35.htm|title=Wisconsin sulfite mill shuts down 2005|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steven  |last=Friederich |title=Living on borrowed time its whole life (Weyerhauser sulfite mill) |url=http://www.thedailyworld.com/articles/2006/09/25/local_news/01news.txt |work= |publisher=The Daily World |date=September 25, 2006 |accessdate=2007-10-08 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnesium was the standard [[counter ion]] until calcium replaced it in the 1950s.

==Processes involved in sulfite pulping==

===Pulping liquor preparation===
The pulping liquor for most sulfite mills is made by burning [[sulfur]] with the correct amount of [[oxygen]] to give [[sulfur dioxide]], which is then absorbed into water to give [[sulfurous acid]].

:S  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;#8652;  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Care must be taken to avoid the formation of [[sulfur trioxide]] since it gives undesired [[sulfuric acid]] when it is dissolved in water.

:2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →   2SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
:SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +   H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  &amp;#8652;  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

Sulfuric  acid is undesirable since it promotes hydrolysis of cellulose without contributing to delignification.

The cooking liquor is prepared by adding the counter ions as hydroxides or carbonates. The relative amounts of each species present in the liquid depend largely on the relative amounts of sulfurous used. For monovalent (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) hydroxides, MOH:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + MOH  → MHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:MHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + MOH  → M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

For divalent (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) carbonates, MCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:

:MCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  → M(HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:M(HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + MCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  → 2 MSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   +  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===Pulping===

Sulfite pulping is carried out between pH 1.5 and 5, depending on the counterion to sulfite (bisulfite) and the ratio of base to sulfurous acid. The pulp is in contact with the pulping chemicals for 4 to 14 hours and at temperatures ranging from 130 to 160 [[Celsius|°C]] (266 to 320 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]), again depending on the chemicals used.

Most of the intermediates involved in delignification in sulfite pulping are [[Resonance (chemistry)#Examples|resonance-stabilized]] [[carbocations]] formed either by protonation of carbon-carbon double bonds or acidic cleavage of ether bonds which connect many of the constituents of lignin. It is the latter reaction which is responsible for most lignin degradation in the sulfite process.&lt;ref name="eero"/&gt; The [[electrophilic]] carbocations react with bisulfite ions (HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)to give sulfonates.

:R-O-R'  + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  → R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  R'OH
:R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → R-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H

The sulfite process does not degrade [[lignin]] to the same extent that the [[kraft process]] does and the [[lignosulfonate]]s from the sulfite process are useful [[byproduct]]s.

===Chemical recovery===
The spent cooking liquor from sulfite pulping is usually called brown liquor, but the terms red liquor, thick liquor and sulfite liquor are also used (compared to [[black liquor]] in the [[kraft process]]). Pulp washers, using [[Countercurrent exchange|countercurrent]] flow, remove the spent cooking chemicals and degraded lignin and hemicellulose. The extracted brown liquor is concentrated, in [[Evaporator#Multiple-effect evaporators|multiple effect evaporators]]. The concentrated brown liquor can be burned in the [[recovery boiler]] to generate steam and recover the inorganic chemicals for reuse in the pulping process or it can be neutralized to recover the useful byproducts of pulping. Recent developments in [[Chemrec|Chemrec's]] [[black liquor gasification]] process, adapting the technology to use in the sulfite pulping process, could make [[second generation biofuels#Black liquor|second generation biofuels]] production an alternative to the conventional recovery boiler technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemrec.se/ Chemrec] web site&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1906 Gösta Ekström a Swedish engineer patented a process of ethanol generation from the residual 2-2.5% fermentable sugars in the spent liquor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaukoranta|first1=Antti|title=Sulphite alcohol industry in Finland in 1918-1978|date=1981|publisher=Paino Polar OY|location=Finland|isbn=951-9479-25-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sulfite process can use [[calcium]], [[ammonium]], [[magnesium]] or [[sodium]] as a base.

====Calcium-based====
The earliest process used calcium, obtained as inexpensive [[calcium carbonate]] and there was little incentive to recover the inorganic materials.

====Ammonia-based====
Ammonia-based processes do not allow recovery of the pulping chemicals since ammonia or ammonium salts are oxidized to [[nitrogen]] and [[nitrogen oxides]] when burned.

====Magnesium-based====
The recovery process used in magnesium-based sulfite pulping  the "Magnefite" process is well developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.p2pays.org/ref/10/09463.htm|title=Magnefite process|accessdate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concentrated brown liquor is burned in a recovery boiler, producing [[magnesium oxide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]], both of which are recovered from the flue gases. Magnesium oxide is recovered in a wet [[scrubber]] to give a [[wiktionary:slurry#Noun|slurry]] of [[magnesium hydroxide]].

:MgO  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O →  Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This magnesium hydroxide slurry is then used in another scrubber to absorb [[sulfur dioxide]] from the [[flue gases]] producing a magnesium bisulfite solution that is clarified, filtered and used as the pulping liquor.

:Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  Mg(HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

====Sodium-based====
Sodium-based processes use a recovery system similar to that used in the [[kraft process#Recovery process|kraft recovery process]], except that there is no "lime cycle".

==Applications==
The sulfite process is [[acidic]] and one of the drawbacks is that the acidic conditions [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] some of the cellulose, which means that sulfite pulp fibers are not as strong as kraft pulp fibers. The [[Crop yield|yield]] of pulp (based on wood used) is higher than for kraft pulping and sulfite pulp is easier to [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleach]].

===Commodity===
Sulfite pulp remains an important [[commodity]], especially for specialty papers and as a source of cellulose for non-paper applications. It is used to make [[coated fine paper|fine paper]], [[tissue paper|tissue]], [[glassine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paperonweb.com/grade11.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919044623/http://www.paperonweb.com/grade11.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-19 |title=Grades and uses of paper |accessdate=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to add strength to [[newsprint]].

===Dissolving pulp===
{{main|Dissolving pulp}}
A special grade of bleached sulfite pulp is known as ''dissolving pulp''&lt;ref name="diss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npchem.co.jp/english/product/dp/index.html|title=Dissolving pulp by the sulfite process|accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the raw material for a wide variety of cellulose derivatives, for example [[rayon]], [[cellophane]], [[cellulose acetate]] and [[methylcellulose]].

'''Rayon''' is a reconstituted cellulose fiber used to make many fabrics.

'''Cellophane''' is a clear reconstituted cellulose film used in wrapping and windows in envelopes.

'''Cellulose acetate''' was used to make flexible films for photographic use, computer tapes and so on and also to make fibers.

'''Methylcellulose''' and other cellulose ether derivatives are used in a wide range of everyday products from [[adhesives]] to [[baked goods]] to [[medication|pharmaceuticals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dow.com/methocel/index.htm|title=Applications for Methocel cellulose ethers from Dow Chemical|accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Byproducts==
Sulfite pulping is generally less destructive than kraft pulping, so there are more usable byproducts.

===Lignosulfonates===
Chief among sulfite process byproducts are [[lignosulfonates]], which find a wide variety of uses where a relatively inexpensive agent is needed to make a water dispersion of a water-insoluble material. Lignosulfonates are used in [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] leather, making [[concrete]], [[drilling mud]], [[drywall]] and so on.&lt;ref name="ligno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lignin.org/whatis.html |title=Uses of lignosulfonates |accessdate=2007-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009004745/http://www.lignin.org/whatis.html |archivedate=2007-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxidation of lignosulfonates was used to produce [[vanillin]] (artificial vanilla), and this process is still used by one supplier ([[Borregaard]], Norway) while all North American production by this route  ceased in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Other byproducts===
Acid hydrolysis of hemicelluloses during sulfite pulping produces [[monosaccharides]], predominantly [[mannose]] for softwoods and [[xylose]] for hardwoods,&lt;ref name="eero"/&gt; which can be fermented to produce [[ethanol]].

A '''teal organisation''' is an emerging organisational [[paradigm]] that advocates a level of [[consciousness]] including all previous [[world view]]s within the operations of an [[organization|organisation]]. The concept of teal organisation refers to the next stage in the evolution of [[consciousness]] and was introduced in 2014 by [[Frederic Laloux]] in his book on [[Reinventing Organizations]].&lt;ref name="lalouxfred-book"&gt;{{cite book  | title= Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness |url= http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/ | location = |last= Laloux   |first =  Frederic |date = 2014 | publisher = Nelson Parker |page= 381 |isbn= 978-2960133509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stratbusy&gt;{{cite web|title= The Future of Management Is Teal |url= https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00344?gko=10921 |website= Strategy + Business  |date= July 6, 2015  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also rests on previous studies done by [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] and [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] including [[Jean Gebser]], [[Clare W. Graves]], [[Don Edward Beck]], Chris Cowan and [[Ken Wilbur|Ken Wilber]] who explored the stages of development and impact of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarewgraves.com/articles_content/1974_Futurist/1974_Futurist.html "Human Nature Prepares for a Momentous Leap"], by Clare W.

== Overview ==
A teal organisation transcends and integrates the existing limitations of current static organisational paradigms including Amber, Orange and Green organisations.&lt;ref name=huffpost1&gt;{{cite news  |title= Reinventing Management, Part 1: What Color Is Your Organization?  |url=  https://www.huffingtonpost.com/great-work-cultures/reinventing-management-pa_b_9387286.html  |newspaper= [[HuffPost|Huffington Post]] |last=  Collins  |first= Rod   |date= March 4, 2016 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by three [[Epiphany (feeling)|breakthroughs]] in human [[collaboration]], specific to this evolutionary level: ''self-management'' suggests a system based on peer relationships with no need for hierarchy, consensus, nor central command and control; ''wholeness'' is about a consistent set of practices that invite members to reclaim their inner wholeness and bring on the workplace “all of who they are”;&lt;ref name=futureconsid1&gt;{{cite web |title= What does Wholeness mean in the context of Teal Organising? |url= https://futureconsiderations.com/wholeness-in-the-context-of-teal/  |website=  Future Considerations |date= July 7, 2015 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''evolutionary purpose'' introduces a teal organisation as a living [[organism]] with a direction of its own where its members are invited to listen and take note of the purpose it wants to serve. These breakthroughs overcome the limitations of  previous organisational models in that they welcome the emotional, intuitive, and spiritual elements in lieu of the usual display of rationality, determination and strength; and concealment of doubts or vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Most Dangerous Notion in "Reinventing Organizations"  |url=  https://medium.com/@jessicajprentice/the-most-dangerous-notion-in-reinventing-organizations-9032930295e2  |date= July 6, 2015 |publisher= [[Medium (website)|Medium Corporation]] |author= Jessica Prentice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During its evolution, a teal organisation exhibits properties similar to [[complex adaptive system]]s because the interactions and relationships between its elements are [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]] and based on few simple rules or guiding principles. These elements learn from the past and their immediate environment and then adapt accordingly for the survival of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Andersson |first= Malin|date= 2015 |title=Exploring the latest paradigm shift in organizational consciousness development, by using the framework from Reinventing Organizations |type= Master thesis|chapter= |publisher= |docket= |oclc= |url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.835.4680&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of notable organisations around the world has adopted and operates on the teal organisation model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  The Design Principles evolve "naturally" in the workplace and the need for a scientific foundation |url= https://www.prosocial.world/post/the-design-principles-evolve-naturally-in-the-workplace-and-the-need-for-a-scientific-foundation  |publisher= Prosocial World |date= June 2, 2017 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[The Morning Star Company]] (food processing, United States),&lt;ref name=morningself&gt;{{cite web|title= The Morning Star Company - Self-Management |url= http://morningstarco.com/index.cgi?Page=Self-Management  |website=  morningstarco.com |date=  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]]  (apparel, United States), [[Sounds True]] (media, United States), AES  (energy sector, international), [[Buurtzorg Nederland]] (health care, Netherlands), ESBZ ([[K–12]] school, Germany), Heiligenfelde  (mental health hospitals, Germany), [[Nucor]] (steel manufacturing, international).

A '''voluntary export restraint''' ('''VER''') or '''voluntary export restriction''' is a government-imposed limit on the quantity of some category of goods that can be exported to a specified country during a specified period of time. They are sometimes referred to as 'Export Visas'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OpqUoEMTB2wC|title=Export/Import Procedures and Documentation|last=JOHNSON|first=Thomas E.|last2=BADE|first2=Donna L.|date=2010-04-15|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|isbn=9780814415511|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically VERs arise when industries seek [[Protectionism|protection]] from competing imports from particular countries. VERs are then offered by the exporting country to appease the importing country and deter it from imposing explicit (and less flexible) [[trade barriers]].

==Characteristics==
VERs are typically implemented on exports from one specific country to another. VERs have been used since the 1930s at least, and have been applied to products ranging from [[textile]]s and [[footwear]] to [[steel]], [[machine tools]] and [[automobiles]]. They became a popular form of protection during the 1980s; they did not violate countries' agreements under the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in force. As a result of the Uruguay round of the GATT, completed in 1994, [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) members agreed not to implement any new VERs, and to phase out any existing ones over a four-year period, with exceptions grantable for one sector in each importing country.

Some examples of VERs occurred with automobile exports from [[Japan]] in the early 1980s and with textile exports in the 1950s and 1960s.

When the [[automobile industry in the United States]] was threatened by the popularity of cheaper more [[fuel efficient]] Japanese cars, a 1981 voluntary restraint agreement limited the Japanese to exporting 1.68 million cars to the U.S. annually as stipulated by U.S Government.&lt;ref&gt;Itō, Takatoshi. 1992. The Japanese Economy. MIT Press. 370&lt;/ref&gt; This quota was originally intended to expire after three years, in April 1984. However, with a growing deficit in trade with Japan, and under pressure from domestic manufacturers, the US government extended the quotas for an additional year.&lt;ref name=NYT84&gt;{{cite journal | title = About Cars; Chevrolet's Trio Challenge Imports | journal = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/25/sports/about-cars-chevrolet-s-trio-challenge-imports.html | date = 1984-11-25 | last = Schuon | first = Marshall }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cap was raised to 1.85 million cars for this additional year, then to 2.3 million for 1985. The voluntary restraint was removed in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |quote=In May 1981, with the American auto industry mired in recession, Japanese car makers agreed to limit exports of passenger cars to the United States. This "voluntary export restraint" (VER) program, initially supported by the Reagan administration, allowed only 1.68 million Japanese cars into the U.S. each year. The cap was raised to 1.85 million cars in 1984, and to 2.30 million in 1985, before the program was terminated in 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japanese automobile industry]] responded by establishing assembly plants or "transplants" in the United States (primarily in the Southern U.S. states where [[right-to-work law]]s exist as opposed to the Rust Belt states with established [[labor unions]]) to produce mass market vehicles. Some Japanese manufacturers who had their transplant assembly factories in the Rust Belt e.g. Mazda, Mitsubishi had to have a joint venture with a Big Three manufacturer (Chrysler/Mitsubishi which became [[Diamond Star Motors]], Ford/Mazda that evolved into [[AutoAlliance International]]). GM established [[NUMMI]] which was initially a joint venture with Toyota which later expanded to include a Canadian subsidiary ([[CAMI Automotive|CAMI]])) - a GM/Suzuki which were consolidated that evolved into the [[Geo (automobile)|Geo]] division in the U.S. (its Canadian counterparts Passport and Asuna were short lived - [[Isuzu]] automobiles manufactured during this era were sold as captive imports). The Japanese Big Three (Honda, Toyota, and Nissan) also began exporting bigger, more expensive cars (soon under their newly formed luxury brands like [[Acura]], [[Lexus]], and [[Infiniti]] - the luxury marques distanced themselves from its parent brand which was mass marketed) in order to make more money from a limited number of cars.
