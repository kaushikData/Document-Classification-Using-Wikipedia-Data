Hubbard had significant interests in [[dairy farming]], irrigation systems, finance and helicopters. He was one of three directors of Dairy Holdings Limited, which in 2007 owned 57 dairy units, and 10 grazing blocks in the South Island. In the 2006-07 season Dairy Holdings Limited milked 44,000 cows on 16,120 hectares and produced 14.3 million kg of milksolids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ruralnews.co.nz/Default.asp?task=article&amp;subtask=show&amp;item=13423&amp;pageno=1 |title=Corporate farmers’ formidable dairy holding |newspaper=Rural News |publisher= |accessdate=26 June 2010 |date=7 October 2007 |first=Heather |last=Chalmers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525191332/http://www.ruralnews.co.nz/Default.asp?task=article&amp;subtask=show&amp;item=13423&amp;pageno=1 |archivedate=25 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Allan Hubbard was born in 1928 in [[Dunedin]]. His parents lived with five children in a three-bedroom [[Dunedin North]] cottage with no electric lighting. In the Depression, his father was unemployed plumber who had to plant pine seedlings on a work scheme. Hubbard's first job was on a [[Taieri Plains]] dairy farm. He then worked as a clerk for Trustees Executors while studying part-time for his School Certificate, University Entrance and an accountancy degree from the universities of [[Otago]] and [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]].  In 1953, he and Jean Hubbard, who had been a fellow student at Otago, moved to [[Timaru]] where he did bookkeeping for the Craighead school while establishing the accounting firm Hubbard Churcher. In the mid-1950s he provided the backing for Doug Shears and Helicopters New Zealand Ltd. Also in the 1950s, Hubbard gained control of [[South Canterbury Finance]], a small-time lender to local businesses and households. In 1962 Hubbard bought a dairy farm.&lt;ref name='macfie1'&gt;{{cite web

==South Canterbury Finance==
In 1926, [[South Canterbury Finance]] Ltd started as a small-time lender to local businesses and households in [[Timaru]].&lt;ref name='Vaughan'&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard was considered the driving force behind the company's growth as it ultimately became the largest financial institution in the [[South Island]] of New Zealand. By the late 2000s, South Canterbury Finance had 35,000 investors and its assets were considered to be worth almost $NZ2 billion. South Canterbury Finance owned 13 companies including fruit packaging and warehousing company Scales Corporation, helicopter and tourism business Helicopters NZ, and a third shareholding in Dairy Holdings Limited, New Zealand's largest dairy farming group.&lt;ref name='Vaughan'/&gt;

Despite its reputation as a South Island rural lender, South Canterbury Finance made loans to property development throughout New Zealand, Australia and Fiji. At 30 June 2009, property loans were $414.2 million. Real estate lending represented 207 loans with an average net loan value of $1.15 million. Further, 37 per cent of lending was secured by a second or lower ranking mortgages. There were ten property loans greater than $10 million. For some lending, the interest was capitalised into the loan debt, so borrowers did not have to immediately fund interest payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 31 August 2010, South Canterbury Finance asked its trustee to place it in [[receivership]] after negotiations over a recapitalisation deal failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Alan Hubbard was reported blaming the Government and the other South Canterbury Finance directors for the receivership: as the directors had sidelined him and the Government had placed him in statutory management.&lt;ref name='speaks' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Vaughan'/&gt;

On 7 December 2011, the [[Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)|Serious Fraud Office]] laid 21 charges against five individuals in respect of South Canterbury Finance. The charges related to a variety of allegedly fraudulent transactions which had a total estimated value of approximately $1.7 billion. This included an estimated $1.58 billion from the Crown Retail Deposits Guarantee Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The alleged offences included theft by a person in a special relationship, obtaining by deception, false statements by a promoter of a company and false accounting. All five defendants denied the charges. A date of Monday May 28, 2012 was set for a post committal conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/197574/scf-fraud-accused-all-named

==Statutory management==
On 20 June 2010, the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|New Zealand Government]] placed Allan Hubbard, his wife Jean Hubbard and his business Aorangi Securities and seven charitable trusts into statutory management, with Trevor Thornton and Richard Simpson of [[Grant Thornton New Zealand Limited]] appointed as statutory managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://beehive.govt.nz/release/aorangi+securities+charitable+trusts+and+hubbards+placed+statutory+management |title=Beehive - Aorangi Securities, charitable trusts, and Hubbards placed into statutory management |publisher=New Zealand Government |date=20 June 2010 |accessdate=23 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922095152/http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/aorangi%2Bsecurities%2Bcharitable%2Btrusts%2Band%2Bhubbards%2Bplaced%2Bstatutory%2Bmanagement |archivedate=22 September 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This decision was based on recommendations from the [[Securities Commission of New Zealand]] after a complaint from an investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/serious-fraud-office/news/article.cfm?o_id=371&amp;objectid=10653246 |title=SFO to investigate Hubbards |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |author= |date=20 June 2010  |accessdate=21 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allan Hubbard established Aorangi Securities Limited in 1974. The directors were Allan and Margaret Hubbard and the share capital was owned by another Hubbard-owned company, Forresters Nominee Company Limited. Aorangi had operated as a finance company, having raised $98 million from  407 investors living in Otago and Canterbury and making loans of approximately $134 million to borrowers.

In July 2010, the Statutory Managers reported that Allan Hubbard also controlled an additional business that they had not been aware of when appointed. This was Hubbard Funds Management, an investment management business estimated to be worth $70 million. It had inadequate accounting records consisting of a hand written cashbook and journals maintained by Mr Hubbard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Two other assessments of the statutory management were also released in September 2011. On 6 September 2011, Kerry Grass released a report to the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.scoop.co.nz/2011/09/06/allan-hubbard-investigation-summary-by-kerry-grass/ | title=Allan Hubbard – Investigation Summary by Kerry Grass | publisher=[[Scoop Media]] | work=Business Scoop | date=September 6, 2011 | accessdate=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businessman Tur Borren also provided a report on the statutory management.&lt;ref&gt;Independent Report in to the Statutory Management  in September 2011 https://www.scribd.com/doc/64311081/Hubbard-Report&lt;/ref&gt;

After an independent review of the statutory management organised by the Registrar of Companies, Jean Hubbard was released from statutory management on 11 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In May 2012, Statutory Managers Grant Thornton New Zealand Limited reported that investors in Hubbard Management Funds were owed $82 million, and the fund was valued at $44.8m. Grant Thornton asked the High Court to decide how to distribute the fund given the lack of a prospectus and given that the 'largely fictional' investor statements had not been reconciled to investment assets for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In October 2015, Statutory Managers Grant Thornton reported paying out 99% of the money investors put into Aorangi Securities Limited, and all of the money originally put in by investors to Hubbard Management Funds. This led critics to question whether statutory management had been necessary or if the right approach had been taken by the statutory managers during their period of administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Ayelet Gneezy''' (born August 25, 1966) is an associate professor of marketing at the [[Rady School of Management]], UC San Diego.

==Education and career==
Gneezy obtained her MBA at the [[University of Teesside]] joint with the [[Haagse Hogeschool]]. She went on to manage the strategic planning department in DataPro Proximity (a subsidiary of [[BBDO]]) in Israel, before receiving her PhD in [[marketing]] at the [[University of Chicago Graduate School of Business]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/ayelet-gneezy/&lt;/ref&gt;

Gneezy teaches [[marketing communications]], [[social entrepreneurship]] and [[consumer behavior]] to MBA students at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

==Research==
Gneezy's research addresses various questions regarding consumer behavior, including social preferences, prosocial behavior, behavioral pricing, and factors influencing quality of life for individuals. She collaborates with both small and large firms and integrates field experiments in order to answer this questions.

In a 2010 study,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5989/325.full&lt;/ref&gt; Gneezy and coauthors worked with [[Disney Research]] to study a behavioral pricing approach called [[pay-what-you-want]] at an amusement park. In a large-scale field experiment, they sold people souvenir photos from a ride at the park under four conditions. In the first of these, the photos were priced at the regular $12.95; about 0.5% (1 in 200) of people bought a photo in this condition. In the second condition, the price stayed the same but consumers were told that half of the proceeds would go to charity, which resulted in about 0.57% of people buying the photos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/jul/29/tp-professor-naming-own-price-can-be-a-success/&lt;/ref&gt; The third condition allowed people to pay what they want for the photos, which resulted in 16 times more sales, but at prices so low that they were unsustainable. In the final condition, Gneezy and her coauthors offered the consumers the option to pay what they want and told them half of the proceeds would go to charity. The results of the final condition were astonishing; the amusement park profited significantly from this condition, along with a considerable amount of money being raised for the charity. This demonstrated what Gneezy and her colleagues refer to as "shared social responsibility" – the idea that involving the consumer in the pricing of goods and the choice of contributions increases the benefit to both the consumers and the company.

The results of this study received widespread media attention and have inspired many more studies and experiments. Gneezy and coauthors are credited for playing a major role as pioneers in pay-what-you-want research. They won the 2012 Society for Personality and Social Psychology Robert B. Cialdini Award for excellence in a published field study.

==Personal life==
Gneezy lives with her husband and three children in [[San Diego]], California.

{{Bookkeeping}}[[File:Pacioli.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Portrait of the Italian [[Luca Pacioli]]'', painted by [[Jacopo de' Barbari]], 1495, ([[Museo di Capodimonte]]). Pacioli is regarded as the Father of Accounting.]]
'''Bookkeeping''' is the recording of financial transactions, and is part of the process of [[accounting]] in [[business]].&lt;ref name="Weygandt, Kieso, Kimmel (2003)"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weygandt |author2=Kieso |author3=Kimmel |title=Financial Accounting|year=2003|publisher=Susan Elbe|isbn=0-471-07241-9|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transactions include purchases, sales, receipts, and payments by an individual person or an organization/corporation. There are several standard methods of bookkeeping, such as the [[single-entry bookkeeping system]] and the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]], but, while they may be thought of as "real" bookkeeping, any process that involves the recording of financial transactions is a bookkeeping process.

Bookkeeping is usually performed by a '''bookkeeper'''. A bookkeeper (or book-keeper) is a person who records the day-to-day financial transactions of a business. They are usually responsible for writing the ''daybooks'', which contain records of purchases, sales, receipts, and payments. The bookkeeper is responsible for ensuring that all transactions whether it is cash transaction or credit transaction are recorded in the correct daybook, supplier's ledger, customer ledger, and [[general ledger]]; an accountant can then create reports from the information concerning the financial transactions recorded by the bookkeeper.

Bookkeeping refers mainly to the record-keeping aspects of accounting. Bookkeeping involves preparing source documents for all transactions, operations, and other events of the business. 

The bookkeeper brings the books to the [[trial balance]] stage: an accountant may prepare the [[income statement]] and [[balance sheet]] using the trial balance and ledgers prepared by the bookkeeper.

== History ==
The origin of book-keeping is lost in obscurity, but recent researches would appear to show that some method of keeping accounts has existed from the remotest times. Babylonian records have been found dating back as far as 2600 B.C., written with a stylus on small slabs of clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Book-Keeping|volume=4|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The term "waste book" was used in colonial America referring to bookkeeping. The purpose was to document daily transactions including receipts and expenditures. This was recorded in chronological order, and the purpose was for temporary use only. The daily transactions would then be recorded in a daybook or account ledger in order to balance the accounts. The name "waste book" comes from the fact that once the waste book's data were transferred to the actual journal, the waste book could be discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= Guides to Archives and Manuscript Collections at the University of Pittsburgh Library System |title= Pittsburgh Waste Book and Fort Pitt Trading Post Papers |url= http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=General%20John%20Forbes;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-dar192503 |access-date= 2015-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===
The bookkeeping process primarily records the ''financial effects'' of transactions. The difference between a manual and any electronic accounting system results from the former's [[latency (engineering)]] between the recording of a financial transaction and its posting in the relevant account. This delay—absent in electronic accounting systems due to nearly instantaneous posting into relevant accounts—is a basic characteristic of manual systems, thus giving rise to primary books of accounts such as Cash Book, Bank Book, Purchase Book, and Sales Book for recording the immediate effect of a financial transaction.

In the normal course of business, a document is produced each time a transaction occurs. Sales and purchases usually have [[invoice]]s or [[receipt]]s. Deposit slips are produced when lodgements (deposits) are made to a [[bank account]]. Checks (spelled "cheques" in the UK and several other countries) are written to pay money out of the account. Bookkeeping first involves recording the details of all of these ''source documents'' into multi-column ''journals'' (also known as ''books of first entry'' or ''daybooks''). For example, all credit sales are recorded in the sales journal; all cash payments are recorded in the cash payments journal. Each column in a journal normally corresponds to an account. In the [[single-entry accounting system|single entry system]], each transaction is recorded only once. Most individuals who balance their check-book each month are using such a system, and most personal-finance software follows this approach.

After a certain period, typically a month, each column in each [[Journal entry|journal]] is totalled to give a summary for that period. Using the rules of double-entry, these journal summaries are then transferred to their respective accounts in the [[ledger]], or ''account book''. For example, the entries in the Sales Journal are taken and a debit entry is made in each customer's account (showing that the customer now owes us money), and a credit entry might be made in the account for "Sale of class 2 widgets" (showing that this activity has generated revenue for us). This process of transferring summaries or individual transactions to the ledger is called  ''posting''. Once the posting process is complete, accounts kept using the "T" format undergo ''balancing'', which is simply a process to arrive at the balance of the account.

As a partial check that the posting process was done correctly, a working document called an ''unadjusted trial balance'' is created. In its simplest form, this is a three-column list. Column One contains the names of those accounts in the [[ledger]] which have a non-zero balance. If an account has a ''debit'' balance, the balance amount is copied into Column Two (the ''debit column''); if an account has a ''credit'' balance, the amount is copied into Column Three (the ''credit column''). The debit column is then totalled, and then the credit column is totalled. The two totals must agree—which is not by chance—because under the double-entry rules, whenever there is a posting, the debits of the posting equal the credits of the posting. If the two totals do not agree, an error has been made, either in the journals or during the posting process. The error must be located and rectified, and the totals of the debit column and the credit column recalculated to check for agreement before any further processing can take place.

Once the accounts balance, the accountant makes a number of adjustments and changes the balance amounts of some of the accounts. These adjustments must still obey the double-entry rule: for example, the ''[[inventory]]'' account and asset account might be changed to bring them into line with the actual numbers counted during a stocktake. At the same time, the ''expense'' account associated with usage of inventory is adjusted by an equal and opposite amount. Other adjustments such as posting [[depreciation]] and prepayments are also done at this time. This results in a listing called the ''adjusted trial balance''. It is the accounts in this list, and their corresponding debit or credit balances, that are used to prepare the financial statements.

Finally [[financial statement]]s are drawn from the trial balance, which may include:
* the [[income statement]], also known as the ''statement of financial results'', ''profit and loss account'', or ''P&amp;L''
* the [[balance sheet]], also known as the ''statement of financial position''
* the [[cash flow statement]]
* the [[Statement of changes in equity]], also known as the ''statement of total recognised gains and losses''

== Entry systems ==
Two common bookkeeping systems used by businesses and other organizations are the [[single-entry bookkeeping system]] and the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]]. Single-entry bookkeeping uses only income and expense [[Account (accountancy)|account]]s, recorded primarily in a revenue and expense journal. Single-entry bookkeeping is adequate for many small businesses. In the double-entry accounting system, at least two accounting entries are required to record each financial transaction. These entries may occur in asset, liability, equity, expense, or revenue accounts.

===Single-entry system===
{{main article|single-entry bookkeeping system}}
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Please remember that this is a summary of sedhf ksnvd  topic covered in the article on single-entry bookkeeping. --&gt;

The primary bookkeeping record in single-entry bookkeeping is the ''cash book'', which is similar to a checking account (UK: cheque account, current account) register, but allocates the income and expenses to various income and expense accounts. Separate account records are maintained for petty cash, accounts payable and receivable, and other relevant transactions such as [[inventory]] and travel expenses. These days, single-entry bookkeeping can be done with [[DIY]] bookkeeping software to speed up manual calculations.

===Double-entry system===
{{main article|double-entry bookkeeping system}}
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Please remember that this is a summary of the topic covered in the article on double-entry bookkeeping. --&gt;

A ''double-entry bookkeeping system'' is a set of rules for recording financial information in a [[financial accounting]] system in which every transaction or event changes at least two different nominal [[ledger]] accounts.

==Daybooks==
A ''daybook'' is a descriptive and chronological (diary-like) record of day-to-day [[financial transactions]] also called a ''book of original entry''. The daybook's details must be entered formally into journals to enable posting to ledgers. Daybooks include:

*Sales daybook, for recording all the sales invoices.
*Sales credits daybook, for recording all the sales credit notes.
*Purchases daybook, for recording all the purchase invoices.
*Purchases Debits daybook, for recording all the purchase Debit notes.
*Cash daybook, usually known as the cash book, for recording all money received as well as money paid out. It may be split into two daybooks: receipts daybook for money received in, and payments daybook for money paid out.
*General Journal daybook, for recording journals.

==Petty cash book==
A ''[[petty cash]]'' book is a record of small-value purchases before they are later transferred to the ledger and final accounts; it is maintained by a petty or junior cashier. This type of cash book usually uses the [[imprest system]]: a certain amount of money is provided to the petty cashier by the senior cashier. This money is to cater for minor expenditures (hospitality, minor stationery, casual postage, and so on) and is reimbursed periodically on satisfactory explanation of how it was spent.

==Journals==
''[[Journal entry|Journals]]'' are recorded in the general journal daybook. A journal is a formal and chronological record of [[financial transactions]] before their values are accounted for in the general ledger as [[debits and credits]]. A company can maintain one journal for all transactions, or keep several journals based on similar activity (e.g., sales, cash receipts, revenue, etc.), making transactions easier to summarize and reference later. For every [[debits and credits|debit]] journal entry recorded, there must be an equivalent [[debits and credits|credit]] journal entry to maintain a balanced accounting equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Haber | first = Jeffry | title = Accounting Demystified | publisher = AMACOM | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8144-0790-0 | page = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ledgers==
A ''[[ledger]]'' is a record of [[Account (accountancy)|accounts]].The ledger is a permanent summary of all amounts entered in supporting Journals which list individual transactions by date. These accounts are recorded separately, showing their beginning/ending [[Balance (accounting)|balance]]. A journal lists [[financial transactions]] in chronological order, without showing their balance but showing how much is going to be charged in each account. A ledger takes each financial transaction from the journal and records it into the corresponding account for every transaction listed. The ledger also sums up the total of every account, which is transferred into the [[balance sheet]] and the [[income statement]]. There are three different kinds of ledgers that deal with book-keeping:
*Sales ledger, which deals mostly with the accounts receivable account. This ledger consists of the records of the financial transactions made by customers to the business.
*Purchase ledger is the record of the purchasing transactions a company does; it goes hand in hand with the Accounts Payable account.

==Abbreviations used in bookkeeping==
* A/C – Account
* Acc – Account
* A/R – Accounts receivable
* A/P – Accounts payable
* B/S – Balance sheet
* c/d – Carried down
* b/d – Brought down
* c/f – Carried forward
* b/f – Brought forward
* Dr – Debit side of a ledger. "Dr" stands for "'''D'''ebit '''r'''egister"
* Cr – Credit side of a ledger. "Cr" stands for "'''C'''redit '''r'''egister"
* G/L – General ledger; (or N/L – nominal ledger)
* PL – Profit and loss; (or I/S – income statement)
* P/R - Payroll
* PP&amp;E – Property, plant and equipment
* TB – Trial Balance
* GST – [[Goods and Services Tax (disambiguation)|Goods and services tax]]
* VAT – [[Value added tax]]
* CST – Central sale tax
* TDS – Tax deducted at source
* AMT – Alternate minimum tax
* EBITDA – Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation
* EBDTA – Earnings before depreciation, taxes and amortisation
* EBT – Earnings before tax
* EAT – Earnings after tax
* PAT – Profit after tax
* PBT – Profit before tax
* Depr – Depreciation
* Dep – Depreciation
* CPO – Cash paid out
* CP - Cash Payment
*

==Chart of accounts==
A [[chart of accounts]] is a list of the [[Account (accountancy)|accounts]] codes that can be identified with numeric, alphabetical, or alphanumeric codes allowing the account to be located in the general ledger. The equity section of the chart of accounts is based on the fact that the legal structure of the entity is of a particular legal type. Possibilities include ''sole trader'', ''partnership'', ''trust'', and ''company''.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden,Stephen (2008). Australian Master Bookkeepers Guide. Sydney: CCH {{ISBN|978-1-921593-57-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computerized bookkeeping==
Computerized bookkeeping removes many of the paper "books" that are used to record the financial transactions of an entity—instead, relational databases take their place, but they still typically enforce the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]] and methodology. [[Certified Public Accountant|CPAs]] design the internal controls for the computerized bookkeeping system, which serve to minimize errors in documenting the big number of activities that the entity engages in over the period.

'''''Business Centre Australia''''' was once one of [[CNBC Asia]]'s business news shows to round-up the trading day in Australia.  During its debut in late January 2001, it initially aired only to viewers on CNBC Asia's Australian feed but later that year it was made available across the region.  The show was presented by [[Amanda Drury]] from Singapore and [[Mark Laudi]] from Sydney although Laudi eventually moved back to Singapore and co-hosted the show there.

'''Compulsory arbitration''' is [[arbitration]] of [[labour (economics)|labor disputes]] which [[law]]s of some communities force the two sides, labor and [[management]], to undergo. These laws mostly apply when the possibility of a [[Strike action|strike]] seriously affects the [[public interest]]. Some labor [[contract]]s make specific provisions for compulsory arbitration should the two sides fail to reach agreement through the regular system of [[collective bargaining]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/SuperiorCourt/CivilDepartment/Arbitration/index.asp Arbitration Guide]. The Superior Court of Maricopa. Accessed March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compulsory arbitration in Australia==
The [[Australia]]n [[Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904]] introduced the rule of law in industrial relations for Australia by establishing the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]].

Since 1906 Australia has enforced a system of compulsory arbitration between employers and employees.  This statutory system of arbitration, the Industrial Relations Court or Commission, and the [[Harvester Judgment|Harvester]] court case underpin the Australian industrial relations system.

This system has been amended since 1983. The former [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] government, led by [[John Howard]], sought to further modify it through [[WorkChoices]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/432094/organized-labour/66938/Compulsory-arbitration-and-union-growth-in-Australasia Organized Labor in Australia]. Britannica Online. Accessed March 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The former Labor government, during the Rudd-Gillard era, sought to re-establish regulation surrounding compulsory arbitration of Australia's industrial relations regime through other means.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

{{refimprove|date=April 2014}}

A '''corporate promoter''' is a firm or person who does the preliminary work incidental to the formation of a company, including its [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]], and [[Initial public offering|flotation]], and solicits people to invest money in the company, usually when it is being formed. An [[investment banker]], an [[underwriter]], or a [[stock promoter]] may, wholly or in part, perform the role of a promoter. Promoters generally owe a duty of utmost good faith, so as to not mislead any potential investors, and disclose all material facts about the company's business.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co]]'' (1878) 3 App Cas 1218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiduciary duties==
Generally, promoters are in a [[fiduciary relationship]] with the company and its [[investor]]s and  [[shareholder]]s, and must avoid [[conflicts of interest]]s and exercise reasonable care in performing their duties. They must refrain from self-dealing or other types of abuse to take advantage of their position as a promoter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Self-dealing occurs, for example, when a promoter unfairly profits from the conduct of business with the company by charging higher prices for the goods they sell to the company than it would otherwise pay.

A promoter can be a shareholder in the promoted company. If the promoter is the only shareholder, the company may, in compliance with the rule of the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and similar rules in other jurisdictions, need to disclose the information prior to selling shares to the public.

The fiduciary duties of promoters include:

* not to make any secret profit out of the promotion of the company. Secret profit is made by entering into a transaction on their own behalf and then selling the concerned property to the company at a profit, without disclosing the profit to the company or its members. Pomoters can make profits in dealings with the company, provided they discloses these profits to the company and its members.
* to make full disclosure to the company of all relevant facts, including any profit made by them in transactions with the company.

If a promoter fails to disclose the profits, made by him in the course of promotion or he knowingly makes a false statement in the prospectus, whereby the person relying on that statement, makes a loss, he will be liable to make good the loss, suffered by that other person. The promoter is liable for untrue statements, made in the prospectus.

A person, who subscribes for any shares or debenture in a company on the faith of the untrue statement contained in the prospectus, can sue the promoter for the loss or damages, sustained by the subscriber as the result of such untrue statement.

==Types of promoters==
Promoters may be classified into the following types.

===Professional promoters===
There are firms which specialise in company promotion, including its incorporation and flotation, before handing it over to the shareholders or their representatives for the company.

===Occasional promoters===
These promoters take interest in floating some companies. They are not engaged in promotion work on a regular basis. They take up the promotion of some company and once it is over they go to their original profession.For instance, engineers, lawyers etc. may float some companies.

===Entrepreneur promoters===
They are both promoters and entrepreneurs. They conceive the idea of a new business unit, do the groundwork to establish it and may subsequently become a part of the management.

===Financial promoters===
Some financial institutions, like investment banks or industrial banks, may take up the promotion of a company with a view to finding opportunities for investment.

==Functions of promoters==
The functions of a promoter may include:

===Discovery of a business idea===
The first stage in company promotion is the generation of new ideas. It is the promoter who conceives the idea of setting up a business, and makes an assessment of the viability of a particular aspects business be it technical feasibility ,financial feasibility ,economic feasibility and also incorporation of company .

===Detailed investigation===
Promoters undertakes a detailed investigation of the viability, profitability and future prospects of the growth of the proposed activity, and may seek the help of specialists such as lawyers, accountants, cost accountants, a company secretary, and engineers. Organisations engaged in market research and other specialised agencies. Specialists are in a position to make an objective analysis of their own areas which may help the promoters. Decisions have to be taken regarding the size, location, layout, manpower etc.

===Assembling the factors of production===
If the proposed endeavour gives promise of success and the promoter is willing to undertake the risk of forming the business, step must be taken to assemble various factors of production, such as land, labour, capital and managerial personnel. Assembly of resources involves making contracts for the purchase of these resources.promoters organise the resources to convert the idea into a reality by forming a company.

===Entering into preliminary contracts===
The promoter may enter into contracts with third parties in anticipation of the registration of a company; but after registration, the company must approve or confirm these contracts.

'''David Eccles''' (May 12, 1849 – December 6, 1912) was an American [[businessman]] and [[industrialist]] who founded many businesses throughout the western [[United States]] and became [[Utah]]'s first multimillionaire.

==Biography==
Eccles was born  in [[Paisley, Scotland|Paisley]], [[Scotland]] to William and Sarah Hutchinson Eccles.  In 1863 his family moved from [[Glasgow, Scotland|Glasgow]] to the [[United States of America]], sailing on the ''Cynosure''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/the-cynosure-group/private-equity-investors/prweb11916306.htm "Eccles Family Backs New Investment Firm, The Cynosure Group"], [[Vocus (software)|PRWEB]], June 5, 2014. Retrieved 2017-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually settling in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden Valley]] located in eastern [[Weber County, Utah]].  The move was made because of their joining [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and their desire to be near the body of the church.  He lived in both [[Eden, Utah|Eden]] and [[Liberty, Utah|Liberty]], [[Utah]].

After struggling to make a living, the family moved to [[Oregon City, Oregon]].  There they worked in a new mill.  He worked for the mill for a year, then for a lumber corporation, and the [[Oregon and California Railroad]].  The family moved back to [[Ogden, Utah]] in 1869 after the completion of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] hoping it would bring them work.

In the Ogden area, he worked cutting wood and building homes.  He worked as a freighter and for the [[Union Pacific]] coal mines.  He also worked at a sawmill at Monte Cristo east of Ogden.

In 1874, he attended [[Louis F. Moench]]'s school in Ogden.  It was there he met Bertha Marie Jensen and married her in 1875.  They had 12 children from this marriage.

While he had been working he saved up a considerable amount of money and put it to other uses.  He started the Eccles Lumber Company and several other enterprises. Through supplying ties for railroads, he knew the local circumstances of where the railroads were building and the opportunities available.  He opened lumber mills, shingle mills, planing mills, an electric plant, and other entities.  He followed the railroads and opened mills in other locations in Oregon and Washington states.  He and his associates built the [[Sumpter Valley Railway|Sumpter Valley]] and [[Mount Hood Railroad|Mount Hood]] railroads.  It was through these and other railroads that Eccles shipped the lumber and other goods to Utah.

Eccles met Ellen Stoddard, the daughter of his partner, John Stoddard.  Under the practice of [[polygamy]] at the time, David married Ellen, and they made their home in [[Logan, Utah]] where he built a lavish yellow brick mansion for his new bride using lumber imported from his corporation in Oregon.  (The home is on West Center Street.)  [[Marriner Stoddard Eccles]] is a son of this marriage.

Eccles was a hard worker.  He reported himself to have traveled over {{convert|44000|mi|km}} in 1904.  While friends encouraged him to slow down, he preferred to "die in the harness."  One of his hallmarks was integrity and self-reliance.  His companies prospered on his no debt plan, and view of achieving success rather than money.

David always put his children to work early in life.  They worked along with the crews on the railroads, mills, and lumber yards.  They were taught as many aspects of the businesses as they were willing to learn.  Several went and served missions for the LDS Church.  One son graduated from [[University of Michigan Law School]], another from [[Columbia University]], others from [[Brigham Young College]], [[Utah State University]], and the [[University of Utah]].

With the estimated 4-7 million dollars he made, mostly from his Oregon enterprises, he invested heavily in Utah.  He purchased stock in banks, canneries, insurance companies, railroads, factories, mills, mines, and various other companies.  The [[Utah Construction Company]] built over {{convert|700|mi|km}} of track for the [[Western Pacific Railroad]] and led the [[Six Companies]] in constructing the [[Hoover Dam]]. David Eccles served as the second president of [[Utah Construction Company]] after the death of long-term associate [[Thomas Duncombe Dee|Thomas Dee]].  He also served as founder of a number of companies, one of which was the [[Amalgamated Sugar Company]].

Eccles served on the Ogden City Council and as their mayor from 1888-1890.  He was known for his aid to the LDS Church for lending large amounts of money to the church at no interest.  At the time of his death, he was the president of 16 industrial corporations and 7 banks.  He also was serving as a director in 24 other banks and industries.  He is Utah's first multimillionaire.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

While running to catch the evening train from Salt Lake City to Ogden, Utah, he died of a heart attack in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] on December 6, 1912 at the age of 63. 

There are a host of organizations named after Eccles and his descendants.  The [[David Eccles School of Business]] is at the [[University of Utah]].  The [[David Eccles Conference Center]] is in downtown Ogden, Utah.
His relative's in the U.K include Leeds rugby player Graham Eccles

==Descendants==

'''Debt validation''', or "debt verification", refers to a [[consumer]]'s right to challenge a debt and/or receive written verification of a debt from a debt collector.  The right to dispute the debt and receive validation are part of the consumer's rights under the [[United States]] Federal [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]] (FDCPA) and are set out in §809 of that act, which has been codified in Title 15, Section 1692-1692p of the [[United States Code]].&lt;ref name = "Section g"&gt;{{usc|15|1692g}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debt validation procedure was expected
to reduce the incidence of debt collectors [[Dunning (process)|dunning]] the wrong person or attempting to collect previously paid debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act--The Consumer's Answer to Abusive Collection Practices|author=J Tavormina|publisher=Tul. L. Rev.|year=1978|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=52+Tul.+L.+Rev.+584&amp;key=8cf8dcbf9ed2279bf01535b1104db1f0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persons or entities considered debt collectors==
Under the [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]], any person or entity, including lawyers, who regularly attempts to collect consumer debts is considered a debt collector&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|15|1692a|6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is therefore required to respond to proper debt validation requests. In contrast, the original creditor and its employees are generally not subject to the FDCPA, though they may be regulated by other state and federal laws; including the  [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], which was modified by the [[Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act]] in 2003. The original Act excluded lawyers from the definition of "debt collector" by explicitly exempting from any coverage “any attorney-at-law collecting a debt as an attorney on behalf of and in the name of a client.” The definition of "debt collector" was amended in 1986 to omit the prior exemption for attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=85|publisher=Ky. L.J.|pages=463|date=1996–1997|title=Attorney Liability under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act|author=Knight, Chad M.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/kentlj85&amp;section=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the amendment, some attorneys maintained that litigation in an attempt to collect a debt did not bring them within the definition of "debt collector" in {{uscsub|15|1692a|6}}. This issue was not resolved until 1995, when the Supreme Court determined that the FDCPA applies to any attorneys who regularly engage in debt collection activity, even if it includes litigation.&lt;ref&gt;''Heinz v. Jenkins'', 514 U.S. 291, 115 S.Ct. 1489, 131 L.Ed. 2d. 395 (1995)[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-367.ZO.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time limits for disputing a debt or requesting validation==
A consumer can dispute all or any part of a debt at any time, but only a written request sent within thirty days of receipt of the first written notice of the debt triggers validation rights under the FDCPA.  {{uscsub|15|1692g|a}} requires specific information regarding the consumer's right to dispute all or part of the debt to be provided in writing to the consumer within 5 days of the initial communication. {{uscsub|15|1692g|b}} specifies the response required of a debt collector upon receipt of a timely written or oral dispute, most notably that it shall cease collection of the debt until the collector mails the consumer "verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor."

Thus, there is no time limit for providing the required verification or other information, just that the collector must cease collection until it provides the required information. {{uscsub|15|1692g|b}} also contains a prohibition against the collection activities and communications during the initial 30 days of contact with the consumer overshadowing or being inconsistent with the consumer's right to dispute the debt or request the name and address of the original. {{uscsub|15|1692g|c}} provides that failure by the consumer to dispute the debt during the thirty-day period after the debt collector's initial communication with the consumer may not be construed by any court as an admission by the consumer that he is liable for the debt.

==Difficulty in defining what constitutes debt validation==
The FDCPA does not define what constitutes proper debt validation, and the issue has not been fully resolved by the courts.  In the leading case of ''Chaudhry v. Gallerizzo'', the [[Fourth Circuit]] Court of Appeals adopted a relatively low standard: "Verification of a debt involves nothing more than the debt collector confirming in writing that the amount being demanded is what the creditor is claiming is owed; the debt collector is not required to keep detailed files of the alleged debt."&lt;ref name = "Chaudhry" &gt;{{cite court|litigants=Chaudhry v. Gallerizzo |vol=174 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=394 |court=4th Cir. |date=1999 |url=http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/981024.P.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court further stated that a request for validation of the debt is primarily intended to eliminate such problems as collectors contacting the wrong person or attempting to collect debts which have already been paid.&lt;ref name = "Chaudhry" /&gt;  In 2006, the [[Ninth Circuit]] Court of Appeals followed and adopted what they described as the "reasonable standard" articulated in Chaudhry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Clark v. Capital Credit &amp; Collection Servs. |vol=460 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1162 |court=9th Cir. |date=2006 |url=http://classactiondefense.jmbm.com/clarkclassactiondefense_opn.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consumer advocate]]s have criticized the Chaudhry and Clark cases as setting too low a legal standard for validation and allowing debt collectors to justify providing little information in response to a dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerlaw.org/publications/reports/content/nclc_rept_repo.pdf |title=Ninth and Fourth Circuit Decisions May Diminish Consumer Debt Dispute Rights |work=NCLC Reports |publisher=[[National Consumer Law Center]] |date=November–December 2006 |accessdate=2007-02-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203101312/http://www.consumerlaw.org/publications/reports/content/nclc_rept_repo.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, some courts (such as the [[Court of Appeals]] of [[Indiana]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Spears v. Brennan |vol=745 |reporter=N.E.2d |opinion=862 |court=Ind.App. |date=2001 |url=http://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/archive/03260101.ewn.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have taken a stricter stance on debt validation than the Chuadhry Court, though the [[precedent]]ial value of such cases is uncertain.

==Consequences of debt collector not responding==

There is no deadline for the debt collector to provide a response to the request for validation. However, a debt collector must cease all attempts to collect the debt until they have sent a sufficient response.&lt;ref name= "Section g" /&gt;

If a consumer makes a timely request for debt validation and a debt collector fails to provide proper validation or does not respond at all, the debt collector may not legally continue to pursue the debt.  If collection activity continues, the consumer may file a lawsuit in state or federal court for violation of the FDCPA (see [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]] for discussion of FDCPA lawsuits).&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1692k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any dispute of the debt must also be reported by the creditor on the consumer's [[credit report]] pursuant to the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (FCRA).

In [[variance analysis (accounting)]] '''direct material total variance''' is the difference between the [[actual cost]] of [[actual number]] of units produced  and its budgeted cost in terms of material.  Direct material total variance can be divided into two components:
*the [[direct material price variance]],
*the [[direct material usage variance]].

==Example==
Let us assume that standard direct material cost of [[Widget (economics)|widget]] is as follows:
:2 kg of [[unobtainium]] at $ 60 per kg ( = $ 120 per unit). 
Let us assume further that during the given period, 100 widgets were manufactured, using 212&amp;nbsp;kg of [[unobtainium]] which cost $ 13,144.

Under those assumptions direct material total variance can be calculated as:
{{Infobox VarianceAnalysis VarianceBox|tx1=100 units should have cost (&amp;times; $ 120 per unit)
|tx2=but did cost
|tx3=Direct material total variance
|am1=12,000
|am2=13,144
|am3=1,144
|va1=A
}}
Direct material total variance can be reconciled to [[direct material price variance]] and [[direct material usage variance]] by:
{{Infobox VarianceAnalysis VarianceBoxRec|tx1=Direct material usage variance
|tx2=Direct material price variance
|tx3=Direct material total variance
|am1=720
|am2=424
|am3=1,144
|va1=A
|va2=A
|va3=A
}}
See [[direct material usage variance#Example]] and [[direct material price variance#Example]] for computations of both components.

'''Energy consulting''' is a sub-discipline of [[environmental consulting]] that focuses on optimizing a [[business]]' [[energy usage]], as well as the sources from which the actual [[energy]] is derived. Energy consulting is often centered on reducing [[operating cost|operational cost]]s, though this is not always the main goal. With the increasing importance of [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) in the minds of the general public, enterprise level businesses may contract an '''energy consultant''' to include more [[environmentally friendly]] energy sources into their energy mix.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powercall.nl/werken-bij/ |title=Power Call |accessdate=November 5, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lnCfmbKv?url=http://www.powercall.nl/werken-bij/ |archivedate=November 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ. do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps].

With the recent volatility in the [[energy industry]],&lt;ref&gt;http://solution105.com/BlogArticles/blog/default.aspx?id=34&amp;t=Energy-Market-Update-November-2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/power-struggle-making-the-most-of-generation-assets-in-turbulent-times.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; energy consulting is quickly becoming a main component of business operations for enterprises worldwide.

== Role of hedging and financial analysis ==
As a result of the volatility in the modern energy industry, many enterprise level businesses are turning to [[financial analyst]]s, specifically through the use of [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] to minimize exposure to the unstable energy industry.

(b) If the Magistrate observes in any police officer above the rank of Inspector incompetence or unfitness he may communicate with the Inspector-General, who after paying careful attention to the views of the District Magistrate, shall determine what measures should be taken and shall inform the Magistrate of the action which he takes in the matter.

The '''Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization''' is a document signed in 2004 by a number of non-profit organizations, scientists, academics and other individuals urging the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) to focus on the needs of developing countries with respect to [[intellectual property]] legislation.

The authors and signatories believe that the "world is facing a crisis in the governance of [[knowledge]], [[technology]], and [[culture]]", in particular due to unequal access to vital [[medicine]]s and [[education]], anticompetitive [[economics|economic]] practices, concentration of [[ownership]], technological measures such as [[digital rights management]] (DRM), the fair compensation of authors and creators, and the locking up of the [[public domain]] by [[private property|private]] interests.

The Declaration criticises WIPO for embracing "a culture of creating and expanding monopoly privileges, often without regard to consequences", and calls for the organization to shift its focus from intellectual property as an end in and of itself, to a means for benefiting [[All humanity|humanity]]. In particular, it calls for a moratorium on the now-common practice of harmonizing intellectual property legislation throughout the [[developing world]] to the laws as they exist in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].

In 2009 this resulted into the [[World_Intellectual_Property_Organization#Development_agenda|WIPO Development Agenda]], which incorporated some of the proposals.

The '''history of competition law''' refers to attempts by governments to regulate competitive markets for goods and services, leading up to the modern [[Competition law|competition]] or [[antitrust]] laws around the world today. The earliest records traces back to the efforts of Roman legislators to control price fluctuations and unfair trade practices. Throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, kings and queens repeatedly cracked down on monopolies, including those created through state legislation. The English [[common law]] doctrine of [[restraint of trade]] became the precursor to modern competition law. This grew out of the codifications of United States [[antitrust]] statutes, which in turn had considerable influence on the development of [[European Community competition law]]s after the [[Second World War]]. Increasingly the focus has moved to international competition enforcement in a globalised economy.

==Early history==
{{Competition law}}
Laws governing competition law are found in over two millennia of history. Roman Emperors and Mediaeval monarchs alike used [[tariff]]s to stabilise prices or support local production. The formal study of "competition", began in earnest during the 18th century with such works as [[Adam Smith]]'s [[The Wealth of Nations]]. Different terms were used to describe this area of the law, including "[[restrictive practices]]", "the law of monopolies", "[[combination acts]]" and the "[[restraint of trade]]".

===Roman legislation===
{{seealso|Roman law}}
The earliest surviving example of modern competition law's ancestors appears in the ''Lex Julia de Annona'', enacted during the [[Roman Republic]] around 50 BC.&lt;ref&gt;This is Julius Caesar's time according to Babled in ''De La Cure Annone chez le Romains''&lt;/ref&gt; To protect the corn trade, heavy fines were imposed on anyone directly, deliberately and insidiously stopping supply ships.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p.20"&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Diocletian]], in 301 AD an [[Edict on maximum prices]] established a death penalty for anyone violating a tariff system, for example by buying up, concealing or contriving the scarcity of everyday goods.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p.20"/&gt; The most legislation came under the Constitution of Zeno of 483 AD which can be traced into Florentine Municipal laws of 1322 and 1325.&lt;ref&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p.22&lt;/ref&gt; It provided for property confiscation and banishment for any trade combinations or joint action of monopolies private ''or'' granted by the Emperor. [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] rescinded all previously granted exclusive rights.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p.21"&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p.21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justinian I]] also introduced legislation not long after to pay officials to manage state monopolies. As Europe slipped into the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], so did the records of law making until the Middle Ages brought greater expansion of trade in the time of ''[[lex mercatoria]]''.

===Middle ages===
{{seealso|Lex Mercatoria|Guilds}}
[[Image:Edward3.jpg|left|thumb|Edward III during the [[Black Death]] enacted the [[Statute of Labourers]] to cap wages, and provide double damages against infringers]]
Legislation in England to control monopolies and restrictive practices were in force well before the [[Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p.21"/&gt; The [[Domesday Book]] recorded that "[[Engrossing (law)|foresteel]]" (i.e. forestalling, the practice of buying up goods before they reached market and then inflating the prices) was one of three [[Forfeiture (law)|forfeitures]] that [[King Edward the Confessor]] could carry out through England.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Pollock]] and [[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]], ''History of English Law'' Vol. II, 453&lt;/ref&gt; Concern for fair prices also led to attempts to directly regulate the market. Under Henry III, an Act was passed in 1266&lt;ref&gt;51 &amp; 52 Hen. 3, Stat. 1&lt;/ref&gt; to fix bread and ale prices in correspondence with corn prices laid down by the [[assize]]s. Penalties for breach included [[amercement]]s, [[pillory]] and [[tumbrel]].&lt;ref&gt;51 &amp; 52 Hen. 3, Stat. 6&lt;/ref&gt; A fourteenth century statute labelled forestallers as "oppressors of the poor and the community at large and enemies of the whole country."&lt;ref&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[King Edward III]], the [[Statute of Labourers]] of 1349&lt;ref&gt;23 Edw. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; fixed wages of artificers and workmen and decreed that foodstuffs should be sold at reasonable prices. On top of existing penalties, the statute stated that overcharging merchants must pay the injured party double the sum they received, an idea that has been replicated in [[Punitive damages|punitive]] [[treble damages]] under [[US antitrust law]]. Also under Edward III, the following statutory provision in the poetic language of the time outlawed trade combinations.&lt;ref&gt;27 Edw. 3, Stat. 2, c. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...we have ordained and established, that no merchant or other shall make Confederacy, Conspiracy, Coin, Imagination, or Murmur, or Evil Device in any point that may turn to the Impeachment, Disturbance, Defeating or Decay of the said Staples, or of anything that to them pertaineth, or may pertain."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples of legislation in Europe include the ''constitutiones juris metallici'' by [[Wenceslas II]] of [[Bohemia]] between 1283 and 1305, condemning combinations of ore traders increasing prices; the Municipal Statutes of Florence in 1322 and 1325 followed [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]'s legislation against state monopolies; and under [[Emperor Charles V]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] a law was passed "to prevent losses resulting from monopolies and improper contracts which many merchants and artisans made in the Netherlands." In 1553 [[King Henry VIII]] reintroduced tariffs for foodstuffs, designed to stabilise prices in the face of fluctuations in supply from overseas. The legislation read here that whereas,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"it is very hard and difficult to put certain prices to any such things... [it is necessary because] prices of such victuals be many times enhanced and raised by the Greedy Covetousness and Appetites of the Owners of such Victuals, by occasion of ingrossing and regrating the same, more than upon any reasonable or just ground or cause, to the great damage and impoverishing of the King's subjects."&lt;ref&gt;25 Hen. 8, c. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around this time, organisations representing various tradesmen and handicraftspeople, known as [[guild]]s had been established and enjoyed many concessions and exemptions from the laws against monopolies. The privileges conferred were not abolished until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.

===Renaissance developments===
{{seealso|Renaissance}}
[[Image:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth I assured monopolies would not be abused in the early era of [[globalisation]]]]
Europe around the 15th century was changing quickly. The new world had just been opened up, overseas trade and plunder was pouring wealth through the international economy and attitudes among businessmen were shifting. In 1561, a system of Industrial Monopoly Licences, similar to modern [[patents]] had been introduced into England. But by the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the system was reputedly much abused and used merely to preserve privileges, encouraging nothing new in the way of innovation or manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;according to [[William Searle Holdsworth]], 4 Holdsworth, 3rd ed., Chap. 4 p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; When a protest was made in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and a Bill was introduced, the Queen convinced the protesters to challenge the case in the courts. This was the catalyst for the [[Case of Monopolies]] or ''[[Darcy v Allin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(1602) 11 Co. Rep. 84b&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff, an officer of the Queen's household, had been granted the sole right of making playing cards and claimed damages for the defendant's infringement of this right. The court found the grant void and that three characteristics of monopoly were (1) price increases (2) quality decrease (3) the tendency to reduce artificers to idleness and beggary. This put a temporary end to complaints about monopoly, until [[James I of England|King James I]] began to grant them again. In 1623 Parliament passed the [[Statute of Monopolies]], which for the most part excluded patent rights from its prohibitions, as well as the guilds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} From [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], through the civil war and to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], monopolies continued, and were considered especially useful for raising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. one John Manley paid £10,000 p.a. from 1654 to the Crown for a tender on the "postage of letters both inland and foreign" Wilberforce (1966) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1684, in ''[[East India Company v Sandys]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1685) 10 St. Tr. 371&lt;/ref&gt; it was decided that exclusive rights to trade only outside the realm were legitimate on the grounds that only large and powerful concerns could trade in the conditions prevailing overseas. In 1710, to deal with high coal prices caused by a Newcastle Coal Monopoly, the New Law was passed.&lt;ref&gt;9 Anne, c. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Its provisions stated that "all and every contract or contracts, Covenants and Agreements, whether the same be in writing or not in writing...[between] persons whatsoever concerned the said Coal trade, for Ingrossing Coals, or for restraining or hindering any Person or Persons whomsoever from freely... disposing of Coals....  are hereby declared to be illegal." When Adam Smith wrote the ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, An Enquiry into the Wealth of Nations'' (1776)&lt;/ref&gt; he was somewhat cynical of the possibility for change.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To expect indeed that freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored in Great Britain is as absurd as to expect that [[The Commonwealth of Oceana|Oceana]] or [[Utopia]] should ever be established in it. Not only the prejudices of the public, but what is more unconquerable, the private interests of many individuals irresistibly oppose it. The Member of Parliament who supports any proposal for strengthening this Monopoly is seen to acquire not only the reputation for understanding trade, but great popularity and influence with an order of men whose members and wealth render them of great importance."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Restraint of trade===
{{main|Restraint of trade}}
[[Image:Edward coke.jpg|thumb|200pxl|Judge [[Edward Coke|Coke]] in the 17th century thought that general restraints on trade were unreasonable.]]
The English law of restraint of trade is the direct predecessor to modern competition law.&lt;ref&gt;"the modern common law of England [has] passed directly into the legislation and thereafter into the judge-made law of the United States." Wilberforce (1966) p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Its current use is small, given modern and economically oriented statutes in most common law countries. Its approach was based on the two concepts of prohibiting agreements that ran counter to public policy, unless the [[Reasonable person|reasonableness]] of an agreement could be shown. A restraint of trade is simply some kind of agreed provision that is designed to restrain another's trade. For example, in ''[[Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Gun Co]]''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Gun Co]]'' [1894] AC 535&lt;/ref&gt; a Swedish arms inventor promised on sale of his business to an American gun maker that he "would not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world, and would not compete with Maxim in any way."

To consider whether or not there is a restraint of trade in the first place, both parties must have provided valuable [[consideration]] for their agreement. In ''[[Dyer's case]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1414) 2 Hen. 5, 5 Pl. 26&lt;/ref&gt; a dyer had given a bond not to exercise his trade in the same town as the plaintiff for six months but the plaintiff had promised nothing in return. On hearing the plaintiff's attempt to enforce this restraint, Hull J exclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"per Dieu, if the plaintiff were here, he should go to prison until he had paid a fine to the King."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The common law has evolved to reflect changing business conditions. So in the 1613 case of ''[[Rogers v Parry]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rogers v Parry]]'' (1613) 2 Bulstr. 136; (1613) 79 ER 278&lt;/ref&gt; a court held that a joiner who promised not to trade from his house for 21 years could have this bond enforced against him since the time and place was certain. It was also held that a man cannot bind himself to not use his trade generally by [[Edward Coke|Chief Justice Coke]]. This was followed in ''[[Broad v Jolyffe]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Broad v Jolyffe]]'' (1620) Cro. Jac. 596&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mitchel v Reynolds]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mitchel v Reynolds]]'' (1711) 1 P.Wms. 181&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield|Lord Macclesfield]] asked, "What does it signify to a tradesman in London what another does in Newcastle?" In times of such slow communications, commerce around the country it seemed axiomatic that a general restraint served no legitimate purpose for one's business and ought to be void. But already in 1880 in ''[[Roussillon v Roussillon]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Roussillon v Roussillon]]'' (1880) 14 ChD 351&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Fry|Lord Justice Fry]] stated that a restraint unlimited in space need not be void, since the real question was whether it went further than necessary for the promisee's protection. So in the ''Nordenfelt'' case&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; case Lord McNaughton rule that while one could validly promise to "not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world" it was and unreasonable restraint to "not compete with Maxim in any way." This approach in England was confirmed by the House of Lords in ''[[Mason v The Provident Supply and Clothing Co]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mason v The Provident Supply and Clothing Co.]]'' [1913] AC 724&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern age==
Modern competition law begins with the United States legislation of the [[Sherman Act]] of 1890 and the [[Clayton Act]] of 1914. While other, particularly European, countries also had some form of regulation on monopolies and cartels, the U.S. codification of the common law position on restraint of trade had a widespread effect on subsequent competition law development. Both after [[World War II]] and after the fall of the [[Berlin wall]], competition law has gone through phases of renewed attention and legislative updates around the world.

===United States antitrust===
{{main|United States antitrust law}}
[[Image:Standard Oil.jpg|thumb|right|[[Standard Oil]] was one of the greatest companies to be broken up under United States antitrust laws]]
The American term [[Trust (19th century)|anti-trust]] arose not because the U.S. statutes had anything to do with ordinary [[trust law]], but because the large American corporations used trusts to conceal the nature of their business arrangements. Big trusts became synonymous with big monopolies, the perceived threat to democracy and the free market these trusts represented led passage of the [[Sherman Act|Sherman]] and [[Clayton Act]]s. These laws, in part, codified past American and English [[common law]] of restraints of trade. [[George Frisbie Hoar|Senator Hoar]], an author of the [[Sherman Act]] said in a debate, "We have affirmed the old doctrine of the common law in regard to all inter-state and international commercial transactions and have clothed the United States courts with authority to enforce that doctrine by injunction." Evidence of the common law basis of the Sherman and Clayton Acts is found in ''[[Standard Oil of New Jersey v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;221 U.S. 1 (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Edward Douglass White|Chief Justice White]] explicitly linked the Sherman Act with the common law and sixteenth-century English statutes on engrossing.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Under [[King Edward VI]] in 1552, 5 &amp; 6 Edw. 6, c. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The Act's wording also reflects common law. The first two sections read as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Sherman Act did not have the immediate effects its authors intended, although [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s federal government sued 45 companies, and [[William Taft]] used it against 75 companies. The [[Clayton Act]] of 1914 was passed to supplement the Sherman Act. Specific categories of abusive conduct were listed, including [[price discrimination]](section 2), exclusive dealings (section 3) and mergers which substantially lessened competition (section 7). Section 6 exempted trade unions from the law's operation. Both the Sherman and Clayton Acts are now codified under [[Title 15 of the United States Code|Title 15]] of the [[United States Code]].

===Post war consensus===

{{seealso|Competition regulator}}

It was after the [[First World War]] that countries began to follow the United States' lead in competition policy. In 1923, Canada introduced the [[Combines Investigation Act]] and in 1926 France reinforced its basic competition provisions from the 1810 Code Napoleon. After [[World War II]], the Allies, led by the United States, introduced tight regulation of cartels and monopolies in occupied Germany and Japan. In Germany, despite the existence of laws against [[unfair business practices]] and [[unfair competition]] passed in 1909 (''Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb'' or ''UWG'') it was widely believed that the predominance of large cartels of German industry had made it easier for the [[Nazis]] to assume total economic control simply by bribing or blackmailing the heads of a small number of industrial magnates. Similarly in Japan, where business was organised along family and nepotistic ties, the [[zaibatsu]] were easy for the government to manipulate into the war effort. Following World War II and the unconditional surrender of Japan and Germany, tighter controls, replicating the existing American policies and regulations were introduced.

However, further developments were considerably overshadowed by the move towards [[nationalisation]] and industry-wide planning in many countries. Making the economy and industry democratically accountable through direct government action became a priority. Coal industry, railroads, steel, electricity, [[Water law|water]], health care and many other sectors were targeted for their special qualities of being [[Natural monopoly|natural monopolies]]. [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries were slow in enacting statutory competition law provisions. The United Kingdom introduced the (considerably less stringent) Restrictive Practices Act in 1956. Australia introduced its current [[Trade Practices Act 1974|Trade Practices Act]] in 1974. Recently however there has been a wave of updates, especially in Europe to harmonise legislation with contemporary competition law thinking.

===European Union law===
{{morefootnotes|section|date=July 2008}}
{{main|European Community competition law}}
In 1957 six Western European countries signed the [[Treaty of the European Community]] (EC Treaty or Treaty of Rome), which over the last fifty years has grown into a [[European Union]] of nearly half a billion citizens. The European Community is the name for the economic and social pillar of [[EU law]], under which competition law falls. Healthy competition is seen as an essential element in the creation of a common market free from restraints on trade. The first provision is Article 81 EC, which deals with cartels and restrictive vertical agreements. Prohibited are...

&lt;blockquote&gt;"(1) ...all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 81(1) EC then gives examples of "hard core" restrictive practices such as price fixing or market sharing and 81(2) EC confirms that any agreements are automatically void. However, just like the [[Statute of Monopolies 1623]], Article 81(3) EC creates exemptions, if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation, gives consumers a "fair share" of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints (or disproportionate, in ECJ terminology) that risk eliminating competition anywhere. Article 82 EC deals with monopolies, or more precisely firms who have a dominant market share and abuse that position. Unlike [[U.S. Antitrust]], EC law has never been used to punish the existence of dominant firms, but merely imposes a special responsibility to conduct oneself appropriately. Specific categories of abuse listed in Article 82 EC include price discrimination and exclusive dealing, much the same as sections 2 and 3 of the U.S. Clayton Act. Also under Article 82 EC, the Council of the European Union was empowered to enact a [[European Union regulation|regulation]] to control mergers between firms, currently the latest known by the abbreviation of ECMR "Reg. 139/2004". The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede [[effective competition]]. Again, the similarity to the [[Clayton Act]]'s substantial lessening of competition. Finally, Articles 86 and 87 EC regulate the state's role in the market. Article 86(2) EC states clearly that nothing in the rules can be used to obstruct a member state's right to deliver public services, but that otherwise public enterprises must play by the same rules on collusion and abuse of dominance as everyone else. Article 87 EC, similar to Article 81 EC, lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition, but then grants exceptions for things like charities, natural disasters or regional development.

===International enforcement===
{{seealso|World Trade Organization|International Competition Network}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Wto logo.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[World Trade Organization]] members have been recently discussing how future global competition law could look]] --&gt;
Competition law has already been substantially internationalised along the lines of the US model by nation states themselves, however the involvement of international organisations has been growing. Increasingly active at all international conferences are the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), which is prone to making neo-liberal recommendations about the total application of competition law for public and private industries.&lt;ref&gt;see, [[Tony Prosser]], ''The Limits of Competition Law'' (2005) ch.1&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 5 of the post war [[Havana Charter]] contained an Antitrust code&lt;ref&gt;see a speech by Wood, ''The Internationalisation of Antitrust Law: Options for the Future'' 3 February 1995, at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/speeches/future.txt&lt;/ref&gt; but this was never incorporated into the WTO's forerunner, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] 1947. [[Office of Fair Trading]] Director and Professor Richard Whish wrote sceptically that it "seems unlikely at the current stage of its development that the WTO will metamorphose into a global competition authority."&lt;ref&gt;Whish (2003) p.448&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, at the ongoing [[Doha round]] of trade talks for the [[World Trade Organization]], discussion includes the prospect of competition law enforcement moving up to a global level. While it is incapable of enforcement itself, the newly established [[International Competition Network]]&lt;ref&gt;see, http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (ICN) is a way for national authorities to coordinate their own enforcement activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10635">'''Jan Kobylański''' (born 21 July 1923 in [[Rivne|Rowne]], [[Poland]]) is a Polish-Paraguayan businessman. He is the founder of the Union of Polish Associations and Organizations in Latin America ([[Polish language|pol.]] ''Unia Stowarzyszeń i Organizacji Polskich w Ameryce Łacińskiej, USOPAŁ'') the largest Polish immigrant organization of [[South America]]. He was a founder of one of the world's largest companies involved in editing postage stamps, and coins mintage. He has written books on [[philately]], as well as on the mediation policy of the [[Roman Curia]]. He was formerly the honorary consul of Poland to [[Paraguay]], and the honorary consul of Paraguay to [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], Spain.

==Biography==
Kobylański was the son of Polish [[Lawyer|attorney at law]] Stanisław Kobylański. In 1943 he was arrested by the [[Nazi]]s, and imprisoned at Warsaw's infamous [[Pawiak]] prison. He was a prisoner in the German [[concentration camp]]s [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] and [[Gross Rosen]]. After [[World War II]], he moved to Italy, where he produced [[toothbrush]]es, and sold kitchen appliances. He became co-owner of the ''Astral Metal Technica'' company in [[Milan]].

In 1952, he arrived in Paraguay, taking advantage of President [[Federico Chaves]]' immigration program, which allowed 18,000 families from [[Europe]] to settle in that country. Soon he won a contract to import kitchen appliances, and another to print postage stamps for the National Postal Service. In the next few years, he developed one of the world's largest{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} stamp printing and coin minting companies.

According to Polish journalists Jerzy Morawski and Mikołaj Lizut, Kobylański had a good relationship with Paraguayan president, General [[Alfredo Stroessner]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Morawski "Mroczne strony milionera" [[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]] 66/2005 and Mikołaj Lizut "Podwójne życie don Juana" [[Gazeta Wyborcza|GW]] 149/2004, [[Gazeta Wyborcza|Duży Format]].&lt;/ref&gt; Kobylański, however, denies this.&lt;ref&gt;''I was an honorary consul of the Paraguay for seventeen years, but I never met president Stroessner, for what I have very strong evidence. So, how I could be a friend of him?'' [http://www.usopal.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1112&amp;Itemid=1 "Piotr Korycki's interview with mr. Jan Kobylański, president of the USOPAŁ"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''As you propabably know from the documents, and articles in the Paraguayan press (I am in possession of original copies), president Kobylański never personally met president Alfredo Stroessner (...) It's obvious, that invectives and lies of Mr. Lizut pretend to link Mr. Kobylański with Nazis and Alfredo Stroessner as well'' [http://www.usopal.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=50 Leopold Biłozur, "List otwarty do Adama Michnika"]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1989 to 2000, Kobylański was an honorary Polish consul in [[Argentina]]. He was removed from office by Polish minister of foreign affairs [[Władysław Bartoszewski]], after former Polish ambassadors to [[Uruguay]] and [[Costa Rica]] accused Kobylański of [[antisemitism]] and of acting against Polish interests&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazetawyborcza.pl/1,75478,2618354.html Gazeta Wyborcza ''Usłyszane o Kobylańskim'' 24.03.2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Right wing Polish senators Jan Szafraniec, Ryszard Bender and Czesław Ryszka have since spoken up in his defence. He is a longtime sponsor of privately owned broadcast station [[Radio Maryja]] in Poland.

Kobylański helped to establish 8 June as the "Day of the Polish Settler in Argentina". He helped to fund monuments to [[John Paul II]] in [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Montevideo]], as well as a monument to [[Frédéric Chopin]] in [[Punta del Este]]. He is a sponsor and patron of an elementary school in the region of [[Podlasie]] in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrotapodlasia.pl/pl/archiwum/rok_2005/I_kwartal/krypno.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 1995 Kobylański was awarded with the [[Krzyż Oświęcimski]].

==Accusations==
In 2004, a reporter for ''Gazeta Wyborcza'', Mikołaj Lizut, accused Kobylański of collaborating with the Nazis when Poland was occupied by German forces during World War II, which Kobylański denies. In 2005, the allegations were repeated by a columnist for ''Rzeczpospolita'', Jerzy Morawski. In 2004, the investigative section of the [[Instytut Pamięci Narodowej]] (IPN) began&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipn.gov.pl/wai/pl/18/3039/PRZEGLAD_MEDIOW__22_marca_2005_r.html IPN - review of the media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305162638/http://www.ipn.gov.pl/wai/pl/18/3039/PRZEGLAD_MEDIOW__22_marca_2005_r.html |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; legal proceedings to determine if the accusations of handling over a Jewish family named Szenker to the [[Gestapo]] were true. A person named ''Janusz Kobylański'' was supposedly involved.

In April 2006 the chief of the investigative section of the IPN, Witold Kulesza, reported: "so far, we have not found any evidence of the charges that... Jan Kobylański, handed over to the Germans a married Jewish couple."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/pl/18/3027/PRZEGLAD_MEDIOW__21_kwietnia_2006_r.html ''Informacja szefa pionu śledczego IPN'' - portal IPN]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, the section of IPN in Warsaw reported that it had refused to re-open the investigation. In his explanation, the leading prosecutor recalled the testimonies of witnesses who decided not to testify against Kobylański:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the winter of 1942-1943 Leokadia Sarnowska met Janusz Kobylański(...) During the conversation Janusz Kobylański said, that he was earning money producing false documents for Jews trying to hide themselves. Sarnowska soon sent the Szenker family to Kobylański, which consisted of three people - a married couple and their relative (...) Leokadia Sarnowska arranged the meeting of the two parties, during which Janusz Kobylański told Sarnowska and the Szenkers that false identity documents would be delivered for a certain sum of dollars in gold. The money was delivered to Judge Stanisław Juński, known to Sarnowska, who promised to give them to Kobylański after he delivered the money. Some days after the meeting Kobylański called Sarnowska and said, that the Szenker family had been arrested, and probably executed by the Germans, so he had to destroy the false documents that he had prepared.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Kobylański informed Sarnowska that Judge Juński, on the request of one of Szenkers, handed the money over to a "Polish policeman". Then Kobylański demanded payment from Sarnowska under threat of calling the Germans. Sarnowską delivered a part of the sum to Kobylański at once, and the second part was sent to an office of the father of Janusz Kobylański, att. Stanisław Kobylański (...) After some  time one of the Szenker family called Judge Juński, and asked to arrange a meeting with Sarnowska, who immediately came to Warsaw to meet Szenker. Szenker told her that Kobylański denounced them to the Gestapo. According to his version, Gestapo officers went to the hostel where he stayed with his family, and showed him his personal notes, which he handed to Kobylański, hoping that it would help in the preparation of false documents. The Gestapo men ordered a Polish policeman to escort the Szenkers to the [[ghetto]]. On their way, Szenker convinced the policeman that he should free them for the money held in the judge's office. Policeman took the money from Juński and freed the Szenkers.&lt;ref&gt;http://wyborcza.pl/1,75248,3990821.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stanisław Kobylański worked in Warsaw as a lawyer for the remainder of his life. Jan Kobylański, however, escaped from Poland to Western Europe, probably in 1945.

According to documents collected by the Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw, the evidence that Jan Kobylański was the perpetrator in the denunciation of the Szenkers family cannot be proved. Legal proceedings against Stanisław Kobylański were denied, and those against Janusz Kobylański were suspended by the Regional Court in Warsaw on 31 June 1948. On April 19, 1955, prosecutors decided to cancel the case of Janusz Kobylański.&lt;ref&gt;Information under the justification od Piotr Dąbrowski, prosecutor of the IPN http://wyborcza.pl/1,75248,3990821.html&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutor Paweł Karolak of the IPN investigative section in Warsaw stated that his office was looking for evidence not only in Poland (archives, Museum of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs), but also in Germany (KL Gross-Rosen), Israel, and the United States as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipn.gov.pl/wai.php?serwis=pl&amp;dzial=18&amp;id=4545&amp;search=37093 press service of the IPN]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they found no evidence that "Janusz Kobylański" and "Jan Kobylański" were the same person.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 2005, Mikołaj Lizut wrote in the ''Gazeta Wyborcza'' that Jan Kobylański falsified documents of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], that he was a prisoner at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau|Auschwitz]], [[Mauthausen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], [[Gusen concentration camp|Gusen]], [[Gross Rosen]], and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] concentration camps. Documents used by Kobylański, are different from those in the Auschwitz Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,63546,2618332.html ''Kobylański sfałszował wojenne zaświadczenie'' – Mikołaj Lizut, "Gazeta Wyborcza" (Kraj), 23 marca 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, the minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Radosław Sikorski]], sent a message to Polish embassies abroad to discontinue contact with Kobylański.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/wiadomosc.html?kat=1342&amp;wid=9530368&amp;rfbawp=1199361887.026&amp;ticaid=160d8 ''Szef MSZ zakazał ambasadorom kontaktów z Kobylańskim'', wp.pl]&lt;/ref&gt; In late November 2008, two independent internet services reported that Kobylański was going to open a legal case against Polish politicians and journalists (among others against Adam Michnik, Jerzy Baczyński and Ryszard Schnepf)&lt;ref&gt;http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1348,title,Kobylanski-podal-do-sadu-19-politykow-i-dziennikarzy,wid,10612911,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=170c4&amp;_ticrsn=3&lt;/ref&gt; on charges of slander.

'''Job costing''' is accounting which tracks the costs and revenues by "job" and enables standardized reporting of profitability by job.  For an accounting system to support job costing, it must allow job numbers to be assigned to individual items of expenses and revenues.  A job can be defined to be a specific project done for one customer, or a single unit of product manufactured, or a batch of units of the same type that are produced together.

To apply job costing in a manufacturing setting involves tracking which "job" uses various types of direct expenses such as direct labour and direct materials, and then allocating overhead costs (indirect labor, warranty costs, quality control and other overhead costs) to the jobs.  A job profitability report is like an overall profit &amp; loss statement for the firm, but is specific to each job number.

Job costing may assess all costs involved in a construction "job" or in the manufacturing of goods done in discrete batches. These costs are recorded in ledger accounts throughout the life of the job or batch and are then summarized in the final trial balance before the preparing of the job cost or batch manufacturing statement.

== Job costing vs. process costing ==
Job costing (known by some as job order costing) is fundamental to managerial accounting. It differs from [[Process costing]] in that the flow of costs is tracked by job or batch instead of by process.

The distinction between job costing and process costing hinges on the nature of the product and, therefore, on the type of production process:

== Using job costing ==
Job Costing is the process of determining the labor and materials cost for each job in a systematic way, and then using this information to create a quote for the customer. Job costing or cost accounting can be used in virtually any industry (especially service industry) to ensure that the product pricing covers actual costs,  overhead and provides a profit. The purpose of any business is to make money, and job costing is the most effective way to ensure that occurs.In a job costing system, costs may be accumulated either by job or by batch. For a typical job, direct material, labor, subcontract costs, equipment, and other direct costs are tracked at their actual values. These are accrued until the job or batch is completed. [[Overhead (business)|Overhead]] or "burden" may be applied either by using a rate based on direct labor hours or by using some other [[Activity-based costing|Activity Based Costing (ABC)]] [[cost driver]]. In either case, once overhead/burden is added, the total cost for the job can be determined. If the accountant is using a general ledger accounting system, which lacks true job costing functionality, the costs must be manually transferred out of Work in Process to [[Finished good|Finished Goods]] ([[Cost of goods sold|Cost of Goods Sold]] for service industries). Of course, in the days of computerized job costing software, journaling costs manually is an obsolete process. Such hand-journaling is mandatory for companies that continue to use general accounting software to do job costing. Enlightened accountants are moving forward and using job costing software, thereby improving cost control, reducing risk, and increasing the chance of profitability.

== Using cost codes in budgeting ==

In a true job cost accounting system, a '''Budget''' is set up in advance of the job. As actual costs are accrued, they are compared to budgeted costs, to determine variances for each phase of each job.  '''Cost Codes''' are used for each phase, allowing "mini-budgets" to be generated and tracked. In the construction industry, the [[Construction Specifications Institute]] (CSI) has established an industry standard Cost Coding system. The job costing system consists of various cost drivers that drive job costs.

== Example ==
These examples will assume that overhead is allocated on the basis of Direct Labor Hours. Direct Material is abbreviated DM, Direct Labor as DL, and Overhead as OH.

XYZ corporation manufactures airplanes.  1 order was completed (#110), 2 received further work (#111, 112), and 1 new order was received (#113). Overhead is allocated at a rate of $100/DL Hour. All employees earn $20/hour. Beginning Work In Process Balances are as follows: #110, $25,000; #111, $10,000; #112, $12,000; #113 $0 (New Order). Below are the amounts of DM and DL used.

* #110 $2,000 DM, 25 DL hours. Therefore, $5,000 in new cost is added ($2,000 DM, $500 DL, $2,500 OH). The job had a total cost of $30,000. this amount is transferred out of Work in Process to Finished Goods or Cost of Goods Sold.
* #111 $3,000 DM, 30 DL hours. Therefore, $6,600 in new cost is added ($3,000 DM, $600 DL, $3,000 OH). The job has a new total cost of $16,600. This amount remains in Work in Process until completion.
* #112 $5,000 DM, 100 DL hours. Therefore, $17,000 in new cost is added ($5,000 DM, $2,000 DL, $10,000 OH). The job has a new total cost of $29,000. This amount remains in Work in Process until completion.
* #113 $1,000 DM, 10 DL hours. Therefore, $2,200 in new cost is added ($1,000 DM, $200 DL, $1000 OH). The job has a new total cost of $2,200. This amount remains in Work in Process until completion.

'''Caution:'''  Remember, overhead is allocated on the basis of DL hours. While in this case, allocating overhead on the basis of DL cost ($5 of overhead for every $1 DL cost) would produce the same result, this may not always be the case. Since rates are developed based on a budget, if employees are actually paid a different rate from the budgeted rate, allocating at a $5 to $1 ratio would produce a different cost from the stated $100/DL hour allocation. Companies use slightly different overhead allocation methods.

There have been a great number of '''anamorphic format trade names''', for reasons of prestige, technology, or vanity. The basic [[35&amp;nbsp;mm]] [[anamorphic format]] originally popularized as [[CinemaScope]] has been known by a number of other monikers. In some cases, these names actually refer to different lens designs and technologies implemented; however, the great majority are simply re-branded lenses originally known by another name. In recent decades, it has generally been considered a cliché throwback, and thus the generic name of ''anamorphic format'' has become predominant.

All of the following trade names refer to the modern [[SMPTE]]-standard anamorphic 35&amp;nbsp;mm format or what was regarded as the standard at that time. Generically speaking, this means a 2× anamorphosis lens with 4-perf [[negative pulldown]] for both image origination and projection, and an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 2.35:1 until 1970 (requiring special, narrow "negative assembly" [[film splice|splices]]) and 2.39:1 after 1970 (using conventional "negative assembly" splices). The change from 2.35:1 to 2.39:1 (sometimes rounded to 2.4:1 or, mathematically incorrectly, to 2.40:1) was mainly intended to facilitate "negative assembly", and also to better hide "negative assembly" splices, which otherwise may appear as a slight "flash" at the upper edge of the frame, during a splice. The term ''anamorphic'' should not be considered synonymous with [[widescreen]]; [[VistaVision]] was non-anamorphic, and at the time of shooting, so was [[Techniscope]]
.

'''Logistics in World War I''' was the organising and delivery of supplies to the armed forces of [[World War I]]. 

== Initial stages of the war ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 104-0984A, Bei Etricourt, Truppen auf Landstraße.jpg|thumb|German supply train bottleneck in front of two provisional bridges near [[Étricourt-Manancourt|Étricourt]], France, during [[Operation Michael]], 24 March 1918]]
With the expansion of military [[conscription]] and [[Military reserve force|reserve]] systems in the decades leading up to the 20th century, the potential size of armies increased substantially, while the [[Industrial warfare|industrialization of firepower]] ([[bolt-action rifle]]s with higher rate-of-fire, larger and more artillery, plus [[machine gun]]s) was starting to multiply the potential amount [[munitions]] they required. Military logistical systems, however, continued to rely on 19th century technology.

The main method of transportation of supplies at the start of the war was still by [[horse]] due to the lack of available alternatives in 1914, similar to that of the inclusion of [[cavalry]] within the armed forces, and the fast pace of the war in the first part of the war. When [[World War I]] started, the capabilities of rail and horse-drawn supply were stretched to their limits.  As the war progressed it became increasingly difficult  to supply soldiers in the traditional way by horse and carriage due to conditions at the front. The supply routes became muddy and impassable, improvement to [[artillery]] on both sides and other tactics meant that supplies became increasingly delivered under cover of night and were considerably slowed down.

== Trench warfare and blockade of Germany ==
[[File:Imperial Russian artillery ammunition baskets WWI.jpg|thumb|right|Russian ammunition baskets for heavy artillery shells.  Supplying the artillery of WWI was a challenge which, for Britain, resulted in the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]].]]
However, as the war ground down into static trench warfare it became easier for armies to support their troops with the use of the [[railway]], especially for the artillery. This made the transportation of supplies easier and quicker to get from the factories to the front line. This did have problems of their own, as seen by the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]]. Where the stalemate of [[trench warfare]] took hold, special [[narrow gauge]] [[trench railways]] were built to extend the rail network to the front lines. The great size of the German Army proved too much for its railways to support except while immobile.&lt;ref&gt;Creveld, pp. 138–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Tactical successes like [[Operation Michael]] devolved into operational failures where logistics failed to keep up with the army's advance over shell-torn ground. 

On the seas, the British [[blockade of Germany]] kept a stranglehold on raw materials, goods, and food needed to support Germany's war efforts, and is considered one of the key elements in the eventual Allied victory in the war. On the Allied Side a huge producer of supplies was the [[United States of America]], meaning the supplies had to be transported over the Atlantic Ocean to England and France. At the same time, Germany's [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] showed the vulnerability of shipping lanes despite Allied [[naval superiority]]. This revolutionised how war shipping was conducted and saw the first use of military convoys to counter the threat caused by [[U-boat|German U-Boats]].

In June 1918 the Allies organized the Military Board of Allied Supply, which proved to be an invaluable mechanism for coordinating logistical requirements for armies working in close proximity during the final battles that autumn.  The Board’s report contains overviews of the logistical systems for the principal Allied armies.&lt;ref&gt;“[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000112005 Report of the Military Board of Allied Supply]” 2 vols. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

The trans-Atlantic distances and the American inexperience at large scale operations combined to make support of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) extraordinarily difficult.  Mass production of munitions, including cargo ships, did not reach full potential until near the end of the war.  In the meantime, the United States relied upon European allies for most weapons and upon Britain for shipping.  In France, the Americans built or improved ports, railroads, depots, and other facilities to move the supplies to the front.  Slowly the Americans learned the multiple functions associated with supporting a large-scale conflict, which allowed the AEF to operate as a independent force.  Experience gained in World War I proved invaluable during later conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Leo P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11238">'''Management accounting in supply chains''' (or supply chain controlling, SCC) is part of the [[supply chain management]] concept. This necessitates planning, monitoring, management and information about logistics and manufacturing processes throughout the [[value chain]]. The goal of management accounting in supply chains is optimizing these processes. This strategy focuses on supporting management.

== Overview ==
As value chains become more complex due to globalization, supply chain management (SCM) has become increasingly relevant in theory and practice. SCM encompasses extensive management-control tasks. This range of subjects is summarized by the definition of supply-chain controlling. The transfer of existing [[management control system]]s (MCM) to the SCM is insufficient because these primarily aim at internal (company) needs. Beyond past-oriented, financial figures there must also be future-oriented measurement; a number of approaches exist in the literature.

== Definition ==
Supply-chain management (SCM) has become increasingly relevant in theory and practice in light of more-complex supply chains. The SCM performs extensive operational tasks, including supply-chain controlling. Seuring&lt;ref&gt;Seuring, S. (2006): "Supply chain controlling: summarizing recent developments in German literature", in: ''[[Supply Chain Management: An International Journal]]'', 11/1 (2006), P. 10-14.&lt;/ref&gt; transfers the three main concepts of German supply chain-controlling literature into the specific demands of SCM:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Supply-chain controlling concept
|-
! Criteria !! Rationality-oriented !! Coordination-oriented !! Information-oriented
|-
| Specific problem || Ensuring rationality of supply-chain management || Assuring and maintaining coordination and flexibility in supply chain management || Decision-related information
|-
| Direct controlling objective || Balancing task-related and staff-related bottlenecks
|| System building and coordination of planning and control and providing information throughout the supply chain
|| Implementing of supply-chain-wide information systems
Providing problem-specific information to all participants in the supply chain
|-
| Indirect controlling objective || Performance-objective system || Profit (efficiency, short- and long-term profit)|| Profit and liquidity objectives
|}

The rationality-oriented approach of supply-chain controlling coordinates all participants in the supply chain to improve performance. Common management systems and instruments for performance measurement are developed, enabling guidance for individual companies and the entire supply chain. The coordination-oriented approach supports the supply-chain leadership. Organizational objectives include the selection of strategic partners, the distribution of tasks among companies, process management and ensuring the provision of information to all participants. The information-oriented supply-chain controlling concept emphasizes providing partners with relevant information for decision-making. An efficient reporting structure must be implemented, including strategic and operative organizations in the system and their technical aspects.

== Requirements ==
A requirement for the supply chain is the support of cooperating companies, ensuring future cooperation; companies must focus on common tools and targets. For this, an understanding of processes within the participating companies is indispensable. Information exchange (including sensitive data) within a supply chain is necessary to ensure its control, with coordination among in-house information systems. The requirements for management accounting in supply chains are significantly higher than the provision of key figures, but this is a fundamental task.

== Tasks and functions ==
The tasks and functions of controlling may be transferred to management accounting in supply chains, supplemented by a cross-company approach. However, the past-oriented aspects of the traditional concept are inappropriate. Due to the strategic importance of supply-chain management, forward-looking control requirements must be taken into account. Because of the complexity of a supply chain, a focus on interface management is necessary. In the literature, several tasks and functions are defined. Management accounting in supply chains has the following features:
* Planning
* Monitoring and control
* Information supply
* Coordination
* Rationality and reflection

== Aims ==
Because of different controlling directions, in management accounting of supply chains different aims are pursued and influence each other. Again, the challenge is the cross-company factor. Independent companies must agree on a common strategy for the SCM and define common aims. Two types of aims exist: direct and indirect.

=== {{anchor|Direct aims}}Direct ===
Direct aims relate to the support of SCM and controlling. This ensures logistical processes between parties in a supply chain or the introduction of a common performance-measurement system for verification of lead times.

=== {{anchor|Indirect aims}}Indirect ===
Company-wide, generalized aims may be pursued with management accounting in supply chains. Examples are competitiveness, expanding cooperation, growth, market development and greater customer orientation.

== Instruments ==
Management accounting in supply chains draws on modified traditional instruments of managerial accounting to accomplish cross-company objectives. There are two measuring instruments: the supply-chain map&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, T.; Cooper, M. (2003): “Strategic Supply Chain Mapping Approaches”; in: Journal of Business Logistics, Vol.24/2, 37–64.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[supply-chain operations reference]] (SCOR).&lt;ref&gt;Poluha, R. (2007): “Application of the SCOR Model in Supply Chain Management”, Youngstown, New York 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Supply chain scorecard}}Supply-chain scorecard ===
The basic model of the [[balanced scorecard]] (BSC) was introduced by Kaplan and Norton&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R.; Norton, D. (1992): "The Balanced Scorecard - Measures that Drive Performance", Harvard Business Review, Feb. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992. The BSC aims to achieve a balance between non-financial and financial measures. To use the scorecard in a cross-company context, several modifications of content and structure are necessary. The BSC consists of four generic perspectives, which are geared to the individual company. According to this, a generally accepted framework does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, P.; Speh, T. (2000): “Using the Balanced Scorecard to measure supply chain performance”, in: Journal of Business Logistics, Vol. 21/1, P. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; From a common strategy, the supply-chain scorecard (SCS) maps cross-company measures. Brewer and Speh note that focusing on the supply chain requires four perspectives:&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, P.; Speh, T. (2000): “Using the Balanced Scorecard to measure supply chain performance”, in: Journal of Business Logistics, Vol. 21/1, P. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Financial benefits
* Supply chain-management (SCM) goals
* SCM improvement
* End customer benefits
Independent of perspective, each should include internal and cross-company measures.

=== {{anchor|Cross-company activity based costing}}Cross-company activity-based costing ===
[[Activity-based costing]] is a model to assign indirect costs into direct ones.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, P. (1999): “Management Challenges of the 21st Century.” New York: Harper Business.&lt;/ref&gt; To use this model in the context of supply chains, there must be consistent defined and delimited cost and performance data. Since many companies participate in more than one supply chain, standardization across the sector is beneficial. Compatibility of information technology is important for improved data transfer, so manual entry is limited and high availability guaranteed. Several changes result from cross-company activity-based costing:&lt;ref&gt;Decker, H.C.; Van Goor, A.R. (2000): ““Supply chain management and management accounting: a case study of activity-based costing”, International Journal of Logistics: Research and Applications, Vol. 3 No. 1, pp. 41-52.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Determination of supply-chain efficiency (aggregate of cost and performance data)
* Detailed cost analysis (for decisions)
* Process benchmarking between supply-chain members
* Realization of target costs

=== {{anchor|Supply chain performance measurement system}}Supply-chain performance-measurement system ===
A primary task of management accounting in supply chains is performance measurement. The key elements of strategic goals include the measurement of resources, output and flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;Beamon, B.M. (1999): “Measuring supply chain Performance“, in: International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, Vol. 19 Iss: 3, P. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Efficient resource management is critical to profitability; without an acceptable output, customers will turn to other supply chains. In a changing environment, supply chains must adapt.&lt;ref&gt;Beamon, B.M. (1999): “Measuring supply chain Performance“, in: International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, Vol. 19 Iss: 3, P. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;
Measures for resource performance include total costs, distribution costs, manufacturing costs, measures of inventory and [[rate of return]].&lt;ref&gt;Beamon, B.M. (1999): “Measuring supply chain Performance“, in: International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, Vol. 19 Iss: 3, P. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of performance measures are numbers of items produced, time required to produce, customer satisfaction and product quality (which is difficult to express numerically). Reductions in  back orders, increased customer satisfaction and the ability to accommodate demand variations are advantages associated with flexibility.

He moved to [[Edo]] at 14 years of age, where he was later joined by his brothers Toshigutsu, and Shigetoshi, where he managed to rapidly multiply his capital by first opening a  clothes store (''[[gofukuya]]'' (呉服屋)), then developing a textile retail business. A fall-out with his jealous brothers forced him to return to Matsuzaka at the age of 28, where he remained for two decades.  He returned to Edo on his elder brother Toshigutsu's death in 1673. He then established a ''gofukuya'' in [[Nihonbashi]] (日本橋) the following year, which was to become, later, the head company of the famous [[Mitsukoshi]] retail shopping chain. He subsequently started a money exchange, with a new system for inter-city loans, and died at the age of 73.

'''Moïse Kapenda Tshombe''' (sometimes written Tshombé) (10 November 1919 – 29 June 1969) was a Congolese businessman and politician. He served as the president of the secessionist [[State of Katanga]] from 1960 to 1963 and as prime minister of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 1964 to 1965.

== Early life ==
A member of the [[Lunda people|Lunda tribes]], Tshombe was born near [[Musumba]], [[Belgian Congo]], the son of a successful businessman. He received his education from an American [[missionary]] school and later trained as an accountant. In the 1950s, he took over a chain of stores in [[Katanga Province]] and became involved in politics.

==Political career==
He founded the [[CONAKAT|Confédération des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT) party, with [[Godefroid Munongo]]. CONAKAT promoted a federal Congo independent of the [[Belgian colonial empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qqWIvIAe2h4C The Congo from Leopold to Kabila], Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja, 2002, {{ISBN|1-84277-053-5}}, accessed February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

CONAKAT won control of the Katanga provincial legislature in the May 1960 general elections. One month later, the Congo became an independent republic. Tshombe became President of Katanga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rulers.org/cngkprov.html|title=Congo (Kinshasa) provinces|website=www.rulers.org|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the resulting [[Congo Crisis|strife and chaos following independence]], CONAKAT declared the [[State of Katanga]]'s secession from the rest of the Congo. The Christian, [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] pro-Western Tshombe declared, "We are seceding from chaos." Favoring continued ties with [[Belgium]], he asked the Belgian government to send military officers to recruit and train a Katangese army.

==Independence leader==
[[File:Tshombe with Operation Unokat casualty cropped.jpg|thumb|Tshombe in Katanga, 1962]]
Tshombe demanded [[UN]] recognition for independent Katanga, and he announced that any intervention by UN troops would be met with force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |agency=Reuters |date=21 July 1960 |title=Katanga Premier Warns U.N. Force |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/07/21/99759909.pdf |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Congolese Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]] and his successor, [[Cyrille Adoula]], successfully requested intervention from UN forces. UN forces were sent under the direction of UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld.

Lumumba's government was overthrown, and Lumumba taken prisoner by [[Mobutu]] and detained at Camp Hardy in [[Thysville]]. {{ill|Harold d'Aspremont Lynden|nl|Harold Charles d'Aspremont Lynden}} (Belgian minister for African Affairs) sent a highly confidential telegram on 16 January 1961 to the government in [[Léopoldville]] (President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] and Mobutu) to send Lumumba to Katanga. That would have stemmed from Lumumba's increasing popularity among soldiers, who might release him. Meanwhile, soldier mutinies and unrest increased by the day, at Prison Camp Hardy in Thysville. The telegram has still not been shown to exist.

While being flown in a [[Sabena]] DC-4 air plane to Katanga, Lumumba was beaten by the Congolese soldiers escorting him. In custody in Katanga, Lumumba was visited by Katangese notables and Belgian officers, who included Tshombe, [[Godefroid Munongo]], Kibwe, Kitenge, Grandelet, Son, Gat, Huyghé, Tignée, Verscheure, Segers and Rougefort. Lumumba's execution was carried out by a firing squad led by a Belgian mercenary, Julien Gat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Assassination-Lumumba-Ludo-Witte/dp/1859844103 ''The Assassination of Lumumba''], [[Ludo De Witte]], 2003, {{ISBN|1-85984-410-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Moise Tshombe touring Stanleyville.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister Tshombe touring Stanleyville in 1964]]
In 1963, UN forces succeeded in suppressing Katanga, driving Tshombe into exile in [[Northern Rhodesia]], later to [[Spain]]. In July 1964, he returned to the Congo to serve as prime minister in a new coalition government.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Tshombe's national support was derived from the backing of provincial political bosses, customary chiefs, and foreign financial interests.{{sfn|Semonin|1968|p=20}} He was dismissed from his position in October 1965 by President Kasa-Vubu. In late 1965, General Mobutu, who had staged a successful coup against Kasa-Vubu, brought charges of treason against Tshombe, who again fled the country and settled in [[Francoist Spain]].

In 1967, he was sentenced to death ''in absentia''. On 30 June 1967, he was in a [[British Aerospace BAe 125|Hawker Siddeley jet aircraft]] that was [[aircraft hijacking|hijack]]ed by Francis Bodenan, an agent of the [[SDECE]] of [[France]]. According to the Congolese government, Tshombe was going to Africa.&lt;ref name = "gibb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibbs | first = David N.  | title = The Political Economy of Third World Intervention | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 1991 | pages = 152, 167–168 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NgN64EXv8mgC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=Moise+Tshombe#PPA168,M1 | isbn = 0-226-29071-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tshombe was taken to [[Algeria]], jailed, and placed under house arrest. The pilots of the plane, Britons Trevor Coppleston and David Taylor, were released and returned to the United Kingdom. The Congolese government demanded his extradition to Congo, and his Western supporters agitated for his release.&lt;ref name = "gibb"/&gt; The Algerians resisted both demands.

Tshombe died in 1969, the official cause of death was listed as "death from heart failure".

'''Muna Khalif''' ({{lang-so|Muna Khalif Sheekh Abuu}}, {{lang-ar|منى خليف}}), popularly known as '''Muna Kay''',&lt;ref name="Divp"/&gt; is a [[Somalis|Somali]]-[[United States|American]] entrepreneur, fashion designer and legislator. She is the founder and CEO of the Muna Kay brand. Khalif also serves as an MP in the [[Federal Parliament of Somalia]].

==Personal life==
[[File:Munaaaa.jpg|thumb|Muna Khalif wearing one of her Muna Kay brand modern [[jilbāb]] designs.]]
Khalif was born Muna Khalif Sheikh Abuu in [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Entr"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Entrepreneurship - The Fashion Designer with a Big Dream|url=https://www.joomag.com/magazine/the-somalia-investor-magazine-vol-1i-issue-4i-2015/0526831001452766078?page=38|journal=The Somalia Investor|volume=1|issue=4|date=October–December 2015|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fedparl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Four More MPs Elected to the Lower House in Baidoa|url=https://unsom.unmissions.org/four-more-mps-elected-lower-house-baidoa|publisher=UN|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family is from the Tuni clan.&lt;ref name="Fedparl"/&gt; After the civil war broke out in her place of birth, she and her parents emigrated to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Divp"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia to usher in most diversed Parliament in History|url=http://iftiimin.com/?p=565|publisher=Iftiimin|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalif studied nursing at college. She later also took courses in fashion design.&lt;ref name="Entr"/&gt; Khalif is [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="Entr"/&gt;

==Career==
===Muna Kay===
Khalif is the founder and CEO of Muna Kay, an eponymous clothing line that caters to the Islamic market. She established the brand in order to provide young Muslim women with fashionable attire that adheres to prescribed standards of modesty. Khalif later launched Baby Norah, an infant garment collection named after her daughter.&lt;ref name="Entr"/&gt;

As of 2016, the Muna Kay company operates internationally, with retail outlets in [[North America]], [[East Africa]] and [[Dubai]]. It also has a manufacturing hub in [[China]].&lt;ref name="Entr"/&gt;

Additionally, Khalif is the president of the Muna Kay Foundation. The philanthropic organization offers help to the disadvantaged, and provides artisanal training and mentorship to women and girls.&lt;ref name="Entr"/&gt;

===Federal Parliament of Somalia===
[[File:2016 16 Youth Workshop-6 (30821301124).jpg|thumb|Federal legislator Muna Khalif chairing a political workshop.]]
In November 2016, Khalif presented herself as a candidate for a legislative seat in the Lower House of the [[Federal Parliament of Somalia]]. She was elected a representative for the [[South West State of Somalia|South West State]], earning 41 ballots.&lt;ref name="Fedparl"/&gt;

An electoral oversight body later called for a reelection on the grounds that Khalif and seven other MPs had not met the ballot threshold. The Supreme Court upheld this ruling. However, the decision was eventually overturned by the Federal Parliament, with the Lower House instead authorizing the incumbency of Khalif and the other lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judiciary set for supremacy war as House ‘annuls’ Court ruling over election of 8 MPs|url=http://garsoornews.com/mararkamaantay/judiciary-set-for-supremacy-war-as-house-annuls-court-ruling-over-election-of-8-mps/|publisher=Garsoor Online|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MySuper''' is part of the Stronger Super&lt;ref name="stronger"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://strongersuper.treasury.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=reforms.htm |title=Stronger Super Overview of Reforms| author=Federal Government |accessdate=21 February 2013 |date=1 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reforms announced in September 2011 by the [[Gillard government|Gillard Labor government]] for the [[Superannuation in Australia|Australian superannuation industry]] to replace the previous default funds system with a new default system using low cost and simple superannuation products. MySuper compliant products may be provided by [[industry superannuation fund|industry super funds]], as well as retail super funds. Funds that do not operate as default funds, such as self managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) or choice products, are not subject to MySuper standards.

Since 1 January 2014, unless an employee has chosen another investment option, employers must pay all compulsory SG contributions into approved MySuper accounts, ie., into super products that have received a MySuper authority. From that date, super funds must also credit employer contributions to a MySuper account, unless if the member has directed the trustee to do otherwise. Given that over 75% of employees stay with their employers’ default fund, it was expected that the majority of employees would be in a MySuper product from that date. Superannuation funds had until 1 July 2017 to move existing default members into a complying MySuper product. For convenience, many funds simply converted an existing default option to a MySuper account, so that members would be automatically included in a MySuper product. 

Members can opt out of the MySuper option at any time, or may chose a particular MySuper product. They must be given a minimum of 90 days' notice before a default transfer to a MySuper account is made.

The intention of the MySuper system is for market participants to create a range of easily comparable, relatively simple products, which in turn will focus competition on net costs and returns. The [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]] (APRA) fosters competition by publishing fee tables and other statistics.&lt;ref name="compare"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.apra.gov.au/publications/quarterly-mysuper-statistics |title=Quarterly MySuper Statistics |first= |last= |accessdate=7 October  2018 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of a MySuper account==
The features of a MySuper product include:
* a single investment option
* a minimum level of insurance cover
* an easily comparable fee structure, with a short prescribed list of allowable fee types
* restrictions on how advice is provided and paid for, and
* rules governing fund governance and transparency.&lt;ref name="guidelines"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.apra.gov.au/Super/Pages/Superannuation-reforms-2011-2013.aspx |title=Superannuation reforms 2011–2013 |author=APRA |accessdate=21 February 2013 |date=12 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MySuper investments===
MySuper products are required to have a single investment option.  Many funds, such as HESTA and CBUS, have announced that they will simply use their existing default investment option as their MySuper offering – typically Balanced or Growth.&lt;ref name="hesta"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hesta.com.au/employers/mysuper.html |title=HESTA's MySuper Option | author=HESTA|accessdate=19 March 2013 |date=19 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 80% of not-for-profit funds will reportedly retain their existing products for MySuper.&lt;ref name="SMH MySuper"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/money/super-and-funds/mysuper-unleashes-competition-and-value-20120921-26bsk.html |title=MySuper unleashes competition and value| first=Annette| last=Sampson |accessdate=8 April 2013 |date=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables a simple transition to the MySuper regime.  However, critics of this approach argue that offering a single investment option that doesn't change over an entire working life and into retirement does not reflect customers' changing attitudes to risk as they age nor as their retirement prospects change.

====Lifecycle investment strategies====
For these reasons, the government has allowed lifecycle investment options to be the default choice for a MySuper product. Lifecycle investment options enable trustees to automatically move members into a different investment mix based on their age and other permitted factors including balance, gender, time to retirement (or combination thereof), and can be particularly relevant as part of a transition to retirement.&lt;ref name="lifecycle"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://strongersuper.treasury.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=publications/information_pack/mysuper.htm |title=Stronger Super| author=Treasury Department |accessdate=19 March 2013 |date=19 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sunsuper]] was the first fund to receive approval for their lifecycle strategy.&lt;ref name="Sunsuper 2000 hours"/&gt; However, a number of lifecycle strategies have since been released from companies including Aon, Suncorp, BT and First State.

===MySuper fees===
Fees a member can be charged in MySuper products are limited to:

* administration fee
* investment fee (including a performance-based fee)
* buy and sell spreads (limited to cost recovery)
* exit fee (limited to cost recovery), and 
* switching fee (limited to cost recovery).&lt;ref name="lifecycle"/&gt;
 
In addition, trustees may charge fees for certain member‑specific costs initiated by the member or a court; for example, account splitting following a family law decision.  
 
All fees charged for MySuper products must be able to be included under these standard descriptions. This will make it simpler for members to understand what they pay and to compare fees against other MySuper products.

===MySuper insurance===
MySuper products are required to offer a standard, default level of life and total and permanent disability (TPD) insurance. Members of MySuper products are able to opt-out of the insurance, or increase or decrease their insurance cover (if offered by the trustee) without having to leave the MySuper product.
 
There may be particular factors at a workplace level that influence the appropriate level and structure of insurance for employees at that workplace. Therefore, within a MySuper product, it is possible for the standard insurance cover to be replaced by a default insurance strategy tailored to meet the specific requirements of the employees of a particular employer.&lt;ref name="lifecycle"/&gt;

'''Nicolae Popa''' (born circa 1965) is a controversial Romanian businessman. In 2006 he was sentenced [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] to 15 years in jail for fraud and embezzlement related to the 2000 collapse of the [[Fondul Naţional de Investiţii]] (FNI) [[ponzi scheme]] with an estimated prejudice of 1.2 million euros spread between some 130,000 investors. This sentence is final; all appeals have been exhausted. Popa has also been sentenced to 12 years in jail for a different affair, [[Fondului Naţional de Acumulare]] (FNA), but this decision may still be appealed. On the run since 2002, Popa was apprehended in December 2009 in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. [[Sorin Ovidiu Vântu]], a high-profile businessman and owner of several newspapers and television stations, declared after Popa's apprehension that he still considers Popa a friend and that the sentences are "a giant manipulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.capital.ro/articol/omul-lui-vantu-de-la-fni-popa-nicolae-prins-la-jakarta-128820.html Omul lui Vântu de la FNI, Popa Nicolae, prins la Jakarta]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/eveniment/FNI_-_ultimul_act_0_164384182.html FNI – ultimul act]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final televised debate of the [[Romanian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], Popa's arrest was used as political ammunition by the incumbent president [[Traian Băsescu]] against runoff rival [[Mircea Geoană]], after the latter met with Vântu the night before the debate just after news of Popa's apprehension broke out.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/basescu-l-a-intrebat-pe-geoana-despre-intalnirea-de-miercuri-seara-cu-vantu-5152306 Băsescu l-a întrebat pe Geoană despre întâlnirea de miercuri seară cu Vântu]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pascault Row''' is a national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]]. It consists of a range of eight {{frac|3|1|2}}-story dwellings.  It is Baltimore's last remaining example of early-19th-century townhouses, and illustrates the transition between the Federal and the early Greek Revival periods.  They are attributed to [[William F. Small]], at that time employed in the architectural office of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]].&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-117.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Pascault Row|date=November 1972|accessdate=2016-03-01 |author=Elinor D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17742">{{Insolvency}}

'''Provisional liquidation''' is a process which exists as part of the [[insolvency|corporate insolvency]] laws of a number of [[common law jurisdictions]] whereby after the lodging of a petition for the [[winding-up]] of a [[company]] by the court, but before the court hears and determines the petition, the court may appoint a liquidator on a "provisional" basis.&lt;ref name=Practical&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/3-384-0074?service=finance |title=Provisional liquidation: a quick guide |publisher=Practical Law |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The provisional liquidator is appointed to safeguard the assets of the company and maintain the ''[[status quo]]'' pending the hearing of the petition.)  Unlike a conventional [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]], a provisional liquidator does not assess claims against the company or try to distribute the company's assets to [[creditor]]s.&lt;ref name=Worrells&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worrells.net.au/InsolvencyResources/FactsheetArticle.aspx?ArticleId=14 |title=Provisional Liquidation |publisher=Worrells |author= |date=25 September 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator involve some type of allegation of [[fraud]] or other misconduct relating to the company.&lt;ref name=Fraud&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=159e63e1-69ec-43c9-af12-e9b516fc0f01|title=Provisional liquidation and fraud |publisher=Lexology|author=Steven Fennell and Darren Bradshaw|date=19 June 2013|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

Typically, an application for the appointment of a provisional liquidator is made by either:&lt;ref name=Worrells /&gt;
# a creditor, where they are concerned that the assets of the company are at risk or might be dissipated or put beyond the reach of creditors during the period before the winding up application is heard;
# the shareholders, where they are concerned that the [[board of directors|directors of the company]] are acting improperly; or
# the company itself.  This may arise due to a dispute between directors and other officers, or because the company is insolvent and the directors do not want to risk insolvent trading claims in the period before an official liquidator is appointed.  In some jurisdictions (but not all) the company may apply to put itself into provisional liquidation to shield itself from creditor claims whilst it tries to implement a [[restructuring]].

The remedy is an exceptional one, and most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator are made because of concerns about some type of material impropriety.&lt;ref name=Fraud /&gt;  In exceptional cases it is also possible for public authorities to apply for the appointment of a provisional liquidator to protect the public interest from fraud or other similar conduct, although this is much less common.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite bailii|litigants=Re Treasure Traders Corporation Ltd|year=2005|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=2774}}, in which the company was operating an unlawful lottery.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court invariably has a discretion whether to appoint a provisional liquidator.  A court will not normally approve the application unless it is satisfied that there is a strong liklihood that a liquidator will be appointed on the substantive application.  But even if the company is likely to go into liquidation, provisional liquidation is still an exceptional interim or "emergency remedy".&lt;ref name=Kill &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3harecourt.com/assets/asset-store/file/articles/Lewis-Yousuf.pdf |title=Provisional liquidations - kill or cure? |publisher=Business Rescue |author=Daniel Lewis and Nyla Yousuf |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There needs to be special reasons for the appointment of a provisional liquidator in the interim period.  Normally this is because the assets must face a high risk of dissipation or there must be some other urgent reason why a liquidator is required for the interim period.&lt;ref name=Clayton &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claytonutz.com/area_of_law/restructuring_and_insolvency/docs/ProvisionalLiquid.pdf |title=Restructuring &amp; Insolvency - Provisional liquidation |publisher=[[Clayton Utz]] |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications are most likely to be granted in situations where:&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt;
* it is necessary to have an independent person investigate the company and its affairs;
* there was an urgent need to act to preserve assets of the company;
* there was a material [[conflict of interest]] between a director and the company; or
* there had been impropriety in the conduct of company’s affairs.

Conversely, because there needs to be some urgency or risk of dissipation of assets, applications are likely to be refused if:&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt;
* the only reason relied on by a creditor was that the company was insolvent (without more);
* an [[administrative receiver]] or [[administrator (law)|administrator]] had already been appointed, negating the risk of dissipation of assets;
* the application was made for an improper purpose, such as to maximise the applicant’s own position;
* the application was made simply to try and permit the company to continue to trade where the company is insolvency and clearly should be wound up; or
* there was a genuine dispute as to the creditor’s debt.

Given their nature, applications for provisional liquidation are often made urgently and without giving notice to the company or its directors.  Where the application is made without notice:&lt;ref name=Practical /&gt;
# the applicant is under a duty to give "full and frank disclosure" to the court of all material facts (including any facts which are adverse to the applicant); and
# the applicant will normally have to give an undertaking in damages to compensate the company for any loss caused if it subsequently transpires after a full hearing that the order should not have been.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Highfield Commodities Ltd'' [1984] BCLC 623.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect==

If the court makes the order then a provisional liquidator is appointed over the company, and the control of all assets of the company, and the conduct of any business and other affairs of the company are transferred to the provisional liquidator.  The directors cease to have any authority.&lt;ref name=Worrells /&gt;  In almost all jurisdictions, the provisional liquidator will normally have to be a licensed insovency practitioner.   

The provisional liquidator will generally only have the powers and functions conferred upon him or her by the order of the court.  It is not normally part of the role of a provisional liquidator to collect and sell the assets of the company, or otherwise take steps in relation to the actual winding up the company.  The principal reason for the appointment is the preservation of the company's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=Ashborder BV v Green Gas Power Ltd|year=2005|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the common functions of a provisional liquidator is to investigate whether the company's property has been misappropriated or its business has been wrongfully conducted.  But generally speaking a provisional liquidator will not have power to bring proceedings on behalf of the company for [[wrongful trading]], or to challenge transactions as [[undervalue transaction]]s or [[unfair preference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bailii|litigants=In the matter of Overnight Limited|year=2009|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==

Provisional liquidation will normally come to an end in one of three ways:&lt;ref name=Practical /&gt;
# a full winding up order is made;
# an order of the court is made discharging the provisional liquidation (normally at an ''inter partes'' hearing to challenge the original appointment); or
# the winding up petition itself is dismissed.

==Specific jurisdictions==

The effect of provisional liquidation varies from jurisdiction to the jurisdiction.

===Australia===

{{Main|Australian insolvency law}}

In Australia provisional liquidation is regulated by section 472(2) of [[Corporations Act 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s472.html|title=Corporations Act 2001, section 472|accessdate=30 July 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Australia provisional liquidators must be licensed insolvency practitioners.&lt;ref name=Worrells /&gt;

===British Virgin Islands===

{{Main|British Virgin Islands bankruptcy law}}

Under British Virgin Islands law provisional liquidation is regulated by section 170(4) of the Insolvency Act 2003.&lt;ref name=BVI&gt;{{cite book|title=British Virgin Islands Commercial Law|author=[[Harney Westwood &amp; Riegels]]|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|edition=3rd|year=2014|isbn=9789626615294|at=7.073}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Akai Holdings Limited v Brinlow Investments Limited''&lt;ref&gt;(BVIHCV 2006/0134) at [44] onwards.&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that an applicant would need to show four things:
# a petition before the court for the appointment of a liquidator;
# a good arguable case that a ground for the appointment of a liquidator exists;
# a good arguable case that the applicant has the necessary standing; and
# that the court should exercise its discretion to maintain the ''status quo'' in relation to the company’s assets.

===Canada===

In Canada provision liquidation is regulated under section 28 of the Winding-up and Restructuring Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. W-11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/w-11/page-8.html |title=Winding-up and Restructuring Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. W-11) |publisher=Justice Laws Website |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cayman Islands===

{{Main|Cayman Islands bankruptcy law}}

In the Cayman Islands provisional liquidation is principally regulated by section 104(3) of the Companies Law (2013) Revision.  One unusual feature of provisional liquidation in Cayman is that it is possible to appoint a provisional liquidator and still allow the directors to retain their powers of management.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Winding Up Rules (2008 Revision), Order 4, rule 7(3).&lt;/ref&gt;  This in part facilitates a slightly unusual use of provisional liquidation in the Cayman Islands as part of a [[debtor in possession]] corporate rehabilitation prcoess.  The company itself will apply for an order for provisional liquidation, and provisional liquidators are appointed which effectively creates a stay on the claims of [[unsecured creditor]]s.  The  board of directors can then use that "breathing space" to try and implement a restructuring of the company's debts pursuant to a [[scheme of arrangement]], or pursuant to an international restructuring process in the courts of another jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=Maples &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maplesandcalder.com/news/article/cayman-islands-provisional-liquidations-in-support-of-chapter-11-proceedings-433/ |title=Cayman Islands Provisional Liquidations in Support of Chapter 11 Proceedings |publisher=[[Maples and Calder]] |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach has not been rejected in the courts of other jurisdictions (such as Hong Kong),&lt;ref name=Legend &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationallawoffice.com/newsletters/detail.aspx?g=f806367c-2c17-db11-8a10-00065bfd3168 |title=Corporate Rescue: The Need for Legislation |publisher=International Law Office |author=Andrew Kinnison and Jacky Yeung |date=4 August 2006 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but accepted in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&amp;pg=PT136&amp;lpg=PT136&amp;dq=new+zealand+law+provisional+liquidation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-jp6iPhZb&amp;sig=mwLDD1xUQfxnM6jdHn3ywmCg6Lg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20zealand%20law%20provisional%20liquidation&amp;f=false |title=Principles of International Insolvency |publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] |author=Philip R. Wood |isbn=9781847032102 |year=2007 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===

In Hong Kong there are three types of provisional liquidators.&lt;ref name=BWF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briscoewongferrier.com/web2/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ProvisionalLiquidators1.pdf |title=Provisional Liquidators |publisher=Briscoe Wong Ferrier |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are "traditional" provisional liquidators, appointed under section 193 of the Hong Kong Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32); there are also provisional liquidators appointed pursuant to a members' voluntary liquidation under section 228A of the Ordinance, and there are "Panel T" appointments under section 194(1A) of the Ordinance whereby the Official Receiver is appointed as provisional liquidator.  

Since the decision in the ''Legend'' case in 2006&lt;ref&gt;''Re Legend International Resorts Ltd'' [2006] 2 HKLRD 192&lt;/ref&gt; provisional liquidation may not be used as a means of shielding the company from creditor's claims to facilitate a restructuring in Hong Kong,&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt; although prior to that date the practice was relatively common.&lt;ref name=BWF /&gt;

===South Africa===

In South Africa "provisional liquidation" has a very different meaning.  When a creditor or other person applies to the court for the liquidation of a business, then the order is first made a provisional basis, and then subsequent confirmed (or not) at a full hearing, much like a ''decree nisi'' and a ''decree absolut'' in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findanattorney.co.za/content_business-liquidation|title=Liquidating a Business in South Africa|publisher=FindanAttorney|author=Nanika Prinsloo|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|United Kingdom insolvency law}}
In the United Kingdom the power to appoint a provisional liquidator is found in section 135(1), of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]], and it is regarded as an "emergency procedure".&lt;Ref name=Practical /&gt;  The categories of persons who may apply for the appointment are set out at rule 4.25(1) of the Insolvency Rules 1986.&lt;ref&gt;SI 1925 of 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under English law all provisional liquidators are required to be licensed insolvency practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 1986, section 388(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; 
If, upon the application for the appointment of a liquidator, there are concerns about potential dissipation of assets, or misconduct on the part of the directors, then the court may order the appointment of a [[provisional liquidator]].&lt;ref name=PL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/3-384-0074?service=finance |title=Provisional liquidation: a quick guide |publisher=Practical Law |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Provisional liquidation is essentially an 
"emergency procedure".  A provisional liquidator may only be appointed by the court only after a winding-up petition has been presented&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 1986 s 135(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  The main reason for appointing a provisional liquidator is normally to preserve the company's assets.  In practice most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator involve some kind of [[fraud]] or other misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=159e63e1-69ec-43c9-af12-e9b516fc0f01|title=Provisional liquidation and fraud |publisher=Lexology|author=Steven Fennell and Darren Bradshaw|date=19 June 2013|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The applicant will normally need to show that (a) it is likely that a winding up order will be made at the hearing of the petition; and (b) the company's assets are at risk prior to the hearing of the petition (which includes either dissipation of the company's assets, or the potential loss or destruction of the company's books and records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=Revenue &amp; Customs v Rochdale Drinks Distributors Ltd|year=2011|court=EWCA|division=Civ|num=1116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, it will normally be necessary to establish either (or both) that: (a) the company is clearly insolvent, and it is likely that a winding up order will be made at the hearing of the petition; and/or (b) there has been the type of misconduct that would justify a just and equitable winding-up.  An appointment of a provisional liquidator may also be made where it is in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bailii|litigants=Re Treasure Traders Corporation Ltd|year=2005|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=2774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the emergency nature of the remedy applications for provisional liquidation are very often made urgently and without giving notice to the company.  In such cases the applicant is under a legal obligation to give full and frank disclosure to the court of all material facts, including facts which are adverse to the applicant's own case.  The applicant will also normally be required to give an undertaking in damages in the event the court subsequently determines that the order should not have been made to compensate the company for any damage caused to it by the appointment.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Highfield Commodities Ltd'' [1984] BCLC 623.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a provisional liquidator is appointed then the powers of the company's directors are effectively terminated, and the board will retain only a residual power to apply to dismiss or resist the winding-up petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bailii|litigants=Ashborder BV v Green Gas Power Ltd|year=2005|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The appointment of a provisional liquidator comes to an end when:&lt;ref name=PL /&gt;
# a liquidator is appointed at a full hearing;
# the provisional liquidator is discharged by order of the court; or
# the underlying winding up petition is dismissed.

==Early life and education ==
Khurana was born in India and was raised in Queens, New York.&lt;ref name="Harvard Gazette"/&gt; He received his bachelor's degree in [[Industrial Relations]] from [[Cornell University]],&lt;ref name="Bihar"/&gt; his [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] in sociology from Harvard in 1998, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Organizational Behavior through a joint program between Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Business School in 1998.&lt;ref name="Bihar"/&gt;

==Career==
Khurana is a founding team member of [[Cambridge Technology Partners]] and from 1998 to 2000 he taught at  [[MIT]].&lt;ref name="Bihar"/&gt;   Khurana is the author of the book, ''Searching for a Corporate Savior: The Irrational Quest for Charismatic CEOs'' and related academic and managerial articles on the pitfalls of [[charismatic leadership]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In 2007 he published his second book ''From Higher Aims to Hired Hands: The Social Transformation of American Business Schools and the Unfulfilled Promise of Management as a Profession'' (Princeton University Press).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The book received the Max Weber prize from the American Sociological Association's Organizations, Occupations, and Work Section and was the Winner of the 2009 Gold Medal Axiom Business Book Award in Career, Jenkins Group, Inc. and the Winner of the 2007 Best Professional/Scholarly Publishing Book in Business, Finance and Management, Association of American Publishers and the Finalist for the George R. Terry Award from the Academy of Management.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

He is the co-editor of the Handbook of Leadership Theory and Practice (2010), published by [[Harvard Business School Press]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=36889|title=Handbook of Leadership Theory and Practice|publisher=Harvard Business School Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Handbook for Teaching Leadership: Knowing, Doing and Being, (2012), published by [[Sage Publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book235126|title=The Handbook for Teaching Leadership - SAGE Publications Inc|publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dean of Harvard College===
In July 2014 he became Dean of Harvard College.&lt;ref name="Harvard Gazette"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/07/a-dream-quietly-imagined-come-true/|title=A dream, ‘quietly imagined,’ come true|work=Harvard Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May, 2016, Harvard announced severe restrictions on undergraduates who belong to fraternities or gender-exclusive organizations not formally affiliated with the College, some of which are known as "final clubs."  Some of these have existed as such for more than 200 years, but Harvard began to admit women undergraduates only in 1977.  Dean Khurana had worked with Harvard's President, Drew Gilpin Faust, to develop the new policy.  Khurana, according to the "Washington Post," said that the exclusion of women practiced by the clubs has no place in the 21st century.  The restrictions on students belonging to these clubs include ineligibility for leadership positions in student organizations affiliated with Harvard, such as sports teams, and ineligibility for required Harvard endorsement for fellowships such as Rhodes and Marshall fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/harvard-to-bar-members-of-all-male-clubs-from-certain-roles/2016/05/06/a3875ac4-139c-11e6-a9b5-bf703a5a7191_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By mid-August 2018, Dean Khurana's black-listing of "unrecognized social organizations," rather than ameliorating the exclusion of women, had in fact eliminated four out of four sororities and three of five traditionally female clubs available to Harvard women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/8/19/last-sorority-alpha-phi-co-ed/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Specification by example''' ('''SBE''') is a collaborative approach to defining [[software requirement|requirement]]s and business-oriented [[functional test]]s for software products based on capturing and illustrating requirements using realistic examples instead of abstract statements. It is applied in the context of [[agile software development]] methods, in particular [[behavior-driven development]]. This approach is particularly successful for managing requirements and functional tests on large-scale projects of significant domain and organisational complexity.&lt;ref name="Adzic11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adzic|first=Gojko|authorlink=Gojko Adzic|title=Specification by example: How successful teams deliver the right software|publisher=Manning|year=2011|isbn=9781617290084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specification by example is also known as example-driven development, executable requirements, [[acceptance test–driven development]] (ATDD&lt;ref name="Pugh11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pugh|first=Ken|title=Lean-Agile Acceptance Test Driven Development: Better Software Through Collaboration: A Tale of Lean-Agile Acceptance Test Driven Development|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=2011|isbn=978-0-321-71408-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or A-TDD&lt;ref name="Larman10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Larman|first=Craig|last2=Vodde|first2=Bas|title=Practices for Scaling Lean and Agile Development: Large, Multisite, and Offshore Product Development with Large-Scale Scrum|publisher=Pearson|year=2010|isbn=978-0-321-63640-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Agile Acceptance Testing,&lt;ref name="Adzic09"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adzic|first=Gojko|authorlink=Gojko Adzic|title=Bridging the Communication Gap: Specification by Example and Agile Acceptance Testing|publisher=Neuri|year=2009|isbn= 0-9556836-1-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test-Driven Requirements (TDR).

==Advantages==
Human brains are generally not that great at understanding abstractions or novel ideas/concepts when first exposed to them, but they’re really good at deriving abstractions or concepts if given enough concrete examples.{{citation needed|reason=I have no memory of where I read this|date=February 2016}} The more examples we are given, the more likely we are to correctly understand the intended meaning. Also, by using ''concrete'' examples, they become more familiar and relatable to something similar to our past experiences, which generally makes them easier to understand.

Successful application of Specification by example is documented&lt;ref name="Adzic11" /&gt; to significantly reduce feedback loops in software development, leading to less rework, higher product quality, faster turnaround time for software changes and better alignment of activities of various roles involved in software development such as testers, analysts and developers.

==Examples as a single source of truth==
A key aspect of specification by example is creating a [[single source of truth]] about required changes from all perspectives. When [[business analyst]]s work on their own documents, [[software developer]]s maintain their own documentation and testers maintain a separate set of functional tests, [[software delivery]] effectiveness is significantly reduced by the need to constantly coordinate and synchronise those different versions of truth. With short iterative cycles, such coordination is often required on weekly or biweekly basis. With Specification by example, different roles participate in creating a single source of truth that captures everyone's understanding. Examples are used to provide clarity and precision, so that the same information can be used both as a [[specification]] and a business-oriented functional test. Any additional information discovered during development or delivery, such as clarification of functional gaps, missing or incomplete requirements or additional tests, is added to this single source of truth. As there is only one source of truth about the functionality, there is no need for coordination, translation and interpretation of knowledge inside the delivery cycle.

When applied to required changes, a refined set of examples is effectively a specification and a business-oriented [[Acceptance testing|test for acceptance]] of software functionality. After the change is implemented, specification with examples becomes a document explaining existing functionality. As the validation of such documents is automated, when they are validated frequently, such documents are a reliable source of information on business functionality of underlying software. To distinguish between such documents and typical printed documentation, which quickly gets outdated,&lt;ref name="Adzic09" /&gt; a complete set of specifications with examples is called Living Documentation.&lt;ref name="Adzic11" /&gt;

==Key practices==
Teams that apply Specification by example successfully commonly apply the following process patterns:&lt;ref name="Adzic11" /&gt;
*Deriving scope from goals
*Specifying collaboratively - through all-team specification workshops, smaller meetings or teleconference reviews 
*Illustrating requirements using examples
*Refining specifications
*Automating tests based on examples
*Validating the underlying software frequently using the tests
*Evolving a documentation system from specifications with examples to support future development

Software teams that apply specification by example within a Scrum framework typically spend 5%-10% of their time in refining the product backlog, including specifying collaboratively, illustrating requirements using examples and refining examples.&lt;ref name="Larman10"/&gt;

==Applicability==
Specification by example applies to projects with sufficient organisational and domain complexity to cause problems in understanding or communicating requirements from a business domain perspective. It does not apply to purely technical problems or where the key complexity is not in understanding or communicating knowledge. There are documented usages of this approach in domains including investment banking, financial trading, insurance, airline ticket reservation, online gaming and price comparison.&lt;ref name="Adzic11" /&gt; A similar approach is documented also in a nuclear-power plant simulation project.&lt;ref name="Larman10" /&gt;

Tests based on shared examples fit best in the category of tests designed to support a team while delivering software from a business perspective (see Agile Testing Quadrants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crispin|first=Lisa|authorlink=Lisa Crispin|last2=Gregory|first2=Janet|title=Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=2008|isbn=978-0-321-53446-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) - ensuring that the right product is built. They do not replace tests that look at a software system from a purely technical perspective (those that evaluate whether a product is built the right way, such as unit tests, component or technical integration tests) or tests that evaluate a product after it was developed (such as security penetration tests).

==History==
The earliest documented usage of realistic examples as a single source of truth, requirements and automated tests, on software projects is the WyCash+ project, described by [[Ward Cunningham]] in the paper A Pattern Language of Competitive Development &lt;ref name="Cunningham06"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pattern Languages of Program Design 2|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1996|isbn=978-0-201-89527-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cunningham06-2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ward Cunningham |url=http://c2.com/ppr/episodes.html |title=EPISODES: A Pattern Language of Competitive Development Part I |publisher=C2.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996. The name Specification by Example was coined by [[Martin Fowler]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Fowler 18 March 2004 |url=http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SpecificationByExample.html |title=SpecificationByExample |publisher=Martinfowler.com |date=2004-03-18 |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specification by Example is an evolution of the Customer Test&lt;ref name="Beck99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=K.|authorlink=Kent Beck|title=Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1999|isbn=978-0-321-27865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; practice of [[Extreme Programming]] proposed in 1999 and Ubiquitous Language&lt;ref name="Evans04"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Evans (technologist)|title=Domain-Driven Design:Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software |publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=2004|isbn= 0-321-12521-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; idea from [[Domain-driven design]] from 2004, using the idea of black-box tests as requirements described by Weinberg and Gause&lt;ref name="Weinberg89"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Gerald|last2=Gause|first2=Donald|authorlink=Gerald_Weinberg|title=Exploring Requirements: Quality Before Design|publisher=Dorset House|year=1989|isbn= 0-932633-13-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989.

==Automation==
Successful application of Specification by example on large scale projects requires frequent validation of software functionality against a large set of examples (tests). In practice, this requires tests based on examples to be automated. A common approach is to automate the tests but keep examples in a form readable and accessible to non-technical and technical team members, keeping the examples as a single source of truth. This process is supported by a class of test automation tools which work with tests divided into two aspects - the specification and the automation layer. The specification of a test which is often in a plain text or HTML form and contains the examples and auxiliary descriptions. The automation layer connects the example to a software system under test. Examples of such tools are:
*[[Behat (computer science)|Behat]]
*[[Concordion]]
*[[Cucumber (software)|Cucumber]]
*[[FitNesse]]
*[[Framework for Integrated Test]]
*[[Robot Framework]]
*[[Gauge (software)]]

==Definition==
[[File:Strategic Management Framework.png|thumb|300px|Strategic management processes and activities]]

'''Strategic management''' involves the formulation and implementation of the major goals and initiatives taken by a company's top management on behalf of owners, based on consideration of [[Factors of production|resources]] and an assessment of the internal and external environments in which the organization competes.&lt;ref name="Nag, R.; Hambrick, D. C.; Chen, M.-J 2007 935–955"/&gt; [[Strategy]] is defined as "the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals."&lt;ref name="Chandler, Alfred 1962"&gt;Chandler, Alfred ''Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the history of industrial enterprise'', Doubleday, New York, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strategies are established to set direction, focus effort, define or clarify the organization, and provide consistency or guidance in response to the environment.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg, Henry 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[California Management Review]] |year=1987 |issue=Fall 1987 |title= Why Organizations Need Strategy |author= Mintzberg, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic management involves the related concepts of [[strategic planning]] and [[strategic thinking]]&lt;ref&gt;Graetz, F., 2002. Strategic thinking versus strategic planning: towards understanding the complementarities. Management decision, 40(5), pp.456-462.&lt;/ref&gt;. Strategic planning is analytical in nature and refers to formalized procedures to produce the data and analyses used as inputs for strategic thinking, which synthesizes the data resulting in the strategy. [[Strategic planning]] may also refer to control mechanisms used to implement the strategy once it is determined. In other words, strategic planning happens ''around'' the strategic thinking or strategy making activity.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

Strategic management is often described as involving two major processes: ''formulation'' and ''implementation'' of strategy. While described sequentially below, in practice the two processes are iterative and each provides input for the other.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"&gt;{{cite book

| first = Quinn, James Brian
| year = 1996
| title = [[The Strategy Process:Concepts, Contexts, Cases]] | publisher = Prentice Hall
| isbn = 978-0-13-234030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation===
''Formulation'' of strategy involves analyzing the environment in which the organization operates, then making a series of strategic decisions about how the organization will compete. Formulation ends with a series of goals or objectives and measures for the organization to pursue.  
Environmental analysis includes the:
*Remote external environment, including the political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental landscape ([[PEST analysis|PESTLE]]);
*Industry environment, such as the competitive behavior of rival organizations, the bargaining power of buyers/customers and suppliers, threats from new entrants to the industry, and the ability of buyers to substitute products ([[Porter five forces analysis|Porter's 5 forces]]); and 
*Internal environment, regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the organization's resources (i.e., its people, processes and IT systems).&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

''Strategic decisions'' are based on insight from the environmental assessment and are responses to strategic questions about how the organization will compete, such as:
*What is the organization's business?
*Who is the target customer for the organization's products and services? 
*Where are the customers and how do they buy? What is considered "value" to the customer?
*Which businesses, products and services should be included or excluded from the portfolio of offerings?
*What is the geographic scope of the business?
*What differentiates the company from its competitors in the eyes of customers and other stakeholders?
*Which skills and capabilities should be developed within the firm?
*What are the important opportunities and risks for the organization?
*How can the firm grow, through both its base business and new business?
*How can the firm generate more [[Shareholder value|value]] for investors?&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drucker1954"&gt;{{cite book

| first = Peter
| authorlink = Peter Drucker
| year = 1954
| title = [[The Practice of Management]] | publisher = Harper &amp; Row
| isbn = 0-06-091316-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The answers to these and many other strategic questions result in the organization's strategy and a series of specific short-term and long-term goals or objectives and related measures.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

===Implementation===
The second major process of strategic management is ''implementation'', which involves decisions regarding how the organization's resources (i.e., people, process and IT systems) will be aligned and mobilized towards the objectives.  Implementation results in how the organization's resources are structured (such as by product or service or geography), leadership arrangements, communication, incentives, and monitoring mechanisms to track progress towards objectives, among others.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

Running the day-to-day operations of the business is often referred to as "operations management" or specific terms for key departments or functions, such as "logistics management" or "marketing management," which take over once strategic management decisions are implemented.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

In 1988, [[Henry Mintzberg]] described the many different definitions and perspectives on strategy reflected in both academic research and in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, Henry “Crafting Strategy”, Harvard Business Review, July/August 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, Henry and Quinn, J.B. ''The Strategy Process'', Prentice-Hall, Harlow, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; He examined the strategic process and concluded it was much more fluid and unpredictable than people had thought. Because of this, he could not point to one process that could be called [[strategic planning]]. Instead Mintzberg concludes that there are five types of strategies:
* Strategy as plan – a directed course of action to achieve an ''intended'' set of goals; similar to the strategic planning concept;
* Strategy as pattern – a consistent pattern of past behavior, with a strategy ''realized'' over time rather than planned or ''intended''. Where the realized pattern was different from the intent, he referred to the strategy as ''emergent'';
* Strategy as position – locating brands, products, or companies within the market, based on the conceptual framework of consumers or other stakeholders; a strategy determined primarily by factors outside the firm;
* Strategy as ploy – a specific maneuver intended to outwit a competitor; and
* Strategy as perspective – executing strategy based on a "theory of the business" or natural extension of the mindset or ideological perspective of the organization.

In 1998, Mintzberg developed these five types of management strategy into 10 “schools of thought” and grouped them into three categories. The first group is normative. It consists of the schools of informal design and conception, the formal planning, and analytical positioning. The second group, consisting of six schools, is more concerned with how strategic management is actually done, rather than prescribing optimal plans or positions. The six schools are entrepreneurial, visionary, cognitive, learning/adaptive/emergent, negotiation, corporate culture and business environment. The third and final group consists of one school, the configuration or transformation school, a hybrid of the other schools organized into stages, organizational life cycles, or “episodes”.&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, H. Ahlstrand, B. and Lampel, J. ''Strategy Safari : A Guided Tour Through the Wilds of Strategic Management'', The Free Press, New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Porter]] defined strategy in 1980 as the "...broad formula for how a business is going to compete, what its goals should be, and what policies will be needed to carry out those goals" and the "...combination of the ''ends'' (goals) for which the firm is striving and the ''means'' (policies) by which it is seeking to get there." He continued that: "The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a company to its environment."&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;

Some complexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a socio-economic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=R.

==Historical development==

===Origins===
The strategic management discipline originated in the 1950s and 1960s. Among the numerous early contributors, the most influential were Peter Drucker, Philip Selznick, Alfred Chandler, Igor Ansoff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.francoangeli.it/ricerca/Scheda_libro.aspx?ID=2297&amp;Tipo=Libro|title=Strategia sì, ma non troppo.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline draws from earlier thinking and texts on '[[strategy]]' dating back thousands of years. Prior to 1960, the term "strategy" was primarily used regarding war and politics, not business.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt; Many companies built [[strategic planning]] functions to develop and execute the formulation and implementation processes during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1994/01/the-fall-and-rise-of-strategic-planning/ar/1 Henry Mintberg-The Fall and Rise of Strategic Planning-Harvard Business Review-January 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Drucker]] was a prolific management theorist and author of dozens of management books, with a career spanning five decades. He addressed fundamental strategic questions in a 1954 book ''The Practice of Management'' writing: "... the first responsibility of top management is to ask the question 'what is our business?' and to make sure it is carefully studied and correctly answered." He wrote that the answer was determined by the customer. He recommended eight areas where objectives should be set, such as market standing, innovation, productivity, physical and financial resources, worker performance and attitude, profitability, manager performance and development, and public responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter ''The Practice of Management'', Harper and Row, New York, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, [[Philip Selznick]] initially used the term "distinctive competence" in referring to how the Navy was attempting to differentiate itself from the other services.&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"/&gt; He also formalized the idea of matching the organization's internal factors with external environmental circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Selznick, Philip ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pP6ndnDdOBcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Leadership in Administration: A Sociological Interpretation]'', Row, Peterson, Evanston Il. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; This core idea was developed further by [[Kenneth R. Andrews]] in 1963 into what we now call [[SWOT analysis]], in which the strengths and weaknesses of the firm are assessed in light of the opportunities and threats in the business environment.&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"/&gt;

[[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]] recognized the importance of coordinating management activity under an all-encompassing strategy. Interactions between functions were typically handled by managers who relayed information back and forth between departments. Chandler stressed the importance of taking a long term perspective when looking to the future. In his 1962 ground breaking work ''Strategy and Structure'', Chandler showed that a long-term coordinated strategy was necessary to give a company structure, direction and focus. He says it concisely, "[[structure follows strategy]]." Chandler wrote that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''Strategy is the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals''."&lt;ref name="Chandler, Alfred 1962"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Igor Ansoff]] built on Chandler's work by adding concepts and inventing a vocabulary. He developed a grid that compared strategies for market penetration, product development, market development and [[horizontal integration|horizontal]] and [[vertical integration]] and diversification. He felt that management could use the grid to systematically prepare for the future. In his 1965 classic ''Corporate Strategy'', he developed [[gap analysis]] to clarify the gap between the current reality and the goals and to develop what he called "gap reducing actions".&lt;ref&gt;Ansoff, Igor ''Corporate Strategy'', McGraw Hill, New York, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Ansoff wrote that strategic management had three parts: [[strategic planning]]; the skill of a firm in converting its plans into reality; and the skill of a firm in managing its own internal resistance to change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/13311148 The Economist-Strategic Planning-March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Henderson]], founder of the [[Boston Consulting Group]], wrote about the concept of the [[experience curve]] in 1968, following initial work begun in 1965. The experience curve refers to a hypothesis that unit production costs decline by 20–30% every time cumulative production doubles. This supported the argument for achieving higher market share and [[economies of scale]].&lt;ref name="BCG1968"&gt;{{cite book

Porter wrote in 1980 that companies have to make choices about their scope and the type of competitive advantage they seek to achieve, whether lower cost or differentiation. The idea of strategy targeting particular industries and customers (i.e., competitive positions) with a differentiated offering was a departure from the experience-curve influenced strategy paradigm, which was focused on larger scale and lower cost.&lt;ref name="Porter1980"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Porter
| first = Michael E.
| year = 1980
| title = [[Competitive Strategy]] | publisher = Free Press
| isbn = 0-684-84148-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porter revised the strategy paradigm again in 1985, writing that superior performance of the processes and activities performed by organizations as part of their [[value chain]] is the foundation of competitive advantage, thereby outlining a process view of strategy.&lt;ref name="Porter1985"/&gt;

===Change in focus from production to marketing===
The direction of strategic research also paralleled a major paradigm shift in how companies competed, specifically a shift from the production focus to market focus.  The prevailing concept in strategy up to the 1950s was to create a [[product (business)|product]] of high technical quality. If you created a product that worked well and was durable, it was assumed you would have no difficulty profiting. This was called the [[production orientation]]. [[Henry Ford]] famously said of the Model T car: "Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants, so long as it is black."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Henry Ford|Wikiquote-Henry Ford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Management theorist [[Peter F Drucker]] wrote in 1954 that it was the customer who defined what business the organization was in.&lt;ref name="Drucker1954"/&gt; In 1960 [[Theodore Levitt]] argued that instead of producing products then trying to sell them to the customer, businesses should start with the customer, find out what they wanted, and then produce it for them. The fallacy of the production orientation was also referred to as [[marketing myopia]] in an article of the same name by Levitt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/2004/07/marketing-myopia/ar/1 Theodore Levitt-Marketing Myopia-HBR-1960]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the customer became the driving force behind all strategic business decisions. This [[marketing]] concept, in the decades since its introduction, has been reformulated and repackaged under names including market orientation, customer orientation, customer intimacy, customer focus, customer-driven and market focus.

[[James C. Collins|Jim Collins]] wrote in 1997 that the strategic frame of reference is expanded by focusing on ''why'' a company exists rather than ''what'' it makes.&lt;ref name="jimcollins.com"/&gt; In 2001, he recommended that organizations define themselves based on three key questions:
*What are we passionate about?
*What can we be best in the world at?
*What drives our economic engine?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html Jim Collins-Good to Great-Fast Company Magazine-October 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature of strategy===
In 1985, Professor Ellen Earle-Chaffee summarized what she thought were the main elements of strategic management theory where consensus generally existed as of the 1970s, writing that strategic management:&lt;ref name="Chaffee, E. 1985"/&gt;
* Involves adapting the organization to its business environment;
* Is fluid and complex. Change creates novel combinations of circumstances requiring unstructured non-repetitive responses;
* Affects the entire organization by providing direction;
* Involves both strategy formulation processes and also implementation of the content of the strategy;
* May be planned (intended) and unplanned (emergent);
* Is done at several levels: overall corporate strategy, and individual business strategies; and
* Involves both conceptual and analytical thought processes.

Chaffee further wrote that research up to that point covered three models of strategy, which were not mutually exclusive: 
#Linear strategy: A planned determination of goals, initiatives, and allocation of resources, along the lines of the Chandler definition above. This is most consistent with [[strategic planning]] approaches and may have a long planning horizon. The strategist "deals with" the environment but it is not the central concern.
#Adaptive strategy: In this model, the organization's goals and activities are primarily concerned with adaptation to the environment, analogous to a biological organism. The need for continuous adaption reduces or eliminates the planning window. There is more focus on means (resource mobilization to address the environment) rather than ends (goals). Strategy is less centralized than in the linear model.
#Interpretive strategy: A more recent and less developed model than the linear and adaptive models, interpretive strategy is concerned with "orienting metaphors constructed for the purpose of conceptualizing and guiding individual attitudes or organizational participants." The aim of interpretive strategy is legitimacy or credibility in the mind of stakeholders. It places emphasis on symbols and language to influence the minds of customers, rather than the physical product of the organization.&lt;ref name="Chaffee, E. 1985"/&gt;

==Concepts and frameworks==
The progress of strategy since 1960 can be charted by a variety of frameworks and concepts introduced by management consultants and academics. These reflect an increased focus on cost, competition and customers. These "3 Cs" were illuminated by much more robust empirical analysis at ever-more granular levels of detail, as industries and organizations were disaggregated into business units, activities, processes, and individuals in a search for sources of competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt;

===SWOT analysis===
{{Main article|SWOT analysis}}
[[File:SWOT en.svg|thumb|A SWOT analysis, with its four elements in a 2×2 matrix.]]
By the 1960s, the capstone business policy course at the Harvard Business School included the concept of matching the distinctive competence of a company (its internal strengths and weaknesses) with its environment (external opportunities and threats) in the context of its objectives. This framework came to be known by the acronym SWOT and was "a major step forward in bringing explicitly competitive thinking to bear on questions of strategy". [[Kenneth R. Andrews]] helped popularize the framework via a 1963 conference and it remains commonly used in practice.&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"/&gt;

===Experience curve===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Experience curve.gif|300px|thumb|Experience curve]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Experience curve}}
The [[experience curve]] was developed by the [[Boston Consulting Group]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Kiechel
| first = Walter
| year = 2010
| title = [[The Lords of Strategy]] | publisher = Harvard Business Press
| isbn = 978-1-59139-782-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a hypothesis that total per unit costs decline systematically by as much as 15–25% every time cumulative production (i.e., "experience") doubles. It has been empirically confirmed by some firms at various points in their history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/Classics/strategy_supply_chain_management_experience_curve_reviewed_the_concept/ BCG Perspectives-The Experience Curve Reviewed-Parts 1-5-1974]&lt;/ref&gt; Costs decline due to a variety of factors, such as the [[learning curve]], substitution of labor for capital (automation), and technological sophistication. Author [[Walter Kiechel]] wrote that it reflected several insights, including:
*A company can always improve its cost structure;
*Competitors have varying cost positions based on their experience;
*Firms could achieve lower costs through higher market share, attaining a competitive advantage; and
*An increased focus on empirical analysis of costs and processes, a concept which author Kiechel refers to as "Greater [[Scientific management|Taylorism]]".
Kiechel wrote in 2010: "The experience curve was, simply, the most important concept in launching the strategy revolution...with the experience curve, the strategy revolution began to insinuate an acute awareness of competition into the corporate consciousness." Prior to the 1960s, the word competition rarely appeared in the most prominent management literature; U.S. companies then faced considerably less competition and did not focus on performance relative to peers. Further, the experience curve provided a basis for the retail sale of business ideas, helping drive the management consulting 
industry.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt;

===Corporate strategy and portfolio theory===
{{Main article|Modern portfolio theory|Growth–share matrix}}
[[Image:Folio Plot BCG Matrix Example.png|BCG Matrix|right|thumb|Portfolio growth–share matrix]]

The concept of the corporation as a portfolio of business units, with each plotted graphically based on its market share (a measure of its competitive position relative to its peers) and industry growth rate (a measure of industry attractiveness), was summarized in the [[growth–share matrix]] developed by the Boston Consulting Group around 1970. By 1979, one study estimated that 45% of the Fortune 500 companies were using some variation of the matrix in their strategic planning. This framework helped companies decide where to invest their resources (i.e., in their high market share, high growth businesses) and which businesses to divest (i.e., low market share, low growth businesses.)&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt; [[C. K. Prahalad]] and [[Gary Hamel]] suggested that companies should build portfolios of businesses around shared technical or operating competencies, and should develop structures and processes to enhance their [[Core_competency|core competencies]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/1995/03/corporate-strategy-the-quest-for-parenting-advantage Corporate Strategy: The Quest for Parenting Advantage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter wrote in 1987 that corporate strategy involves two questions: 1) What business should the corporation be in? and 2) How should the corporate office manage its business units? He mentioned four concepts of corporate strategy; the latter three can be used together:&lt;ref name="Porter1987"&gt;[http://people.tamu.edu/~v-buenger/466/Comp_Adv_to_corp_strat.pdf Harvard Business Review-Michael Porter-From Competitive Advantage to Corporate Strategy-May 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;
#Portfolio theory: A strategy based primarily on diversification through acquisition. The corporation shifts resources among the units and monitors the performance of each business unit and its leaders. Each unit generally runs autonomously, with limited interference from the corporate center provided goals are met. 
#Restructuring: The corporate office acquires then actively intervenes in a business where it detects potential, often by replacing management and implementing a new business strategy.
#Transferring skills: Important managerial skills and organizational capability are essentially spread to multiple businesses. The skills must be necessary to competitive advantage.
#Sharing activities: Ability of the combined corporation to leverage centralized functions, such as sales, finance, etc. thereby reducing costs.&lt;ref name="Porter1987"/&gt;

Other techniques were developed to analyze the relationships between elements in a portfolio. The growth-share matrix, a part of [[B.C.G. Analysis]], was followed by [[G.E. multi factoral analysis|G.E. multi factoral model]], developed by General Electric. Companies continued to diversify as conglomerates until the 1980s, when deregulation and a less restrictive anti-trust environment led to the view that a portfolio of operating divisions in different industries was worth more as many independent companies, leading to the breakup of many conglomerates.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt;  While the popularity of portfolio theory has waxed and waned, the key dimensions considered (industry attractiveness and competitive position) remain central to strategy.&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"/&gt;

===Competitive advantage===
{{Main article|Competitive advantage}}
In 1980, Porter defined the two types of competitive advantage an organization can achieve relative to its rivals: lower cost or [[Product differentiation|differentiation]]. This advantage derives from attribute(s) that allow an organization to outperform its competition, such as superior market position, skills, or resources. In Porter's view, strategic management should be concerned with building and sustaining competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="Porter1985"&gt;{{cite book

===Industry structure and profitability===
[[File:Elements of Industry Structure.svg|thumb|350px|A graphical representation of Porter's Five Forces]]
{{Main article|Porter five forces analysis}}
Porter developed a framework for analyzing the profitability of industries and how those profits are divided among the participants in 1980. In [[Porter 5 forces analysis|five forces analysis]] he identified the forces that shape the industry structure or environment. The framework involves the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, the threat of new entrants, the availability of substitute products, and the competitive rivalry of firms in the industry. These forces affect the organization's ability to raise its prices as well as the costs of inputs (such as raw materials) for its processes.&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;

The five forces framework helps describe how a firm can use these forces to obtain a [[sustainable competitive advantage]], either lower cost or differentiation. Companies can maximize their profitability by competing in industries with favorable structure. Competitors can take steps to grow the overall profitability of the industry, or to take profit away from other parts of the industry structure. Porter modified Chandler's dictum about structure following strategy by introducing a second level of structure: while organizational structure follows strategy, it in turn follows industry structure.&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;

===Generic competitive strategies===
{{Main article|Porter's generic strategies}}
[[Image:Michael Porter's Three Generic Strategies.svg|thumb|left|350px|Michael Porter's Three Generic Strategies]]
Porter wrote in 1980 that strategy target either [[cost leadership]], [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]], or focus.&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt; These are known as Porter's three generic strategies and can be applied to any size or form of business. Porter claimed that a company must only choose one of the three or risk that the business would waste precious resources. Porter's [[Porter generic strategies|generic strategies]] detail the interaction between cost minimization strategies, product differentiation strategies, and market focus strategies.

Porter described an industry as having multiple ''segments'' that can be targeted by a firm. The breadth of its targeting refers to the ''competitive scope'' of the business.  Porter defined two types of ''competitive advantage'': lower cost or differentiation relative to its rivals. Achieving competitive advantage results from a firm's ability to cope with the five forces better than its rivals. Porter wrote: "[A]chieving competitive advantage requires a firm to make a choice...about the type of competitive advantage it seeks to attain and the scope within which it will attain it." He also wrote: "The two basic types of competitive advantage [differentiation and lower cost] combined with the scope of activities for which a firm seeks to achieve them lead to three ''generic strategies'' for achieving above average performance in an industry: cost leadership, differentiation and focus. The focus strategy has two variants, cost focus and differentiation focus."&lt;ref name="Porter1985"/&gt;

The concept of choice was a different perspective on strategy, as the 1970s [[paradigm]] was the pursuit of market share (size and scale) influenced by the [[experience curve]]. Companies that pursued the highest market share position to achieve cost advantages fit under Porter's cost leadership generic strategy, but the concept of choice regarding differentiation and focus represented a new perspective.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt;

===Value chain===
[[File:Porter Value Chain.png|thumb|350px|right|Michael Porter's Value Chain]]
{{Main article|Value chain}}
Porter's 1985 description of the [[value chain]] refers to the chain of activities (processes or collections of processes) that an organization performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service for the market. These include functions such as inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service, supported by systems and technology infrastructure. By aligning the various activities in its value chain with the organization's strategy in a coherent way, a firm can achieve a competitive advantage. Porter also wrote that strategy is an internally consistent configuration of activities that differentiates a firm from its rivals. A robust competitive position cumulates from many activities which should fit coherently together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1996/11/what-is-strategy/ar/1 Michael Porter-What is Strategy?-Harvard Business Review-November 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter wrote in 1985: "Competitive advantage cannot be understood by looking at a firm as a whole. It stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing, producing, marketing, delivering and supporting its product. Each of these activities can contribute to a firm's relative cost position and create a basis for differentiation...the value chain disaggregates a firm into its strategically relevant activities in order to understand the behavior of costs and the existing and potential sources of differentiation."&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"/&gt;

===Core competence===
{{Main article|Core competency}}
[[Gary Hamel]] and [[C. K. Prahalad]] described the idea of [[core competency]] in 1990, the idea that each organization has some capability in which it excels and that the business should focus on opportunities in that area, letting others go or [[outsourcing]] them. Further, core competency is difficult to duplicate, as it involves the skills and coordination of people across a variety of functional areas or processes used to deliver value to customers. By outsourcing, companies expanded the concept of the value chain, with some elements within the entity and others without.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, G. &amp; Prahalad, C.K. “The Core Competence of the Corporation”, ''Harvard Business Review'', May–June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Core competency is part of a branch of strategy called the ''[[resource-based view]]'' of the firm, which postulates that if activities are strategic as indicated by the value chain, then the organization's capabilities and ability to learn or adapt are also strategic.&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"/&gt;

===Theory of the business===
[[Peter Drucker]] wrote in 1994 about the "Theory of the Business," which represents the key assumptions underlying a firm's strategy.  These assumptions are in three categories: a) the external environment, including society, market, customer, and technology; b) the mission of the organization; and c) the core competencies needed to accomplish the mission. He continued that a valid theory of the business has four specifications: 1) assumptions about the environment, mission, and core competencies must fit reality; 2) the assumptions in all three areas have to fit one another; 3) the theory of the business must be known and understood throughout the organization; and 4) the theory of the business has to be tested constantly.

He wrote that organizations get into trouble when the assumptions representing the theory of the business no longer fit reality.  He used an example of retail department stores, where their theory of the business assumed that people who could afford to shop in department stores would do so. However, many shoppers abandoned department stores in favor of specialty retailers (often located outside of malls) when time became the primary factor in the shopping destination rather than income.

Drucker described the theory of the business as a "hypothesis" and a "discipline." He advocated building in systematic diagnostics, monitoring and testing of the assumptions comprising the theory of the business to maintain competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Harvard Business Review]] |year=1994 |issue=September–October 1994 |title=The Theory of the Business |author=Drucker, Peter F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic thinking==
{{Main article|Strategic thinking}}

[[Strategic thinking]] involves the generation and application of unique business insights to opportunities intended to create competitive advantage for a firm or organization. It involves challenging the assumptions underlying the organization's strategy and value proposition. Mintzberg wrote in 1994 that it is more about synthesis (i.e., "connecting the dots") than analysis (i.e., "finding the dots"). It is about "capturing what the manager learns from all sources (both the soft insights from his or her personal experiences and the experiences of others throughout the organization and the hard data from market research and the like) and then synthesizing that learning into a vision of the direction that the business should pursue." Mintzberg argued that strategic thinking is the critical part of formulating strategy, more so than strategic planning exercises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1994/01/the-fall-and-rise-of-strategic-planning/ar/1 Henry Mintzberg-The Fall and Rise of Strategic Planning-Harvard Business Review-January 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Andre Beaufre]] wrote in 1963 that strategic thinking "is a mental process, at once abstract and rational, which must be capable of synthesizing both psychological and material data.  The strategist must have a great capacity for both analysis and synthesis; analysis is necessary to assemble the data on which he makes his diagnosis, synthesis in order to produce from these data the diagnosis itself--and the diagnosis in fact amounts to a choice between alternative courses of action."&lt;ref name="Beaufre1965"&gt;{{cite book

Will Mulcaster&lt;ref&gt;Mulcaster, W.R. "Three Strategic Frameworks," Business Strategy Series, Vol 10, No1, pp68 – 75, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that while much research and creative thought has been devoted to generating alternative strategies, too little work has been done on what influences the quality of strategic decision making and the effectiveness with which strategies are implemented. For instance, in retrospect it can be seen that the financial crisis of 2008–9 could have been avoided if the banks had paid more attention to the risks associated with their investments, but how should banks change the way they make decisions to improve the quality of their decisions in the future? Mulcaster's Managing Forces framework addresses this issue by identifying 11 forces that should be incorporated into the processes of decision making and strategic implementation. The 11 forces are: Time; Opposing forces; Politics; Perception; Holistic effects; Adding value; Incentives; Learning capabilities; Opportunity cost; Risk and Style.

==Strategic planning==
{{Main article|Strategic planning}}
Strategic planning is a means of administering the formulation and implementation of strategy. Strategic planning is analytical in nature and refers to formalized procedures to produce the data and analyses used as inputs for strategic thinking, which synthesizes the data resulting in the strategy. Strategic planning may also refer to control mechanisms used to implement the strategy once it is determined. In other words, strategic planning happens ''around'' the strategy formation process.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

===Environmental analysis===
Porter wrote in 1980 that formulation of competitive strategy includes consideration of four key elements:
#Company strengths and weaknesses;
#Personal values of the key implementers (i.e., management and the board)
#Industry opportunities and threats; and
#Broader societal expectations.&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;
The first two elements relate to factors internal to the company (i.e., the internal environment), while the latter two relate to factors external to the company (i.e., the external environment).&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;

There are many analytical frameworks which attempt to organize the strategic planning process. Examples of frameworks that address the four elements described above include:
*External environment: [[PEST analysis]] or [[STEEP analysis]] is a framework used to examine the remote external environmental factors that can affect the organization, such as political, economic, social/demographic, and technological. Common variations include SLEPT, PESTLE, STEEPLE, and STEER analysis, each of which incorporates slightly different emphases.
*Industry environment: The [[Porter five forces analysis|Porter Five Forces Analysis]] framework helps to determine the competitive rivalry and therefore attractiveness of a market. It is used to help determine the portfolio of offerings the organization will provide and in which markets.
*Relationship of internal and external environment: [[SWOT analysis]] is one of the most basic and widely used frameworks, which examines both internal elements of the organization—'''S'''trengths and '''W'''eaknesses—and external elements—'''O'''pportunities and '''T'''hreats. It helps examine the organization's resources in the context of its environment.

===Scenario planning===
A number of strategists use [[scenario planning]] techniques to deal with change. The way [[Peter Schwartz (futurist)|Peter Schwartz]] put it in 1991 is that strategic outcomes cannot be known in advance so the sources of competitive advantage cannot be predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;Scwhartz, Peter ''The Art of the Long View'', Doubleday, New York, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The fast changing business environment is too uncertain for us to find sustainable value in formulas of excellence or competitive advantage. Instead, scenario planning is a technique in which multiple outcomes can be developed, their implications assessed, and their likeliness of occurrence evaluated. According to [[Pierre Wack]], scenario planning is about insight, complexity, and subtlety, not about formal analysis and numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Wack, Pierre “Scenarios: Uncharted Waters Ahead”, ''Harvard Business review'', September October 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some business planners are starting to use a [[complexity theory approach to strategy]]. Complexity can be thought of as chaos with a dash of order.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.strategy-business.com/article/15099?gko=73fbc Between Chaos and Order: What Complexity Theory Can Teach Business]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaos theory]] deals with turbulent systems that rapidly become disordered. Complexity is not quite so unpredictable. It involves multiple agents interacting in such a way that a glimpse of structure may appear.

===Measuring and controlling implementation===
[[File:Generic Strategy Map.png|thumb|Generic Strategy Map illustrating four elements of a balanced scorecard]]
Once the strategy is determined, various goals and measures may be established to chart a course for the organization, measure performance and control implementation of the strategy. Tools such as the [[balanced scorecard]] and [[strategy maps]] help crystallize the strategy, by relating key measures of success and performance to the strategy. These tools measure [[financial]], [[marketing]], [[manufacturing|production]], [[organizational development]], and [[new product development|innovation]] measures to achieve a 'balanced' perspective.  Advances in information technology and data availability enable the gathering of more information about performance, allowing managers to take a much more analytical view of their business than before.

Strategy may also be organized as a series of "initiatives" or "programs", each of which comprises one or more projects. Various monitoring and feedback mechanisms may also be established, such as regular meetings between divisional and corporate management to control implementation.

===Evaluation===

A key component to strategic management which is often overlooked when planning is evaluation. There are many ways to evaluate whether or not strategic priorities and plans have been achieved, one such method is [[Robert E. Stake|Robert Stake]]'s Responsive Evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Bobby Thomas. [https://slr.scholasticahq.com/article/426-using-responsive-evaluation-in-strategic-management Using responsive evaluation in strategic management]. Strategic Leadership Review 4 (2), 22-27&lt;/ref&gt;  [https://submissions.scholasticahq.com/supporting_files/248937/attachment_versions/249177 Responsive evaluation] provides a naturalistic and humanistic approach to program evaluation. In expanding beyond the goal-oriented or pre-ordinate evaluation design, responsive evaluation takes into consideration the program’s background (history), conditions, and transactions among stakeholders. It is largely emergent, the design unfolds as contact is made with stakeholders.

==Limitations==
While strategies are established to set direction, focus effort, define or clarify the organization, and provide consistency or guidance in response to the environment, these very elements also mean that certain signals are excluded from consideration or de-emphasized. Mintzberg wrote in 1987: "Strategy is a categorizing scheme by which incoming stimuli can be ordered and dispatched." Since a strategy orients the organization in a particular manner or direction, that direction may not effectively match the environment, initially (if a bad strategy) or over time as circumstances change. As such, Mintzberg continued, "Strategy [once established] is a force that resists change, not encourages it."&lt;ref name="Mintzberg, Henry 1987"/&gt;

Therefore, a critique of strategic management is that it can overly constrain managerial discretion in a dynamic environment. "How can individuals, organizations and societies cope as well as possible with ... issues too complex to be fully understood, given the fact that actions initiated on the basis of inadequate understanding may lead to significant regret?"&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward J. and David Collingridge, "Incrementalism, Intelligent Trial-and-Error, and the Future of Political Decision Theory," in Redner, Harry, ed., ''An Heretical Heir of the Enlightenment: Politics, Policy and Science in the Work of Charles E. Limdblom'', Boulder, C.: Westview Press, 1993, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;  Some theorists insist on an iterative approach, considering in turn objectives, implementation and resources.&lt;ref name=dwm&gt;de Wit and Meyer, Strategy Process, Content and Context, Thomson Learning 2008&lt;/ref&gt; I.e., a "...repetitive learning cycle [rather than] a linear progression towards a clearly defined final destination."&lt;ref&gt;Elcock, Howard, "Strategic Management," in Farnham, D. and S. Horton (eds.), ''Managing the New Public Services'', 2nd Edition, New York: Macmillan, 1996, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies must be able to adjust during implementation because "humans rarely can proceed satisfactorily except by learning from experience; and modest probes, serially modified on the basis of feedback, usually are the best method for such learning."&lt;ref name=wc&gt;Woodhouse and Collingridge, 1993. p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Gary Hamel coined the term '''strategic convergence''' to explain the limited scope of the strategies being used by rivals in greatly differing circumstances. He lamented that successful strategies are imitated by firms that do not understand that for a strategy to work, it must account for the specifics of each situation.&lt;ref name="Hamel, Gary 2002"/&gt;
Woodhouse and Collingridge claim that the essence of being “strategic” lies in a capacity for "intelligent trial-and error"&lt;ref name=wc/&gt; rather than strict adherence to finely honed strategic plans. Strategy should be seen as laying out the general path rather than precise steps.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Mark H., ''Creating Public Value: Strategic Management in Government'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Means are as likely to determine ends as ends are to determine means.&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom, Charles E., "The Science of Muddling Through," ''Public Administration Review'', Vol. 19 (1959), No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  The objectives that an organization might wish to pursue are limited by the range of feasible approaches to implementation. (There will usually be only a small number of approaches that will not only be technically and administratively possible, but also satisfactory to the full range of organizational stakeholders.) In turn, the range of feasible implementation approaches is determined by the availability of resources.

==Strategic themes==
Various strategic approaches used across industries (themes) have arisen over the years.  These include the shift from product-driven demand to customer- or marketing-driven demand (described above), the increased use of self-service approaches to lower cost, changes in the value chain or corporate structure due to globalization (e.g., off-shoring of production and assembly), and the internet.

===Self-service===
One theme in strategic competition has been the trend towards self-service, often enabled by technology, where the customer takes on a role previously performed by a worker to lower the price.&lt;ref name="Porter, Michael E. 1996"/&gt; Examples include:
*[[Automated teller machine]] (ATM) to obtain cash rather via a bank teller;
*Self-service at the gas pump rather than with help from an attendant;
*Retail internet orders input by the customer rather than a retail clerk, such as online book sales;
*Mass-produced ready-to-assemble furniture transported by the customer; 
*Self-checkout at the grocery store; and
*Online banking and bill payment.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary. (2015). In ''Investopedia''. Retrieved from http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onlinebanking.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization and the virtual firm===
One definition of [[globalization]] refers to the integration of economies due to technology and [[supply chain]] process innovation. Companies are no longer required to be vertically integrated (i.e., designing, producing, assembling, and selling their products). In other words, the value chain for a company's product may no longer be entirely within one firm; several entities comprising a virtual firm may exist to fulfill the customer requirement.  For example, some companies have chosen to [[outsource]] production to third parties, retaining only design and sales functions inside their organization.&lt;ref name="Porter, Michael E. 1996"/&gt;

===Internet and information availability===
{{See also|Internet of things}}
The internet has dramatically empowered consumers and enabled buyers and sellers to come together with drastically reduced transaction and intermediary costs, creating much more robust marketplaces for the purchase and sale of goods and services. Examples include online auction sites, internet dating services, and internet book sellers. In many industries, the internet has dramatically altered the competitive landscape. Services that used to be provided within one entity (e.g., a car dealership providing financing and pricing information) are now provided by third parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatonprogram.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Strategy-and-the-Internet.pdf Michael Porter-Strategy and the Internet-Harvard Business Review-March 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325053521/http://www.eatonprogram.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Strategy-and-the-Internet.pdf |date=2014-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, compared to traditional media like television, the internet has caused a major shift in viewing habits through on demand content which has led to an increasingly fragmented audience.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Author Phillip Evans said in 2013 that networks are challenging traditional hierarchies. Value chains may also be breaking up ("deconstructing") where information aspects can be separated from functional activity. Data that is readily available for free or very low cost makes it harder for information-based, vertically integrated businesses to remain intact. Evans said: "The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving, by one means or another, from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening? It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together, and allows them to separate."  He used Wikipedia as an example of a network that has challenged the traditional encyclopedia business model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ted.com/talks/philip_evans_how_data_will_transform_business Phillip Evans-How Data will Transform Business-November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Evans predicts the emergence of a new form of industrial organization called a "stack", analogous to a [[technology stack]], in which competitors rely on a common platform of inputs (services or information), essentially layering the remaining competing parts of their value chains on top of this common platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/interviews/future_strategy_business_unit_strategy_philip_evans_rethinking_strategy_age_digital_disruption/ BCG-Phillip Evans-Rethinking Strategy for an Age of Digital Disruption-March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Sustainability]]===
In the recent decade, sustainability—or ability to successfully sustain a company in a context of rapidly changing environmental, social, health, and economic circumstances—has emerged as crucial aspect of any strategy development. Research focusing on corporations and leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has led to emergence of the concept of "embedded sustainability" – defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and [[Nadya Zhexembayeva]] as "incorporation of environmental, health, and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality—in other words, with no social or green premium."&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, Chris and Zhexembayeva, Nadya (April 25, 2011) [http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=2927 "Embedded Sustainability: A strategy for market leaders"]. ''The European Financial Review''&lt;/ref&gt; Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value and competitive advantage creation: a) better risk-management, b) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use, c) better product differentiation, d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, C. &amp; Zhexembayeva, N. (2011). ''Embedded Sustainability: The Next Big Competitive Advantage''. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-804-77554-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nadya Zhexembayeva]]'s 2014 research further suggested that innovation driven by resource depletion can result in fundamental competitive advantages for a company's products and services, as well as the company strategy as a whole, when right principles of innovation are applied.&lt;ref&gt;Zhexembayeva, N. (2014). ''Overfished Ocean Strategy: Powering Up Innovation for a Resource-Depleted World''. San Francisco, CA: Berret-Koehler Publishers. {{ISBN|1 609-94964-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy as learning==
{{See also|Organizational learning}}
In 1990, [[Peter Senge]], who had collaborated with [[Arie de Geus]] at Dutch Shell, popularized de Geus' notion of the "learning organization".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1997/03/the-living-company/ar/ Arie de Geus-The Learning Company-HBR-March 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that gathering and analyzing information is a necessary requirement for business success in the information age. To do this, Senge claimed that an organization would need to be structured such that:&lt;ref&gt;Senge, Peter. ''The Fifth Discipline'', Doubleday, New York, 1990; (also Century, London, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

* People can continuously expand their capacity to learn and be productive.
* New patterns of thinking are nurtured.
* Collective aspirations are encouraged.
* People are encouraged to see the "whole picture" together.

Senge identified five disciplines of a learning organization. They are:

* Personal responsibility, self-reliance, and mastery – We accept that we are the masters of our own destiny. We make decisions and live with the consequences of them. When a problem needs to be fixed, or an opportunity exploited, we take the initiative to learn the required skills to get it done.
* Mental models – We need to explore our personal mental models to understand the subtle effect they have on our behaviour.
* Shared vision – The vision of where we want to be in the future is discussed and communicated to all. It provides guidance and energy for the journey ahead.
* Team learning – We learn together in teams. This involves a shift from "a spirit of advocacy to a spirit of enquiry".
* [[Systems thinking]] – We look at the whole rather than the parts. This is what Senge calls the "Fifth discipline". It is the glue that integrates the other four into a coherent strategy. For an alternative approach to the "learning organization", see Garratt, B. (1987).

[[Geoffrey Moore]] (1991) and R. Frank and P. Cook&lt;ref&gt;Frank, R. and Cook, P. ''The Winner Take All Society'', Free Press, New York, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; also detected a shift in the nature of competition. Markets driven by technical standards or by "network effects" can give the dominant firm a near-monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch17.pdf Network Eﬀects]&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true of networked industries in which [[interoperability]] requires compatibility between users. Examples include [[Internet Explorer]]'s and [[Amazon.com|Amazon's]] early dominance of their respective industries. IE's later decline shows that such dominance may be only temporary.

Moore showed how firms could attain this enviable position by using E.M. Rogers' five stage [[diffusion (business)|adoption process]] and focusing on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for reaching the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between introduction and mass acceptance. (See [[Crossing the Chasm]]). If successful a firm can create a bandwagon effect in which the momentum builds and its product becomes a ''de facto'' standard.

==Strategy as adapting to change==
In 1969, [[Peter Drucker]] coined the phrase '''Age of Discontinuity''' to describe the way change disrupts lives.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter ''The Age of Discontinuity'', Heinemann, London, 1969 (also Harper and Row, New York, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; In an age of continuity attempts to predict the future by extrapolating from the past can be accurate. But according to Drucker, we are now in an age of discontinuity and extrapolating is ineffective. He identifies four sources of discontinuity: new [[technologies]], [[globalization]], [[cultural pluralism]] and knowledge capital.

In 1970, [[Alvin Toffler]] in ''Future Shock'' described a trend towards accelerating rates of change.&lt;ref&gt;Toffler, Alvin ''Future Shock'', Bantom Books, New York, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; He illustrated how social and technical phenomena had shorter lifespans with each generation, and he questioned society's ability to cope with the resulting turmoil and accompanying anxiety. In past eras periods of change were always punctuated with times of stability. This allowed society to assimilate the change before the next change arrived. But these periods of stability had all but disappeared by the late 20th century. In 1980 in ''The Third Wave'', Toffler characterized this shift to relentless change as the defining feature of the third phase of civilization (the first two phases being the agricultural and industrial waves).&lt;ref&gt;Toffler, Alvin ''The Third Wave'', Bantom Books, New York, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[Derek F. Abell]] (Abell, D. 1978) described "strategic windows" and stressed the importance of the timing (both entrance and exit) of any given strategy. This led some strategic planners to build [[planned obsolescence (business)|planned obsolescence]] into their strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Abell, Derek “Strategic windows”, ''Journal of Marketing'', Vol 42, pg 21–28, July 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Noel Tichy]] wrote that because we are all beings of habit we tend to repeat what we are comfortable with.&lt;ref&gt;Tichy, Noel ''Managing Strategic Change: Technical, political, and cultural dynamics'', [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], New York, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that this is a trap that constrains our [[creativity]], prevents us from exploring new ideas, and hampers our dealing with the full [[complexity]] of new issues. He developed a systematic method of dealing with change that involved looking at any new issue from three angles: technical and production, political and resource allocation, and [[corporate culture]].

In 1989, [[Charles Handy]] identified two types of change.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, Charles ''The Age of Unreason'', Hutchinson, London, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; "Strategic drift" is a gradual change that occurs so subtly that it is not noticed until it is too late. By contrast, "transformational change" is sudden and radical. It is typically caused by discontinuities (or [[exogenous]] shocks) in the business environment. The point where a new trend is initiated is called a "strategic inflection point" by [[Andy Grove]]. Inflection points can be subtle or radical.

In 1990, Richard Pascale wrote that relentless change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Pascale, Richard ''Managing on the Edge'', Simon and Schuster, New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; His famous maxim is “Nothing fails like success” by which he means that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, We tend to depend on what worked yesterday and refuse to let go of what worked so well for us in the past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self-renewal based on constructive conflict.

In 1996, [[Adrian Slywotzky]] showed how changes in the business environment are reflected in [[value migration]]s between industries, between companies, and within companies.&lt;ref&gt;Slywotzky, Adrian ''Value Migration'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that recognizing the patterns behind these value migrations is necessary if we wish to understand the world of chaotic change. In “Profit Patterns” (1999) he described businesses as being in a state of '''strategic anticipation''' as they try to spot emerging patterns. Slywotsky and his team identified 30 patterns that have transformed industry after industry.&lt;ref&gt;Slywotzky, A., Morrison, D., Moser, T., Mundt, K., and Quella, J. ''Profit Patterns'', Time Business (Random House), New York, 1999, {{ISBN|0-8129-3118-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Clayton Christensen]] (1997) took the position that great companies can fail precisely because they do everything right since the capabilities of the organization also define its disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Clayton "The Innovator's Dilemma," Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen's thesis is that outstanding companies lose their market leadership when confronted with '''[[disruptive technology]]'''. He called the approach to discovering the emerging markets for disruptive technologies '''agnostic marketing''', i.e., marketing under the implicit assumption that no one – not the company, not the customers – can know how or in what quantities a disruptive product can or will be used without the experience of using it.

In 1999, Constantinos Markides reexamined the nature of strategic planning.&lt;ref&gt;Markides, Constantinos “A dynamic view of strategy” ''Sloan Management Review'', vol 40, spring 1999, pp55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; He described strategy formation and implementation as an ongoing, never-ending, integrated process requiring continuous reassessment and reformation. Strategic management is planned and emergent, dynamic and interactive.

J. Moncrieff (1999) stressed [[strategy dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;Moncrieff, J. “Is strategy making a difference?” ''Long Range Planning Review'', vol 32, no2, pp273–276.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that strategy is partially deliberate and partially unplanned. The unplanned element comes from emergent strategies that result from the emergence of opportunities and threats in the environment and from "strategies in action" (ad hoc actions across the organization).

[[David Teece]] pioneered research on resource-based strategic management and the [[dynamic capabilities]] perspective, defined as “the ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address rapidly changing environments".&lt;ref name="dynamic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Teece|first1= David J.|last2= Pisano|first2= Gary|last3= Shuen|first3= Amy|title= Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management|journal= [[Strategic Management Journal]]|volume= 18|issue= 7|pages= 509–533|publisher= [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date= August 1997|url= http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charlesw/s591/Bocconi-Duke/Papers/C10/TeecePisanoShuenSMJ.pdf|doi= 10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::aid-smj882&gt;3.0.co;2-z|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111124231856/http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charlesw/s591/Bocconi-Duke/Papers/C10/TeecePisanoShuenSMJ.pdf|archivedate= 2011-11-24|df= }}|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::AID-SMJ882&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z
&lt;/ref&gt; His 1997 paper (with Gary Pisano and Amy Shuen) "Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management" was the most cited paper in economics and business for the period from 1995 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://archive.sciencewatch.com/nov-dec2005/sw_nov-dec2005_page1.htm|title= Taking Care of Business, 1995–2005|work= ScienceWatch|publisher= [[Thomson Scientific]]|date= November–December 2005|accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Gary Hamel]] discussed '''strategic decay''', the notion that the value of every strategy, no matter how brilliant, decays over time.&lt;ref name="Hamel, Gary 2002"&gt;Hamel, Gary ''Leading the Revolution'', Plume (Penguin Books), New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy as operational excellence==

===Quality===
A large group of theorists felt the area where western business was most lacking was product quality. [[W. Edwards Deming]],&lt;ref&gt;Deming, W.E. ''Quality, Productivity, and Competitive Position'', MIT Center for Advanced Engineering, Cambridge Mass., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph M. Juran]],&lt;ref&gt;Juran, J.M. ''Juran on Quality'', Free Press, New York, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. Kearney]],&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, A.T. ''Total Quality Management: A business process perspective'', Kearney Pree Inc, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip B. Crosby|Philip Crosby]]&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, P. ''Quality is Free'', McGraw Hill, New York, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Armand Feignbaum]]&lt;ref&gt;Feignbaum, A. ''Total Quality Control'', 3rd edition, McGraw Hill, Maidenhead, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested quality improvement techniques such [[total quality management]] (TQM), [[kaizen|continuous improvement]] (kaizen), [[lean manufacturing]], [[Six Sigma]], and [[return on quality]] (ROQ).

Contrarily, James Heskett (1988),&lt;ref&gt;Heskett, J. ''Managing in the Service Economy'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not sure if this is the right reference --&gt; Earl Sasser (1995), William Davidow,&lt;ref&gt;Davidow, W. and Uttal, B. ''Total Customer Service'', [[Harper Perennial]] Books, New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Len Schlesinger,&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, L. and Heskett, J. "Customer Satisfaction is rooted in Employee Satisfaction," ''Harvard Business Review'', November–December 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; A. Paraurgman (1988), Len Berry,&lt;ref&gt;Berry, L. ''On Great Service'', Free Press, New York, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Jane Kingman-Brundage,&lt;ref&gt;Kingman-Brundage, J. “Service Mapping” pp 148–163 In Scheuing, E. and Christopher, W. (eds.), ''The Service Quality Handbook'', Amacon, New York, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Hart, and Christopher Lovelock (1994), felt that poor customer service was the problem. They gave us [[fishbone diagram]]ming, [[service chart]]ing, [[Total Customer Service]] (TCS), the service profit chain, service gaps analysis, the service encounter, strategic service vision, service mapping, and service teams. Their underlying assumption was that there is no better source of competitive advantage than a continuous stream of delighted customers.

[[Process management]] uses some of the techniques from product quality management and some of the techniques from customer service management. It looks at an activity as a sequential process. The objective is to find inefficiencies and make the process more effective. Although the procedures have a long history, dating back to [[Taylorism]], the scope of their applicability has been greatly widened, leaving no aspect of the firm free from potential process improvements. Because of the broad applicability of process management techniques, they can be used as a basis for competitive advantage.

Carl Sewell,&lt;ref&gt;Sewell, C. and Brown, P. ''Customers for Life'', Doubleday Currency, New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick F. Reichheld]],&lt;ref&gt;Reichheld, F. ''The Loyalty Effect'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; C. Gronroos,&lt;ref&gt;Gronroos, C. “From marketing mix to relationship marketing: towards a paradigm shift in marketing”, ''Management Decision'', Vol. 32, No. 2, pp 4–32, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and Earl Sasser&lt;ref&gt;Reichheld, F. and Sasser, E. “Zero defects: Quality comes to services”, ''Harvard Business Review'', September/October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; observed that businesses were spending more on customer acquisition than on retention. They showed how a competitive advantage could be found in ensuring that customers returned again and again. Reicheld broadened the concept to include loyalty from employees, suppliers, distributors and shareholders. They developed techniques for estimating [[customer lifetime value]] (CLV) for assessing long-term relationships. The concepts begat attempts to recast selling and marketing into a long term endeavor that created a sustained relationship (called relationship selling, [[relationship marketing]], and [[customer relationship management]]). Customer relationship management (CRM) software became integral to many firms.

===Reengineering===
[[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] and [[James Champy]] felt that these resources needed to be restructured.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, M. and Champy, J. ''Reengineering the Corporation'', Harper Business, New York, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In a process that they labeled [[Business process reengineering|reengineering]], firms reorganized their assets around whole processes rather than tasks. In this way a team of people saw a project through, from inception to completion. This avoided functional silos where isolated departments seldom talked to each other. It also eliminated waste due to functional overlap and interdepartmental communications.

In 1989 [[Richard Lester]] and the researchers at the MIT Industrial Performance Center identified seven '''best practices''' and concluded that firms must accelerate the shift away from the mass production of low cost standardized products. The seven areas of best practice were:&lt;ref&gt;Lester, R. ''Made in America'', MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity, Boston, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Simultaneous continuous improvement in cost, quality, service, and product innovation
* Breaking down organizational barriers between departments
* Eliminating layers of management creating flatter organizational hierarchies.
* Closer relationships with customers and suppliers
* Intelligent use of new technology
* Global focus
* Improving human resource skills

The search for best practices is also called [[benchmarking]].&lt;ref&gt;Camp, R. ''Benchmarking: The search for industry best practices that lead to superior performance'', American Society for Quality Control, Quality Press, Milwaukee, Wis., 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; This involves determining where you need to improve, finding an organization that is exceptional in this area, then studying the company and applying its best practices in your firm.

==Other perspectives on strategy==

===Strategy as problem solving===
Professor Richard P. Rumelt described strategy as a type of problem solving in 2011. He wrote that good strategy has an underlying structure called a ''kernel''.  The kernel has three parts: 1) A ''diagnosis'' that defines or explains the nature of the challenge; 2) A ''guiding policy'' for dealing with the challenge; and 3) Coherent ''actions'' designed to carry out the guiding policy.&lt;ref name="Rumelt2011"&gt;{{cite book

President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] outlined these three elements of strategy in his [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] Address to the Nation of 22 October 1962: 
#Diagnosis: "This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere."
#Guiding Policy: "Our unswerving objective, therefore, must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the Western Hemisphere."
#Action Plans: First among seven numbered steps was the following: "To halt this offensive buildup a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkcubanmissilecrisis.html American Rhetoric-President John F. Kennedy-Cuban Missile Crisis Address to the Nation-22 October 1962]&lt;/ref&gt;

Active strategic management required active information gathering and active problem solving. In the early days of Hewlett-Packard (HP), [[Dave Packard]] and [[Bill Hewlett]] devised an active management style that they called ''[[management by walking around]]'' (MBWA). Senior HP managers were seldom at their desks. They spent most of their days visiting employees, customers, and suppliers. This direct contact with key people provided them with a solid grounding from which viable strategies could be crafted. [[Management consultant]]s [[Tom Peters]] and [[Robert H. Waterman]] had used the term in their 1982 book ''[[In Search of Excellence: Lessons From America's Best-Run Companies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of Excellence: Lessons From America's Best-Run Companies |authorlink1=Tom Peters |last1=Peters |first1=Tom |authorlink2=Robert H. Waterman |last2=Waterman |first2=Robert H. |year=1982 |page=289}} {{Google books|knzNIfmU2F0C|Management By Wandering Around|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Japanese managers employ a similar system, which originated at [[Honda]], and is sometimes called the 3 G's ([[Gemba|Genba]], Genbutsu, and Genjitsu, which translate into "actual place", "actual thing", and "actual situation").

===Creative vs analytic approaches===
In 2010, IBM released a study summarizing three conclusions of 1500 CEOs around the world: 1) complexity is escalating, 2) enterprises are not equipped to cope with this complexity, and 3) creativity is now the single most important leadership competency. IBM said that it is needed in all aspects of leadership, including strategic thinking and planning.&lt;ref&gt;IBM, Capitalizing on Complexity: Insights from the Global Chief Executive Office Study, July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Max McKeown|McKeown]] argued that over-reliance on any particular approach to strategy is dangerous and that multiple methods can be used to combine the creativity and analytics to create an "approach to shaping the future", that is difficult to copy.&lt;ref&gt;Mckeown, Max, The Strategy Book, FT Prentice Hall, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-strategic management===
A 1938 treatise by [[Chester Barnard]], based on his own experience as a business executive, described the process as informal, intuitive, non-routinized and involving primarily oral, 2-way communications. Bernard says "The process is the sensing of the organization as a whole and the total situation relevant to it. It transcends the capacity of merely intellectual methods, and the techniques of discriminating the factors of the situation. The terms pertinent to it are "feeling", "judgement", "sense", "proportion", "balance", "appropriateness". It is a matter of art rather than science."&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Chester ''The function of the executive'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge Mass, 1938, page 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Mintzberg found that senior managers typically deal with unpredictable situations so they strategize in ''ad hoc'', flexible, dynamic, and implicit ways. He wrote, "The job breeds adaptive information-manipulators who prefer the live concrete situation. The manager works in an environment of stimulus-response, and he develops in his work a clear preference for live action."&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, Henry ''The Nature of Managerial Work'', Harper and Roe, New York, 1973, page 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[John Kotter]] studied the daily activities of 15 executives and concluded that they spent most of their time developing and working a network of relationships that provided general insights and specific details for strategic decisions. They tended to use "mental road maps" rather than systematic planning techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Kotter, John ''The general manager'', Free Press, New York, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Isenberg]]'s 1984 study of senior managers found that their decisions were highly intuitive. Executives often sensed what they were going to do before they could explain why.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Daniel "How managers think", ''Harvard Business Review'', November–December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed in 1986 that one of the reasons for this is the complexity of strategic decisions and the resultant information uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Daniel ''Strategic Opportunism: Managing under uncertainty'', Harvard Graduate School of Business, Working paper 9-786-020, Boston, January 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuboff claimed that information technology was widening the divide between senior managers (who typically make strategic decisions) and operational level managers (who typically make routine decisions). She alleged that prior to the widespread use of computer systems, managers, even at the most senior level, engaged in both strategic decisions and routine administration, but as computers facilitated (She called it "deskilled") routine processes, these activities were moved further down the hierarchy, leaving senior management free for strategic decision making.

In 1977, [[Abraham Zaleznik]] distinguished leaders from managers. He described leaders as visionaries who inspire, while managers care about process.&lt;ref&gt;Zaleznik, Abraham "Managers and Leaders: Are they different?", ''Harvard Business Review'', May–June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the rise of managers was the main cause of the decline of American business in the 1970s and 1980s. Lack of leadership is most damaging at the level of strategic management where it can paralyze an entire organization.&lt;ref&gt;Zaleznik, Abraham ''The Managerial Mistique'', Harper and Row, New York, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Corner, Kinichi, and Keats,&lt;ref&gt;Corner, P. Kinicki, A. and Keats, B. "Integrating organizational and individual information processing perspectives on choice", ''Organizational Science'', vol. 3, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; strategic decision making in organizations occurs at two levels: individual and aggregate. They developed a model of parallel strategic decision making. The model identifies two parallel processes that involve getting attention, encoding information, storage and retrieval of information, strategic choice, strategic outcome and feedback. The individual and organizational processes interact at each stage. For instance, competition-oriented objectives are based on the knowledge of competing firms, such as their market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/CompOrientPDF%2011-27%20%282%29.pdf | title = Competitor-oriented Objectives: The Myth of Market Share | author1 = J.

===Strategy as marketing===
The 1980s also saw the widespread acceptance of [[positioning (marketing)|positioning theory]]. Although the theory originated with [[Jack Trout]] in 1969, it didn’t gain wide acceptance until [[Al Ries]] and [[Jack Trout]] wrote their classic book ''Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind'' (1979). The basic premise is that a strategy should not be judged by internal company factors but by the way customers see it relative to the competition. Crafting and implementing a strategy involves creating a position in the mind of the collective consumer. Several techniques enabled the practical use of positioning theory. [[Perceptual mapping]] for example, creates visual displays of the relationships between positions. [[Multidimensional scaling (in marketing)|Multidimensional scaling]], [[discriminant analysis (in marketing)|discriminant analysis]], [[factor analysis]] and [[conjoint analysis (in marketing)|conjoint analysis]] are mathematical techniques used to determine the most relevant characteristics (called dimensions or factors) upon which positions should be based. [[Preference regression (in marketing)|Preference regression]] can be used to determine vectors of ideal positions and [[cluster analysis (in marketing)|cluster analysis]] can identify clusters of positions.

In 1992 Jay Barney saw strategy as assembling the optimum mix of resources, including human, technology and suppliers, and then configuring them in unique and sustainable ways.&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. (1991) "Firm Resources and Sustainable Competitive Advantage", ''Journal of Management'', vol 17, no 1, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Not sure if this is the right reference.--&gt;

James Gilmore and Joseph Pine found competitive advantage in [[mass customization]].&lt;ref&gt;Pine, J. and Gilmore, J. "The Four Faces of Mass Customization", ''Harvard Business Review'', Vol 75, No 1, Jan–Feb 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flexible manufacturing]] techniques allowed businesses to individualize products for each customer without losing [[economies of scale]]. This effectively turned the product into a service. They also realized that if a service is mass-customized by creating a "performance" for each individual client, that service would be transformed into an "experience". Their book, ''The Experience Economy'',&lt;ref&gt;Pine, J. and Gilmore, J. (1999) ''The Experience Economy'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; along with the work of [[Bernd Schmitt]] convinced many to see service provision as a form of theatre. This school of thought is sometimes referred to as [[customer experience management]] (CEM).

===Information- and technology-driven strategy===
Many industries with a high information component are being transformed.&lt;ref&gt;Evens, P. and Wurster, T. "Strategy and the New Economics of Information", ''Harvard Business Review'', Sept/Oct 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Encarta demolished [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (whose sales have plummeted 80% since their peak of $650 million in 1990) before it was in turn, eclipsed by collaborative encyclopedias like [[Wikipedia]]. The music industry was similarly disrupted. The technology sector has provided some strategies directly. For example, from the software development industry [[agile software development]] provides a model for shared development processes.

[[Peter Drucker]] conceived of the "knowledge worker" in the 1950s. He described how fewer workers would do physical labor, and more would apply their minds. In 1984, [[John Naisbitt]] theorized that the future would be driven largely by information: companies that managed information well could obtain an advantage, however the profitability of what he called "information float" (information that the company had and others desired) would disappear as inexpensive computers made information more accessible.

[[Daniel Bell]] (1985) examined the sociological consequences of information technology, while Gloria Schuck and [[Shoshana Zuboff]] looked at psychological factors.&lt;ref&gt;Schuck, Gloria "Intelligent Workers: A new pedagogy for the high tech workplace", ''Organizational Dynamics'', Autumn 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Zuboff distinguished between "automating technologies" and "informating technologies".&lt;!-- how?--&gt; She studied the effect that both had on workers, managers and organizational structures. She largely confirmed Drucker's predictions about the importance of flexible decentralized structure, work teams, knowledge sharing and the knowledge worker's central role. Zuboff also detected a new basis for managerial authority, based on knowledge (also predicted by Drucker) which she called "participative management".&lt;ref&gt;Zuboff, Shoshana ''In the Age of the Smart Machine'', Basic Books, New York, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maturity of planning process===
[[McKinsey &amp; Company]] developed a [[capability maturity model]] in the 1970s to describe the sophistication of planning processes, with strategic management ranked the highest. The four stages include:
#Financial planning, which is primarily about annual budgets and a functional focus, with limited regard for the environment;
#Forecast-based planning, which includes multi-year budgets and more robust capital allocation across business units;
#Externally oriented planning, where a thorough situation analysis and competitive assessment is performed; 
#Strategic management, where widespread [[strategic thinking]] occurs and a well-defined strategic framework is used.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt;

===PIMS study===
The long-term [[PIMS study]], started in the 1960s and lasting for 19 years, attempted to understand the Profit Impact of Marketing Strategies ([[Profit impact of marketing strategy|PIMS]]), particularly the effect of market share. The initial conclusion of the study was unambiguous: the greater a company's market share, the greater their [[rate of profit]]. Market share provides [[economies of scale]]. It also provides [[experience curve]] advantages. The combined effect is increased profits.&lt;ref&gt;Buzzell, R. and Gale, B. ''The PIMS Principles: Linking Strategy to Performance'', Free Press, New York, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of high market share naturally led to an interest in growth strategies. The relative advantages of [[horizontal integration]], [[vertical integration]], diversification, [[Franchising|franchise]]s, [[mergers and acquisitions]], joint ventures and organic growth were discussed. Other research indicated that a low market share strategy could still be very profitable. Schumacher (1973),&lt;ref&gt;[[Schumacher, E.F.]] ''[[Small is Beautiful: a Study of Economics as if People Mattered]]'', {{ISBN|0-06-131778-0}} (also {{ISBN|0-88179-169-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Woo and Cooper (1982),&lt;ref&gt;Woo, C. and Cooper, A. “The surprising case for low market share”, ''Harvard Business Review'', November–December 1982, pg 106–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Levenson (1984),&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, J.C. ''Guerrilla Marketing, Secrets for making big profits from your small business'', Houghton Muffin Co. New York, 1984, {{ISBN|0-618-78591-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and later Traverso (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Traverso, D. ''Outsmarting Goliath'', Bloomberg Press, Princeton, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; showed how smaller niche players obtained very high returns.

==Other influences on business strategy==

===Military strategy===
{{See also|Military strategy}}
In the 1980s business strategists realized that there was a vast [[knowledge base]] stretching back thousands of years that they had barely examined. They turned to [[military strategy]] for guidance. Military strategy books such as ''[[The Art of War]]'' by [[Sun Tzu]], ''[[On War]]'' by [[Carl von Clausewitz|von Clausewitz]], and ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao|The Red Book]]'' by [[Mao Zedong]] became business classics. From Sun Tzu, they learned the tactical side of military strategy and specific tactical prescriptions. From von Clausewitz, they learned the dynamic and unpredictable nature of military action. From Mao, they learned the principles of [[guerrilla warfare]]. Important [[marketing warfare strategies|marketing warfare]] books include ''Business War Games'' by Barrie James, ''Marketing Warfare'' by [[Al Ries]] and [[Jack Trout]] and ''Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun'' by Wess Roberts.

The four types of business warfare theories are:
* [[Offensive marketing warfare strategies]]
* [[Defensive marketing warfare strategies]]
* [[Flanking marketing warfare strategies]]
* [[Guerrilla marketing warfare strategies]]

The marketing warfare literature also examined leadership and motivation, intelligence gathering, types of marketing weapons, logistics and communications.

By the twenty-first century marketing warfare strategies had gone out of favour in favor of non-confrontational approaches. In 1989, Dudley Lynch and Paul L. Kordis published ''Strategy of the Dolphin: Scoring a Win in a Chaotic World''. "The Strategy of the Dolphin" was developed to give guidance as to when to use aggressive strategies and when to use passive strategies. A variety of [[Aggressiveness strategies (business)|aggressiveness strategies]] were developed.

In 1993, J. Moore used a similar metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, J. "Predators and Prey", ''Harvard Business Review'', Vol. 71, May–June, pp 75–86, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using military terms, he created an [[ecological theory]] of predators and prey(see [[ecological model of competition]]), a sort of [[Darwinian]] management strategy in which market interactions mimic long term [[ecological stability]].

Author Phillip Evans said in 2014 that "[[Bruce Henderson|Henderson's]] central idea was what you might call the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, in the business world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns—scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. ... It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ted.com/talks/philip_evans_how_data_will_transform_business/transcript TED-Phillip Evans-How Data will Transform Business-March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traits of successful companies==
Like Peters and Waterman a decade earlier, [[James Collins (management theorist)|James Collins]] and [[Jerry Porras]] spent years conducting empirical research on what makes great companies. Six years of research uncovered a key underlying principle behind the 19 successful companies that they studied: They all encourage and preserve a '''core ideology''' that nurtures the company. Even though strategy and tactics change daily, the companies, nevertheless, were able to maintain a core set of values. These core values encourage employees to build an organization that lasts. In ''Built To Last'' (1994) they claim that short term profit goals, cost cutting, and restructuring will not stimulate dedicated employees to build a great company that will endure.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, James and Porras, Jerry ''Built to Last'', Harper Books, New York, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Collins coined the term "built to flip" to describe the prevailing business attitudes in Silicon Valley. It describes a business culture where technological change inhibits a long term focus. He also popularized the concept of the BHAG ([[Big Hairy Audacious Goal]]).

[[Arie de Geus]] (1997) undertook a similar study and obtained similar results.&lt;ref name="Geus1997"/&gt; He identified four key traits of companies that had prospered for 50 years or more. They are:
* Sensitivity to the business environment – the ability to learn and adjust
* Cohesion and identity – the ability to build a community with personality, vision, and purpose
* Tolerance and decentralization – the ability to build relationships
* Conservative financing

A company with these key characteristics he called a ''living company'' because it is able to perpetuate itself. If a company emphasizes knowledge rather than finance, and sees itself as an ongoing community of human beings, it has the potential to become great and endure for decades. Such an organization is an organic entity capable of learning (he called it a "learning organization") and capable of creating its own processes, goals, and persona.&lt;ref name="Geus1997"&gt;{{cite book

| first = Arie
| year = 1997

Will Mulcaster&lt;ref&gt;Mulcaster, W.R. "Three Strategic Frameworks," Business Strategy Series, Vol 10, No 1, pp 68–75, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that firms engage in a dialogue that centres around these questions:

*Will the proposed competitive advantage create Perceived Differential Value?"
*Will the proposed competitive advantage create something that is different from the competition?"
*Will the difference add value in the eyes of potential customers?" – This question will entail a discussion of the combined effects of price, product features and consumer perceptions.
*Will the product add value for the firm?" – Answering this question will require an examination of cost effectiveness and the pricing strategy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6713">'''Test and Learn''' is a set of practices followed by retailers, banks and other consumer-focused companies to test ideas in a small number of locations or customers to predict impact. The process is often designed to answer three questions about any tested program before rollout: 

# What impact will the program have on key performance indicators if executed across the network or customer base? 
# Will the program have a larger impact on some stores/customers than others? 
# Which components of the idea are actually working?

== Historical context ==

Test and Learn has been systematically applied as far back as 1988 by [[Capital One]]. Capital One has been aggressive about testing since the firm was founded, testing everything from product design to marketing to customer selection to collection policies.&lt;ref name="hbr"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2009/02/how-to-design-smart-business-experiments|title=How to Design Smart Business Experiments|last=Davenport|first=Thomas H.|date=February 2009|newspaper=[[Harvard Business Review]]|access-date=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|authorlink=Thomas H. Davenport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a single year, the company performs tens of thousands of tests, allowing it to offer thousands of different types of credit cards to customers, based on the knowledge gained from their tests. Richard Fairbank, [[CEO]] of Capital One, called test and learn "a marketing revolution that can be applied to many businesses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Test and Learn is also methodically used online to test impact of various web page layouts on user behavior. Tools such as [[Google]] Website Analyzer provide every site with the ability to test various elements and their effect on user engagement.

==Test and learn software==
There are a variety of [[Computer software|software]] tools available today to support systematic testing within an organization. However, there is currently no one software package that covers all types of tests, and in some cases significant knowledge of statistics is still required for effective analysis.&lt;ref name="hbr" /&gt;

Many companies, including [[Capital One]] and [[eBay]], have developed experiment management software within the company. Alternatives to internal solutions include broad [[statistical analysis]] software tools such as [[SAS Institute|SAS]] or test and learn focused software from [[Applied Predictive Technologies]] or MarketDial. There are also a variety of more narrowly tailored products, focused on particular problems or fields. In [[web analytics]], for example, firms such as [[Omniture]], [[WebTrends]], and [[Google]] have created specialized software.&lt;ref name="hbr" /&gt;

== Criticism ==

Companies wanting to conduct Test and Learn must mobilize, track and analyze site and customer data at very granular levels. This can often be a massive and expensive undertaking. Increasingly however, an exponential increase in computing power, and corresponding decrease in its cost, have made testing more accessible. In the [[Harvard Business Review]] February 2009 article "How to Design Smart Business Experiments",&lt;ref name="hbr" /&gt; Thomas Davenport discusses the Test and Learn Process, and describes how several companies have overcome these and other barriers to testing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2989">{{Insolvency}}
In law, a '''voidable floating charge''' refers to a [[floating charge]] entered into shortly prior to the [[company (law)|company]] going into [[liquidation]] which is [[void (law)|void]] or [[unenforceable]] in whole or in part under applicable insolvency legislation.&lt;ref&gt;See for example section 245 of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and section 267 of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32) in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, a floating charge is only potentially vulnerable if it is entered into within the vulnerability period under applicable law. The vulnerability period is a period prescribed by statute immediately preceding the company going into liquidation. Most jurisdictions provide for alternative vulnerability periods: a longer one for parties who are "connected" to the company, and a shorter one for unrelated third parties.&lt;ref&gt; Under English law, a floating charge in favour of an unconnected third party is only vulnerable if the company goes into liquidation within the next 12 months, but a floating charge in favour of a connected person is vulnerable if the company goes into liquidation within the next 2 years.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of laws relating to voidable floating charges varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some countries simply provide that such charge are automatically void or not enforceable,&lt;ref&gt;Under English law they are stated to be "invalid", which is taken to mean unenforceable.&lt;/ref&gt; In other jurisdictions, they are only [[voidable]] and an application must be made by a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] or creditor for the floating charge to be set aside.

In most jurisdictions, a floating charge is only vulnerable to the extent that it does not secure new money for the company.&lt;ref&gt;See for example section 245(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; So if a bank has a loan of £100 outstanding to a company, and it advances a further £50 but takes an "all-monies" floating charge as security, and the company goes into liquidation 3 months later, the floating charge will validly secure the £50 advance which was made at the time, but not the earlier £100. Legislation relating to voidable floating charges is intended to prevent abuse of a [[security interest]] which catches literally all of the assets of the company, and could be used by person to strip out all of the assets from a company in difficulty from the [[unsecured creditor]]s. However, if the holder of the floating charge has inserted new money, then giving the holder a valid security up to the amount of the new money injected does not prejudice the position of the unsecured creditors.

Most legislation relating to voidable floating charges is also expressed to apply to charges which, as created, were floating charges but which subsequently crystallised into fixed charges.

'''Wellington Timothy Mara''' (August 14, 1916 – October 25, 2005) was the co-owner of the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) from 1959 until his death, and one of the most influential and iconic figures in the history of the NFL. He was the younger son of [[Tim Mara]], who founded the Giants in 1925. Wellington was a [[ball boy]] for that year.

==Life and career==
Mara was born in [[Rochester, New York]], the son of Elizabeth "Lizette" (née Barclay), a homemaker, and [[Tim Mara|Timothy James Mara]].&lt;ref name="nytimes63"&gt;{{cite news|title=MRS. TIMOTHY J. MARA|work=New York Times|date=1963-07-23|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/07/23/archives/mrs-timothy-j-mara.html|accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of Irish descent. Mara was an [[alumnus]] of [[Loyola School (United States)|Loyola School]] and [[Fordham University]], both [[New York City]] [[Jesuit]] schools.

In 1930, Timothy James Mara split his ownership interests between Wellington (then 14) and his older brother [[Jack Mara|Jack]]. Soon after graduating from [[Fordham University]], Wellington moved into the Giants' front office as team treasurer and assistant to his father.  He became the team's secretary in 1940.  After fighting in World War II, he returned to the Giants as team vice president, a post he retained after his father died in 1958.  When Jack, who had been president since 1941, died in 1965, Wellington became team president.  

For his first 37 years in the organization, he handled the franchise's football decisions.  However, his growing involvement in league affairs led him to turn over most of his day-to-day responsibilities to operations director [[Andy Robustelli]] in 1974.  He didn't relinquish full control over the football side of the operation until 1979, when [[George Young (American football executive)|George Young]] became the team's first general manager.

The Giants were hamstrung for several years by a strained relationship between Wellington and his nephew, [[Timothy J. Mara|Tim J. Mara]], who inherited Jack's stake in the team upon Jack's death.  By the 1970s, they almost never spoke to each other, and a partition had to be built in the owners' box.  The Maras continued to retain close control over the Giants' day-to-day operations long after most other owners had delegated such authority.  Only the fallout from the 1978 [[Miracle at the Meadowlands|Fumble]], in which a certain Giant win turned into a loss to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] on a last-second fumble, convinced the Maras of the need to modernize--among other things, by hiring Young and giving him full control over football operations.

Under Mara's direction the New York Football Giants won six NFL titles (including two [[Super Bowl]] wins), nine conference championships (including six Eastern Conference championships in the days before the NFL-AFL merger and three NFC championships post-merger), and 13 division championships. An eighth NFL title, third and fourth Super Bowl victories, fifth NFC championship (11th conference championship overall), and 15th division title have been captured since his passing under the leadership of his son, [[John Mara|John]], and co-owner [[Steve Tisch]] (who in turn is the son of Wellington's former co-owner from 1991–2005, [[Bob Tisch]]; Tisch also died in 2005, with his death coming three weeks after Mara's).

The Giants have also accumulated the third highest number of victories in National Football League history. Mara was also well liked by the Giants' players, and was known to stick by them even when they struggled with off-the-field problems. When [[Lawrence Taylor]] was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1999 he credited Mara for supporting him even during the worst times of his drug addiction saying, "He probably cared more about me as a person than he really should have."&lt;ref name="induct"&gt;sportsillustrated.cnn.com, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/1999/08/07/halloffame_ceremony_ap/ Five for the ages: Pro Football Hall of Fame inducts five more members], accessed February 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor has since lived a clean life style and credits Mara with helping him fight his addiction.&lt;ref name="Losing himself"&gt;Dave Anderson, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02EEDD153AF93BA15752C1A9659C8B63 PRO FOOTBALL; Losing Himself to Find Himself], ''New York Times'', November 28, 2003, accessed April 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:1 Mara 800.jpg|thumb|300px|The grave of Wellington Mara in [[Gate of Heaven Cemetery]]]] He had surgery in May 2005 to remove [[cancerous]] [[lymph nodes]] from his neck and under his armpit, but was initially given a good prognosis by his doctors who said the cancer had not [[metastasized]], according to his son, [[John Mara]], who is the Giants' co-chief executive officer.

Not long after Mara came to work with the team, the players--many of whom were barely older than him--nicknamed him "Duke" because they knew he was named after the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], whom his father called "the fightingest of all Irishmen."  The nickname stuck.  The Wilson football used in NFL games prior to the AFL merger (1941–69) was nicknamed "THE DUKE" after Mara.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wilson.com/en-us/football/nfl/wilson-and-the-nfl/history/;jsessionid=F778176F5935A23A9E5C363660A75A0A&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2006 season and beyond, a new version of "THE DUKE" has been used in NFL games.

He was enshrined in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1997. Mara was married to [[Ann Mara]]. His granddaughters include actresses [[Kate Mara]] and [[Rooney Mara]].

In 2012, Mara was elected into the [[New Jersey Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=[[The Newark Star Ledger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Wellington Mara succumbed to [[lymphoma]] in 2005 at age 89. He was interred at [[Gate of Heaven Cemetery]] in Hawthorne, New York, after his funeral at New York's [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|Saint Patrick's Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/29/sports/football/29mara.html|work=The New York Times|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|title=Mara Is Remembered as a Giant Among Men|date=October 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/top-10-moments-in-the-giants-redskins-rivalry/|work=The New York Times|first=Greg|last=Hanlon|title=Top 10 Moments in the Giants-Redskins Rivalry|date=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife [[Ann Mara]] (1929-2015), 11 children, and 42 grandchildren. His team honored him after his death by defeating the [[Washington Redskins]], the team he always viewed as the Giants' biggest (and oldest) rival, 36–0 on Oct. 30, 2005 at Giants Stadium.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The 80,000 fans in attendance gave his mention a standing ovation.

'''Wesley Batista''' ([[Formosa (Goiás)|Formosa]], born December 8, 1972) is a Brazilian entrepreneur and founder of [[JBS S.A.]] Wesley Batista is the president of the JBS group and is responsible for the implementation of JBS operations in the USA since the acquisition of Swift in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epoca.globo.com/politica/noticia/2017/05/quem-sao-os-irmaos-bilionarios-que-podem-derrubar-michel-temer.html Wesley Batista: quem são os irmãos bilionários que podem derrubar Michel Temer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===JBS founder and president===
Wesley Batista and his brother [[Joesley Batista]] were listed in 2016 among the 70 main billionaires of Brazil by [[Forbes]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com.br/listas/2016/08/70-maiores-bilionarios-do-brasil-em-2016/ 70 maiores bilionários do Brasil em 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016: Operation Car-Wash ===

In July 2016, Wesley Batista became a suspect in the investigations of [[Operation Car Wash]]. The Brazilian Federal Police charged him for alleged bribes made by his company, [[JBS S.A.]], to the former president of the Brazilian parliament [[Eduardo Cunha]], which were intended to help JBS with the liberation of resources from the [[Fundo de Investimento do Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Serviço|FI-FGTS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/pf-faz-buscas-na-casa-de-joesley-batista-da-friboi/ PF faz buscas na casa de Joesley Batista, da Friboi]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017: Bribery and insider trading allegations ===

On May 17, 2017, the Batista brothers admitted to the Brazilian Federal Police bribing several Brazilian officers and politicians over the last 12 years. As a result of this bribes, him and his company JBS allegedly obtained funding from the [[BNDES]] of over R$10 billion at below market rates, and then using the funds to bribe politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/politica/operacao-lava-jato/noticia/jbs-pagou-para-conseguir-aportes-e-financiamentos-do-bndes-diz-delacao-de-joesley-batista.ghtml JBS pagou para conseguir aportes e financiamentos do BNDES, diz delação de Joesley Batista]&lt;/ref&gt;  As compensation for the cooperation, the Brazilian Federal Police set Batista, his brother and other directors of [[JBS S.A.]] free of charges, having to pay a penalty of R$225 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/economia/negocios/noticia/jbs-diz-que-pagara-multa-de-r-225-milhoes-em-acordo-de-colaboracao-premiada.ghtml JBS pagará multa de R$ 225 milhões em acordo de colaboração premiada]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the release of the recordings, Batista and his brother [[Joesley Batista]] sold several shares of [[JBS S.A.]] and bought over USD 1 billion. The release of the recordings resulted in substantial reduction of the stock price of JBS S.A. shares and in the reduction of the value in the Brazilian Real. The Brazilian Securities Commission ("CVM") is investigating the Batista brothers for insider trading.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-jbs-regulator-idUSKCN18F0AT Brazil watchdog opens new probes into JBS-related insider trading]&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], then Florida’s largest city, where he established a successful law practice. He divided his time between a home in Jacksonville and a farm and timber holdings in [[Clay County, Florida|Clay County]] near Middleburg.&lt;ref name=JAX&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/101307/nec_207484330.shtml My Clay Sun: October 11, 2007-W.S.

In 1905, he was appointed by Governor [[Napoleon B. Broward]] as General Counsel for the [[Internal improvements|Internal Improvement Fund]], the state agency responsible for administering public lands. The new governor also favored the development of the Everglades, so in this position, which Jennings held until 1909, he was able to continue leading drainage activities in the Everglades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/pkyonge/JenningsWilliamS.htm University of Florida Smathers libraries: Special collections-William Sherman Jennings Papers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Jennings met [[May Mann Jennings|May Mann]] at her father’s home near Brooksville, and began a courtship.&lt;ref name=EVERGLADES&gt;[http://everglades.fiu.edu/reclaim/bios/jenningsmm.htm Florida International University: Reclaiming the Everglades-May Mann Jennings]&lt;/ref&gt; May's father, Austin Mann, had been a Florida Senator and had just won election to the state house of representatives. When the legislative session began in January, 1891, May went to Tallahassee to serve as her father's aide, with responsibility for her father's appointments, correspondence and hosting social events.&lt;ref name=FTU&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/040903/nec_12220156.shtml Florida Times-Union: April 9, 2003-Wife turns into a good politician by Mary Jo McTammany]&lt;/ref&gt;
Jennings went to Tallahassee to continue his courtship. He married May Mann on May 12, 1891 and they were escorted down the aisle by the full legislative membership.&lt;ref name=FTU /&gt; The newlyweds lived in Brooksville in the [[William Sherman Jennings House]]. The couple had one child, a son, Sherman Bryan Jennings.

Politics and the law were prominent in his family. In addition to his brother, who was a lawyer and state attorney, he was a first cousin to [[William Jennings Bryan]], congressman and three-time Democratic presidential nominee.&lt;ref name=FIU /&gt;

==Civic Activities==
Jennings served as a Trustee of [[Stetson University]] during the first decade of the twentieth century and was involved in the controversy over whether the [[Florida Baptist Convention]] would elect the trustees of the university.  At one point, the controversy became so heated that Jennings and Lincoln Hulley, the President of the University, engaged in a fistfight in the lobby of the Leon Hotel in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Lycan, Stetson University:  The First 100 Years at 138 (DeLand:  Stetson University Press 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Jennings died on February 27, 1920 in [[St. Augustine, Florida]] and was buried in Jacksonville, Florida.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">'''Yoga piracy''' refers to the practice of claiming [[copyright]]s on [[yoga]] postures and techniques found in ancient treatises indigenous to [[India]]. The ongoing debate centers on those who profit by creating legally proprietary systems of yoga in countries other than India using information generally felt by Indians to be within the [[public domain]], if not proprietary traditional knowledge. Cases of Yoga Piracy often center on fitness instructors of non-Indian origin who claim copyrights on [[asana]]s (yoga poses), [[pranayama]] techniques and sequences, and [[ayurvedic]] medicine&lt;ref name="story1"&gt;[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=159889 Pune’s gurus get into the act to curb West’s yoga piracy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309070314/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=159889 |date=March 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their home countries, the most notable example being the case of [[copyright claims on Bikram Yoga]] in the [[United States]]. This has become a lucrative international industry, with some estimates for the yoga fitness industry in the United States as high as $3 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] annually.&lt;ref name="story2"&gt;[http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14045678 Westerners think twice before patenting yoga poses! - Sify.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the [[Government of India]] has initiated the documentation of 1,500 yoga asana or postures &lt;ref name="story1" /&gt; - from the ancient [[Yoga Sutras]] of [[Patanjali]] to present times - and is storing them in the [[Traditional Knowledge Digital Library]] to be made available to [[patent office]]s worldwide. {{As of|2005}}, one-third of the estimated 30 million database pages have been compiled by the Indian [[Ministry of Commerce (India)|Commerce Ministry]].&lt;ref name="story2" /&gt; Fifteen of the most prominent yoga schools in India are involved, including the [[Iyengar Institute]] and [[Kaivalyadham]], run by Nitin Unkule.&lt;ref name="story1" /&gt;

'''Zoe Cruz''' (born Zoe Papadimitriou on February 2, 1955) is a [[Greece|Greek]]-born [[United States|American]] senior banking executive and former co-president of [[Morgan Stanley]].

==Early life==
Cruz was born Zoe Papadimitriou in [[Greece]]. At the age of 14, Zoe and her parents moved to [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. She graduated from [[Radcliffe College]] &lt;ref&gt;http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/viewtext/2573641?op=t&amp;n=529&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Harvard University]] [[cum laude]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Romance Languages &amp; Literatures in 1977 and earned a [[MBA]] from [[Harvard Business School]] in 1982.

==Career==
In 1982, after graduating from business school and becoming a mother, Cruz was recruited by Morgan Stanley and had a 25-year tenure at the firm. She became a Vice President in 1986, a Principal in 1988 and a Managing Director in 1990. From 2000 to 2005, she held the position of global Head of Fixed Income, Commodities and Foreign Exchange. She was appointed Co-President on February 9, 2006.

Cruz was a longtime supporter of former CEO [[Philip J. Purcell|Phil Purcell]].  She became an integral part of the leadership controversy at Morgan Stanley on March 29, 2005, when Purcell replaced then President [[Stephan Newhouse]].  Zoe Cruz and Stephen S. Crawford were named Co-Presidents.  This controversial move led to a full-page advertisement in the [[Wall Street Journal]] on March 31, 2005.  The advertisement featured opposition to the company leadership by a group of dissidents known as the "Group of Eight".  Several distinguished executives later left the firm amid speculation that they disagreed with the new management structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2009-04-06/was-purcell-right-about-morgan-stanley-after-all-1 Was Purcell right about Morgan Stanley after all?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Phil Purcell announced his retirement on June 13, 2005, and [[John J. Mack]] was named successor. On July 11, 2005, Stephen S. Crawford resigned his position of Co-President "to pursue other interests".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futureofms.com/biographies.html the Group of Eight]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/business/46476/index4.html Only the men Survive]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cruz was subsequently appointed acting president.  Her lengthy position as acting president led to much speculation about the future direction of the company. This appointment may silence rumors that the position was left open as a potential merger negotiation item. In 2006, she was on the list of Forbes' 100 Most Powerful Women of the World and ranked the #10 spot.

On November 29, 2007, Morgan Stanley announced that Zoe Cruz was resigning as co-president of the firm and that she would retire immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/morgan-stanley-ousts-cruz-is-more-pain-ahead/index.html?hp The New York Times: Morgan Stanley Ousts Cruz; Is More Pain Ahead?

Gorman]].

On October 9, 2009, the New York Times reported that Zoe Cruz was possibly starting her own hedge fund named Vorás Capital Management, which is expected to focus on distressed assets and macroeconomic bets on currencies and securities&lt;ref&gt;[http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/a-hedge-fund-comeback-for-zoe-cruz/ A Hedge Fund Comeback for Zoe Cruz?

Once considered "the most powerful woman on Wall Street," in January 2014, Cruz, long dubbed "Cruz Missile", joined the Board of Anglo-South African  financial behemoth [[Old Mutual]] as an independent non-executive director.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/glass-ceiling-is-wiped-out-as-cruz-missile-hits-old-mutual-0f8n06wxjwc Costello, Miles] ''The Times'': "Glass ceiling is wiped out as Cruz missile hits Old Mutual''; 7 January 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldmutualplc.com/people/zoe-cruz.jsp Old Mutual] Old Mutual official website; accessed 10 Oct 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
Cruz was named as the highest paid woman in [[Fortune.com]] countdown with total compensation of $30 million in 2006. She was also ranked as the 16th most powerful woman in the world in 2007.
