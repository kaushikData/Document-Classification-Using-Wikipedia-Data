The '''Ahantas''' are an [[Akan people]] Ahanta is also believed to have come from the Fante word "hata" which matches with "yinda" in Ahanta language which means to dry or warm oneself after being wet or cold but geographically, the true definition of Ahanta is the land between Pra and Ankobra rivers. The stretch of land between these two rivers is how far and wide the once prosperous and flourished kingdom of the Ahantas covered.

The country of Ahanta, in what is now the [[Western Region, Ghana|Western Region]] of the [[Ghana|Republic of Ghana]], comprised a regional power in the form of a confederacy of chiefdoms which had come in early contact with the European nations settling on the Gold Coast for the purpose of trade.&lt;ref name="Dantzig2124"&gt;{{cite book | last = van Dantzig | title = Forts and castles of Ghana | pages= 21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Ahantas like their fellow Akan people migrated from the antique Akan kingdom of [[Bono state]].{{fact|date=November 2016}}

In 1656 signed the [[Treaty of Butre]] and agreed to become a [[protectorate]] of the Dutch.  This treaty lasted until 1872. This ended up being one of the longest treaties signed between an African state and a European state.  The relationship between the  Ahanta and the Dutch was at times volatile. This includes when an Nzima chief, Gyan-Kɔne seized Groot Fort Freidrichsburg. Other incidents include one in 1837 when the king of Ahanta, Baidoo Bonsoe II ([[Badu Bonsu II]]), [[Dutch-Ahanta War|rebelled against the Dutch government]], and killed several officers, including acting governor [[Hendrik Tonneboeijer|Tonneboeijer]] because of his dislike of how the Dutch operated in his region. He was later killed and had his head taken used for experiments at [[Leiden University Medical Center]] in The Netherlands. The head was returned in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7955997.stm | work=BBC News | title=Dutch to return Ghana king's head | date=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Badu Bonsu II.jpg|thumb|center|Drawing of Badu Bonsu II made by a Dutch lieutenant, 1838]]

==Culture==
The Ahanta people celebrate the Kundum festival. Kundum is  a harvest festival and involves dancing, drumming, and feasting. It was in its original state a religious festival that was used to expel evil spirits from the town.  Today, Kundum is celebrated as a way to preserve the culture of the Ahanta people and neighboring [[Nzema people|Nzema]].  The festival used to be one month long, but has been condensed to eight days.{{fact|date=November 2016}}

Ahantas practice traditional African religion, Christianity, and Islam to a lesser extent.{{fact|date=November 2016}}

'''Alfred Charles Kinsey''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|n|z|i}}; June 23, 1894 – August 25, 1956) was an American [[biologist]], professor of [[entomology]] and [[zoology]], and [[sexologist]] who in 1947 founded the Institute for Sex Research at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Learn our history |url=https://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/history/index.php |website=The Kinsey Institute |accessdate=July 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously known as the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction]]. He is best known for writing ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' (1948) and ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' (1953), also known as the [[Kinsey Reports]], as well as the [[Kinsey scale]]. Kinsey's research on [[human sexuality]], foundational to the field of [[sexology]], provoked controversy in the 1940s and 1950s. His work has influenced social and cultural values in the United States, as well as internationally.

==Early life and education==
Alfred Kinsey was born on June 23, 1894, in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], the son of Sarah Ann (née Charles) and Alfred Seguine Kinsey.&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kinsey/timeline/index.html |title=American Experience &amp;#124; Kinsey &amp;#124; Timeline |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest of three children. His mother received little formal education; his father was a professor at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]].

Kinsey's parents were poor for most of his childhood, often unable to afford proper medical care. This may have led to a young Kinsey receiving inadequate treatment for a variety of diseases including [[rickets]], [[rheumatic fever]], and [[typhoid fever]]. His health records indicate that Kinsey received suboptimal exposure to sunlight (often the cause of rickets, before milk and other foods were fortified with [[vitamin D]]) and lived in unsanitary conditions for at least part of his childhood. Rickets led to a curvature of the spine, which resulted in a slight stoop that prevented Kinsey from being [[The Draft|drafted]] in 1917 for [[World War I]].

Kinsey's parents were devout Christians. His father was known as one of the most devout members of the local [[Methodism|Methodist]] church. Most of Kinsey's social interactions were with other members of the church, often as a silent observer, while his parents discussed religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kinsey/peopleevents/p_kinsey.html |title=American Experience &amp;#124; Kinsey &amp;#124; People &amp; Events |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey's father imposed strict rules on the household, including mandating Sunday as a day of prayer and little else.

At age 10, Kinsey moved with his family to [[South Orange, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt; Also at a young age, he showed great interest in nature and camping. He worked and camped with the local [[YMCA]] throughout his early years, and enjoyed these activities to such an extent that he intended to work for the YMCA after completing his education. Kinsey's senior undergraduate thesis for psychology, a dissertation on the [[group dynamics]] of young boys, echoed this interest. He joined the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] when a troop was formed in his community. His parents strongly supported this (and joined as well) because the Boy Scouts was an organization that was based on the principles of Christianity. Kinsey worked his way up through the Scouting ranks to earn [[Eagle Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in 1913, making him one of the earliest Eagle Scouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kinsey/peopleevents/p_kinsey.html |title=Alfred Charles Kinsey (1894–1956) |accessdate=November 9, 2006 |work=American Experience: Kinsey |publisher=PBS| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061221010804/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kinsey/peopleevents/p_kinsey.html| archivedate= December 21, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite earlier disease having weakened his heart, Kinsey followed an intense sequence of difficult hikes and camping expeditions throughout his early life.

In high school, Kinsey was a quiet but hard-working student. While attending [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]], he devoted his energy to academic work and playing the piano. At one time, Kinsey had hoped to become a concert pianist, but decided to concentrate on his scientific pursuits instead. Kinsey's ability to spend immense amounts of time deeply focused on study was a trait that would serve him well in college and during his professional career. He seems not to have formed strong social relationships during high school, but earned respect for his academic ability. While there, Kinsey became interested in [[biology]], [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. Kinsey was later to claim that his high school biology teacher, Natalie Roeth, was the most important influence on his decision to become a scientist.

Kinsey approached his father with plans to study botany at college. His father demanded that he study engineering at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] instead. At Stevens, he primarily took courses related to English and engineering, but was unable to satisfy his interest in biology. Kinsey was not successful there, and decided engineering was not a field he was good at. At the end of two years at Stevens, Kinsey gathered the courage to confront his father about his interest in biology and his intent to continue studying at [[Bowdoin College]] in Brunswick, Maine, where he majored in biology.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, David E. Sexual Health: A Reference Handbook page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial research on entomology==
In the fall of 1914, Kinsey entered Bowdoin College, where he studied [[entomology]] under Manton Copeland, and was admitted to the [[Zeta Psi]] fraternity, in whose house he lived for much of his time at college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weinberg |first=Martin S. |year=1976 |title=Sex Research: Studies from the Kinsey Institute |page=25 |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gathorne-Hardy |first=Jonathan |year=2000 |title=Sex, the Measure of All Things: A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey |pages=37–38 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, IN |isbn=0-253-33734-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 Kinsey was elected to the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] society and graduated [[magna cum laude]], with degrees in [[biology]] and [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Christenson |first=Cornelia V. |year=1971 |title=Kinsey: A Biography |page=29 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, IN }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Seguine Kinsey did not attend his son's graduation ceremony from Bowdoin, possibly as another sign of disapproval of his son's choice of career and studies.

Kinsey continued his graduate studies at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Bussey Institute]], which had one of the most highly regarded biology programs in the United States. It was there that Kinsey studied applied biology under [[William Morton Wheeler]], a scientist who made outstanding contributions to [[entomology]]. Under Wheeler, Kinsey worked almost completely autonomously, which suited both men quite well.

Kinsey did his doctoral thesis on [[gall wasp]]s, zealously collecting samples of the species. He traveled widely and took 26 detailed measurements of hundreds of thousands of gall wasps; his methodology was itself an important contribution to entomology as a science. In 1919, Kinsey was awarded a [[Sc.D.]] degree by [[Harvard University]]. In 1920 he published several papers under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City, introducing the gall wasp to the scientific community and describing its [[phylogeny]]. Of the more than 18 million insects in the museum's collection, some 5 million are gall wasps collected by Kinsey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yudell |first=Michael |title=Kinsey's Other Report |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_6_108/ai_55127889 |journal=Natural History |issn=0028-0712 |date=July 1, 1999 |volume=108 |issue=6 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516101949/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_6_108/ai_55127889 |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsey wrote a widely used high-school textbook, ''An Introduction to Biology'', which was published in October 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kinsey, A Biography|first=Cornelia V.|last=Christenson|year=1971|location=Bloomington, IN |publisher=Indiana University Press|page=57|isbn=0-253-14625-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textbookhistory.com/?p=21 |title=If Kinsey’s Textbook Could Talk … |publisher=Textbook History |date=March 28, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book endorsed evolution and unified, at the introductory level, the previously separate fields of zoology and botany.
 &lt;blockquote&gt;''An Introduction to Biology'' was unlike any other textbook on the market... Kinsey's textbook was noteworthy for the strong position it took on evolution...In his textbook Kinsey laid out the basic facts of evolution in a manner-of-fact matter, as though he were discussing the life cycle of the fruit fly. ... The chapter called "Further Evidence of Change" was especially blunt...Kinsey defined evolution as "the scientific word for change", and while he acknowledged that there are some people who "think they don't believe in evolution", he tried to show his students the folly of such reasoning. To find proof of evolution, students had only to look things they used daily...Kinsey ridiculed the man who denounced evolution but owned a new breed of dog or smoked a cigar made from a recently improved variety of tobacco, saying, "When he says he doesn't believe in evolution, I wonder what he means." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones |first=James H. | title=Alfred C. Kinsey: A Life |year=2004 |location = New York| publisher=W. W. Norton and Co. | pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kinsey co-authored ''Edible Wild Plants of Eastern North America'', published in 1943, with [[Merritt Lyndon Fernald]]. The original draft of the book was written in 1919–1920, while Kinsey was still a doctoral student at the Bussey Institute, and Fernald was working at the [[Arnold Arboretum]].&lt;ref&gt;Del Tredici, Peter.

== Sexology ==

=== The Kinsey Reports ===
{{main|Kinsey Reports}}

Kinsey is widely regarded as the first major figure in American [[sexology]]; his research is cited as having paved the way for a deeper exploration into sexuality among sexologists and the general public, as well as liberating [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]].&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;{{cite book|title=Disorders of Desire: Sexuality and Gender in Modern American Sexology|isbn= 978-1592131518|publisher=[[Temple University Press]]|year=2005|pages=37–43|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&amp;pg=PA37|author=Irvine, Janice M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zastrow"&gt;{{cite book | author= Charles Zastrow|author-link=Charles Zastrow|title = Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year= 2007|pages=227–228| isbn = 0495095109 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tco4YjyZab4C&amp;pg=PT248}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Kinsey's work disputed the notions that women generally are not sexual and that female [[orgasm]]s experienced [[vagina]]lly are superior to [[Clitoris|clitoral]] orgasms.&lt;ref name="Irvine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zastrow"/&gt; He initially became interested in different forms of sexual practices in 1933, after discussing the topic extensively with a colleague, Robert Kroc. Kinsey had been studying the variations in mating practices among [[gall wasp]]s. During this time, he developed a scale measuring sexual orientation, now known as the [[Kinsey scale]], which ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 is exclusively [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and 6 is exclusively [[homosexuality|homosexual]]; a rating of X for "no socio-sexual contacts or reactions" was later added.

In 1935, Kinsey delivered a lecture to a faculty discussion group at Indiana University, his first public discussion of the topic, wherein he attacked the "widespread ignorance of sexual structure and physiology" and promoted his view that "delayed marriage" (that is, delayed sexual experience) was psychologically harmful. Kinsey obtained research funding from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], which enabled him to further study human sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, James H. Alfred C. Kinsey: A Life WW Norton New York, New York pages 441–445&lt;/ref&gt; He published ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' in 1948, followed in 1953 by ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', both of which reached the top of the bestseller lists and turned Kinsey into a celebrity. These publications later became known as the Kinsey Reports. Articles about him appeared in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'', ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', and ''[[McCall's]]''. The Kinsey Reports, which led to a storm of controversy, are regarded by many as a precursor to the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s and 1970s.

=== Controversial aspects ===
Kinsey's research went beyond theory and interview to include observation of and participation in sexual activity, sometimes involving co-workers. Kinsey justified this sexual experimentation as being necessary to gain the confidence of his research subjects. He encouraged his staff to do likewise, and to engage in a wide range of sexual activity, to the extent that they felt comfortable; he argued that this would help his interviewers understand the participants' responses.&lt;ref name="Vern1"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Vern L.|last=Bullough|title=Book Review "Alfred C.

Jones, author of ''Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life'', and British psychiatrist [[Theodore Dalrymple]], among others, have speculated that Kinsey was driven by his own sexual needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=James H.|title=Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life|year=1997|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-04086-0|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the data published in the two ''Kinsey Reports'' books is controversial in the scientific and psychiatric communities, due to Kinsey's decision to interview volunteers who may not have been representative of the general population.&lt;ref name="Boothe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/50-years-after-the-kinsey-report/|title=50 Years After The Kinsey Report|author=Boothe Cosgrove-Mather|publisher=Associated Press, CBS News|date=January 27, 2003|accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  University of Chicago sociology professor [[Edward Laumann]] also argued that Kinsey's work was focused on the biology of sex and lacked psychological and clinical information and analysis.&lt;ref name="Boothe" /&gt;

Kinsey collected sexual material from around the world, which brought him to the attention of U.S. Customs when they seized some pornographic films in 1956; he died before this matter was resolved legally.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; Kinsey wrote about pre-adolescent orgasms using data in tables 30 to 34 of the male volume, which report observations of orgasms in over three-hundred children aged from two months up to fifteen years.&lt;ref name="kinsey-tables"&gt;{{cite book|title= Sexual Behavior in the Human Male  |last= Kinsey|first= Alfred Charles|author2=Clyde Eugene Mart|year= 1998 |origyear=1948|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=178–180 |isbn= 0-253-33412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information was said to have come from adults' childhood memories, or from parent or teacher observation.&lt;ref name="kinsey-inst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/controversy%202.htm |title=Kinsey Institute statement denies child abuse in study |publisher=Kinseyinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123084849/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/controversy%202.htm |archivedate=January 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey said he also interviewed nine men who had sexual experiences with children, and who told him about the children's responses and reactions.

Jones wrote that Kinsey's sexual activity influenced his work, that he over-represented prisoners and prostitutes, classified some single people as "married",&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, James H.

Their first son, Donald, born in 1922, died from the acute complications of [[juvenile diabetes]] in 1927, just before his fifth birthday. Their first daughter, Anne, was born in 1924, followed by Joan in 1925, and then by their second son Bruce in 1928.

Kinsey designed his own house, which was built in the [[Vinegar Hill Historic District|Vinegar Hill]] neighborhood of Bloomington, Indiana, at 1320 First Street. There he practiced his deep interest in [[gardening]].&lt;ref&gt;Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory.  ''City of Bloomington Interim Report''.

Kinsey died on August 25, 1956, at the age of 62. The cause of his death was reported to be a heart ailment and [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name = "APobit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/kinsey.html|title=Dr. Kinsey is Dead; Sex Researcher, 62|work=New York Times|date=August 26, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' ran the following editorial on August 27, 1956:

{{quote|The untimely death of Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey takes from the American scene an important and valuable, as well as controversial, figure. Whatever may have been the reaction to his findings—and to the unscrupulous use of some of them—the fact remains that he was first, last, and always a scientist. In the long run it is probable that the values of his contribution to contemporary thought will lie much less in what he found out than in the method he used and his way of applying it. Any sort of scientific approach to the problems of sex is difficult because the field is so deeply overlaid with such things as moral precept, taboo, individual and group training, and long established behavior patterns. Some of these may be good in themselves, but they are no help to the scientific and empirical method of getting at the truth. Dr. Kinsey cut through this overlay with detachment and precision. His work was conscientious and comprehensive. Naturally, it will receive a serious setback with his death. Let us earnestly hope that the scientific spirit that inspired it will not be similarly impaired.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Pomeroy (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "New York Times editorial"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/08/27/archives/dr-kinsey.html?ref=alfredckinsey|title=Dr. Kinsey|work=New York Times|date=August 27, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
The popularity of ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' prompted widespread media interest in 1948. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine declared, "Not since ''Gone With the Wind'' had booksellers seen anything like it."&lt;ref name="Time1"&gt;{{cite news|date=March 1, 1948 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794270,00.html |title=How to Stop Gin Rummy |work=Time |accessdate=September 11, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017155052/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C794270%2C00.html |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A character called "Dr. Kinsey" appeared on the September 15, 1953 television episode of ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' as a bow-tied man interviewing a young woman on board a [[cruise ship]] that has left [[Hawaii]].  When "Dr. Kinsey" identifies himself to [[Jack Benny]], Benny steps away in embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jack Benny Show from September 15, 1953|url=https://archive.org/details/Jack_Benny_09_15_1953|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first pop culture references to Kinsey appeared not long after the book's publication; [[Martha Raye]] [sold] a half-million copies of 'Ooh, Dr. Kinsey!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = December 12, 2004 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/arts/12rich.html?ex=1260334800&amp;en=0297f1d1dff963fa&amp;ei=5088| title = The Plot Against Sex in America| work = New York Times | accessdate = September 11, 2007 | first=Frank | last=Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cole Porter]]'s song "[[Too Darn Hot]]", from the Tony Award–winning Broadway musical ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'', devoted its bridge to an analysis of the Kinsey report and the "average man's favorite sport." In 1949 [[Mae West]], reminiscing on the days when the word "sex" was rarely uttered, said of Kinsey, "That guy merely makes it easy for me. Now I don't have to draw 'em any blueprints...We are both in the same business...Except I saw it first."&lt;ref name="Time2"&gt;{{cite news|date=March 7, 1949 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853645,00.html |title=People |work=Time |accessdate=September 11, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017155104/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C853645%2C00.html |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' prompted more intensive news coverage: Kinsey appeared on the cover of the August 24, 1953, issue of ''Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19530824,00.html |title=TIME Magazine Cover: Dr. Alfred C.

(1990). ''The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex''. New York: St. Martin's. {{ISBN|0-312-05268-5}}. p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; The lead article concluded with the following observation: "'Kinsey ... has done for sex what Columbus did for geography,' declared a pair of enthusiasts ... forgetting that Columbus did not know where he was when he got there.... Kinsey's work contains much that is valuable, but it must not be mistaken for the last word."&lt;ref name="Time3"/&gt;  That same year, Kinsey appeared as a character in an episode of the Jack Benny TV program (September 15, 1953), in which he and his research were written into a sketch about Benny's 'fantasy' about [[Marilyn Monroe]], a guest on the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jack Benny Show from September 15, 1953|url=https://archive.org/details/Jack_Benny_09_15_1953 |publisher=Archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 2000s saw a renewed interest in Kinsey. In 2003 [[Theatre of NOTE]] produced the Steve Morgan Haskell play titled ''Fucking Wasps'' which followed Kinsey's life from childhood until death.  Matt Sesow's paintings adorned the theater along with David Bickford playing piano live.  Written and directed by Steve Morgan Haskell,  ''Fucking Wasps'' received many accolades, including a Playwriting of the Year nomination from Backstage West.  Premiering in 2003, the musical ''Dr. Sex'' focuses on the relationship between Kinsey, his wife, and their shared lover Wally Matthews (based on [[Clyde Martin]]). The play had a score by Larry Bortniker, a book by Bortniker and Sally Deering, and won seven [[Joseph Jefferson Awards|Jeff Awards]]. It was produced off-Broadway in 2005. The 2004 [[biographical film]] ''[[Kinsey (film)|Kinsey]]'', written and directed by [[Bill Condon]], stars [[Liam Neeson]] as the scientist and [[Laura Linney]] as his wife. In 2004 [[T. Coraghessan Boyle]]'s novel about Kinsey, ''[[The Inner Circle (novel)|The Inner Circle]]'', was published. The following year, [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] produced the documentary ''Kinsey'' in cooperation with the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]], which allowed access to many of its files. ''Mr. Sex'', a [[BBC]] radio play by Steve Coombes concerning Kinsey and his work, won the 2005 Imison Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/imison2005.html| title =Imison Award 2005| publisher= Society of Authors| accessdate = September 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Kinsey was inducted into the [[Legacy Walk]] in Chicago, an outdoor public display which celebrates [[LGBT]] history and people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacyprojectchicago.org/2012_INDUCTEES.html 2012 INDUCTEES]. Legacyprojectchicago.org (June 2, 2013). Retrieved on 2015-06-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anesthesia awareness''', also referred to as '''accidental awareness during general anaesthesia''' ('''AAGA''') or '''unintended intra-operative awareness''', is a potential complication occurring during [[general anesthesia]] where the intended state of complete [[unconsciousness]] is not maintained throughout the whole procedure. It can occur either because of failure to deliver sufficient [[anesthetic]] medication to the patient's body or because of individual patient factors that mean the patient is resistant to what would normally be an adequate dose of anesthetic medication.

==Background==
Awareness occurs when patients have anesthesia that is inadequate to keep them unconscious during an operation. The incidence of this anesthesia complication is variable and seems to affect 0.2% to 0.4% of patients according to the surgical setting carried out. This variation reflects the surgical setting as well as the physiological state of the patient. Thus, the incidence is 0.2% in general surgery, about 0.4% during caesarean section, between 1 and 2% during cardiac surgery and between 10% and 40% for anesthesia of the traumatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Sebel PS| year = 2004| title = The incidence of awareness during anesthesia: A multicenter United States study| url =| journal = Anesth Analg| volume = 99| issue = 3| pages = 833–9| doi=10.1213/01.ane.0000130261.90896.6c| pmid=15333419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bogetz MS, Katz JA| year = 1984| title = Recall of surgery for major trauma| url =| journal = Anesthesiology| volume = 61| issue = 1| pages = 6–9| doi=10.1097/00000542-198461010-00003| pmid = 6742485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bogod D, Orton J, Oh T| year = 1990| title = Detecting awareness during general anaesthetic caesarean section| url =| journal = Anaesthesia| volume = 45| issue = 4| pages = 279–84| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.1990.tb14732.x| pmid = 2337210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dowd NP, Cheng DC, Karski JM| year = 1998| title = Intraoperative awareness in fast-track cardiac anesthesia| url =| journal = Anesthesiology| volume = 89| issue = 5| pages = 1068–73| doi=10.1097/00000542-199811000-00006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Goldmann L, Shah MV, Hebden MW| year = 1987| title = Memory of cardiac anaesthesia| url =| journal = Anaesthesia| volume = 42| issue = 6| pages = 596–603| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.1987.tb03082.x| pmid = 3618993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liu WH, Thorp TA, Graham SG| year = 1991| title = Incidence of awareness with recall during general anaesthesia| url =| journal = Anaesthesia| volume = 46| issue = 6| pages = 435–7| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.1991.tb11677.x| pmid = 2048657|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons G, Macdonald R.

The incidence is halved in the absence of neuro-muscular blockade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In this situation, the patient may feel the pain or pressure of surgery, hear conversation, experience air hunger, or have difficulty breathing. The patient may be unable to communicate any distress because they have been given a muscle relaxant; without this, they can move and the anesthesiologists are alerted and provide more anesthetic drugs to render the patient unconscious again. If anesthesia awareness does occur, about 42% feel the pain of the operation, 94% experience panic or anxiety, and 70% experience lasting symptoms which may be psychological and may be physical or neurological.&lt;ref&gt;N. Moerman et al., Anesthesiology;79:454–464, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The quoted incidences are controversial as many cases of "awareness" are open to interpretation. These usually involve feeling severe pain, clear recall of the conversations of the operating room staff or suffocation. Some patients undergo sedation for smaller procedures such as biopsies and colonoscopies and are told they will be asleep, although in fact they are getting a sedation that may allow some level of awareness as opposed to a general anesthetic.

In some cases [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) may arise after intraoperative awareness, causing the patient to require counseling for an extended period.&lt;ref name="pmid11543846"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Osterman JE, Hopper J, Heran WJ, Keane TM, van der Kolk BA|title=Awareness under anesthesia and the development of posttraumatic stress disorder|journal=Gen Hosp Psychiatry|volume=23|issue=4|pages=198–204|year=2001|pmid=11543846|doi=10.1016/S0163-8343(01)00142-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes neurological and brain injuries caused during the operation are wrongly diagnosed and described as PTSD.

==Awareness and recall==
There are two states of consciousness that may be present:
* Awareness: That is, patients seem to be cognizant responding to commands but with no postoperative recall or memory of the events.
* Awareness and recall: That is, patients can recall events postoperatively but were not necessarily conscious enough to respond to commands.
The incidence of a state with both responses in diverse degrees is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ghoneim| first = Mohamed M| title = Awareness during anesthesia| publisher = Butterworth Heinemann| year = 2001| pages = 2| isbn = 0-7506-7201-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drugs that induce paralysis would also prevent responding to commands.

==Experiences==
The most traumatic case of anesthesia awareness is full consciousness during surgery with pain and explicit recall of intraoperative events.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In less severe cases, patients may have only poor recollection of conversations, events, pain, pressure, or difficulty in breathing.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Some cases of difficulty in breathing are caused by intubation errors and/or problems with the ventilator and a patient might be suffocating.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The experiences of patients who have experienced anesthesia awareness vary widely depending on why they became aware, whether they were paralyzed and patient responses and [[sequela]]e vary widely as well. It is unusual for someone having experienced awareness without pain or suffocation to suffer bad sequelae. The experience may be extremely traumatic for the patient or not at all depending on whether they could breathe and what errors were made.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Because the medical staff may not know if a person is unconscious or not, it has been suggested that the staff maintain the professional conduct that would be appropriate for a conscious patient.&lt;ref name="pmid16801837"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gajwani P, Muzina D, Gao K, Calabrese JR|title=Awareness under anesthesia during electroconvulsive therapy treatment|journal=J ECT|volume=22|issue=2|pages=158–9|year=2006|pmid=16801837|doi= 10.1097/00124509-200606000-00018|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?an=00124509-200606000-00018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conscious sedation and monitored anesthesia care==
{{See also|Sedoanalgesia}}
There are various levels of consciousness. Wakefulness and general anesthesia are two extremes of the spectrum. Conscious sedation and monitored anesthesia care (MAC) refer to an awareness somewhere in the middle of the spectrum depending on the degree to which a patient is sedated. Awareness/wakefulness does not necessarily imply pain or discomfort. The aim of conscious sedation or monitored anesthetic care is to provide a safe and comfortable anesthetic while maintaining the patient's ability to follow commands.

Under certain circumstances, a general anesthetic, whereby the patient is completely unconscious, may be unnecessary and/or undesirable. For instance, with a cesarean delivery, the goal is to provide comfort with neuraxial anesthetic yet maintain consciousness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinical Anesthesiology|last=Morgan, Jr.|first=|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|year=|isbn=0-07-142358-3|location=|pages=291|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that the mother can participate in the birth of her child. Other circumstances may include, but are not limited to, procedures that are minimally invasive or purely diagnostic (and thus not uncomfortable). Sometimes, the patient's health may not tolerate the stress of general anesthesia. The decision to provide monitored anesthesia care versus general anesthesia can be complex involving careful consideration of individual circumstances and after discussion with the patient as to their preferences.

Patients who undergo conscious sedation or monitored anesthesia care are never meant to be without recall.&lt;ref&gt;Lekprasert, Varinee:"PreAnesthetic Assessment of the Patient Who Reports Previous Intraoperative Awareness", ''Anesthesiology News'', June 2008, pages 35–38, www.AnesthesiologyNews.com.{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not a patient remembers the procedure depends on the type of medications used, the dosages used, patient physiology, and other factors. Many patients undergoing monitored anesthesia do not remember the experience.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}

==Incidence==

The incidence of anesthesia awareness is higher and has more serious sequelae when [[muscle relaxants]] or [[neuromuscular-blocking drug]]s are used.&lt;ref name="pmid12557119"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schneider G|title=[Intraoperative awareness]|language=German|journal=Anasthesiol Intensivmed Notfallmed Schmerzther|volume=38|issue=2|pages=75–84|year=2003|pmid=12557119|doi=10.1055/s-2003-36993|url=http://www.thieme-connect.com/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2003-36993}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because without relaxant the patient will move and the anesthesiologist will deepen the anesthesia.

One study has indicated this phenomenon occurs in about 1 or 2 per 1000 patients or 0.13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15333419|year=2004|last1=Sebel|first1=PS|last2=Bowdle|first2=TA|last3=Ghoneim|first3=MM|last4=Rampil|first4=IJ|last5=Padilla|first5=RE|last6=Gan|first6=TJ|last7=Domino|first7=KB|title=The incidence of awareness during anesthesia: A multicenter United States study|volume=99|issue=3|pages=833–9, table of contents|doi=10.1213/01.ANE.0000130261.90896.6C|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is conflicting data however as another study suggested it is a rare phenomenon, with an incidence of 0.0068% after review of their data from a patient population of 211,842 patients.&lt;ref name="pmid17264720"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pollard RJ, Coyle JP, Gilbert RL, Beck JE|title=Intraoperative awareness in a regional medical system: a review of 3 years' data|journal=Anesthesiology|volume=106|issue=2|pages=269–74|year=2007|pmid=17264720|doi=10.1097/00000542-200702000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post operative interview by an anesthetist is common practice to elucidate if awareness occurred in the case. If awareness is reported a case review is immediately performed to identify machine, medication, or operator error.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Outcomes==
Patients who experience full awareness with explicit recall may have suffered an enormous trauma. Some patients experience [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), leading to long-lasting after-effects such as [[nightmare]]s, [[night terror]]s, [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], [[insomnia]], and in some cases even [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2007Apr10/0,4675,SurgerySuicide,00.html|title=Lawsuit: Wide-Awake Surgery Led to Death|last=Breen|first=Tom|date=April 10, 2007|work=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=2009-09-04|location=CHARLESTON, W.Va.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases of awareness alert the patient to intra-operative errors.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

A study from Sweden in 2002 attempted to follow up 18 patients for approximately 2 years after having been previously diagnosed with awareness under anesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lennmarken C, Bildfors K, Enlund G, Samuelsson P, Sandin R|title=Victims of awareness|journal=Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica|volume=46|issue=3|pages=229–31|year=2002|pmid=11939910|doi=10.1034/j.1399-6576.2002.t01-1-460301.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the nine interviewed patients were still severely disabled due to psychiatric/psychological after-effects. All of these patients had experienced anxiety during the period of awareness, but only one had stated feeling pain. Another three patients had less severe, transient mental symptoms, although they could cope with these in daily life. Two patients denied any lasting effects from their awareness episode.

==Risk factors/causes==

===Paralytics/muscle relaxant use===

The biggest risk factor is anaesthesia performed by unsupervised trainees and the use of a medication that induces muscle paralysis, such as [[Suxamethonium chloride|Suxamethonium]]. Under [[general anesthesia]], the patient's muscles may be paralyzed in order to facilitate tracheal intubation, surgical exposure, and because the patient cannot breathe for him or herself [[mechanical ventilation]] must be used. The paralytic agent does not cause unconsciousness or take away the patient's ability to feel pain, but it does prevent the patient from breathing so they must be ventilated correctly.

A fully paralyzed patient is unable to move, speak, blink the eyes, or otherwise respond to the pain. If neuromuscular blocking drugs are used this causes skeletal muscle paralysis and interferes with the functioning of the [[autonomic nervous system]]. The patient cannot signal their distress and they may not exhibit the signs of awareness that would be expected to be detectable by clinical vigilance.

Many types of surgery do not require the patient to be paralyzed. A patient who is anesthetized but not paralyzed can move in response to a painful stimulus if the analgesia is inadequate. This may serve as a warning sign that the anesthetic depth is inadequate. Movement under general anesthesia does not imply full awareness but is a sign that the anesthesia is light. Even without the use of paralytics the absence of movement does not necessarily imply amnesia.

===Light anesthesia===

For certain operations, such as [[Caesarean section]], or in hypovolemic patients or patients with minimal [[cardiac reserve]], the anesthesia provider may aim to provide "light anesthesia" and should discuss this with the patient to warn them. During such circumstances, consciousness and recall may occur because judgments of depth of anesthesia are not precise. The anesthesia provider must weigh the need to keep the patient safe and stable with the goal of preventing awareness. Sometimes, it is necessary to provide lighter anesthesia in order to preserve the life of the patient. "Light" anesthesia means less drugs by the intravenous route or via inhalational means, leading to less cardiovascular depression ([[hypotension]]), but causing "awareness" in the anesthetized subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lobato|first=Emilio B.|author2=Nikolaus Gravenstein|author3=Robert R. Kirby|title=Complications in anesthesiology|edition=3rd|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2007|page=57|isbn=0-7817-8263-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VVStHTKzCFkC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=anesthesia+awareness%2Bcost-cutting&amp;q=anesthesia%20awareness%2Bcost-cutting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improper equipment maintenance or anesthesiologist error===

Human errors include repeated attempts at intubation during which the short-acting anesthesic may wear off but the paralysing drug has not, oesophageal intubation, inadequate drug dose, drug given by the wrong route or wrong drug given, drugs given in the wrong sequence, inadequate monitoring, patient abandonment, disconnections and kinks in tubes from the ventilator, and failure to refill the [[anesthetic machine]]'s [[anaesthetic vaporiser|vaporizers]] with [[volatile anesthetic]]. Other causes of awareness include unfamiliarity with techniques used, e.g. intravenous anesthetic regimes, or inexperience. Most cases of awareness are caused by inexperience and poor anesthetic technique, which can be any of the above, but also includes techniques that could be described as outside the boundaries of "normal" practice. The [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] recently released a Practice Advisory outlining the steps that anesthesia professionals and hospitals should take to minimize these risks. Other societies have released their own versions of these guidelines, including the [[Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists]].&lt;ref name="titleANZCA — ANZCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anzca.edu.au/publications/profdocs/profstandards/index.htm|title=ANZCA – ANZCA|accessdate=2007-11-26|work=|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014063200/http://anzca.edu.au/publications/profdocs/profstandards/index.htm|archivedate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine malfunction or misuse may result in an inadequate delivery of anesthetic. Many Boyle's machines used in many hospitals have the oxygen regulator serving as a slave to the pressure in the nitrous oxide regulator, to enable the nitrous oxide cut-off safety feature. If nitrous oxide delivery suffers due to a leak in its regulator or tubing, an 'inadequate' mixture can be delivered to the patient, causing awareness. Many World War II vintage Boyle 'F' models are still functional and used in UK hospitals. Their emergency oxygen flush valves have a tendency to release oxygen into the breathing system, which when added to the mixture set by the anesthesiologist, can lead to awareness. This may also be caused by an empty vaporizer (or [[nitrous oxide]] [[gas cylinder|cylinder]]) or a malfunctioning intravenous pump or disconnection of its delivery tubing. Patient abandonment, when the anesthesiologist leaves, causes some cases of awareness and death.

To reduce the likelihood of awareness, anesthetists must be adequately trained and supervised while still in training. Equipment that monitors depth of anesthesia, such as [[bispectral index]] monitoring, should not be used in isolation.

===Patient physiology===
Very rare causes of awareness include drug tolerance, or a tolerance induced by the interaction of other [[medication|drugs]]. Some patients may be more resistant to the effects of anesthetics than others; factors such as younger age, obesity, tobacco smoking, or long-term use of certain drugs ([[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[opiate]]s, or [[amphetamine]]s) may increase the anesthetic dose needed to produce unconsciousness but this is often used as an excuse for poor technique.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; but this is often used as an excuse for poor technique.}} There may be genetic variations that cause differences in how quickly patients clear anesthetics, and there may be differences in how the sexes react to anesthetics as well. In addition, anesthetic requirement is increased in persons with naturally [[red hair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liem EB, Lin CM, Suleman MI|year=2004|volume=101|pages=279–283|title=Anesthetic requirement is increased in redheads|pmid=15277908|pmc=1362956|doi=10.1097/00000542-200408000-00006|issue=2|journal=Anesthesiology|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marked anxiety prior to the surgery can increase the amount of anesthesia required to prevent recall.

==Prevention==
The risk of awareness is reduced by avoidance of paralytics unless necessary; careful checking of drugs, doses and equipment; good monitoring, and careful vigilance during the case. The Isolated Forearm Technique (IFT) can be used to monitor consciousness; the technique involves applying a tourniquet to the patient's upper arm before the administration of muscle relaxants, so that the forearm can still be moved consciously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=1607133|pmid=861598|year=1977|author1=Tunstall|first1=M.

==Monitors==

Recent advances have led to the manufacture of monitors of awareness. Typically these monitor the [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], which represents the electrical activity of the [[cerebral cortex]], which is active when awake but quiescent when anesthetized (or in natural [[sleep]]). The monitors usually process the EEG signal down to a single number, where 100 corresponds to a patient who is fully alert, and zero corresponds to electrical silence. General anesthesia is usually signified by a number between 60 and 40 (this varies with the specific system used). There are several monitors now commercially available. These newer technologies include the [[bispectral index]] (BIS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Myles PS, Leslie K, McNeil J, Forbes A, Chan MT|title=Bispectral index monitoring to prevent awareness during anaesthesia: the B-Aware randomised controlled trial|journal=Lancet|volume=363|issue=9423|pages=1757–63|year=2004|url=http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(04)16300-9.pdf|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(04)16300-9|pmid=15172773}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEG [[entropy monitoring]], auditory [[evoked potentials]], and several other systems such as the SNAP monitor and the Narcotrend monitor.

None of these systems are perfect. For example, they are unreliable at extremes of age (e.g. [[neonate]]s, infants or the very elderly). Secondly, certain agents, such as [[nitrous oxide]], may produce anesthesia without reducing the value of the depth monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Clapcich AJ, Emerson RG, Roye DP, Xie H, Gallo EJ, Dowling KC, Ramnath B, Heyer EJ|title=The Effects of Propofol, Small-Dose Isoflurane, and Nitrous Oxide on Cortical Somatosensory Evoked Potential and Bispectral Index Monitoring in Adolescents Undergoing Spinal Fusion|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|volume=99|issue=5|pages=1334-contents|year=2004|pmc=2435242|pmid=15502027|doi=10.1213/01.ANE.0000134807.73615.5C}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the molecular action of these agents ([[NMDA]] receptor antagonists) differs from that of more conventional agents, and they suppress cortical EEG activity less. Thirdly, they are prone to interference from other biological potentials (such as [[Electromyography|EMG]]), or external electrical signals (such as [[electrosurgery]]). This means that the technology that will reliably monitor depth of anesthesia for every patient and every anesthetic does not yet exist.

New research has been carried out to test what people can remember after a general anesthetic in an effort to more clearly understand anesthesia awareness and help to protect patients from experiencing it. A [[memory]] is not one simple entity; it is a system of many intricate details and networks.

Memory is currently classified under two main subsections.
* First there is '''explicit''' or conscious memory,&lt;ref name="pmid17236646"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sandin R|title=Outcome after awareness with explicit recall|journal=Acta Anaesthesiol Belg|volume=57|issue=4|pages=429–32|year=2006|pmid=17236646|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the conscious recollection of previous experiences. An example of explicit memory is remembering what you did last weekend. When it comes to an anesthetized patient, a doctor may ask the patient after undergoing general anesthesia if he or she could remember hearing any distinct sounds or words while under anesthesia. This approach is called a "recall test" because patients are asked to recall any memories they had during surgery.
* The second main type of memory is '''implicit''' memory or unconscious memory, which refers to the changes in performance or behavior that are produced by previous experiences but without any conscious recollection of those experiences. An example of this is a recognition test, where patients are asked to determine, after surgery, which of a selection of words could be heard to during the surgery. The following scenario is an example. Patients were exposed during anesthesia to a list of words containing the word "pension". Postoperatively, when they were presented with the three-letter word stem PEN___ and were asked to supply the first word that came to their minds beginning with those letters, they gave the word "pension" more often than "pencil" or "peninsula" or others.&lt;ref name="pmid10691248"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ghoneim MM|title=Awareness during anesthesia|journal=Anesthesiology|volume=92|issue=2|pages=597–602|year=2000|pmid=10691248|doi=10.1097/00000542-200002000-00043|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0003-3022&amp;volume=92&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=597|last2=Weiskopf|first2=Richard B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers are now formally interviewing patients postoperatively to calculate the incidence of anesthesia awareness. It is good practice for the anesthesiologist to visit the patient after the operation and check that the patient was not aware. Most patients who were not unduly disturbed by their experiences do not necessarily report cases of awareness unless directly asked. Many who are greatly disturbed report their awareness but anesthesiologists and hospitals deny it has happened. It has been found that some patients may not recall experiencing awareness until one to two weeks after undergoing surgery. It was also found that some patients require a more detailed interview to jog their memories for intraoperative experiences but these are only untraumatic cases. Some researchers have found that while anesthesia awareness does not commonly occur in minor surgeries, it may occur more frequently in more serious surgeries, and that it is good practice to warn of the possibility of awareness in those cases where it may be more likely.

==Cognitive psychologists study memory under anesthesia==

A number of mainstream cognitive psychologists have studied memory as a basic cognitive process under anesthesia.

John F. Kihlstrom of the University of California, Berkeley is a cognitive psychologist and has contributed to a book on consciousness with a chapter on anesthesia.&lt;ref name="titleAnesthesia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~kihlstrm/Anesthesia2007.htm|title=Anesthesia (2007)|accessdate=2010-05-29|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chantal Kerssens of Emory University in Atlanta was trained as a cognitive psychologist. Her research interests have been in memory function during anesthesia, in particular its relation to depth of sedation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.emory.edu/faculty/profile_cv.cfm?id=7176|title=Emory University - Leading Research University in Atlanta, GA|author=|date=|website=www.med.emory.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; She can be observed in a video lecture whose topic is: Neuroimaging Anesthetic Effect on Brain Networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videos.med.wisc.edu/presenter.php?speakerid=1574|title=Chantal  Kerssens PhD - SMPH Video Library|author=|date=|website=videos.med.wisc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackie Andrade of the Applied Psychology Group at University of Plymouth, U.K. has a special interest in "Priming and awareness during anaesthesia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/jandrade|title=Professor Jackie Andrade - University of Plymouth|author=|date=|website=www.plymouth.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written an article, "Unconscious memory formation during anaesthesia".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130119085552/http://www.clinicalanaesthesiology.com/article/S1521-6896(07)00039-0/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television work==

Lee's first major acting role was the BBC's 1957 television production of the opera ''[[Madame Butterfly]]'' as Suzuki, although the actors' singing was dubbed by professionals.&lt;ref name=Baxter280757&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baxter|first1=Ronald|title=I will make good (said Barbara) - and she has|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19570728-1.2.69|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=28 July 1957|page=9|via=NewspapersSG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ambassador's Wife as Stage Adviser|work=[[The Times]]|date=4 July 1957|location=London|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 she had a co-starring role with [[Jeffrey Hunter]] in the [[Hong Kong]]-shot film ''[[Strange Portrait]]''. She played a ballerina and girlfriend of the main character played by Hunter.&lt;ref name=Yeoh&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yeoh|first1=Olivia|title=Her career is all important|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19660201-1.2.99.1?ST=1&amp;AT=search&amp;k=%22barbara%20yu%20ling%22&amp;QT=%22barbarayuling%22&amp;oref=article|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=1 February 1966|page=8|via=NewspaperSG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was never released and is now believed lost.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; According to director [[Jeffrey Stone]], the film was suppressed by the Hong Kong censors because of a scene in which Lee appeared partially nude.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=Jeffrey|title=Whatever Happened to Prince Charming?|date=2010|isbn=9781450546331|pages=195–199|authorlink=Jeffrey Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 she had her most prominent film role, as cult leader Chin Yang in ''[[Count Dracula and His Vampire Bride]]''. Author Paul Meehan commented that stars [[Christopher Lee]] and [[Peter Cushing]] were "ably assisted by the quirky portrayals of [[Freddie Jones]] and Barbara Yu Ling in supporting roles."&lt;ref name="Meehan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meehan|first1=Paul|title=The Vampire in Science Fiction Film and Literature|date=2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786474875|pages=146–148|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfDpAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Barbara%20Yu%20Ling&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heinrich Zille Konsum-Genossenschaft.jpg|thumb|''Konsum-Genossenschaft'', watercolor by [[Heinrich Zille]], 1924]]

'''Berlinerisch''' or '''Berlinisch''' is a dialect of [[German language|German]]. It is not a dialect linguistically{{huh?|date=January 2018}}, but similar to [[Lausitzisch-neumärkisch dialects|Lausitzisch-neumärkisch]] and spoken in [[Berlin]] as well as the [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|surrounding metropolitan area]]. It originates from a [[Brandenburgisch dialect|Brandenburgish variant]]. However, several phrases in '''Berlinisch''' are typical of and unique to the city, indicating the manifold origins of immigrants, among them the [[Huguenot]]s from [[France]].

==Overview==
The area of Berlin was one of the first to abandon [[East Low German]] as a written language (in the 16th century) and later also as a spoken language. This was the first [[dialect]] of [[German language|Standard German]] with definite [[High German]] roots but a [[Low German]] [[substratum]] apparently formed (''Berlinerisch'' may therefore be considered an early form of ''[[Missingsch]]''). Only recently has this new dialect expanded into the surroundings which until then used East Low German.

Since the 20th century, Berlinerisch has been a colloquial standard in the surrounding Brandenburg region. However, in Berlin proper, especially in the former [[West Berlin]], the dialect is now seen more as a [[sociolect]], largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak [[standard German]] in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/de/deutsch-lernen/berlinerisch/s-12462 Berlinerisch], [[Deutsche Welle]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, the dialect is found on advertising.

==Phonology==
Berlinerisch pronunciation is similar to that of other High German varieties. Nevertheless, it maintains unique characteristics that set it apart from other variants. Most notable are the strong contraction trends over several words and the rather irreverent adaptation of foreign words and [[Anglicism]]s that are difficult to understand among Upper German speakers. Also, the letter g is pronounced as a y-sound ([j]). This is exemplified in the word for good, in which ''gut'' becomes ''jut''.

==Grammar==
Berlinisch grammar contains some notable differences from that of [[standard German]]. For instance, the [[accusative case]] and [[dative case]] are not distinguished. Similarly, conjunctions that are distinguished in standard German are not in Berlinisch. For example, in standard German, ''wenn'' (when / if) is used for conditional, theoretical, or consistent events and ''wann'' (when) is used for an events currently occurring or questions. There is no difference between the two in Berlinisch.&lt;ref&gt;''Icke, icke bin Berlina, wer mir haut, den hau ich wieda'' [http://www.zfs.uni-freiburg.de/zfs/arbeiten/ws-07-08-journ-grundl-recherche-und-interview-neubauer/berlindialekt_artikel_woelke Wölke] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205121214/http://www.zfs.uni-freiburg.de/zfs/arbeiten/ws-07-08-journ-grundl-recherche-und-interview-neubauer/berlindialekt_artikel_woelke |date=December 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genitive forms are also replaced by prepositional accusative forms, some still with an inserted pronoun. For example, ''dem sein Haus'' (the his house) rather than the standard ''sein Haus'' (his house). Plural forms often add an additional -s, regardless of the standard plural ending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.snafu.de/mat/karte_viertel_sieben.gif Viertel-Dreiviertel-Verbreitungskarte]&lt;/ref&gt;

Words ending in ''-ken'' are often written (colloquially) and pronounced as ''-sken''.

The '''British Red Cross Society''' is the [[United Kingdom]] body of the worldwide neutral and impartial humanitarian network the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]]. The society was formed in 1870, and is a registered charity with more than 32,500 volunteers and 3,500 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|220949|The British Red Cross Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=British Red Cross|title=Introducing the British Red Cross|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/~/media/BritishRedCross/Documents/About%20us/GC_Intro_BRC_2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the heart of their work is providing help to people in crisis, both in the UK and overseas. The Red Cross is committed to helping people without discrimination, regardless of their ethnic origin, nationality, political beliefs or religion.[http://www.redcross.org.uk/About-us/Who-we-are/The-international-Movement/Fundamental-principles]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Guiding Ethos ==
The mission of the British Red Cross  is to mobilise the power of humanity so that individuals and communities can prepare for, deal with and recover from a crisis, summed up by the strapline 'refusing to ignore people in crisis'. In fulfilling this mission, all volunteers and staff must abide by the seven fundamental principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which are:
* [[Compassion|Humanity]]
* [[Impartiality]]
* [[Neutrality (international relations)|Neutrality]]
* [[Independence]]
* [[Volunteering|Voluntary Service]]
* [[Cooperation|Unity]]
* [[universality (philosophy)|Universality]]
The British Red Cross also has four values,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/About-us/Who-we-are/Our-values |title=Our values &amp;#124; British Red Cross |publisher=Redcross.org.uk |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which guide the way they work. These are:	
* Compassionate
* Inclusive
* Dynamic
* Courageous

==History==

===Formation===
The British Red Cross was formed in 1870, just seven years after the formation of the international movement in Switzerland. This followed the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871), and a move across Europe to form similar societies. On 4 August 1870, after a public meeting, the ''''British National Society for Aid to the Sick and Wounded in War'''' was formed. It assisted in providing aid to both warring armies in the Franco-Prussian War and subsequent 19th-century conflicts, under the protection of the Red Cross Emblem.

In 1905, 35 years after its formation, the society was reconstituted as the British Red Cross Society, and was granted its first Royal Charter in 1908 by King [[Edward VII]]. His consort, [[Queen Alexandra]], became its president.

===First World War===
Following the start of the [[Great War]] in 1914, the British Red Cross joined forces with the Order of St. John Ambulance to form the Joint War committee and [[Joint War Organisation]]. They pooled resources and formed [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]]s (or VADs) with members trained in First Aid, Nursing, Cookery, Hygiene and Sanitation. These detachments all worked under the protection of the Red Cross, working in hospitals, rest stations, work parties and supply centres.

The [[Joint War Organisation]] also provided assistance at the front line, supplying the first motorised ambulances to the battlefields, which were significantly more efficient then the horse-drawn ambulances they replaced.

The [[Joint War Organisation]] was also active in setting up centres for recording the wounded and missing. Red Cross volunteers searched towns, villages and hospitals where fighting had occurred, noting names of the missing, the injured and the dead. This formed the basis of the international Message and Tracing service, still running today.

Amongst the more innovative activities of the Red Cross in the war was the training of [[Airedale Terrier]] dogs to search for wounded soldiers on battlefields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/scotland-now/scotlands-dogs-war-commemorated-pink-10363625 |title=Scotland's dogs of war to be commemorated with a pink granite statue on Angus beach |newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)]] |location=[[Glasgow]] |publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] |date=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-war years===

He stands side on and holds a wooden [[barge pole]] in his right hand. He appears to be standing on the deck of a boat, with the [[River Tigris]] and buildings on the riverbank visible behind him, 1919]]

In 1919, after the cessation of hostilities, the League of the Red Cross (now the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies) was formed, and the role of national societies increased, with a shift of emphasis from wartime relief to focusing on "the improvement of health, the prevention of disease and mitigation of suffering throughout the world".  
The British Red Cross stayed involved with blood transfusion past the formation of the [[National Blood Service]] and it retained an ancillary role until 1987.

The British Red Cross was instrumental in starting overseas societies through the Empire and Commonwealth, most of which are now independent national societies. 

In 1924, the British Red Cross started its youth movement, helping to promote its values to a younger generation.

===Second World War===
[[File:Red Cross Parcel.jpg|right|thumb|British Red Cross parcel]]

After the declaration of war in 1939, the British Red Cross once again joined with St. John to form the [[Joint War Organisation]], again affording the St. John volunteers protection under the Red Cross emblem.

The organisation once again worked in hospitals, care home, nurseries, ambulance units, rest stations and more, much of which was funded by the Duke of Gloucester's Red Cross and St John appeal, which had raised over £54&amp;nbsp;million by 1946.

The Red Cross also famously arranged [[Red Cross parcel|parcels]] for prisoners of war, following the provisions of the third Geneva convention in 1929, which laid out strict rules for the treatment of PoWs. The Joint War Organisation sent standard food parcels, invalid food parcels, medical supplies, educational books and recreational materials to prisoners of war worldwide. During the conflict, over 20 million standard food parcels were sent.

The only part of the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|British Isles occupied by Germany]], the [[Channel Islands]], were helped avoid starvation with [[Red Cross parcel|food parcels]] brought by the Red Cross ship [[SS Vega (1913)|SS Vega]].

===Post war years===
The immediate priorities for the British Red Cross following the war, were the huge number of displaced civilians caused by forced migration during the war. The Red Cross provided much relief for these people, including basic supplies, and helping to reunite people through the Messaging and Tracing Service. This work led to the provisions in the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians caught up in war.

Since then, the British Red Cross has provided relief to people worldwide, including during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], in Vietnam in 1976, Famine in Africa in the 1980s and the [[1999 Armenia, Colombia earthquake]]. Whilst the society no longer sends its volunteers abroad, it is a leading contributor of delegates to the international red cross pool of emergency relief workers.

Between 1948 and 1967 the British Red Cross and the [[St Andrew's Ambulance Association]] jointly operated the [[Scottish Ambulance Service]], under contract to the National Health Service. [[NHS Scotland]] took over full responsibility for the service in 1974.

In the UK, the society has been active at many major disasters, from the coal tip slide at [[Aberfan]] in 1966, the [[Lockerbie]] air disaster in 1988 to the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]] in 2005, providing support on all levels, from front line medical provision, to running helplines for worried relatives and long term emotional care for the victims.

In July 2008, the society celebrated the 100th anniversary of the granting of the Royal Charter with a garden party at [[Buckingham Palace]]. The party was hosted by TRH The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.

==Status and Structure==
The British Red Cross is recognised by the [[UK Government]] as one of three Voluntary Aid Societies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=British Red Cross|year=2007|title=Royal Charter of the British Red Cross. Article 3.|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/uploads/documents/HR_FIN_RoyalCharter.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201190906/http://www.redcross.org.uk/uploads/documents/HR_FIN_RoyalCharter.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the other two being [[St John Ambulance]] and [[St Andrew's Ambulance Association]]. It is the sole Red Cross Society for the United Kingdom and the [[British Overseas Territories]]. The organisation is divided into three regions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/Where-we-work/In-the-UK|title=In the UK|work=redcross.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; then into operational areas, and then further into 'branches', which in most cases represent an administrative county. Services provided by the British Red Cross are thus able to be adapted, depending on the circumstances and needs of the local area.

The British Red Cross, as with all IFRC member societies, operate first and foremost an '''Emergency Response''' service, which supports the statutory and governmental [[Emergency service]]s in times of crisis, in accordance with the duty of Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies to be auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments.

The British Red Cross provides a wide range of services to assist the emergency services and statutory authorities, ranging from first aid support and distribution of aid during a crisis to managing a disaster appeal scheme and providing telephone support lines in its aftermath. Notably, all services of the British Red Cross can be utilised for the emergency response service, as the situation demands. For example, the therapeutic care service can provide support at a rest centre for survivors, while Ambulances can assist the [[National Health Service|NHS]] in caring for the injured.

The emergency response service has been present at most types of major emergency such as the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]], [[Manchester Arena bombing]], [[Grenfell Tower fire]], rail crashes, other fires, and floods. The British Red Cross operate this service throughout its territory, available 24 hours a day but, contrary to popular belief, does not send its volunteers abroad, as overseas disasters will be dealt with by the society in the country affected.

In addition to this core service, the British Red Cross operates in other areas, both at home and abroad as part of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] to help people in crisis:

===First aid and ambulance provision===
[[File:Rx ambulance.png|thumb|left|British Red Cross ambulance]]
The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is the largest provider of first aid in the world. The British Red Cross is possibly most recognised in the UK for its work as a leading provider of [[first aid]] at public events across the UK. Thousands of volunteers give care to the injured at events of all sizes including Premiership football games, concerts and large-scale running events such as the [[Race for Life]] and the [[Great North Run]].

The training undertaken by Event First Aid Service volunteers varies, and advanced training is available to those volunteers who wish to undertake it, which includes rising to the level of [[Ambulance]] Crew, or even undertaking training to become a fully qualified [[Ambulance technician]]. The British Red Cross employ Paramedics but do not train them in-house. These ambulance crews undergo national standard training and examination and are then qualified to offer an advanced level of care to sick and injured patients. The training is of a sufficiently high standard, that in many areas, along with the other main medical service provider, [[St. John Ambulance]], British Red Cross ambulance crews work on behalf of the [[National Health Service|NHS]] [[Emergency medical services in the United Kingdom|Ambulance Service]] during particularly busy times or whenever requested, responding to 999 calls from members of the public. Areas with regular British Red Cross ambulance support include the [[North East Ambulance Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neas.nhs.uk/about-us/who-we-are-and-what-we-do.aspx|title=Who we are and what we do - North East Ambulance Service - NHS Foundation Trust|website=www.neas.nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[South East Coast Ambulance Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jobs.redcross.org.uk/tlive1_webrecruitment/wrd/run/ETREC107GF.open?VACANCY_ID%3D451800ES1G%1BU&amp;WVID=624080007l&amp;LANG=USA|title=Role title Ambulance Crew Trainee (SECAmb)|last=|first=|date=|website=British Red Cross|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialist units exist within the first aid provision including the Cycle Response Unit, which allows trained cyclists with enhanced first aid skills to access areas inaccessible to full ambulance vehicles. This was initially sponsored by [[Land Rover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.landrover.com/news/2011/08/land-rover-funds-26-cycle-response-units-british-red-cross|title=media.landrover.com/news/2011/08/land-rover-funds-26-cycle-response-units-british-red-cross|website=media.landrover.com|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First aid training===
The British Red Cross is one of the leading providers of first aid training in the United Kingdom. It trains people both on a community and commercial basis. The commercial training teams run nationally recognised First aid courses specifically designed to provide skills for use at work. The British Red Cross have been running these courses for 25 years and over 120,000 people are trained each year. Courses range from a basic Emergency Life Support to a three-day First Aid at Work (FAW) course recognised by the [[Health and Safety Executive]].

On a community basis, the British Red Cross also is well known as providing many first aid courses across the country to members of the public, as well as reaching out to schools, community groups and minority groups. One of the projects of the British Red Cross is ''[http://www.redcross.org.uk/en/What-we-do/First-aid/Everyday-First-Aid Everyday First Aid]'', which seeks to provide training to those who would not otherwise get the opportunity to undertake such training, such as people with disabilities.

First aid training programmes delivered by the Red Cross are renowned for giving participants both the skills and confidence to use what they have learnt, with a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical sessions.

===Fire and emergency support===
Formerly known as Fire Victim Support, this service is one of the more recent to be started by the British Red Cross. Covering most, but not yet all, of the UK, the British Red Cross provide assistance at the request of the local Fire and Rescue Service to those in the immediate aftermath of emergencies such as a house fire or road traffic accident. Typically a team of two volunteers with a customised vehicle will respond to victims and provide them with shelter, food, first aid, clothing, toiletries, washing facilities and moral support. Volunteers will assist with the process of dealing with local authority housing departments or insurance companies to enable rehousing.

In addition, these teams are frequently called out to major incidents to provide support to the firefighters and other emergency services, from simply making refreshments available, to providing a confidential listening service for those members of the emergency services traumatised by what they have just seen.

They also are key in many Local Authorities' emergency plans and may be given the role of helping at or running Survivor reception centres, setting up Friends and Family reception centres and providing first aid at them, and sometimes the providing first aid at the incident site (such as during the London bombings on 7/7) – thus freeing up more highly trained Paramedics. The Red Cross also are able to set up a number of help lines in connection with major incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/dealing-with-emergencies/support-after-a-major-incident/role-of-police-casualty-bureau-and-local-authorities-in-major-incidents.htm|title=Role of police, casualty bureau and district councils in major incidents|work=nidirect.gov.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221154536/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/dealing-with-emergencies/support-after-a-major-incident/role-of-police-casualty-bureau-and-local-authorities-in-major-incidents.htm|archivedate=21 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiltshire.police.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=258&amp;Itemid=587 |title=Survivor Reception Centre |publisher=Wiltshire.police.uk |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/What-we-do/Emergency-response/UK-emergency-response |title=Emergency response in the UK &amp;#124; British Red Cross |publisher=Redcross.org.uk |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical Equipment Loan===
British Red Cross provides the public alongside some Hospital trusts to borrow a wheelchair for free. This operates throughout United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland. They nearly have 1,000 different offices that operate this service. This service is operated by the British Red Cross Health and Social Department.

===Humanitarian education===
This service provides a way of learning about and understanding the world – best thought of as a form of citizenship education. It is not religious or political, but is centrally concerned with our shared humanity. At the core of humanitarian action and thinking is a desire to contribute to saving lives and reducing suffering. Humanitarian education invites exploration of those actions and thoughts. Humanitarian Education helps students examine what motivates people, including themselves, and extends to other societies, times and cultures. It explores the wider issues, sometimes surprisingly complex, that arise when people help each other.

The British Red Cross provides educational resources for teachers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/education|title=Citizenship and PSHE lesson plans, activities and ideas for teachers|work=redcross.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and trained peer education volunteers. In September 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News |title=Internet game for victims of war|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7638581.stm | date=29 September 2008 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the British Red Cross launched an [[alternate reality game]] called  Traces of Hope&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tracesofhope.com|title=Protecting people in conflict – British Red Cross|work=tracesofhope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help educate people about the work the [[Red Cross]] does in conflict areas and the effect war has on civilians.

===Health and social care===
'''Care in the Home'''&lt;br /&gt;
The British Red Cross, in some areas, provides short-term care and support for people recently returned from hospital, or recently having suffered an injury which otherwise would result in a hospital or care facility admission. Volunteers enter peoples' homes and help them with the every day tasks which would otherwise be impossible or pose difficulty for them, such as shopping and getting prescriptions, helping them maintain their independence and dignity, while preparing them for living independently and offering companionship.

There is small Red Cross team working in the discharge lounge in A&amp;E at [[Leighton Hospital]] who use their own cars to drive vulnerable patients home and settle them in.  The following day they make a follow up – a phone call. If all is well, great. If not, they can refer on to the BRC’s Home from Hospital scheme that provides up to six weeks social support such as help with shopping and befriending. This is one of 26 similar services. There are 86 Home from Hospital services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Integration supplement: How the third sector helps discharged patients|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/resource-centre/supplements/integration-supplement-how-the-third-sector-helps-discharged-patients/5083793.article#.VUZvQ6k2MYA|accessdate=3 May 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While referrals for this service can come from health and social care professionals, people can also self-refer.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Therapeutic care'''&lt;br /&gt;
British Red Cross volunteers in the Therapeutic Care Service are also active in hospitals and other care settings, such as care homes, where they enter and give patients a therapeutic massage of the head, neck, shoulders and hands through the patient's clothing, to help relax them, particularly at stressful times, and encourage a sense of wellbeing. Referrals for this service usually come from [[healthcare professionals]], but people can self-refer, as the service can also be provided at community meeting places and homes.

'''Crisis intervention community support service'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Crisis intervention community support service which operates in [[Derbyshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]] and [[Cheshire]] provides crisis emotional support and assists people in maintaining their independent living skills during a period of crisis.  It helps to prevent admission to hospital or respite care by providing short, targeted interventions. The team in Nottingham  team consists of 12 healthcare assistants. During 2014 it claimed that 748 admissions were avoided, which would have cost about £1.5m.  The service costs the two local [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s just under £250,000 a year to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Social care crises require a rapid response|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/resource-centre/supplements/supplement-social-care-crises-require-a-rapid-response/5086566.article#.VaFjn6S_UYA|accessdate=11 July 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Transport Service'''&lt;br /&gt;
The British Red Cross provides a number of transport schemes to get people with limited access to transport, either with their own car or public transport, from place to place. Services can be provided by car or minibus, with an escort if appropriate, in order to help people lead a normal life, such as journeys for medical appointments and to shops. This includes in some areas 'Dial-a-Ride' schemes, where elderly or disabled people can phone and are transported by specially adapted minibus door to door.

In addition, the British Red Cross also provides, in some areas, [[ambulance]] transport, either seated or stretcher, between places of treatment, or for admissions and discharges of patients at hospital. This is operated by the trained ambulance crews also used for emergency ambulance provision.

In 2008 as part of their 60th Anniversary celebration [[land rover]] donated 60 [[freelander]] vehicles to the British Red Cross for use in the UK and around the world.

=== Refugee support services ===
Since 1989, the British Red Cross has provided a range of services to refugees, including managing a number of refugee reception centres nationwide. The work includes providing refugee orientation services and ensuring that life essentials, such as shelter and food are provided for. In cases of destitution, the British Red Cross can provide short-term emergency help, and advice on accessing other services. A peer befriending service also exists to provide help to vulnerable refugees, such as young people and women. The British Red Cross can also assist in cases of large-scale arrivals to the United Kingdom.

As of September 2008 the British Red Cross is a member of the [[European Council on Refugees and Exiles|European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE)]].

=== International family tracing ===
This is another specialised international service, operated by the majority of national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies worldwide. Started to help the refugees of war, this service now extends to any person, who has lost touch with family through war or disaster. The global Red Cross and Red Crescent network uses local volunteers to find relations, put them back in touch, or simply pass messages.

The British Red Cross also provides this service to those separated by the [[Second World War]].

This aspect hit the headlines when a volunteer famous for doing this work for 20 years was dismissed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2816610/Red-Cross-volunteer-71-axed-gay-marriage-protest-Pensioner-told-no-longer-welcome-charity-views-incompatible-values.html|title=Elderly Red Cross volunteer axed over gay marriage protest – Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International disaster relief===
Since the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is worldwide, there are volunteers in the nation affected that can provide help in disaster situations. However, the British Red Cross, in common with other national societies, sends paid personnel abroad, called ''delegates'', who have specialised skills such as in logistics, to assist the agencies in the aftermath of a major international disaster. This is in addition to resources the British Red Cross can provide, in co-operation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

The British Red Cross also provides assistance in recovery after the immediate post-disaster situation, helping prepare communities for future emergencies and facilitating long-term development.

As the largest charity of its type, it is also part of the UK [[Disasters Emergency Committee]], which is a group of large charities who fund raise for major disasters, such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Boxing day tsunami]]

===Health and care abroad===
The British Red Cross works closely with other Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to improve the health and care situation of vulnerable communities abroad.

The British Red Cross has been supporting HIV work internationally since the mid-1980s, for example in China, South Africa and Ethiopia. The charity helps combat [[Tuberculosis]] in Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia, including supporting programmes involved in raising awareness and supporting those affected in their homes. Furthermore, it supports water and [[sanitation]] activities in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Cambodia, by providing safer drinking water and sanitation facilities and educating populations.

The British Red Cross also supports programmes assisting healthcare in conflict areas, such as Iraq and Sudan.

===HIV awareness===
The British Red Cross supports the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement's mission to fight the spread of HIV and AIDS worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=British Red Cross|title=HIV – Introduction|accessdate=21 February 2008|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/hiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The society works with groups of young people to fight discrimination and stigma as well as reducing complacency about catching the disease. On [[World AIDS Day]] (1 December) 2007, the society launched an on-line campaign called "HIV: What's the story?" to target young people in the UK and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=British Red Cross|title=HIV: What's the Story?|url=http://www.redcrosshiv.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303185511/http://www.redcrosshiv.org/|archivedate=3 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign also makes extensive use of social networking sites such as Facebook and [[Bebo]].

=== Example of annual activity  ===
In 2010 the British Red Cross carried out the following activities:&lt;ref&gt;British Red Cross, Lifeline, Summer 2011, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;
* provided water, food and shelter for over 420,000 people affected by 25 overseas disasters
* trained 221,970 people in [[first aid]] (in the UK)
* provided first aid services at 9,533 public events
* responded to 2,102 emergencies in the UK
* helped 7,109 victims of fire

==Fundraising==
As a charity, the British Red Cross relies heavily on voluntary contributions from members of the public and organisations, in order to carry out its work. In addition, it does also make money from its commercial services, including First Aid Training (for the workplace), First aid provision at events and providing auxiliary crews to the ambulance services.

Whilst personal donations are important, the scale of corporate donations can make a huge difference to the society, and initiatives such as being the [[Tesco]] charity of the year in 2007 make large contributions to central funds.

Every year, many events are held, including sponsored bike rides, walks and even skydives. Red Cross Appeal Week (formerly known as Red Cross Flag Week), is held annually in May, to coincide with the birthday of Red Cross founder, [[Henry Dunant]]. This is a week where staff and volunteers are asked to donate two hours to run street and private premises collections.

The British Red Cross helps to fund, and is aided with funds raised by, the national will-making scheme [[Will aid]], in which participating solicitors waive their usual fee to write a basic will and in exchange invite the client to donate to charity.&lt;ref name="Will Aid"&gt;[http://www.willaid.org.uk/charities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420062003/http://www.willaid.org.uk/charities |date=20 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celebrity links===
In order to help boost support for the cause, the Red Cross has a number of celebrity ambassadors which include [[Angela Rippon]], [[Michael Buerk]], [[James McAvoy]], [[David Bull (doctor)|David Bull]], [[Josie d'Arby]], [[Nancy Dell'Olio]], [[Konnie Huq]], [[Craig Gannon]] and [[Dougray Scott]].

==British Red Cross Museum==
The British Red Cross runs a museum containing a variety of materials from its beginnings in 1870 to the present day. This museum is a member of [[The London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Museums|url=http://medicalmuseums.org/|website=medicalmuseums.org|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections include posters, photographs, badges worn by Society members, medals awarded to Society members, medical equipment and fundraising materials.

The collections can only be visited via a guided tour. Tours of the museum and archive collections must be booked in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/About-us/Who-we-are/Museum-and-archives/Visit-our-museum-and-archives-and-FAQs|title=Visit our museum and archives and FAQs |website=www.redcross.org.uk |publisher=British Red Cross|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
The British Red Cross sent a warning letter to the developers of the indie game '[[Prison Architect]]' in 2016. The organisation claims that, by using red cross images on ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''Prison Architect' ambulances and paramedics, the game has violated the Geneva Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/prison-architect-indie-game-violation-geneva-conventions-using-red-cross-symbol-2476595|title='Prison Architect': Indie Game In Violation Of Geneva Conventions For Using Red Cross Symbol|date=2017-01-17|newspaper=International Business Times|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3012">'''Cracovia Club''' is a [[Polish Australian]] community organisation based in [[Bennett Springs, Western Australia]].

==History==
The club was formed in 1950 at St Brigid's Parish Hall in [[Northbridge, Western Australia|Northbridge]] by members of the [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] [[Polish Australian]] community. The club was named '''Polish Sport Club Cracovia''' after the city of [[Kraków]] in [[Poland]]. It is a name shared by Polish [[Association football|football]] team [[Cracovia (football club)|Cracovia]]. The club was initially based in [[Perth, Western Australia (suburb)|Perth]] before moving to premises in Barlee Street, [[Highgate, Western Australia|Highgate]] in 1972. The club was based in Highgate until 1990 when it moved to its current location in Bennett Springs (then [[Beechboro]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northbridgehistory.wa.gov.au/index.cfm?event=document&amp;documentName=nbhdc-0421.doc|title=Polish Connection To Northbridge|last=Szunejko|first=Halina T.|date=12 May 2007|work=Northbridge History Project|publisher=Department of the Premier and Cabinet|accessdate=2009-11-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706123451/http://www.northbridgehistory.wa.gov.au/index.cfm?event=document&amp;documentName=nbhdc-0421.doc|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cracovia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cracoviaclub.com.au/cracovia/modules.php?name=History |title=History |publisher=Cracovia Club |accessdate=2009-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002081100/http://cracoviaclub.com.au/cracovia//modules.php?name=History |archivedate=October 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cracovia3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cracovia 1950-1975 - 25 Years of Cracovia Club Inc in Perth, Western Australia|publisher=Cracovia Club|date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football==
{{see|Cracovia White Eagles}}
Association football played an important early part in the club's history. Much of the club's efforts were put into ensuring success. However through the years the sporting side of the club has become less prominent with more of a focus on community activities.&lt;ref name="cracovia1" /&gt;

===Current===
The club now has a team playing in the Football West Social Division 1.&lt;ref name="cracovia2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cracoviaclub.com.au/cracovia/modules.php?name=Soccer |title=Football - Cracovia White Eagles |publisher=Cracovia Club |accessdate=2009-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002081145/http://cracoviaclub.com.au/cracovia//modules.php?name=Soccer |archivedate=October 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other sports==
A number of sports have been played competitively by the Cracovia Club including [[netball]], [[tennis]] and [[table tennis]].&lt;ref name="cracovia3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2831">[[File:Dadoba_Pandurang.jpg|thumb|Engraving from the ''Illustrated London News'', 2 December 1882]]
'''Dadoba Pandurang''' (9 May 1814 – 17 October 1882) (Pune, Maharashtra,British India) was a social reformer and linguist from Bombay. He was born with the surname '''Tarkhadkar''' but he never used it in later life. He wrote extensively on religion and social reform as an opponent of rituals and caste, while supporting widow-remarriage and education for women. He was a brother of [[Atmaram Pandurang]].

Pandurang studied at a local school for four years before going to private high school followed by studies at the Bombay Native School and Book Society. He was a recipient of a West Scholarship and studied at what became the Elphinstone and he learnt several languages including Portuguese, Persian and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=rao /&gt;

In 1830 he became a school teacher and in 1840 he moved to Surat. The headmaster at this school in Surat was Henry Green, a noted agnostic and free thinker who influenced Pandurang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Caste, Conflict and Ideology: Mahatma Jotirao Phule and Low Caste Protest in Nineteenth-Century Western India| first=Rosalind |last=O'Hanlon| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year= 2002|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1846 he served as acting superintendent of vernacular schools and in 1852 he was selected for the post of Deputy Collector and Magistrate at Ahmednagar. He moved to Thana in 1858 and retired in 1861 due to troubles with superiors. Pandurang's major contribution was a grammar of Marathi. ''Maharastra Bhasheche Vyakaran'' published in 1836 that went into seven editions during his lifetime. He also published a supplement in 1881. Other publications included ''Yashoda Pandurangi'' (1865), ''Dharam Vivechan'' (1868), ''Paramhamsik Bramhadharma'' (1880), ''[[iarchive:ahindugentleman00pandgoog|A Hindu Gentleman's Reflections respecting the works of Swedenborg]]'' (1878), ''The absurdity of the Holi Festival as it is now practised by the Hindus'' (1829), ''Shishubodh'' (posthumously published in 1884) and ''Vidhavasrumarjan'' (1857). He wrote ''Dharam Vivechan'' under the pen-name of ''Ek Jagadwasi Arya''.&lt;ref name=rao&gt;{{cite journal|title=A maker of modern Maharashtra: Dadoba Pandurang (1814-1882)| first=Vasant D. |last=Rao| journal= Proceedings of the Indian History Congress| volume=28| year=1966| pages=442–448| jstor=44140475 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pandurang taught Sanskrit briefly at the Sir Jamshedjee Jeejeebhoy Zarthosti Madresa in 1871. In 1848, he founded and presided over the ''Upayukta Jnanprasarak Sabha'', a students' literary and scientific society which met to discuss various topics every alternate Thursday.&lt;ref name=rao /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9285">'''Disconnected youth''' is a label in [[United States public policy]] debate for [[NEET]]s, young people "Not in Education, Employment, or Training". [[Measure of America]]'s March 2017 report says disconnected youth (defined as aged 16 to 24) number 4.9 million in the United States, about one in eight of the age cohort.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ssrc-static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/Promising%20Gains%20Final.pdf|title=Promising Gains, Persistent Gaps: Youth Disconnection in America|last=Lewis and Burd-Sharps|first=Kristen and Sarah|date=March 8, 2017|website=|publisher=Measure of America, Social Science Research Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disconnected youth are sometimes referred to as Opportunity Youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpsnetwork.org/advocacy/opportunity-youth|title=Opportunity Youth - The Corps Network|website=www.corpsnetwork.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emphasis is placed upon this group because the years between the late teens and the mid-twenties are believed to be a critical period during which young people form adult identities and move toward independence. The effects of youth disconnection—limited education, social exclusion, lack of work experience, and fewer opportunities to develop mentors and valuable work connections—can have long-term consequences that snowball across the life course, eventually influencing everything from earnings and self-sufficiency to physical and mental health and marital prospects. Much discussion has been focused on how to reach these young people and connect them with broader social institutions in order to prevent these negative consequences.

Analysis has also examined the economic impact of youth disconnection. According to the Measure of America report, the average disconnected youth costs $37,450 a year in government services.

== Definition ==

The term has gained increased usage in recent years among policy advocates and social science researchers, particularly after the Great Recession. After a decade of relatively stable rates, the rolls of the disconnected surged by over 800,000 young people between 2007 and 2010.&lt;ref name="OneinSeven"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis and Burd-Sharps|first=Kristen and Sarah|title=One in Seven: Ranking Youth Disconnection in the 25 Largest Metro Areas|url=http://www.measureofamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/MOA-One_in_Seven09-14.pdf|publisher=Measure of America, Social Science Research Council|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest data indicates that the rate of youth disconnection has fallen to 12.3 percent, a significant drop from the 2010 post-recession high of 14.7 percent, or 5.8 million young people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2012 study by the Annie E. Casey Foundation found that "the data show that the populations struggling the most to enter the workforce
and stay in school today are youth who are less educated, come from low-income families and belong to a racial or ethnic minority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth and Work: Restoring Teen and Young Adult Connections to Opportunity|url=http://www.aecf.org/m/resourcedoc/AECF-YouthAndWork-2012-Full.pdf|publisher=The Annie E Casey Foundation|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Education]] defines disconnected youth as those aged 14 to 24 years old, but relies on calculations done for the 16-24 group by [[Measure of America]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/03/performance-partnership-pilots-an-opportunity-to-improve-outcomes-for-disconnected-youth/&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have narrowed the definition of youth disconnection to exclude those above an income and education threshold,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/employment-and-disconnection-among-teens-and-young-adults-the-role-of-place-race-and-education/|title=Employment and disconnection among teens and young adults: The role of place, race, and education|last=Ross|first=Martha|last2=Svajlenka|first2=Nicole Prchal|date=24 May 2016|website=|publisher=The Brookings Institution|access-date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those parenting with a connected spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40535.pdf|title=Disconnected Youth: A Look at 16 to 24 Year Olds Who Are Not Working or In School|last=Fernandes-Alcantara|first=Adrienne L.|date=1 October 2015|website=|publisher=Congressional Research Service|access-date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristen-lewis/young-and-adrift-measurin_b_12125208.html|title=Young and Adrift: Measuring Youth Disconnection in America Today|last=Powers|first=Alex|last2=Recio|first2=Marina|date=26 September 2016|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=|access-date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two surveys commonly used to calculate youth disconnection are the [[American Community Survey|American Community Survey (ACS)]] and the [[Current population survey (US)|Current Population Survey (CPS)]]. Each survey has its advantages; the ACS surveys people in "group quarters" and has a larger sample size, which allows demographic and geographic disaggregation of data, while the CPS is an older survey, including data from 1940 on.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''economy of Oceania''' comprises more than 14 separate countries and their associated economies.

On a total scale the region has approximately 34,700,201&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; inhabitants who are spread among 30,000 islands {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] bordered between [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]]. This region has a diverse mix of economies from the highly developed and globally competitive financial market of [[Australia]] to the much less developed economies that belong to many of its island neighbours. [[New Zealand]] is the only other [[developed country]] in the region, although the [[economy of Australia]] is by far the largest and most dominant economy in  the region and one of the largest in the world{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}.

''Table correct as of 28 February 2008, Australian figures correct as of 19 April 2012''

==Economic sectors==

===Service industry===
The overwhelming majority of people living in the Pacific islands work in the service industry which includes tourism, education and financial services.  Oceania's largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States and South Korea.  The majority of people living in Australia and to a lesser extent, New Zealand work in mining, electrical and manufacturing sectors also.

===Manufacturing===
The manufacturing of clothing is a major industry in some parts of the Pacific, especially [[Economy of Fiji#Tourism|Fiji]], although this is decreasing.

Australia boasts the largest amount of manufacturing in the region.  Producing cars, electrical equipment, machinery and clothes.

===Tourism===
Tourism has become a large source of income for many in the Pacific; tourists come from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. [[Economy of Fiji#Tourism|Fiji]] currently draws almost half a million tourists each year; more than a quarter from Australia. This contributes $1 billion or more since 1995 to Fiji's economy but the Government of Fiji islands underestimate these figures due to invisible economy inside tourism industry.

===Agriculture and fishing===
Agriculture and natural resources constitutes only 5% to 10% of Oceania's total jobs, but contributes substantially to export performance. The most populous two nations, Australia and New Zealand, are also the most developed and have majority service industries. This dilutes the data from the less developed Pacific Island nations who have major agricultural economies. Most of the Pacific countries (excluding Australia and New Zealand) the primary industry is agriculture. Many nations are still quintessentially agricultural; for example, 80% of the population of [[Vanuatu]] and 70% of the population of [[Fiji]] works in [[agriculture]]. The main produce from the pacific is [[copra]] or [[coconut]], but [[timber]], [[beef]], [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[sugar]] and [[ginger]] are also commonly grown across the [[tropics]] of the [[Pacific]]. [[Fishing]] provides a major [[industry]] for many of the smaller nations in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], although many [[fishing]] areas are exploited by other larger countries, namely Japan. [[Natural Resources]], such as [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[nickel]] and [[gold]], are mined in Australia and the [[Solomon Islands]]. Oceania's largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States, India, South Korea and the [[European Union]].

===International aid and charity===

====Oceanian donor nations====
Oceania's most populous nations, Australia and New Zealand, are both highly developed nations and are large international aid donors. These two wealthy nations share the region with less developed nations which still rely on [[foreign aid]] for [[development aid|development]]. In the 2007/08 financial year Australia provided $3.155 billion worth of official development assistance, of which $2.731 billion will be managed by AusAID. Every week, each Australian puts in around $2.40 to pay for Australia's aid program, amounting to around 1% of the Australian Federal Government expenditure compared to the 42% spent on social security and welfare.

====Oceanian recipient states====
In the [[Solomon Islands]] 50% of government spending is paid for by international donors; namely Australia, New Zealand, the [[European Union]], Japan and the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]).

==Global trade relations==
This region consists of many trading relations because of the small amount of land and limited resources they have. Many have trading economies and are transitioning to a developed economy and infrastructure.

The '''feminist school of criminology''' is a school of [[criminology]] developed in the late 1960s and into the 1970s as a reaction to the general disregard and discrimination of women in the traditional study of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daly|first=Kathleen|last2=Chesney-Lind|first2=Meda|date=1988|title=Feminism and Criminology|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/07418828800089871|journal=Justice Quarterly|volume=5|pages=497–538|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist criminologists note that the field of criminology has historically been dominated by men, leading to the development of criminological theories that focus on the male experience. This  [[patriarch]]al domination is not unique to criminological theory, as it is also reflected in the criminal justice system which is cited as a gender institution itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Britton|first=Dana M.|date=1997|title=GENDERED ORGANIZATIONAL LOGIC: Policy and Practice in Men's and Women's Prisons|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/089124397011006005|journal=Gender and Society|volume=6|pages=796–818|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Lori|date=2010|title=Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Girls’ Sentencing in the Juvenile Justice System|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1557085110380583|journal=Feminist Criminology|volume=5|pages=263–285|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both feminist criminologists, as well as criminologists that do not ascribe to this label, have argued that much of early criminological theory is both inherently [[bias]]ed and [[Androcentrism|androcentric]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chesney-Lind|first=Meda|date=1989|title=Girls' Crime and Woman's Place: Toward a Feminist Model of Female Delinquency|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0011128789035001002|journal=Crime and Delinquency|volume=35|pages=5–29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist criminology challenges mainstream criminology to no longer assume theories explaining male crime are equally valid for explaining crime committed by females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Britton |first=Dana M. |title=Feminism in Criminology: Engendering the Outlaw |url=http://jthomasniu.org/class/781/Assigs/fem-crim.pdf |work=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 571, Feminist Views of the Social Sciences (Sep., 2000), pp. 57-76 |publisher=Sage Publications, Inc. |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is referred to as the "generalizability problem" (i.e. "adding" women to male knowledge, whereby the findings from research on men are generalized to women). By utilizing a  feminist methodology, feminist criminologists work to address the "gender ratio" problem (i.e. why women are less likely than men to commit crime).

The feminist school of criminology was closely associated with the emergence of the [[Second Wave Feminism]] and it speaks with multiple viewpoints developed from different feminist writers. There is no one feminist criminology. Similar to feminist theory as a whole, there are debates within the field as to the cause of inequality that shape multiple perspectives within this branch of criminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SIMPSON|first=SALLY S.|date=November 1989|title=FEMINIST THEORY, CRIME, AND JUSTICE*|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1989.tb01048.x|journal=Criminology|language=en|volume=27|issue=4|pages=605–632|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1989.tb01048.x|issn=0011-1384|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The feminist school of criminology  emphasizes that the social roles of women are different from the roles of men, leading to different pathways toward deviance, crime, and victimization that are overlooked by other criminological theories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Early feminist criminologists noted the need for feminist criminology based on three areas in criminology where scholarship about women (in comparison to men) was sparse. These areas include women as criminal offenders, women as victims of crime, and women working in the field of criminal justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invisible Woman|last=Belknap|first=Joanne|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0-534-15870-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
{{Essay-like|date=March 2008}}
Criminology is the study of crime and criminal justice, and it covers a multitude of topics, but according to those of the feminist school of criminology the principal theories of criminality have been developed from male subjects, have been validated on male subjects, and focus on male victimization.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} This 'sexism' in criminology also influences the [[sentence (law)|sentencing]], [[punishment]], and [[imprisonment]] of women who are not expected to be criminals and, if they are, they may be described as 'mad, not bad'.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, 1995: xvii as cited in KeltaWeb (2005): A Feminist Perspective on Women and Crime. Available from: http://www.keltawebconcepts.com.au/efemcrim1.htm. [Accessed 09/08/05]&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of madness to women flows from the entirely outdated construct that women who conform are pure, obedient daughters, wives, and mothers who benefit society and men. If they dared to go against their natural biological traits of 'passivity' and a 'weakness of compliance', they must be mentally ill: a classic androcentric view which has been held by few academics in decades. [[Feminism]] operates within the existing social structures to examine the social, political, and economic experience of women and to devise strategies for achieving greater equality (via inequality) in women's roles. This involves considering how women came to occupy subservient roles, the nature of [[male privilege]], and the means whereby the discourses that constitute the power of [[patriarchy]] can be redirected to transform society.

As it is, gender role expectations continue to define acceptable behaviors and attitudes for females and males; deviation from these expectations may result in a variety of societal sanctions ranging from verbal abuse to violence to incarceration. These roles are a powerful form of social
control maintained through informal and formal mechanisms. Heidensohn (1992, 2000) suggests a male-biased control theory:
*"a woman's place is in the home": a woman has fewer opportunities for criminal activity because the routine of domesticity keeps her in the home. In any event, women are more afraid to go out of the home after dark because they fear aggressive male behavior.
*at work, men have a supervisory or managerial role (often characterized by women as harassment) which makes it more difficult for women to commit major crimes.
Further, those of the feminist school of criminology claim that men are the dominant group and the standard of normality and have maintained inequality through control of the definition of deviance and of the institutions of social control.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Naffine argues that women have been defined as different from men and, hence, inferior; that stigma has acted to deny them their full [[civil rights]] and access to societal resources (Naffine: 1996).

Feminists waves may have brought greater liberation to women, but have not changed their pattern of crime. Women are still much less likely to commit crime; this includes both blue and white collar crime.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Feminist criminology is conflict based calling for the downgrading of many dominant crime theories, as they were constructed without consideration for feminist viewpoints. Feminists now call for the inclusion of women into criminological teaching, research, theory and publications.&lt;ref&gt;Vito, G. and Holmes, R. (1994). Criminology. Theory, Research and Policy. International Thomson Publishing, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most criminological texts (from 19th century men) and discussions almost forgot about women as they were afforded little attention as they were grouped with juvenile delinquents and the mentally insane.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Smart argues this grouping with the more neglected members of the criminal world was a reflection of the females role in the community; women had lacked "civil and legal status", therefore it was acceptable for women to be grouped with juvenile offenders and mentally challenged offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, C. (1976). Women, Crime and Criminology. Routledge and Kegan Paul, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Smart continues by arguing that the study of criminology was always in reference to men, in reference to a male's rationality, motivation, alienation and his victim who was always male. The disqualification of women from the criminological field was evident in criminological texts as it was assumed the man could speak for her. In criminology, just as in society, man was the center of the universe and women were merely their complement.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Gender ratio===
Research methods are "technique(s) for ... gathering data" and are either quantitative or qualitative. It has been argued that methodology has been gendered (Oakley 1997; 1998), with quantitative methods traditionally being associated with words such as positivism, scientific, objectivity, statistics and masculinity, while qualitative methods have generally been associated with interpretivism, non-scientific, subjectivity and femininity. These associations have led some feminist researchers to criticize or even reject the quantitative approach, arguing that it is in direct conflict with the aims of feminist research, though other have argued that this rejection is merely because those feminist writers did not like the results of the quantitative analysis. It has been argued that qualitative methods are more appropriate for feminist research by allowing subjective knowledge (read untestable facts and assertions based on 'common knowledge'), and a more equal relationship between the researcher and the researched (Westmarland: 2001). The statistics generated by crime reporting show that fewer women commit crimes, and far fewer women are victims of crime, but there has been little research to explain this difference.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

====The history of male stereotypes====
Critique has been the essential tool for the production of feminist theory. Victorian America viewed women in accordance with inflexible ideals of femininity, and the male-dominated criminal courts were inhibited by notions of [[chivalry]] when required to apply [[justice]] to women whom cultural norms had determined to be "pure, passive and dependent", and whom, leading experts claimed, seldom committed crimes. Feminist criminology challenged 'malestream' criminology. Later, [[Otto Pollak]] (1950) claimed that men were [[socialisation|socialised]] to treat women in a fatherly and protective manner. Female offenders were like their mothers and wives, and the male judiciary could not imagine them behaving in a criminal way. Women were therefore protected: their criminal activity was less likely to be detected, reported, prosecuted, or sentenced harshly. Chivalry had only positive effects on women who were essentially more deceitful than men, and were the instigators rather than the perpetrators of crime.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} This greater capacity for deceit may have come from the 'passive' role which, according to Pollack, women have to assume during sexual intercourse. Less flatteringly, ''The Criminality of Women'' also claimed that women prefer professions like maids, nurses, teachers, and homemakers so that they can engage in undetectable crime. He also thought women were especially subject to certain mental diseases like [[kleptomania]] and [[nymphomania]].

The most investigated "difference" between the sexes was biological. [[Cesare Lombroso]] (1903) identified the female [[physiognomy]] thought most likely to determine criminal propensity. This was the new science of "criminal anthropology" matching the general fascination with [[Darwinism]] and [[physical anthropology]], where scientists sought [[pathology|pathological]] and [[atavism|atavistic]] causes for criminal behaviour. While he credited criminal women as being stronger than men, the consequence was that prison would hardly affect them at all. Lombroso concluded true female criminals were rare and showed few signs of [[degeneration]] because they had "evolved less than men due to the inactive nature of their lives".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, R. (2001). An Introduction to Criminological Theory. Willan Publishing, Devon.&lt;/ref&gt; Lombroso argued it was the females' natural passivity that withheld them from breaking the law, as they lacked the 
intelligence and initiative to become criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Women and the Criminal Justice System | publisher=Pearson | year=2014 | location=Boston | pages=400 | isbn=978-0-13-314135-1 | edition=4th | last1=van Wormer | first1=Katherine Stuart | last2=Bartollas | first2=Clemens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] theorized that all women experience [[penis envy]] and seek to compensate for this [[inferiority complex]] by being [[exhibitionism|exhibitionistic]] and [[narcissistic]], focusing on irrational and trivial matters instead of being interested in building a just civilisation. [[William I. Thomas]] (1907) published ''Sex and Society'' in which he argued that men and women possessed essentially different personality traits. Men were more criminal because of their biologically determined active natures. Women were more passive and less criminally capable. In ''The Unadjusted Girl'' (1923) he argued that women have a greater capacity to love than men and they suffer more when they do not receive social approval and affection. The "unadjusted girls" are those who use their sexuality in a socially unacceptable way to get what they want from life. The female criminal forgoes the conventional rewards of domesticity by refusing to accept prevailing modes of sexuality and seeks excitement, wealth, and luxury: a pursuit that may conflict with the interests of the social group as it also exercises the freedom to pursue similar goals.

====More modern theories====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}

[[Strain theory (sociology)|Strain theories]] are criticised by feminists as betraying a double standard. When male offenders commit a crime under certain conditions of opportunity blockage, their commission of crime is somehow seen as a "normal" or functional response. When women commit crime, Strain Theory views it as some sort of "weakness". Naffine (1987) probably represents the best example of this critique, but there are other critiques, such as the characterisation of females as "helpmates" or facilitators of crime in the Strain Theories of [[Albert K. Cohen]], and [[Richard Cloward]] and [[Lloyd Ohlin]].

The research methodology in [[Social learning theory|Social Learning Theories]], such as [[Edwin Sutherland]]'s [[differential association|Differential Association Theory]], is criticised for relying on male examples, using case studies of males only, and being a male-dominated perspective that glamorises the male criminal, or at least the sociable, gregarious, active, and athletic characteristics of the male criminal. Similarly, [[Social control theory|Social Control Theories]], such as Hirschi's Social Bond Theory, focuses almost exclusively on social class at the expense of gender and race.

===Female theories about female offending===
Adler (1975) proposed that the emancipation of women during the 1970s increased economic opportunities for women and allowed women to be as crime-prone as men. While "women have demanded equal opportunity in the fields of legitimate endeavours, a similar number of determined women have forced their way into the world of major crime such as [[white-collar crime]], murder, and robbery" (Adler, 1975: 3). She suggested that as women were climbing up the corporate business ladder, they were making use of their 'vocational liberation' to pursue careers in white-collar crime. However, feminism has made female crime more visible through increased reporting, policing and the sentencing of female offenders and, even then, the statistical base is small in comparison to men.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Carlen (1985) argues that Adler's 'new female criminal' is cast as the 'biological female' who is essentially masculine. The 'new female' criminal turns out to be the 'old maladjusted masculine female' of traditional criminology, rejecting her proper feminine role such as institutionalising rather than incarcerating women who commit 'male' offences such as robbery, i.e. Adler's 'sisters in crime' appears to work within the frameworks of traditional criminology rather than a feminist one. For an examination of gender in crimes of violence, see Alder.

A debate in the recent criminology literature has focused on the handling of female offenders as they are processed through the criminal justice system. There are two competing perspectives. The chivalry or [[paternalism]] hypothesis which echoes the perception of female inmates as victims, argues that women are treated more leniently than men at various stages of the supposedly male-dominated justice process as a function of the male desire to protect the weaker (Crew: 1991; Erez, 1992). The "evil women" hypothesis holds that women often receive harsher treatment than men in the criminal justice system and suggests that this different treatment results from the notion that criminal women have violated not only legal boundaries but also gender role expectations (Chesney-Lind, 1984; Erez, 1992). Simon (1975) predicted that the criminal justice system would start treating men and women offenders equally. There is mixed empirical evidence for this emancipation or liberation thesis, and some would say that absolutely no empirical evidence exists for it and the notion is discredited (Chesney-Lind &amp; Pasko 2004). Sex differentials in sentencing are subject to a variety of interpretations, and not all feminists want the criminal justice system to treat women equally. It seems that women are not committing the "big take" offences like stock fraud and other white-collar crimes, or bank robberies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Instead, they are admitted to the justice system charged with committing different crimes. Wundersitz (1988) and Crew (1991) consider the chivalry and paternalism factors in the process.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

Farrington and Morris (1983) found some empirical evidence that women did receive less severe punishments, but female offenders are far more likely to be first-time offenders, and to have committed a less serious form of the relevant offence; they stole smaller or fewer items, used less violence, and so on. Prior history of offending, and seriousness of offence, are fundamental factors in determining severity of sentence, for any offender. Once these variables are entered into the equation, it is possible to conclude that female offenders are not being treated any differently from males in equivalent circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} However, the evidence does suggest that married women with a caring role are more likely to be treated leniently.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Unmarried women or those in unconventional relationships tended to receive more harsh treatment, confirming a sentencing model based a cultural need to reinforce gender roles within a framework of heterosexual marriage or family life.{{synthesis inline|date=July 2012}} Kruttschnitt (1982) investigated the link between economic independence, informal social control, and heavier sentences for women. In a study of convictions in a Californian population in the 1970s Kruttschnitt found that sentence may differ with the extent to which a woman is economically dependent upon someone else for her day-to-day existence: the more dependent she is, the less severe her disposition. Thus, the degree to which a female offender can be shown to be under informal social control may produce a lighter formal sentence.{{synthesis inline|date=July 2012}}

Chapman (1980) studied the connection between labour force participation and{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}, and revealed an increase in female criminal activity during times of economic hardship. The smallest increases in arrests coincided with periods of the greatest increase in economic activity with the most common offense being that of shop lifting. These findings would seem to support a theory of a relationship between employment and crime rather than that offered by the 'women's liberation thesis'.{{synthesis inline|date=July 2012}} When times are good, the offending woman appears to stabilise rather than escalate. An absence rather than availability of employment opportunities (liberation thesis) would seem a more plausible explanation for increases in female crime.{{original research inline|date=July 2012}} Naffine (1987: 99) believes the criminal woman's motive appears more rational and straight forward than manifesting her gender-role concerns or seeking to compete with the criminal male.

==Biological explanations of female criminality==
Criminology texts usually do not cover the broad possibilities that may account for female criminality.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} A criticism of criminological explanations of female crime is its insistence on presuming the nature of females and their predisposition away from crime.  Smart (1976:176) argues that this determinate model of female criminality assumes an "inherent and natural distinction exists between the temperament, ability and conditionability of men and women". Past studies of women have developed myths about female criminality{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}; criminologists have explained female criminals as being more "cruel and sinister than that of the male. She is described as unnatural, masculine" (Burke 2001:162), and lacking the qualities that would make them reserved and obedient females. This approach has been criticised{{according to whom|date=July 2012}} as it assumes any female that varies from the traditional female role is criminal or likely criminal and it assumes that there is a large and significant difference between men and women. Smart argues that the differences that exist between males and females are of little importance in the study of crime as the factors that cause crime are "culturally determinate rather than a reflection of the natural qualities of the sexes" (1976:176).

Feminists have levelled complaints at this angle of criminology that assumes females are controlled by their biology and are incapable of thinking for themselves; feminists point out that while criminological thinking has surpassed the gloomy days of [[biological determinism]] and the predetermined actor model of crime, criminological explanations of female crime has not. Some criminologists suggest a link between "hormonal changes in pregnancy, [[menstruation]] and female criminal behaviour" and crime (Burke 2001:164){{verifysource|date=July 2012}}. Furthermore, in criminal cases women have used defences such as [[post-natal depression]] as the reason for [[infanticide]] and other crimes. The reliance upon biological reasons for a female's criminality has reinforced societal views of the biologically criminal female.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Society therefore, neglects to account for other reasons such as social and economic ones for a female's criminal act.{{synthesis inline|date=July 2012}}

==Victimology==
Feminists argue criminological texts neglect the victimisation of women; the victimisation of women is forgotten:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of gender and society, Volume 1 |page=206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nyHS4WyUKEC&amp;pg=PT206 |editor-first=Jodi A. |editor-last=O'Brien |chapter=Crime and Criminal Justice, Gender and |year=2009 |publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Three out of four women will be victims of violent crimes during their lives.&lt;ref name="U.S. v. Morrison"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-5.ZD.html David Souter's dissent in ''U.S. v. Morrison'', 169 F.3d 820]&lt;/ref&gt;

*50 per cent of [[Homelessness|homeless women]] and children are fleeing [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="U.S. v. Morrison"/&gt;
*Less than 1 per cent of rape victims have collected damages.&lt;ref name="U.S. v. Morrison"/&gt;
*Domestic violence costs the state between 5-10 billion each year.&lt;ref&gt;Muraskin, R. and Roberts, A. (2002). Visions for Change. Crime and Justice in the Twenty First Century. Prentice Hall, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;
       
Feminists{{who|date=July 2012}} argue these figures would not be ignored if society was not so accepting of female exploitation. Domestic violence and rape are increasingly being reported, as they have been given greater significance and a deeper understanding by society. Past generations of women have suffered in silence due to the lack of importance the police and criminology have afforded women's victimisation.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Another criticism levied at criminology by feminists is the lack of interest given to women who are the silent sufferer whilst their male partner is in prison. Criminological studies generally focus on the prisoner and his relationship with the penal system, having little interest for the females concerns. Prisoner studies detail the anguish suffered by the imprisoned men who are separated from their families but we hear nothing of the suffering of the women and their families who are the other side of that relationship".&lt;ref&gt;Smart 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Carlen&lt;ref&gt;Carlen, P., (1992) 'Criminal Women and Criminal Justice, the Limits to and the Potential of, Feminist and Left Realist Perspectives', in Matthews, R., and Young, J., (eds), Issues in Realist Criminology. Sage, London.&lt;/ref&gt; believes there are shortcomings in feminist theories of criminality. Carlen points to three key areas of female offending that feminist theory cannot explain; 
*That women's crimes are that of the underclass, suggesting class conflict
*Female offending is disproportionately from ethnic groups suggesting race conflict
*Women in prison have usually suffered from poverty

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21307">'''Gentleman of the Bedchamber''' was a title in the [[royal household]] of the [[Kingdom of England]] from the 11th century, later used also in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].

==Description and functions==
There were always several holders of the office, who were invariably [[gentleman|gentlemen]] and almost invariably [[peerage|peers]], often important ones, as the regular access to the [[monarch]] which the role brought was the most valuable commodity of the [[courtier]].&lt;ref name=bucholz&gt;R. O. Bucholz, "The bedchamber: Gentlemen of the Bedchamber", ''Office-Holders in Modern Britain: Volume 11 (revised): Court Officers, 1660-1837'' (2006), [https://www.british-history.ac.uk/office-holders/vol11/pp14-19 pp. 14-19] accessed 13 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The duties of the office involved waiting on the King when he ate in private, helping him to dress, guarding the bedchamber and water closet, and providing companionship.&lt;ref name=bucholz/&gt;

From 1660 the office of first gentleman of the bedchamber was invariably combined with that of [[Groom of the Stool]].&lt;ref name=bucholz/&gt;

On average the number of Gentlemen varied around 12 but fluctuated from time to time. During the reign of James II there were only 8 and none were appointed during the reign of Queen Anne.

See appendix table 2: "Inmates held in custody in state or federal prisons or in local jails, 2000 and 2012–2013".&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the total number of persons in the adult correctional systems had fallen to 6,851,000 persons, approximately 52,200 fewer offenders than at the year end of 2013 as reported by the BJS. About 1 in 36 adults (or 2.8% of adults in the US) were under some form of correctional supervision – the lowest rate since 1996. On average, the correctional population has declined by 1.0% since 2007; while this continued to stay true in 2014 the number of incarcerated adults slightly increased in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;"Correctional Populations In The United States, 2014" http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5519&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the total number of persons in U.S. adult correctional systems was an estimated 6,613,500.

==History==
{{Main|History of United States prison systems}}
{{Expand section|date=July 2014}}
Throughout the 1500s, the people of England considered idleness to be the cause of many crimes, and therefore found the solution to be creating workhouses as a system to rehabilitate criminals. Though many of the first people, especially in the foundation of these "houses of correction" were actually vagrants without homes. Later, in the 1700s, English philanthropists began to focus on the reform of convicted criminals in prisons, which they believed needed a chance to become morally pure in order to stop or slow crime. Since at least 1740, some of these philosophers began thinking of solitary confinement as a way to create and maintain spiritually clean people in prisons. As English people immigrated to North America, so did these theories of penology.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300042979/rise-penitentiary|title=Rise of the Penitentiary {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Spanish colonizers also brought ideas on confinement.{{Clarify|reason=|date=November 2018}} Spanish soldiers in St. Augustine, Florida built the first substantial prison.{{When|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/With_Liberty_for_Some.html?id=M_DQTqbKcIgC|title=With Liberty for Some: 500 Years of Imprisonment in America|last=Christianson|first=Scott|date=2000-10-19|publisher=UPNE|isbn=9781555534684|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the first structures built in English-settled America were jails, and by the 18th century, every English North American county had a jail. These jails served a variety of functions such as a holding place for debtors, prisoners-of-war, and political prisoners, those bound in the penal transportation and slavery systems, and of those accused-of but not tried for crimes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Sentences for those convicted of crimes were rarely longer than three months, and often lasted only a day. Poor citizens were often imprisoned for longer than their richer neighbors, as bail was rarely not accepted.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1841, [[Dorothea Dix]] discovered that prison conditions in the US were, in her opinion, [[inhumane]]. Prisoners were chained naked, whipped with rods. Others, criminally insane, were caged, or placed in cellars, or closets. She insisted on changes throughout the rest of her life. While focusing on the insane, her comments also resulted in changes for other inmates.&lt;ref name="Dix1843"&gt;{{citation |year=1843 |author=Dix, Dorothea L |title=Memorial to the Legislature of Massachusetts 1843 |page=2 |url=https://archive.org/stream/memorialtolegisl00dixd#page/n4/mode/1up |accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prison systems==
Individuals who violate state laws and/or territorial laws generally are placed in state or territorial prisons, while those who violate [[United States federal law]] are generally placed in federal prisons operated by the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] (BOP), an agency of the [[United States Department of Justice]] (USDOJ). The BOP also houses adult felons convicted of violating District of Columbia laws due to the [[National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997]].

As of 2004, state prisons proportionately house more violent felons, so state prisons in general gained a more negative reputation compared to federal prisons.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, Jayne. "[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/companies/2004-03-18-statetime_x.htm State time or federal prison?]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6f5PNyhfd?url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/companies/2004-03-18-statetime_x.htm Archive]). ''[[USA Today]]''. March 18, 2004. Retrieved on February 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, almost 90% of prisoners were in state prisons; 10% were in federal prisons.&lt;ref name=wsj170128&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-better-approach-to-violent-crime-1485536313 |title=A Better Approach to Violent Crime |accessdate=January 28, 2017 |author1=John Pfaff  |date=January 28, 2017 |newspaper= Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At sentencing in federal court, judges use a point system to determine which inmate goes into which housing branch. This helps federal law employees to determine who goes to which facility and to which punishing housing unit to send them. Another method to determine housing is the admission committees. In prisons, multiple people come together to determine to which housing unit an inmate belongs. People like the case manager, psychologist, and social worker have a voice in what is appropriate for the inmate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holwager|first1=James K.|title=Behavioral management disorders and serious mental illness in a maximum-security prison: it takes a "healthily codependent" staff|journal=Corrections Today|date=August 2012|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-305747637.html|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From [http://www.prisonstudies.org/research-publications?shs_term_node_tid_depth=27 World Prison Population Lists]. By [[International Centre for Prison Studies]]. "The information is the latest available in early December 2008. … Most figures relate to dates between the beginning of 2006 and the end of November 2008." According to the summary on page one there were 2.29 million U.S. inmates and 9.8 million inmates worldwide. The U.S. held 23.4% of the world's inmates. The U.S. total in this report is for December 31, 2007 (see page 3), and does not include inmates in juvenile detention facilities.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, approximately one in every 31 adults (7.3 million) in the United States was either behind bars or being monitored (probation and parole). In recent decades the U.S. has experienced a surge in its prison population, quadrupling since 1980, partially as a result of [[mandatory sentencing]] that came about during the "[[War on Drugs]]."

As of the 2007 Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP), conducted by the [[Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention]], 86,927 youths were held in juvenile facilities.&lt;ref name=cjrp /&gt;&lt;ref name=prisoners2008&gt;[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=1763 Prisoners in 2008].

See 2007 juvenile total [[:File:Total juvenile detention chart for the USA.gif|here]]. Table 8 on page 8 has the incarceration rates for 2000, 2007, and 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, the three states with the lowest ratios of imprisoned people per 100,000 population are [[Maine]] (150 per 100,000), [[Minnesota]] (189 per 100,000), and [[New Hampshire]] (206 per 100,000). The three states with the highest ratio are [[Louisiana]] (881 per 100,000), [[Mississippi]] (702 per 100,000) and [[Oklahoma]] (657 per 100,000).&lt;ref name=prisonersin2009&gt;{{cite web|first1=Heather|last1=West|first2=William|last2=Sabol|date=December 2010|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/p09.pdf|title=Prisoners in 2009|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 report estimated that 27% of federal prison inmates are noncitizens, convicted of crimes while in the country legally or illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05337r.pdf|format=PDF|title=GAO-05-337R Information on Criminal Aliens Incarcerated in Federal and State Prisons and Local Jails|publisher=General Accounting Office|date=April 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, federal prison inmates account for six percent of the total incarcerated population; noncitizen populations in state and local prisons are more difficult to establish.

===Duration===
{{Main|Criminal sentencing in the United States}}

Many legislatures continually have reduced discretion of judges in both the sentencing process and the determination of when the conditions of a sentence have been satisfied. [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines|Determinate sentencing]], use of [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimums]], and [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines|guidelines-based sentencing]] continue to remove the human element from sentencing, such as the prerogative of the judge to consider the [[mitigating factor|mitigating or extenuating circumstances]] of a crime to determine the appropriate length of the incarceration. As the consequence of "[[three strikes laws]]," the increase in the duration of incarceration in the last decade was most pronounced in the case of life prison sentences, which increased by 83% between 1992 and 2003 while violent crimes fell in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Meaning of "Life": Long Prison Sentences in Context|first1=Marc|last1=Mauer|first2=Ryan S|last2=King|first3=Malcolm C|last3=Young|url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/inc_meaningoflife.pdf|publisher=The Sentencing Project|date=May 2004|page=3|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violent and nonviolent crime===
In 2016, there were an estimated 1.2 million violent crimes committed in the United States.&lt;ref name="fbiucr"&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Crime Statistics Released|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2016-crime-statistics-released|website=FBI.gov|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of that year, U.S. law enforcement agencies made approximately 10.7 million arrests, excluding arrests for traffic violations.&lt;ref name="fbiucr"/&gt; In that year, approximately 2.3 million people were incarcerated in jail or prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass Incarceration: The Whole Pie 2016|url=https://nicic.gov/mass-incarceration-whole-pie-2016|website=National Institute of Justice|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Felony Sentences in State Courts.pdf|thumb|''Felony Sentences in State Courts'', study by the [[United States Department of Justice]] ]]

As of September 30, 2009 in federal prisons, 7.9% of sentenced prisoners were incarcerated for violent crimes,&lt;ref name=prisonersin2009 /&gt; while at year end 2008 of sentenced prisoners in state prisons, 52.4% had been jailed for violent crimes.&lt;ref name=prisonersin2009 /&gt; In 2002 (latest available data by type of offense), 21.6% of convicted inmates in jails were in prison for violent crimes. Among unconvicted inmates in jails in 2002, 34% had a violent offense as the most serious charge. 41% percent of convicted and unconvicted jail inmates in 2002 had a current or prior violent offense; 46% were nonviolent recidivists.&lt;ref name=jailinmates2002&gt;[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=1118 Profile of Jail Inmates, 2002]. By Doris J. James. July 18, 2004. NCJ 201932. [[U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics]]. See Table 3 of the [http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/pji02.pdf PDF file] for the percent of inmates in for violent offenses.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2008, the state prison population increased by 159,200 prisoners, and violent offenders accounted for 60% of this increase. The number of [[drug offender]]s in state prisons declined by 12,400 over this period. Furthermore, while the number of sentenced violent offenders in state prison increased from 2000 through 2008, the expected length of stays for these offenders declined slightly during this period.&lt;ref name=prisonersin2009 /&gt;

In 2016, about 200,000, under 16%, of the 1.3 million people in state jails, were serving time for drug offenses. 700,000 were incarcerated for violent offenses.&lt;ref name=wsj170128/&gt;

Violent crime was not responsible for the quadrupling of the incarcerated population in the United States from 1980 to 2003. Violent crime rates had been relatively constant or declining over those decades. The prison population was increased primarily by public policy changes causing more prison sentences and lengthening time served, for example through mandatory minimum sentencing, "three strikes" laws, and reductions in the availability of parole or early release. 49% of sentenced state inmates were held for violent offenses.

{{Main|War on Drugs}}Perhaps the single greatest force behind the growth of the prison population has been the national "[[War on Drugs]]". The War on Drugs initiative expanded during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. President Reagan established the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986]]. According to the [[Human Rights Watch]], legislation like this led to the extreme increase in drug offense imprisonment and "increasing racial disproportions among the arrestees".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2000/usa/Rcedrg00-05.htm|title=United States - Punishment and Prejudice: Racial Disparities in the War on Drugs|website=www.hrw.org|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of incarcerated drug offenders has increased twelvefold since 1980. In 2000, 22 percent of those in federal and state prisons were convicted on drug charges.&lt;ref name="hrw2003"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/usa/incarceration/ "Incarcerated America"] ''Human Rights Watch'' (April 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crimerates"&gt;[http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm United States Crime Rates 1960–2009]. Source: FBI, Uniform Crime Reports.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, 55.6% of the 1,131,210 sentenced prisoners in state prisons were being held for violent crimes (this number excludes the 200,966 prisoners being held due parole violations, of which 39.6% were re-incarcerated for a subsequent violent crime).&lt;ref name="BJS2012Trends"&gt;[http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p12tar9112.pdf U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics: "Prisoners in 2012 Trends in Admissions and Releases, 1991–2012" by E.

===Recidivism===
{{Main|Recidivism in the United States}}
A 2002 study survey, showed that among nearly 275,000 prisoners released in 1994, 67.5% were rearrested within 3&amp;nbsp;years, and 51.8% were back in prison.&lt;ref name="Langan"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Patrick A.|last1=Langan|first2=David J.|last2=Levin|date=June 2, 2002|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/rpr94.pdf|format=PDF |title=Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1994 |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study found no evidence that spending more time in prison raises the [[recidivism]] rate, and found that those serving the longest time, 61&amp;nbsp;months or more, had a slightly lower re-arrest rate (54.2%) than every other category of prisoners. This is most likely explained by the older average age of those released with the longest sentences, and the study shows a strong negative correlation between recidivism and age upon release.

Indeed, the mere number of sentences imposed here would not place the United States at the top of the incarceration lists.

Through the [[juvenile court]]s and the adult [[criminal justice]] system, the United States incarcerates more of its youth than any other country in the world, a reflection of the larger trends in incarceration practices in the United States. This has been a source of controversy for a number of reasons, including the overcrowding and violence in youth detention facilities, the prosecution of youths as adults and the long term consequences of incarceration on the individual's chances for success in adulthood. In 2014, the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] criticized the United States for about ten judicial abuses, including the mistreatment of juvenile inmates.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Pilkington (March 13, 2014). [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/us-un-human-rights-abuses-nsa-drones US criticised by UN for human rights failings on NSA, guns and drones]. ''[[The Guardian]].'' Retrieved April 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A UN report published in 2015 criticized the US for being the only nation in the world to sentence juveniles to life imprisonment without parole.&lt;ref&gt;Natasja Sheriff (March 9, 2015). [http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/3/9/un-expert-slams-us-as-only-nation-to-sentence-kids-to-life-without-parole.html UN expert slams US as only nation to imprison kids for life without parole]. ''[[Al Jazeera America]].'' Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to federal data from 2011, around 40% of the nation's juvenile inmates are housed in [[Private prison|private facilities]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Kirkham (October 22, 2013). [http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/prisoners-of-profit?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000009 Prisoners of Profit: Private Prison Empire Rises Despite Startling Record Of Juvenile Abuse]. ''[[The Huffington Post]].'' Retrieved October 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The incarceration of youths has been linked to the effects of family and neighborhood influences. One study found that the "behaviors of family members and neighborhood peers appear to substantially affect the behavior and outcomes of disadvantaged youths".&lt;ref&gt;Case, Anne C., and Lawrence F. Katz. ''The company you keep: The effects of family and neighborhood on disadvantaged youths''. No. w3705. National Bureau of Economic Research, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aged===
The percentage of prisoners in federal and state prisons aged 55 and older increased by 33% from 2000 to 2005 while the prison population grew by 8%. The [[Southern Legislative Conference]] found that in 16 southern states, the elderly prisoner population increased on average by 145% between 1997 and 2007. The growth in the elderly population brought along higher health care costs, most notably seen in the 10% average increase in state prison budgets from 2005 to 2006.

The SLC expects the percentage of elderly prisoners relative to the overall prison population to continue to rise. Ronald Aday, a professor of aging studies at [[Middle Tennessee State University]] and author of ''Aging Prisoners: Crisis in American Corrections'', concurs. One out of six prisoners in California is serving a [[life sentence]]. Aday predicts that by 2020 16% percent of those serving life sentences will be elderly.&lt;ref name=aa&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-29-aging-inmates_N.htm?csp=34 |title=Aging inmates clogging nation's prisons|agency=Associated Press|date=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ab&gt;{{cite book|title=Aging Prisoners: Crisis in American Corrections|author= Aday, Ronald H.|publisher=Praeger|year=2003|isbn=978-0-275-97123-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State governments pay all of their inmates' housing costs which significantly increase as prisoners age. Inmates are unable to apply for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]]. Most Departments of Correction report spending more than 10 percent of the annual budget on elderly care.&lt;ref name=aa /&gt;&lt;ref name=ab /&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] published a report in 2012 which asserts that the elderly prison population has climbed 1300% since the 1980s, with 125,000 inmates aged 55 or older now incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/13/elderly-inmate-population-soars_n_1594793.html|title=Elderly Inmate Population Soared 1,300 Percent Since 1980s: Report|agency=The Huffington Post|date=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT people===
[[Transgender]] adults and [[LGBT]] (lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender) youth are disproportionately more likely than the general population to come into contact with the [[criminal justice]] system. According to the [[National Center for Transgender Equality]], 16 percent of transgender adults have been in prison and/or jail, compared to 2.7 percent of all adults.&lt;ref name="Marksamer &amp; Tobin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marksamer|first1=Jody|last2=Tobin|first2=Harper|title=Standing With LGBT Prisoners: An Advocate's Guide to Ending Abuse and Combating Imprisonment|date=2013|publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality|location=Washington, DC|pages=1–88|url=http://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/resources/JailPrisons_Resource_FINAL.pdf|accessdate=February 14, 2015|ref=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that 13–15 percent of youth in detention identify as LGBT, whereas an estimated 4-8 percent of the general youth population identify as such.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tobin|first1=Harper|title=Putting Prisons on the LGBT Agenda|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harper-jean-tobin/putting-prisons-on-the-lg_b_5065219.html|accessdate=February 14, 2015|work=The Huffington Post|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=April 1, 2014|ref=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons behind these disproportionate numbers are multi-faceted and complex.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} [[Poverty]], [[homelessness]], [[Offender profiling|profiling]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} by law enforcement, and imprisonment are disproportionately experienced by transgender and [[gender non-conforming]] people.&lt;ref name=Tobin /&gt;  LGBT youth not only experience these same challenges, but many also live in homes unwelcoming to their identities.&lt;ref name="Sylvia R Law Project"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassichis|first1=Daniel|title="It's War In Here": A Report on the Treatment of Transgender and Intersex People in New York State Men's Prisons|date=2007|publisher=Sylvia Rivera Law Project|pages=1–50|url=http://srlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/WarinHere042007.pdf|accessdate=February 14, 2015|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often results in LGBT youth running away and/or engaging in criminal activities, such as the drug trade, sex work, and/or theft, which places them at higher risk for arrest. Because of discriminatory practices and limited access to resources, transgender adults are also more likely to engage in criminal activities to be able to pay for housing, health care, and other basic needs.&lt;ref name="Sylvia R Law Project" /&gt;

[[LGBT people in prison|LGBT people in jail and prison]] are particularly vulnerable to mistreatment by other inmates and staff.

===Mental illness===
{{Main|Mentally ill people in United States jails and prisons}}

In the United States, the percentage of inmates with [[mental illness]] has been steadily increasing, with rates more than quadrupling from 1998 to 2006.&lt;ref name=Horowitz&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Horowitz|first1=Alana|title=Mental Illness Soars In Prisons, Jails While Inmates Suffer|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/mental-illness-prisons-jails-inmates_n_2610062.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|accessdate=February 15, 2015|ref=1|date=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have attributed this trend to the [[deinstitutionalization]] of mentally ill persons beginning in the 1960s, when mental hospitals across the country began closing their doors.&lt;ref name=NIC&gt;{{cite web|title=Mentally Ill Persons in Corrections|url=http://nicic.gov/mentalillness|website=nicic.gov|publisher=National Institute of Corrections|accessdate=February 15, 2015|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geller&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geller|first1=Adam|title=U.S. Jails Struggle With Role As Makeshift Asylums|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/us-jails-struggle-with-role-as-makeshift-asylums/|accessdate=October 18, 2018|work=The Seattle Times|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=July 15, 2014|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other researchers indicate that "there is no evidence for the basic criminalization premise that decreased psychiatric services explain the disproportionate risk of incarceration for individuals with mental illness".&lt;ref name=Skeem&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skeem|first1=Jennifer|last2=Manchak|first2=Sarah|last3=Peterson|first3=Jillian|title=Correctional Policy for Offenders with Mental Illness: Creating a New Paradigm for Recidivism Reduction|journal=Law and Human Behavior|date=April 2011|volume=35|issue=2|pages=110–126|doi=10.1007/s10979-010-9223-7|pmid=20390443|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], over half of all prisoners in 2005 had experienced mental illness as identified by "a recent history or symptoms of a mental health problem"; of this population, jail inmates experienced the highest rates of symptoms of mental illness at 60 percent, followed by 49 percent of state prisoners and 40 percent of federal prisoners.&lt;ref name="James &amp; Glaze"&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Doris|last2=Glaze|first2=Lauren|title=Mental Health Problems of Prison and Jail Inmates|date=December 14, 2006|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice: Office of Justice Programs: Bureau of Justice Statistics|pages=1–12|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mhppji.pdf|accessdate=February 16, 2015|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do people with recent histories of mental illness end up incarcerated, but many who have no history of mental illness end up developing symptoms while in prison. In 2006, the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that a quarter of state prisoners had a history of mental illness, whereas 3 in 10 state prisoners had developed symptoms of mental illness since becoming incarcerated with no recent history of mental illness.&lt;ref name="James &amp; Glaze" /&gt;

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], one of the contributing factors to the disproportionate rates of mental illness in prisons and jails is the increased use of [[solitary confinement]], for which "socially and psychologically meaningful contact is reduced to the absolute minimum, to a point that is insufficient for most detainees to remain mentally well functioning".&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mental Illness, Human Rights, and US Prisons: Human Rights Watch Statement for the Record Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law|date=September 22, 2009|publisher=Human Rights Watch|pages=1–14|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/Human%20Rights%20Watch%20Statement%20for%20the%20Record_9_22_09.pdf|accessdate=February 20, 2015|ref=6}} See p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor to be considered is that most inmates do not get the mental health services that they need while incarcerated. Due to limited funding, prisons are not able to provide a full range of mental health services and thus are typically limited to inconsistent administration of [[psychotropic medication]], or no psychiatric services at all.&lt;ref name=Geller /&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch" /&gt; Human Rights Watch also reports that corrections officers routinely use excessive violence against mentally ill inmates for nonthreatening behaviors related to [[schizophrenia]] or [[bipolar disorder]]. Inmates are often shocked, shackled and pepper sprayed.&lt;ref&gt;Marisa Taylor (May 12, 2015). [http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/5/12/mentally-ill-inmates-often-physically-abused.html Report: Mentally ill inmates are routinely abused by corrections officers]. ''[[Al Jazeera America]].'' Retrieved May 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many argue that prisons have become the facilities for the mentally ill, very few crimes point directly to symptoms of mental illness as their sole cause.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson et al APA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Jillian|last2=Skeem|first2=Jennifer|last3=Kennealy|first3=Patrick|last4=Bray|first4=Beth|last5=Zvonkovic|first5=Andrea|title=How Often and How Consistently do Symptoms Directly Precede Criminal Behavior Among Offenders With Mental Illness?|journal=Law and Human Behavior|date=2014|volume=38|issue=5|pages=439–449|doi=10.1037/lhb0000075|pmid=24730388|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/lhb-0000075.pdf|accessdate=February 20, 2015|ref=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the disproportionate representation of mentally ill persons in prison, a study by [[American Psychological Association]] indicates that only 7.5 percent of crimes committed were found to be directly related to mental illness.&lt;ref name="Peterson et al APA" /&gt; However, some advocates argue that many incarcerations of mentally ill persons could have been avoided if they had been given proper treatment,&lt;ref name=Horowitz /&gt;&lt;ref name=NIC /&gt;&lt;ref name=Torrey&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrey|first1=E.

Mental illness rarely stands alone when analyzing the risk factors associated with incarceration and [[recidivism]] rates.&lt;ref name="James &amp; Glaze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson et al APA" /&gt; The American Psychological Association recommends a holistic approach to reducing recidivism rates among offenders by providing "cognitive–behavioral treatment focused on criminal cognition" or "services that target variable risk factors for high-risk offenders" due to the numerous intersecting risk factors experienced by mentally ill and non-mentally ill offenders alike.&lt;ref name="Peterson et al APA" /&gt;

To prevent the recidivism of individuals with mental illness, a variety of programs are in place that are based on criminal justice or mental health intervention models. Programs modeled after criminal justice strategies include [[diversion program]]s, [[mental health courts]], specialty mental health [[probation]] or [[parole]], and jail aftercare/prison re-entry. Programs modeled after mental health interventions include forensic [[assertive community treatment]] and forensic intensive [[case management (mental health)|case management]]. It has been argued that the wide diversity of these program interventions points to a lack of clarity on which specific program components are most effective in reducing recidivism rates among individuals with mental illness.&lt;ref name=Skeem /&gt;

=== Students ===
{{main|School-to-prison-pipeline}}The term "school-to-prison-pipeline", also known as the "schoolhouse-to-jailhouse track", is a concept that was named in the 1980s. The school-to-prison pipeline is the idea that a school's harsh punishments—which typically push students out of the classroom—lead to the criminalization of students' misbehaviors and result in increasing a student's probability of entering the prison system.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Biehl, The School-to-Prison Pipeline, 28 OHIO LAWYER, Jan.–Feb. 2014,&lt;/ref&gt; Although the school-to-prison pipeline is aggravated by a combination of ingredients, [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero-tolerance policies]] are viewed as main contributors.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Pedersen, ''Zero-Tolerance Policies'', ''in'' SCHOOL VIOLENCE: FROM DISCIPLINE TO DUE PROCESS 48 (James C. Hanks ed., 2004); ''see also'' CATHERINE Y. KIM, DANIEL J. LOSEN &amp; DAMON T. HEWITT, THE SCHOOL-TO-PRISON PIPELINE: STRUCTURING LEGAL REFORM 79 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero-tolerance policies are regulations that mandate specific consequences in response to outlined student misbehavior, typically without any consideration for the unique circumstances surrounding a given incident.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph M. Gerstein &amp; Lois A. Gerstein ''Education Law: An Essential Guide for Attorneys, Teachers, Administrators, Parents and Students 195'' (2nd ed. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Zero-tolerance policies both implicitly and explicitly usher the student into the prison track. Implicitly, when a student is extracted from the classroom, the more likely that student is to drop out of school as a result of being in class less. As a dropout, that child is then ill-prepared to obtain a job and become a fruitful citizen.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dep't of Educ. Office for Civil Rights, ''School Climate and Discipline'', &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/index.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly, schools sometimes do not funnel their pupils to the prison systems inadvertently; rather, they send them directly.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Y. Kim, ''Policing School Discipline'', 77 BROOK. L. REV. 861, 901–02 (2012); Moll &amp; Simmons, ''supra'' note 22, at 7; Advancement Project, ''Clayton County, GA'', &lt;nowiki&gt;http://safequalityschools.org/pages/clayton-county-ga&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[https://perma.cc/8CKX-URDD]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (last visited Feb. 1, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Once in juvenile court, even sympathetic judges are not likely to evaluate whether the school's punishment was warranted or fair. For these reasons, it is argued that zero-tolerance policies lead to an exponential increase in the juvenile prison populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heitzeg|first=Nancy A.|year=2009|title=Education  Or  Incarceration:  Zero Tolerance Policies And The  School  To Prison Pipeline|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ870076.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security levels===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
In some, but not all, states' department of corrections, inmates reside in different facilities that vary by security level, especially in security measures, administration of inmates, type of housing, and weapons and tactics used by [[corrections officer]]s. The federal government's [[Bureau of Prisons]] uses a numbered scale from one to five to represent the security level. Level five is the most secure, while level one is the least. State prison systems operate similar systems. California, for example, classifies its facilities from Reception Center through Levels I to V (minimum to maximum security) to specialized high security units (all considered Level V) including [[Security Housing Unit]] (SHU)—California's version of [[supermax]]—and related units. As a general rule, county jails, detention centers, and reception centers, where new commitments are first held while either awaiting trial or before being transferred to "mainline" institutions to serve out their sentences, operate at a relatively high level of security, usually close security or higher.

'''[[Supermax prison]]''' facilities provide the highest level of prison security. These units hold those considered the most dangerous inmates, as well as inmates that have been deemed too high-profile or too great a national security risk for a normal prison. These include inmates who have committed assaults, murders, or other serious violations in less secure facilities, and inmates known to be or accused of being [[prison gang]] members. Most states have either a supermax section of a prison facility or an entire prison facility designated as a supermax. The [[United States Federal Bureau of Prisons]] operates a federal supermax, [[ADX Florence|A.D.X. Florence]], located in [[Florence, Colorado]], also known as the "[[Alcatraz]] of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]" and widely considered to be perhaps the most secure prison in the United States. A.D.X. Florence has a standard supermax section where assaultive, violent, and gang-related inmates are kept under normal supermax conditions of 23-hour confinement and abridged amenities. A.D.X. Florence is considered to be of a security level above that of all other prisons in the United States, at least in the "ideological" ultramax part of it, which features permanent, 24-hour [[solitary confinement]] with rare human contacts or opportunity to earn better conditions through good behavior.

In a '''maximum security''' prison or area (called '''high security''' in the federal system), all prisoners have individual cells&lt;ref name="What Do Security Levels Means?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/journal/injustice/Security.html|title=What Do Security Levels Means|publisher=Injustice Security|language=English|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with sliding doors controlled from a secure remote control station. Prisoners are allowed out of their cells one out of twenty four hours (one hour and 30&amp;nbsp;minutes for prisoners in California). When out of their cells, prisoners remain in the cell block or an exterior cage. Movement out of the cell block or "pod" is tightly restricted using restraints and escorts by correctional officers.
[[File:US Incarceration Rates in 2016.svg|thumb|U.S. state prisoner distribution in 2016; excludes jail inmates. Data Source: https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=6226]]
Under '''close security''', prisoners usually have one- or two-person cells operated from a remote control station. Each cell has its own toilet and sink. Inmates may leave their cells for work assignments or correctional programs and otherwise may be allowed in a common area in the cellblock or an exercise yard. The fences are generally double fences with watchtowers housing armed guards, plus often a third, lethal-current electric fence in the middle.

Prisoners that fall into the '''medium security''' group may sleep in cells, but share them two and two, and use bunk beds&lt;ref name="What Do Security Levels Means?"/&gt; with lockers to store their possessions. The cell may have showers, toilets and sinks, but it's not a strictly enforced rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonlawblog.com/blog/inmate-housing-federal-bureau-prisons#.WHvKkPnhDIV|title=Inmate Housing in the Federal Bureau of Prisons|publisher=Prison Law Blog|language=English|author=Christopher Zoukis|date=19 May 2013|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells are locked at night with one or more correctional officers supervising. There is less supervision over the internal movements of prisoners. The perimeter is generally double fenced and regularly patrolled.

Prisoners in '''minimum security''' facilities are considered to pose little physical risk to the public and are mainly non-violent "[[white collar crime|white collar criminals]]". Minimum security prisoners live in less-secure dormitories,&lt;ref name="What Do Security Levels Means?"/&gt; which are regularly patrolled by correctional officers. As in medium security facilities, they have communal showers, toilets, and sinks. A minimum-security facility generally has a single fence that is watched, but not patrolled, by armed guards. At facilities in very remote and rural areas, there may be no fence at all. Prisoners may often work on community projects, such as roadside litter cleanup with the state department of transportation or wilderness conservation. Many minimum security facilities are small camps located in or near military bases, larger prisons (outside the security perimeter) or other government institutions to provide a convenient supply of convict labor to the institution. Many states allow persons in minimum-security facilities access to the Internet.

===Correspondence===
Research indicates that inmates who maintain contact with family and friends in the outside world are less likely to be convicted of further crimes and usually have an easier reintegration period back into society.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;!-- dead ref: [http://web.archiver.org/web/20070618072022/http://www.fcc.state.fl.us/fcc/reports/family/famiii.html] --&gt; Many institutions encourage friends and families to send letters, especially when they are unable to visit regularly. However, guidelines exist as to what constitutes acceptable mail, and these policies are strictly enforced.

Mail sent to inmates in violation of prison policies can result in sanctions such as loss of [[Good conduct time|imprisonment time reduced for good behavior]]. Most [[Department of Corrections]] websites provide detailed information regarding mail policies. These rules can even vary within a single prison depending on which part of the prison an inmate is housed. For example, [[death row]] and [[Supermax|maximum security]] inmates are usually under stricter mail guidelines for security reasons.

There have been several notable challenges to prison corresponding services. The [[Missouri Department of Corrections]] (DOC) stated that effective June 1, 2007, inmates would be prohibited from using [[pen pal]] websites, citing concerns that inmates were using them to solicit money and defraud the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1232308661.html DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS TO BAN INMATES FROM SOLICITING PEN PALS ON WEBSITES] – Missouri Department of Corrections, press release May 13, 2007. "''During our review, we have identified numerous offenders who, through misleading web postings and photos, have solicited thousands of dollars from individuals and have devised other creative and purposeful intents to defraud the public''"&lt;/ref&gt; Service providers such as [[WriteAPrisoner.com]], together with the [[ACLU]], plan to challenge the ban in Federal Court. Similar bans on an inmate's rights or a website's right to post such information has been ruled unconstitutional in other courts, citing First Amendment freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/12/56880|publisher=[[Wired News]]|title=Arizona Inmates Back on the Net|accessdate=2008-01-26|date=December 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some faith-based initiatives promote the positive effects of correspondence on inmates, and some have made efforts to help ex-offenders reintegrate into society through job placement assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-579221|title=Employment Upon Release|accessdate=2011-03-28|author=Neal Moore|publisher=CNN|date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates' ability to mail letters to other inmates has been limited by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sol.lp.findlaw.com/2000/shaw.html|title=Prisoners' Rights – Legal Correspondence|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmate correspondence with members of society is typically encouraged because of the positive impact it can have on inmates, albeit under the guidelines of each institution and availability of letter writers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Also identified as an issue within the prison system is gang violence, because many gang members retain their gang identity and affiliations when imprisoned. Segregation of identified gang members from the general population of inmates, with different [[Gangs in the United States|gangs]] being housed in separate units often results in the imprisonment of these gang members with their friends and criminal cohorts. Some feel this has the effect of turning prisons into "institutions of higher criminal learning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/gangs/|title=Gang and Security Threat Group Awareness|publisher=Florida Department of Corrections|accessdate=2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They do this by placing hundreds of bunk beds next to one another, in these gyms, without any type of barriers to keep inmates separated.

Prior to the 1980s, private prisons did not exist in the U.S. During the 1980s, as a result of the [[War on Drugs]] by the [[Reagan Administration]], the number of people incarcerated rose. This created a demand for more prison space. The result was the development of [[privatization]] and the for-profit prison industry.&lt;ref&gt;Khalek, Rania.

A 1998 study was performed using three comparable [[Louisiana]] medium security prisons, two of which were privately run by different corporations and one of which was publicly run. The data from this study suggested that the privately run prisons operated more cost-effectively without sacrificing the safety of inmates and staff. The study concluded that both privately run prisons had a lower cost per inmate, a lower rate of critical incidents, a safer environment for employees and inmates, and a higher proportional rate of inmates who completed basic education, literacy, and vocational training courses. However, the publicly run prison outperformed the privately run prisons in areas such as experiencing fewer escape attempts, controlling substance abuse through testing, offering a wider range of educational and vocational courses, and providing a broader range of treatment, recreation, social services, and rehabilitative services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Archambeault|first=William G.|author2=Donald R.

According to [[Marie Gottschalk]], a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, studies that claim private prisons are cheaper to run than public prisons fail to "take into account the fundamental differences between private and public facilities," and that the prison industry "engages in a lot of cherry-picking and cost-shifting to maintain the illusion that the private sector does it better for less."&lt;ref&gt;Marie Gottschalk.

Within three years of being released, 67% of ex-prisoners re-offend and 52% are re-incarcerated, according to a study published in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vera.org/publications/confronting-confinement |title=Confronting Confinement |author=John J. Gibbons and Nicholas de B. Katzenbach |date = June 2006|publisher=Vera Institute of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langan" /&gt; The rate of recidivism is so high in the United States that most inmates who enter the system are likely to reenter within a year of their release.{{Citation needed|reason=Langan and Levin state that ::Within a year of release from prison, 44.1% of prisoners were rearrested:: that's not most|date=November 2018}} Former inmate Wenona Thompson argues "I realized that I became part of a cycle, a system, that looked forward to seeing me there. And I was aware that...I would be one of those people who fill up their prisons".&lt;ref name="Lyons"&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Lyons|first=John|title=War on the Family: Mothers in Prison and the Children They Leave Behind|medium=DVD|publisher=Peace Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the government allocated $5.1 billion for new prison space. Every $100 million spent in construction costs $53 million per year in finance and operational costs over the next three decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alexander |first=Elizabeth |title=A Troubling Response To Overcrowded Prisons |journal=Civil Rights Journal |date=Fall 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taxpayers spend $60 billion a year for prisons. In 2005, it cost an average of $23,876 a year to house a prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_8400051 |work=Denver Post |first=N.C. |last=Aizenman |title=The high cost of incarceration |date=February 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes about $30,000 per year per person to provide [[drug rehabilitation]] treatment to inmates. By contrast, the cost of drug rehabilitation treatment outside of a prison costs about $8,000 per year per person.&lt;ref name="Lyons"/&gt;

The effects of such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, a person who has been recently released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. They are not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 they have to wait two years before they can apply. In addition to finding housing, they also have to find employment, but this can be difficult as employers often check for a potential employees [[Criminal record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.careerbuilder.com/advice/majority-of-employers-background-check-employees | title=Majority of employers background check employees … Here's why}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, a person who has been recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome them back.&lt;ref name="Lyons"/&gt;

In ''[[The New Jim Crow]]'' in 2011, legal scholar and advocate [[Michelle Alexander]] contended that the U.S. incarceration system worked to bar black men from voting. She wrote "there are more African Americans under correctional control -- in prison or jail, on probation or parole -- than were enslaved in 1850, a decade before the Civil War began".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_new_jim_crow |author=Michelle Alexander |title=How mass incarceration turns people of color into permanent second-class citizens |journal=The American Prospect |date=2010-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's work has drawn increased attention through 2011 and into 2013.

Yale Law Professor, and opponent of mass incarceration [[James Forman Jr.]] has countered that 1) African Americans, as represented by such cities as the District of Columbia, have generally supported [[Law and order (politics)|tough on crime policies]]. 2) There appears to be a connection between drugs and violent crimes, the discussion of which, he says, New Jim Crow theorists have avoided. 3) New theorists have overlooked class as a factor in incarceration. Blacks with advanced degrees have fewer convictions. Blacks without advanced education have more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lifesentencesblog.com/?p=5017 |title=The "New Jim Crow" Reconsidered |accessdate=November 8, 2014 |author=Michael O'Hear |authorlink= |date=November 8, 2014 |month= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of parental incarceration on children ===

Incarceration of an individual does not have a singular effect: it affects those in the individual's tight-knit circle as well. For every mother that is incarcerated in the United States there are about another ten people (children, grandparents, community, etc.) that are directly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War on the family : mothers in prison and the families they leave behind|last=Renny.|first=Golden,|isbn=9781135939700|location=New York|oclc=861692996|date = 2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, more than 2.7 million children in the United States have an incarcerated parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cochran|first=Joshua C.|last2=Siennick|first2=Sonja E.|last3=Mears|first3=Daniel P.|date=April 2018|title=Social Exclusion and Parental Incarceration Impacts on Adolescents' Networks and School Engagement|journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family|volume=80|issue=2|pages=478–498|doi=10.1111/jomf.12464|issn=0022-2445|pmc=5880045|pmid=29622839}}&lt;/ref&gt; That translates to one out of every 27 children in the United States having an incarcerated parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.childstats.gov/americaschildren/tables/pop1.asp|title=POP1 Child population: Number of children (in millions) ages 0–17 in the United States by age, 1950–2017 and projected 2018–2050|website=www.childstats.gov|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This ripple effect on the individual's family amplifies the debilitating effect that entails arresting individuals. Given the general vulnerability and naivete of children, it is important to understand how such a traumatic event adversely affects children. The effects of a parent’s incarceration on their children have been found as early as three years old. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geller|first=Amanda|last2=Garfinkel|first2=Irwin|last3=Cooper|first3=Carey E.|last4=Mincy|first4=Ronald B.|date=2009-12-01|title=Parental Incarceration and Child Wellbeing: Implications for Urban Families|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=90|issue=5|pages=1186–1202|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00653.x|issn=0038-4941|pmc=2835345|pmid=20228880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local and state governments in the [[United States]] have recognized these harmful effects and have attempted to address them through public policy solutions.

====Health and behavioral effects====

The effects of an early traumatic experience of a child can be categorized into health effects and behavioral externalizations. Many studies have searched for a correlation between witnessing a parent's arrest and a wide variety of physiological issues. For example, Lee et al. showed significant correlation between high [[cholesterol]], [[Migraine]], and [[HIV/AIDS]] diagnosis to children with a parental incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Rosalyn D.|last2=Fang|first2=Xiangming|last3=Luo|first3=Feijun|date=April 2013|title=The impact of parental incarceration on the physical and mental health of young adults|journal=Pediatrics|volume=131|issue=4|pages=e1188–1195|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-0627|issn=1098-4275|pmc=3608482|pmid=23509174}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even while adjusting for various socioeconomic and racial factors, children with an incarcerated parent have a significantly higher chance of developing a wide variety of physical problems such as [[Obesity]], [[asthma]], and developmental delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turney|first=Kristin|date=September 2014|title=Stress proliferation across generations? Examining the relationship between parental incarceration and childhood health|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=55|issue=3|pages=302–319|doi=10.1177/0022146514544173|issn=2150-6000|pmid=25138199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current literature acknowledges that there are a variety of poor health outcomes as a direct result of being separated from a parent by [[law enforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geller|first=Amanda|last2=Cooper|first2=Carey E.|last3=Garfinkel|first3=Irwin|last4=Schwartz-Soicher|first4=Ofira|last5=Mincy|first5=Ronald B.|date=February 2012|title=Beyond absenteeism: father incarceration and child development|journal=Demography|volume=49|issue=1|pages=49–76|doi=10.1007/s13524-011-0081-9|issn=0070-3370|pmc=3703506|pmid=22203452}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is hypothesized that the chronic stress that results directly from the uncertainty of the parent's legal status is the primary influence for the extensive list of acute and chronic conditions that could develop later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garner|first=Andrew S.|last2=Shonkoff|first2=Jack P.|last3=Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health|last4=Committee on Early Childhood, Adoption, and Dependent Care|last5=Section on Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics|date=January 2012|title=Early childhood adversity, toxic stress, and the role of the pediatrician: translating developmental science into lifelong health|journal=Pediatrics|volume=129|issue=1|pages=e224–231|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-2662|issn=1098-4275|pmid=22201148}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the chronic stress, the immediate instability in a child's life deprives them of certain essentials e.g. money for food, parental love that are compulsory for leading a healthy life. Though most of the adverse effects that result from parental incarceration are regardless of whether the mother or father was arrested, some differences have been discovered. For example, males whose father have been incarcerated display more behavioral issues than any other combination of parent/child. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There has also been a substantial effort to understand how this traumatic experience manifests in the child's mental health and to identify externalizations that may be helpful for a diagnosis. The most prominent mental health outcomes in these children are [[Anxiety disorder]], [[Depression (mood)]], and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]](PTSD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Joseph|last2=Murray|first2=Lynne|date=July 2010|title=Parental incarceration, attachment and child psychopathology|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|volume=12|issue=4|pages=289–309|doi=10.1080/14751790903416889|issn=1469-2988|pmid=20582842}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poehlmann|first=Julie|date=September 2005|title=Incarcerated mothers' contact with children, perceived family relationships, and depressive symptoms|journal=Journal of Family Psychology: JFP: Journal of the Division of Family Psychology of the American Psychological Association (Division 43)|volume=19|issue=3|pages=350–357|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.19.3.350|issn=0893-3200|pmid=16221015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These problems worsen in a typical [[positive feedback]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;loop without the presence of a parental figure. Given the chronic nature of these diseases, they can be detected and observed at distinct points in a child's development, allowing for ample research. Murray et al. have been able to isolate the cause of the expression of [[Anti-social behaviour]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s specific to the parental incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Joseph|last2=Farrington|first2=David P.|last3=Sekol|first3=Ivana|date=March 2012|title=Children's antisocial behavior, mental health, drug use, and educational performance after parental incarceration: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=138|issue=2|pages=175–210|doi=10.1037/a0026407|issn=1939-1455|pmc=3283435|pmid=22229730}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a specific case study in Boston by Sack, within two months of the father being arrested, the adolescent boy in the family developed severe aggressive and antisocial behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sack|first=W. H.|date=May 1977|title=Children of imprisoned fathers|journal=Psychiatry|volume=40|issue=2|pages=163–174|issn=0033-2747|pmid=870921}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This observation is not unique; Sack and other researchers have noticed an immediate and strong reaction to sudden departures from family structure norms. These behavioral externalizations are most evident at school when the child interacts with peers and adults. This behavior leads to punishment and less focus on education, which has obvious consequences for future educational and career prospects. &lt;ref&gt;Petsch, P., &amp; Rochlen, A. B. (2009). Children of Incarcerated Parents: Implications for School Counselors. ''Journal of School Counseling'', ''7''(40), n40.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to externalizing undesirable behaviors, children of incarcerated parents are more likely to be incarcerated compared to those without incarcerated parents. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~agaulke/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/threestrikes_edited-3.pdf|title=Intergenerational Effects of Mass Incarceration|last=Dacass|first=Tennecia|date=July 25, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More formally, transmission of severe emotional strain on a parent negatively impacts the children by disrupting the home environment. Societal stigma against individuals, specifically parents, who are incarcerated is passed down to their children. The children find this stigma to be overwhelming and it negatively impacts their short- and long-term prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Marcus|date=2016-12|title=The racial implications of the effects of parental incarceration on intergenerational mobility|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/soc4.12440|journal=Sociology Compass|language=en|volume=10|issue=12|pages=1102–1109|doi=10.1111/soc4.12440|issn=1751-9020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Policy solutions====

There are four main phases that can be distinguished in the process of arresting a parent: [[arrest]], [[sentencing]], incarceration, and re-entry. Re-entry is not relevant if a parent is not arrested for other crimes. During each of these phases, solutions can be implemented that mitigate the harm placed on the children during the process. While their parents are away, children rely on other caretakers (family or friends) to satisfy their basic need. Solutions for the children of incarcerated parents have identified caretakers as a focal point for successful intervention.

===== Arrest Phase =====
[[File:Secret Service agent trainees practice executing a search warrant.jpg|thumb|Forced home entry is a primary stressor for children in a residence.]]
One in five children witness their parent arrested by authorities, and a study interviewing 30 children reported that the children experienced [[Flashbulb Memories]] and [[Nightmare]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s associated with the day their parent was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children of incarcerated parents|date=1995|publisher=Lexington Books|others=Gabel, Katherine., Johnston, Denise, 1947-|isbn=978-0029110423|location=New York|oclc=31739788}}&lt;/ref&gt; These single, adverse moments have long-reaching effects and policymakers around the country have attempted to ameliorate the situation. For example, the city of [[San Francisco]] in 2005 implemented training policies for its police officers with the goal of making them more cognizant of the familial situation before entering the home. The guidelines go a step further and stipulate that if no information is available before the arrest, that officers ask the suspect about the possibility of any children in the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/53721/2000256-Children-of-Incarcerated-Parents-Framework-Document.pdf|title=Children of Incarcerated Parents Framework Document|last=Peterson|first=Bryce|date=June 2015|website=Urban Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco is not alone: [[New Mexico]] passed a law in 2009 advocating for child safety during parental arrest and [[California]] provides funding to agencies to train personnel how to appropriately conduct an arrest in the presence of family members.&lt;ref&gt;N.M. Stat. Ann. §29-7-7.3&lt;/ref&gt; Extending past the state level, the Department of Justice has provided guidelines for police officers around the country to better accommodate for children in difficult family situations. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bja.gov/Publications/IACP-SafeguardingChildren.pdf|title=Safeguarding Children of Arrested Parents|last=|first=|date=|website=Bureau of Justice Assistance|archive-url=https://www.bja.gov/Publications/IACP-SafeguardingChildren.pdf|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===== Sentencing Phase =====

During the sentencing phase, the judge is the primary authority in determine if the appropriate punishment, if any. Consideration of the sentencing effects on the defendant’s children could help with the preservation of the parent-child relationship. In a law passed in 2014, [[Oklahoma]] requires judges to inquire if convicted individuals are single custodial parents, and if so, authorize the mobility of important resources so the child’s transition to different circumstances is monitored.&lt;ref&gt;Okla. Stat. tit. 22, §22-20&lt;/ref&gt; The distance that the jail or prison is from the arrested individual’s home is a contributing factor to the parent-child relationship. Allowing a parent to serve their sentence closer to their residence will allow for easier visitation and a healthier relationship. Recognizing this, the New York Senate passed a bill in 2015 that would ensure convicted individuals be jailed in the nearest facility.

===== Incarceration Phase =====
While serving a sentence, measures have been put in place to allow parents to exercise their duty as role models and caretakers. The state of [[New York (state)]] allows newborns to be with their mothers for up to one year.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Corrections Law §611&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that parental, specifically maternal, presence during a newborn’s early development are crucial to both physical and cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winston|first=Robert|last2=Chicot|first2=Rebecca|date=2016|title=The importance of early bonding on the long-term mental health and resilience of children|journal=London Journal of Primary Care|volume=8|issue=1|pages=12–14|doi=10.1080/17571472.2015.1133012|issn=1757-1472|pmc=5330336|pmid=28250823}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ohio]] law requires nursery support for pregnant inmates in its facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5120.65&lt;/ref&gt; California also has a stake in the support of incarcerated parents, too, through its requirement that women in jail with children be transferred to a community facility that can provide pediatric care.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Penal Code §§3410-3424&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations are supported by the research on early child development that argue it is imperative that infants and young children are with a parental figure, preferably the mother, to ensure proper development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://childtrauma.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bonding_13.pdf|title=Bonding and Attachment in Maltreated Children|last=Perry|first=Bruce|date=2013|website=The ChildTrauma Academy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach received support at the federal level when then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates instituted several family-friendly measures, for certain facilities, including: improving infrastructure for video conferencing and informing inmates on how to contact their children if they were placed in the foster care system, among other improvements. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/deputy-attorney-general-sally-q-yates-announces-family-friendly-prison-policies-strengthen|title=Deputy Attorney General Sally Q.

===== Re-entry Phase =====
The last phase of the incarceration process is re-entry back into the community, but more importantly, back into the family structure. Though the time away is painful for the family, it does not always welcome back the previously incarcerated individual with open arms.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Naser|first=Rebecca L.|last2=La Vigne|first2=Nancy G.|date=March 2006|title=Family Support in the Prisoner Reentry Process|journal=Journal of Offender Rehabilitation|language=en|volume=43|issue=1|pages=93–106|doi=10.1300/j076v43n01_05|issn=1050-9674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is the transition into the family difficult, but also into society as they are faced with establishing secure housing, insurance, and a new job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Serin|first=Ralph C.|last2=Lloyd|first2=Caleb D.|last3=Hanby|first3=Laura J.|date=August 2010|title=Enhancing Offender Re-Entry an Integrated Model for Enhancing Offender Re-Entry|journal=European Journal of Probation|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=53–75|doi=10.1177/206622031000200205|issn=2066-2203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, policymakers find it necessary to ease the transition of an incarcerated individual to the pre-arrest situation. Of the four outlined phases, re-entry is the least emphasized from a public policy perspective. This is not to say it is the least important, however, as there are concerns that time in a correctional facility can deteriorate the caretaking ability of some prisoners. As a result, Oklahoma has taken measurable strides by providing parents with the tools they need to re-enter their families, including classes on parenting skills.&lt;ref&gt;2007 Okla. Sess. Laws, Chap. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Caretakers =====
[[File:Grandmother and grandchild.jpg|thumb|159x159px|Grandmothers are a common caregiver of children with an incarcerated parent]]
Though the effects on caregivers of these children vary based on factors such as the relationship to the prisoner and his or her support system, it is well-known that it is a financial and emotional burden to take care of a child. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2012.00283.x|title = The Collateral Consequences of Incarceration Revisited: A Qualitative Analysis of the Effects on Caregivers of Children of Incarcerated Parents| journal=Criminology| volume=50| issue=4| pages=913–959|year = 2012|last1 = Turanovic|first1 = Jillian J.| last2=Rodriguez| first2=Nancy| last3=Pratt| first3=Travis C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;In addition to taking care of the their [[nuclear family]], caregivers are now responsible for another individual who requires attention and resources to flourish. Depending on the relationship to the caregiver, the transition to a new household may not be easy for the child. The rationale behind targeting caregivers for intervention policies is to ensure the new environment for the children is healthy and productive. The federal government funds  states to provide counseling to caretaking family members to alleviate some of the associated emotional burden. A more comprehensive program from [[Washington (state)]] employs "kinship navigators" to address caretakers' needs with initiatives such as parental classes and connections to legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2016/05/24/having-a-parent-behind-bars-costs-children-states|title=Having a Parent Behind Bars Costs Children, States|website=www.pewtrusts.org|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on employment ===
Felony records greatly influence the chances of people finding employment. Many employers seem to use criminal history as a screening mechanism without attempting to probe deeper.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pager|first=Devah|date=March 2003|title=The Mark of a Criminal Record|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/pager/files/pager_ajs.pdf|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=108|issue=5|pages=937–975|doi=10.1086/374403}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often more interested in incarceration as a measure of employability and trustworthiness instead of its relation to any specific job.&lt;ref name="press.uchicago.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/644839.html|title=Marked: Race, Crime, and Finding Work in an Era of Mass Incarceration by Devah Pager, an excerpt|website=press.uchicago.edu|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have felony records have a harder time finding a job.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Western|first=Bruce|date=August 2002|title=The Impact of Incarceration on Wage Mobility and Inequality|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/brucewestern/files/western_asr.pdf|journal=American Sociology Review|volume=67|issue=4|pages=526–546|doi=10.2307/3088944|jstor=3088944}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological effects of incarceration can also impede an ex-felon's search for employment. Prison can cause social anxiety, distrust, and other psychological issues that negatively affect a person's reintegration into an employment setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/psychological-impact-incarceration-implications-post-prison-adjustment|title=The Psychological Impact of Incarceration: Implications for Post-Prison Adjustment|date=2015-11-23|work=ASPE|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Men who are unemployed are more likely to participate in crime &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which leads to there being a 67% chance of ex-felons being charged again.&lt;ref name="press.uchicago.edu"/&gt; In 2008, the difficulties male ex-felons in the United States had finding employment lead to approximately a 1.6% decrease in the employment rate alone. This is a loss of between $57 and $65 billion of output to the US economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://cepr.net/documents/publications/ex-offenders-2010-11.pdf|title=Ex-Offenders and the Labor Market|last=Schmitt|first=John|last2=Warner|first2=Kris|publisher=Center for Economic and Policy Research|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although incarceration in general has a huge effect on employment, the effects become even more pronounced when looking at race. Devah Pager performed a study in 2003 and found that white males with no criminal record had a 34% chance of callback compared to 17% for white males with a criminal record. Black males with no criminal record were called back at a rate of 14% while the rate dropped to 5% for those with a criminal record. Black men with no criminal background have a harder time finding employment than white men who have a history of criminal activity. While having a criminal record decreases the chance of a callback for white men by 50%, it decreases the callback chances for black men by 64%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While Pager's study is greatly informative, it does lack some valuable information. Pager only studied white and black males, which leaves out women and people of other races. It also fails to account for the fact that applying for jobs has largely shifted from applying in person to applying over the Internet. A study done by Scott H. Decker, Cassia Spohn, Natalie R. Ortiz, and Eric Hedberg from Arizona State University in 2014 accounts for this missing information. This study was set up similarly to the Pager study, but with the addition of female job applicants, Hispanic job applicants, and online job applications.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/244756.pdf|title=Criminal Stigma, Race, Gender, and Employment: An Expanded Assessment of the Consequences of Imprisonment for Employment|last=Decker|first=Scott|last2=Spohn|first2=Cassia|last3=Ortiz|first3=Natalie|last4=Hedberg|first4=Eric|publisher=National Institute of Justice|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women of white, black, and Hispanic ethnicities account for 92% of the US prison population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p13.pdf|title=Prisoners in 2013|last=Carson|first=E.

The results of Arizona State University study were somewhat different from Pager's study, but the main finding was expected: Incarceration decreased the chances of getting employed. For females submitting applications online and in-person, regardless of criminal history, white women received the most amount of callbacks, roughly 40%. Hispanic women followed up with a 34% callback rate. Black women had the lowest rate at 27%. The effects of incarceration on female applicants in general were that females with a prison record were less likely to receive a callback compared to females without a prison record. The significant exceptions are white women applying in person and Hispanic women with a community college degree applying online.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

For males submitting applications online and in-person, regardless of criminal history, Hispanic males received the most amount of callbacks, roughly 38%. White males followed up with a 35% callback rate. Black males had the lowest rate at 27%. The effects of incarceration on male applicants applying in-person was that males with a prison record were less likely than males without a prison record to receive a callback. However, the effects of incarceration on male applicants applying online were nearly nonexistent. In fact, the study found that "there was no effect of race/ethnicity, prison record, or community college [education] on men's success in advancing through the [online] hiring process". The Arizona State University study also had results that contradicted Pager's study. It found that white males with a prison record did not have a higher callback rate than black males (and Hispanic males) without a prison record. Hispanic men without a prison record had a 40% higher callback rate than white males with a prison record, and black men without a prison record had a 6% higher callback rate than white males without a prison record.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Proposed solutions===
Mass incarceration cannot be remedied in a short length of time, because each prisoner serves a separate sentence, the average length of sentences has risen over the last 35 years and public support for [[prison reform]] is still relatively low. Decriminalizing drugs has been suggested by libertarians and advocated for by socialists, but remains a remote political option. Additional parole and probation can be facilitated with enhanced electronic monitoring, though monitoring is expensive. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld prisoner releases to relieve California's unconstitutional prison conditions in ''Brown v. Plata,'' long-standing litigation wherein the federal courts intervened as they have done in most states through the years.

There is also the [[Prison abolition movement]] which calls for the immediate elimination and reduction of both public and private prisons. [[Angela Davis]] is a popular advocate for the prison abolition movement and has outlined how organizations like [[G4S]], the third largest private corporation just behind McDonald's and Foxconn, make a huge profit from privatized prisons across the globe. Socialists have been a major advocate for abolition of prisons and argues that capitalism has led to the creation of prisons as well as mass-incarceration by pointing to G4S which profits from locking up other people behind bars and segregating lands in other countries, as well as enforcing borders and deporting immigrants. Angela Davis explains many of these views and how to implement reforms based on rehabilitation over incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freedom is a Constant Struggle|last=Davis|first=Angela|publisher=Haymarket Books|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== References in popular culture ==
In relation to [[popular culture]], mass incarceration has become a popular issue in the [[Hip hop|Hip-Hop]] community. Artists like [[Tupac Shakur]], [[N.W.A|NWA]], [[LL Cool J]], and [[Kendrick Lamar]] have written songs and poems that condemn racial disparities in the criminal justice system, specifically the practice of police officers targeting African Americans. By presenting the negative implications of mass incarceration in a way that is widespread throughout popular culture, [[rap music]] is more likely to impact younger generations than a book or scholarly article would. Hip hop accounts of mass incarceration are based on victim-based testimony and are effective in inspiring others to speak out against the corrupt criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tibbs|first=Donald F.|date=Fall 2015|title=HIP HOP AND THE NEW JIM CROW: RAP MUSIC'S INSIGHT ON MASS INCARCERATION|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=598ea7e1-d5c0-4aa3-b3a2-e43c9382e24a%40sessionmgr120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=115790483&amp;db=a9h|journal=University of Maryland Law Journal of Race, Religion, Gender &amp; Class|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to references in popular music, mass incarceration has also played a role in modern film. For example, Ava [[Ava DuVernay|DuVernay's]] Netflix film ''[[13th (film)|13th]],'' released in 2017, criticizes mass incarceration and compares it to the history of slavery throughout the United States, beginning with the provision of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] that allows for involuntary servitude "as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted." The film delivers the staggering message that mass incarceration could be equated to the post-Civil War Jim Crow Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/10/06/ava-duvernays-netflix-film-13th-reveals-how-mass-incarceration-is-an-extension-of-slavery/|title=Ava DuVernay's Netflix film '13th' reveals how mass incarceration is an extension of slavery|last=Butler|first=Bethonie|date=October 6, 2016|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fight against mass incarceration has also been a part of the larger discourse in the 21st century movement for Black Lives. [[Black Lives Matter|#BlackLivesMatter]], a progressive movement created by [[Alicia Garza]] after the death of [[Trayvon Martin]], was designed as an online platform to fight against anti-black sentiments such as mass incarceration, [[police brutality]], and ingrained racism within modern society. According to Garza, "Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise.  It is an affirmation of Black folks' contributions to this society, our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression." This movement has focused on specific racial issues faced by African Americans in the justice system including police brutality, ending capital punishment, and eliminating "the criminalization and dehumanization of Black youth across all areas of society." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/10/blacklivesmatter-2/|title=A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement by Alicia Garza|last=Garza|first=Alicia|date=October 7, 2014|website=The Feminist Wire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1373">Funded by the [[National Science Foundation]], the '''Innovative Technology Experiences for Students''' and Teachers (ITEST) program was established in 2003 to address the looming shortage of technology workers in the United States. ITEST engages students and teachers in authentic, hands-on learning experiences in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (commonly referred to as '[[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]]' or 'SET' [more common in the U.K.]).

As of early 2012, the program is in its ninth year. Over 195 individual projects across 43 states have been funded. It has impacted:
* over 225,800 students, grades 6-12
* over 8,000 teachers
* over 3,000 parents and caregivers

The ITEST Learning Resource Center (ITEST LRC) at [[Education Development Center]] assists the projects in building bridges between formal and informal learning by facilitating an inclusive community of practice. Findings and lessons learned are shared nationally to improve policy and practice. Visit the website with the link below, or view a 2-page overview (Snapshot).

'''Intonjane''' is a [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] [[rite of passage]] into womanhood practiced in the [[Eastern Cape]] of [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Laura Cloete. BOTH SIDES OF THE CAMERA: ANTHROPOLOGY AND VIDEO: THE STUDY OF. A GCALEKA WOMEN'S RITE CALLED INTONJANE.https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/39675529.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The ritual takes place after a girl has had her [[Menarche|first period]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This ritual is symbolic of a girl’s [[sexual maturity]] and ability to [[Fertilisation|conceive]]. It is through this ritual that girls are taught about socially accepted behaviours of Xhosa women,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; while also encouraging them not to have sex before [[marriage]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;SIZIWE SYLVIA SOTEWU.2016.A visual narrative reflecting on upbringing of Xhosa girls with special reference to ‘intonjane’.http://uir.unisa.ac.za/handle/10500/22192.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The origins of the name ''intonjane'' is associated with the life cycle of a stick insect.{{which|date=January 2018}} At the end of its larval stage, [[caterpillar]]s encase themselves in a little grass-like mat [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] where till it is ready to emerge as an adult. During these months, trees have these grassy cocoons that Xhosa people refer to as ''ntonjane''. The kind of grass that the girl sits on during the ritual, called [[inxkopho]], bears a resemblance to the cocoons encasing of the caterpillars on the tree, hence the name ''intonjane''. The intonjane ritual takes three to six weeks, and several events take place during that period.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Umngeno==

When the girl has had her first [[menstruation]], she notifies her mother, who in turn informs her father, who then calls on a traditional gathering called ibhunga. [[Jewellery]] made from grass is placed around her neck and waist as a symbol of her coming to age.
The ''ibhunga'' gathering is marked by the making of ''umqombothi webhunga'' (traditional [[beer]]). It is during this event that the girl is informed that she is going to attend the ''intonjane'' ceremony. She then wears a [[necklace]] made from a string of a live [[ox]]’s tail hair, referred to as ''ubulunga''. The necklace is a symbol of fertility and that the girl is ready to accept marriage proposals.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

It is then that the girl goes into seclusion with ''amakhankatha'' (assistants) and her aunt. This seclusion is referred to as ''umngeno'' as it is the day that the initiate goes into isolation. The first week is marked by the initiate being placed behind a curtain without any of her clothes, apart from a black [[doek]], and inkciyo,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; a beaded skirt that serves as a garment covering the [[pubic area]].&lt;ref&gt;RH Kaschula, B Dlutu. Reinventing the Oral Word and Returning It to the Community viaTechnauriture.https://books.google.co.za/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6IpwCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA377&amp;dq=Inkciyo&amp;ots=x7eWAC-Y6_&amp;sig=rcM1_IZEG00DJyjBu2PnS_uSgdM#v=onepage&amp;q=Inkciyo&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;   Her body is painted with white [[ochre]], representing contact with the [[ancestral spirits]] and seclusion from tribal life.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Umngenandlini==

After the first or second evening, a [[goat]] is slaughtered by the father or the men of the family. After slaughtering the goat, a young man is selected to roast a piece of meat called ‘isiphika’. Once the meat is roasted, a sharpened stick is used to pick it up and the meat is given to the initiate, who is not allowed to eat it using her hands. Her assistants are not allowed to eat it with their hands.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Umtshato==

After ''umngenandlini'', on the fourth day or any even numbered day after the seclusion of the initiate, a ceremony that simulates a marriage ceremony is held. The reason why ''umtshato'' must be held on an even numbered day is that the even number is symbolic of two families in a marriage union.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

This ritual is marked by the slaughtering of an ox, the right shoulder of the ox, called ''umshwamo'', is placed into the chosen special hut from the girl's [[wikt:homestead|homestead]] for the night. The following day, one of ''amakhankatha'' cooks the meat and the meat is eaten using the same stick that was used when eating the goat meat from umngenandlini. This ritual is a three-day celebration where the public is witness to the girl’s new role as woman.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Ukutsiba Intaba==

This is an event  marked by the disposal of the initiate’s sanitary towels or whatever she used during her period. It is after the disposal that the girl and her ''amakhankatha''  must burn the stick that they have been using to eat the meat. The initiate and her assistants look for a place to burn the stick. Then one of her assistants ties the stick to the bunch of grass they have chosen to use as [[tinder]] and burns it. After the fire, the initiate and her assistants disperse the ashes everywhere. This is symbolic of the ending of the initiate’s childhood stage and the beginning of her journey into womanhood. After dispersing of the ashes, the girls run home. However, the initiate must run fast and be ahead of her assistants because if they catch up to her, she will have to stay in the hut for an extended period.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Umngqungqo==

Before the end of the girl’s seclusion, a party is thrown for all the women in the village. This event is referred to as ''umngqungqo''. Women are clad in bright-coloured clothing and beads during this event. In the morning after the last day of the party, the initiate goes to the river to wash the white ochre and it is replaced by the yellow one referred to as ''umdike''. The initiate and her assistants wear new clothes upon their return from the river. It is then that celebrations continue, to mark the end of the ''intonjane'' ritual.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Japanese Canadians'''|日系カナダ人|Nikkei Kanadajin|{{lang-fr|Canadiens japonais}}}} are [[Canadians|Canadian citizens]] of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] ancestry. Japanese Canadians are mostly concentrated in [[Western Canada]], especially in the province of [[British Columbia]], which hosts the largest Japanese community in the country with the majority of them living in and around [[Vancouver]]. In 2016, there were 121,485 Japanese Canadians throughout Canada .&lt;ref name="Japanese Canadians"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=1&amp;LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=0&amp;PID=105396&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=105277&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2013&amp;THEME=95&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF= |title=2011 National Household Survey: Data tables |author=[[Statistics Canada]] |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generations ==
The term [[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]] (日系) was coined by sociologists and encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations. Japanese descendents living overseas have special names for each of their generations. These are formed by combining one of the [[Japanese numerals]] with the Japanese word for [[generation]] (''sei'' 世):ada:
*[[Issei]] (一世) – The first generation of immigrants, born in Japan before moving to Canada.
*[[Nisei]] (二世) – The second generation, born in Canada to Issei parents not born in Canada.
*[[Sansei]] (三世) – The third generation, born in Canada to Nisei parents born in Canada.
*[[Yonsei (Japanese diaspora)|Yonsei]] (四世) – The fourth generation, born in Canada to Sansei parents born in Canada.
*[[Gosei (Japanese diaspora)|Gosei]] (五世) – The fifth generation, born in Canada to Yonsei parents born in Canada.

==History==
The first Japanese settler in Canada was [[Manzo Nagano]], who lived in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] in 1877 (a mountain in the province was named after him in 1977). The first generation, or [[Issei]], mostly came to [[Vancouver Island]], the [[Fraser Valley]] and [[Rivers Inlet]] from fishing villages on the islands of [[Kyūshū]] and [[Honshū]] between 1877 and 1928. Since 1967, the second wave of immigrants were usually highly educated and resided in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Adachi, ''The enemy that never was: A history of the Japanese Canadians'' (McClelland &amp; Stewart, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1948, Japanese-Canadians—both ''Issei'' and Canadian-born ''Nisei''—were denied the right to vote. Those born in the 1950s and 1960s in Canada are mostly [[Sansei]], third generation. Sansei usually have little knowledge of the [[Japanese language]]. Over 75% of the ''Sansei'' have married non-Japanese. ''Nisei'' and ''Sansei'' generally do not identify themselves as fully Japanese, but as Canadians first, who happen to be of Japanese ancestry.

The younger generation of Japanese-Canadians born in the late 20th century are mostly ''Yonsei'', fourth generation. Many ''Yonsei'' are of mixed racial descent. According to [[Statistics Canada]]'s 2001 census of population information, Japanese-Canadians were the Canadian visible minority group most likely to marry or live common-law with a non-Japanese partner. Out of the 25,100 couples in Canada in 2001 which had one Japanese person, only 30% had two partners of Japanese descent and 70% included one non-Japanese partner. As of 2001, 65% of Canada's Japanese population was born in Canada.

===Internment===
{{Main|Japanese Canadian internment}}
In 1942, the [[Politics of Canada|federal government]] used the [[War Measures Act]] to brand Japanese Canadians enemy aliens and categorized them as security threats. There were 20,881 Japanese placed in internment camps and road camps in British Columbia; prison of war camps in Ontario; and families were also sent as forced labourers to farms throughout the prairies. Three-quarters of them were Canadian [technically British subjects, as were all Canadians, since [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian citizenship]] did not exist prior to 1947]. A parallel situation occurred in the United States. (See [[Japanese American internment]].)&lt;ref&gt;Ann Gomer Sunahara, ''The politics of racism: The uprooting of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War'' (James Lorimer &amp; Co, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The property and homes of Japanese Canadians living in the province of British Columbia were seized and sold off without consent in 1943. The funds were used to pay for their internment. They also had to "pay rent" for living in the internment shacks they were assigned. In 1945, after the war, as part of the continued effort to remove all Japanese Canadians from British Columbia, Prime Minister MacKenzie King's cabinet used Orders-in-Council to extend the powers of the War Measures Act and Japanese Canadians give two "options": to either be relocated to another province, i.e. "East of the Rockies", or to go "back" to Japan (though most were born in Canada and had never been to Japan). After organized protests by against their treatment, they were finally given the right to vote in 1949. Mobility restrictions were lifted in 1949.

In the late 1970s and 1980s, documents on the Japanese Canadian internment were released, and redress was sought by the National Association of Japanese Canadians, an organization representing Japanese Canadians nationally that was headed by Art Miki from Winnipeg. In 1986, it was shown that Japanese Canadians lost $443 million during the internment. There were 63% of Canadians who supported redress and 45% who favoured individual compensation. On September 22, 1988, the National Association of Japanese Canadians succeeded in negotiating a redress settlement with the government at the time, under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]]. The settlement included $21,000 for each individual directly affected, that was, by 1993, almost 18,000 survivors. The federal government also provided a community endowment fund to assist in rebuilding the community, which is run by the National Association of Japanese Canadians. In addition, to address the more systemic racism that led to the plan and later justifications of the effort to remove "all people of Japanese racial origin" from Canadian territory, the redress settlement included the establishment of the Race Relations Foundation and challenges to the War Measures Act. The Prime Minister also offered a formal apology in the House of Commons and the certificate of acknowledgement of injustices of the past, which was sent to each Japanese Canadian whose rights had been stripped, incarcerated, dispossessed and forcibly displaced.

The '''''Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management''''' is a monthly [[scientific journal]] of [[engineering]] published by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] since 1993. The journal covers the development of methods, theories, and applications to current administrative, economic, engineering, planning, and social issues as they apply to [[water resources]] [[management]]. It publishes papers on analytical, experimental, and numerical methods with regard to the investigation of physical or conceptual models related to these issues. It also publishes technical notes, book reviews, and forum discussions. The journal requires the use of the [[metric system]], but allows for authors to also submit their papers in other systems of measure in addition to the SI system.

The current [[editor in chief]] is David W. Watkins, Jr. ([[Michigan Tech University]]).

This article presents the current [[linguistic demography|language demographics]] of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]].

==Demographic terms==
The complex nature of Quebec's linguistic situation, with individuals who are often [[multilingualism|bilingual or multilingual]], requires the use of multiple terms in order to describe the languages which people speak.
;[[Francophone]]: Speaking [[French language|French]] as a first language.
;[[English language|Anglophone]]: Speaking [[English language|English]] as a first language.
;[[Allophone (Quebec)|Allophone]]: Having a mother tongue other than English or French.
; Mother tongue : The first language learned by a person, which may or may not still be used by that individual in adulthood, is a basic measure of a population's language. However, with the high number of mixed francophone-anglophone marriages and the reality of multilingualism in Montreal, this description does not give a true linguistic portrait of Quebec. It is, however, still essential, for example in order to calculate the [[language shift|assimilation rate]]. [[Statistics Canada]] defines mother tongue as the first language learned in childhood and still spoken; it does not presuppose literacy in that or any language.
; Home language : This is the language most often spoken at home and is currently preferred to identify francophones, anglophones, and allophones. This descriptor has the advantage of pointing out the current usage of languages. However, it fails to describe the language that is most used at work, which may be different.
; Knowledge of official languages : This measure describes which of the two official languages of Canada a person can speak informally. This relies on the person's own evaluation of his/her linguistic competence and can prove misleading.
; First official language learned: Measures whether English or French is first language learned; it places allophones into English or French linguistic communities.

=== Overview as of the 2016 census ===
*Population: 8,164,361
*Official language: [[French language|French]]
*Majority group: [[Francophone]] (77.1%)
*Minority groups: [[Allophone (Quebec)|Allophone]] (13.15%), [[English language|Anglophone]] (7.45%), [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginals]] (0.6%), native speakers of two languages or more (2.3%)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=PR&amp;Code1=24&amp;Geo2=&amp;Code2=&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Quebec&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;GeoLevel=PR&amp;GeoCode=24|title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Quebec [Province] and Canada [Country]|last=|first=|date=2017-08-02|website=Statistics Canada|language=en|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the ten provinces of [[Canada]], [[Quebec]] is the only one whose majority is francophone. Quebec's population accounts for 23.9% of the Canadian population, and Quebec's francophones account for about 90% of Canada's [[French language|French]]-speaking population.

[[English-speaking Quebecer]]s are a large population in the Greater Montreal Area, where they have built a well-established network of educational, social, economic, and cultural institutions. There are also historical English-speaking communities in the [[Eastern Townships]], the [[Ottawa Valley]], the Laurentians (such as Ste. Agathe des Monts, Ste. Adolphe de Howard, Arundel, Lachute, Mont Tremblant) and the [[Gaspé Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Claude Belanger |publisher= Marionapolis College |title= Anglophone population of Quebec, Percentage of regional population, 1861–1981|accessdate=2007-03-01 |url= http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/stats/anglo1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the population of [[Quebec City]], the second-largest city in the province, is almost exclusively francophone. Overall in the province the proportion of native English speakers dropped significantly between 1951 and 2001, from 13.8%  to 8% in 2001, while it has since stabilized.

The remaining 13% of the population, known as [[Allophone (Quebec)|allophone]]s, are native speakers of more than 30 different languages. With the exception of [[Aboriginal peoples in Quebec]] (the [[Inuit]], [[Huron-Wendat Nation|Huron]],Mohawks, Iroquois, Abenaki, Montagnais, Cree, Innu, Ojibway etc.), the majority are products of recent immigration and often come to adopt either English or French as home languages.

===Numbers of native speakers===

Of the population of 7,903,001 counted by the 2011 census, 7,815,955 completed the section about language. Of these, 7,663,120 gave singular responses to the question regarding their [[first language]]. The languages most commonly reported were the following:

===Montreal===
There are today three distinct territories in the [[Greater Montreal Area]]: the metropolitan region, [[Montreal Island]], and [[Montreal]], the city. (The island and the city were coterminous for a time between the municipal merger of [[2002 in Canada|2002]] and the "demerger" which occurred in January 2006.)

Quebec allophones account for 9% of the population of Quebec. The vast majority of them (88%) reside in Greater Montreal. Anglophones are also concentrated in the region of Montreal (80% of their numbers).

Francophones account for 65% of the total population of Greater Montreal, anglophones 12.6% and allophones 20.4%. On the island of Montreal, the francophone majority dropped to 46.96% by 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CD&amp;Code1=2466&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=01&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Montreal&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=24&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom=&amp;TABID=1|title=Montréal (equivalent territory), Quebec and Canada- Census Profile. 2011 Census|last=|first=|date=2012-10-24|website=Statistics Canada|language=en|others=|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a net decline since the 1970s owing to francophone outmigration to more affluent suburbs in Laval and the South Shore (fr. ''Rive-Sud'') and an influx of allophone immigrants. The anglophones account for 16.64% of the population and the allophones 35.24%.

=== Bilingualism ===

According to the 2011 census,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/life/Census+Bilingualism+growing+Quebec+shrinking+rest+Canada/7438531/story.html|title=Census: Bilingualism growing in Quebec, shrinking in rest of Canada|last=Souza|first=,Mike De|date=2012-10-26|work=Montreal Gazette|access-date=2017-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127044018/http://www.montrealgazette.com/life/Census+Bilingualism+growing+Quebec+shrinking+rest+Canada/7438531/story.html|archive-date=2012-11-27|dead-url=yes|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rate of bilingualism (the percentage of the population that said they had knowledge of both English and French) is at 42.6 per cent in 2011, up from 40.6 per cent in 2006. (It is at 17.5 in Canada overall)

===Birth rate===
At 1.74 children per woman, Quebec's 2008 fertility rate was above the Canada-wide rate of 1.59, and had increased for five consecutive years. However, it remained below the replacement fertility rate of 2.1. This contrasts with its fertility rates before 1960, which were among the highest of any industrialized society. Although Quebec is home to only 23.9% of the population of Canada, the number of international adoptions in Quebec is the highest of all provinces of Canada. In 2001, 42% of international adoptions in Canada were carried out in Quebec.

===Immigration===
In 2003, Quebec accepted some 37,619 [[immigrant]]s. A large proportion of these immigrants originated from francophone countries and countries that are former French colonies. Countries from which significant numbers of people immigrate include [[Haiti]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]], [[Lebanon]], [[Morocco]], [[Rwanda]], [[Syria]], [[Algeria]], [[France]] and [[Belgium]]. Under the [[Canada-Quebec Accord]], Quebec has sole responsibility for selecting most immigrants destined to the province (see related article, [[Immigration to Canada]]).

Interprovincial migration, especially to Ontario, results in a net loss of population in Quebec. The numbers of French-speaking Quebecers leaving the province tend to be similar to the number entering, while immigrants to Quebec are more likely to leave.  Outmigration has most affected the English-speaking minority in Quebec, accounting for its population being significantly reduced since the 1970s.

==Legislation==
* 1988 – [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]] (Federal)
* 1982 – Articles 14, 16–23, 55 and 57 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (Federal)
* 1977 – [[Charter of the French Language]] (Provincial)
* 1974 – [[Official Language Act (Quebec)|Official Language Act]] (Provincial)
* 1969 – [[An Act to promote the French language in Quebec]] (Provincial)
* 1969 – [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]] (Federal)

There are two sets of language laws in Quebec, which overlap and in various areas conflict or compete with each other: the laws passed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] and the laws passed by the [[National Assembly of Quebec]].

Since 1982, both parliaments have had to comply with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which constitutionalized a number of fundamental human rights and educational rights of minorities in all provinces (education is a provincial jurisdiction in Canada). Prior to this, Quebec was effectively the sole province required constitutionally to finance the educational needs of its linguistic minority. Ontario and Quebec are both required to finance schools for their principal religious minorities (Roman Catholic in Ontario, Protestant in Quebec), but only in Quebec is the minority almost completely composed of speakers of the minority language. (Quebec also provided English schools for anglophone Roman Catholics.) In 1997, an amendment to the constitution allowed for Quebec to replace its system of denominational school boards with a system of linguistic school boards.

The federal language law and regulations seek to make it possible for all Canadian anglophone and francophone citizens to obtain services in the language of their choice from the federal government. Ottawa promotes the adoption of bilingualism by the population and especially among the employees in the public service.

In contrast, the Quebec language law and regulations promote French exclusively as the common public language of all Quebecers.  Although Quebec currently respects most of the constitutional rights of its anglophone minority, it took a series of court challenges to enforce. The government of Quebec promotes the adoption and the use of French and limits the presence of English. This is to counteract the trend towards the anglicization of the population of Quebec.

===Anglicization and francization===

The following table&lt;ref&gt;Charles Castonguay, ''Les indicateurs généraux de la vitalité des langues au Québec : comparabilité et tendances 1971–2001'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; shows summary data on the language shifts which have occurred in Quebec between 1971, year of the first Canadian census asking questions about home language, and 2001 :

{| class="wikitable"
|colspan=5| 1971–2001 Period
|-
! (A) Language !! (B) Speakers according to mother language !! (C) Speakers according to home language !! (D) Linguistic persistence and attraction !! (E) Linguistic vitality indicator

The second column starting on the left shows the number of native speakers of each language, the third shows the number of speakers using it at home.

The fourth column shows the difference between the number of speakers according to home language and those who speak it as mother tongue.

The fifth column shows the quotient of the division between the number of home language speakers and the native speakers.

Until the 1960s, the francophone majority of Quebec had only very weak assimilation power and, indeed, did not seek to assimilate non-francophones. Although the quantity of non-francophones adopted French throughout history, the pressure and, indeed, consensus from French-language and English-language institutions was historically towards the anglicization, not francization, of allophones in Quebec. Only a high fertility rate allowed the francophone population to keep increasing in absolute numbers in spite of assimilation and [[emigration]]. In the early 1960s, with the [[Quiet Revolution|rise of irreligion]], the [[fertility rate]] of the Quebecois began declining in a manner consistent with most Western societies, and some in Quebec's francophone majority feared the beginning of a [[Population decline|demographic collapse]]:&lt;ref&gt;Charles Castonguay, [http://www.inroadsjournal.ca/pdfs/Inroads_8_Castonguay.pdf ''Getting the facts straight on French : Reflections following the 1996 Census''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410021239/http://www.inroadsjournal.ca/pdfs/Inroads_8_Castonguay.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }}, in [http://www.inroadsjournal.ca/ Inroads Journal], volume 8, 1999, pages 61/64&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the anglophone sphere, the francophone sphere was not assimilating allophones, and lower fertility rates were therefore much more determinative.
 
Quebec's language legislation has tried to address this since the 1960s when, as part of the [[Quiet Revolution]], [[French Canadians]] chose to move away from Church domination and towards a stronger identification with state institutions as development instruments for their community. Instead of repelling non-Catholic immigrants from the French-language public school system and towards the Protestant-run English system, for instance, immigrants would now be encouraged to attend French-language schools.  The ultimate quantifiable goal of Quebec's language policy is to establish French as Quebec's common public language.

Recent census data show that goal has not been reached as successfully as hoped. After almost 30 years of enforcement of the Charter of the French Language, approximately 49% of allophone immigrants – including those who arrived before the Charter's adoption in 1977 – had assimilated to English, down from 71% in 1971, but still considerably more than anglophones' overall share of the province's population.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Castonguay, [http://www.olf.gouv.qc.ca/ressources/bibliotheque/sociolinguistique/castonguay_indicvitlngues20050526.pdf ''Les indicateurs généraux de vitalité des langues au Québec : comparabilité et tendances 1971–2001 (Étude 1)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410021230/http://www.olf.gouv.qc.ca/ressources/bibliotheque/sociolinguistique/castonguay_indicvitlngues20050526.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }}, Office québécois de la langue française, 26 mai, 2005, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; This leads some Quebecers, particularly those who support the continued role of French as the province's common public language, to question whether the policy is being implemented successfully. The phenomenon is linked to the linguistic environments which cohabit [[Montreal]] – Quebec's largest city, Canada's second-largest metropolitan area, and home to a number of communities, neighbourhoods, and even municipalities in which English is the de facto common language. The anglophone minority's capacity to assimilate allophones and even francophones has therefore compensated to a large extent for the outmigration of anglophones to other provinces and even to the United States.

A number of socio-economic factors are thought to be responsible for this reality.  They include: the historic role of the English language in Canada and the U.S.; its growing influence in the business and scientific world; the perceived advantages of learning English that result from this prominence and which are particularly appealing to allophones who have yet to make a linguistic commitment; the historic association of English with immigrant Quebecers and French with ethnic French-Canadian [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]], which plays into linguistic and identity politics; and the post-industrial clustering of anglophones into Montreal and away from regional communities{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}.  These factors go not only to allophone immigrants' direct linguistic assimilation, but also their indirect assimilation through contact with the private sector{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}.  Although the Charter of the French language makes French the official language of the workplace, the socio-economic factors cited here also often make English a requirement for employment, especially in Montreal, and to a lesser extent outside of it, notably in [[National Capital Region (Canada)|Canada's National Capital Region]], bordering Ontario, and in the Eastern Townships, particularly Sherbrooke.

The result is a largely bilingual workforce. Francophones are often compelled to learn English to find employment (particularly in the Montreal area), while anglophones in the province are pressured to do the same with French, and allophones are asked to learn both.&lt;ref&gt;Virginie Moffet, [http://www.olf.gouv.qc.ca/ressources/bibliotheque/sociolinguistique/oqlf_faslin_02_20060606.pdf ''Langue du travail : indicateurs relatifs à l’évolution de la population active et à l’utilisation des langues au travail en 2001''], Office québécois de la langue française, page 57&lt;/ref&gt; Census data adjusted for education and professional experience show that bilingual francophones had a greater income than bilingual anglophones by the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/business/story.html?id=ff07b398-0832-4331-b12b-d32aa078edf7&amp;k=87430&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, 29% of Quebec workers declared using English, either solely (193,320), mostly (293,320), equally with French (212,545) or regularly (857,420). The proportion rose to 37% in the Montreal metropolitan area, where bilingualism is common. Outside Montreal, on the other hand, the proportion of anglophones has shrunk to 3% of the population and, except on the Ontario and U.S. borders, struggles to maintain a critical mass to support educational and health institutions – a reality that only immigrants and francophones usually experience in the other provinces. Unilingual anglophones are however still on the decline because of the higher English-French bilingualism of the community's younger generations.

For example, a more refined analysis of the Census data&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"/&gt; shows that a great deal of anglicization continues to occur in the communities traditionally associated with the English-language group, e.g., the Chinese, Italian, Greek and Indo-Pakistani groups{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. Nevertheless, a majority of new immigrants in every census since 1971 have chosen French more often than English as their adopted language. Statistics Canada's 2011 National Household Survey of Canada reported that for the first time in modern history, the first official language of more than half of Quebec immigrants was French.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/French+gains+ground+among+newcomers/8357411/story.html|title=French Gains Ground Among Newcomers|last=Scott|first=Marian|website=Montreal Gazette|archive-url=http://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20130509/281590943076468|archive-date=9 May 2013|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who spoke French as their first official language formed 51.1% of all immigrants to the province, while an additional 16.3% spoke both French and English; among those who immigrated to the province between 2006 and 2011, the proportion who spoke French as their first official language was 58.8%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Aboriginal peoples==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2007}}
[[Aboriginal peoples in Quebec]] are a heterogeneous group of about 71,000 individuals, who account for 9% of the total population of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]].  Approximately 60% of those are officially recognized as "Indians" under the federal [[Indian Act (Canada)|Indian Act]]. Nearly half (47%) of this population in Quebec reported an [[Native American languages|Aboriginal language]] as mother tongue, the highest proportion of any province. The following table&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aboriginal Peoples in Quebec |url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/qc/aqc/pop_e.html |accessdate=2008-06-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226055650/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/qc/aqc/pop_e.html |archivedate=2008-02-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the demographic situations of Aboriginal peoples in Quebec:

{{China divisions by}}
The list below outlines the distribution of the [[nationalities of China]] among [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|provinces and province-level entities]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (P.R.C.) according to the census of 2000. The provinces and province-level entities are listed by region. The classification of ethnic groups follows the official classification of the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]].

Some ethnic groups, for instance, [[Mosuo]] people, although classified as [[Nakhi]], do not regard themselves as part of any of the 56 groups identified by the PRC government. Some scholars made hypothesis that they are descendants of [[Mongol]]s.

[[Taiwan]] is completely under the administration of the [[Republic of China]], is excluded from this list. Please refer to [[Demographics of Taiwan]] for more information. The two [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]]s (S.A.R.) of the P.R.C., namely [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], are not part of [[mainland China]] are also excluded. Please refer to [[Demographics of Hong Kong]] and [[Demographics of Macau]].

Autonomous regions are marked with an asterisk (*).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3532">'''Moctezuma's table''' refers to both the place and the manner in which the Aztec emperor ([[Tlatoani]]) ate his food. Important chronologists were witnesses to this daily ritual. One of these, [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], extrapolated in his book, ''[[The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]] (Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España),'' how the [[Mexica]]s specific protocols and etiquette were passed down from one generation to the next. The abundance of typical meals that were found in this daily banquet are largely reflected in today's Mexican cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico|last=Díaz del Castillo|first=Bernal|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Cudahy|year=1956|isbn=|location=United States|pages=208–211|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moctezuma's table represents more than just Aztec cuisine and the perfection of great eating (buen comer) because it also demonstrates the prerogative that was required to create them. Trade routes and agreements with civilizations bordering Aztec territory were essential in order to have the most delicious and fresh ingredients.

== Typical Dishes on Moctezuma's Table ==
Another chronologist, [[Francisco de Aguilar (conquistador)|Fray Francisco de Aguilar]], mentions some of the typical meals that were served in this spectacular ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moctezuma's Table: Rolando Briseño's Mexican and Chicano tablescapes|last=Cantú|first=Norma E.|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2010|isbn=1-60344-183-2|location=USA|pages=Artist's Statement: xxii-xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A legend exists that [[Moctezuma II]] also enjoyed various types of meat, human flesh among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/worldhistorysources/sources/conquestofnewspain.html|title="The True History of the Conquest of New Spain"|website=chnm.gmu.edu|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that he ate the flesh of slaves, youth, women, and children etc. depending on which god the sacrifice was directed towards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lienzoculinario.com/2010/10/asi-sabe-mexico-los-banquetes-de.html#.WKuvTDs6qUm|title=Así Sabe México: Los Banquetes de Moctezuma|website=www.lienzoculinario.com|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical food that continues to be part of Mexican culture could be identified from his meals as well, such as: cacao (cocoa), maize, tomato and a large variety of spices (such as vanilla) etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.uwm.edu/carlin/an-invitation-to-dine-aztec-food-and-drink/|title=AN INVITATION TO DINE: AZTEC FOOD AND DRINK – Martha Carlin|website=people.uwm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other typical meals were found:

'''Ustad Mohammad Ibraheem Khwakhuzhi''' ({{lang-ps|استاد محمد ابراهيم خواخوږى}}) son of Dur Mohammad Khan Baloch (descendant of Khan of Kalat Mir [[Muhammad Nasir Khan I]]) was born on 28 February 1920 in [[Kandahar|Malajat district of Kandahar province]], [[Afghanistan]].&lt;br/&gt;
His son [[Gharzai Khwakhuzhi]] is an active politician in Afghan government and his grandson [[Gharanai Khwakhuzhi]] is an Afghan Foreign Service Officer at Ministry of Foreign Affairs of [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]].

== Early life ==
Mohammad Ibraheem Khwakhuzhi started his primary schooling at age 6 and after his baccalaureate in 1936 he attended Teachers Training College finishing it successfully in 1938.&lt;br /&gt;

His first poem was published in 1934 (at the age of 14) in Tolo-e-Afghan newspaper.

== Political Life ==
Mohammad Ibraheem Khwakhuzhi started his political career with the establishment of [[Weesh Zalmyan]] (Awakened Youth) movement in 1947 where he was amongst the founding members of the movement from [[Kandahar]] province.
Mr. Zarmalwal mentions him in one of his articles which states;
:'' "The following people were amongst the founding members of the movement:
:'''''From Kandahar and Farah:''' Pohand [[Abdul Hai Habibi]], Ustad [[Abdul Rauf Benawa]], Late. Faiz Mohammad Angar, Late. Mohammad Rasul Khan Pashtoon, Pohand [[Abdul Shakoor Rashad]], Ustad Mohammad Ibraheem Khwakhuzhi and Late. Abdul Razaq Farahi.
:'''''From Nangarhar:''' Ustad [[Gul Pacha Ulfat]], Ustad Qyam-ud-Dean Khadim, Pohand Siddique ullah Reshtein and Late. Ghulam Hassan Khan Safi.
:'''''From Ghazni:''' Late. [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]].
:'''''From Pakiya:''' Neek Mohammad Pakityanai and Ghulam Mai-ud-Dean Zarmalwal who was known as Ghulam Mai-ud-Dean Roshan." ''

In 1950 [[Weesh Zalmyan]] movement came under a crackdown of the government for its liberal and modernized demands and Mohammad Ibraheem Khwakhuzhi who was then director of Education in Kandahar Province, became the first member of the movement to be arrested.
Ghulam Gelani Khan writes about this in a topic in Mohammad Alam Buserkai’s book called “Weesh Zalmyan” where he states;
:''"In 1950 the Afghanistan’s Weesh Zalmyan Movement was at its best in the Kandahar Province and was progressing well.
:''As one of our active member late. Mohammad Ibraheem Khwakhuzhi the director of Education in Kandahar Province was arrested by the Kandahar’s governor Mohammad Younus Khan; he was the first member of our Movement to be arrested by the Government."''
Later in mid 60s he joined the [[Progressive Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] under the leadership of Late. [[Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal]].

'''Movember''' (a [[portmanteau]] of the [[Diminutives in Australian English|Australian-English diminutive word]] for [[moustache]], "mo",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garone|first1=Adam|title=Healthier men, one moustache at a time|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_garone_healthier_men_one_moustache_at_a_time/transcript?language=en#t-117452|website=TED.com|publisher=TED Conferences, LLC|accessdate=2 November 2014|language=|format=Video with transcript|date=November 2011|quote=So in Australia, 'mo' is slang for mustache, so we renamed the month of November 'Movember'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[November]]") is an annual event involving the growing of moustaches during the month of [[November]] to raise awareness of men's health issues, such as [[prostate cancer]], [[testicular cancer]], and men's [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movember United States|url=https://us.movember.com/programs/cause|website=Movember United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Movember Foundation]] runs the Movember charity event, housed at Movember.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.movember.com/about/corporate-governance/ |title=Movember United States - About Movember |publisher=Us.movember.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Movember is to "change the face of men's health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart |first=Chato B. |url=http://blogs.psychcentral.com/humor/2010/11/change-the-face-of-mens-health-by-growing-a-moustache-prostate-cancer-and-depression/ |title=Change the FACE of Men’s Health by Growing a mustache for Dick Cancer &amp;#124; Mental Health Humor |publisher=Blogs.psychcentral.com |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By encouraging men (whom the charity refers to as "Mo Bros") to get involved, Movember aims to increase early cancer detection, diagnosis and effective treatments, and ultimately reduce the number of preventable deaths. Besides annual check-ups, the Movember Foundation encourages men to be aware of family history of cancer and to adopt a healthier lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxdc.com/dpp/news/national/foxnews/Mustaches-Raise-Millions-for-Mens-Health_25415908 |title=Mustaches Raise Millions for Men's Health |publisher=Myfoxdc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004, the Movember Foundation [[Charitable organization|charity]] has run Movember events to raise awareness and funds for men's health issues, such as [[prostate cancer]] and [[clinical depression|depression]], in Australia and New Zealand. In 2007, events were launched in Ireland, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Spain, the United Kingdom, Israel, South Africa, Taiwan and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.movember.com/momoney/ |title=Movember United States - Mo Money |publisher=Us.movember.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Doll |first=Jen |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/11/movember_shave.php |title=Movember: Shave Off Your Moustache (and Grow It Back) for Men's Health, Amusement - New York News - Runnin' Scared |publisher=Blogs.villagevoice.com |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2011-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204095318/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/11/movember_shave.php |archivedate=2011-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/01/living/movember-mustaches/index.html |title='Movember' gets hairy, for a cause |publisher=CNN.com |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="am1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.am980.ca/channels/news/local/story.aspx?ID=1564511 |title=AM980 News Talk Sports From Scary To Hairy, Halloween Is Over But Movember Is Just Starting Local News |publisher=Am980.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, Canadians were the largest contributors to the Movember charities of any nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.movember.com/momoney/ |title=Canadian website |publisher=Ca.movember.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Movember merged with the testicular cancer event [[Tacheback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tacheback.co.uk/html/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Tacheback |date= |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
''[[Seven Network|Seven Nightly News]]'' aired a story in 1999 including a group of young men in [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] who coined the term "Movember" and the idea of growing moustaches for charity throughout the month of November.&lt;ref name=news&gt;Ashcroft, J. (30 November 1999) &lt;!--If you know the name of the story please insert it inverted commas here--&gt;''Seven Nightly News Movember Mo-Phenomenon |https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPH0qQFqs0M|'', [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] Adelaide&lt;/ref&gt; In the news report, members of the Adelaide-based "Movember Committee" explained how they came up with the idea for Movember one night in the [[pub]]. The group started with 80 men from Adelaide and soon became a nationwide phenomenon. They also aimed to raise money for the [[RSPCA]] through selling [[T-shirts]] in what they termed "Growing whiskers for whiskers".&lt;ref name=news/&gt;

In 2004, an unrelated group in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] organised an event where 30 men would grow a moustache for 30 days in order to raise awareness for prostate cancer and depression in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/04/movemeber-facial-hair-prostate-cancer-awareness_n_1074615.html |title='Movember' Urges Men To Grow Facial Hair, Fundraise For Prostate Cancer Awareness (SLIDESHOW) |publisher=huffingtonpost.com |date= 2011-11-04|accessdate=2011-11-22 |first=Eleanor |last=Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.movember.com/about/ |title= Movember Australia |publisher=movember.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group would later become the Movember Foundation charity.

The Movember Foundation has since raised $174-million worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flandez |first=Raymund |url=http://philanthropy.com/article/Charity-Tries-New-Messages-and/129716/ |title=Charity Tries New Messages and Logos Every Year - Marketing and Communications - The Chronicle of Philanthropy- Connecting the nonprofit world with news, jobs, and ideas |publisher=Philanthropy.com |date=2011-11-13 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; after spreading to South Africa and Europe, reaching North America in 2006.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="am1"/&gt; In 2010, participants in the United States alone raised over $7.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallwerks.com/a-social-media-look-into-the-madness-of-movember |title=A Social Media Look Into the Madness of ‘Movember’ |publisher=SmallWerks |date=2011-11-04 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, 1.1 million people signed up to participate, raising upwards of $95 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kwoh |first=Leslie |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2012/11/30/movember-moustache-growing-draws-ceo/ |title=Movember- Moustache-Growing Event Draws CEOs and Company Leaders - At Work - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Moscars===
[[File:Novembro Azul.jpg|thumb|Public hospital in Brazil with an inflatable moustache in November 2013]]

The charity launched The Moscars in 2010, an online global user-submitted video contest that helps Movember participants showcase their involvement in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prlog.org/10978215-movember-launches-the-moscars-video-contest-using-invokes-memelabs-platform.html |title=Movember Launches 'The Moscars' Video Contest  |publisher=PRLog|date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Submissions cannot be longer than 4 minutes each, and prizes can be won in several categories.

In 2012, head judge [[Stan Lee]] awarded the Moscar to South Africa's comedy duo [[Derick Watts &amp;amp; The Sunday Blues]] for their video, "The Movember Song", a parody of [[Carly Rae Jepsen]]'s hit "Call Me Maybe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://za.movember.com/mo-community/moscars/ |title=The Moscars 2012 |publisher=Movember |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Man of Movember===

The International Man of Movember is chosen from 21 national winners all over the world to wear the crown and be the face of Movember for a whole year. Each national Man of Movember winner is voted in at that particular country's main Gala Parté, held at the end of November, by both judges and fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beardicure.com/what-is-movember|title=What is Movember? Here's Absolutely Everything You Need to Know|author=|date=31 October 2016|website=beardicure.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first champion was Mark Knight from London in 2010. South Africa's Anton Taylor won the title in 2011, and in 2012 it was Chris Thwaites from New Zealand who won the coveted sash. 2013 saw Sweden's Tom Rickard crowned.

===Controversies===

In November 2007, at [[Scots College, Wellington|Scots College]] in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, several graduating students were banned from end-of-year prizes for growing moustaches and the college threatened to ban a senior student from their [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement|NCEA]] examinations (official secondary school qualification) for growing a moustache during November.&lt;ref name=Dominion&gt;{{cite news

In 2007, the Movember Foundation events were featured on Australian tabloid current affairs program ''[[Today Tonight]]'', which accused the foundation of spending a disproportionate amount on running costs and high salaries for its directors.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour, B.

"'''Nouveau pauvre'''" ("new poor"), refers to a person who had once owned considerable wealth, but has now lost all or most of it. This term is generally used to emphasize that the individual was previously part of a higher socioeconomic rank, and that such wealth that provided the means for the acquisition of goods or luxuries is currently unobtainable. These people may or may not actually be poor, but compared to their previous rank, it seems as if they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recessionwire.com/2009/06/15/definition-of-nouveau-poor/ |title=Recession Lexicon: Nouveau Poor |last=Rich |first=Laura |date=June 15, 2009 |publisher=Recessionwire |accessdate=2009-08-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829144529/http://www.recessionwire.com/2009/06/15/definition-of-nouveau-poor/ |archivedate=August 29, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Balailzai ([[Panni]])" refers to a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Another name for the tribe of Panni is Balailzai. Like other Pashtuns, they have Eastern Iranian genetic and ethnolinguistic heritage. They descended from Gharghasht, one of Qais Abdur Rashīd's sons. Most are settled in parts of Pakistan or Afghanistan, such as [[Karachi]], [[Quetta]], Musakhail, [[Dera Ismail Khan]], [[Mardan]], [[Peshawar]], [[Panian]], [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]], [[Kabul]], [[Tank, Pakistan|Tank]], [[Kohat]], while there are some communities in the United States, United Kingdom, and other Western countries. They were, at one point in time, were holding main posts in the Government especially during the rule of Bahlol Lodhi. After his reign ended, they scattered and migrated to various parts of the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}  Panni's are migrated to [[South India]] . Panni are [[Nawab of Kurnool]] and [[Nawab of the Carnatic]] which rule in [[Mughal Empire]]. Most of the Panni's are settled in [[Pakistan]].

==History==

Panni Naghar, Devi and Babai were real brothers. All tribes are present in Baluchistan([[Pakistan]]) and Afghanistan. The Balailzai tribe were camel and horse breeders entered in India with Bahlol Lodi's army and remained in glory as long as Lodi ruled . That's why the population of Lodi, Naghar and Balailzai is less as compared to other Pashtun tribes in [[Baluchistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. When [[Lodi dynasty|Lodi]] was defeated by [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], the Balailzai started selling horses/camels. Later on they settled in different places of [[India]], like [[Karachi]], [[Quetta]], [[Musakhel, Punjab|Musakhail]], [[Dera Ismail Khan]], [[Mardan]], [[Peshawar]], [[Panian]], [[Kabul]], [[Tank]]{{dn|date=October 2017}}, [[Kohat]], Khanozai, Ziarat Rode Malazai, Gulistan, Ajram, Kandahar, Harnai, Kohlu, Sibi, Sindh and Panjab Gurani in District Rothak, Rajestan and Hyderabad. Their mother tongue is [[Pashtu language|Pashtu]]. Balailzai are living in village name Kohi near Musakhail bazaar, in Wazirstan, Pakistan while Afghanistan majority of migratory Afghan tribes are known as Kochi. The chief of Panni Pashtuns are [[Barozai]] living in [[Sibi]] and [[Musakhel District, Pakistan|Musakhail]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Location==

Those who belong to or hail from the Panni tribe are settled in [[Panian]], [[Karachi]], [[Quetta]], Musakhail,Mandokhail [[Dera Ismail Khan]], [[Mardan]], [[Peshawar]], [[Kabul]], [[Tank]], [[Kohat]]. Panni's are also known as Pannai, Pani, Balailzai and Panezai. The Panezai is the biggest clan among Snatia, who live in Khanozai, Ziarat Rode Malazai, [[Gulistan, Balochistan|Gulistan]], Ajram, [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]], Harnai and [[Quetta]]. The [[Tareen]] historically are the second largest tribe in Baluchistan. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Sub-tribes==

[[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribes, are divided into four supertribal confederacies: the Arbanee (Sarabani), Betanee (Baitani), [[Gharghasht|Ghrghashta]], and Karlanee (Krai, Kerlani). Balailzai come under the [[Gharghasht]] tribe.Now a day Barozai Tribe is calling himself as chief of panni , they actually based from sangan village and displaced and migrated to Sibi. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''Participatory economics''', often abbreviated '''parecon''', is an [[economic system]] based on [[participation (decision making)|participatory decision making]] as the primary [[economics|economic mechanism]] for allocation in society. In the system the say in decision-making is proportional to the impact on a person or group of people. Participatory economics is a form of [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized economic planning]] and [[socialism]] involving the [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. It is a proposed alternative to contemporary [[capitalism]] and [[centralized planning]]. This economic model is primarily associated with political theorist [[Michael Albert]] and economist [[Robin Hahnel]], who describe participatory economics as an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] economic vision.&lt;ref&gt;Albert, Michael [http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/Chapte19.htm Parecon: Life After Capitalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016053719/http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/Chapte19.htm |date=2008-10-16 }} Chapter 19 Individuals / Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are [[Equity (economics)|equity]], [[social solidarity|solidarity]], diversity, [[workers' self-management]] and efficiency (defined as accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets). The institutions of parecon include [[workers' council|workers']] and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for making decisions, [[balanced job complex]]es, [[remuneration]] based on individual effort, and participatory planning.

== Decision-making principle ==
A primary proposition of parecon is that everyone should have a say in decisions proportionate to the degree to which they are affected by them. This principle is often referred to as ''self-management''. In parecon, it constitutes a replacement for the mainstream economic conception of [[economic freedom]], which Albert and Hahnel argue by its very vagueness has allowed it to be abused by [[capitalist]] ideologues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Production and work==
{{labor}}

=== Balanced job complexes ===
{{Main|balanced job complex}}
A main goal of socialism is to create a society without classes or hierarchy, and traditional socialist thinking identifies classes based on ownership of the means of production (in capitalism, those are the capitalist class and the proletarian class).  However, Albert and Hahnel identify a third class created by the particular division of labor. Some tasks and jobs are more desirable than others; also some are more empowering. Hahnel and Albert argue that empowering jobs, such as accounting or management, provide access to information and skills to formulate ideas and plans for decision making, while other jobs, such as cleaning, do not provide these. Thus workers with disempowering jobs can at best ratify proposals by empowered workers, and have little reason to participate in collective decision making. Workers with empowering jobs are a third class, "coordinator class" that does not own the means of production but has more power than menial workers. This class exists in current and past capitalist, socialist and cooperative economies. Coordinator jobs include political office, management, law, medicine, accounting, research.

To distribute work equitably and empower all workers in decisions in their workplace, in participatory economics each worker does tasks, which, taken together, result in an average desirability and average empowerment among all workers.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel, "Looking Forward" pp. 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compensation for effort and sacrifice ===
Albert and Hahnel argue that it is inequitable and ineffective to compensate people on the basis of luck (e.g. skills or talents that owe to their birth or heredity), or by virtue of workers' productivity (as measured by the ''value'' of the goods they produce). Therefore, the primary principle of participatory economics is to reward workers for their effort and sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Albert, Michael Parecon p. 112-117"&gt;Albert, Michael Parecon: Life After Capitalism Part II, Chapter 7: Remuneration pp. 112–17.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[mining]] work—which is [[safety|dangerous]] and uncomfortable—would be more highly paid than [[office]] work for the same amount of time, thus allowing the miner to work fewer hours for the same pay, and the burden of highly dangerous and strenuous jobs to be shared among the populace.

Additionally, participatory economics would provide exemptions from the compensation for effort principle.&lt;ref name="Albert, Michael Parecon p. 112-117"/&gt; People with [[disability|disabilities]] who are unable to work, [[child]]ren, the [[elderly]], the infirm and workers who are legitimately in transitional circumstances, can be remunerated according to need. However, every ''able'' adult has the obligation to perform some socially useful work as a requirement for receiving reward. However, everyone would be entitled to free [[health care]], [[education]], skills training, and the freedom to choose between various democratically structured workplaces with balanced jobs balanced for desirability and empowerment.

The starting point for the income of all workers in a participatory economy is an equal share of the social product. From this point, incomes for personal [[expenditure]]s and consumption rights for public goods can be expected to diverge by small degrees, reflecting the choices that individuals make in between work and [[leisure]] time, and the level of danger and difficulty of a job as judged by their immediate workplace peers.&lt;ref name="Albert, Michael Parecon p. 112-117"/&gt;

===Workplace democracy ===
The archetypal [[workplace democracy]] model, the [[Wobbly Shop]] was pioneered by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], in which the self-managing norms of [[grassroots democracy]] were applied.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Scale===
While many types of production and consumption may become more localised under participatory economics, the model does not exclude [[economies of scale]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Innovation===
Hahnel has also written a detailed discussion of parecon's desirability compared to capitalism with respect to incentives to innovate.&lt;ref&gt;''Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation'' p. 241, Hahnel, Routledge, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In capitalism, [[patent law]]s, [[intellectual property rights]] and [[barriers to market entry]] are institutional features that reward individual innovators while limiting the use of new technologies. Hahnel notes that, in contrast, "in a participatory economy all innovations will immediately be made available to all enterprises, so there will never be any loss of static efficiency.".&lt;ref&gt;''Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation'' p. 240, Hahnel, Routledge, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Innovation is sometimes the outcome of cumulative creativity, which pareconomists believe may not be legitimately attributed to individuals.

==Allocation==
Participatory planning is the allocation mechanism in a participatory economy, and is meant to provide a workable alternative to market competition and centralized planning. The planning procedure is conceived as an iterative process in which, (1) production proposals made by workers councils and (2) consumption proposals made by individuals and their neighborhood councils, are submitted and revised through multiple rounds of pricing updates until the process converges on a feasible plan for the upcoming year.

The process begins when the facilitation board (see below) announces a list of indicative prices for each final consumer good, as well as for each capital good, natural resource, and category of labor that is available to society. These indicative prices are calculated to reflect the estimated opportunity costs for producing various goods and services, and incorporate both social costs and pollution impacts. In response to this list of prices, individuals draft an annual consumption plan for goods/services they wish to consume in the coming year, and also meet in their neighborhood councils to deliberate and democratically arrive at a plan for the consumption of public goods (e.g. obtaining resources to build a public playground). As workers, individuals also meet in their workplaces to determine what outputs they will produce and what inputs they will consume in the production process, as well as how much they would each like to work. Thus, workers and consumers (as well as any federations of workers or consumers) submit their initial requests to the facilitation board, which aggregates this information.

Because the conclusion of the first round of this process will almost certainly not be a workable plan, the facilitation board proceeds to update the list of indicative prices for each good up or down, in proportion to the excess demand and supply for each, so that the updated prices reflect a more accurate estimate of the social opportunity costs of each item. The announcement of updated indicative prices then initiates the second round of the planning process, in which consumers and workers revise and resubmit their proposals in light of the new information. In particular, consumption proposals in which the individual's proposed effort rating does not warrant the proposed level of consumption will need to be adjusted, so that the individual will either have to reduce his/her consumption requests, shift them to less costly products, or increase his/her projected work-hours for the coming year. Other consumers may discover that their initial proposals were too modest, and can revise their consumption upwards, if they choose, or they can revise their projected effort rating downwards by proposing to work fewer hours and increasing leisure time.

Production proposals are also summarized and evaluated on a quantitative basis, in this case by the ratio of social benefits to social costs. (The social benefit part of the ratio is calculated by multiplying the proposed quantity of outputs from a workplace by their indicative prices, adding negative prices for any proposed pollution emissions and summing. The social costs are calculated by multiplying the quantity of requested inputs by their indicative prices and summing.) Proposals with a benefits-to-cost ratio below one will need to make adjustments in order to gain approval in the next round, either by switching to a less polluting technology, producing a more socially desirable set of outputs, or using less costly inputs.

After receiving the revised proposals, the facilitation board once again updates the list of indicative prices. After several rounds of this revision and re-submission process, the result is convergence to a feasible plan in which workers and consumers are able to accomplish the activities that they detailed in their final submissions. Even after a feasible plan is achieved, flexible mid-year revisions of consumer/worker proposals can also be incorporated into the planning process.

In academic work, Albert and Hahnel (1991) prove that participatory planning arrives at a [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto optimum]], and does so under less restrictive assumptions than markets; that is, participatory planning is Pareto optimal even though it incorporates both public goods and externalities, whereas markets do not achieve Pareto optimality with these two assumptions).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

A feature of participatory planning which differs from other modes of democratic planning is that all deliberation on proposals occurs within councils, but does not take place between councils. That is, under parecon, a feasible economic plan is constructed due to an iterative adjustment of prices (participatory planning) based on councils' self-activity proposals, rather than owing to a procedure of deliberation among delegates across workplaces/industries. This is potentially desirable by cutting down on the meeting time and bureaucratic burdens needed to converge on an annual plan.

=== Facilitation boards ===
In a proposed participatory economy, key information relevant to converging on an economic plan would be made available by [[Facilitation board (economics)|Iteration Facilitation Boards]] (IFBs), which, based on proposals from worker/consumer councils and economic data, present indicative prices and economic projections at each round of the planning process.

The IFB has no decision-making authority. In theory, the IFB's activity can consist mainly of computers performing the (agreed upon) algorithms for adjusting prices and forecasts, with little human involvement.{{r|ifb}}

== Opposition to central planning and capitalism ==
{{See also|Libertarian socialism}}
[[Robin Hahnel]] has argued that "participatory planning is not central planning", stating  "The procedures are completely different and the incentives are completely different.  And one of the important ways in which it is different from central planning is that it is incentive compatible, that is, actors have an incentive to report truthfully rather than an incentive to misrepresent their capabilities or preferences."&lt;ref&gt;''Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation'', p. 221, Hahnel, Routledge, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike historical examples of central planning, the parecon proposal advocates the use and adjustment of price information reflecting marginal social opportunity costs and benefits as integral elements of the planning process. Hahnel has argued emphatically against Milton Friedman's [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]] tendency to deny the possibility of alternatives:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Friedman assumes away the best solution for coordinating economic activities. He simply asserts "there are only two ways of coordinating the economic activities of millions—central direction involving the use of [[coercion]]—and voluntary cooperation, the technique of the marketplace." [...] a participatory economy can permit all to partake in economic decision making in proportion to the degree they are affected by outcomes. Since a participatory system uses a system of participatory planning instead of markets to coordinate economic activities, Friedman would have us believe that participatory planning must fall into the category of "central direction involving the use of coercion."&lt;ref&gt;''Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation'' p. 81, Hahnel, Routledge, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Albert and Hahnel have voiced detailed critiques of centrally-planned economies in theory and practice, but are also highly-critical of capitalism. Hahnel claims "the truth is capitalism aggravates prejudice, is the most inequitable economy ever devised, is grossly inefficient—even if highly energetic—and is incompatible with both economic and political democracy. In the present era of free-market triumphalism it is useful to organize a sober evaluation of capitalism responding to Friedman's claims one by one."&lt;ref&gt;''Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation'' ch. 4, Hahnel, Routledge, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critique of markets ===
Mainstream economists largely acknowledge the problem of externalities but believe they can be addressed either through [[Coase theorem|Coasian bargaining]] or the use of [[Pigovian tax]]es—extra taxes on goods that have externalities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} According to economic theory, if Pigovian taxes are set so that the after-tax cost of the goods is equal to the social cost of the goods, the direct cost of production plus cost of externalities, then quantities produced will tend toward a socially optimal level. Hahnel observes, "more and more economists outside the mainstream are challenging this assumption, and a growing number of skeptics now dare to suggest that externalities are prevalent, and often substantial". Or, as E.K. Hunt put it: externalities are the rule rather than the exception, and therefore markets often work as if they were guided by a "malevolent invisible foot" that keeps kicking us to produce more of some things, and less of others than is socially efficient."&lt;ref&gt;''Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation, 85''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=May 2014}}

As long as a market economy is in place, Albert and Hahnel favour Pigovian taxes over other solutions to environmental problems such as [[command economy|command and control]], or the issuance of marketable permits. However, Hahnel, who teaches ecological economics at American University, argues that in a market economy businesses try to avoid the "polluter pays principle" by shifting the burden of the costs for their polluting activities to consumers. In terms of incentives he argues this might be considered a positive development because it would penalize consumers for "dirty" consumption. However it also has regressive implications since [[tax incidence]] studies show that ultimately it would be poor people who would bear a great deal of the burden of many pollution taxes. "In other words, many pollution taxes would be highly regressive and therefore aggravate economic injustice."&lt;ref&gt;''Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation, 274''.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore recommends that pollution taxes be linked to cuts in regressive taxes such as social security taxes.

Hahnel argues that Pigovian taxes, along with associated corrective measures advanced by market economists, ultimately fall far short of adequately or fairly addressing externalities. He argues such methods are incapable of attaining accurate assessments of social costs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Markets corrected by pollution taxes only lead to the efficient amount of pollution and satisfy the polluter pays principle if the taxes are set equal to the magnitude of the damage victims suffer. But because markets are not incentive compatible for polluters and pollution victims, markets provide no reliable way to estimate the magnitudes of efficient taxes for pollutants. Ambiguity over who has the property right, polluters or pollution victims, free rider problems among multiple victims, and the transaction costs of forming and maintaining an effective coalition of pollution victims, each of whom is affected to a small but unequal degree, all combine to render market systems incapable of eliciting accurate information from pollution victims about the damages they suffer, or acting upon that information even if it were known.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Hahnel, (2004). [http://www.greens.org/s-r/34/34-18.html "Protecting the Environment in a Participatory Economy"]. Retrieved February 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Class and hierarchy ===
Advocates of parecon say the intention is that the four main ingredients of parecon be implemented with a minimum of [[hierarchy]] and a maximum of transparency in all discussions and decision-making. This model is designed to eliminate secrecy in economic decision-making, and instead encourage friendly cooperation and mutual support. This avoidance of power hierarchies puts parecon in the [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]] political tradition.  [[Stephen Shalom]] has produced a political system meant to complement parecon, called [[parpolity]].

Although parecon falls under [[left-wing]] political tradition, it is designed to avoid the creation of powerful intellectual elites or the rule of a bureaucracy, which is perceived as the major problem of the economies of the [[communist state]]s of the 20th century.{{r|marx}} In their book ''Looking Forward'' Albert and Hanhel termed this situation 'coordinatorism'.{{r|looking|p=4-8}} Parecon advocates recognize that monopolization of empowering labor, in addition to private ownership, can be a source of class division. Thus, a three-class view of the economy (capitalists, coordinators, and workers) is stressed, in contrast to the traditional two-class view of Marxism. The coordinator class, emphasized in parecon, refers to those who have a monopoly on empowering skills and knowledge, and corresponds to the doctors, lawyers, managers, engineers, and other professionals in present economies. Parecon advocates argue that, historically, Marxism ignored the ability of coordinators to become a new ruling class in a post-capitalist society.&lt;ref name=marx&gt;http://www.zcommunications.org/parecon-and-marxism-by-michael-albert&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Participatory economics is not in itself intended to provide a general political system, clearly its practical implementation would depend on an accompanying political system.

Albert and Hahnel stress that parecon is only meant to address an alternative economic theory and must be accompanied by equally important alternative visions in the fields of [[politics]], [[culture]] and [[kinship]]. The authors have also discussed elements of [[anarchism]] in the field of politics, [[polyculturalism]] in the field of culture, and [[feminism]] in the field of family and gender relations as being possible foundations for future alternative visions in these other spheres of society. [[Stephen R. Shalom]] has begun work on a participatory political vision he calls "[[participatory politics|par polity]]". Both systems together make up the political philosophy of [[Participism]].

== Criticisms ==
[[David Schweickart]] suggests participatory economics would be undesirable even if it was possible, accusing it of being: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;a system obsessed with comparison (Is your job complex more empowering than mine?), with monitoring (You are not working at average intensity, mate—get with the program), with the details of consumption (How many rolls of toilet paper will I need next year?  Why are some of my neighbors still using the kind not made of recycled paper?)&lt;ref name="Schweickart"&gt;{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |url=http://homepages.luc.edu/~dschwei/parecon.htm#_edn1 |date=January 2006 |title=Michael Albert's Parecon: A Critique |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Planning ===
{{further|Economic calculation problem}}

Participatory economics would create a large amount of administrative work for individual workers, who would have to plan their consumption in advance, and a new bureaucratic class. Proponents of parecon argue that capitalist economies are hardly free of bureaucracy or meetings, and a parecon would eliminate banks, advertising, stock market, tax returns and long-term financial planning. Albert and Hahnel claim that it is probable that a similar number of workers will be involved in a parecon bureaucracy as in a capitalist bureaucracy,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel, "Looking Forward" pp. 86–89.&lt;/ref&gt; with much of the voting achieved by computer rather than meeting, and those who are not interested in the collective consumption proposals not required to attend.&lt;ref name="zcommunications.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zcommunications.org/znet/viewArticle/19697 |title=Participatory Economics by Michael Albert &amp;#124; ZNet Article |publisher=ZCommunications |date=2008-11-19 |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics suggest that  proposals require consideration of an unfeasibly large set of policy choices,&lt;ref name="Schweickart" /&gt; and that lessons from planned societies show that peoples' daily needs cannot be established well in advance simply by asking people what they want.&lt;ref name="Fotopoulos" /&gt; Albert and Hahnel note that markets themselves hardly adjust prices instantaneously,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Albert, "Parecon: Life After Capitalism", p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; and suggest that in a participatory economy [[Facilitation board (economics)|facilitation boards]] could modify prices on a regular basis. According to Hahnel these act according to democratically decided guidelines, can be composed of members from other regions and are impossible to bribe due to parecon's non-transferable currency.&lt;ref name="Robin Hahnel p. 92-93"&gt;Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel, "Looking Forward" pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Takis Fotopoulos]] argues that "no kind of economic organisation based on planning alone, however democratic and decentralised it is, can secure real self-management and freedom of choice."&lt;ref name="Fotopoulos"&gt;Takis Fotopoulos (2003), "Inclusive Democracy and Participatory Economics", ''Democracy &amp; Nature'', Volume 9, Issue 3 November 2003, pp. 401–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of efficiency===
Parecon might reduce efficiency in the workplace.  For one, expert and exceptional workers (e.g. exceptional surgeons and scientists) would not be performing their tasks full-time. Participatory economics would expect them to share in "disempowering work" and would not offer opportunities to seek additional compensation for their high ability or finding solutions to problems. In a lecture at Willamette University in Oregon in 2015, Hahnel responded to this criticism by explaining that these jobs could be filled by machines, which are underutilized in capitalist economic systems due to the lowered rates of profit, and also division of labor wouldn't exist under a participatory economic system as much as it does under capitalism, so people wouldn't always have the same jobs.

Theodore Burczak argues that it is impossible for workers to give the unbiased assessments of the "largely unobservable" characteristics of effort proposed as the basis for salary levels, and the absence of market exchange mechanisms likewise makes calculating social costs of production and consumption impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burczak|first=Theodore A.|title=Socialism after Hayek |pages=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
In 2012, the International Organization for a Participatory Society was founded advocating for a participatory society including participatory economics, also referred to as [[participism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://roarmag.org/essays/parecon-participatory-economics-interview-michael-albert/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iopsociety.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23010">The term '''Peak coal''' is used to refer to the point in time at which [[coal]] production and consumption reaches its maximum, after which, it is assumed, production and consumption will decline steadily. The term was originally used in connection with [[M. King Hubbert]]'s [[Hubbert peak theory]], in which the finite nature of the resource determines a constraint on production. However, since the expansion of [[renewable energy]] particularly in electricity generation, the term is now commonly used with reference to a peak in coal demand, which may already have occurred.

== Hubbert's theory ==

According to [[M. King Hubbert]]'s [[Hubbert peak theory]], '''peak coal''' is the point in time at which the maximum global coal production rate is reached, after which, according to the theory, the rate of production will enter a terminal decline.  [[Coal]] is a [[fossil fuel]] formed from plant matter over the course of millions of years.  It is a finite resource and thus considered to be a [[non-renewable energy]] source.

There are two different possible peaks: one measured by mass (i.e. metric tons) and another by energy output (i.e. petajoules). The world average heat content per mass of mined coal rose from 8,020 BTU/lb. in 1989 to 9,060 BTU/lb. in 1999. Since 1999, the world average heat content of mined coal has been fairly steady, and was 9,030 BTU/lb. in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=1&amp;pid=7&amp;aid=1&amp;cid=ww,&amp;syid=1980&amp;eyid=2012&amp;unit=TST International Energy Statistics], accessed 16 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimates for global peak coal extraction vary wildly. Many coal associations suggest the peak could occur in 200 years or more, while scholarly estimates predict the peak to occur as soon as the immediate future. Research in 2009 by the University of Newcastle in Australia concluded that global coal extraction could peak sometime between the present and 2048.&lt;ref name="newcastle.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newcastle.edu.au/news/2009/10/28/research-forecasts-world-coal-production-could-peak-as-soon-as-2010.html | publisher=The University of Newcastle, Australia | title=Research forecasts world coal production could peak as soon as 2010 | date=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p 8 --&gt; A 2007 study by the German Energy Watch Group predicted that global peak coal extraction may occur sometime around 2025 at 30 percent above the 2005 rate.&lt;ref name="ewg2007coal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energywatchgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EWG_Report_Coal_10-07-2007ms1.pdf |format=PDF|title=Coal: Resources And Future Production |publisher=Energy Watch Group |author= |date=10 July 2007 |accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://energywatchgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EWG_Report_Uranium_3-12-2006ms1.pdf |format=PDF| title=Uranium Resources and Nuclear Energy | publisher=Energy Watch Group | date=December 2006 | accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary concept of peak coal follows from Hubbert peak theory,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} which is most commonly associated with [[peak oil]].  Hubbert concluded that each oil region and nation has a bell-shaped [[Oil depletion|depletion curve]].&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |format=PDF |title=Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels 'Drilling and Production Practice' |author=M. King Hubbert |publisher=[[American Petroleum Institute|API]] |page=36 |date=June 1956 |accessdate=18 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233843/http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this question was originally raised by [[William Stanley Jevons]] in his book [[The Coal Question]] in 1865.

Hubbert noted that [[United States]] coal extraction grew exponentially at a steady 6.6% per year from 1850 to 1910.  Then the growth leveled off.  He concluded that no finite resource could sustain exponential growth.  At some point, the rate of extraction will have to peak and then decline until the resource is exhausted.  He theorized that extraction rate plotted versus time would show a bell-shaped curve, declining as rapidly as it had risen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |format=PDF |title=Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels 'Drilling and Production Practice' |author=M.

The [[Hubbert linearization]] using yearly production rates has weaknesses for peak coal calculation, as the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] is inferior with coal mining data compared to oil extraction. As a consequence, Rutledge&lt;ref name=Rutledge_2011&gt;

By this method the [[estimated ultimate recovery]] results in a stable fit for active coal regions. The ultimate production for world coal is estimated to be 680 Gt, of which 309 Gt have already been produced.
However, in 2013 the World Coal Association reported that two different estimates of coal reserves remaining were 1038 and 861 Gt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcoal.org/resources/coal-statistics/|title=Resources|work=World Coal Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peak coal demand ==
[[File:World Coal Consumption.png|thumb|World annual coal consumption 1970-2015]]
[[File:Top Coal-Consuming Nations.png|thumb|left|Consumption trends in the top five coal-consuming countries 1985-2015]]
Although reserves of coal remain abundant, consumption of coal has declined in many countries. In 2016 Scotland closed its last coal-fired power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/03/24/3763158/scotland-closes-last-coal-plant/|title= Scotland closes last coal plant}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decline has resulted from the replacement of [[Fossil fuel power station|coal-fired electricity]] by gas and renewable energy, along with the decline of the [[steel industry]] in some countries. As a result, the term "peak coal" is now used primarily to refer to a peak and subsequent decline in global and national coal consumption. In 2016 experts estimated that China, the world's largest coal consumer, reached peak coal in 2013, and that the world may have passed peak coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/01/14/3739164/global-coal-peak-2013|title = Global coal peak 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2017, for the first time in four years, demand for coal rose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The world is losing the war against climate change |url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/08/02/the-world-is-losing-the-war-against-climate-change?frsc=dg%7Ce |accessdate=6 August 2018 |date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, China accounted for 50.0 percent of world coal consumption. Chinese coal consumption fell in 2014 and 2015. The last previous decline in Chinese coal consumption had been in 1997 and 1998. While consumption in China and the United States declined in 2015, that of India continued to rise and, in 2015, India surpassed the United States and became the world's second-largest consumer of coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/downloads.html BP Annual Statistical Review of World Energy], 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peak coal production for individual nations ==
[[File:Top 5 Coal Producing Countries.png|thumb|Coal production trends 1980-2012 in the top five coal-producing countries (US EIA)]]

&lt;!-- 90% of the remaining coal is in China, USA, Australia, India, South Africa and Russia --&gt;
As of 2011, the top coal-extracting countries were China (46% of world extraction), United States (13%), India (7.8%), Australia (5.4%), and Indonesia (4.9%).  Four out of five of these largest coal-extracting countries, the exception being the United States, had experienced significant increases in coal extraction over the previous decade.&lt;ref name="eia.doe.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=1&amp;pid=7&amp;aid=1
 | publisher=US Energy Information Agency | title=World coal production | format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===
The [[People's Republic of China]] is the [[coal power in China|world’s largest coal extractor]] and has the third largest reserves after Russia and the United States.  The [[Energy Watch Group]] predicted that the Chinese extraction will peak around 2015 in their 2007 report, and then revised that to 2020 in their March 2013 report.&lt;ref name="ewg2007coal"/&gt;&lt;!-- p27 --&gt;&lt;ref name="EWG_2013"&gt;{{cite web | format=pdf | url=http://energywatchgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EWG-update2013_long_18_03_2013up1.pdf | title=Fossil and Nuclear Fuels – the Supply Outlook | publisher=Energy Watch Group | date=March 2013 | accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EWG also predicts that the recent steep rise in extraction will be followed by a steep decline after 2020. Another study puts the peak at 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/8064|title=The Oil Drum - Peak Coal and China|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Energy Information Administration]] projects that China coal extraction will continue to rise until 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/pdf/coal.pdf | publisher=US Energy Information Administration | title=International Energy Outlook 2008 | page=52 | accessdate=24 January 2009 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Coal Tonnage and BTU.png|thumb|United States annual mined coal tonnage (black) and BTU content (red), 1980-2012, from US EIA.]]
Although Hubbert's analysis in 1956 projected total extraction to peak in about 2150,&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956/&gt; records show that extraction reached an energy peak in 1998 and a tonnage peak in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/|title = US EIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Coal mass ====

US coal extraction peaked during [[World War I]], then declined sharply during the depression years of the 1930s.  Coal extraction peaked again in the 1940s, then declined during the 1950s.&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956/&gt;&lt;!-- p7 --&gt;  Then coal extraction revived, and was on a nearly continual increasing trend from 1962 to 2008, exceeding the previous peaks.  Extraction in 2008 was a record 1.17 billion short tons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pdf/pages/sec7_7.pdf US Energy Information Agency: ''Coal production, selected years, 1949-2007'']&lt;/ref&gt;  High-BTU [[anthracite coal]] peaked in 1914;&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956/&gt;&lt;!-- p7 --&gt; and declined from 44 million tons in 1950 to 1.6 million tons in 2007.  [[Bituminous coal]] extraction has also been declining since 1990.  The gap has been taken up by large increases in subbituminous coal extraction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Comprehensive analysis of historical trends in US coal extraction and reserve estimates, along with a possible future outlook, was published in scientific journals on coal geology in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1=Mikael | last1=Höök | first2=Kjell | last2=Aleklett | year=2009 | url=http://www.tsl.uu.se/uhdsg/Publications/USA_Coal.pdf | title=Historical trends in American coal production and a possible future outlook | publisher=International Journal of Coal Geology | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105093453/http://www.tsl.uu.se/uhdsg/Publications/USA_Coal.pdf | archivedate=5 November 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Hubbert estimated that US coal extraction would peak in about the year 2150.&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956/&gt;&lt;!-- p22 --&gt;   In 2004, Gregson Vaux used the Hubbert model to predict peak US coal extraction in 2032.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/052504_coal_peak.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091008035919/http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/052504_coal_peak.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 October 2009 |title=The Peak in U.S. Coal Production |publisher=From the Wilderness |author=Gregson Vaux |date=27 May 2004 |accessdate=30 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a model published in the ''International Journal of Coal Geology'' forecast a U.S. raw tonnage peak from between 2009 and 2023, with the most likely year of the peak in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reaver|first1=Nathan G.F.|last2=Khare|first2=Sanjay V.|title=Imminence of peak in US coal production and overestimation of reserves|journal=International Journal of Coal Geology|date=September 2014|volume=131|pages=90–105|doi=10.1016/j.coal.2014.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Energetic peak ====

Over the years, the average energy content per ton of coal mined in the US has declined as mining shifts to coals of lower rank. Although the tonnage of coal mined in the United States reached its latest peak in 2008, the peak in terms of coal energy content occurred in 1998, at 598 [[Tonne of oil equivalent|Millions of metric tons of oil equivalent]] (Mtoe); by 2005 this had fallen to 576 Mtoe, or about 4% lower.&lt;ref name="ewg2007coal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinberg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/29919 | publisher=EnergyBulletin.net | title=Peak coal: sooner than you think | first=Richard | last=Heinberg | date=21 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===

[[Australia]] has substantial coal resources, mostly [[brown coal]]. It is responsible for almost 40% of global coal exports worldwide, and much of its current electricity is generated from [[coal-fired power station]]s. There are tentative plans to very slowly phase out coal electricity generation in favor of [[gas]], although these plans are still a topic of much debate in Australian politics.

Long-term plans for coal in Australia include large-scale export of [[brown coal]] to large developing nations such as China and India.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2012/s3503600.htm | work=The 7:30 Report | title=Brown promises allure of gold in new coal economy | date= 15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups such as the [[Australian Greens]], suggest that coal be left in the ground to avoid its potential combustion either in Australia or in importer nations.

Research in 2009 by the University of Newcastle in Australia concluded that Australian coal extraction could peak sometime after 2050.&lt;ref name="newcastle.edu.au"/&gt; While the Australian Coal Association (ACA) optimistically estimates that Australia's identified [[black coal]] resources could last more than 200 years based on rate of extraction in 2007. This does not account for brown coal stocks.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/reserves-to-dry-up-as-clean-coal-becomes-viable/2007/04/09/1175971023057.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Reserves to dry up as clean coal becomes viable | date=10 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New South Wales====
According to calculations conducted for the Hunter Community Environment Centre in Newcastle, the Australian state of [[New South Wales]] 10,600 million tonnes of coal reserves would be exhausted by 2042, based on current industry growth and extraction rates of about 3.2 per cent a year.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Coal output peaked in 1913 in Britain at 287 Mt and now accounts for less than one percent of world coal extraction. 2007 extraction was around 15 Mt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/05/fossilfuels.energy |title=Lump sums |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |author=David Strahan |date=5 March 2008 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
According to the Earth Watch Group, [[Canada|Canadian]] coal extraction peaked in 1997.&lt;ref name="ewg2007coal"/&gt;&lt;!-- p40 --&gt;

===Germany===
[[Germany]] hit peak hard coal extraction in 1958 at 150 million tons.  In 2005 [[Anthracite|hard coal]] extraction was around 25 million tons.&lt;ref name="ewg2007coal"/&gt;&lt;!-- p42 --&gt;
Total coal extraction peaked in 1985 at 578 million short tons, declined sharply in the early 1990s following German reunification, and has been nearly steady since 1999.  Total coal extraction in 2005 was 229 million short tons, four percent of total world extraction.&lt;ref name="eia.doe.gov"/&gt;

===2011  Patzek and Croft===
In 2010, Tadeusz Patzek (chairman of the Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin) and Greg Croft, predicted that coal production would peak in 2011 or shortly thereafter, and decline so quickly as to nearly eliminate the contribution of coal to climate change. Patzek said: "Our ability to produce this resource at 8 billion tons per year, in my mind, is a dream,"&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Reis,

===2150 M. King Hubbert===
M. King Hubbert's 1956 projections from the world extraction curve estimated that world coal production would peak at approximately six billion metric tons per year at about the year 2150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |format=PDF |title=Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels 'Drilling and Production Practice' |author=M.

''Coal: Resources and Future Production'',&lt;ref name="ewg2007coal"/&gt;&lt;!--p 7 --&gt; published on 5 April 2007 by the Energy Watch Group (EWG) found that global coal extraction could peak in as few as 15 years.&lt;ref name=Heinberg200705&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |title=Peak coal: sooner than you think |publisher=Energy Bulletin |author=Richard Heinberg |date=21 May 2007 |accessdate=6 June 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080522155229/http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the graphs in their 2013 report show a peak in 2020.&lt;ref name="EWG_2013" /&gt; Reporting on this, Richard Heinberg also notes that the date of peak annual energetic extraction from coal will likely come earlier than the date of peak in quantity of coal (tons  per year) extracted as the most energy-dense types of coal have been mined most extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richardheinberg.com/museletter/179 |title=burn the furniture | publisher=Richard Heinberg |author=Richard Heinberg |date=March 2007 | accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute for Energy===
''The Future of Coal'' by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy (IFE), prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre, reached conclusions similar to those of Energy Watch Group, and stated that "coal might not be so abundant, widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future".&lt;ref name=Heinberg200705/&gt;  Kavalov and Peteves did not attempt to forecast a peak in extraction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20146">The '''Chile Pension system''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Sistema Previsional'') refers to old-age, disability and survivor [[pension]]s for workers in [[Chile]]. The pension system was changed by [[José Piñera]], during [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s [[Military government of Chile (1973–90)|dictatorship]], on November 4, 1980 from a [[PAYGO]]-system to a fully funded capitalization system run by [[private sector]] [[pension fund]]s. Many critics and supporters see the reform as an important experiment under real conditions, that may give conclusions about the impact of the full conversion of a PAYGO-system to a capital funded system. The development was therefore internationally observed with great interest. Under [[Michelle Bachelet]]'s government the Chile Pension system was reformed again.

== Pension system of 1926 ==
[[File:Arturo Alessandri-1920.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The first pension system of Chile was designed during the first presidency of [[Arturo Alessandri]].]]
A social security system was introduced in Chile in the 1920s, which included a PAYGO pension system. By 1973 the funding of the pension fund was low, though 73% of all Chilean workers paid into the system. The reason for this was that almost all workers contributed only the statutory minimum contribution, and many successfully evaded pension contributions. The poor payment record is attributed primarily to the fact that individual contributions had little correlation with anticipated pension benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Joaquin Vial Ruiz-Tagle, Francisca Castro, The Chilean Pension System, [[OECD]] Ageing Working Papers, 1998, Seite 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pension reform of 1980-81 ==
[[File:Pinochet 11-09-1982.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Pinochet in 1982.]]
On November 4, 1980, under the leadership of [[José Piñera]], Secretary of Labor and Pensions under [[Augusto Pinochet]] with the collaboration of his team of [[Chicago Boys]], the PAYGO pension system was changed to a capital funded system run by investment funds.&lt;ref name="Joaquin Vial Ruiz-Tagle 1998, page 6"&gt;Joaquin Vial Ruiz-Tagle, Francisca Castro, The Chilean Pension System, [[OECD]] Ageing Working Papers, 1998, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; José Piñera had the idea of privatizing the pension system for the first time when reading the book [[Capitalism and Freedom]] from [[Milton Friedman]]&lt;ref&gt;Kristian Niemitz, Die kapitalgedeckte Altersvorsorge am Beispiel Chile, DiplomicaVerlag GmbH, Hamburg, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-8366-5903-1}}, page 32&lt;/ref&gt; There have been implemented several (private) [[pension fund]]s the so-called ''Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones'' (AFPs). For all citizens who are legally defined as workers, employers must pay a proportion of the earnings to a pension fund. Workers who had already paid in the old system, got an option to continue to pay into the old system. But the statutory minimum contribution to the new private pension funds was set 11% lower than the contributions to the old pension system, therefore most workers changed to the new pension system.&lt;ref name="Joaquin Vial Ruiz-Tagle 1998, page 6"/&gt;

Chilean military that implemented the new AFP system excluded themselves from it keeping obtaining their pensions from the [[Caja de Previsión de la Defensa Nacional]].&lt;ref name=Urquieta&gt;{{Citation

=== Overview ===
The Chilean workers yearly contributions in the private pension fund are amounting to about 3.5% of gross domestic product. The pension payments from the pension funds are still relatively low, mainly because yet just a few depositors have reached the retirement age. Until 2008 the private pension funds have accumulated capital of an amount of 52.77% of gross domestic product.

==== Government's responsibility ====
The establishment and the operation of the private pension funds are regulated by law. For example any pension fund must deposit minimum reserves. The types of investments that are permitted are defined by law. The compliance of the private pension funds are supervised by a government regulator, the ''Superintendencia de AFP,'' now called ''Superintendencia de Pensiones''.&lt;ref&gt;Joaquin Vial Ruiz-Tagle, Francisca Castro, The Chilean Pension System, [[OECD]] Ageing Working Papers 1998, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

There are government guarantees for the following cases:&lt;ref&gt;Joaquin Vial Ruiz-Tagle, Francisca Castro, The Chilean Pension System, [[OECD]] Ageing Working Papers, 1998, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;
# All citizens who have contributed to a fund for at least 20 years are guaranteed a minimum pension. The difference between the minimum pension and the pension entitlement from the investment fund is paid by government.
# If a pension fund is unable to perform a defined minimum profit, it will be liquidated and the collected assets will be transferred to another fund. In this case, the government solves the assets gap.
# In case of [[bankruptcy]] of a pension fund the government pays out the pensions on public expenses.

The government pays a fixed amount as [[social assistance]] for those citizens who are not even entitled to minimum pension, the ''Pensiones Asistenciales'' (PASIS). But the provided amount of money is usually not nearly big enough to cover all people in need. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Because of the conversion from the PAYGO to the funded system until the year 2045 there will arise conversion costs. Because the contributions are made almost entirely in the new system, there are almost no more payments into the old system. The difference between the remaining contributions and the pensions that have to be paid out have to be financed by the Chilean government. These conversion costs are a big burden for the government budget:&lt;ref&gt;Joaquin Vial Ruiz-Tagle, Francisca Castro, The Chilean Pension System, [[OECD]] Ageing Working Papers, 1998, Seite 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Contributors ====
All workers and employees must pay into the system. Mandatory contributions amount to 10% of the monthly income, the part of the monthly income that exceeds $2,800 U.S. (60 UF) is  non-contributory. Self-employed individuals may contribute voluntarily, and salaried workers can also enhance their pension through additional voluntary contributions. The [[Military of Chile|Chilean armed forces]] and [[Carabineros de Chile|police]] do not contribute in the workers pension system but participate in a separate PAYGO system.&lt;ref&gt;Willem Adema, Anders Reuterswärd, Veerle Slootmaekers, [[OECD]] Reviews of Labour Market and Social Policies. Chile, OECD, 2009, page 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Chilean Pension System. Superintendency of Pension Fund Administrators . Fourth edition.  May 2003. {{cite web |url=http://www.safp.cl/573/articles-3523_chapter4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718093430/http://www.safp.cl/573/articles-3523_chapter4.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-18 |df= }} page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The pension contributions are [[income tax]] [[Tax deduction|deductible]].&lt;ref&gt;Joaquin Vial Ruiz-Tagle, Francisca Castro, The Chilean Pension System, [[OECD]] Ageing Working Papers, 1998, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The worker can choose one of six private pension administrators and change at will and also choose from among five funds (A to E, with A being the riskiest).

==== Administrative costs ====
The pension funds are privately administered. The amount of administrative costs are not regulated by law. But there is two years obligation for a new affiliated to be included in a single found, selected by public bidding, based in the level of administrative costs. The user contribute to his pension with a contribution of 10% of income. In addition, the user pays administrative costs in the order of 1% of income. The user don´t pay any cost while unemployed.

==== Coverage ====
The performance of the Chilean pension funds is not very good compared with the performance of private pension funds of [[developed country|developed countries]], but that performance is partly attributed to special factors.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Jäger, Die Privatisierung des Pensionssystems in Lateinamerika: Ursachen und Folgen des Experiments in Chile, Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien, 1998, Seite 9&lt;/ref&gt;. The amount of administrative costs is considered a problem of the Chilean pension system.&lt;ref&gt;Joaquin Vial Ruiz-Tagle, Francisca Castro, The Chilean Pension System, [[OECD]] Ageing Working Papers, 1998, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to or instead of the regular private pension workers may be entitled to state aid:

Retired workers whose private pensions are below a defined level are entitled to minimum pension ''(Garantía de Pensión Mínima).'' In this case, the government pays an additional pension.&lt;ref name="Joaquin Vial Ruiz-Tagle 1998, page 8"&gt;Joaquin Vial Ruiz-Tagle, Francisca Castro, The Chilean Pension System, [[OECD]] Ageing Working Papers, 1998, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

People who have paid in nothing or contributed less than 20 years may get social assistance, the ''Pensiones Asistenciales (PASIS)''. But the Pensiones Asistenciales are paid from a fixed budget that is usually not big enough to cover everyone in need.&lt;ref&gt;Willem Adema, Anders Reuterswärd, Veerle Slootmaekers, [[OECD]] Reviews of Labour Market and Social Policies: Chile, OECD, 2009, page 145&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of workers who actually pay into the pension system decreased from 64% in 1980 (before the reform) to 58% by 2006 &lt;ref&gt;[[OECD]]: Latin American Economic Outlook 2008, {{ISBN|978-92-64-03826-4}}, 2007, page 70&lt;/ref&gt; According to Patricio Navia an Diego Portales University professor, most people perceive the costs of pensions and the pensions themselves as unfair. Therefore they try to evade pension contributions.

Andras Uthoff, the director of the ''Social Development Division'' of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America ([[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|ECLAC]]) states that the reformed Chilean pension system does not work with the reformed Chilean labor market because only a small percentage of workers are able to finance meaningful pensions.

According to the projection of Berstein, Larrain and Pino Rios from the year 2005 (based on data from the period 1981 - 2003) the kind of pensions to expect are predicted as following:&lt;ref&gt;Guillermo Larrain Rois, Enhancing the Success of the Chilean Pension System in: A Quarter Century of Pension Reform in Latin America and the Caribbean, Inter American Development Bank, Washington, 2005, {{ISBN|1-59782-020-2}}, page 235&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sebastián Piñera]], the brother of José Piñera and later president of Chile, said during the presidential candidacy in 2006:
{{Quote | Chile's social security system requires deep reforms in all sectors, because half of Chileans have no pension coverage, and of those who do, 40 percent are going to find it hard to reach the minimum level. This has to be confronted now, and we agree with Michelle Bachelet and will, I hope, join forces behind this large undertaking. | Sebastián Piñera in a televised debate with Michelle Bachelet in 2006 &lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[[The New York Times|New York Times]]: [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/10/world/americas/10iht-chile.html?_r=2 Chile rethinks its privatized pension system]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Pension reform of 2008 ==
[[File:Velasco1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Velasco during the ceremony of assumption as Finance Minister of Chile in March 2006]]
Under the [[Michelle Bachelet|Bachelet]] government, the pension system was reformed again in the year 2008. Andrés Velasco, the leading economic adviser to the government, addressed the two main problems as the coverage of the population and the amount of the administrative costs. Too many people are outside the pension system, and [[capital accumulation]] by using the pension funds is quite expensive&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The reform follows a recommendation by the [[World Bank]], who has found in the 1980 pension system a strong redistributive component at the expense of low paid or occasionally unemployed workers. A big part of the Chilean population is not able to finance meaningful pensions, because many workers are not able to regularly contribute a higher amount of money. Additionally many workers have difficulties to achieve the 20 years of contributions to at least qualify for minimum pension. Since the pension funds charge high fixed administrative costs per insured person and only a small portion of the administrative costs depend on the amount of the capital account, capital accumulation by pension funds is very unprofitable for workers with lower incomes. The World Bank therefore recommended that the minimum pension and the Pensiones Asistenciales should be abolished and instead introduced a public risk pooling device financed by [[VAT]] tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;A World Bank Country Study. Household Risk Management and Social Protection in Chile, [[World Bank|The World Bank]], Washington DC, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8213-5953-3}}, page 65&lt;/ref&gt;

The reform includes mainly the following points:&lt;ref&gt;[[OECD]]: Latin American Economic Outlook 2008, {{ISBN|978-92-64-03826-4}}, 2007, page 71, 72&lt;/ref&gt;
* The minimum pension and the Pensiones Asistenciales were replaced by a tax-funded solidary pension system (SPS). All citizens older than 65 years, that lived in Chile for at least 20 years and do not have a private pension on a defined minimum level qualify for an SPS pension.
* The legally defined framework within which pension fund investments are allowed has been extended.
* Within a transitional period lasting until 2015, self-employed individuals are also to be integrated into the pension system.

'''[[Polygamy]]''' is illegal in '''[[Burundi]]''' and the nation does not recognize polygamous marriages under civil law or customary law. A 1993 [[Law|amendment]] to the Code of Person and Family officially abolished polygamy in the country.

'''Teen Challenge''' (now named "Adult &amp; Teen Challenge")&lt;ref name="teenchallengeusa.com"/&gt; is a worldwide network of Christian faith-based corporations intended to help teenagers, adults, and families with problems such as substance abuse or self-destructive behavior. It was founded by [[David Wilkerson]] in 1960. U.S. headquarters are located in Ozark, Missouri.  It has over 1,000 centers worldwide.

==History==
The ministry that would later become Teen Challenge (and in 2017 changed to "Adult &amp; Teen Challenge")&lt;ref name="teenchallengeusa.com"/&gt; was founded in 1960 by [[David Wilkerson]], an Assemblies of God pastor who left a rural Pennsylvania church to work on the street among teenage gang members and socially marginalized people in [[New York City]] and who, perhaps, is best known for later authoring [[The Cross and the Switchblade]] and founding [[Times Square Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall Herbert Balmer, ''Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism'', Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2002, page 677&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher D. Ringwald, ''Principles of Addiction: Comprehensive Addictive Behaviors and Disorders, Volume 1'', Academic Press, USA, 2013, page  289&lt;/ref&gt; Teen Challenge started its first residential program in December 1960, in a house of [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="teenchallengeusa.com"&gt;https://www.teenchallengeusa.com/about/history&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, 15 years after the ministry began, Teen Challenge established a national headquarters.&lt;ref name="teenchallengeusa.com"/&gt;

In 1995, Global Teen Challenge was founded to assist the growing number of Teen Challenges starting up outside the US, but struggling to acquire the necessary resources and training.&lt;ref name="teenchallengeusa.com"/&gt;

In 2017, the organization officially changed its name to Adult &amp; Teen Challenge, to eliminate confusion in regard to the fact that the organization not only works with teenagers but also works with adults in its addiction treatment centers.&lt;ref name="teenchallengeusa.com"/&gt;

==Mission==
The official [[Mission Statement|Statement of Purpose]] of Adult and Teen Challenge is, "To provide youth, adults and families with an effective and comprehensive Christian faith-based solution to life-controlling problems, such as substance abuse, in order to become productive members of society. By applying biblical principles, Teen Challenge endeavors to help people become mentally-sound, emotionally-balanced, socially-adjusted, physically-well, and spiritually-alive."&lt;ref&gt;http://teenchallengeusa.com/about&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
While the residential model continue to be the primary service of Teen Challenges around the world, an increasing number of community small groups and other non-residential models are also used.

===Adult &amp; Teen Challenge USA===
Adult and Teen Challenge USA is an independent [[501(c) organization|501(c)3]] nonprofit headquartered in Ozark, Missouri. Its current President is Joe Batluck. Though self-governing, it also exists as a department of the U.S. Missions division of the [[Assemblies of God USA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://usmissions.ag.org&lt;/ref&gt; The US network consisting of ~85 [[501(c) organization|501(c)3]] corporations representing ~200 residential programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://teenchallengeusa.com/centers?type=all_residential&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult and Teen Challenge USA maintains accreditation standards, curriculum, training and resources to all Teen Challenge organizations within the United States and Puerto Rico.

Each individual US corporation is self-governing, though TC USA does require a minimum set of accreditation standards be met to be able to function as an "Adult and Teen Challenge" affiliate.

===Global Teen Challenge===
Global Teen Challenge is an independent [[501(c) organization|501(c)3]] nonprofit headquartered in Columbus, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globaltc.org/html/location.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714141235/http://globaltc.org/html/location.html |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of Global Teen Challenge is to assist with the development of new centers outside the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globaltc.org/html/mission_and_vision.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714171620/http://globaltc.org/html/mission_and_vision.html |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they also provide resources and training to the existing programs.

In 2017, Global Teen Challenge is in 110 countries representing 1100 programs.&lt;ref&gt;Teen Challenge, [http://globaltc.org/our-story/ Our Story] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108191556/http://globaltc.org/our-story/ |date=2017-01-08 }}, Official Website, USA, Retrieved January 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Global Teen Challenge is divided into regions with a director or representative for each region. 
Regional directors are listed at https://globaltc.org/meet-our-team/

== Core Structure of Programs ==
Programs have a general duration of 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher D. Ringwald, ''The Soul of Recovery: Uncovering the Spiritual Dimension in the Treatment of Addictions'', Oxford University Press, UK, 2002, page  138&lt;/ref&gt;

The ATC-USA Board of Directors approved a "Phase" system to explain core structures of Teen Challenge.  All centers of any Phase are expected to be involved in Phase 1.  The phase ministry is as follows:

*'''Phase 1''' - Recognition of destructive and habitual thoughts that lead to substance abuse.
*'''Phase 2''' - Focus on healing the wounds of past failures and broken relationships.
*'''Phase 3''' - Character development and spiritual growth with a discovery process identifying personal strengths and setting individual goals.
*'''Phase 4''' - Continuing Care Planning includes employment/educational plans, housing, financial planning, relationship skills, support system evaluation, leadership skills and relapse prevention. This may or may not be residential, but generally these centers involve Phase 1 activity, as well as providing pastoral counseling and referral.  Many of these ministries also coordinate or directly provide the non-residential expression of Teen Challenge: Living Free (formerly Turning Point).  Living Free is small groups based.  The Crisis centers that are residential are typically very short term until a more permanent discipleship bed can be located.
*'''Phase 5''' - Re-entry - generally for those graduates needing additional assistance in education, transitional housing, securing jobs or job skills, but can involve other reasons.
*'''Phase 6''' - Restoration - for graduates who have returned to old behavior patterns.  Phase 6 is a rare ministry as a center, and is more often co-located with a Phase 4.

Another major component of the Adult and Teen Challenge structure is the curriculum created by Dave Batty.  This is known as the ''Group Studies for New Christians'' and the ''Personal Studies for New Christians''.

== Studies of program effectiveness ==
In 1973, Archie Johnston compared results of Teen Challenge with that of a [[transactional analysis]] approach at a Terminal Island Federal Correctional Institution therapeutic community, and with a third group who received no treatment.

While the numbers of subjects was small (17 in each group), he found evidence to support his recommendation that, while Teen Challenge was an "effective" treatment (with a drug recidivism rate after 29 months of 32%), Transactional Analysis was a "very effective" treatment (with a comparable 16% rate), suggesting that perhaps the lower recidivism rates were a result of TA changing the addiction concept of the self-image more thoroughly and at a slower pace. He hoped that Teen Challenge would incorporate some psychotherapy into their treatment model.&lt;ref Name="TA"&gt;{{cite web | last = Johnston| first = Archie
| authorlink = | title = Heroin Addiction: Teen Challenge vs. Transactional Analysis: A Statistical Study| work = | publisher = Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation| date = September 1973| url = http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1973/JASA9-73Johnston.html | doi = | accessdate = 2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Wilder Research study of 154 former residents who graduated between 2007 and 2009 reported that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mntc.org/sites/www.mntc.org/files/pdf-uploads/MnTC%20Wilder%20Study%20Summary%202010.pdf  Wilder research, Minnesota Teen Challenge follow-up Study - January 2011]  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*74 percent of adult program graduates reported no use in the previous six months 
*58 percent had attended school since graduating
*77 percent were either working 30+ hours a week or were a full-time student
*80+ percent rated the overall quality of MnTC as “outstanding” or “very good.” 
*When asked to name what helped most, the faith-based aspects of the program were mentioned most frequently.

Aaron Bicknese tracked down 59 former Teen Challenge students in 1995, in order to compare them with a similar group of addicts who had spent one or two months in a hospital rehabilitation program. His results, part of his PhD dissertation, were published in "The Teen Challenge Drug Treatment Program in Comparative Perspective" &lt;ref Name="Bicknese"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bicknese| first = Aaron | authorlink = | title = The Teen Challenge Drug Treatment Program in Comparative Perspective| publisher = Northwestern University| year = 1999| location = Illinois| pages = | url = | doi = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicknese found that Teen Challenge graduates reported returning to drug use less often than the hospital program graduates.  His results also showed that Teen Challenge graduates were far more likely to be employed, with 18 of the 59 working at Teen Challenge itself, which relies in part on former clients to run the program.

Much of these results were to Teen Challenge's benefit, and the high success rates (up to 86%) he found have been quoted in numerous Teen Challenge and Christian Counseling websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acadc.citymax.com/page/page/2495014.htm|title=Significant research that everybody should know|accessdate=2009-01-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221065833/http://www.acadc.citymax.com/page/page/2495014.htm|archivedate=2009-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2001 New York Times item,&lt;ref Name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web | last = Goodstein| first = Laurie| authorlink = | title =  Church-Based Projects Lack Data on Results| work = | publisher = New York Times| date = 2001-04-24| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EED61F30F937A15757C0A9679C8B63| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; some social scientists complain that the 86 percent success rate of Teen Challenge disregards the people who dropped out during the program, even though most other such programs also count only those who complete their program. Since Teen Challenge is a longer term program, often lasting up to a year, more people do pull out than do in programs that are a few days to a few weeks long. So, counting dropouts could also fail to show the true effectiveness of the program, since those individuals didn't complete the program and gain the full effectiveness of it.  Teen Challenge reports that in the program's first four-month phase, 25 to 30 percent typically drop out, and in the next eight months, 10 percent more leave. In their testimony before the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]], [[Texas Freedom Network]] Education Fund, have claimed that the much-quoted success rates "dramatically distort the truth", due to the lack of reference to the drop-out rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/legacy/humres/107cong/6-14-01/6-14smoo.htm|title=Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Human Resources and Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures of the House Committee on Ways and Means|date=2001-06-14|publisher=House Committee on Ways and Means|accessdate=2009-01-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112035516/http://waysandmeans.house.gov/legacy/humres/107cong/6-14-01/6-14smoo.htm|archivedate=2009-01-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doug Wever, author of, "The Teen Challenge Therapeutic Model" has stated, "I would respectfully suggest that the Texas Freedom Network's position here is overstated in that it's not unusual at all for the research design of effectiveness studies to look only at graduates; therefore the outcomes of these independent studies do provide a legitimate and dramatic basis for comparison given the results.  At the same time, Teen Challenge must be careful to communicate what has actually been measured."&lt;ref&gt;Doug Wever of Alabama Teen Challenge and Global Teen Challenge in an interview, June 2009, Seale, AL&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public policy effects==
In 1995, auditors from the Texas Commission for Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA) demanded that Teen Challenge obtain state licensing and employ state-licensed counselors. As a result, (then) Governor George W. Bush publicly defended Teen Challenge and pursued alternative licensing procedures for faith-based organizations. ''“Teen Challenge should view itself as a pioneer in how Texas approaches faith-based programs. I’ll call together people, ask them to make recommendations... licensing standards have to be different from what they are today,”'' then-Governor Bush said.&lt;ref Name="World"&gt;{{cite web | last = Maynard| first = Roy | authorlink = |author2=Marvin Olasky | date= 08-05-1995 | title = Governor Bush backs Teen Challenge | publisher = World Magazine |url=http://www.worldmag.com/articles/11016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush then created a state Task Force on Faith-Based Programs, to identify and lift regulatory barriers for faith-based social service providers.[https://web.archive.org/web/20030316133310/http://www.twc.state.tx.us/svcs/charchoice/faithful.pdf] The task force included J. Herbert Meppelink, the Executive Director of South Texas Teen Challenge.[https://web.archive.org/web/20030316133310/http://www.twc.state.tx.us/svcs/charchoice/faithful.pdf] The resultant 1997 and 1999 Texas legislation exempted Faith-Based Programs, such as Teen Challenge, from state licensing and the health, safety and quality of care standards that accompany that licensing.

Later, when Bush became US president, Teen Challenge was cited in public policy debates as an example of why such programs merit the federal funding of faith-based organizations. Its documented success rates played a role in the establishment of the [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives]] in 2001.

Conversely, such funding has come under attack through comments by John Castellani, the former President of Teen Challenge USA, during a House Government Reform subcommittee, examining the efficacy of religious social service providers. During the hearing, Castellani said Teen Challenge does not hire non-Christians as employees and, when asked if the group takes non-Christians as clients, he said yes, and boasted that some Jews who finish his Teen Challenge program become "completed Jews." &lt;ref Name="AU"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Faith-Based Group Draws Criticism for Telling House Congressional Committee about "Completed Jews"| work =| publisher =Americans United for Separation of Church and State| date =2001-05-24| url =http://www.au.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=6061&amp;abbr=pr&amp;security=1002&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1379| format =| doi =| accessdate =2008-04-01| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080513090856/http://www.au.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=6061&amp;abbr=pr&amp;security=1002&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1379| archive-date =2008-05-13| dead-url =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="NYT2"&gt;{{cite web| last = Goodstein| first = Laurie| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01EED71E3DF936A15756C0A9679C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/J/Jews%20and%20Judaism | title = A Reference to Jews Heats Up Aid Debate |publisher= New York Times | date =2001-05-25 |page= A19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of faith-based funding cite this as an example of how  religious intolerance could be publicly funded.[http://waysandmeans.house.gov/Legacy/humres/107cong/6-14-01/record/foltin.htm#8] (The "completed Jews" phrase has been used by some Christians and Messianic Jews to refer to people who previously followed Judaism and have become believers in Yeshua (Jesus).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1814">'''Tepetlaoztoc''' or '''Tepetlaoxtoc''' ([[Nahuatl]] for "[[tepetate]]-cave place", {{audio|Tepetlaostok.ogg|modern Nahuatl pronunciation}}) is an [[archaeological site]] located in the Central Mexico plateau region of [[Mesoamerica]], which was an [[Aztec]]/[[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] settlement during the Late Postclassic period of [[Mesoamerican chronology]], with an occupancy continuing through the Colonial period. The site is situated in the [[Valley of Mexico]], to the northeast of [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]].

In the 1970s the area was relatively undeveloped, and one could, on [[aerial photograph]]s, still discern the 16th century field lines and [[irrigation]] system drawn in the [[Códice de Santa María Asunción|Codex of Santa María Asunción]] (manuscript in the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España|Biblioteca Nacional]]) and the Codex Vergara. Likewise one could locate many of the [[Hamlet (place)|aldeas]] that were tributary to Tepetlaoztoc, and still find the wall bases of their houses. By the time of [[William T. Sanders]]'s work in the 1990s, development had largely destroyed these remnants.

Since sexual intercourse for money is officially prohibited, the sex industry in [[Japan]] has developed into a variety of forms. Soaplands are bath houses where customers are soaped up and serviced by staff. Fashion health shops and pink salons are notionally massage or esthetic treatment parlors; image clubs are themed versions of the same. [[Call girl]]s operate via delivery health services. Freelancers can get in contact with potential customers via ''deai sites'' (Internet dating sites), and the actual act of prostitution is legally called ''[[enjo kōsai]]'' or "compensated dating" to avoid legal trouble.

==Delivery health==
'''{{nihongo|Delivery health|デリバリーヘルス|Deribarii herusu}}''', also known as "shutchō health" (出張ヘルス) or by the abbreviation "deriheru" (デリヘル), is a form of prostitution in Japan similar to fashion health, "health" being a term for sexual services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Queer Japan from the Pacific war to the internet age|series=Asian voices|first=Mark J.|last=McLelland|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7425-3787-3 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference being that the brothel has no premises and is essentially a call girl (or "escort service") with women being dispatched to their customers' homes or to hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Goodbye Mme. B.: sex, marriage and the modern Japanese woman|first=Sumie|last=Kawakami|editor1-first=Bruce|editor1-last=Rutledge|publisher=Chin Music Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-9741995-3-5 |page=v}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Black Passenger Yellow Cabs: Of Exile and Excess in Japan|first=Stefhen Fd|last=Bryan|editor1-first=Susette|editor1-last=Burton|publisher=Kimama Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-615-26810-1 |page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outcall call girl businesses distribute advertising handouts to home and apartment mailboxes, [[telephone booth]]s, [[restroom]]s and the like in big cities in Japan.  There are also numerous websites to find these businesses or other similar businesses.

==Fashion health==
'''{{nihongo|Fashion health|ファッションヘルス|fasshon herusu}}''', or health for short, is a form of [[massage parlor]] which circumvents Japanese anti-prostitution laws by offering a range of services that stop short of sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="japantimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hongo|first1=Jun|title=Law bends over backward to allow 'fuzoku'|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/05/27/news/law-bends-over-backward-to-allow-fuzoku/#.WrbD3IjFKM8|website=The Japan Times Online|accessdate=24 March 2018|date=27 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashion-health clubs can be found in all large cities in Japan and are easy to spot because of their bright flashing lights and garish [[decor]]. Often advertised as "health clubs", they may confuse foreigners unfamiliar with the activities inside. These clubs usually post pictures of their so-called [[masseuse]]s near the entrance; however, sometimes faces and eyes are censored with pixellation or black strips. Some club entrances feature [[caricature]]d depictions of the services provided.

==Image club==
An '''{{nihongo|image club|イメージクラブ|imējikurabu}}''', or {{nihongo|imekura|イメクラ|}}, is a type of brothel in Japan similar to fashion health parlors.  They differ in that image clubs are themed along popular [[sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]] such as an office, a doctor's surgery, a classroom, or a train carriage.  The prostitutes themselves, whose activities are usually limited to oral sex, wear exaggerated costumes appropriate to the setting and the desire of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas|title=A Plain School Uniform as the Latest Aphrodisiac|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/02/world/a-plain-school-uniform-as-the-latest-aphrodisiac.html|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=2 April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Image clubs simulating molestation of female train passengers became popular in the wake of stricter enforcement of laws against [[groping]] on trains.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Gaby|title=Sex and the city|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/apr/01/features.magazine37|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Image clubs may offer itemized pricing for particular services such as taking instant photographs, removing a woman's underwear or taking it home.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Women working at image clubs are paid around 30,000 to 35,000 yen per day and may make more than 1 million yen per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sex-service recruit rags sizzle in summer|url=http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2008/08/01/sex-service-recruit-rags-sizzle-in-summer/|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=The Tokyo Reporter|date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pink salon==
A '''{{Nihongo|pink salon|ピンクサロン|pinkusaron}}''', or ''{{Nihongo|pinsaro|ピンサロ|}}'' for short, is a type of brothel in Japan which specialises in oral sex.

Pink salons skirt laws against prostitution by serving food, operating without showers or private rooms, and limiting the services provided to [[fellatio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockitreports.com/blowjob-bars-around-the-world-where-they-are-how-they-work/|title=Blowjob bars around the world: Where they are, how they work|publisher=Rockit Reports|date=November 19, 2012|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be additional activities such as [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] the "companion" and sumata. They exist all over Japan and women who work in them may service a dozen or more men per shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockitreports.com/interview-with-a-japanese-blowjob-bar-pink-salonpinsaro-worker/ |title=Interview with a Japanese Blowjob Bar (Pink Salon/Pinsaro) Worker|publisher=Rockit Reports|date=November 21, 2012|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soapland==
'''{{nihongo|Soapland|ソープランド|sōpurando}}''', or ''sōpu'', is a [[Wasei-eigo|Japanglish]] word constructed from the two [[English language|English]] words "[[soap]]" and "land" and is part of Japan's nighttime entertainment industry, also known as [[Mizu shōbai]].&lt;ref name="japantimes" /&gt; 

There are various kinds of soaplands, and they are usually located in complexes with varying numbers of soaplands. Well-known complexes are located in [[Susukino]] in [[Sapporo]], [[Yoshiwara]] and [[Kabukicho]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], Kanazuen in [[Gifu]], Ogoto in [[Shiga]], and Fukuhara in [[Kobe]], Sagaminumata in [[Odawara]], and [[Nakasu]] in [[Fukuoka]], but there are many other areas, especially in ''[[onsen]]'' ("hot springs") towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Takahashi|first1=Amy|title=Japan's erotic onsen offerings losing steam but still rise to occasion|url=https://www.tokyoreporter.com/2011/01/16/japans-erotic-onsen-offerings-losing-steam-but-still-rise-to-occasion/|website=The Tokyo Reporter|accessdate=24 March 2018|date=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the main clientele for soaplands are males, there are also a few soaplands specifically for female clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Mente|first=Boyé Lafayette|authorlink=Boyé Lafayette De Mente|date=15 November 2006|title=Sex and the Japanese: The Sensual Side of Japan|url= |location=Rutland, Vermont, USA|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|page=58|isbn=978-0-8048-3826-9|oclc=71239207|chapter=Chapter 8: Love Hotels &amp; Massage Parlors|lccn=2009417728}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices for a session at a soapland vary depending on location, time of day, rank of provider, and length of the session.

===Legal loophole===
Although any sex between 'unspecified persons' is prohibited, it is not between 'specified persons' (acquaintances). In his book, “Fuzoku Eigyo Torishimari” (“Control of Sex Business Operations”), [[Kansai University]] professor Yoshikazu Nagai, documents that Soaplands exploit this to provide intercourse. The customers pay an entry fee to 'use the bathing facilities' and a separate fee to the masseuse. Whilst the massage takes place, the two become 'acquainted' so any paid sexual services that follow are not viewed as prostitution as defined by the law. This interpretation of the law has been in use since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="japantimes" /&gt;

===Origins===
Soaplands began when explicit prostitution in Japan became illegal in 1958, as a simple form of bath where women washed men's bodies. They were originally known as ''toruko-buro'', meaning [[Turkish bath]]. Following a 1984 campaign by Turkish scholar Nusret Sancaklı ([[:ja:ヌスレット・サンジャクリ|JA]], [[:tr:Nusret Sancaklı|TR]]) denouncing the use of this name for brothels, the new name "soapland" was the winning entry in a nationwide contest to rename them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Constantine|first=Peter|author-link=Peter Constantine|date=1993|title=Japan's Sex Trade: A Journey Through Japan's Erotic Subcultures|location=Tokyo|publisher=Yenbooks|pages=37–38|isbn=978-4-900737-00-6|oclc=37135004|edition=1st|chapter=Chapter 2: Soaplands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sumata==
'''{{Nihongo|Sumata|素股||"bare [[crotch]]"}}'''&lt;ref name="daijisen" /&gt; (sometimes known in the West as a ''pussyjob'') is a Japanese term for a [[Non-penetrative sex|non-penetrative]] [[Human sexual activity|sex act]] popular in Japanese brothels.  It is a form of [[Non-penetrative sex#Frottage|frottage]] performed by a female [[sex worker]] upon a male client. The sex worker rubs the client's [[penis]] with her thighs ([[intercrural sex]]) and [[labia majora]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantine, Peter. ''Japan's Sex Trade: A Journey Through Japan's Erotic Subcultures''. Tokyo: Yenbooks, 1993, p. 75. {{ISBN|978-4-900737-00-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daijisen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/素股|script-title=ja:素股|website=[[Daijisen]]|language=Japanese |accessdate=2012-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to stimulate [[ejaculation]] without penile-vaginal [[sexual penetration|penetration]]. This activity circumvents the {{nihongo|Anti-Prostitution Law|売春防止法|Baishun-bōshi-hō}} of 1956, which prohibits sexual intercourse for money.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] (Hōmushō), ''Materials Concerning Prostitution and Its Control in Japan''.

'''U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement''' (formally, the "Agreement under Article VI of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States of America, Regarding Facilities and Areas and the Status of United States Armed Forces in Japan") is an agreement between Japan and the United States signed on 19 January 1960 in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], the same day as the revised [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|U.S.-Japan Security Treaty]]. It is a [[status of forces agreement]] (SOFA) as stipulated in article VI of that treaty, which referred to "a separate agreement" governing the "use of [...] facilities and areas [granted to the U.S.] as well as the status of [[United States Forces Japan|United States armed forces in Japan]]". It replaced the earlier "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement" that governed such issues under the original 1951 [[Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan|security treaty]].

The SOFA has become a major political issue following instances of violent crimes allegedly committed by servicemembers.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Eric, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120731i1.html SOFA a source of sovereign conflicts]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 31 July 2012, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Japanese court system has jurisdiction for most crimes committed by American servicemembers in Japan, there are exceptions if the American was "acting in official duty," or if the victim was another American.  In those cases the American system has jurisdiction, unless it is voluntarily waived.

Additionally, some idiosyncrasies of the agreement create areas of perceived privilege for American servicemembers.  For instance, because the SOFA exempts most U.S. military members from Japanese visa and passport laws, past incidents occurred in which U.S. military members were transferred back to the U.S. before facing charges in Japanese courts.  Furthermore, the agreement requires that if a U.S. servicemember is suspected of a crime but is not captured outside of a base by the Japanese authorities, the U.S. authorities are to retain custody until the servicemember is formally indicted by the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;"The custody of an accused member of the United States armed forces or the civilian component over whom Japan is to exercise jurisdiction shall, if he is in the hands of the United States, remain with the United States until he is charged by Japan."  U.S.-Japan SOFA, Article 17, Paragraph 5(c)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the agreement also requires U.S. cooperation with Japanese authorities with investigations,&lt;ref&gt;"The military authorities of the United States and the authorities of Japan shall assist each other in the carrying out of all necessary investigations into offenses . . ."  U.S. – Japan SOFA, Article 17, Para. 6(a)&lt;/ref&gt; the Japanese authorities often object that they still do not have regular access to question or interrogate U.S. servicemembers, making it difficult for Japanese prosecutors to prepare cases for indictment.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{Citation

''Nemesis''. Macmillan, 2006. p 180.&lt;/ref&gt; and can last as long as 23 days.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Timothy D, U.S.-Japan SOFA: A Necessary Document Worth Preserving, 53 Naval L. Rev. 229, 241 (2006).  The police are required to transfer a case to the prosecutor within 48 hours of arrest.  Japan Code of Criminal Procedure 203.  The prosecutor must release within 24 hours of receiving the case from the police, unless he receives a court order granting him more time to interrogate.  Japan Criminal Code 205.  If the court grants the request, the prosecutor can hold the defendant up to 10 days.  Crim. Proc. 208.  However, this can be extended a further 10 days with judicial approval.  Crim. Proc. 208.2  Although the judiciary is formally involved, in practice judges are extraordianarily deferential: Satoru Shinomiya reports that "Between 1987 and 1996, 99.5%- 99.7% of all detention warrants and extensions were granted by judges," Adversarial Procedure without a Jury: Is Japan's System Adversarial, Inquisitorial, or Something Else?, The Japanese Adversary System in Context, note 40, at 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Given the difference between this interrogation system and the system in the U.S., the U.S. has argued that the [[extraterritoriality]] granted its military members under the SOFA is necessary to afford them the same rights that exist under the U.S. criminal justice system.  However, since the [[1995 Okinawan rape incident]], the U.S. has agreed to favorably consider handing over suspects in serious cases such as rape and murder before they have been charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau''' are an [[indigenous people of Brazil]],&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;[http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/urueu-wau-wau/ ''Last Days of Eden: Rondônia's Urueu-Wau-Wau Indians''] Loren McIntyre, National Geographic (December 1988), pp. 800-817 (retrieved 10 Aug 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; living in the state of [[Rondônia]].

They live in six villages on the borders of [[Terra Indigena Uru-Eu-Uaw-Uaw]], which is shared by three sub-groups, the Amondawa, Jupaú, and Uru Pa In, as well as the [[Jurureí]], Parakua, and two [[uncontacted tribes]] whose names are not known.&lt;ref name=demo&gt;[http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/uru-eu-wau-wau/1125 "Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau: Identification and Demography."] ''Povos Indígenas no Brasil.'' (retrieved 26 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
They are also known as the Amondauas, Bocas-negras, Bocas-pretas, Cabeça-vermelha, Cautários, Sotérios, Urupain,&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; as well as Jupaú, Black-Mouths, Red-Heads, Urueu-Wau-Wau.&lt;ref name=world&gt;[http://www.minorityrights.org/5310/brazil/urueuwauwau.html "Urueu-Wau-Wau."] ''World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples.'' (retrieved 22 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Uru-Eu-Uaw-Uaw came into contact with non-Natives, specifically the [[National Indian Foundation]] ([[FUNAI]]) in 1981,&lt;ref name=world/&gt; which was followed by a loss of population. In 1981, there were 250 Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau people, but only 89 in 1993. Diseases and violent attacks by outsiders have killed them. Rubber harvesters fought FUNAI's outlines of Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau lands. In 1991, one of the  world's largest known tin deposits was discovered in Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau lands.&lt;ref name=world/&gt;

After 1993 their population began increasing again.&lt;ref name=demo/&gt; The [[Terra Indigena Uru-Eu-Uaw-Uaw]] was established by the [[Brazil]]ian government to protect the tribes and only Indians can legally live in the [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territory]]; however, loggers and miners have regularly invaded their lands.&lt;ref name=survive&gt;[http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/2156 "Massive Invasion of Isolated Indians' Land."] ''Survival International.'' 12 Jan 2007 (retrieved 26 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Missionaries are active among the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, and an NGO called Kanindé is trying to fight outside influences and assimilationists on the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau.&lt;ref name=world/&gt;

==Language==
The Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau speak the [[Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau language]], a [[Tupi–Guarani language]], Subgroup IV.&lt;ref name=world/&gt; The language is also known as Uru-Eu-Uau-Uau, Eru-Eu-Wau-Wau, Ureuwawau, or Kagwahiva, and its [[ISO 639-3]] language code is "urz".&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;

==Culture==
The Uru-Eu-Uaw-Uaw are [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They use a poison made from tree bark on their arrows when hunting [[tapir]] and other game. They are known for their distinctive tattoos around their mouths made from ''genipapo'', a black [[vegetal dye]].&lt;ref name=survive/&gt;

An additional 3.6% identify as Black/African-descendants, while 3.2% identify as Amerindians.&lt;ref name="Census-ethnics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ine.gob.ve/documentos/Demografia/CensodePoblacionyVivienda/pdf/nacional.pdf |title=Resultado Básico del XIV Censo Nacional de Población y Vivienda 2011 (Mayo 2014) |page=29 |publisher=Ine.gov.ve |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and ethnic aspects==

===Pre-Columbian period===

Pre-Columbian times, is a historical stage where various immigrant groups begin to move the current Americas, at which writing was not used, thus being difficult to find evidence of the people who began to populate this land. However, archaeological excavations are the evidences that establish certain periods that were taking place on the continent.

In the case of Venezuela, probably the man first appeared 16,000 years ago, this due to migration flows from other indigenous cultures of America, from the south to the Amazon, from the west through Los Andes and north by the Caribbean Sea.

There are four periods of diversity that develop in the current Venezuela, which also entering a new period, it did not mean the end of the previous.

The first migrations to the continent were probably from East Asia to 15,000 years. C. These early migrants (called forth by the generic name "Indians") came at first to be located in North America, later moving to the territory of present Venezuela. Now for their offspring, it was clear verify the Asian features on their faces that will adapt to the climate and lifestyle.

During this period, various mammals were disappearing by climatic changes already beginning to take place from 5000 years ago, so the population in the mainland, starts to move towards the coast and spread to some nearby islands, trying to find new feeding alternatives.

===Colonization===
On August 2, 1498 (516 years), [[Christopher Columbus]], and the Spanish colonizers ships, landed for the first time in American mainland and did so in the current Venezuelan territory. With the rapid colonization process despite small local indigenous rebellions, the Spaniards manage to conquer the territory, beginning during this period the most significant crossbreeding process that will define later the social profile of the country.

With the passage of time, and the introduction of the African continent, a third race, the Africans, started to integrate into the population, creating heterogeneity in the faces of the society of the time.

During colonial centuries in Venezuela began to settle the "peninsular whites", coming directly from the Iberian Peninsula and which were those who held positions in the crown, representing only 15% of the population. Another group of whites who were born in Venezuela were originally called "Creole", representing 20% of the population: they were mostly from the Canary Islands and they worked mainly in petty trade. The other two smaller groups were the original inhabitants and indigenous blacks brought from Africa: they were about 5% of the population. Soon the original groups started to have interbreedings and this created a process of "fusion" between the different racial groups: The "brown" were descendants of the unions between Whites, Indians and Blacks and by the 18th century were the largest racial and social group being more than 60% of the population.

This process is currently responsible for the majority of Venezuelans who are of mixed race.

===Current ethnic groups===

The country has a diverse population that reflects its rich history and the people that have lived here since antiquity to the present. The historic amalgam of different principal groups form the basis of the current demographics of Venezuela: the European immigrants, the Amerindian peoples, African, [[Asian people|Asian]], Middle Eastern and other recent immigrants.

Many of the indigenous peoples were absorbed by the mixed population, but the remaining 500,000 currently represent more than 85 different cultures.

European immigrants were mainly Spanish colonists, but another large and growing number are descendants of Europeans ([[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italo-Venezuelans|Italians]], [[Germans]] and [[Americans]]) who migrated to the region in mid-twentieth century during the oil growth in the country. Small numbers are descendants of  [[French people|French]], [[English people|English]] and [[Poles|Polish]], as they emigrated during World War II and the Cold War.

Black Africans were brought as slaves, mostly coastal lowlands, beginning early in the sixteenth century and continuing into the nineteenth century. Other immigrant populations are Asian and Middle East, particularly Lebanon, Syria and the Arab world, some Jews from southern Spain, Israel and Central European nations, East Asians like Chinese and Japanese, Dominicans, Haitians, Cubans, Peruvians, Argentinians, Uruguayans, Chileans, Ecuadorians and Colombians, this being the greatest social impact due to a large number of displaced individuals who entered the Venezuelan territory during the armed conflict in that country; which generated a high supply of labor, personnel and domestic economy informal.

===Ethnic-somatic characteristics===

[[File:Boys_in_the_river_of_Venezuela_2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Boys from [[Margarita Island]], [[Nueva Esparta]].]]
Currently, according to the critic D'Ambrosio and other academics,&lt;ref&gt;D'Ambrosio, B. ''L'emigrazione italiana nel Venezuela''. Edizioni "Universitá degli Studi di Genova". Genova, 1981 [http://researchomnia.blogspot.com/2012_02_01_archive.html Aspectos etnico-somaticos de la poblacion venezolana en 1981 (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt; about 51.6% of Venezuelans are mestizos (called ''Criollos'': the 40% of them are with mostly white features, 20% with mostly black features and 10% with mostly Indians features), 45% are white, 2% are black and 1% Indians.

Notably, according to these scholars, is the fact that virtually there are no pure blacks in Venezuela, including those with the darkest skin, found especially in the area of Barlovento. Most of which being limited to black Venezuelans who descend from recent immigrants. Virtually the same is also said for both white Venezuelans and indigenous Venezuelans.

In addition, according to a genetic autosomal DNA study conducted in 2008 by the University of Brasilia (UNB), the composition of the population of Venezuela is: 60.60% European, 23% of Native American contribution and 16% of Africa's contribution.&lt;ref name="Godinho 2008"/&gt;

==Demography==
{{Main|Demographics of Venezuela}}
[[Image:Venezuelan diaspora around the world.png|300px|right|thumb|Venezuelans in the world]]
The population of approximately 28 million people (in 2011) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gob.ve/documentos/Demografia/CensodePoblacionyVivienda/pdf/ResultadosBasicosCenso2011.pdf|title=Ine.gob.ve|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
made Venezuela the sixth-most populous country in [[Latin America]] (after [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Argentina]] and [[Peru]]). Approximately more than one million (4-6% of the total population) are living in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altag.net/casi-6-de-la-poblacion-venezolana-vive-en-el-exterior/|title=Altag.net|publisher=|access-date=2016-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002232156/http://www.altag.net/casi-6-de-la-poblacion-venezolana-vive-en-el-exterior/|archive-date=2014-10-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than ninety percent of the Venezuelans live in urban areas – a figure significantly higher than the world average. The literacy rate (98 percent) in Venezuela is also well above the world average, and the rate of population growth slightly exceeds the world average. A large proportion of Venezuelans are young, largely because of recent decreases in the infant mortality rate. While 30 percent of the people are 14 years old or younger, just 4 percent are aged 65 or older.

==Ethnic groups==
[[File:Birthday of Venezuelan Family 1961.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Family in 1961.]]
[[File:Children_performing_artistic_dance_-_Danza_artística_ejecutada_por_niños.JPG|thumb|200px|Venezuelan girls dancing.]]
The country has a diverse population that reflects its colorful history and the peoples that have resided there throughout. The historic amalgam of the different main groups forms the basics of Venezuela's current demographics: [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian peoples]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]], [[Asian people|Asians]], [[Arab diaspora|Middle Easterners]] and other recent immigrants.The autosomal DNA genetic composition of  population in Venezuela, is 60.60% of European contribution, 23% of indigenous contribution, and 16.30% of African contribution.&lt;ref name="Godinho 2008"/&gt;

===Mestizos===
{{main|Mestizo Venezuelan}}

Many of the indigenous peoples were absorbed into the [[Mestizos in Venezuela|Mestizo]] population, because of the heavy mixture of European and African people. They represent over half of the country's population (about 51.6%).&lt;ref name="Census-ethnics" /&gt;

===White and European Venezuelans===

[[File:Venezuelan people of Scandinavian ancestry.png|200px|thumb|Venezuelan children's of [[Scandinavia]]n ancestry.]]
{{main|European Venezuelan|History of the Jews in Venezuela}}
The European immigrants were mostly [[Spanish people|Spanish]] colonists, but a high number of other Europeans brought by the past high growth  from [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italian Venezuelan|Italian]], and [[German Venezuelan|German]] immigrants to the region in the middle 20th century by the [[History of the Venezuelan oil industry|Petroleum Growth]], and in much smaller numbers [[French people|French]], [[English people|English]], [[Polish Venezuelan|Polish]], [[Russian Venezuelan|Russian]], [[Greek Venezuelan|Greek]], [[Scandinavian Venezuelan|Scandinavian]], [[Romanian Venezuelan|Romanian]], [[Ukrainian Venezuelan|Ukrainian]] and [[Hungarian Venezuelan|Hungarian]] communities immigrated during the Second World War and the [[Cold War]]. 300,000 Italians and an equal numbers of Spaniards immigrated in the 1940s and 1950s, and earlier who were fleeing from the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1930s).

They are concentrated though almost half of Venezuela's land area that lies north of the [[Orinoco]] (where the 95% vast majority of Venezuelans live), principally in important urban areas like [[Greater Caracas]], [[Maracaibo]], [[Maracay]], [[Valencia, Venezuela|Valencia]], [[Diego Bautista Urbaneja Municipality|Lecheria]], [[Barquisimeto]]/[[Cabudare]], [[Colonia Tovar]], [[Punto Fijo]]; the [[Andean Region (Venezuela)|Andean States]], [[Margarita Island]] and [[Araya Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=95&amp;Itemid=26|title=Censos de población y vivienda|website=www.ine.gob.ve}}&lt;/ref&gt; They represent almost half of the population (43.6%).&lt;ref name="Census-ethnics" /&gt;

===Black and African Venezuelans===
[[File:NercelySotoHeat200mWomenGORio2016.jpg|thumb|110px|[[Nercely Soto]], afro-Venezuelan athlete.]]
{{main|Afro-Venezuelan}}
[[Black people|Black Africans]] were brought as [[slave]]s, mostly to the coastal lowlands, beginning early in the 16th century, and continuing into the mid 19th century. 
Although they are located in almost the entire country, the Black and African population are concentrated in places where they used to be slaves and worked as farm hands on subsistence farms of [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[tobacco]], [[sugar cane]] and [[cotton]] in the [[w:es:Municipio Veroes|Aroa Valley]], [[Litoral varguense]], [[Falcón|Eastern Falcon state]];  [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], [[Bobures]] and [[Palmarito]] in  the [[Sur del Lago]] Region; and in areas where slaves would run away during [[Colonial Venezuela]]  and formed cumbes, communities in mountainous and isolated areas, such as, the [[Sierra de Falcón]], [[Barlovento, Venezuela|Barlovento Region]] ([[Acevedo, Venezuela|Acevedo]], [[Andrés Bello, Miranda|Andrés Bello]], [[Brión, Venezuela|Brión]], [[Buroz]] and [[Páez, Miranda|Páez]] municipalities), [[Ocumare de La Costa]], [[Choroní]]; [[El Callao Municipality|El Callao]] and [[Paria Peninsula]] (where [[Afro-Trinidadian]] also migrated); and through [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Los Llanos]], well dispersed in small to decent percents. They represent 3.6% of the population.&lt;ref name="Census-ethnics" /&gt;

===Indigenous peoples===
[[File:Homelessness in Venezuela.jpg|thumb|200px|Venezuelan [[Wayuu people|Wayuu]] family in [[Zulia]].]] 
{{main|Indigenous peoples in Venezuela}}

Before the Spanish colonization of the region that would become the country of Venezuela, the territory was the home to many different [[indigenous peoples]]. Today more than fifty different indigenous ethnic groups inhabit Venezuela. Most of them speak languages belonging to the  [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]], [[Cariban languages|Carib]]an, and [[Chibchan languages|Chibcha]]n languages families. Pure indigenous Amerindians comprise around 2 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intute&amp;nbsp; – World Guide&amp;nbsp; – Venezuela |url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/worldguide/html/856_people.html |accessdate=2007-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083706/http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/worldguide/html/856_people.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 101 languages listed for Venezuela in the Ethnologue database, of which 80 are spoken today as living languages. Today, they're mostly located south of the [[Orinoco]], in the [[Guayana Region, Venezuela|Guayana Region]], an area that covers half of the country but the population represents just around 2% of Venezuelans; other important regions where they're located are on [[Zulia]] state, [[Apure]] state, the [[Eastern Region, Venezuela|Eastern Region]] and [[Orinoco Delta]].

===Arab and Middle Easterner Venezuelans===
{{main|Arab Venezuelan|Lebanese Venezuelan}}
Arab immigration to Venezuela started as early as the 19th and 20th centuries. They came mostly from [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. They are mostly located in the most important urban areas and [[Margarita Island]], representing around 5% of the population in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/15/abdel-el-zabayar-from-parliament-to-the-frontlines|title=Abdel el-Zabayar: From Parliament to the Frontlines|first=Mac|last=Margolis|date=15 September 2013|website=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asian Venezuelans===
{{main|Chinese Venezuelan|Japanese Venezuelan|Korean Venezuelan|Indian Venezuelan}}
The largest sub-groups are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from Mainland China, India, Japan and Korea. The first wave of immigrants began in 1847 and consisted of mainly Cantonese immigrants; then the second wave during beginning of the 1940s and 1950s, consisted of Chinese and Japanese immigrants;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.ve/books?id=8P2SAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=Population+of+Japanese+in+Venezuela&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=teM0ryZBta&amp;sig=nIZ-u8XPJOgt155ZR26-hIG9YrM&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwATgKahUKEwiRxMijxfrHAhWBzYAKHfOWDgE#v=onepage&amp;q=Venezuela&amp;f=false|title=Japanese Diasporas: Unsung Pasts, Conflicting Presents and Uncertain Futures|first=Nobuko|last=Adachi|date=3 October 2006|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching a peak in the mid-1970s in connection with the [[History of the Venezuelan oil industry#1940.E2.80.931976.E2.80.94The road to nationalization|oil boom]], where Korean&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Byung-Keun|last=Lim|title=Photos Show Daily Lives of S.

The name was chosen to refer to a [[Viridian|shade of green]] that does not quite look natural, indicating that the movement was about innovative design and technology, in contrast with the "leaf green" of traditional environmentalism.

[[File:HypothermiaAge.jpg|thumb|alt=Hypothermia risk factor as a function of age.|Risk factors include age, medical conditions, and homeless status.''  [[Hypothermia]]''.]]

A '''warming center''' is a short-term [[emergency shelter]] that operates when temperatures or a combination of precipitation, wind chill, wind and temperature become dangerously inclement. Their paramount purpose is the prevention of death and injury from exposure to the elements. This may include acute trauma from falling objects such as trees, or injury to extremities due to [[frostbite]]. A more prevalent emergency which warming centers seek to prevent is [[hypothermia]], the risk for which is aggravated by factors such as age, alcohol consumption, and homelessness.

== Purpose ==

Thus warming centers are frequently directed to the circumstances of persons who are "unsheltered" due to a personal state of [[homelessness]] and who, for one reason or another, do not utilize existing [[homeless shelters]]. In other circumstances, centers serve stranded motorists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richmond, Randy and John Miner, The London Free Press |url=https://lfpress.com/news/london/2010/12/14/16551251.html |title=A warming centre refuge |work=London Free Press |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, during cold-weather power outages, [[homeowners]] and [[tenants]].

In some cases, when cold snaps threaten wildlife, they are created and operated to protect endangered wild animals. Cold blooded animals such as turtles are particularly vulnerable as are their hatchlings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reef2reef.com/forums/general-reef-discussions/52483-freezing-temps-convert-ora-into-sea.html |title=Freezing Temps Convert ORA into Sea Turtle Warming Center Again |publisher=Reef2reef.com |date=December 24, 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency shelters vary in policy on pets, companions, or domesticated animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvoa.com/news/three-shelters-warming-center-to-open-their-doors-today/ |title=Three shelters, "warming center" to open their doors today &amp;#124; KVOA.com &amp;#124; Tucson, Arizona |publisher=KVOA.com |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[service animals]] may be admitted even when other animals are prohibited.&lt;ref name=AAC-OEM /&gt; During large scale disasters, there are frequently separate locations including a safe place for horses. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Location of warming centers==
[[File:Warming_center.jpg|thumb|alt=Churches are frequently used for warming centers.''  [[Hypothermia]]''.]]
===Existing shelters===

While they are in some cases directly affiliated with existing [[homeless shelter]] operations, warming centers are more frequently housed in different locations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  Due to [[zoning]], [[special use permit]], and [[fire code]] restrictions, homeless shelters and day centers serving homeless populations are often legally constrained from exceeding authorized capacity.  Not infrequently, existing shelters are engaged with ongoing negotiations with neighbors who in some cases take a [[NIMBY]] (''not in my backyard'') attitude toward existing operations. Any increase in capacity can become politicized, despite the exigencies of spikes in cold temperature days, particularly when cold or rainy weather is routine.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Thus, they need to secure alternative sites unless restrictions are waived due to extreme or otherwise unusual weather. Such waivers may be either on a one-time basis, or pursuant to [[memorandum of understanding]] (MOU's) with relevant agencies; however, existing shelter sites are typically at the highest level of use compatible with neighborhood character and the political balance of power.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Few warming center sites appear to be utilizing the same building as routine homeless shelter operations, and the preponderance of them do situate in alternative sites.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Alternative sites===

When not using existing shelters under MOU's or other legal instruments relaxing ordinary legal restrictions, venues of operation frequently involve coalitions of non-profit entities which own or operate suitable real estate. These include churches and community organizations but also may involve special purpose institutional real estate such as national guard armories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warming center now open at National Guard Armory in Gilroy|url=http://www.gilroydispatch.com/news/270757-warming-center-now-open-at-national-guard-armory-in-gilroy|publisher=Gilroy Dispatch|accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some municipalities designate existing public facilities as warming centers during extreme cold weather. Examples include [[senior centers]], [[public libraries]], and [[police stations]].&lt;ref name=AAC-OEM&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://mail.rcn.com/service/home/~/AACO%20Warming%20Centers.pdf?auth=co&amp;loc=en_US&amp;id=394522&amp;part=2 | title = Excessive Cold Prompts Opening of Warming Centers | date = December 13, 2016 | publisher = Anne Arundel County Office of Emergency Management | format = pdf | access-date = December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Determination to activate warming centers===
Warming centers are generally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lompocrecord.com/news/local/article_439f91de-f79c-11df-ad71-001cc4c03286.html |title=Warming center opens at homeless shelter |publisher=Lompocrecord.com |date=November 23, 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened for only a few days at a time based on the conditions of the area, although some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.multco.us/sites/default/files/dchs-community-services/documents/winshltmanaual_2010-2011_4.pdf |title=Multnomah County Homeless Families Emergency Services |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; are open for specific portion of the year when weather conditions are adverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windsor Locks Open Warming Center During Power Outage|url=http://www.wfsb.com/news/26187742/detail.html|publisher=WFSB|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sierravista-fthuachuca.kold.com/content/warming-center-open-apache-middle-school |title="Warming Center" Open at Apache Middle School &amp;|work=Sierra Vista-Ft. Huachuca News |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Chicago opens its shelters from December 1 to March 1 each year, as well as any other times the temperature drops below freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/fss/provdrs/emerg/svcs/dfss_warming_centers.html | title=DFSS Warming Centers | work=City of Chicago | accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Portland, Oregon]], uses a more complex formula to determine when to open shelters; factors include wet or dry conditions, the night's predicted low, the three-day trend of lows, sustained wind speed, and whether snow is on the ground or predicted to fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oregonredcross.org/general.asp?SN=2866&amp;OP=2872&amp;SUOP=4473&amp;IDCapitulo=663b0id44v | title=Disaster Responders—Emergency Warming Center Volunteers | work=Oregon Red Cross | accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activation is generally a centralized decision based upon what is termed either an [[algorithm]], or, in other jurisdictions, an Activation Trigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonredcross.org/detalle_noticias.asp?SN=200&amp;OP=2855&amp;id=6896&amp;IDCapitulo=663B0ID44V |title=Emergency Warming Center 2011-12 |publisher=Oregon Red Cross |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane County, Oregon utilizes an elaborate system of tiered readiness levels in collaboration with the American Red Cross.&lt;ref name="ARC"&gt;{{cite web|last=McCowan |first=Karen |url=http://eganwarmingcenter.com/home.html |title=Home Page |publisher=Egan Warming Center |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They refer to these levels as their "alert status", ranging from fair weather OUTLOOK status to STANDBY,WATCH and finally ACTIVATE.&lt;ref name=ARC /&gt;

==Operations==
=== Outreach to vulnerable persons ===

Once a center has been sited, staffed and the volunteer [[phone tree]] has been activated, it is required to connect with the populations it intends to reach and persuade them to come in. A significant population is resistant to interaction with perceived "authorities" and others may not have sufficient contact with the system of care to be adequately aware of their options. A recent trend promoted by organizations such as [[Common Ground (New York City)|Common Ground]] is to piggy back [[vulnerability indexes]] and site data onto HUD-mandated [[enumeration studies]]. One of the benefits hoped for with regard to those projects is that there will be better opportunities to promote the warming center option to vulnerable populations.

Centers often coordinate with outside programs. For communication of the availability of open centers, many coordinate with the Federally mandated [[2-1-1]] or the [[3-1-1]] phone information system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington County Severe Weather/Warming Center Information |publisher=211|accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Street newspapers]] are generally published weekly or less frequently, which makes them useful only for general information such as contact numbers and locations.

For transportation to centers, some offer free transportation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fresno.gov/Government/DepartmentDirectory/ParksandRecreation/CommunityServices/FreezeRelief.htm |title=Warming Center |publisher=Fresno.gov |date=January 22, 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in some cases for persons being released from jail into conditions of inclement weather.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Lynn Jahnke, Public Testimony, South Coast Homeless Advisory Committee, Minutes, February 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
In blizzard conditions, snowmobile enthusiasts have been mobilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mywebtimes.com/archives/ottawa/display.php?id=423602&amp;query=homeless&amp;comment_sub=done&amp;comment=1#comments |title=County declared a disaster area |work=My Web Times |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warming centers in service ===

Once opened and populated, they typically offer only the most bare-bones of service: a cot and perhaps a bowl of hot soup. They are generally operated with one or more experienced professional staff person, due to the difficulties which untrained volunteers might encounter in dealing with the clientele. Often, users of warming centers are persons who are not participating in routine [[homeless shelter]] services due to disciplinary exclusions or non-compliance with behavioral policies. In order to distinguish mere oddness from behavioral disorders which might disrupt the ability of other persons to obtain service, professional staff is the preferred alternative to all -volunteer personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jahnke|first=Dr. Lynn|title=Public Comment on Agenda Item: Request From Mayor Schneider And Councilmember House Regarding A Funding Request From Freedom Warming Centers, Santa Barbara City Council|url= http://www.santabarbaraca.gov/CAP/MG92472/AS92476/AS92491/AS92496/AI95770/DO95771/DO_95771.pdf|publisher=City of Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others utilizing Warming Centers are persons who are not in the shelter system for an array of reasons not necessarily associated with pathology. They may personally be in transit but not prepared financially or otherwise to contend with unanticipated weather conditions. Others may be locals who are eligible for but decline to stay in shelters due to objections to policies and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://santabarbara.legistar.com/DepartmentDetail.aspx?ID=7125&amp;GUID=59BAB55F-72A3-4AC9-B4EC-7070FEC423AE&amp;Mode=MainBody |title=Report to Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors, Steven Levios Memorial Homeless Opinion Survey |publisher=County of Santa Barbara |date= November 1 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic and current role in society==
Warming centers frequently are opened as a response to the occurrence of hospitalizations dues to [[hypothermia]] when unsheltered persons are discovered in extreme [[Exposure (environmental hazard)|exposure]]-related [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] or mortality.

They seem to go back as far as 1945, when used in Berlin at the conclusion of [[World War II]]. Clothing and blankets were allowed for under the air lift plans and an extensive plan was developed for public "warming centers."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin (Territory under Allied Occupation, 1945– U.S. Sector), Germany (Territory under Allied Occupation, 1945–1955 : U.S. Zone)&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, U.S. warming centers are proliferating as a means to serve the unsheltered homeless during temperature and rainfall spikes. Such [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s may not have access to year-round [[homeless shelters]] due to supply and demand imbalance, or may simply be uninterested in nightly access during mild weather, but some observers note that others may be unable to comply with conditions for use. According to Detroit socialist writer Naomi Spencer, they serve also as  "a last resort for homeless people to find respite from the cold, especially those with drug addictions, mental illness, or criminal backgrounds, who may not meet requirements imposed by some homeless shelters or religious charity operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/jan2011/home-j29.shtml |title=Detroit cuts funding for homeless warming centers |publisher=Wsws.org |date=January 29, 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others, including [[straight edge]], [[DIY]], or anarchist-identified persons who may  choose to live "off-the-grid", without facing exclusion from quotidian shelters due to sobriety issues.&lt;ref name="national geographic special"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Inside Straight Edge |episodelink= |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/inside/3442/Overview#tab-Videos/05229_00 |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |series=Inside |serieslink= |credits=Writer: David Shadrack Smith.

Others simply find shelters too regimented, too much like jail: newspaperman Mike Hendricks quotes a former resident of an unauthorized homeless encampment named Crow, who said that "some guys would sooner do what they want and not be told what to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hendricks|first=Mike|title=After judge’s warning, homeless camp with TV, Christmas lights is taken apart|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2011/01/18/2593523/after-judges-warning-homeless.html#|publisher=The Kansas City Star|accessdate=February 14, 2011|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Brown (naturalist)|Tom Brown's]] Field Guide to City and Suburban Survival contains chapters on shelters and heating.&lt;ref name="Field Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Tom|title=Tom Brown's Field Guide to City and Suburban Survival|year=1986|publisher=Berkley Trade|location=New York|isbn=0-425-09172-4}} {{Page needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also outlines means of creating a personal warming center by using ATM access cards.&lt;ref name="Field Guide"/&gt; His recommendations have been circulated by Chicago's urban community activist Chrisdian Wittenburg including instructions on building a makeshift stove and a plethora of collaborative cultural projects.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Controversy ==

Perception of the importance and priority of warming centers varies. At one extreme, their under-utilization or minimal level of service is characterized as unfriendly. During the blizzard of February 2011, the City of Ottawa, Illinois did not have established warming centers, and an ''ad hoc'' facility was established. Users were required to bring their own food and blankets, drawing fire for the "have-nots...can all freeze to death...here in the friendly city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cities offer warming centers|url=http://mywebtimes.com/archives/ottawa/display.php?id=423449|publisher=The Times Company|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Detroit, failure to disburse [[Community Development Block Grant]]s resulted in a situation where people slept in plastic chairs or "in cold hallways".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Naomi|title=Detroit cuts funding for homeless warming centers|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/jan2011/home-j29.shtml|publisher=World Socialist Web Site|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the other end of the continuum, critics have expressed skepticism that the churches and other facilities utilized for warming centers are appropriate and capable of handling the clientele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Francisco|first=Dale|title=Comment on Agenda Item: Request From Mayor Schneider And Councilmember House Regarding A Funding Request From Freedom Warming Centers, Santa Barbara City Council|url= http://www.santabarbaraca.gov/CAP/MG92472/AS92476/AS92491/AS92496/AI95770/DO95771/DO_95771.pdf|publisher=City of Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another contention is that assisting homeless people "enables" them to continue a lifestyle which is problematic.

But advocates of warming centers have similarly noted that they tend to maintain the status quo by not addressing structural factors, but their emphasis is that too little rather than too much is done to help the needy. Sue Murphy is the administrative director of Interfaith Action of Evanston, Illinois, which has a daytime center for a time slot during which overnight shelters are closed to clients. She states that warmth and snacks "is not nearly enough...what we need is a place where they can go the whole winter. Her concerns are seconded by Sue Loellebach of Connections for the Homeless, who laments the paucity of warm refuge during daylight hours, but rejects that and even extended-stay shelters as inadequate and that they perpetuate the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Svitek|first=Patrick|title=Evanston homeless find warm shelters|url=http://www.dailynorthwestern.com/city/evanston-homeless-find-warm-shelters-1.2458986|publisher=Daily Northwestern|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">'''Whitney Rogers Cross''' (1913–1955), a mid-20th-century historian, is still well known in certain American academic circles as the author of ''The Burned-over District: The Social and Intellectual History of Enthusiastic Religion in Western New York, 1800 – 1850''  (Cornell University Press, 1950).

== Biography ==

Cross was born in [[Rochester, New York]] in 1913.  After completing an M.A. in History at the [[University of Rochester]], he taught high school in [[Painted Post, New York]] from 1936 to 1939, when he left to enter a graduate program at [[Harvard University]].  Cross’s teachers at Harvard included [[Perry Miller]], widely considered to be one of the inventors of the sub-discipline now commonly referred to as [[intellectual history]]; Frederick Merk, a social historian influenced by the “frontier hypothesis” of [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]; and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr., whose pioneering work in both [[social history]] and women’s history shaped a generation of scholars.  While working on his dissertation with Schlesinger, Cross served as the first head of the Local and Regional History Collection at [[Cornell University]].  After completing his degree in 1945, he held teaching positions at [[Connecticut College]] for Women, at [[Smith College]], and at [[West Virginia University]].  He died in 1955.

== ''The Burned-over District'' ==

''The Burned-over District'' asserts that during the first half of the nineteenth century, the inhabitants of the western third of [[New York (state)|New York State]] showed themselves to be atypically willing to give themselves over to various “isms,” including [[revivalism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Millerites|Millerism]], [[spiritualism]], AntiMasonic agitation, [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], [[feminism]], and experiments in [[Intentional community|communal living]].   Whether this area was in fact unusually hospitable to revivalism and social reform movements is now considered to be open to question, but this is beside the point.  It was Cross’s methodology and the contours of his argument that struck his readers as innovative and worthy of imitation.   Basically, Cross used materials commonly associated with local or regional history—demographic data, commercial records, and eyewitness accounts from relatively obscure individuals—to argue that the social environment constructed in this area at this time made the inhabitants more willing and more likely than most Americans of this era to pursue both their own improvement and the improvement of society as a whole.   The book was reprinted in paperback as recently as 2006.

The status of '''women in Argentina''' has changed significantly following the return of democracy in 1983; and they  have attained a relatively high level of equality. In the [[Global Gender Gap Report]] prepared by the [[World Economic Forum]] in 2009, Argentine women ranked 24th among 134 countries studied in terms of their access to resources and opportunities relative to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.cl/mujeres-siguen-siendo-discriminadas/noticias/2009-10-27/203100.html|title=''La Nación'': Mujeres siguen siendo discriminadas|language=Spanish|website=Lanacion.cl|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They enjoy comparable levels of [[Education in Argentina|education]], and somewhat higher [[Gross enrollment ratio|school enrollment ratios]] than their male counterparts.

Their economic clout in relation to men is higher than in most Latin American countries, however,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieco.clarin.com/economia/Brecha-mujer-gana_0_82500032.html|title=''iEco'': Brecha salarial|language=Spanish|website=Ieco.clarin.com|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous Argentine women hold top posts in the Argentine corporate world;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieco.clarin.com/empresas/mujeres-manejan-millones_0_107700028.html|title=''iEco'': Las mujeres que manejan los millones |language=Spanish|website=Ieco.clarin.com|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; among the best known are [[Cris Morena]], owner of the television production company by the same name, [[María Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat]], former CEO and majority stakeholder of [[Loma Negra]], the nation's largest cement manufacturer, and [[Ernestina Herrera de Noble]], director of [[Grupo Clarín]], the premier media group in Argentina.

Argentine women, however, continue to face numerous systemic challenges common to those in other nations. [[Domestic violence in Argentina]] is a serious problem, as are obstacles to the timely prosecution of [[rape]], the prevalence of [[sexual harassment]], and a persistent [[gender pay gap]], among other iniquities.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016|website=State.gov|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
===Nineteenth Century===
[[File:Juana Azurduy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Juana Azurduy de Padilla]], led independence fighters in the Rio de la Plata region]]
In the early nineteenth century, the Spanish crown ruled the region now encompassed by the modern countries of Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, via the [[viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata]], with the capital in [[Buenos Aires]].  With the Napoleonic invasion of Spain in 1808, areas of the viceroyalty rose in revolt.  
[[File:RaptodeDoñarinidadSalcedo.jpg|thumb|left|Abduction of a white Argentine woman, Doña Trinidad Salcedo by [[Araucanians]] painted by [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]]]]
One of the participants in the wars for independence was [[Juana Azurduy]], who is honored now by both Bolivia and Argentina as contributing to independence.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Juana Azurduy]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Argentine President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] promoted Azurduy to the rank of general in the Argentine army from lieutenant colonel. The Argentine army named an infantry regiment based in the northern region of Salta as "Generala Juana Azurduy." In June 2014, President Fernández de Kirchner unveiled the new Argentine 10-peso note with the image of Azurduy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1703106-cristina-presento-el-nuevo-billete-de-10-pesos-con-manuel-belgrano-y-juana-azurduy|title=Cristina presentó el nuevo billete de 10 pesos con Manuel Belgrano y Juana Azurduy|website=Lanacion.com|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentina in the early nineteenth century had few cities, but the port of Buenos Aires grew from a backwater of the Spanish empire into a major port in the late eighteenth century.  Rural areas in Argentina were sparsely populated by the indigenous [[Mapuche]] and [[gaucho]]s, mixed race men on horseback who hunted free-range cattle for their hides and to make dried beef.  Non-indigenous women on the vast Argentine pampas were few, and depicted in art as vulnerable to abduction by "barbarian" Indians.

===Twentieth Century===
[[File:Evita color.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|[[Eva Perón]], 1947]]
[[Image:Madres pza de mayo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] with President Néstor Kirchner]]
During the 1930s, [[Fanny Edelman]], a Communist leader who was part of the [[International Brigades]] in defense of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], became an international figure representing Communism and Feminism. She participated to the creation of the Women's Union of Argentina in 1937, and in 1972 she became head of the [[Women's International Democratic Federation]]. She was honorary president of the Communist party of Argentina until her death in 2011.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title = A los 100 años murió Fanny Edelman|language = Spanish|publisher =Página/12|date = 2011-11-01|url = http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/ultimas/20-180265-2011-11-01.html|accessdate = 2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent iconic"&gt;{{cite news | title = Iconic Communist Leader Dies at the Age of 100 | language = Spanish | publisher = The Argentina Independent | date = 2011-11-03 | url = http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/latest-news/newsfromargentina/iconic-communist-leader-dies-at-the-age-of-100/ | accessdate = 2016-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following President [[Juan Perón]]'s enactment of [[women's suffrage]] in 1949, First Lady [[Evita Perón]] led the [[Female Peronist Party|Peronist Women's Party]] until her death in 1952, and helped enhance the role of women in [[Argentine society]]. Women played a significant role as both supporters and opponents of the [[National Reorganization Process]], Argentina's last dictatorship, in the late 1970s, and the establishment of the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]], an advocacy group led by mothers of the [[desaparecidos|disappeared]], was done by [[Azucena Villaflor|Azucena Villaflor de Vicenti]] and, mostly, other women, on the rationale that they would be less likely to be the targets of repression (Villaflor de Vicenti and her fellow founders were murdered by the regime in 1977).&lt;ref&gt;Fleitlowitz, Marguerite. ''A Lexicon of Terror: Argentina and the Legacies of Torture''. Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Women's rights in Argentina progressed in significant ways following the return of democracy in 1983. President [[Raúl Alfonsín]] signed laws in 1987 both limiting ''[[Patria potestas]]'' (the latitude given to a father regarding his treatment of fellow household members, particularly children) and legalizing [[divorce]], helping resolve the legal status of 3 million adults living in [[legal separation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/A-Bo/Argentina.html|title=Culture of Argentina - history, people, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social|website=Everyculture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Argentine quota law]] signed by President [[Carlos Menem]] in 1991 provides that one-third of the members of both houses of congress must be women, a goal achieved through balanced election slates.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78877.htm Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Argentina]. [[United States]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (March 6, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, there were 29 women in the 72-seat Senate, 86 women in the 257-seat [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]], two female Supreme Court justices, and three women in the presidential cabinet.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The President of Argentina, [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] was elected in 2007; the runner-up in the crowded field was also a woman, [[Elisa Carrió]].

==Family life==
{{Women in society sidebar}}
With regard to the organization of [[family]] life, Argentina has a history of [[social conservatism]], and the influence of [[Catholicism in Argentina]] has been very strong throughout the 20th century. In Argentina, [[divorce]] was legalized only in 1987, and the legalization was the result of a struggle between different governments and conservative groups, mostly connected to the [[Catholic Church]], that lasted a whole century. In 1987, President [[Raúl Alfonsín]] was successful in passing the divorce law, following a ruling of the Supreme Court. The new law also provided for [[gender equality]] between the wife and husband.&lt;ref name="State pp 102"&gt;''Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin. American Dictatorships and Democracies'', by Mala Htun, pp 102&lt;/ref&gt; By 1987, when divorce was legalized, only three other Latin American countries prohibited divorce (Paraguay and Colombia, which legalized it 1991,&lt;ref name="State pp 102"/&gt; and Chile which legalized it in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4021427.stm|title=Chile introduces right to divorce|date=18 November 2004|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Adultery]] was decriminalized in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impowr.org/content/current-legal-framework-adultery-argentina|title=Current Legal Framework: Adultery in Argentina - impowr.org|website=Impowr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a new ''Civil and Commercial Code'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm|title=InfoLEG - Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas Públicas - Argentina|first=|last=Mecon|website=Infoleg.gob.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; modernizing [[family law]], came into force in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuevodiarioweb.com.ar/nota/elpais/621051/cristina-destaco-importancia-nuevo-codigo-civil-comercial.html|title=Página no encontrada - Nuevo Diario|website=Nuevodiarioweb.com.ar|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623044951/http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial |date=2016-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic violence==
[[File:Marcha_Ni_una_menos_1.JPG|thumb|left|Mass protest against [[violence against women]] in [[Buenos Aires]] in 2015]]
{{main|Domestic violence in Argentina|Domestic violence}}
[[Violence against women]] is a serious problem in Argentina. [[Amnesty International]] reported in February 2012 that a woman died every two days as a result of [[domestic violence]] in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaje.org/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/12/2011/07/Presentac.ppt]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218072343/http://www.gaje.org/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/12/2011/07/Presentac.ppt |date=2015-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The civil society organization La Casa del Encuentro reported that between January and September 2013, 209 women died as a result of domestic or gender-based violence.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

In 2009, Argentina enacted ''Ley de protección integral para prevenir, sancionar y erradicar la violencia contra las mujeres en los ámbitos en que desarrollen sus relacion es interpersonales [Ley 26.485]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/dil/esp/Ley_de_Proteccion_Integral_de_Mujeres_Argentina.pdf|format=PDF|title=LEY DE PROTECCION INTEGRAL A LAS MUJERES|website=Oas.org|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Comprehensive Law on the Prevention, Punishment and Elimination of Violence against Women in their Interpersonal Relations [Law 26.485]).

In November 2012, the Congress passed an anti [[femicide]] law imposing stricter penalties on perpetrators who kill their spouses, partners, or children as a consequence of gender based violence.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

According to the [[Human Rights Watch]]’s 2018 world report, 254 femicides were reported, but only 22 convictions were done in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/argentina|title=Argentina Events of 2017|work=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Outline of domestic violence}}

==Human trafficking==
{{main|Human trafficking in Argentina}}
While individual prostitution is legal in Argentina, the promotion, facilitation, or forcing of people into [[prostitution]] is illegal. Argentina is a source, transit, and destination country for sex trafficking of women. Sex trafficking victims often come from Paraguay and the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://photos.state.gov/libraries/argentina/8513/reports/TraffickingPersonsReport2013.pdf|format=PDF|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2013 : OFFICE TO MONITOR AND COMBAT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS|website=Photos.state.gov|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rape and sexual harassment==
[[Sexual harassment]] in the public sector is prohibited and is subject to disciplinary or corrective measures. In some jurisdictions, such as Buenos Aires City, sexual harassment may lead to the abuser’s dismissal, but in others, such as in Santa Fe Province, the maximum penalty is five days in prison.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

The law prohibits rape, including spousal rape; but the need for proof, either in the form of clear physical injury or the testimony of a witness, has often presented difficulties in prosecuting such crimes. Women’s rights advocates have accused the police, hospitals, and courts of hostile attitudes against victims of sexual violence.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

The 2009 law on violence against women (Law 26.485) has comprehensive provisions against sexual violence, including sexual violence within marriage (in particular Article 5(3)&lt;ref&gt;ARTICULO 5º Tipos (...) 3.- Sexual: Cualquier acción que implique la vulneración en todas sus formas, con o sin acceso genital, del derecho de la mujer de decidir voluntariamente acerca de su vida sexual o reproductiva a través de amenazas, coerción, uso de la fuerza o intimidación, incluyendo la violación dentro del matrimonio o de otras relaciones vinculares o de parentesco, exista o no convivencia, así como la prostitución forzada, explotación, esclavitud, acoso, abuso sexual y trata de mujeres.[http://www.oas.org/dil/esp/Ley_de_Proteccion_Integral_de_Mujeres_Argentina.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Before a change in law in 1999, sexual offenses were classified as "Offences against honesty", and the concept of "honest woman" appeared in certain sexual crimes. Act No. 25,087 of 1999 (''Ley N° 25.087'') reformed the legislation, and changed its name to "Offences against sexual integrity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoleg.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/15000-19999/16546/texact.htm#17|title=CODIGO PENAL DE LA NACION ARGENTINA|website=Infoleg.gov.ar|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/slavery/?page=countries&amp;category=2&amp;country=7#Act+No.+25,087+on+%C3%A2%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BDOffences+against+sexual+integrity%C3%A2%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD+7+May+1999|title=Slavery in Domestic Legislation : Country : Argentina|website=Qub.ac.uk|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic gender gap==
[[File:Fabrica-calzado-Argentina.jpg|thumb|250 px|Women workers at a sportshoes factory in Las Flores, [[Buenos Aires Province]], Argentina]]
Although since the 1869 enactment of the [[Argentine Civil Code]], all citizens are considered equal, and the [[Constitution of Argentina]] also states at Section 16 that "The Argentine Nation admits neither blood nor birth prerogatives: there are neither personal privileges nor titles of nobility. All its inhabitants are equal before the law, and admissible to employment without any other requirement than their ability. Equality is the basis of taxation and public burdens",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senado.gov.ar/deInteresEnglish]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022134856/http://www.senado.gov.ar/deInteresEnglish |date=2013-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; women often encounter economic discrimination and hold a disproportionately higher number of lower-paying jobs. Approximately 70 percent of women employed outside the home work in unskilled jobs, although more women than men hold university degrees.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; According to a 2007 study by the Foundation for Latin American Economic Research (FIEL), men earned 5 percent more than women for equivalent full-time work in the [[Greater Buenos Aires]] area, and earned 21 percent more than women for equivalent part-time work, an imbalance explicitly prohibited by law: prison terms of up to three years can be issued for discrimination based on gender.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Restrictions on abortion==
[[File:Clara Oyuela.jpg|thumb|150 px|right|Clara Oyuela, (1907-2001) Argentine opera singer]]
[[File:Gabriela Sabatini.jpg|thumb|150 px|right|[[Gabriela Sabatini]], Argentine former professional tennis player]]
[[Abortion in Argentina]] remains prohibited, and is legal only in cases of rape, or where the life of the mother is in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.despenalizacion.org.ar/pdf/Hojas_Informativas/09_Bergallo_Michel.pdf|title=Despenalización |language=Spanish|website=Despenalizacion.org.ar|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Argentine Penal Code 846, moreover, was amended in 2008 to place stricter sanctions against women who seek an abortion, as well as any medical staff involved in the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annualreview.law.harvard.edu/population/abortion/Argentina.abo.htm|title=''Harvard Law Review'': Abortion rights in Argentina|website=Annualreview.law.harvard.edu|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These limitations notwithstanding, an estimated 500,000 abortions are performed annually in Argentina (compared to around 700,000 live births), resulting in at least 10,000 hospitalizations due to complications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-85908-2007-06-02.html|title=Página/12 :: El país :: Las cifras para abrir el debate|website=Pagina12.com.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; (estimates vary widely)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laplaza/2007/11/how-many-aborti.html|title=How many abortions in Mexico?|date=19 November 2007|website=Latimesblogs.latimes.com|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around 100 deaths (a third of all [[maternal mortality]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/es/news/2005/06/15/decisions-denied-women-s-access-contraceptives-and-abortion-argentina|title=Decisions Denied: Women’s Access to Contraceptives and Abortion in Argentina|date=15 June 2005|website=Hrw.org|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/news-articles-press/politics-policy-issues/international-issues/abortion-in-argentina.htm|title=Planned Parenthood: Abortion in Argentina|website=Plannedparenthood.org|accessdate=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012093657/http://www.plannedparenthood.org/news-articles-press/politics-policy-issues/international-issues/abortion-in-argentina.htm|archive-date=12 October 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraception and reproductive rights==
Traditionally, access to [[contraceptive]]s has long been discouraged by a succession of Argentine governments,&lt;ref name=hrw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/es/news/2005/06/15/argentina-limits-birth-control-threaten-human-rights|title=Argentina: Limits on Birth Control Threaten Human Rights|date=15 June 2005|website=Hrw.org|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which instead rewarded large families with subsidies rising disproportionately with the seventh child.&lt;ref name=fabrica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/04/05/um/m-01891849.htm|title=La fábrica de hijos: conciben en serie y obtienen una mejor pensión del Estado|website=Clarin.com|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Argentine women have long had among Latin America's lowest birth rates (averaging 2.3 births per woman in recent years), the policy has tended to encourage higher birth rates in the lowest strata of society (including women least able to afford large families).&lt;ref name=fabrica/&gt; Contraceptives are widely used by sexually active Argentine women, as [[condom]]s are by Argentine men, and a variety of birth control products can be obtained freely in pharmacies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/argentina.html|title=''The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality'': Argentina. Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, 1997|website=2.hu-berlin.de|accessdate=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831003059/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/argentina.html|archive-date=31 August 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Argentine government began their free distribution in 2003.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt; In general, couples and individuals have the right to decide freely the number, spacing, and timing of children, and have access to information and reproductive health services. The law requires the government to provide free contraceptives.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

==Women in politics==
Traditionally, politics was seen a male domain. The legal and social roles of women in Argentina were mostly dictated by the Spanish Law (which itself was based on Roman law) and by the Catholic Church. As such, women were subordinated first to their fathers and then to their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/feminism/arg.html|title=Feminism in Argentina|first=Kristin|last=Switala|website=Cddc.vt.edu|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, however, women have a notable presence in Argentinian politics, and they make up more than a third of the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm|title=Women in Parliaments: World Classification|website=Ipu.org|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina had two female presidents: [[Isabel Martínez de Perón]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]].

==Advocacy and international law==
The National Council of Women carries out programs to promote equal social, political, and economic opportunities for women. The council worked with the special representative for international women's issues, the Ministry of Labor, and union and business organizations to form the Tripartite Committee on Equal Opportunity for Men and Women in the Workplace, which seeks to foster equal treatment and opportunities for men and women in the job market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/wha/119145.htm Report on Human Rights Practices 2008: Argentina]. [[United States]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (March 6, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Argentina ratified the [[Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW). In 1994, the [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|National Constituent Convention]] incorporated the ratification of the CEDAW into the text of the new constitution. During the 1990s, some laws began to tackle domestic violence, by empowering police agencies and provincial judicial authorities to establish preventive measures. Although the Government of Argentina ratified the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women in 1996 (enacted in the 1994 Convention of [[Belem do Pará]]), not all Argentine provinces have promulgated regulations for its application. Despite the creation in 1985 of the Women's Department under the auspices of the Office of the President, provincial delegations or Women's Sections still have not been established throughout the entire nation.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo, Irene.

'''The York Club''' is a private [[social club]] that was incorporated on November 22, 1909. It is located at 135 St. George Street in [[The Annex]] neighbourhood of central [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, close to the [[University of Toronto]].

The club's building was originally constructed in 1889 as a residence for businessman George Gooderham Sr. (1830–1905)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/gooderham_george_13E.html Dean Beeby, “GOODERHAM, GEORGE,”] in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 13, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed October 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and his large family, taking nearly three years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The York Club|url=http://occasionaltoronto.blogspot.com/2011/02/york-club.html|work=Occasional Toronto|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home was designed in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style by architect David Roberts Jr., who also designed the [[Gooderham Building]] downtown.

After George Gooderham Sr. died in May 1905, at the age of 75, his widow Harriet Gooderham (''née'' Dean) sold the house and moved to a smaller home at 224 St. George Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=York Club|url=http://www.lostrivers.ca/points/yorkclub.htm|work=Points of Interest Along Lost Streams|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The York Club has owned the building since 1910.
