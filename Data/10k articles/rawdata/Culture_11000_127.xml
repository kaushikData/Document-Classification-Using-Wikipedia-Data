'''Alpine Pearls''' is a cooperation which has been established in 2006 and formed of 25 tourism municipalities in six [[Alpine states|alpine countries]]. The [[tourism]] association’s objective is to support and promote Soft Mobility: that is offering the possibility for guests to arrive without a car at the holiday destination and to have easy access to [[public transportation]] on site as well as numerous offers of [[environmentally friendly]] holiday programmes. The cooperation’s members fulfill strict quality criteria like town centers with [[Traffic calming|reduced traffic]], transfer services, environmentally friendly leisure time facilities, the guarantee of mobility without car and ecological minimum standards. The individual member municipalities (referred to as Pearls) benefit from the exchange of experiences among each other.

== Development of Alpine Pearls ==
Alpine Pearls is the result of two successive EU projects (Alps Mobility and Alps Mobility II – Alpine Pearls). The emphasis was put on creating innovative, [[sustainable tourism]] offers which combine tourist [[Tourist attraction|sights]] with Soft Mobility advantages; connecting the sights with ecological transportation. The achievements are used further and put into practice by the [[Umbrella organization|head organization]] Alpine Pearls which operates in the entire Alps.

'''Anne Oldfield''' (1683{{snd}}23 October 1730) was an [[England|English]] [[actress]].  She was born in [[London]], to Anne Gourlaw and William Oldfield, a soldier.

==Early life and discovery==
Despite her rough economic background, Oldfield must have had a basic education because her biographers recount that she read plays voraciously throughout her youth.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gore-Browne, ''Gay was the Pit: the Life and Times of Anne Oldfield, Actress (1683–1730)'' (London: Max Reinhardt, 1957), p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1699, she attracted [[George Farquhar]]'s attention when he overheard her reciting lines from [[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]’s play ''The Scornful Lady'' (1616) in a back room of her tavern. Soon after, she was hired by [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]] to join the cast of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gore-Browne, ''Gay was the Pit: the Life and Times of Anne Oldfield, Actress (1683–1730)'' (London: Max Reinhardt, 1957), 18–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
It took nearly a year before she landed her first small role as Candiope in [[John Dryden]]’s ''Secret Love; or, The Maiden Queen'' (1699). After her success in a minor role, she was given the lead in [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]’s ''The Pilgrim'' (1647).&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Lafler, ''The Celebrated Mrs. Oldfield: the Life and Art of an Augustan Actress'' (Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), 16–7.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Oldfield wasn't truly noticed until the summer of 1703 when [[Susanna Verbruggen]]'s contract was terminated before the company traveled to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to perform for [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and her court.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Lafler, ''The Celebrated Mrs. Oldfield: the Life and Art of an Augustan Actress'' (Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldfield became one of Drury Lane's leading actresses. [[Colley Cibber]] acknowledged that she had as much as he to do with the success of his ''The Careless Husband'' (1704), in which she created the part of Lady Modish. Of her portrayal of Lady Townly in his ''The Provok'd Husband'' (1728), Cibber was to say, "that here she outdid her usual Outdoing."  She also played the title role in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicoene]]'', and Celia in his ''[[Volpone]]''. In tragedy, too, she won laurels, and the list of her parts, many of them original, is a long and varied one.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Oldfield, Anne|volume=20|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London gossip believed there to be rivalries between Oldfield, [[Anne Bracegirdle]], Jane Rogers and [[Susannah Centlivre]], all of whom were supposedly vying for the best roles.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Melville, ''Stage Favourites of the Eighteenth Century'' (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday Doran &amp; Company, Inc., 1929), 19–21&lt;/ref&gt; In 1706 Oldfield entered a conflict with the Drury Lane's management over benefits and salary she believed she had been promised, but which the theater refused to provide. Oldfield left and joined the competing acting company at [[Haymarket Theatre]] before returning to Drury Lane shortly after with a fresh contract and a new position as joint-sharer of the Drury Lane Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Nussbaum, ''Rival Queens: Actresses, Performance, and the Eighteenth-Century British Theater'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; On a separate occasion, Oldfield was offered to become manager of the Theatre, "but her sex was thought to be an objection to that measure" thus being asked to name her own terms to stay in her old position, Oldfield received 200 guieneas salary, which was ultimately raised to 500 guineas - ensuring Oldfield was the highest paid actress of her time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Anne Oldfield began a decade-long relationship with Whig politician [[Arthur Maynwaring]] sometime around 1700. Despite the fact that previous generations of actresses relied heavily on the patronage of their lovers, Oldfield remained financially independent from Maynwaring.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Lafler, ''The Celebrated Mrs. Oldfield: the Life and Art of an Augustan Actress'' (Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), 27–31.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported her career by helping her work through new roles and by writing more than a dozen prologues and epilogues for her to perform.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Parsons, “Mrs. Oldfield," Mary Hays, ''Female Biography; or, Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women, of All Ages and Countries'' (1803). ''Chawton House Library Series: Women’s Memoirs'', ed. Gina Luria Walker, ''Memoirs of Women Writers Part III.'' Pickering &amp; Chatto: London, 2013, vol. 10, vol. 10, 30–3, editorial notes, 548-51, on 550.&lt;/ref&gt; When she became pregnant with their son, Arthur, Oldfield kept acting until she was physically unable, an unusual decision in a time when most actresses were pressured to take a leave of absence throughout the duration of their pregnancy. She went back to work just three months after the birth.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Engel and Elaine M. McGirr, eds, ''Stage Mothers: Women, Work, and the Theater, 1660–1830'' (Lenham, Maryland: Bucknell University Press, 2014), p. 45-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In her turn Oldfield arranged for her lifelong friend [[Margaret Saunders]] to join the acting profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Saunders, Margaret (DNB00)|last=|first=|year=|publisher=|page=|wspage=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Maynwaring died in 1712, Oldfield was tortured with rumors that he had died from a venereal disease that she had given to him. In order to clear both their names, she ordered an official autopsy to be performed on her former lover's body, which revealed that he had, in fact, died of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Engel and Elaine M. McGirr, eds, ''Stage Mothers: Women, Work, and the Theater, 1660–1830'' (Lenham, Maryland: Bucknell University Press, 2014), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Oldfield was three months pregnant at the time, but her child is not believed to have survived the birth.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Parsons, “Mrs. Oldfield," Mary Hays, ''Female Biography; or, Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women, of All Ages and Countries'' (1803). ''Chawton House Library Series: Women’s Memoirs'', ed. Gina Luria Walker, ''Memoirs of Women Writers Part III.'' Pickering &amp; Chatto: London, 2013, vol. 10, vol. 10, 30–3, editorial notes, 548-51, on 550.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years after Maynwaring's death, Oldfield began a relationship with [[Charles Churchill (British Army lieutenant-general)|Charles Churchill]]. The two lived together for many years and had a son, [[Charles Churchill (of Chalfont)|Charles]]. However, during this pregnancy, Oldfield had many negative side effects and was forced to leave the theater for several months. She never fully recovered her health.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Engel and Elaine M. McGirr, eds, ''Stage Mothers: Women, Work, and the Theater, 1660–1830'' (Lenham, Maryland: Bucknell University Press, 2014), p. 53-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her last theatrical season she suffered from chronic pain in her abdomen. She retired from the stage in April 1730 and died from cancer in her reproductive organs a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Lafler, ''The Celebrated Mrs. Oldfield: the Life and Art of an Augustan Actress'' (Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial==
Anne Oldfield was the theatrical idol of her day. Her exquisite acting and ladylike carriage were the delight of her contemporaries, and her beauty and generosity found innumerable eulogists, as well as sneering detractors. [[Alexander Pope]], in his ''Sober Advice from Horace'', wrote of her "Engaging Oldfield, who, with grace and ease, Could join the arts to ruin and to please."  It was to her that he alluded as the lady who detested being buried in woollen, who said to her maid "No, let a charming chintz and Brussels lace Wrap my cold limbs and shade my lifeless face; One would not, sure, be frightful when one's dead, And Betty give this cheek a little red."&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Oldfield, Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldfield was forty-seven when she died on 23 October 1730 at 60 Grosvenor Street, London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plaquesoflondon.co.uk/page1286.html English Heritage plaque for Oldfield at plaquesoflondon.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;  She divided her property, for that time a large one, between her two sons. Oldfield was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], beneath the monument to [[William Congreve (playwright)|Congreve]]. Her partner, Churchill, applied for permission to erect a monument there to her memory, but the dean of Westminster refused it.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Parsons, “Mrs. Oldfield," Mary Hays, ''Female Biography; or, Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women, of All Ages and Countries'' (1803). ''Chawton House Library Series: Women’s Memoirs'', ed. Gina Luria Walker, ''Memoirs of Women Writers Part III''. Pickering &amp; Chatto: London, 2013, vol. 10, vol. 10, 30–3, editorial notes, 548-51, on 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anthotype''' is an [[image]] created using [[photosensitive]] material from [[plants]]. This  process was originally invented by [[Sir John Herschel]] in 1842. An [[emulsion]] is made from crushed flower petals or any other light-sensitive plant, fruit or vegetable. A coated sheet of paper is then dried. Place some material, for example leaves or a transparent photo positive on the paper and expose to direct full sunlight until the image part not covered by the material is bleached out by the sun rays. The color remains or fades  in the shadowed parts. The paper remains sensitive against such rays.

==History==
The photo-sensitive properties of plants and vegetables have been known to scholars for centuries. Among many early observations the experiments of [[Henri August Vogel]] in [[Paris]] are of particular interest. He discovered in 1816:

An alcoholic [[tincture]] of either red [[carnation]]s, [[violet (plant)|violet]]s or [[corn poppy]] turned white behind blue glass in a few days, while it remained unchanged behind red glass after about the same time. Cotton and paper colored with these tinctures exhibited the same differences.

Later that century Herschel attempted to invent a color process, he tried several flower and plant emulsions and published his findings. His research resulted in the anthotype process. It should be pointed out that his research into making photographic images from flowers was limited and was ultimately abandoned since no commercial application was feasible from a process which takes days to produce an image. The process continued to be listed in photographic literature of the time but was likely little used.

Over time the process has earned a misleading reputation for being simply too impractical. Image permanence have been brought into question to this day but this problem seems to be mostly related to choice of flower or plant matter.

==How it works==
{{quote|From an examination of the researches of Sir John Herschel on the coloring matter of plants, it will be seen that the action of the sun's rays is to destroy the color, effecting a sort of [[chromatic analysis]], in which two distinct elements of color are separated, by destroying the one and leaving the other. The action is confined within the [[visible spectrum]], and thus a broad distinction is exhibited between the action of the sun's rays on vegetable juices and on [[Silver|argentine]] compounds, the latter being most sensibly affected by the invisible rays beyond the violet. 
It may also be observed, that the rays effective in destroying a given tint, are in a great many cases, those whose union produces a color complementary to the tint destroyed, or, at least, one belonging to that class of colors to which such complementary tint may be preferred. For instance, yellows tending towards orange are destroyed with more energy by the blue rays; blues by the red, orange and yellow rays; purples and pinks by yellow and green rays.|Henry H. Snelling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/tech/photography/HistoryandPracticeoftheArtofPhotography/chap4.html |title=History and Practice of the Art of Photography - Chapter III |publisher=Worldwideschool.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other flower suggestions==
Henry H. Snelling writes based on his research: "[[Viola odorata]]--or sweet scented violet, yields to alcohol a rich blue color, which it imparts in high perfection to paper. [[Senecio Splendens]] -- or double purple [[Senecio vulgaris|groundsel]], yields a beautiful color to paper."

Bingham, quoting by [[John Herschel|Sir John Herschel]], recommends Corchorus japonicus flower (japanese Jute) for a "''fine yellow colour''" that "''upon exposure to sunlight, it is in about half an hour rendered quite white''". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/photogenicmanipu00bing|title=Photogenic manipulation. containing the theory and plain instructions in the art of photography, or the production of pictures through the agency of light : including calotype, fluorotype, ferrotype, chromotype, chrysotype, cyanotype, catalissisotype and anthotype|last=Bingham|first=Robert J.|date=1847|publisher=London : George Knight and Sons|others=Getty Research Institute|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aidoh''' is an [[shortening]] for ''Art In Defence Of Humanism''. AIDOH was created by the Danish artist [[Jens Galschiot]] as a [[interest group|group]] focusing on the inhuman treatment of [[people]] in different countries related to political, religious or economic interests. The group has with several occasions started a public debate about the individual countries overconsumption or governments repressive treatment of its own [[people]].

==Manifests==

===My inner beast (1993)===
[[Pigs]] in coats made of 1 ton black [[concrete]]. Is named one of the biggest art [[happening]]s in [[Europe]]. 20 sculptures were placered on public places in [[Europe]] without official approval. It took 55 hours to put the "pigs" up, and the [[happening]] created a lot of public debate.

===The silent death (1995)===
In connection with [[UN]]'s sociale [[summit]] in [[Copenhagen]], were there placed 750 dolls, that pictured dead children in the age of 3–9 years. They were placed on street lamps, benches, fountains and other places to symbolizes the 35.000 children's that dies every day in the [[world]].

===[[Pillar of Shame]] (1997)===
Were placed in [[Hong Kong]] June 4, 1997. Since it has been placed in many other places in the world where the governments does not respect the [[human right]]s. 
The [[Pillar of Shame]] is in copper and is 8 meters tall. It consists of more than 50 tangled human bodies in pain. 
The [[Pillar of Shame]] is like a [[Nobel Prize]] in injustice.

===[[WTO]] Hong Kong (2005)===
Following sculptures were placed in [[Hong Kong]] at December 2005:
* Mad Cow Disease
* The survival of the fattest
* Hunger match

===[[In the name of God (art installation)|In the name of God]] (2006)===
[[In the name of God (art installation)|In the name of God]] is a number of art installations, that puts focus on Catholics prohibition against the use of [[condoms]]. It consists of a crucified pregnant teenager. It has been exhibited in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Kenya]].

Located along the [[Tigris|Tigris River]], the city was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Within a short time of its inception, Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center for the [[Islamic world]]. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions (e.g., [[House of Wisdom]]), garnered the city a worldwide reputation as the "Centre of Learning". 

Baghdad was the largest city of the [[Middle Ages]] for much of the Abbasid era, peaking at a population of more than a million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |title= Largest Cities Through History |publisher= Geography.about.com |date= 2011-04-06 |accessdate= 2011-06-19 |archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/5PpFbcLVp?url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm# |archive-date= 24 June 2007 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city was largely [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destroyed]] at the hands of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent state (formerly the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]) in 1938, Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of [[Arab culture]]. 

In contemporary times, the city has often faced severe infrastructural damage, most recently due to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and the subsequent [[Iraq War]] that lasted until December 2011. In recent years, the city has been frequently subjected to [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgency]] attacks.  The war had resulted in a [[Archaeological looting in Iraq|substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts]] as well. {{As of|2012}}, Baghdad was listed as one of the least hospitable places in the world to live,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=What city has world's best quality of life? | newspaper=CNN | author=Inocencio, Ramy | date=4 December 2012 | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/04/business/global-city-quality-life/index.html | access-date=4 December 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204214252/http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/04/business/global-city-quality-life/index.html# | archive-date=4 December 2012 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ranked by [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] as the worst of 221 major cities as measured by quality-of-life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21569077-one-africas-most-miserable-countries-looks-unstable-ever-brink# |title=The Central African Republic: On the brink |access-date=24 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013221139/https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21569077-one-africas-most-miserable-countries-looks-unstable-ever-brink# |archive-date=13 October 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few authors have suggested older origins for the name, in particular the name ''Bagdadu'' or ''Hudadu'' that existed in Old Babylonian (spelled with a sign that can represent both ''bag'' and ''hu''), and the Babylonian Talmudic name of a place called "Baghdatha".&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John B.

When the Abbasid caliph, [[al-Mansur]], founded a completely new city for his capital, he chose the name [[Round City of Baghdad|Madinat al-Salaam]] or ''City of Peace''. This was the official name on coins, weights, and other official usage, although the common people continued to use the old name.&lt;ref name="ما معنى اسم مدينة بغداد ومن سماه ؟"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seenjeem.maktoob.com/question?category_id=4&amp;level=L2&amp;question_id=9510 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713093613/http://seenjeem.maktoob.com/question?category_id=4&amp;level=L2&amp;question_id=9510 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 July 2012 |title=ما معنى اسم مدينة بغداد ومن سماه ؟ |publisher=Seenjeem.maktoob.com |accessdate=27 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ejabat.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejabat.google.com/ejabat/thread?tid=6981074380f32f74|website=[[Google Questions and Answers|Google Ejabat]]|accessdate=27 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229160415/http://ejabat.google.com/ejabat/thread?tid=6981074380f32f74|archivedate=29 December 2013|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2017}} By the 11th century, "Baghdad" became almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.

They chose a site north of the [[Sassanid]] capital of [[Ctesiphon]] (and also just north of where ancient [[Babylon]] had once stood), and on 30 July 762&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] commissioned the construction of the city. It was built under the supervision of the [[Barmakids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Mansur loved the site so much he is quoted saying: "This is indeed the city that I am to found, where I am to live, and where my descendants will reign afterward".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The city's growth was helped by its excellent location, based on at least two factors: it had control over strategic and trading routes along the [[Tigris]], and it had an abundance of water in a dry climate. Water exists on both the north and south ends of the city, allowing all households to have a plentiful supply, which was very uncommon during this time.

Baghdad eclipsed Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sassanians, which was located some {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southeast. Today, all that remains of Ctesiphon is the shrine town of [[Salman Pak]], just to the south of Greater Baghdad. Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed [[Seleucia]], the first capital of the [[Seleucid Empire]], which had earlier replaced the city of [[Babylon]].

According to the traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], Baghdad was one of the largest cities, not including the damage it has received. The residents are mostly Hanbal. Bagdad is also home to the grave of Abu Hanifa where there is a cell and a mosque above it. The Sultan of Bagdad, Abu Said Bahadur Khan, was a Tartar king who embraced Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Battuta, pg. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early years, the city was known as a deliberate reminder of an expression in the [[Qur'an]], when it refers to [[Paradise]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiet, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; It took four years to build (764–768). Mansur assembled engineers, surveyors, and art constructionists from around the world to come together and draw up plans for the city. Over 100,000 construction workers came to survey the plans; many were distributed salaries to start the building of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corzine|first=Phyllis|title=The Islamic Empire|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; July was chosen as the starting time because two [[Astrology|astrologers]], [[Naubakht|Naubakht Ahvazi]] and [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]], believed that the city should be built under the sign of the [[Mesopotamian lion|lion]], [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiet, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Leo is associated with fire and symbolises productivity, pride, and expansion.

The bricks used to make the city were {{convert|18|in|mm}} on all four sides. [[Abu Hanifa]]h was the counter of the bricks and he developed a canal, which brought water to the work site for both human consumption and the manufacture of the bricks. Marble was also used to make buildings throughout the city, and marble steps led down to the river's edge.

The basic framework of the city consists of two large semicircles about {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter. The city was designed as a circle about {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} in diameter, leading it to be known as the "Round City". The original design shows a single ring of residential and commercial structures along the inside of the city walls, but the final construction added another ring inside the first.&lt;ref name="ox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamicceramics.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/Abbasid/baghdad.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030325090348/http://islamicceramics.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/Abbasid/baghdad.htm |archivedate=25 March 2003 |dead-url=yes |title=Abbasid Ceramics: Plan of Baghdad |publisher=web.archive.org |accessdate=5 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the city there were many parks, gardens, villas, and promenades.&lt;ref&gt;"Yakut: Baghdad under the Abbasids, c. 1000CE"&lt;/ref&gt; In the center of the city lay the [[mosque]], as well as headquarters for guards. The purpose or use of the remaining space in the center is unknown. The circular design of the city was a direct reflection of the traditional Persian Sasanian [[urban planning|urban design]]. The Sasanian city of [[Firuzabad, Fars|Gur]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]], built 500 years before Baghdad, is nearly identical in its general circular design, radiating avenues, and the government buildings and temples at the centre of the city. This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles.

{{wide image|The historical city of Babylon.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view over the ancient city of [[Babylon]], located {{convert|85|km|abbr=on}} south of Baghdad.}}

===Surrounding walls===
{{see also|Gates of Baghdad}}
The four surrounding walls of Baghdad were named [[Kufa]], [[Basra]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and [[Syria]]; named because their gates pointed in the directions of these destinations. The distance between these gates was a little less than {{convert|1.5|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Each gate had double doors that were made of iron; the doors were so heavy it took several men to open and close them. The wall itself was about 44&amp;nbsp;m thick at the base and about 12&amp;nbsp;m thick at the top. Also, the wall was 30&amp;nbsp;m high, which included [[merlon]]s, a solid part of an embattled parapet usually pierced by [[embrasure]]s. This wall was surrounded by another wall with a thickness of 50&amp;nbsp;m. The second wall had towers and rounded merlons, which surrounded the towers. This outer wall was protected by a solid [[glacis]], which is made out of bricks and [[quicklime]]. Beyond the outer wall was a water-filled moat.

====Golden Gate Palace====
The Golden Gate Palace, the residence of the caliph and his family, was in the middle of Baghdad, in the central square. In the central part of the building, there was a green dome that was 39&amp;nbsp;m high. Surrounding the palace was an [[esplanade]], a waterside building, in which only the caliph could come riding on horseback. In addition, the palace was near other mansions and officer's residences. Near the Gate of Syria, a building served as the home for the guards. It was made of brick and marble. The palace governor lived in the latter part of the building and the commander of the guards in the front. In 813, after the death of caliph [[Al-Amin]], the palace was no longer used as the home for the caliph and his family.&lt;ref&gt;Wiet, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
The roundness points to the fact that it was based on [[Arabic script]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

====Abbasids and the round city====
[[File:Baghdad 150 to 300 AH.gif|thumb|upright|The [[Round city of Baghdad]] between 767 and 912&amp;nbsp;AD]]
The justification for the Abbasid Caliphate was based on the Abbasids being the descendants of the uncle of [[Muhammad]] and being part of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe. They used [[Shi'a]] resentment, [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]ian movement, and appeals to the ambitions and traditions of the newly conquered Persian aristocracy to overthrow the [[Umayyads]].&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of the Medieval World pg. 78&lt;/ref&gt;
The Abbasids sought to combine the hegemony of the [[Arabs|Arab]] tribes with the imperial, court, ceremonial, and administrative structures of the Persians. The Abbasids considered themselves the inheritors of Arab-Islamic culture. Harun al-Rashid needed to place the capital in a place that was representative of Arab-Islamic identity and  built the [[House of Wisdom]], where ancient texts were translated from their original language, such as Greek, to Arabic. Al-Ma'mun is credited with the "[[Translation Movement]]" for this.

===Center of learning (8th to 13th centuries)===
{{Further information|Islamic Golden Age}}
[[File:المدرسة المستنصرية في بغداد (3).jpg|thumb|left|Courtyard of [[Mustansiriya Madrasah|Mustansiriya]] madrasa, established by [[Al-Mustansir (Baghdad)|Al-Mustansir]] in 1227]]
Within a generation of its founding, Baghdad became a hub of [[learning]] and [[commerce]]. ''[[House of Wisdom|Baytul-Hikmah]]'' or the "House of Wisdom", initially founded as a library for private use by [[Harun al-Rashid]], flourished into an unrivaled intellectual center of [[science]], [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], and [[education]] and had the largest selection of books in the world by the middle of the 9th century.&lt;ref name="AK"&gt;Al-Khalili, pp. 67-78&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdad was likely the [[Historical urban community sizes|largest city in the world]] from shortly after its foundation until the 930s, when it  tied with [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |title=Largest Cities Through History |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5PpFbcLVp?url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm# |archive-date=24 June 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several estimates suggest that the city contained over a million inhabitants at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;Matt T. Rosenberg, [http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm ''Largest Cities Through History''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5PpFbcLVp?url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm# |date=24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' tales, widely known as the ''Arabian Nights'', are set in Baghdad during this period.

Among the notable features of Baghdad during this period were its exceptional libraries. Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids were the first to foster Greek learning on a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only for the use of the owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character.&lt;ref name=mackensen&gt;Mackensen, Ruth Stellhorn . (1932). Four Great Libraries of Medieval Baghdad. ''The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy'', Vol. 2, No. 3 (July 1932), pp. 279-299. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Four great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period. The earliest was that of the famous Al Mamun, who was caliph from 813 to 833. Another was established by Sabur Ibn Ardashir in 991 or 993 for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy.&lt;ref name=mackensen/&gt; Unfortunately, this second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established. This was a good example of the sort of library built up out of the needs and interests of a literary society.&lt;ref name=mackensen/&gt; The last two were examples of ''madrasa'' or theological college libraries. The Nizamiyah was founded by the Persian Nizam al Mulk, who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans.&lt;ref name=mackensen/&gt; It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in 1258. The Mustansiriyah ''madrasa'', which owned an exceedingly rich library, was founded by Al Mustansir, the second last Abbasid caliph, who died in 1242.&lt;ref name=mackensen/&gt; This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad.

Schellinger|year=1996|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|page=116|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdad's early meteoric growth eventually slowed due to troubles within the [[Caliphate]], including relocations of the capital to [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]] (during 808–819 and 836–892), the loss of the western and easternmost provinces, and periods of political domination by the [[Iran]]ian [[Buwayhid]]s (945–1055) and [[Seljuk Turks]] (1055–1135).

The [[Seljuks]] were a clan of the [[Oghuz Turks]] from Central Asia that converted to the [[Sunni]] branch of Islam. In 1040, they destroyed the [[Ghaznavids]], taking over their land and in 1055, [[Tughril Beg]], the leader of the Seljuks, took over Baghdad. The Seljuks expelled the [[Buyid dynasty]] of Shiites that had ruled for some time and took over power and control of Baghdad. They ruled as [[Sultans]] in the name of the Abbasid caliphs (they saw themselves as being part of the Abbasid regime). Tughril Beg saw himself as the protector of the Abbasid Caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of the Medieval World pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Sieges and wars in which Baghdad was involved are listed below:

* [[Siege of Baghdad (812–813)]], Fourth Fitna (Caliphal Civil War)

In 1058, Baghdad was captured by the [[Fatimids]] under the Turkish general Abu'l-Ḥārith Arslān al-Basasiri, an adherent of the [[Ismailis]] along with the 'Uqaylid Quraysh.&lt;ref&gt;Virani, Shafique N. ''The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long before the arrival of the Saljuqs in Baghdad, al-Basasiri petitioned to the Fatimid Imam-Caliph [[Al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustansir]] to support him in conquering Baghdad on the Ismaili Imam's behalf. It has recently come to light that the famed Fatimid ''[[da'i]]'', al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi, had a direct role in supporting al-Basasiri and helped the general to succeed in taking [[Mosul|Mawṣil]], [[Wasit, Iraq|Wāsit]] and [[Kufa]]. Soon after,&lt;ref name="Daftary, Farhad 1990"&gt;Daftary, Farhad. ''The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990, 205-206.&lt;/ref&gt; by December 1058, a Shi'i ''[[adhān]]'' (call to prayer) was implemented in Baghdad and a ''[[khutbah]]'' (sermon) was delivered in the name of the Fatimid Imam-Caliph.&lt;ref name="Daftary, Farhad 1990"/&gt; Despite his Shi'i inclinations, Al-Basasiri received support from Sunnis and Shi'is alike, for whom opposition to the Saljuq power was a common factor.&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, Farhad.

[[File:DiezAlbumsFallOfBaghdad.jpg|thumb|left|Conquest of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258]]
On 10 February 1258, Baghdad was captured by the [[Mongols]] led by [[Hulegu]], a grandson of Chingiz Khan ([[Genghis Khan]]), during the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|siege of Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |date=18 January 2012 }}, George Modelski&lt;/ref&gt; Many quarters were ruined by fire, siege, or looting. The Mongols massacred most of the city's inhabitants, including the caliph [[Al-Musta'sim]], and destroyed large sections of the city. The [[canal]]s and [[Levee|dykes]] forming the city's [[irrigation]] system were also destroyed.

In 1534, Baghdad was [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–55)|captured]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]]. Under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], Baghdad continued into a period of decline, partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and Iranian Safavids, which did not accept the Sunni control of the city. [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639)|Between 1623 and 1638]], it returned to Iranian rule before falling back into Ottoman hands.

For a time, Baghdad had been the largest city in the Middle East. The city saw relative revival in the latter part of the 18th century under a [[Mamluk dynasty of Iraq|Mamluk]] government. Direct Ottoman rule was reimposed by [[Ali Rıza Pasha (governor of Baghdad)|Ali Rıza Pasha]] in 1831. From 1851 to 1852 and from 1861 to 1867, Baghdad was governed, under the Ottoman Empire by [[Mehmed Namık Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;Cetinsaya, Gokhan. ''Ottoman Administration of Iraq, 1890–1908''.

Baghdad and southern Iraq remained under Ottoman rule until 1917, when captured by the British during World War I. In 1920, Baghdad became the capital of the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]] and after receiving independence in 1932, the capital of the [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. The city's population grew from an estimated 145,000 in 1900 to 580,000 in 1950. During the Mandate, Baghdad's substantial [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Jewish community]] comprised a quarter of the city's population.&lt;ref name="GhareebDougherty2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edmund A.

On 1 April 1941, members of the "Golden Square" and [[Rashid Ali]] staged [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|a coup in Baghdad]]. Rashid Ali installed a pro-[[Nazi Germany|German]] and pro-[[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] government to replace the pro-British government of [[Regent]] [['Abd al-Ilah|Abdul Ilah]]. On 31 May, after the resulting [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] and after Rashid Ali and his government had fled, the Mayor of Baghdad surrendered to British and Commonwealth forces.

On 14 July 1958, members of the [[Iraqi Army]], under [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]], [[14 July Revolution|staged a coup to topple the Kingdom of Iraq]]. King [[Faisal II]], former Prime Minister [[Nuri as-Said]], former Regent Prince [['Abd al-Ilah]], members of the royal family, and others were brutally killed during the coup. Many of the victim's bodies were then dragged through the streets of Baghdad.

[[File:20160102-Tahrir square Baghdad.jpg|thumb|left|''Freedom Monument,''Tahrir square in Downtown Baghdad]]
During the 1970s, Baghdad experienced a period of prosperity and growth because of a sharp increase in the [[price of petroleum]], Iraq's main export. New infrastructure including modern sewerage, water, and highway facilities were built during this period. The masterplans of the city (1967, 1973) were delivered by the Polish planning office Miastoprojekt-Kraków, mediated by Polservice.&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, L., Miastoprojekt goes abroad: the transfer of architectural labour from socialist Poland to Iraq (1958–1989), The Journal of Architecture, Volume 17, Issue 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Iran–Iraq War]] of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money was diverted by [[Saddam Hussein]] to the army and thousands of residents were killed. Iran launched a number of missile attacks against Baghdad in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's continuous bombardments of Tehran's residential districts.

In 1991 and 2003, the [[Gulf War]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] caused [[Damage to Baghdad during the Iraq War|significant damage]] to Baghdad's transportation, [[Electricity generation|power]], and sanitary infrastructure as the US-led coalition forces launched massive aerial assaults in the city in the two wars.  Also in 2003, the minor riot in the city (which took place on 21 July) caused some disturbance in the population.

The historic "Assyrian Quarter" of the city, [[Dora, Baghdad|Dora]], which boasted a population of 150,000 [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]s in 2003, made up over 3% of the capital's Assyrian population then. The community has been subject to kidnappings, death threats, vandalism, and house burnings by [[Al-Qaeda]] and other insurgent groups. As of the end of 2014, only 1,500 Assyrians remained in Dora. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/11307515/Iraq-crisis-The-last-Christians-of-Dora.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413063147/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/11307515/Iraq-crisis-The-last-Christians-of-Dora.html# |archive-date=13 April 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Points of interest include the [[National Museum of Iraq]] whose priceless collection of artifacts was looted during the 2003 invasion, and the iconic Hands of Victory arches. Multiple Iraqi parties are in discussions as to whether the arches should remain as historical monuments or be dismantled. Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the [[Iraq National Library and Archive|National Library]] were destroyed under [[Saddam]]'s command.

===Mutanabbi Street===
{{Main article|Mutanabbi Street}}

Mutanabbi Street (Arabic: شارع المتنبي) is located near the old quarter of Baghdad; at Al Rasheed Street. It is the historic center of Baghdadi book-selling, a street filled with bookstores and outdoor book stalls. It was named after the 10th-century classical Iraqi poet [[Al-Mutanabbi]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes2008"&gt;{{cite news |title=Then and Now: A New Chapter for Baghdad Book Market |url=http://baghdadbureau.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/then-and-now-a-new-chapter-for-baghdad-book-market/?hp |work=The New York Times |first=Eric |last=Owles |date=December 18, 2008 |accessdate=May 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221035319/http://baghdadbureau.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/then-and-now-a-new-chapter-for-baghdad-book-market/?hp# |archive-date=21 December 2008 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This street is well established for bookselling and has often been referred to as the heart and soul of the Baghdad literacy and intellectual community.

===Baghdad Zoo===
{{Main article|Baghdad Zoo}}

The [[zoological park]] used to be the largest in the [[Middle East]]. Within eight days following the 2003 invasion, however, only 35 of the 650 animals in the facility survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food. [[South Africa]]n [[Lawrence Anthony]] and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with [[donkey]]s they had bought locally.&lt;ref name="BBC radio 4, zoo"&gt;{{cite web

===Grand Festivities Square===

[[Grand Festivities Square]] is the main square where public celebrations are held and is also the home to three important monuments commemorating Iraqi's fallen soldiers and victories in war; namely Al-Shaheed Monument, the [[Victory Arch]] and the [[The Monument to the Unknown Soldier|Unknown Soldier's Monument]].&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Shaheed Monument===
[[Al-Shaheed Monument]] ({{lang-ar|نصب الشهيد}}), also known as the Martyr's Memorial, is a monument dedicated to the Iraqi soldiers who died in the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. However, now it is generally considered by Iraqis to be for all of the martyrs of Iraq, especially those allied with Iran and Syria currently fighting ISIS, not just of the Iran–Iraq War. The Monument was opened in 1983, and was designed by the Iraqi architect Saman Kamal and the Iraqi sculptor and artist [[Ismail Fatah Al Turk]]. During the 1970s and 1980s, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government spent a lot of money on new monuments, which included the al-Shaheed Monument.&lt;ref name="Global Security"&gt;{{Cite web|title=GlobalSecurity.org|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/baghdad-monuments.htm|access-date=16 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225151850/https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/baghdad-monuments.htm#|archive-date=25 December 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative divisions==
{{see also|List of neighborhoods and districts in Baghdad}}
[[File:Bagdad-sat.JPG|thumb|Baghdad as seen from the [[International Space Station]]]]
Administratively, Baghdad Governorate is divided into [[Kaza|districts]] which are further divided into [[nahiyah|sub-districts]].  Municipally, the governorate is divided into 9 municipalities, which have responsibility for local issues.  Regional services, however, are coordinated and carried out by a mayor who oversees the municipalities.  There is no single [[city council]] that singularly governs Baghdad at a municipal level.  The governorate council is responsible for the governorate-wide policy.

These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centres for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function. Beginning in April 2003, the U.S. controlled [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these. The process initially focused on the election of neighbourhood councils in the official neighbourhoods, elected by neighbourhood caucuses.

The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighbourhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbours to subsequent meetings. Each neighbourhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighbourhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbours to vote for them.

Once all 88 (later increased to 89) neighbourhood councils were in place, each neighbourhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighbourhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighbourhood's population. The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighbourhood, through the district, and up to the city council.

The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself. There, local councils were elected from 20 neighbourhoods (Nahia) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (Qada). As within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council.

The first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected.

This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome; however, Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighbourhood councils, each council represents an average of 75,000 people.

The nine District Advisory Councils (DAC) are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New troops to move into Iraq |url=http://images.usatoday.com/news/graphics/troop_surge/flash.swf |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The city is located on a vast plain bisected by the [[Tigris]] river. The Tigris splits Baghdad in half, with the eastern half being called "[[Al-Rusafa, Iraq|Risafa]]" and the Western half known as "[[Karkh]]". The land on which the city is built is almost entirely flat and low-lying, being of [[alluvium|alluvial]] origin due to the periodic large floods which have occurred on the river.

{{wide image|Tigris River in Baghdad (2016).jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of the Tigris as it flows through Baghdad}}

===Climate===
Baghdad has a subtropical [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), featuring extremely hot, dry summers and mild, damp winters. In the summer, from June through August, the average maximum temperature is as high as {{convert|44|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, accompanied by blazing sunshine. Rainfall has, in fact, been recorded on fewer than half a dozen occasions at this time of year and has never exceeded {{convert|1|mm|in|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120711043252/http://climexp.knmi.nl/data/pa40650_yr.txt Monthly rainfall for Baghdad (WMO #40650)]&lt;/ref&gt; Even at night temperatures in summer are seldom below {{convert|24|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Baghdad's record highest temperature of 124 degrees Fahrenheit (51 degrees Celsius) was reached in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/weather/iranian-city-just-hit-world-record-temps-that-feel-like-163-degrees/ar-BBlh7k7] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802172014/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/weather/iranian-city-just-hit-world-record-temps-that-feel-like-163-degrees/ar-BBlh7k7# |date=2 August 2015 }} Accessed 31 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[humidity]] is typically under 50% in summer due to Baghdad's distance from the marshy southern Iraq and the coasts of [[Persian Gulf]], and [[dust storm]]s from the deserts to the west are a normal occurrence during the summer.

Winters boast temperatures typical of [[subtropics|subtropical climate]]s. From December through February, Baghdad has maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|15.5|to|18.5|C|F}}, though highs above {{convert|21|C|F}} are not unheard of. The average January low is {{convert|3.8|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but lows below freezing occur a couple of times per year on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=1464|title=World Weather Information Service|last=|first=|date=26 October 2016|website=worldweather.wmo.int|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027054505/http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=1464#|archive-date=27 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Baghdad's population was estimated at 7.22 million in 2015. The city historically had a predominantly [[Sunni]] population, but by the early 21st century around 82% of the city's population were [[Shia Islam in Iraq|Iraqi Shia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} At the beginning of the 21st century, some 1.5 million people migrated to Baghdad, most of them Shiites and a few Sunnis.

As early as 2003, about 20 percent of the population of the city was the result of mixed marriages between Shi'ites and Sunnis: they are often referred to as "Sushis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36528536# |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010175830/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36528536# |archive-date=10 October 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006–07)|sectarian violence in Iraq]] between the Sunni and Shia militia groups during the U.S. occupation of Iraq, the city's population became overwhelmingly Shia. Despite the government's promise to resettle Sunnis displaced by the violence, little has been done to bring this about. The [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|Iraqi Civil War following ISIS' invasion]] in 2014 caused hundreds of thousands of Iraqi internally displaced people to flee to the city. The city currently has Sunni, Shia, Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriacs, Armenians and mixed neighborhoods.

===Reconstruction efforts===
{{further information|Investment in post-invasion Iraq}}

Most [[Reconstruction of Iraq|Iraqi reconstruction]] efforts have been devoted to the restoration and repair of badly damaged urban infrastructure. More visible efforts at reconstruction through private development, like architect and urban designer [[Hisham N. Ashkouri]]'s [[Reconstruction of Iraq#The Proposed Baghdad Baghdad is mizz Renaissance Plan|Baghdad Renaissance Plan]] and the [[Sindbad Hotel Complex and Conference Center]] have also been made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcadd.com/baghdad-cbd.htm ARCADD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220055610/http://www.arcadd.com/baghdad-cbd.htm |date=20 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A plan was proposed by a Government agency to rebuild a tourist island in 2008.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/world/middleeast/21tourism.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fT%2fTravel%20and%20Vacations&amp;_r=0|title=The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=5 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006120152/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/world/middleeast/21tourism.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fT%2fTravel%20and%20Vacations&amp;_r=0#|archive-date=6 October 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2009, a construction plan was proposed to rebuild the heart of Baghdad, but the plan was never realized because corruption was involved in it.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/world/middleeast/30baghdad.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=5 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006200141/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/world/middleeast/30baghdad.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0#|archive-date=6 October 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baghdad Eye, a {{Convert|198|m|ft|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} tall [[Ferris wheel]], was proposed for Baghdad in August 2008.

Iraq's Tourism Board is also seeking investors to develop a "romantic" island on the River Tigris in Baghdad that was once a popular honeymoon spot for newlywed Iraqis. The project would include a six-star hotel, spa, an 18-hole golf course and a country club. In addition, the go-ahead has been given to build numerous architecturally unique skyscrapers along the Tigris that would develop the city's financial centre in Kadhehemiah.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com/id/26425911"/&gt;

In October 2008, the [[Baghdad Metro]] resumed service. It connects the center to the southern neighborhood of [[Dora, Baghdad|Dora]].
In May 2010, a new residential and commercial project nicknamed Baghdad Gate was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baghdad Gate|url=http://www.iraqinews.com/business-iraqi-dinar/baghdad-gate-housing-project-provides-job-opportunities-%E2%80%93-pm/|work=Baghdad Gate|publisher=Iraqi News|accessdate=24 May 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DevrHC6d?url=http://www.iraqinews.com/business-iraqi-dinar/baghdad-gate-housing-project-provides-job-opportunities-%E2%80%93-pm/#|archive-date=14 January 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project not only addresses the urgent need for new residential units in Baghdad but also acts as a real symbol of progress in the war torn city, as Baghdad has not seen projects of this scale for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baghdadgov.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178:baghdad-investment-createing-of-1824-housing-units-in-baghdad&amp;catid=25:the-project&amp;Itemid=95 |title=Baghdad Investment: Creating (1824) housing units in Baghdad. |work=Baghdad Governorate Website |year=2010 |accessdate=9 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323164726/http://www.baghdadgov.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178:baghdad-investment-createing-of-1824-housing-units-in-baghdad&amp;catid=25:the-project&amp;Itemid=95# |archive-date=23 March 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{See also|Baghdad Arabic|Culture of Iraq}}
[[File:Iraqi National Orchestra.jpg|thumb|The [[Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra]], officially founded in 1959, performing a concert in [[Iraq]] in July 2007.]]

Baghdad has always played a significant role in the broader [[Arab culture|Arab cultural sphere]], contributing several significant writers, musicians and visual artists. Famous [[Arab]] poets and singers such as [[Nizar Qabbani]], [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Fairuz]], [[Salah Al-Hamdani]], [[Ilham al-Madfai]] and others have performed for the city.

The dialect of [[Baghdad Arabic|Arabic spoken in Baghdad]] today differs from that of other large urban centres in Iraq, having features more characteristic of nomadic Arabic dialects (Versteegh, ''The Arabic Language''). It is possible that this was caused by the repopulating of the city with rural residents after the multiple sackings of the late [[Middle Ages]].

For poetry written about Baghdad, see [[Reuven Snir]] (ed.), ''Baghdad: The City in Verse'' (Harvard, 2013)[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/baghdad/]

Baghdad joined the [[Creative Cities Network|UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] as a City of Literature in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iinanews.org/page/public/news_details.aspx?id=138171&amp;NL=True|title=Baghdad selected as new member of ‘UNESCO Creative Cities Network’|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===

[[File:Baghdad Convention Center inside.jpg|thumb|right|Many events are hosted at the Baghdad Convention Center]]
Some of the important cultural institutions in the city include the [[National Theater (Iraq)|National Theater]], which was looted during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], but efforts are underway to restore the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csmonitor.com/2003/0716/p01s04b-woiq.htm Five women confront a new Iraq | csmonitor.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828071929/http://csmonitor.com/2003/0716/p01s04b-woiq.htm |date=28 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The live theatre scene received a boost during the 1990s, when UN [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theatres were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of [[Comedy|comedies]] and dramatic productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0102-04.htm |title=In Baghdad, Art Thrives As War Hovers |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=2 January 2003 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627162352/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0102-04.htm |archivedate=27 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include [[The Music and Ballet School of Baghdad]] and the Institute of Fine Arts Baghdad. The [[Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra]] is a government funded symphony orchestra in Baghdad. The INSO plays primarily classical European music, as well as original compositions based on Iraqi and Arab instruments and music. Baghdad is also home to a number of museums which housed [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and relics of [[ancient civilization]]; many of these were stolen, and the museums looted, during the widespread chaos immediately after United States forces entered the city. 

During the [[History of Iraq (2003–11)|2003 occupation of Iraq]], [[AFN Iraq]] ("Freedom Radio") broadcast news and entertainment within Baghdad, among other locations. There is also a private radio station called "Dijlah" (named after the Arabic word for the Tigris River) that was created in 2004 as Iraq's first independent talk radio station. Radio Dijlah offices, in the [[Jamia]] neighborhood of Baghdad, have been attacked on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dinarrvnews.net/gunmen-iraq-media-attacked/ |title=Gunmen storm independent radio station in latest attack against media in Iraq |work=International Herald Tribune |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010060435/http://dinarrvnews.net/gunmen-iraq-media-attacked/# |archive-date=10 October 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction of cultural heritage===
Priceless collection of artifacts in the [[National Museum of Iraq]] was looted during the 2003 US-led invasion. Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the [[Iraq National Library and Archive|National Library]] were destroyed under [[Saddam]]'s command and because of neglect by the occupying coalition forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/634kfc.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004110213/https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/634kfc.htm# |archive-date=4 October 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
Baghdad is home to some of the most successful [[Association football|football (soccer)]] teams in Iraq, the biggest being [[Al-Shorta SC|Al-Shorta]] (Police), [[Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya]] (Airforce club), [[Al-Zawra'a SC|Al-Zawra'a]], and [[Talaba SC|Talaba]] (Students). The largest stadium in Baghdad is [[Al-Shaab Stadium]], which was opened in 1966. Another, but much larger stadium, is still in the opening stages of construction.

The city has also had a strong tradition of [[horse racing]] ever since [[World War I]], known to Baghdadis simply as 'Races'. There are reports of pressures by the Islamists to stop this tradition due to the associated gambling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=IBP, Inc|title=Iraq Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|date=2012|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781438774633|pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2196">The '''[[baguette]]''' is a small, compact [[handbag]] designed by [[Fendi]] in 1997. Made popular by its exposure on [[Sex and the City]], the designer handbag was very popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, often cited as the first [[It Bag|"It" bag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/advice/a7158/fendi-baguette/|title=History of an It Bag|author=Joyce Corrigan|work=Marie Claire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baguette concept was for a small, streamlined bag, carried on a short strap, that could be adapted for different looks, colors and textures while still having a consistent aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/b0431e00-9601-11e1-a6a0-00144feab49a.html#axzz3r6COz7OS|title=The first ‘it’ bag|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marked a contrast from many popular women's purses at the time, which were often large totes.

Still relatively small and little-known, the Fendi Italian fashion brand agreed to lend the Baguette to HBO's ''Sex and the City'', which was still a relatively new show that was fast growing in popularity. [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] has credited Fendi's loan of the bag with being central in establishing the show and her character [[Carrie Bradshaw]], saying "Having Carrie wear the Baguette was a defining moment for us, and marked the beginning of everything. The timing was perfect for the story we were telling and the character I was playing; the Baguette was the perfect embellishment. Once Fendi loaned us items, everyone was more willing to do so, which helped us dramatically in conveying Carrie’s decadence."&lt;ref&gt;Achille Bonito Oliva et. al., ''The Fendi Baguette Book'', New York: Rizzoli Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the bag was already growing in popularity, its prominence on the show led to the bag's extreme popularity, as well as helping to establish SATC as a fashion-oriented show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2145000/Sarah-Jessica-Parker-Fendi-Baguette-Sex-City-fashion.html|title=Sarah Jessica Parker: Fendi Baguette made Sex and the City a show about fashion - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline== 
For the purposes of this summary, it is convenient to divide the chronology of the universe since it [[Cosmogony|originated]], into five parts. It is generally considered meaningless or unclear whether [[time]] existed before this chronology:&lt;!--merely based on the de facto article toc, not binding in any way and can be rearranged along with article structure--&gt;

:'''1. The [[#Very early universe|very early universe]]''' – the first [[picosecond]]&amp;nbsp;(10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) of cosmic time. It includes the [[Planck epoch]], during which currently understood [[laws of physics]] may not apply; the emergence in stages of the four known [[fundamental interaction]]s or [[force]]s – first [[gravity]], and later the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] interactions; and the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] and [[supercooling]] of the  still immensely hot universe due to [[cosmic inflation]], which is believed to have been triggered by the separation of the [[Strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]].

:Tiny ripples in the universe at this stage are believed to be the basis of large-scale structures that formed much later. Different stages of the very early universe are understood to different extents.  The earlier parts are beyond the grasp of practical experiments in [[particle physics]] but can be explored through other means.

:'''2. The [[#Early universe|early universe]]''', lasting around 377,000 years. Initially, various kinds of [[subatomic particle]]s are formed in stages. These particles include almost equal amounts of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], so most of it quickly annihilates, leaving a small excess of matter in the universe.

:At about one second,  [[Neutrino decoupling|neutrinos decouple]]; these neutrinos form the [[cosmic neutrino background]]. If [[primordial black hole]]s exist, they are also  formed at about one second of cosmic time.  [[Composite particle|Composite]] [[subatomic particle]]s emerge – including [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s – and from about 3 minutes, conditions are suitable for [[nucleosynthesis]]: around 25% of the protons and all the neutrons  [[nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[big bang nucleosynthesis|into heavier elements]], mainly [[helium-4]].

:By 20 minutes, the universe is no longer hot enough for fusion, but far too hot for neutral [[atom]]s to exist or [[photon]]s to travel far. It is therefore an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. At around 47,000 years,&lt;ref name="ryden"&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33, 6.41&lt;/ref&gt; as the universe cools, its behavior begins to be dominated by [[matter]] rather than radiation.

:At about 377,000 years {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, the universe finally becomes cool enough for neutral [[atom]]s to form ("[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]"), and as a result it also became [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] for the first time. The newly formed atoms – mainly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] with traces of [[lithium]] – quickly reach their lowest energy state ([[ground state]]) by releasing photons ("[[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]"), and these photons can still be detected today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). This is currently the oldest observation we have of the universe.

:'''3. Dark Ages and large-scale [[structure formation|structure emergence]]''', from 377,000 years until about 1 billion years. After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent but the clouds of [[hydrogen]] only collapsed very slowly to form [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], so there were no new sources of light. The only photons (electromagnetic radiation, or "light") in the universe were those released during decoupling (visible today as the [[cosmic microwave background]]) and [[hydrogen line|21 cm radio emissions]] occasionally emitted by hydrogen atoms. The decoupled photons would have filled the universe with a brilliant pale orange glow at first, gradually [[redshift]]ing to non-visible [[wavelength]]s after about 3 million years, leaving it without visible light. This period is known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]].

:Between about 10 and 17 million years the universe's average temperature was suitable for liquid water (273 – 373K) and there has been speculation whether rocky planets or indeed life could have arisen briefly, since statistically a tiny part of the universe could have had different conditions from the rest, and gained warmth from the universe as a whole.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October" /&gt;

:At some point around 400 to 700 million years, the earliest generations of [[stellar evolution|stars]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxies form]], and early large structures gradually emerge, drawn to the foam-like  [[dark matter]] [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] which have already begun to draw together throughout the universe. [[Population III star|The earliest generations of stars]] have not yet been observed astronomically. They may have been huge and [[metallicity|non-metallic]] with very short lifetimes compared to [[Main Sequence|most stars we see today]], so they commonly finish burning their [[hydrogen]] fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years. Other theories suggest that they may have included small stars, some perhaps still burning today. In either case, these early generations of supernovae created most of the everyday [[chemical element|elements]] we see around us today, and seeded the universe with them.

:[[Galaxy cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s emerge over time. At some point, high energy photons from the earliest stars, [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and perhaps [[quasar]]s led to a period of [[reionization]]. The universe gradually transitioned into the universe we see around us today, and the Dark Ages only fully came to an end at about 1 billion years.

:'''4. The universe as it appears today'''. From 1 billion years, and for about 12.8 billions of years, the universe has looked much as it does today. It will continue to appear very similar for many billions of years into the future. The [[thin disk]] of [[Milky Way|our galaxy]] began to form at about 5 billion years (8.8 bn years ago),&lt;ref name=Peloso&gt;{{cite journal |last1=del Peloso |first1=E. F. |last2=da Silva |first2=L. |last3=Porto de Mello |first3=G. F. |last4=Arany-Prado |first4=L. I. |title=The age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eunucleocosmochronology. III.

:From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the slowing expansion of space gradually begins to accelerate under the influence of [[dark energy]], which may be a [[scalar field]] throughout our universe. The present-day universe is understood quite well, but beyond about 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years in the future), uncertainties in current knowledge mean that we are less sure which path our universe will take.

:'''5. [[Fate of the universe|The far future]]'''. At some time the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end as stars are no longer being born, and the expansion of the universe will mean that the observable universe becomes limited to local galaxies. There are various scenarios for the far future and [[ultimate fate of the universe]]. More exact knowledge of our current universe will allow these to be better understood.

Earliest stages of chronology shown below (before neutrino decoupling) are an active area of research and based on ideas which are still speculative and subject to modification as scientific knowledge improves.

"Time" column is based on extrapolation of observed [[metric expansion of space]] back in the past. For the earliest stages of chronology this extrapolation may be invalid. To give one example, [[eternal inflation]] theories propose that inflation lasts forever throughout most of the universe, making the notion of "N seconds since Big Bang" ill-defined.

The radiation temperature refers to the [[cosmic background radiation]] and is given by 2.725·(1+''z''), where ''z'' is the [[redshift]].

==Very early universe {{anchor|Very early universe}}==

===Planck epoch===
:''Times shorter than 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ([[Planck time]])''
{{Main|Planck epoch}}

The [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck Epoch|Planck epoch]] is an era in traditional (non-inflationary) [[Big Bang|Big Bang cosmology]] immediately after the event which began our known universe. During this epoch, the temperature and average energies within the universe were so inconceivably high compared to any temperature we can observe today, that everyday subatomic particles could not form, and even the four fundamental forces that shape our universe—[[electromagnetism]], [[gravitation]], [[weak interaction|weak nuclear interaction]], and [[strong interaction|strong nuclear interaction]]—were combined and formed one fundamental force. Little is understood about physics at this temperature; different hypotheses propose different scenarios. Traditional big bang cosmology predicts a [[gravitational singularity]] before this time, but this theory relies on the theory of [[general relativity]], which is thought to break down for this epoch due to [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]].

In inflationary models of cosmology, times before the end of inflation (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang) do not follow the same timeline as in traditional big bang cosmology. Models that aim to describe the universe and physics during the Planck epoch are generally speculative and fall under the umbrella of "[[New Physics]]". Examples include the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]],  [[string gas cosmology]], and the [[ekpyrotic universe]].

===Grand unification epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ryden B: "Introduction to Cosmology", p. 196 Addison-Wesley 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Grand unification epoch}}

As the universe [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] and cooled, it crossed transition temperatures at which forces separated from each other. These [[phase transition]]s can be visualised as similar to [[condensation]] and [[freezing]] phase transitions of ordinary matter. At certain temperatures/energies, water molecules change their behaviour and structure, and they will behave completely differently. Like steam turning to water, the [[field (physics)|fields]] which define our universe's fundamental forces and particles also completely change their behaviors and structures when the temperature/energy falls below a certain point. This is not apparent in everyday life, because it only happens at much, much, higher temperatures than we usually see in our present universe.

These phase transitions are believed to be caused by a phenomenon of [[quantum field]]s called "[[symmetry breaking]]".

In everyday terms, as the universe cools, it becomes possible for the quantum fields that create the forces and particles around us, to settle at lower energy levels and with higher levels of stability. In doing so, they completely shift how they interact. Forces and interactions arise due to these fields, so the universe can behave very differently above and below a phase transition. For example, in a later epoch, a side effect of one phase transition is that suddenly, many particles that had no mass at all acquire a mass (they begin to interact with the [[Higgs boson]]), and a single  force begins to manifest as two separate forces.

The grand unification epoch began with a phase transitions of this kind, when gravitation separated from the universal combined [[gauge theory|gauge force]]. This caused two forces to now exist: gravity, and an  [[electrostrong interaction]]. There is no hard evidence yet, that such a combined force existed, but many physicists believe it did. The physics of this electrostrong interaction would be described by a so-called [[grand unified theory]] (GUT).

The grand unification epoch ended with a second phase transition, as the electrostrong interaction in turn separated, and began to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong force|strong]] and [[electroweak force|electroweak]] interactions.

===Electroweak epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds (or the end of inflation) and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
{{Main|Electroweak epoch}}

Depending on how epochs are defined, and the model being followed, the [[electroweak epoch]] may be considered to start before or after the inflationary epoch. In some models it is described as including the inflationary epoch. In other models, the electroweak epoch is said to begin after the inflationary epoch ended, at roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

According to traditional big bang cosmology, the electroweak epoch began 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, when the temperature of the universe was low enough (10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; K) for the [[Grand Unified Theory|Electronuclear Force]] to begin to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong interaction|strong]] and the [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] interactions. (The electroweak interaction will also separate later, dividing into the [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] interactions). The exact point where electrostrong symmetry was broken is not certain, because of the very high energies of this event.

===Inflationary epoch and the rapid expansion of space===
:''Before ca.  10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Inflationary epoch|Expansion of space}}
At this point, the very early universe [[expansion of space|suddenly and very rapidly expanded]] to at least 10&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt; times its previous volume (and possibly much more). This is equivalent to a linear increase of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; times in every spatial dimension – equivalent to an object 1 [[nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Meter|m]], about half the width of a [[molecule]] of [[DNA]]) in length, expanding to one approximately 10.6 [[light years]] (about 62 trillion miles) long in a tiny fraction of a second. This change is known as [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]].

Although light and objects within [[spacetime]] cannot travel faster than the [[speed of light]], in this case it was the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] governing the size and geometry of [[spacetime]] itself that changed in scale. Changes to the metric are not limited by the speed of light.

In some models, it is thought to have been triggered by the [[phase transition|separation]] of the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]]s which ended the [[grand unification epoch]]. One of the theoretical products of this phase transition was a [[scalar field]] called the [[inflaton]] field. As this field settled into its lowest energy state throughout the universe, it generated an enormous repulsive force that led to a rapid expansion of space itself. Inflation explains several observed properties of the current universe that are otherwise difficult to account for, including explaining how today's universe has ended up so exceedingly [[homogeneous]] (similar) on a very large scale, even though it was highly disordered in its earliest stages.

It is not known exactly when the inflationary epoch ended, but it is thought to have been between 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang.  The rapid expansion of space meant that elementary particles remaining from the grand unification epoch were now distributed very thinly across the universe. However, the huge potential energy of the inflation field was released at the end of the inflationary epoch, as the inflaton field decayed into other particles, known as "reheating". This heating effect led to the universe being repopulated with a dense, hot mixture of [[quark–gluon plasma|quarks, anti-quarks and gluons]]. In other models, reheating is often considered to mark the start of the [[electroweak epoch]], and some  theories, such as [[warm inflation]], avoid a reheating phase entirely.

In non-traditional versions of Big Bang theory  (known as "inflationary" models), inflation ended at a temperature corresponding to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang, but this does ''not'' imply that the inflationary era lasted less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. To explain the observed homogeneity of the universe, the duration in these models must be longer than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. Therefore, in inflationary cosmology, the earliest meaningful time "after the Big Bang" is the time of the ''end'' of inflation. 

After inflation ended, the universe continued to expand, but at a very slow rate. The slow expansion began to speed up after several billion years, believed to be due to [[dark energy]], and is still expanding today.

On March 17, 2014, astrophysicists of the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] collaboration announced the detection of inflationary [[gravitational waves]] in the [[B-modes|B-mode]] [[power spectrum]] which was interpreted as clear experimental evidence for the [[Inflation (cosmology)|theory of inflation]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317B"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Space Ripples Reveal Big Bang’s Smoking Gun |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date=March 17, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140324"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Ripples From the Big Bang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/science/space/ripples-from-the-big-bang.html |date=March 24, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6865|work=BICEP2 News|title=Not Even Wrong|date=13 May 2014|first=Peter|last=Woit|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 19, 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the [[cosmic inflation]] findings was reported &lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ade, P.

===Electroweak symmetry breaking ===
:''10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Electroweak symmetry breaking}}

As the universe's temperature continued to fall below a certain very high energy level, a third [[symmetry breaking]] occurs. So far as we currently know, it was the final symmetry breaking event in the formation of our universe. It is believed that below some energies unknown yet&lt;!-- IF THIS IS CHANGED, PLEASE ALSO UPDATE THE SAME INFO AT [[Electroweak interaction ]], [[Electroweak scale]], [[Electroweak epoch]]. THANK YOU. --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;The particular number 246 GeV is taken to be the [[vacuum expectation value]] &lt;math&gt;v = (G_F \sqrt{2})^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Higgs field]] (where &lt;math&gt;G_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi coupling constant]]), it's not the symmetry breaking energy scale.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=March 2018}} the [[Higgs field]] spontaneously acquires a [[vacuum expectation value]]. When this happens, it [[electroweak symmetry breaking|breaks electroweak gauge symmetry]]. This has two related effects:

# Via the [[Higgs mechanism]], all [[elementary particle]]s interacting with the Higgs field become massive, having been massless at higher energy levels.
# As a side-effect, the [[weak force]] and [[electromagnetic force]], and their respective [[boson]]s (the [[W and Z bosons]] and [[photon]]) now begin to manifest differently in the present universe. Before electroweak symmetry breaking these bosons were all massless particles and interacted over long distances, but at this point the W and Z bosons abruptly become massive particles only interacting over distances smaller than the size of an atom, while the photon remains massless and remains a long-distance interaction.

After electroweak symmetry breaking, the [[fundamental interactions]] we know of – [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] – have all taken their present forms, and fundamental particles have mass, but the temperature of the universe is still too high to allow the formation of many fundamental particles we now see in the universe.

===Supersymmetry breaking (speculative)===
{{Main|Supersymmetry breaking}}

If [[supersymmetry]] is a property of our universe, then it must be broken at an energy that is no lower than 1 [[TeV]], the electroweak scale. The masses of particles and their [[superpartner]]s would then no longer be equal.  This very high energy could explain why no superpartners of known particles have ever been observed.

==Early universe{{anchor|Early universe}}==

After cosmic inflation ends, the universe is filled with a hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], the remains of reheating. From this point onwards the physics of the early universe is much better understood, and the energies involved in the [[Quark epoch]] are directly amenable to [[particle physics|experiment]].

===The quark epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Quark epoch}}

The [[quark epoch]] began approximately [[Picosecond|10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds]] after the [[Big Bang]]. This was the period in the evolution of the early universe immediately after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]], when the [[fundamental interaction]]s of [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] had taken their present forms, but the temperature of the universe was still too high to allow [[quark]]s to bind together to form [[hadron]]s.

During the quark epoch the universe was filled with a dense, hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], containing quarks, [[lepton]]s and their [[antiparticle]]s. Collisions between particles were too energetic to allow quarks to combine into [[meson]]s or [[baryon]]s.

The quark epoch ended when the universe was about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds old, when the average energy of particle interactions had fallen below the [[binding energy]] of hadrons.

====Baryogenesis====
{{Main|Baryogenesis}}
{{further|Leptogenesis (physics)}}
''Perhaps by 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.''{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Baryon]]s are [[subatomic particle]]s such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, that are composed of three [[quark]]s. It would be expected that both baryons, and particles known as [[antimatter|antibaryons]] would have formed in equal numbers. However, this does not seem to be what happened – as far as we know, the universe was left with far more baryons than antibaryons. In fact, almost no antibaryons are observed in nature. It is not clear how this came about. Any explanation for this phenomenon must allow the [[Sakharov conditions]] related to baryogenesis to have been satisfied at some time after the end of [[cosmological inflation]]. Current [[particle physics]] suggests asymmetries under which these conditions would be met, but these asymmetries appear to be too small to account for the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the universe.

===Hadron epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; second and 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Hadron epoch}}

The quark–gluon plasma that composes the universe cools until [[hadron]]s, including baryons such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, can form.
Initially, hadron/anti-hadron pairs could form, so [[matter]] and [[anti-matter]] were in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, new hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced, and most of the newly formed hadrons and anti-hadrons [[annihilation|annihilated]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high-energy [[photon]]s. A comparatively small residue of hadrons remained at about 1 second of cosmic time, when this epoch ended. 

Theory predicts that about 1 neutron remained for every 7 protons. We believe this to be correct because, at a later stage, all the neutrons and some of the protons [[nuclear fusion|fused]], leaving [[hydrogen]], a hydrogen [[isotope]] called [[deuterium]], [[helium]] and other elements, which we can measure. A 1:7 ratio of hadrons at the end of this epoch would indeed produce the observed element ratios in the early as well as current universe.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Neutrino decoupling and cosmic neutrino background===
:''Around 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{main|Neutrino decoupling|Cosmic neutrino background}}

At approximately 1 second after the Big Bang [[neutrino]]s [[neutrino decoupling|decouple]] and begin traveling freely through space. As neutrinos rarely interact with matter, these neutrinos still exist today, analogous to the much later [[cosmic microwave background]] emitted during [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. The neutrinos from this event have a very low energy, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller than is possible with present-day direct detection.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/09/09/cosmic-neutrinos-detected-confirming-the-big-bangs-last-great-prediction Cosmic Neutrinos Detected, Confirming The Big Bang's Last Great Prediction] – ''[[Forbes]]'' coverage of original paper: {{cite journal |last1=Follin |first1=Brent |last2=Knox |first2=Lloyd |last3=Millea |first3=Marius |last4=Pan |first4=Zhen |title=First Detection of the Acoustic Oscillation Phase Shift Expected from the Cosmic Neutrino Background |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=26 August 2015 |volume=115 |issue=9 |pages=091301 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.091301|pmid=26371637 |arxiv=1503.07863 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115i1301F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even high energy neutrinos are [[neutrino detector|notoriously difficult to detect]], so this [[cosmic neutrino background]] (CNB) may not be directly observed in detail for many years, if at all.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

However, Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CNB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the cosmic neutrino background exists, both from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predictions of the helium abundance, and from anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]]. One of these predictions is that neutrinos will have left a subtle imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is well known that the CMB has irregularities. Some of the CMB fluctuations were roughly regularly spaced, because of the effect of [[baryon acoustic oscillations|baryonic acoustic oscillations]]. In theory, the decoupled neutrinos should have had a very slight effect on the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the various CMB fluctuations.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that such shifts had been detected in the CMB. Moreover, the fluctuations corresponded to neutrinos of almost exactly the temperature predicted by Big Bang theory ({{nowrap|1.96 +/-0.02K}} compared to a prediction of 1.95K), and exactly three types of neutrino, the same number of neutrino flavours currently predicted by the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

=== Possible formation of primordial black holes===
: ''May have occurred within about 1 second after the Big Bang''
[[Primordial black hole]]s are a hypothetical type of [[black hole]] proposed in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zel'dovitch &amp; Novikov|title=The Hypothesis of Cores Retarded During Expansion and the Hot Cosmological Model|journal=Astronomicheskii Zhurnal|date=14 March 1966|volume=10|issue=4|pages=602–603|bibcode=1966AZh....43..758Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may have formed during the so-called ''radiation dominated era'', due to the high densities and inhomogeneous conditions within the first second of cosmic time. Random fluctuations could lead to some regions becoming dense enough to undergo gravitational collapse, forming black holes. Current understandings and theories place tight limits on the abundance and mass of these objects.

Typically, primordial black hole formation requires density contrasts (regional variations in the Universe's density) of around &lt;math&gt; \delta \rho / \rho \sim 0.1 &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;(10%), where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the average density of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harada |first=T. |last2=Yoo |first2=C.-M. |last3=Khori |first3=K. |year=2013 |title=Threshold of primordial black hole formation |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=88 |issue=8 |pages=084051 |arxiv=1309.4201 |bibcode= 2013PhRvD..88h4051H|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.084051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mechanisms could produce dense regions meeting this criterion during the early universe, including reheating, cosmological phase transitions and (in so-called "hybrid inflation models") axion inflation. Since primordial black holes didn't form from stellar [[gravitational collapse]], their masses can be far below stellar mass (~2×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g). [[Stephen Hawking]] calculated in 1971 that primordial black holes could weigh as little as 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} But they can have any size, so they could also be large, and may have contributed to the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]].

===Lepton epoch===
:''Between 1 second and 10 seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Lepton epoch}}

The majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilate each other at the end of the hadron epoch, leaving [[lepton]]s (such as the [[electron]], [[muon]]s and certain [[neutrino]]s) and anti-leptons, dominating the mass of the universe. 

The lepton epoch follows a similar path to the earlier hadron epoch. Initially leptons and anti-leptons are produced in pairs. About 10 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe falls to the point at which new lepton/anti-lepton pairs are no longer created and most remaining leptons and anti-leptons quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high energy photons, and leaving a small residue of non-annihilated leptons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|title=The Timescale of Creation|website=Knowledge tree project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728123714/http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|archivedate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photon epoch===
:''Between 10 seconds and 377,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Photon epoch}}

After most leptons and anti-leptons are annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch, most of the mass-energy in the universe is left in the form of [[photon]]s. (Much of the rest of its mass-energy is in the form of [[neutrino]]s and other [[special relativity|relativistic]] particles{{cn|date=September 2018}}). Therefore the energy of the universe, and its overall behavior, is dominated by its [[photon]]s. These photons continue to interact frequently with charged protons, electrons and (eventually) [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. They continue to do so for about the next 377,000 years.

===Nucleosynthesis of light elements===
:''Between 2 minutes and 20 minutes after the Big Bang''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/BBNS.html|title=Detailed timeline of Big Bang nucleosynthesis processes|first=Edward L.|last=Wright|date=26 September 2012|website=astro.ucla.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}

Between about 2 and 20 minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and pressure of the universe allow [[nuclear fusion]] to occur, giving rise to nuclei of a few light [[chemical element|elements]] beyond hydrogen ("[[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]"). About 25% of the protons, and all&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; the neutrons fuse to form [[deuterium]], a hydrogen [[isotope]], and most of the deuterium quickly fuses to form [[helium-4]]. 

Atomic nuclei will easily unbind (break apart) above a certain temperature, related to their [[binding energy]]. From about 2 minutes, the falling temperature means that deuterium no longer unbinds, and is stable,  and starting from about 3 minutes, helium and other elements formed by the fusion of deuterium  also no longer unbind and are stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast162_10/notes44.html|first=Barbara|last=Ryden|date=12 March 2003|title=Astronomy 162 — Lecture 44: The first three minutes|website=astronomy.ohio-state.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short duration and falling temperature means that only the simplest and fastest fusion processes can occur. Only tiny amounts of nuclei beyond helium are formed, because [[nucleosynthesis]] of heavier elements is difficult and [[triple-alpha process|requires thousands of years]] even in stars.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HP/article/download/5186/4314|title=The foreground of big bang nucleosynthesis|first=Ravi|last=Karki|journal=The Himalayan Phisics|volume=1|issue=1|date=May 2010|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small amounts of [[tritium]] (another hydrogen isotope) and [[beryllium]]-7 and -8 are formed, but these are unstable and are quickly lost again.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; A small amount of deuterium is left unfused because of the very short duration.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"/&gt;

Therefore, the only stable nuclides created by the end of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] are protium (single proton/hydrogen nucleus), deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.4156 |title = Revised Big Bang Nucleosynthesis with long-lived negatively charged massive particles: Impact of new 6Li limits, primordial 9Be nucleosynthesis, and updated recombination rates |journal = The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume = 214 |issue = 1 |pages = 5 |last1=Kusakabe |first1=Motohiko |display-authors=etal |year = 2014|doi = 10.1088/0067-0049/214/1/5 |bibcode = 2014ApJS..214....5K }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mass, the resulting matter is about 75% hydrogen nuclei, 25% helium nuclei, and perhaps 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; by mass of [[Lithium-7]]. The next most common stable isotopes produced are [[lithium-6]], [[beryllium-9]], [[boron-11]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] ("CNO"), but these have predicted abundances of between 5 and 30 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; by mass, making them essentially undetectable and negligible.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/665/1/012001|title = Primordial Nucleosynthesis|journal = Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume = 665|issue = 10102|pages = 012001|year = 2017|last1 = Coc|first1 = A|arxiv = 1609.06048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.6694 |title = Standard big bang nucleosynthesis and primordial CNO Abundances after Planck|journal = Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics |volume = 2014|issue = 10|pages = 050|doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2014/10/050|year = 2014|last1 = Coc|first1 = Alain|last2 = Uzan|first2 = Jean-Philippe|last3 = Vangioni|first3 = Elisabeth|bibcode = 2014JCAP...10..050C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amounts of each light element in the early universe can be estimated from old galaxies, and is strong evidence for the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; For example, the Big Bang should produce about 1 neutron for every 7 protons, allowing for 25% of all nucleons to be fused into helium-4 (2 protons and 2 neutrons out of every 16 nucleons), and this is the amount we find today, and far more than can be easily explained by other processes.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Similarly, deuterium fuses extremely easily; any alternative explanation must also explain how conditions existed for deuterium to form, but also left some of that deuterium unfused and not immediately fused again into helium.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Any alternative must also explain the proportions of the various light elements and their isotopes. A few isotopes, such as lithium-7, were found to be present in amounts that differed from theory, but over time, these differences have been resolved by better observations.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Matter domination===
:''47,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{main|Matter-dominated era}}
Until now, the universe's large scale dynamics and behavior have been determined mainly by radiation – meaning, those constituents that move [[special relativity|relativistically]] (at or near the [[speed of light]]), such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; As the universe cools, from around 47,000 years (z=3600),&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large scale behavior becomes dominated by [[matter]] instead. This occurs because the energy density of matter begins to exceed both the energy density of radiation  and the vacuum energy density.&lt;ref&gt;Zelik, M and Gregory, S: "Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", page 497. Thompson Learning, Inc. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Around or shortly after this time,{{when|date=April 2018}} the densities of non-relativistic matter (atomic nuclei) and relativistic radiation (photons) become equal, the [[Jeans length]], which determines the smallest structures that can form (due to competition between gravitational attraction and pressure effects), begins to fall and perturbations, instead of being wiped out by [[free-streaming]] [[radiation]], can begin to grow in amplitude.

According to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], by this stage, the [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. (However the total matter in the universe is only 31.7%, much smaller than the 68.3% of [[dark energy]]). There is overwhelming evidence that [[dark matter]] exists and dominates our universe, but since the exact nature of dark matter is still not understood, Big Bang theory does not presently cover any stages in its formation.

From this point on, and for several billion years to come, the presence of dark matter accelerates the [[structure formation|formation of structure]] in our universe. In the early universe, dark matter gradually gathers in huge filaments under the effects of [[gravity]]. This amplifies the tiny inhomogeneities (irregularities) in the density of the universe which was left by cosmic inflation. Over time, slightly denser regions become denser and slightly rarefied (emptier) regions become more rarefied. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter.

About 377,000 years after the Big Bang, two connected events occurred: [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Recombination describes the ionized particles combining to form the first  neutral [[atom]]s, and decoupling refers to the [[photon]]s released ("decoupled") as the newly formed atoms settle into more stable energy states.

Just before recombination, the [[baryonic matter]] in the universe was at a temperature where it formed a hot [[plasma (physics)|ionized plasma]]. Most of the photons in the universe interacted with electrons and protons, and could not travel significant distances without interacting with ionized particles. As a result, the universe was opaque or "foggy". Although there was light, it was not possible to see, nor can we observe that light through telescopes.

At around 377,000 years, the universe has cooled to a point where free [[electron]]s can combine with the [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to form neutral atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results | first=G. | last=Hinshaw | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement | volume=180 | issue=2| pages=225–245 | year=2009 | url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/pub_papers/fiveyear/basic_results/wmap5basic.pdf |format=PDF| doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 | arxiv=0803.0732 | bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is relatively fast (and faster for the helium than for the hydrogen), and is known as [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukhanov, V: "Physical foundations of Cosmology", p. 120, Cambridge 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The name is slightly inaccurate and is given for historical reasons: in fact the electrons and atomic nuclei were combining for the first time.

Directly combining in a low energy state ([[ground state]]) is less efficient, so these hydrogen atoms generally form with the electrons still in a high energy state, and once combined, the electrons quickly release energy in the form of one or more [[photon]]s as they transition to a low energy state. This release of photons is known as [[Decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Some of these decoupled photons are captured by other hydrogen atoms, the remainder remain free. By the end of recombination, most of the protons in the universe have formed neutral atoms. This change from charged to neutral particles means that the [[mean free path]] photons can travel before capture in effect becomes infinite, so any decoupled photons that have not been captured can travel freely over long distances (see [[Thomson scattering]]). The universe has become transparent to visible [[light]], [[radio wave]]s and other [[electromagnetic radiation]] for the first time in its history.

| The background of this box approximates the original [[Color temperature|4000K color]] of the photons released during decoupling, before they became [[redshift]]ed to form the [[cosmic microwave background]].

|}
The photons released by these newly formed hydrogen atoms initially had a [[Color temperature|temperature/energy of around ~ 4000&amp;nbsp;K]]. This would have been visible to the eye as a pale yellow/orange tinted, or "soft", white color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediacollege.com/lighting/colour/colour-temperature.html|title=Color temperature chart|website=Media college|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over billions of years since decoupling, as the universe has expanded, the photons have been [[red-shift]]ed from visible light to radio waves (microwave radiation corresponding to a temperature of about 2.7&amp;nbsp;K). Red shifting describes the photons acquiring longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency|frequencies]] as the [[metric expansion of space|universe expanded over billions of years]], so that they gradually changed from visible light to radio waves. These same photons can still be detected as radio waves today. They form the [[cosmic microwave background]] ("CMB"), and they provide crucial evidence of the early universe and how it developed.

Around the same time as recombination, existing [[pressure wave]]s within the electron-baryon [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] – known as [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] – became embedded in the distribution of matter as it condensed, giving rise to a very slight preference in distribution of large-scale objects. Therefore, the cosmic microwave background is a picture of the universe at the end of this epoch including the tiny fluctuations generated during [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] (see diagram), and the spread of objects such as galaxies in the universe is an indication of the scale and size of the universe as it developed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|title=Quasars illustrate dark energy's roller coaster ride|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20303592|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dark Ages ===
&lt;!--Note: This section is directly linked to by [[Graphical timeline from Big Bang to Heat Death]]. Update that link if changing the anchor in the section title.--&gt;
{{see also|21 centimeter radiation}}
After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent and had cooled enough to allow light to travel long distances, but there were no light-producing structures such as [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Stars and galaxies are formed when dense regions of gas form due to the action of [[gravity]], and this takes a long time within a near-uniform density of gas and on the scale required, so it is estimated that stars did not exist for perhaps hundreds of millions of years after recombination.

This period, known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]], began around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. During the Dark Ages, the temperature of the universe cooled from some 4000&amp;nbsp;K down to about 60&amp;nbsp;K, and only two sources of photons existed: the photons released during recombination/decoupling (as neutral hydrogen atoms formed), which we can still detect today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), and photons occasionally released by neutral hydrogen atoms, known as the [[hydrogen line|21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line of neutral hydrogen]]. The hydrogen spin line is in the microwave range of frequencies, and within 3 million years,{{cn|date=October 2018}} the CMB photons had [[redshift]]ed out of visible light to [[infrared]]; from that time until the first stars, there were no visible light photons. Other than perhaps some rare statistical anomalies, the universe was truly dark.

The October 2010 discovery of [[UDFy-38135539]], the first observed galaxy to have existed during the following [[reionization]] epoch, gives us a window into these times. The galaxy earliest in this period observed and thus also the most distant galaxy ever observed is currently on the record of Leiden University's Richard J. Bouwens and Garth D. Illingsworth from UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. They found the galaxy [[UDFj-39546284]] to be at a time some 480 million years after the Big Bang or about halfway through the Cosmic Dark Ages at a distance of about 13.2 billion [[light-years]]. More recently, the [[UDFy-38135539]], [[EGSY8p7]] and [[GN-z11]] galaxies were found to be around 380–550 million years after the Big Bang and at a distance of around 13.4 billion light-years.&lt;ref name="Space-20121212"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Ancient Galaxy May Be Most Distant Ever Seen|url=http://www.space.com/18879-hubble-most-distant-galaxy.html |date=December 12, 2012|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=December 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also currently an [[LOFAR|observational effort]] underway to detect the faint 21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line radiation, as it is in principle an even more powerful tool than the cosmic microwave background for studying the early universe.

Structures may have begun to emerge from around 150 million years, and stars and early galaxies gradually emerged from around 400 to 700 million years. As they emerged, the Dark Ages gradually ended. Because this process was gradual, the Dark Ages only fully ended around 1 billion (1000 million) years, as the universe took its present appearance.

====Speculative "habitable epoch"====
:''ca. 10–17 million years after the Big Bang''

For about 6.6 million years, between about 10 to 17 million years after the Big Bang (redshift 137–100), the background temperature was between 373&amp;nbsp;K and 273&amp;nbsp;K, a temperature compatible with [[liquid water]] and common [[biological]] [[chemical reactions]]. [[Avi Loeb|Loeb]] (2014) speculated that [[Abiogenesis|primitive life]] might in principle have appeared during this window, which he called "the Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe".&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9371049&amp;fileId=S1473550414000196 |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|arxiv = 1312.0613 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARXIV-20131202"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |arxiv=1312.0613 |date=December 2013|bibcode = 2014IJAsB..13..337L |doi = 10.1017/S1473550414000196 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb argues that carbon-based life might have evolved in a hypothetical pocket of the early universe that was dense enough both to generate at least one massive star that subsequently releases carbon in a supernova, and that was also dense enough to generate a planet. (Such dense pockets, if they existed, would have been extremely rare.) Life would also have required a heat differential, rather than just uniform background radiation; this could be provided by naturally-occurring geothermal energy. Such life would likely have remained primitive; it is highly unlikely that intelligent life would have had sufficient time to evolve before the hypothetical oceans freeze over at the end of the habitable epoch.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Merali |first1=Zeeya |title=Life possible in the early Universe |url=https://www.nature.com/news/life-possible-in-the-early-universe-1.14341 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |work=Nature |date=10 December 2013 |pages=201–201 |language=en |doi=10.1038/504201a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. Since the start of the matter-dominated era, the dark matter has gradually been gathering in huge spread out (diffuse) [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] under the effects of [[gravity]]. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter. It is also slightly more dense at regular distances due to early [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO) which became embedded into the distribution of matter when photons decoupled. Unlike dark matter, ordinary matter can lose energy by many routes, which means that as it collapses, it can lose the energy which would otherwise hold it apart, and collapse more quickly, and into denser forms. Ordinary matter gathers where dark matter is denser, and in those places it collapses into clouds of mainly hydrogen [[gas cloud|gas]]. The first stars and galaxies form from these clouds. Where numerous galaxies have formed, galaxy clusters and superclusters will eventually arise. Large [[void (cosmology)|voids]] with few stars will develop between them, marking where dark matter became less common.

Structure formation in the big bang model proceeds hierarchically, due to [[gravitational collapse]], with smaller structures forming before larger ones. The earliest structures to form are the first stars (known as [[population III stars]]), [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]], and [[quasar]]s (which are thought to be bright, early [[active galaxies]] containing a [[supermassive black hole]] surrounded by a inward-spiralling [[accretion disk]] of gas). Before this epoch, the evolution of the universe could be understood through linear cosmological [[perturbation theory]]: that is, all structures could be understood as small deviations from a perfect homogeneous universe. This is computationally relatively easy to study. At this point non-linear structures begin to form, and the [[computational problem]] becomes much more difficult, involving, for example, [[N-body simulation|''N''-body simulation]]s with billions of particles. The [[Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation]] is a high precision simulation of this era.

These Population III stars are also responsible for turning the few light elements that were formed in the Big Bang (hydrogen, helium and small amounts of lithium) into many heavier elements. They can be huge as well as perhaps small – and non-[[metallicity|metallic]] (no elements except hydrogen and helium). The larger stars have very short lifetimes compared to most Main Sequence stars we see today, so they commonly finish burning their hydrogen fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years, seeding the universe with heavier elements over repeated generations. They mark the start of the [[Stelliferous era|Stelliferous (starry) era]].

As yet, no Population III stars have been found, so our understanding of them is based on [[computational model]]s of their formation and evolution.  Fortunately, observations of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] radiation can be used to date when star formation began in earnest.  Analysis of such observations made by the European Space Agency's Planck telescope in 2016 concluded that the first generation of stars formed 700 million years after the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/planck-first-stars-formed-later-than-we-thought ''Planck: First Stars Formed Later Than We Thought''; NASA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quasar]]s provides some additional evidence of early structure formation. Their light shows evidence of elements such as [[carbon]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]] and [[oxygen]]. This is evidence that by the time quasars formed, a massive phase of [[star formation]] had already taken place, including sufficient generations of [[population III stars]] to give rise to these elements.

=== Reionization===
{{See also|Reionization|Dwarf galaxy|Quasar}}
As the [[population III star|first stars]], [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s gradually form, the intense radiation they emit reionizes much of the surrounding universe; splitting the neutral hydrogen atoms back into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of free [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s for the first time since [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]].

Reionization is evidenced from observations of [[quasar]]s. Quasars are a form of [[active galaxy]], and the most luminous objects observed in the universe. Electrons in neutral hydrogen have a specific patterns of absorbing photons, related to electron energy levels and called the [[Lyman series]]. Ionized hydrogen does not have electron energy levels of this kind. Therefore, light travelling through ionized hydrogen and neutral hydrogen shows different absorption lines. In addition, the light will have travelled for billions of years to reach us, so any absorption by neutral hydrogen will have been redshifted by varied amounts, rather than by one specific amount, indicating when it happened. These features make it possible to study the state of ionization at many different times in the past. They show that reionization began as "bubbles" of ionized hydrogen which became larger over time.&lt;ref name="dijkstra"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lyα Emitting Galaxies as a Probe of Reionization|date=5 August 2014|first=Mark|last=Dijkstra|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|doi=10.1017/pasa.2014.33|volume=31|arxiv = 1406.7292}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also show that the absorption was due to the general state of the universe (the [[intergalactic medium]]) and not due to passing through galaxies or other dense areas.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt; Reionization might have started as early as ''z''=16 (250 million years of cosmic time) and was complete by around ''z''=9 or 10 (500 million years). The epoch of reionization probably ended by around ''z''=5 or 6 (1 billion years) as the era of Population III stars and quasars – and their intense radiation – came to an end, and the ionized hydrogen gradually reverted to neutral atoms.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt;

These observations have narrowed down the period of time during which reionization took place, but the source of the photons that caused reionization is still not completely certain. To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 [[electronvolt|eV]] is required, which corresponds to [[ultraviolet]] photons with a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometre|nm]] or shorter, implying that the sources must have produced significant amount of ultraviolet and higher energy. Protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart, which also sets limits on how numerous the sources were and their longevity.&lt;ref name="qso_source1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Piero Madau | display-authors=etal | date=1999 | title=Radiative Transfer in a Clumpy Universe.

However, by this time, matter had become far more spread out due to the ongoing expansion of the universe. Although the neutral hydrogen atoms were again ionized, the plasma was much more thin and diffuse, and photons were much less likely to be scattered. Despite being reionized, the universe remained largely transparent during reionization. As the universe continued to cool and expand, reionization gradually ended.

Matter continues to draw together under the influence of [[gravity]], to form [[galaxy|galaxies]]. The stars from this time period, known as  [[Stellar population|Population II]] stars, are formed early on in this process, with more recent [[Stellar population|Population I]] stars formed later. Gravitational attraction also gradually pulls galaxies towards each other to form groups, [[galactic cluster|cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s.

== Current appearance of the Universe==

The universe has appeared much the same as it does now, for many billions of years. It will continue to look similar for many more billions of years into the future.

Based upon the emerging science of [[nucleocosmochronology]], the Galactic thin disk of the Milky Way is estimated to have been formed 8.8 ± 1.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Peloso/&gt;

=== Dark energy dominated era===
{{main|dark energy|Scale factor (cosmology)}}
:''From about 9.8 billion years after the Big bang''
From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large-scale behavior is believed to have gradually changed for the third time in its history. Its behavior had originally been dominated by radiation ([[special relativity|relativistic]] constituents such as photons and neutrinos) for the first 47,000 years, and since about 377,000 years of cosmic time, its behavior had been dominated by [[matter]]. During its matter-dominated era, the expansion of the universe had begun to slow down, as [[gravity]] reigned in the initial outward expansion. But from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, observations show that that the expansion of the universe slowly stops decelerating, and gradually begins to accelerate again, instead. 

While the precise cause is not known, the observation is accepted as correct by the cosmologist community. By far the most accepted understanding is that this is due to an unknown form of energy which has been given the name "[[dark energy]]".&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The cosmological constant and dark energy|year=2003|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|arxiv=astro-ph/0207347|volume=75|issue=2|pages=559–606|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.75.559|bibcode=2003RvMP...75..559P|last1=Peebles|first1=P.

Research is ongoing to understand this dark energy. Dark energy is now believed to be the single largest component of the universe, as it constitutes about 68.3% of the entire [[mass-energy]] of the physical universe.

Dark energy is believed to act like a [[cosmological constant]] - a [[scalar field]] that exists throughout space. Unlike gravity, the effects of such a field do not diminish (or only diminish slowly) as the universe grows. While matter and gravity have a greater effect initially, their effect quickly diminishes as the universe continues to expand. Objects in the universe, which are initially seen to be moving apart as the universe expands, continue to move apart, but their outward motion gradually slows down. This slowing effect becomes smaller as the universe becomes more spread out. Eventually, the outward and repulsive effect of dark energy begins to dominate over the inward pull of gravity. Instead of slowing down and perhaps beginning to move inward under the influence of gravity, from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, the expansion of space starts to slowly accelerate ''outward'' at a gradually ''increasing'' rate.

==Far future and ultimate fate==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe|Timeline of the far future}}
{{further|Future of an expanding universe|Heat death of the universe}}

The universe has existed for around 13.8 billion years, and we believe that we understand it well enough to predict its large-scale development for many billions of years into the future – perhaps as much as 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years from now). Beyond that, we need to better understand the universe to make any accurate predictions. Therefore, the universe could follow a variety of different paths beyond this time.

There are several competing scenarios for the possible long-term evolution of the universe. Which of them will happen, if any, depends on the precise values of [[physical constant]]s such as the [[cosmological constant]], the possibility of [[proton decay]], the [[False vacuum|energy of the vacuum]] (meaning, the energy of [[Vacuum state|"empty" space]] itself), and the natural laws [[beyond the Standard Model]].

If the expansion of the universe continues and it stays in its present form, eventually all but the nearest galaxies will be carried away from us by the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] at such a velocity that our [[observable universe]] will be limited to [[Laniakea Supercluster|our own]] gravitationally bound local [[galactic cluster]]. In the very long term (after many trillions – thousands of billions – of years, cosmic time), the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end, as stars cease to be born and even the [[red dwarf star|longest-lived stars]] gradually die. Beyond this, all objects in the universe will cool and (with the [[proton decay|possible exception of protons]]) gradually decompose back to their constituent particles and then into subatomic particles and very low level photons and other [[fundamental particle]]s, by a variety of possible processes. But this will take a duration of time that is almost inconceivable to most people, compared to which the entire 13.8 billion years of the universe would be a tiny instant in time.

Ultimately, in the extreme future, the following scenarios have been proposed for the ultimate fate of the universe.

{| class=wikitable
|-
| '''[[Heat death of the universe|Heat Death]]'''
| As expansion continues, the universe becomes larger, colder, and more dilute; in time, all structures eventually decompose to subatomic particles and photons.
| In the case of indefinitely continuing [[metric expansion of space]], the energy density in the universe will decrease until, after an estimated time of  10&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; years, it reaches [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] and no more structure will be possible. This will happen only after an extremely long time because first, all matter will collapse into [[black hole]]s, which will then evaporate extremely slowly via [[Hawking radiation]]. The universe in this scenario will cease to be able to support life much earlier than this, after some 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; years or so, when  [[star formation]] ceases.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337|title=A dying universe: The long-term fate and evolutionof astrophysical objects|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=69|issue=2|pages=337–372|last1=Adams|first1=Fred C|last2=Laughlin|first2=Gregory|year=1997|arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IID.&lt;/sup&gt;  In some [[grand unified theories]], [[proton decay]] after at least 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; years will convert the remaining interstellar gas and stellar remnants into leptons (such as positrons and electrons) and photons. Some positrons and electrons will then recombine into photons.&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IV,&amp;nbsp;§VF.&lt;/sup&gt; In this case, the universe has reached a high-[[entropy]] state consisting of a bath of particles and low-energy radiation. It is not known however whether it eventually achieves [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§VIB,&amp;nbsp;VID.&lt;/sup&gt; The hypothesis of a universal heat death stems from the 1850s ideas of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] ([[Lord Kelvin]])&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, William. (1851). "On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with numerical results deduced from Mr Joule's equivalent of a Thermal Unit, and M. Regnault's Observations on Steam." Excerpts. [§§1–14 &amp; §§99–100], ''Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', March, 1851; and ''Philosophical Magazine'' IV. 1852, [from ''Mathematical and Physical Papers'', vol. i, art. XLVIII, pp. 174]&lt;/ref&gt; who extrapolated the theory of heat views of mechanical energy loss in nature, as embodied in the first two laws of thermodynamics, to universal operation.
|-
| '''[[Big Rip]]'''
| Expansion of space accelerates and at some point becomes so extreme that even subatomic particles and the fabric of [[spacetime]] are pulled apart and unable to exist.
| For sufficiently large values for the [[dark energy]] content of the universe, the expansion rate of the universe will continue to increase without limit. Gravitationally bound systems, such as clusters of galaxies, galaxies, and ultimately the Solar System will be torn apart. Eventually the expansion will be so rapid as to overcome the electromagnetic forces holding molecules and atoms together. Even atomic nuclei will be torn apart. Finally, forces and interactions even on the [[Planck scale]] – the smallest size for which the notion of "space" currently has a meaning – will no longer be able to occur as the fabric of [[spacetime]] itself is pulled apart and the universe as we know it will end in an unusual kind of singularity.
|-
| '''[[Big Crunch]]'''
| Expansion eventually slows and halts, then reverses as all matter accelerates towards its common centre. Not now considered likely.
| In the opposite of the "Big Rip" scenario, the [[metric expansion of space]] would at some point be reversed and the universe would contract towards a hot, dense state. This is a required element of [[oscillatory universe]] scenarios, such as the [[cyclic model]], although a Big Crunch does not necessarily imply an oscillatory universe. Current observations suggest that this model of the universe is unlikely to be correct, and the expansion will continue or even accelerate.
|-
| '''[[Vacuum instability]]'''
| Collapse of the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, to a different form.
| Cosmology traditionally has assumed a stable or at least  [[metastability|metastable]] universe, but the possibility of a [[false vacuum]] in [[quantum field theory]] implies that the universe at any point in spacetime might spontaneously collapse into a lower energy state (see [[Bubble nucleation]]), a more stable or "true vacuum", which would then expand outward from that point with the speed of light.&lt;ref name="turnerwilczek"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is our vacuum metastable? |journal=Nature |volume=298 |date=1982 |issue=5875 |pages=633–634 |doi=10.1038/298633a0 |bibcode=1982Natur.298..633T |url=http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/Wilczek_Nature/%2872%29vacuum_metastable.pdf |access-date=2015-10-31|last1=Turner |first1=M.

The effect would be that the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, would undergo a transition to a more stable form. New forces and particles would replace the present ones we know of, with the side effect that all current particles, forces and structures would be destroyed and subsequently (if able) reform into different particles, forces and structures.

In this kind of extreme timescale, extremely rare [[quantum mechanics|quantum phenomena]] may also occur that are extremely unlikely to be seen on a timescale smaller than trillions of years. These may also lead to unpredictable changes to the state of the universe which would not be likely to be significant on any smaller timescale. For example, on a timescale of millions of trillions of years, [[black hole]]s might appear to evaporate almost instantly, uncommon [[quantum tunneling]] phenomena would appear to be common, and quantum (or other) phenomena so unlikely that they might occur just once in a trillion years may occur many times.

'''Comparative law''' is the study of differences and similarities between the [[law]] ([[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]) of different countries. More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal "systems" (or "families") in existence in the world, including the [[common law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], [[Canon law]], [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Hindu law]], and [[Chinese law]]. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, [[economic globalization]], and democratization.

==History==
The origins of modern Comparative Law can be traced back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1667 in his Latin-language book Nova Methodus Discendae Docendaeque Iurisprudentiae (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence).  Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. Notably, a few years earlier, Leibnitz introduced an idea of Language families.

Although every Legal System is unique, Comparative Law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of Legal Systems, wherein Law Families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between Law Families are found in the source(s) of Law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the Legal System. [[Montesquieu]] is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Laws|author=Baron De Montesquieu|place=New York |publisher=Hafner |year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|[T]he political and civil laws of each nation ... should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another.

They should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government: whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.

They should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.}}

Also, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that "to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety." Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:

[[Image:HSMaine.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Sir [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], British jurist and first professor of comparative law at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].]]
{{quote|As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.}}

The modern founding figure of comparative and [[legal anthropology|anthropological]] jurisprudence was Sir [[Henry Maine]], a British jurist and legal historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEk-Fpdw4MYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sir Henry Maine: A Study in Victorian Jurisprudence|author=Raymond Cocks|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1861 work ''[[Ancient Law|Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas]]'', he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of [[Far East|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|West]]ern legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.

The first university course on the subject was established at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358681/Sir-Henry-Maine|title=Sir Henry Maine|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, [[Rudolf Schlesinger]]. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at [[Cornell Law School]] helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.

==Purpose==
Comparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kristoffel Grechenig &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360''] comparing German style and U.S. style legal scholarship&lt;/ref&gt; and how their elements combine into a system.

Several disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative [[constitutional law]], comparative [[administrative law]], comparative [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] (in the sense of the law of [[tort]]s, [[delict]]s, [[contract]]s and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), comparative [[commercial law]] (in the sense of [[Companies law|business organisations]] and trade), and comparative [[criminal law]]. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:
* To attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect
* To perfect the legal systems in effect
* Possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the [[UNIDROIT]] initiative)

==Relationship with other legal subjects==
Comparative law is different from the fields of general [[jurisprudence]] (legal theory), [[international law]], including both [[public international law]] and [[private international law]] (also known as [[conflict of laws]]).

Despite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the [[United Nations System]], in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of [[legal transplants]], i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of [[legal transplants]] was coined by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.

Also, the usefulness of comparative law for [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]] (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law &amp; economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: 
* How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? 
* Are legal rules comparable? 
* How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?

==Classifications of legal systems==

===Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff===
Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff&lt;ref&gt;''Traité de droit comparé'' – in French; Paris 1950–1952&lt;/ref&gt; believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems ''per se'' get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the

* [[Law of France|French group]], under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic ''code civil'']] of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, [[Louisiana]], various South American states such as Brazil, [[Quebec]], [[Saint Lucia]], the [[Ionian Islands]], Egypt, and [[Lebanon]]
* [[Law of Germany|German group]]
* Scandinavian group, comprising the laws of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland
* [[Common law|English group]], including, ''inter alia'', England, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
* Russian group
* [[Sharia|Islamic group]] (used in the [[Muslim world]])
* [[Hindu law|Hindu group]]

===David===
[[René David]]&lt;ref&gt;''Traité élémentaire de droit civil comparé: Introduction à l'étude des droits étrangers et à la méthode comparative'' - in French; Paris, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:
* [[Western world|Western]] Laws, a group subdivided into the:
** [[Romano-Germanic law|Romano-Germanic subgroup]] (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to [[Roman Law]] – see [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]])
** [[Common law|Anglo-Saxon subgroup]]
* [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet Law]]
* [[Sharia|Muslim Law]]
* [[Hindu law|Hindu Law]]
* [[Chinese law|Chinese Law]]
* [[Jewish Law]]
Especially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are
* liberal democracy
* capitalist economy
* Christian religion

===Zweigert and Kötz===
Konrad Zweigert and [[Hein Kötz]] propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''An Introduction to Comparative Law'', translation from the German original: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung auf dem Gebiete des Privatrechts'' by Tony Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998. {{ISBN|9780198268598}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman law|Roman family]]
* [[Law of Germany|German family]]
* [[Common law|Common law family]]
* Nordic family
* Family of the laws of the [[Far East]] (China and Japan)
* Religious family (Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu law)

Up to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and Kötz also used to mention [[Socialist law|Soviet or socialist law]] as another family of laws.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung''. 3rd edition. 1996. Mohr Siebeck. Tübingen. 1996. {{ISBN|3-16-146548-2}} (Hein Kötz mentions in the preface to the third edition on page&amp;nbsp;V that the fall of "soviet communism" also made an end to the "soviet family of laws", which made it possible to save some 60&amp;nbsp;pages as compared to the 2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contemporary African art''' is commonly understood to be art made by artists in Africa and the African diaspora in the post-independence era. However, there are about as many understandings of contemporary African art as there are curators, scholars and artists working in that field. All three terms of this "wide-reaching noncategory [sic]"&lt;ref&gt;Firstenberg, Lauri (2003). "Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art – Production, Exhibition, Commodification", in Farrell, L. A., V. Byvanck (eds), ''Looking Both Ways: Art of the Contemporary African Diaspora''. New York: Museum for African Art, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; are problematic in themselves: What exactly is "contemporary", what makes art "African", and when are we talking about art and not any other kind of creative expression? Western scholars and curators have made numerous attempts at defining contemporary African art in the 1990s and early 2000s and proposed a range of categories and genres. They triggered heated debates and controversies especially on the foundations of postcolonial critique. Recent trends indicate a far more relaxed engagement with definitions and identity ascriptions. The global presence and entanglement of Africa and its contemporary artists have become a widely acknowledged fact that still requires and provokes critical reflection but finds itself beyond the pressure of self-justification.

== Scope ==
Although African art has always been contemporary to its producers, the term "contemporary African art" implies a particular kind of art that has conquered, or, as some would say, has been absorbed by the international art world and art market since the 1980s. It is in that decade when Europe and the US became aware of art made in Africa by individual artists, thus breaking with the colonial tradition of assuming collective "ethnic" origins of so-called "tribal art" as found in most ethnographic collections.&lt;ref name="Firstenberg, Lauri 2003 p. 37-41"&gt;Firstenberg (2003). "Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art", in Farrell and Byvanck (eds), ''Looking Both Ways'', pp. 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition ''Magiciens de la terre'' by [[Jean-Hubert Martin]] in 1989 is widely considered (but also challenged as) a key exhibition in this very recent history of international reception of African and other non-western art.  However, this reception, too, has its roots in an exotizing and mystifying view on African culture from a dominant western position, as [[Rasheed Araeen]] argued in his response to ''Magiciens de la terre''.&lt;ref name="Araeen, Rasheed 1989 p. 3-16"&gt;Araeen, Rasheed (1989). "Our Bauhaus Others' Mudhouse", ''Third Text'' no. 6, pp. 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Firstenberg, Lauri (2003). “Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art – Production, Exhibition, Commodification”, in Farrell, L. A., Byvanck, V. (eds), ''Looking both Ways: Art of the Contemporary African Diaspora''. New York: Museum for African Art, pp. 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, although this exhibition and many that followed had a strong influence in creating a kind of a common understanding of what constitutes contemporary African art, it is true that it has been and still is subject to discussions and controversies. Almost every exhibition following ''Magiciens de la terre'' offered a taxonomy or system of categorization that helped to reflect the very notion of contemporary African art, but they failed to recognize the postcolonial need of giving up the Eurocentric epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;Mosquera, Gerardo (1995). “Das Marco-Polo-Syndrom”, in Hermanns, U. (ed.), ''Havanna. Sao Paulo. Junge Kunst aus Lateinamerika''. Berlin: Haus der Kulturen der Welt, p. 34-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Firstenberg, Lauri 2003 p. 37-41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nzegwu, Nkiru 1998 p. 1-18"&gt;Nzegwu, Nkiru (1998). "Introduction: Contemporary African Art and Exclusionary Politics", ''Issues in Contemporary African Art''. Binghamton, NY: International Society for the Study of Africa ISSA, pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary African art is believed to feature particularities typical to African aesthetics while at the same time it shares properties with other international contemporary arts. Therefore, it is both, shaped by and feeding into the globalizing art worlds and art markets, like any other contemporary arts. At the same time, there are a lot of contemporary art practices and forms in African regions and cities that are almost exclusively locally known. While meeting all three requirements of being contemporary, art, and African, they fail to fit into a certain type of art production that has been spreading on the international art market in the last 30 years.

Exhibitions variously showed work by artists based in Africa; by artists using aesthetics typical to African traditions; by African artists living in the West but including aesthetics and topics related to their "roots";&lt;ref name="Araeen, Rasheed 1989 p. 3-16"/&gt; traditional artworks related to customary practices such as rituals; and urban African art that reflects the modern experience of cultural pluralism and hybridity. Modernity as a colonial and postcolonial experience appears as an intrinsic and significant attribute in most conceptions of contemporary African art. Scholars and curators therefore have proposed a wide range of taxonomies that tried firstly to define what is African about this art, and secondly, the range of genres it covers. Diverse attempts to define particular genres of contemporary African art however mirrored the fascination of art scholars and curators for the appropriation of cultural elements assumed "Western" into "African" modes of expression and traditions. One example is Marshall W. Mount&lt;ref&gt;Mount, Marshall W. (1973). ''African Art: The Years since 1920.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed four categories: first, "survivals of traditional styles", which show continuities in traditional working material and methods such as bronze casting or wood carving; secondly, art inspired by Christian missions; thirdly, souvenir art in the sense of tourist or airport art as defined later by Jules-Rossette;&lt;ref&gt;Jules-Rosette, Bennetta (1984). ''The Messages of Tourist Art: An African Semiotic System in Comparative Perspective.'' Boston: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, an emerging art requiring "techniques that were unknown or rare in traditional African art".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall W. Mount (1973) quoted in: Mudimbe, Valentin Y. (1991). "'Reprendre': Enunciations and Strategies in Contemporary African Arts", in Vogel, S. (ed.), ''Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art''. Munich: Prestel, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Valentin Y. Mudimbe in turn proposes to think of three currents rather than categories, namely a "tradition-inspired" one, a "modernist" trend, and "a popular art"&lt;ref name="Mudimbe, Valentin Y. 1991 p. 280"&gt;Mudimbe, Valentin Y. (1991). "'Reprendre': Enunciations and Strategies in Contemporary African Arts", in Vogel, S. (ed.), ''Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art''. Munich: Prestel, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; whereby Mount’s categories would be situated somewhere "between the tradition-inspired and the modernist trend”.&lt;ref name="Mudimbe, Valentin Y. 1991 p. 280"/&gt; Similar to other categorizations, this proposal considers the education of the artists as well as the envisaged clientele/patrons as important factors for the respective "currents". In the exhibition catalogue of ''Africa Explores'' (1991), curator Susan Vogel distinguished between "traditional art", "new functional art", "urban art", "international art", and "extinct art".&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Susan, ed. (1991). ''Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art''. Munich: Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting these categories, collector André Magnin proposed to group similar works into sections named "territory", "frontier" and "world" in his survey book ''Contemporary African Art'', thus placing them into "imaginary maps".&lt;ref&gt;Magnin, André, and Jacques Soulillou, eds (1996). ''Contemporary Art of Africa.'' London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach was also criticized by Dele Jegede with convincing arguments against its ethnocentric perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Jegede, Dele (1998). "On Scholars and Magicians: A Review of 'Contemporary Art of Africa'", in Nzegwu, N. (ed.), ''Issues in Contemporary African Art''. Binghamton: International Society for the Study of Africa ISSA, pp. 187-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, he pointed to the hubris of attempts to talk about art of a whole continent, but also to the common reflex to exclude Northern Africa in such considerations and to follow a global rather than "particularistic focus on the study of the art of the continent" that would provide more specific and deeper bodies of knowledge. In the 1990 exhibition ''Contemporary African Artists: Changing Tradition'', the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] tried to take the perspective of the presented artists and distinguished between African artists who refuse outside influences; African artists who adopt modes of Western art; and African artists who fuse both strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Studio Museum, ed. (1990): ''Contemporary African Artists. Changing Tradition''. New York: Studio Museum in Harlem.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonality to all these categorizations is their reliance on dichotomies between art and craft, Europe and Africa, urban and rural, and traditional and contemporary. These dichotomies tend to consider mutual influences in African and European art as an exception rather than the norm. Even more, they fail to think of African art independent from Europe as its counterpart or "influence", resulting in a frequent reproach of African artists "copycatting" or "mimicking" European achievements of modernism.&lt;ref name="Oguibe, Olu 1999 p. 16-29"&gt;Oguibe, Olu (1999). "Art, Identity, Boundaries: Postmodernism and Contemporary African Art", in Oguibe, O., and O. Enwezor (eds), ''Reading the Contemporary: African Art from Theory to the Marketplace''. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp. 16–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nzegwu, Nkiru 1998 p. 1-18"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Enwezor, Okwui, and Chika Okeke-Agulu (2009). ''Contemporary African Art since 1980.'' Bologna: Damiani, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasfir, Sidney L. (1999). ''Contemporary African Art.'' London/New York: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; Such Eurocentric attitudes have been revealingly criticized by theorists such as [[Olu Oguibe]],&lt;ref name="Oguibe, Olu 1999 p. 16-29"/&gt; Rasheed Araeen,&lt;ref name="Araeen, Rasheed 1989 p. 3-16"/&gt; Nkiru Nzegwu,&lt;ref name="Nzegwu, Nkiru 1998 p. 1-18"/&gt; [[Okwui Enwezor]] or Salah Hassan.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Salah (1999). "The Modernist Experience in African Art: Visual Expressions of the Self and Cross-cultural Aesthetics", in Oguibe, O., and O. Enwezor (eds), ''Reading the Contemporary: African Art from Theory to the Marketplace''. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp. 214–235.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is not easy to solve, and in some cases it is tackled by simply subverting any attempt of categorization. ''Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa'', directed by [[Clémentine Deliss]] and curated by [[Chika Okeke-Agulu]], Salah Hassan, [[David Koloane]], Wanjiku Nyachae and El Hadji Sy (London, 1995) is a case in point.&lt;ref&gt;Deliss, Clémentine, ed. (1995). ''Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa.'' Paris/New York: Flammarion.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than grafting binary taxonomies, it narrated seven modern art histories in different parts of Africa by invited curators and artists who were familiar with these recent histories and their respective art scenes. The exhibition proved to offer a highly complex, historically informed and well-researched presentation. Another example for subverting binary taxonomies is the book ''Contemporary African Art after 1980'' by Okwui Enwezor and Chika Okeke-Agulu.&lt;ref&gt;Enwezor, Okwui, and Chika Okeke-Agulu (2009). ''Contemporary African Art since 1980.'' Bologna: Damiani.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than putting contemporary African art in relation to Western traditions, they contrast it with modern African art, in that it defies linear grand narratives of modernism and is radically postcolonial. "[F]irst, within categories of time, it is neither belated nor does it exist out of time; second, because it is post-historical, it did not emerge out of a succession of historical styles; third, because it is critical of colonial valorization of an authentic past, it is postcolonial; and fourth, in relation to its postcoloniality, it seeks, according to Hans Belting’s thesis, to be post-ethnic […]. Neither being out of time nor belated, contemporary African art strategically inhabits a third epistemological space by being in time."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As they add, this being "fundamentally of its time" counts for all contemporary art, not only the African. In their book, Enwezor and Okeke-Agulu discuss contemporary African art by its approaches and guiding topics rather than trying to define categories on the basis of styles, markets or traditions. Their chapters therefore are designated as "Between postcolonial utopia and postcolonial realism", "Networks of practice" in the globalized field of cultural production, "Politics, culture and critique", "Archive, document, memory", "Abstraction, figuration and subjectivity" and "The body politic: difference, gender, sexuality". Doing so, they locate contemporary African art within a historical perspective, something that had largely missed in previous discussions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10116">'''Crib talk''' or '''crib speech''' is pre-sleep [[monologue]] made by [[Toddler|young children]] while in bed. This starts somewhere around one-and-a-half years and usually ends by about two-and-a-half years of age, though children can continue longer.&lt;ref name="Weir"&gt;Weir RH. (1962). Language in the Crib. University of Michigan; Edition 2, (1970) Mouton. {{OCLC|300988484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson89"&gt;Nelson K. Oster E., Bruner JS.
 (Ed). (1989). Narratives from the crib. Cambridge, MA, US: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02363-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of [[Conversation|conversational discourse]] with [[Turn-Taking|turn-taking]] often containing [[semantics|semantically]] and [[syntax|syntactically]] coherent question-answer sequences. It may contain [[word play]] and bits of [[song]] and [[nursery rhyme]].

Crib talk has been found in [[deaf]] children in their early [[sign language]].&lt;ref&gt;Petitto LA. (2000). [http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~petitto/biof.pdf  On The Biological Foundations of Human Language]. In K. Emmorey and H. Lane (Eds.) The signs of language revisited: An anthology in honor of Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima. Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; It also occurs in autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schaerlaekens | first1 = A. | title = Crib speech in autistic and psychotic children: Case studies of form, content and function | doi = 10.1177/014272379701705114 | journal = First Language | volume = 17 | issue = 51 | pages = 303–310 | year = 1997 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Crib talk has been divided into three somewhat overlapping varieties.&lt;ref name="Nelson89chapter"&gt;[[Katherine Nelson|Nelson K.]] (1989). Monologue as representation of real-life experience (pp.27-72) In Narratives from the crib. Cambridge, MA, US: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02363-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enactment sequences===
This occurs most commonly in early monologues and is done in a low tone. It concerns using language to bring about action and occurs when playing with [[toy]]s and [[doll]]s as “[[Imaginary friend|friends]]” with language embedded in ongoing [[Play (activity)|play]]. Whilst like conversational speech, it can occur in long uninterrupted sequences in which the child describes what they are doing.

===Proto-narrative===
In this a child creates a story about events that have happened or [[Imaginary world|imaginary events]] in temporal-causal sequences that can be as short as five words or as long as 150. They may include the reciting of [[Bedtime story|stories]] that have been read to them. They occur throughout the period in which a child engages in crib talk.

===Problem focused===
These concern what happened in the past, what will happen in the future and how events are organized. They incorporate descriptions used by others to enable [[prediction]].

==Function==
Such monologues have been argued to play a key role in providing a practice space for developing complex connected discourse,&lt;ref name="Weir"/&gt;  aiding a child to use language as a tool to [[categorize]], [[explain]] and know the world,&lt;ref name="Feldman"&gt;Feldman CF. (1989). Monologue as problem solving narrative
 (pp. 98-120) In Narratives from the crib. Cambridge, MA, US: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02363-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to “clarify what may originally have been problematic or troublesome”.&lt;ref name="Bruner"&gt;Bruner J Lucariello J (1989). Monologue as Narrative Recreation of the World
 (pp.73-97) In Narratives from the crib. Cambridge, MA, US: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02363-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such talk is more complex than that done by children in interactions with others,&lt;ref name="Weir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuczaj"&gt;Kuczaj S. (1983). Crib speech and language play. New York: Springer Verlag. {{ISBN|978-0-387-90860-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this has been suggested to be due to the freedom to control what they say and so not have their cognitive abilities stretched by having to work out how to respond to what someone has just said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-72010-6}}  (Original work published 1934)&lt;/ref&gt; crib talk lacks its [[self-control|self-regulatory]] instructions.&lt;ref name="Nelson89chapter1"&gt;[[Katherine Nelson|Nelson K.]] (1989). Introduction: Monologues in the crib. (pp. 1-24) In Narratives from the crib. Cambridge, MA, US: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02363-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17–19}}

==Research==

===Problems===
Crib talk is difficult to transcribe because such young children typically have poor pronunciation, and because there may be little context to infer the likely meaning of a child’s words, even with the help of a parent. This has limited the number of children studied and the length of time over which the development of crib talk monologues have been researched.&lt;ref name="Nelson89"/&gt;

The children studied are also atypical in that they are the offspring of researchers or their close colleagues, and so are from highly educated backgrounds. The child studied by [[Katherine Nelson]], for example, was highly precocious in her language abilities, which raises questions about the generality of findings on that one child.&lt;ref name="Nelson89"/&gt;

===Studies===
Crib talk was first studied by Ruth Hirsch Weir on her son Anthony and published in 1962.&lt;ref name="Weir"/&gt; Two other studies have been carried out by Stan Kuczaj  on 14 children between 15–30 months - published in 1983&lt;ref name="Kuczaj"/&gt; - and Katherine Nelson on Emily in 1989.&lt;ref name="Nelson89chapter1"/&gt;

==Examples==

===Anthony===
Anthony is here between 28 and 30 months playing at grammatical transformations and combinations.

=="In the Dark"==

[[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]] has noted that the last two verses of [[A. A. Milne]]'s poem "In the Dark" in ''[[Now We Are Six]]'' echoes the verbal play of crib talk.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, G. (1962) Foreword by a psychologist, pp. 13-17, In Weir RH. (1962). Language in the Crib. University of Michigan; Edition 2, (1970) Mouton. {{OCLC|300988484}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;So—here I am in the dark alone,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There's nobody here to see;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I think to myself,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I play to myself,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And nobody knows what I say to myself;
Here I am in the dark alone,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What is it going to be?
I can think whatever I like to think,
I can play whatever I like to play,
I can laugh whatever I like to laugh,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There's nobody here but me.

I'm talking to a rabbit ...
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm talking to the sun ...
I think I am a hundred—
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm one.
I'm lying in a forest ...
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm lying in a cave ...
I'm talking to a Dragon ...
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm BRAVE.
I'm lying on my left side ...
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm lying on my right ...
I'll play a lot tomorrow ...
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...........
I'll think a lot tomorrow ...
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...........
I'll laugh ...
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a lot ...
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;tomorrow ...

'''Dry January''' is a public health campaign urging people to abstain from alcohol for the month of January, particularly practised in the [[United Kingdom]].

The campaign, as a formal entity, appears to be relatively recent, being described as having "sprung up in recent years" even in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1327579/government-unveils-first-dry-january-marketing-campaign|title=Government unveils first 'Dry January' marketing campaign|publisher=Marketingmagazine.co.uk|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Finnish government had launched a campaign called "Sober January" in 1942 as part of its war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viestijat.fi/raitis-tammikuu-1942-oli-tehokas-propagandahyokkays/|title=”Raitis tammikuu” (1942) oli tehokas propagandahyökkäys|publisher=viestijat.fi|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Dry January" was registered as a trademark by the charity [[Alcohol Concern]] in mid-2014;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trademark.markify.com/trademarks/ctm/dry+january/012826863/?lang=lv|title=Trademark information for DRY JANUARY from CTM - by Markify|publisher=Trademark.markify.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first ever Dry January campaign by Alcohol Concern occurred in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhealthylifestylemag.com/#!dry-january/c1abx|title=ALL ABOUT DRY JANUARY 2014|publisher=Mhealthylifestylemag.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the leadup to the January 2015 campaign, for the first time Alcohol Concern partnered with [[Public Health England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbc.co.uk/festive-drinkers-urged-to-try-dry-january-102171|title=Festive Drinkers Urged To Try 'Dry January'|work=LBC|accessdate=2 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102212331/http://www.lbc.co.uk/festive-drinkers-urged-to-try-dry-january-102171|archivedate=2 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 according to Alcohol Concern, which initiated the campaign,{{when|date=January 2015}} over 17,000 Britons stopped drinking for that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/article4309925.ece|title=Abstinence after the boozing. Can you make it a dry January?|work=The Times|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is controversy as to the efficacy and benefits of the practice, a 2014 survey by the University of Sussex found that six months following January 2014, out of 900 surveyed participants in the custom, 72% had "kept harmful drinking episodes down" and 4% were still not drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-30038307|title=BBC News - 'Dry January' linked to drinking less in long term|work=BBC News|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Norbert wiener.jpg|thumb|right|Norbert Weiner, the founder of cybernetics.]]
'''Dualism in cybernetics''' refers to systems or problems in which one or more [[intelligent]] adversaries attempt to exploit the weaknesses of the investigator. Examples could include a game-playing opponent, adversarial law, evolutionary systems of predator/parasite and prey/host, or politics/enslavement attempts. [[Norbert Wiener]], the founder of [[cybernetics]], contrasted "[[Manichean]] devils" (dualistic adversarial systems) with "[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] devils"—systems or problems that, though very complex and difficult to figure out, did not feature an adversary with contrary intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubberly.com/articles/cybernetics-and-counterculture.html|title=How cybernetics connects computing, counterculture, and design|website=www.dubberly.com|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victories or "expansions of knowledge" in the latter type of system were able to be built upon incrementally, through science (experimentation expanding empirical knowledge bases). Wiener noted that temporary weaknesses (such as errors to perceive all components of a system) were not fatal in attempts to defeat "Augustinian devils" because another experiment could simply be pursued (and he noted that he had personally defeated many "Augustinian devils" with his contributions to science and engineering). By contrast, Wiener observed that temporary lapses in judgment against "Manichean devils" were more often fatal or destructive, due to the desire of the opponent to "win/survive at all costs", even by introducing deception into the system. He said that he had been defeated by many "Manichean devils", such as on occasions when he was temporarily careless in chess.

Although this duality between complexity (in the case of the Augustinian devils) and opposition (in the case of Manichean devils) may seem obvious, it holds deep implications for many areas of science, such as [[game theory]], [[political science]], [[computer science]], [[network science]], [[Security|security science]], [[military science]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Cont/ContSato.htm|title=20th WCP: The Significance of System Cybernetics for Contemporary Philosophy- Post-Modernity in System Cybernetics|website=www.bu.edu|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1068">A '''duckbill''', '''bearpaw''' or '''cow's mouth''' was a style of shoe with a broad toe which was fashionable in the 15th and 16th centuries.  This style started with [[Charles VIII of France]], who had an [[polydactyly|extra toe]] and was later worn by [[Henry VIII of England]].  It replaced the excessively long toe of the ''[[poulaine]]'' but also tended to become impractical as it became enlarged with stuffing and horns and so could be a foot wide, giving the wearer a waddling gait.  It might also be adorned with slashes to show the fine lining and [[sumptuary law]]s were introduced to restrict all these excesses.&lt;ref name=Bossan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mello/&gt;

'''''Emanuelle Around the World''''' (''Emanuelle – Perché violenza alle donne?''), also known as ''The Degradation of Emanuelle'' and  ''Confessions of Emanuelle'', is a 1977 [[sexploitation]] film by Italian director [[Joe D'Amato]], starring [[Laura Gemser]] and [[George Eastman (actor)|George Eastman]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Emanuelle perche violenza alle donne?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/303239/Emanuelle-perche-violenza-alle-donne-/details}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was one of the most expensive films ever made in Italy at that time, not just in cast but in locations. The filming was done in many countries; Hong Kong, Iran, Nepal (though it is billed as being shot in India), America and in a studio in Italy. It features a notable cast, including Gemser, [[Karin Schubert]],&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; [[Ivan Rassimov]] and Eastman.

== Plot ==
Emanuelle is invited to India to write a report on Guru Shanti, a man who claims to have achieved the ultimate orgasm. Once there she engages in a variety of sex acts, including one with the Guru; she disproves his theory. She then heads to Hong Kong to investigate trafficked women. Once she then arrives back in America, she teams up with fellow reporter Cora Norman and both of them snoop out a trail of men smuggling women to the Middle East.

== Cast ==
*[[Laura Gemser]]... Emanuelle
*[[Ivan Rassimov]] ... Dr. Malcolm Robertson 
*[[Karin Schubert]] ... Cora Norman 
*Don Powell ... Jeff Davis 
*[[George Eastman (actor)|George Eastman]] ... Guru Shanti 
*Brigitte Petronio ... Mary 
*Maria Luigia Stefania Pecce ...
*[[Marino Masé]] ... Cassei

== Controversy ==
This film has been subject to much censorship in various territories. The version screened in France and some other European territories contains hardcore footage not found in the original cut. One scene is particularly controversial, as it depicts sexual torture involving a woman, a German Shepherd dog, and a snake. It is not clear whether these were merely [[Insert (filmmaking)|inserts]] or filmed at the time of principal shooting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="616">The '''footman''' is a British term for a metal stand, usually of polished steel or brass, and either oblong or oval in shape, for keeping plates and dishes hot before a dining room fire. A footman was useful prior to the early 20th century, before hot water was easily obtained, and when open fires were common. Although it is still in occasional use, it is now chiefly regarded as an ornament or collectable [[antique]]. The derivation of the word is probably linked to the servant, who could also have had the task of warming the dishes.

}}Various styles of writing form are used in this website specially the [[Languages of India|Indian]] form of writing and the [[Indian literature]]. The site has also take care and attracted media attention for its articles on controversial subjects including [[religion]], prominent people, places, [[politics]], Indian villages, [[Indian culture|culture]] and the special form of art.

== Slogan and Moto ==
The slogan of this wiki is ''Made in India'' and the Moto is ''Shows The Unseen Side''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.gyaanipedia.co.in/wiki/Gyaanipedia|title=Gyaanipedia - Gyaanipedia|website=en.gyaanipedia.co.in|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it also import that pages which were rejected and deleted from [[Wikipedia]]. This website is created specially for Indians. It is much like [[Deletionpedia]].

== History ==
Since last one year Shaunak Chakraborty is watching the Indian people who are struggling to create a page in [[Wikipedia]], but we all knew it very well that how much difficult it is be. He develop sympathy for the people of his nation he want to do something for them. On 1 April 2018 he invited his closed relatives Anandita Bist, Sai Gaurav, Daksh, Akansha Kumari and Tejas for a group discussion on this topic, they suggested to create a site like [[Wikipedia]]. It was too difficult to create a same site. On 25 July 2018 Shaunak Chakraborty visited to a site makers for some suggestions he had told the entire process that how he can create a site like [[Wikipedia]]. On 16 August 2018 '''Gyaanimedia Foundation''' was formed by ''Shaunak Chakraborty'' and his sister ''Anandita Bist''. Under this foundation finally the website [[Gyaanipedia]] was formed on 30 August 2018 which was a online historical day for those struggling people of India. This site was formed under [[Fandom|Wikia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gyaanipedia.wikia.com|title=Gyaanipedia Wiki|website=gyaanipedia.wikia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was powered by [[Wikia|Fandom]] which actually came into force on 31 October 2018. But he needs a independent site so on 05 November 2018 the independent [[Gyaanipedia]] was finally launched. The first Indian online [[encyclopedia]] with no restrictions and also it is the first wiki website which have [[Indian Standard Time|IST]] (Indian Standard Time) time zone. It also works under the same [[MediaWiki|Mediawiki]] as [[Wikipedia]]. On 09 November 2018 the Hindi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hi.gyaanipedia.co.in|title=ज्ञानीपीडिया|website=hi.gyaanipedia.co.in|language=hi|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bangla&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bn.gyaanipedia.co.in|title=জ্ঞানীপিডিয়া|website=bn.gyaanipedia.co.in|language=bn|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; version was launched, on 12 November 2018 Telugu&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://te.gyaanipedia.co.in|title=గ్యానిపెడియా|website=te.gyaanipedia.co.in|language=te|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; version was launched.

'''''Hammerman''''' is a [[Saturday morning cartoon]], produced by [[DIC Entertainment]] and starring pop [[rapper]] [[MC Hammer]], which aired for thirteen episodes on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the fall of 1991.

==Synopsis==
Youth center worker Stanley Burrell (Hammer's real name) owns a pair of magical dancing shoes (which are alive and can speak), which when worn cause Burrell to transform into the [[superhero]] Hammerman. He frequently gets advice from his "Gramps", who was a former owner of the shoes and was known as Soulman. While in the guise of Hammerman, Burrell was dressed in MC Hammer's signature purple [[Hammer pants]] and myriad golden chains.

The show was hosted by the real [[MC Hammer]], who also sang the show's theme song, telling about the origin of Hammerman. Back in the 1960s and 1970s, Gramps (Robert Nameson) was the superhero Soulman, but as he grew older, he grew weaker and was forced to retire. Gramps and his granddaughter Jodie traveled to find the next new superhero. Their search was over when they met Stanley and he put on the shoes. Each episode, Hammerman faced various social issues; at the end of each episode, a puppet version of the magic shoes would speak to a live child audience and provide methods the children could use to address these issues themselves.

==Episodes==
While the airdates and order of most episodes is unknown, "Defeated Graffiti", the first episode (as confirmed by MC Hammer's comments at the beginning of the episode), aired on September 7, 1991.

The cartoon aired on Saturday mornings at 10 AM on ABC.

Known episodes are as follows:

Most''' heated clothing''' is designed for cold-weather sports and activities, such as [[motorcycle]] riding, [[downhill skiing]], [[Diving (sport)|diving]], [[winter biking]], and [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]], trekking and for outdoor workers such as [[construction worker]]s and [[carpenter]]s. Since the London Olympics, heated clothing has also been used by athletes to keep their muscles warm between the warm-up and the race.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a20791795/electric-warm-up-pants/|title=Electric Warm-Up Pants|date=2013-09-04|work=Runner's World|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normal insulation works by trapping body heat, so if it gets wet from sweat or rain, or if a person stops exercising, the insulation may not keep them warm. With heated garments, a person can keep warm even if they are resting and not producing heat, or if their coat is damp from sweat.

==Types==

There are many types of heated clothing. Most notably these use 12, 7, and 5-volt powerbanks.

The 5-volt powerbank allows one to use a common powerbank for both heating apparel and charging personal electronics.
 
The 7-volt battery is the most common type of heated clothing battery system, and may be rechargeable. The most popular items sold have traditionally been heated gloves and jackets.

12-volt batteries are designed for use with motorcycles, ATVs, or snowmobiles, and draw their power from the vehicle's battery. As these use a higher voltage than 7v systems, they are more powerful and therefore heat a larger area at a higher temperature. Most brands using 12v systems are compatible. For instance, most 12v heated jackets come with built-in power cords that come out at the wrists to power heated gloves/liners and out from the bottom to power heated pants/liners. The pants then have cords coming from the bottom of each leg to power socks/liners/insoles.

Most 7v garments will power for around 2-8 hours depending on heat setting and outside conditions. Many jackets and vests can be powered for almost double this time with an extended-life battery, available separately.

===By function===
The most widely available types of heated clothing are products for the extremities; the hands and feet. These parts are the most likely to suffer [[frostbite]] or frostnip in severe cold. As such, many manufacturers make heated gloves, mittens, socks, and [[boot liner]]s, which can be purchased at workers' supply stores (serving construction workers) and motor sports stores. Heated torso coverings like vests, jackets, or leggings are available from specialty retailers that cater to motorcyclists and downhill skiers.

Related products are heated seat covers, throws, and seating pads. Heated seat covers for snowmobiles, motorcycles, and cars and heated throw blankets typically use electrical 12-volt heating elements. Heated seating pads for hunting, canoeing, and stadium use either have rechargeable batteries or use reheatable gel packs.

In a joint project of adidas, British Cycling and Loughborough University's Environmental Ergonomics Research Centre, the use of heated clothing for reducing the muscle temperature drop in athletes between their warm-up period and the actual race was investigated, and the 'adidas hot pants' were used by the track cycling team at the London Olympics with great success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The science behind this has been published in a series of papers by Faulkner et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faulkner|first=Steve H.|last2=Ferguson|first2=Richard A.|last3=Hodder|first3=Simon G.|last4=Havenith|first4=George|date=2013-08-23|title=External muscle heating during warm-up does not provide added performance benefit above external heating in the recovery period alone|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|language=en|volume=113|issue=11|pages=2713–2721|doi=10.1007/s00421-013-2708-6|pmid=23974847|issn=1439-6319|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/13060|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=FAULKNER|first=STEVE H.|last2=FERGUSON|first2=RICHARD A.|last3=GERRETT|first3=NICOLA|last4=HUPPERETS|first4=MAARTEN|last5=HODDER|first5=SIMON G.|last6=HAVENITH|first6=GEORGE|date=2013|title=Reducing Muscle Temperature Drop after Warm-up Improves Sprint Cycling Performance|url=https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00005768-201302000-00020|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|language=en|volume=45|issue=2|pages=359–365|doi=10.1249/mss.0b013e31826fba7f|pmid=22935735|issn=0195-9131|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkins and Havenith,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkins|first=Emma L|last2=Havenith|first2=George|date=2016-06-10|title=External heating garments used post-warm-up improve upper body power and elite sprint swimming performance|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part P: Journal of Sports Engineering and Technology|language=en|volume=231|issue=2|pages=91–101|doi=10.1177/1754337116650322|issn=1754-3371|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/21221|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Raccuglia et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raccuglia|first=Margherita|last2=Lloyd|first2=Alex|last3=Filingeri|first3=Davide|last4=Faulkner|first4=Steve H.|last5=Hodder|first5=Simon|last6=Havenith|first6=George|date=2015-11-21|title=Post-warm-up muscle temperature maintenance: blood flow contribution and external heating optimisation|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|language=en|volume=116|issue=2|pages=395–404|doi=10.1007/s00421-015-3294-6|issn=1439-6319|pmc=4717164|pmid=26590591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===

====Electrical====
Heated clothing designed for use on vehicles such as motorbikes or snowmobiling typically use a 12-volt electric current, the standard voltage on motorsport and powersport batteries. While a single heated garment, such as heated gloves, will not usually adversely affect the charge on the battery, riders have to be careful about attaching several heated garments because the battery may not be able to handle the load. The heated garments are usually attached directly onto the battery of the bike. Some heated garments have cigarette lighter plugs. While the least expensive models can only be turned on or off, more expensive models sometimes provide a heating level control. 

For downhill skiing or winter biking, rechargeable nickel metal or lithium batteries are generally used. If not recharged properly, "battery memory" will shorten the battery's capability to recharge. There are two types of lithium batteries: Li-ion &amp; Li-Polymer, which use several types of heating technologies including copper wire, [[nichrome]] wire, metal "mesh" systems, carbon-embedded fabric, [[carbon fibers]] and very thin flexible heating technologies that can be printed onto substrate. This has allowed for extra features to be added such as temperature sensors, [[Bluetooth]] integration and the ability to control the temperature from a [[smartphone]]. 

The most reliable systems have technologies that have redundancy in case of a heating element breakage.

The controller and battery in some models can be detached so that the garment can be worn as a regular garment.

Garments that use gel have cloth pouches or pockets where plastic packages of the gel can be inserted in the garment. Prior to going outdoors, the gel is heated in a microwave. Once outdoors, the gel pack retains its heat for 30 minutes to two hours, depending on the size of the gel pack, the thickness of the insulation protecting the gel pack from the outdoor temperatures, and wind conditions.

====Chemical====

Chemical reaction-based garments have cloth pouches or pockets, where single-use packages of chemical [[hand warmer]]s can be inserted. The warmers are about the size of a package of cards, and they contain chemicals which produce heat. One traditional hand warmer is a small metal box containing charcoal which, when lit, burns very slowly and produces a mild heat. Disposable heat packs typically contain cellulose, iron, water, activated carbon, vermiculite, and salt. When these packs are exposed to air, an exothermic chemical reaction occurs, which provides several hours of heat. Another chemical heating pad uses a gel that can be activated by twisting the package, thus triggering a chemical reaction. The pack can be put in a pot of boiling water to convert the chemical reaction back and allow it to be reused. While these products are commonly called "hand warmers", they can be placed in boots or, with special garments such as vests, in cloth pockets on the inside of the garment. The warmth produced by these tends to be lowest among the above heating methods.

[[File:Brigitswell.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Brigid's Well]], near [[Buttevant]], [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]]]]
A '''holy well''' or '''sacred spring''' is a [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] or other small body of water revered either in a [[Christian]] or [[Paganism|pagan]] context, sometimes both. The term ''holy well'' is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e. not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in the [[folklore]] of the area where it is located, whether in the form of a particular name, an associated [[legend]], the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the [[numen|numinous]] presence of its guardian spirit or Christian [[saint]], or a ceremony or [[ritual]] centred on the well site. In Christian legend, the water is often said to have been made to flow by the action of a saint, a familiar theme especially in the [[hagiography]] of Celtic saints.

==Nomenclature and etymology==
The term ''haeligewielle'' is in origin an [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] toponym attached to specific springs in the landscape;&lt;ref&gt;J. Harte, 'Holey Wells and other Holey Places', ''Living Spring Journal'', 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; its current use has arisen through folklore scholars, [[antiquarians]], and other writers generalising from those actual 'Holy Wells' which survived into the modern era. The term 'holy-hole' is sometimes employed.&lt;ref  name="ARoss"&gt;A. Ross, ''Pagan Celtic Britain'' (London: RKP), 1967, 107; Willy Worcestre, ''Itinerary'', ed. J. Harvey (Oxford: Clarendon), 1981, pp. 290-291.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms '[[hole (disambiguation)|hole]]' and '[[holy]]' are [[etymon]]s.

==Culture and representation==
Holy wells in different forms occur in such a wide variety of cultures, religious environments, and historical periods that it is usually held that it is a universal human instinct to revere sources of water.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. J. &amp; C. Bord, ''Sacred Waters'' (London: Granada), 1985, pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the fragmentary nature of the evidence, and the historical differences among cultures and nations, make it very hard to generalize.  While there are a few national studies of holy well lore and history, mainly concentrating on [[Ireland]] and the [[British Isles]], there is a need for more work examining other regions.

The earliest work specifically devoted to holy wells is [[Philip Dixon Hardy]]'s ''Holy Wells of Ireland'' (1836), a [[Protestant]] attack on [[Catholic]] observances at Irish wells bearing the names of Christian [[saints]], or otherwise considered sacred. By the later 19th century, the term had acquired its current usage: Robert Charles Hope's ''The Legendary Lore of the Holy Wells of England'' (1893), the first general survey of its kind, included a number of named wells which were not dedicated to saints (as well as some rivers and lakes with associated folklore, as Hope mentioned in his subtitle).

==Exegesis==
In [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] a [[nymphaeum]] or nymphaion ({{lang-el|νυμφαίον}}), was a [[monument]] consecrated to the [[nymph]]s, especially those of [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]].

In England, there are examples of reverence for wells and springs at a variety of historical periods. The medieval traveller [[William Worcester|William of Worcester]] saw a 'holy-hole, or well' within the cave at [[Wookey]] ([[Somerset]]), a site of human habitation in the [[Palaeolithic]] era and the source of a river which had been the site of ritual activity.&lt;ref  name="ARoss"/&gt; The proximity of named springs to [[Neolithic]] or [[Iron Age]] monuments, such as the Swallowhead Springs, close to [[Silbury Hill]] ([[Wiltshire]]) or the Holy Well near Tadmarton Hill ([[Oxfordshire]]), suggests that reverence for such sites continued without a break. There is abundant evidence for the importance of wells and springs in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Sub-Roman Britain|sub-Roman period]], not just at temple complexes such as [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (Somerset), [[Chedworth]] ([[Gloucestershire]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Living Spring Journal'' '''2''', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and Blunsdon Ridge ([[Wiltshire]])&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | place = UK | url = http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind9905&amp;L=wells-and-spas&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=4844 | title = Wells and Spas Archives | publisher = Jiscmail | date = May 1999 | issue = 46 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230839/http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind9905&amp;L=wells-and-spas&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=4844 | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; which have medicinal springs at their centre, but a variety of smaller sites, and at wells and ritual shafts used for [[Superstition|superstitious]] and sub-religious rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Merrifield, R. (1987) ''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic''. London: Batsford; pp. 23–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stinanswellirvine1.JPG|left|thumb|Saint Inans Well, Irvine, Scotland. Dated 839 AD.]]
Christianity strongly affected the development of holy wells in [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. Aside from the spring that issued from the staff of Moses and the Well of [[Beersheba]], there were already a number of sites mentioned in Jewish  and Christian folklore, including [[Moses]]' well near [[Mount Nebo]], visited by the fourth-century nun [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] and many other pilgrims. St [[Athanasius]]' Life of St [[Anthony the Great|Antony]], written about 356–62, mentions the well created by the desert hermit Antony. It is unclear how many Christian holy wells there may have been, as records are very fragmentary and often a well appears only once, making it impossible to tell when reverence for it began and when it ceased, but by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] England, for instance, probably possessed some hundreds. As they were closely linked with the cults of the saints, many wells in countries that converted to Protestant forms of Christianity fell into disuse and were lost, the Holy Well at [[Walsingham]] ([[Norfolk]]) being a good example, which, having been an integral element of the pilgrimage to the shrine of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the village, vanished completely. Nevertheless, this particular holy well at the [[Anglican Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham]] was restored nearby the original site and its water is known for its [[faith healing|healing]] properties, thus making it a popular site of Christian [[Christian pilgrimage|religious pilgrimage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Philip|title=Streams of Healing Grace|year=2017|publisher=Walsingham Review|language=English |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visiting of wells for therapeutic and entertainment purposes did not completely die out, however, as [[spa]]s became fashionable in the 17th century and later. Eventually [[antiquarians]] (from the 17th century) and folklorists (from the 19th) began to take notice of holy wells and record their surviving traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Rattue, J. (1995) ''The Living Stream'' Woodbridge: Boydell, chapters 7, 8, and 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a hundred holy wells exist in [[Cornwall]], each associated with a particular saint, though not always the same one as the dedication of the church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Jenner|Jenner, Henry]] (1925) "The Holy Wells of Cornwall". In: ''Cornish Church Guide''. Truro: Blackford; pp. 249-257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mabel Quiller-Couch|Quiller-Couch, Mabel]] &amp; Lilian (1894) ''Ancient and Holy Wells of Cornwall''. London: Chas. J. Clark.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several holy wells also survive in [[Turkey]], called ''ayazma'' in [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἁγίασμα}} (''hagiasma''), literally "holiness". Examples of ''hagiasmata'' are found in the [[Church of St. Mary of the Spring (Istanbul)|Church of St. Mary of the Spring]] and the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|Church of St. Mary of Blachernae]], both located in [[istanbul]].

==Historiographical controversies==
The [[Protestant Reformers]] of the 16th century often assumed that medieval Catholic practices embodied lingering remains of [[pagan]] religious practices, and thought of holy wells in that way.&lt;ref name="Carroll2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Michael P.|title=American Catholics in the Protestant Imagination: Rethinking the Academic Study of Religion|date=29 December 2010|publisher=JHU Press|language=English |isbn=9781421401997|page=1878}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affected the outlook of those who came to study holy well traditions later. The pioneers of folklore study took the view that the customs and legends they were recording were debased versions of pagan rites and myths. Thus it became standard to begin any account of holy wells with the statement that the Christian church had adopted them from the pagans and replaced the heathen gods with Christian saints, in order to win people over to the new religion more smoothly.

[[File:Dupath well cornwall.jpg|right|thumb|Dupath Well in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, J. Charles (1912), ''Porches &amp; Fonts.='' London: Wells Gardner &amp; Darton; p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Among the earliest enthusiasts for holy wells in modern times was the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] movement, for whom wells formed part of '[[earth mysteries]]' study along with [[ley line]]s and ancient sites; the view that the Christians had 'stolen' holy wells from the pagan religions fitted in well with their position.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rattue, ''The Living Stream'' (Woodbridge: Boydell), 1995, Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazines ''Wood and Water'' and ''[[Meyn Mamvro]]'', among others, helped shape this approach. During the early- and mid-1990s this viewpoint was under increasing attack crowned by the publication of [[Ronald Hutton]]'s ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'' (1991) which argued that the evidence for what constituted pre-Christian British religious practices, certainly outside Romano-British times, was next to nil.&lt;ref name="Hutton1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV-IQgAACAAJ|accessdate=25 March 2017|year=1991|publisher=B. Blackwell|language=English |isbn=9780631172888}}&lt;/ref&gt; As far as wells themselves were concerned, the controversy emerged in the pages of ''Source'', the holy wells journal edited by Roy Fry and former [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] Tristan Gray-Hulse. A number of articles in the journal challenged long-standing myths about holy well history, and the editors published an exchange between the authors and Cheryl Straffon, editor of Cornish earth mysteries magazine ''Meyn Mamvro'', about the evidence for a particular Cornish well's supposed association with the Irish goddess [[Brigid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.bath.ac.uk/liskmj/living-spring/sourcearchive/ns3/ns3cs1.htm|title=The Search for Bride's Well|website=people.bath.ac.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124142915/http://people.bath.ac.uk/liskmj/living-spring/sourcearchive/ns3/ns3cs1.htm|archivedate=2017-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eco-pagan movement has largely accepted the new historiographical approach,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} but occasionally rather more old-fashioned accounts of holy wells are published, for instance Gary Varner's ''Sacred Springs'' (2002).

A linked argument was over the nature of the influence of the [[Celt]]s on the well cult. The late Francine Nicholson, an independent student of Celtica, argued forcefully and controversially that the Celts had a unique sensitivity to sacred wells, but never elaborated this in any published work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0301&amp;L=WELLS-AND-SPAS&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3&amp;P=2193 WELLS-AND-SPAS Archives - January 2003 (#23)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230605/http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0301&amp;L=WELLS-AND-SPAS&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3&amp;P=2193 |date=2007-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, radically minded scholars have begun questioning the unity of concepts imposed by the term 'holy well'. In a paper in the ''Living Spring Journal'', Jeremy Harte distinguishes between early Anglo-Saxon 'holy wells' and those Christianised in the late Middle Ages, and argues 'apart from being venerated and being wet, they have little in common'; Harte has also stressed that limited evidence may mean that scholars are considerably overestimating the number of holy wells which were active at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0703&amp;L=WELLS-AND-SPAS&amp;P=R924&amp;D=0&amp;H=0&amp;I=-3&amp;O=T&amp;T=0&amp;m=2725 Harte, op.cit.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230613/http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0703&amp;L=WELLS-AND-SPAS&amp;P=R924&amp;D=0&amp;H=0&amp;I=-3&amp;O=T&amp;T=0&amp;m=2725 |date=2007-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival of modern interest==
[[File:St Peter's Well, Houston - view from the east &amp; opening.jpg|thumb|left|250px|St Peter's Well at Houstin in Scotland. A rare Scottish covered well.]]
In a sense, the restoration of holy wells began almost as soon as they were in decline, as a number became the subject of antiquarian interest and some were turned into garden features and put to other decorative uses. However, in more modern times wells have been restored as an expression of interest in the past, sometimes from [[Romanticism|romantic]] or religious motives, but mostly as a statement of continuity with the history of a particular community. A good example is St Osyth's Well at [[West Bierton]] ([[Buckinghamshire]]), 'restored' (and in the process rebuilt completely) by the Parish Council as part of a project marking [[Millennium]] Year in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rattue, ''Holy Wells of Buckinghamshire'' (High Wycombe: Umbra), 2003, pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most active holy wells in Britain are those linked to Christian [[pilgrimages]], at Walsingham, [[Fernyhalgh]] ([[Lancashire]]) and [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] ([[Wales]]), or popular tourist sites (Bath, Somerset). The [[Chalice Well]] at [[Glastonbury]] (Somerset) is at the centre of a [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]]- and [[New Age]]-orientated spirituality and retreat centre. Other wells, however, are often visited on an informal basis for religious or sightseeing reasons. New forms of holy well reverence continue to emerge now and again, notoriously the so-called Well of the [[Triple deities|Triple Goddess]] at [[Minster-in-Sheppey]] ([[Kent]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cassandraeason.co.uk/sacred_waters.htm Sacred waters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607191656/http://www.cassandraeason.co.uk/sacred_waters.htm |date=2007-06-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 Channel 4's archaeological television programme ''[[Time Team]]'' was responsible for exposing the infamous archaeological fraud of [[Llygadwy]], a site which included an alleged holy well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/archive/2001llyg.html Channel 4 – ''Time Team''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227044755/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/archive/2001llyg.html |date=2011-02-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historiographically, the publication of Janet and Colin Bord's ''Sacred Waters'' (1985) was influential in reviving interest in the history and folklore of holy wells in Britain. The same year saw the foundation of the journal ''Source'' by Mark Valentine. Attempts to maintain a regular journal for the study of holy wells have been erratic (''Source'' enjoyed two runs from 1985–89 and 1994–98, and the web-based Living Spring has only had two issues to date) but postings on websites such as The Megalithic Portal show that there is still much interest in this category of ancient site.

==Case study: the necessity of vigilance in preservation of heritage==
Often unmarked on maps and undistinguished by archaeological features, holy wells are a uniquely vulnerable category of ancient site. They continue to be lost to [[farming]], drainage work, development or neglect. A recent instance is the [[desecration]] of St Bridget's Well at Rosepark, Balrothery (County [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]), destroyed by building work in 2003 despite being a protected monument.&lt;ref&gt;Skyvova, P. ''Fingallian Holy Wells''. Swords, Dublin: Fingal County Libraries, 2005, pp. 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; and the destruction of a well at [[Rath Lugh]] during the construction of the [[N3 road (Ireland)|M3 Motorway]] in the [[Gabhra|Tara-Skryne Valley]], Ireland.

The '''Human Terrain System''' ('''HTS''') was a [[United States Army]], [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)]] support program employing personnel from the social science disciplines – such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], regional studies, and [[linguistics]] – to provide military commanders and staff with an understanding of the local population (i.e. the "human terrain") in the regions in which they are deployed.&lt;ref name="HTS website" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ProfBulletin /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forte|first=Maximilian C.|authorlink=Maximilian Forte|title=The Human Terrain System and Anthropology: A Review of Ongoing Public Debates|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2011|volume=113|issue=1|pages=149–153|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;

The concept of HTS was first developed in a paper by [[Montgomery McFate]] and Andrea Jackson in 2005,&lt;ref name=McFate&amp;Jackson&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFate|first=Montgomery|author2=Andrea Jackson|title=An Organizational Solution for DODs Cultural Knowledge Needs|journal=Military Review|date=July–August 2005|pages=18–21|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/milreview/mcfate2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed a pilot version of the project as a response to "identified gaps in [US military] commanders' and staffs' understanding of the local population and culture", such as became particularly visible during the US invasion of [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="HTS website" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFate2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFate|first=Montgomery|author2=Steve Fondacaro|title=Reflections on the Human Terrain System During the First Four Years|journal=Prism|date=September 2011|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://www.ndu.edu/press/reflections-human-terrain-system.html|publisher=NDU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;  HTS was subsequently launched as a [[proof-of-concept]] program, run by the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC), in February 2007, with five HTS teams deployed between Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt; Since 2007, HTS has grown from a program with five deployed teams and a $20 million two-year budget to one with 31 deployed teams and a $150 million annual budget.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; HTS became a permanent US Army program in 2010.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;

Ever since its launch, HTS has been surrounded by controversy.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fattahi|first=Kambiz|title=US Army enlists anthropologists|publisher=BBC News|date= 16 October 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/americas/7042090.stm|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schactman2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Schactman|first=Noah|title='Human Terrain' Chief Ousted|publisher=Wired|date=15 June 2010|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/06/human-terrain-chief-ousted/#more-26041|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the program initially received positive coverage in the US media, it quickly became the subject of heavy criticism – particularly from anthropologists, but also from journalists, military officials and HTS personnel and former personnel.&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt; Most notably, on 31 October 2007, the Executive Board of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) published a statement opposing HTS as an "unacceptable application of anthropological expertise" that conflicted with the AAA's Code of Ethics.&lt;ref name="aaanet.org"&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/pdf/EB_Resolution_110807.pdf American Anthropological Association’s Executive Board Statement on the Human Terrain System Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101015936/http://www.aaanet.org/pdf/EB_Resolution_110807.pdf |date=1 November 2012 }} American Anthropological Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAstatement&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=Statement on HTS|url=http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/statement-on-HTS.cfm|publisher=AAA|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MiddleEastOnline011908"/&gt; Following the publication of a report on HTS by the Commission on Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Services (CEAUSSIC) in 2009,&lt;ref name=Glenn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glenn|first=David|title=Program to Embed Anthropologists with Military Lacks Ethical Standards, Report says|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=3 December 2009|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Program-to-Embed/49344/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|title=Panel Criticizes Military's Use of Embedded Anthropologists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/arts/04anthro.html|accessdate=22 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the AAA released a further statement of disapproval, which they re-iterated in 2012 after rumours that the controversy had died down.&lt;ref name=Hodges /&gt;&lt;ref name=C41SR&gt;{{cite news|last=Albro|first=Robert|title=Comment: Do No Harm|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120425/C4ISR02/304250001/Commentary-8216-Do-no-harm-8217-?odyssey=mod%7Cnewswell|accessdate=16 June 2012|newspaper=C4ISR|date=April 2012|author2= Gusterson, Hugh|agency=Defense News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program evolved into a mechanism for supporting security force assistance. The program ended operations on September 30, 2014.

==Background==
In the most immediate sense, HTS was developed as a response to concerns about mismanagement of US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and, in particular, to the negative effects of recognized "deficiencies" in US military "cultural understanding" of these countries. In 2006 the Human Terrain System was launched by the Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GonzalezA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Roberto|title=Human Terrain: Past, Present and Future Applications|journal=Anthropology Today|date=February 2008|volume=24|issue=1|pages=21–26|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8322.2008.00561.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fawcett&gt;{{cite web|last=Fawcett|first=Grant S.|title=Cultural Understanding in Counterinsurgency: Analysis of the Human Terrain System|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA505497|publisher=Army Command and General Staff Coll Fort Leavenworth KS School of Advanced Military Studies|accessdate=18 June 2012|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, military analysts and academics have also suggested earlier historical contexts for the program's development.

===CORDS: a US military precedent===
A number of military officials have invoked [[Civil Operations and Rural Development Support]] (CORDS) – a counterinsurgency program developed by the US military during the [[Vietnam war]] – as a precedent for HTS.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pilon|first=Juliana Geran|title=Cultural Intelligence for Winning the Peace|year=2009|publisher=[[The Institute of World Politics]] Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-9824888-0-7|pages=|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|144}}&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Carol|title=Military Culture and Education|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9781409407577|pages=29–38 [32]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=56HiId0a84QC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=CORDS+vietnam+Human+Terrain+system+military#v=onepage&amp;q=CORDS%20vietnam%20Human%20Terrain%20system%20military&amp;f=false|editor=Douglass Higbee|accessdate=21 June 2012|chapter=Combat Ethnography}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a foundational article on HTS, a group of military analysts, Kipp ''et al'', described the program as "a CORDS for the 21st Century".&lt;ref name=Kipp&gt;{{cite web|last=Kipp|first=Jacob|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA457490|publisher=Defense Technology Information Center (DTIC)|accessdate=18 June 2012|author2=Lester Grau |author3=Karl Prinslow |author4=Don Smith |date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KippB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kipp|first=Jacob|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century (full document)|journal=Military Review|date=September–October 2006|pages=8–15|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA457490|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MilitaryReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kipp|first=Jacob|title=Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century|volume=4|issue=11|date=September–October 2006|url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their article appraised CORDS as a successful and effective program that was "premised on a belief that the war would ultimately be won or lost not on the battlefield, but in the struggle for the loyalty of the people". Kipp ''et al'' contended that the only major problems with the CORDS program were that it lacked adequate [[Reachback#Defense usage|reachback]] facilities and that it "was started too late and ended too soon".  As such, they argued that it provided "many important lessons" to "guide" the development of HTS as an "effective cultural intelligence program" that could "support tactical and operational-level commanders today".&lt;ref name=KippB /&gt;{{rp|10–11}} By contrast, critics of HTS have drawn attention to the fact that, in Vietnam, CORDS was run in conjunction with the [[Phoenix Program]], which used information gathered through CORDS in its effort to "neutralize" (by means of assassination, infiltration and capture) supporters of the [[Viet Cong]].&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burke /&gt;&lt;ref name=GonzalesInterview&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Counterinsurgency, Anthropology and Disciplinary Complicity|journal=Counterpunch|date=3 February 2009|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/02/03/counterinsurgency-anthropology-and-disciplinary-complicity/|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the concept of "human terrain"===
The concept of "human terrain" has been defined in military documents pertaining to HTS as "the human population in the operational environment ... as defined and characterized by sociocultural, anthropologic and ethnographic data and other non-geographical information".&lt;ref name=KippB /&gt;{{rp|15}} According to Roberto J. Gonzalez (Associate Professor of Anthropology at [[San Jose State University]], and one of the most vocal critics of HTS), this concept can be traced back to a 1968 report by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities|House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) about "the perceived threat of the [[Black Panthers]] and other militant groups".&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt; He argues that the concept gradually gained in popularity and usage, in the military and elsewhere, through the writing of military officials, such as [[Ralph Peters]], and pundits, such as [[Max Boot]].&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;

===History of anthropological engagement with the military===
Commentators on HTS have also drawn attention to the long history of anthropological involvement in military operations in the US and Europe, though for different reasons.  In a 2005 article, [[Montgomery McFate]] (HTS's Senior Social Scientist from 2007 to 2010, and an anthropologist by training) argued that anthropology was born as a "warfighting discipline", having served in its early history as "the handmaiden of colonialism".&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFate2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFate|first=Montgomery|title=Anthropology and counterinsurgency: the strange history of their curious relationship|journal=Military Review|date=March–April 2005|url=http://www.pratiquesciencessociales.net/upload/mcfate2005.pdf |accessdate=18 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813124239/http://www.pratiquesciencessociales.net/upload/mcfate2005.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that anthropology had retreated "into the Ivory Tower" following the Vietnam war, and contended that anthropologists should become involved in developing "military applications of cultural knowledge". [[David Price (anthropologist)|David Price]] (Professor of anthropology and sociology at [[Saint Martin's University]]) also noted that anthropology and warfare have "merged" many times before, but argued that the difference with HTS was that the program had been "clearly identified" as involving activities that betrayed "basic ethical standards for protecting the interests and well-being of studied populations".&lt;ref name=PriceCP2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Human Terrain Systems, Anthropologists and the War in Afghanistan|journal=Counterpunch|date=1 December 2009|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/12/01/human-terrain-systems-anthropologists-and-the-war-in-afghanistan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil L Whitehead]] (Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]) likewise argued that the "collaboration" between anthropological theory and colonial practice was "nothing new", but went on to suggest that this history – and particularly recent developments such as HTS and the [[Minerva Initiative]] – should prompt a critical re-assessment and transformation of anthropological methodology.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=Neil L.|title=Ethnography, Torture and the Human Terrain / Terror Systems|journal=Fast Capitalism|year=2009|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/5_2/Whitehead5_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "cultural turn" in the US Army===
A number of commentators on HTS have described the program as part of a "[[cultural turn]]" in US military policy, particularly pertaining to the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=Derek|title=The Rush to the Intimate: Counterinsurgency and the Cultural Turn|journal=Radical Philosophy|date=July–August 2008|volume=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jager&gt;{{cite book|last=Jager|first=Sheila Miyoshi| authorlink = Sheila Miyoshi Jager| title=On the Uses of Cultural Knowledge|year=2007|publisher=Strategic Studies Institute|location=Washington|isbn=1-58487-330-2|pages=v|url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub817.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilmore&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilmore|first=Jonathon|title=A kinder, gentler counter-terrorism: counter-insurgency, human security and the War on Terror|journal=Security Dialogue|date=February 2011|volume=42|issue=1|pages=25–26|doi=10.1177/0967010610393390|url=http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/42/1/21.abstract|publisher=Sage|format=([[PDF]]), Restricted Access.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gusterson2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Gusterson|first=Hugh|title=Anthropology and Global Counterinsurgency|year=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-42994-6|pages=279–298|url=https://books.google.com/?id=du5kcfUuL9oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=cultural+turn+in+the+u+s+army#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20turn%20in%20the%20war%20on%20terror&amp;f=false|editor=John Kelly|chapter=The Cultural Turn in the War on Terror|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zehfuss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zehfuss|first=Maja|title=Culturally sensitive war?

== History and recent developments ==

===Chronological history of developments in HTS===
The beginnings of HTS can be traced to a pilot proposal for a "Pentagon Office of Operational Cultural Knowledge", published in 2005 by Montgomery McFate and Andrea Jackson.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  In July 2005, the [[Foreign Military Studies Office]] (FMSO) initiated an HTS pilot project (named Cultural Operations Research – Human Terrain System, or COR-HTS), which was headed up by Captain Don Smith, and housed at the Training and Doctrine Command in [[Fort Leavenworth]].&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  The pilot lasted until August 2006.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  In July 2006, [[Colonel]] Steve Fondacaro (retired) was hired by TRADOC to transition the pilot into an active program.&lt;ref name=Schactman2010 /&gt;  In October 2006, Jacob Kipp and colleagues outlined the Human Terrain System in an official FMSO public press release.&lt;ref name=Kipp /&gt;

HTS began recruiting in early 2007.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  In February 2007, the first team was deployed to Afghanistan. Further teams were deployed to Iraq in the summer of that year.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  Originally, HTS project leaders McFate and Fondacaro had planned for the program to run at a small scale (five teams: two in Afghanistan, three in Iraq) for two years.&lt;ref name="McFate2011" /&gt;  However, in response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) from Central Command issued in April 2007, calling for an HTS Team in every Army Brigade and Marine Corps Regiment in Iraq and Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;CENTCOM JUONS dated 7 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Defense Secretary]], [[Robert M. Gates]], authorized a $40 million expansion of the program in September 2007.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geller, Adam, "Odyssey Took Man From Campus to Combat", ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' ([[Associated Press]]), 8 March 2009, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The JUONS demanded a 420 per cent expansion of HTS, from the existing five teams to twenty-six teams divided between Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; McFate and Fondacaro referred to this as a "catastrophic success", meaning that "while the boost from the DOD ([[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]) was gratifying, fulfilling the mandate would stretch a new organization to the limit".&lt;ref name="McFate2011" /&gt;

Following the public statement of disapproval from the AAA, and significant media coverage of the controversy surrounding HTS, the [[United States Congress]] issued an order for an independent assessment of HTS to be undertaken by the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) in September 2009.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt; In May 2010, the [[House Armed Services Committee]] (HASC) temporarily limited the Army's funding obligation towards the program while this assessment was completed. The CNA report, which contained the results of interviews with 19 out of 71 commanders supported by HTS,&lt;ref name=PublicIntelligenceA /&gt; was completed in October 2010.&lt;ref name=CNAR&gt;{{cite web|last=Clinton|first=Yvette|title=Congressionally Directed Assessment of the Human Terrain System|url=http://openanthropology.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/gettrdoc.pdf|publisher=CNA|accessdate=20 June 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently published on the [[Defense Technical Information Center]] (DTIC) website in February 2011, but withdrawn from the website shortly after.&lt;ref name=PublicIntelligenceA&gt;{{cite web|last=Anon|title=Retracted Center for Naval Analyses Assessment of Human Terrain System|publisher=Public Intelligence|date=7 March 2011|url=http://publicintelligence.net/retracted-center-for-naval-analyses-assessment-of-the-human-terrain-system|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, HTS was approved by the US Army and became a permanent Army program.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; In June 2010, [[Maxie McFarland]], the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence at TRADOC, terminated Fondacaro's temporary position as HTS Program Manager.&lt;ref name=Schactman2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberger2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberger|first=Sharon|title='Human Terrain' hits rocky ground|journal=Nature|date=22 June 2010|volume=465|issue=993|doi=10.1038/465993a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100622/full/465993a.html|accessdate=22 June 2012|pages=993|pmid=20577178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonel Sharon Hamilton was appointed as his replacement. McFate also left HTS in 2010.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;

On 8 March 2011, the Center for Complex Operations at the [[National Defense University]] hosted a conference titled Inter-agency Human Terrain Program and Requirements.&lt;ref name=CCO&gt;{{cite web|last=Centre for Complex Operations|title=CCO Event: Interagency Human Terrain Programs and Requirements|date=8 March 2011|url=http://ccoportal.org/event/2011/cco-event-interagency-human-terrain-programs-and-requirements|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center stated that the aims of the conference were to "improve understanding of human terrain information and analysis and of how it is currently being used"; to discuss the "effectiveness" of HTS; and to discuss ethical and legal issues associated with the program.&lt;ref name=CCO /&gt; In June 2011, [[United States Africa Command|AFRICOM]] requested and launched a pilot HTS program.&lt;ref name=ProfBulletin&gt;{{cite journal|last=US Army HQ|journal=Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin|title=Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin: Human Terrain System|date=October–December 2011|volume=37|issue=4|url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/mipb/2011_04.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2012|publisher=US Army Military Intelligence Center of Excellence|id=PB 34-11-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In December 2011, Colonel Hamilton reported that the US Central Command had issued a requirement for an increase of 9 HTS teams in Afghanistan by summer 2012, to bring the total number of teams in Afghanistan up to 31.&lt;ref name=Bertuca&gt;{{cite web|last=Bertuca|first=Tony|title=Army increasing number of Human Terrain Teams; advising allies|url=http://defensenewsstand.com/NewsStand-General/The-INSIDER-Free-Article/army-increasing-number-of-human-terrain-teams-advising-allies/menu-id-720.html|publisher=Inside Washington Publishers|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, HTS officials began prioritizing HTS involvement in "Phase Zero" or, in other words, the earliest, "prevention of conflict" stage of a military campaign.&lt;ref name=McFate2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hodges&gt;{{cite news|last=Hodges|first=Jim|title=Cover Story: US Army's Human Terrain Experts May Help Defuse Future Conflicts|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120322/C4ISR02/303220015/Cover-Story-U-S-Army-8217-s-Human-Terrain-Experts-May-Help-Defuse-Future-Conflicts|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=C4ISR|date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, ''Defense News'' reported that the Director of HTS, Colonel Sharon Hamilton, had been "working on a plan" to expand the use of HTS into other regions such as Africa and Latin America, and was considering whether HTS personnel could be deployed in Mexico to support military counter-narcotic work.&lt;ref name=DNanti-drug&gt;{{cite news|last=Iannotta|first=Ben|title=New tool eyed by U.S. for anti-drug war|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120425/C4ISR01/304250006/New-tool-eyed-by-U-S-anti-drug-war|accessdate=18 June 2012|newspaper=Defense News|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schactman 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schactman|first=Noah|title=Que Curioso!

As part of the ongoing drawdown from Afghanistan in 2013–2014, the Army programmed HTS funding to drop proportionately, eliminating human terrain teams as units were removed from [[Theater (warfare)|theater]]. By September 2014, all HTS teams and personnel had been withdrawn from Afghanistan. Contract and personnel support to the program ceased at the end of the month, effectively ending the program's operations as of 1 October 2014. However, money was still allocated for the program in FY 2015.

===Notable operations===

====Operation Khyber====
During a 15-day operation in the late summer of 2007, 500 [[Afghan army|Afghan]] and 500 US soldiers were deployed to clear an estimated 200 to 250 Taliban insurgents out of [[Paktia Province]], secure southeastern Afghanistan's most important road, and halt a string of [[suicide attacks]] on US troops and local governors. During the operation, an HTS anthropologist, Tracy St. Benoit,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} identified an unusually high concentration of widows in poverty, creating pressure on their sons to join the well-paid insurgents.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Scott|title=US Army's strategy in Afghanistan: better anthropology|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=7 September 2007|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing St. Benoit's advice, US officers developed a job training program for the widows.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; She also interpreted the beheading of a local tribal elder as an effort to divide and weaken the [[Zadran (Pashtun tribe)|Zadran]], rather than as a more general attempt at intimidation. As a result, Afghan and US officials focused on uniting the Zadran, one of southeastern Afghanistan's most powerful [[tribe]]s, as a way of hindering the Taliban's operations in the area.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

====Operation Maiwand====
800 Afghan soldiers, 400 US soldiers and 200 Afghan policemen took part in Operation Maiwand, in which Afghan soldiers raided houses of suspected militants.&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;''International Herald Tribune'', [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/03/asia/AS-GEN-Afghan-Army-Operation.php Afghan army plans, executes first big operation, taking step forward in US exit strategy], 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607094440/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/03/asia/AS-GEN-Afghan-Army-Operation.php |date=7 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' reported that in one [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] village, [[Kuz Khadokhel]], the Human Terrain Team (HTT) made it possible for negotiator Captain Aaron White to understand [[body language]] in the context of the culture, to identify leaders during negotiations, and to reinforce a perception of leadership by not conferring with fellow officers and by demonstrating good faith through projects facilitated by the Ghazni [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]] (PRT), which included roads, a visit by the PRT's [[field hospital|mobile medical clinic]], the construction of a deep well for irrigation, and the beginnings of a road to Afghanistan's main [[Highway 1 (Afghanistan)|Highway 1]].&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"/&gt;

===Deaths===
[[Michael V. Bhatia]], a member of HTT AF1, was killed along with two other soldiers by an [[Improvised explosive device|IED (Improvised Explosive Device)]] while riding in a [[Humvee]] in [[Khost]], Afghanistan in May 2008.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geller|first=Adam|title=Professor Pays Ultimate Price in Country He Loved|newspaper=''[[Arizona Republic]]''|publisher=([[Associated Press]])|date=9 March 2009|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2009/03/08/20090308dangerous-onlinePART2.html|page=1|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geller /&gt;

On 4 November 2008, HTS member Paula Loyd was fatally injured whilst surveying the village of [[Chehel Gazi]] with a US Army platoon. She was doused with gasoline disguised in a jar of cooking oil and lit on fire by Abdul Salam, an Afghan national. Loyd was severely burned over 60 percent of her body.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|110}} Salam was captured by Don.

===End of the HTS===
With the end of major American presences in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a shift towards electronic data collection, the need for HTS became less apparent.  On 30 September 2014, funding ended for the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/06/29/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-human-terrain-system/ The Rise and Fall of the Human Terrain System]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and organizational structure==
[[File:Human terrain teams.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Human Terrain Team at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|An HTS senior seminar leader provides feedback to Human Terrain Teams at [[Fort Leavenworth]] in May 2010]]

=== Role of HTS in the US Army ===
HTS is defined as an "intelligence enabling capability",&lt;ref name=ProfBulletin /&gt;{{rp|1}} and is categorized as "Intelligence support activity".&lt;ref name=HTSFAQs&gt;{{cite web|last=HTS|title=HTS website – FAQs|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/htsFAQ.aspx|publisher=HTS|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the HTS website, the aim of the program is to "provide sociocultural teams to commanders and staff" in the US Army in order to "improve the understanding of the local population", and to "apply this understanding to the [[Military Decision Making Process]] (MDMP)".&lt;ref name="HTS website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Terrain System|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/Default.aspx|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website also argues that the program was designed to address an identified "operational need" in the US Army for "sociocultural support".&lt;ref name=HTSBackground&gt;{{cite web|last=HTS|title=HTS website – Background|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/htsAboutBackground.aspx|publisher=HTS|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HTS components===
HTS has two main components: an institutional component referred to as the "Army Enduring Base", and an operational component referred to as "Deployed Teams".&lt;ref name=HTSComp&gt;{{cite web|last=HTS|title=HTS Components|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/htsComponentsDeployed.aspx|work=HTS website|publisher=www.army.mil|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both components include numerous sub-divisions.

====Army Enduring Base====

=====Project Office=====
The Project Office is based in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] and is composed of the Director, the Deputy Director, and Project staff (including human resources, social scientists, knowledge management, and [[information technology]] (IT) teams).&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Reachback Research Center (RRC)=====
The RRC is a [[Contiguous United States#CONUS and OCONUS|Continental United States (CONUS)]]-based research and analysis program that provides support to deployed HTTs, HTATs, and TCEs.  It is made up of a combination of social scientists, military analysts and civilian analysts who are organized into teams that specialize in research in a particular geographical region.  RRC personnel are responsible for supplying information from [[Open-source intelligence|open source]] and classified sources to deployed HTS teams, and for continuously updating HTS databases.&lt;ref name=KippB /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====HTS training=====
HTS training is based at [[Fort Leavenworth]] in [[Kansas]]. Training focuses on field research methods, staff planning and procedures, and equipment training.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

====Deployed teams====

=====Human Terrain Teams (HTT)=====
Human Terrain Teams (HTT) work at the brigade or regimental level of the US Army. They undertake research among the local population, and represent that population (referred to as the "human terrain") in the various stages of military operations: planning, preparation, execution, and assessment.&lt;ref name="MiddleEastOnline011908"&gt;
{{cite news| title = U.S. Military, Oblivious of Iraqi Culture, Enlists Anthropologists for Occupation| publisher = Middle East Online| date = 19 January 2008| accessdate = 11 February 2008| url = http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/74326/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Human Terrain Teams contain 5–6 members and consist of a Team Leader, who is a principal adviser and is responsible for the entire team; one or two Social Scientists, who are responsible for conducting and managing ethnographic and social-science research for the brigade staff's area of operations; one Research Manager, who is responsible for integrating the HTT's research into their military unit's intelligence collection effort and interacting with other agencies and organizations; and one or two Human Terrain Analysts, who have specific local knowledge and act as the primary human terrain data researcher.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|149–50}}&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morin|first=Monte|title=Cultural advisers give US teams an edge|journal=Stars and Stripes|date=28 June 2007|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/cultural-advisers-give-u-s-teams-an-edge-1.65900|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt; HTTs are responsible for providing a constantly updated, user-friendly ethnographic and socio-cultural database of the area of operations that comprises data maps showing specific ethnographic or cultural features; raising points on cultural or ethnographic issues of specific concern to the unit commander; and sustaining a connection with RRC.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|150}}

=====Human Terrain Analysis Teams (HTAT)=====
Human Terrain and Analysis Teams provide support to echelons of the US Army that are above brigade or regimental level (e.g., [[Division (military)|division]] or regional command).&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;  They form a part of the Commander's staff and are responsible for analyzing the information provided by HTTs in order to support the Commander's Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt; HTATs are made up of one Team Leader, one or two Social Scientists, one or two Research Managers, and one or two Human Terrain Analysts.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Theater Coordination Elements (TCE)=====
TCEs are made up of a mixture of military and civilian staff. They are responsible for providing sociocultural support to the military staff and commanders of a particular operational region or theater.  A TCE comprises one Team Leader, three Social Scientists, one or two Research Managers, and one or two Human Terrain Analysts.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Theater Support Office (TSO)=====
TSOs are responsible for providing administrative and logistics support to HTTs in a particular operational region or theater.  They are made up of one Theater Support Officer and a variably-sized support team.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Social Science Research and Analysis (SSRA)=====
SSRA is responsible for liaising with indigenous polling organizations and [[Small and medium enterprises|small or medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs) in order to gather data and information from the local population.  This information is then passed on to the TCE.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

===Methods===
The HTS program focuses on mapping the "human terrain" (i.e. the local population in an area in which military are deployed). In order to do this, HTTs create databases of information about local leaders, tribes or social groups, political disputes, economic issues, and social problems. This information is then analyzed by HTATs, used to advise military staff and commanders, and used to inform the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR" /&gt; Collected data is compiled and stored in a larger archive in order to be accessible for the military and other government agencies.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|150}}

===Equipment===
HTS has developed the MAP-HT Toolkit, an integrated software suite provided to HTTs for data visualization and reporting.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|150}}&lt;ref name="MilitaryReview"/&gt;  This includes software for mapping (of the spatial distribution of social groups, for example), and for producing link charts (of power structures and social networks in informal economies, for example) and timelines.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulrine|first=Anna|title=The Culture Warriors|newspaper=US News and World Report|date=30 November 2007|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/iraq/2007/11/30/the-pentagon-deploys-social-scientists-to-help-understand-iraqs-human-terrain.html|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Components in the toolkit include: ANTHROPAC, UCINET, Axis PRO, [[i2 Limited|i2]] [[Analyst's Notebook]], and TerraExplorer, a 3D earth visualization application provided by Skyline Software Systems.

===Funding===
The initial funding for the Human Terrain System came from the [[Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization]] (JIEDDO).&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=John|authorlink=John Stanton (journalist)|title=General David Patraeus' Favorite Mushroom: Inside the U.S. Army's Human Terrain System|year=2009|publisher=Wiseman Publishing|location=|isbn=978-90-8963-019-3|pages=189|oclc=677926603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} The JIEDDO funding of $20 million, granted in the summer 2006, supported the pilot HTS project from mid-2006 to 2007.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; Following the Central Command JUONS request for the major and rapid expansion of HTS in April 2007, the Defense Secretary approved a $40 million expansion of HTS to be funded by the Department of Defense (DOD).&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"/&gt;  DOD provided HTS funding until 2009 when funding responsibilities were assumed by Army [[Staff (military)#Continental Staff System|G2]] (i.e., the Army's Military Intelligence budget).&lt;ref name=Hodges /&gt; In 2009 it was reported that the annual budget for the program was $143 million.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christian|first=Caryl|title=Human Terrain Teams|journal=Foreign Policy|date=8 September 2009|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/09/08/reality_check_human_terrain_teams?page=0,0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 the HASC temporarily limited the funding obligation to HTS until the Army submitted an assessment of the program that addressed concerns that had been raised.&lt;ref name=Forte2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Forte|first=Maximilian|title=Human Terrain System Criticized by US Congress|url=http://zeroanthropology.net/2010/05/21/human-terrain-system-criticized-by-u-s-congress/|publisher=zeroanthropology.net|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, McFate stated that HTS had a $150 million annual budget.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;

==Public debate: praise, criticism and controversy==

===Praise and support===

====US government officials====
In a speech in 2008, [[Robert Gates]] (US Defense Secretary) praised HTS, saying that although the program had experienced early "teething problems" the "net effect" of HTS efforts was often "less violence across the board, with fewer hardships and casualties among civilians as a result".&lt;ref name=Jaschik&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|title=A Pentagon Olive Branch to Academe|journal=Inside Higher Ed|date=16 April 2008|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/04/16/minerva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 article on HTS in the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[David Rohde]], an American journalist who has twice won the [[Pulitzer Prize]], reported that one of the first HTTs to be deployed in Afghanistan had received "lavish" praise from officers for "helping them see the situation from an Afghan perspective and allowing them to cut back on combat operations".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; He wrote that HTS had also been praised by Afghan and Western civilian officials in the area, although they had been "cautious about predicting long term success".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Rohde also cited Colonel David Woods (Commander of the 4th Squadron of the [[73rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|73rd Cavalry Regiment]]) as having remarked: "Call it what you want, it works ... It works in helping you define the problems, not just the symptoms."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

In a statement to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2008, Colonel Martin Schweitzer, Commander of the 4th [[Brigade Combat Team]] of the [[82nd Airborne Division]], claimed that HTS capabilities had reduced his unit's "kinetic operations" in Afghanistan by 60–70 per cent within a year.&lt;ref name=Schweitzer&gt;{{cite web|last=Schweitzer|first=Martin P.|title=Statement of Colonel Martin P.

The US media has reported a number of positive review from HTS employees.  In 2008, ''World Politics Review'' ran a feature article on David Matsuda (a former professor of anthropology at [[California State University]]) who described HTS as "the chance to change the nature of warfare, the chance to anthropologize the military – and not the other way around – the chance to lessen casualties, avoid conflict, take people through the post-conflict to peace".&lt;ref name=McLeary&gt;{{cite news|last=McLeary|first=Paul|title=Human Terrain Teams|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/2774/human-terrain-teams?page=2|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=World Politics Review|date=14 October 2008|format=.

====In the media====
In 2006, [[George Packer]], author of ''The Assassin's Gate: America in Iraq'' and ''New Yorker'' magazine staff writer, wrote an article about the increasing use of social science in US military operations and the early trials of the HTS program. He reflected: "At a moment when the Bush Administration has run out of ideas and lost control, it could turn away from its "war on terror" and follow a different path – one that is right under its nose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Packer|first=George|title=Knowing the Enemy|newspaper=New Yorker (magazine)|date=18 December 2006|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/12/18/061218fa_fact2#ixzz1bytdTVKw|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a (mainly critical) book about HTS entitled ''David Petraeus's Favorite Mushroom: Inside the US Army's Human Terrain System'' (2009), [[John Stanton (journalist)|John Stanton]] stated that HTS had been successful in advising a US military unit in Iraq on proper mealtime etiquette, i.e., not only how to properly eat, but also the gestures during the meal, and especially how to observe the Ramadan feast.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

===Criticism and controversy===

====American Anthropological Association====
{{quote box

On 31 October 2007, the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) published a statement opposing HTS as an "unacceptable application of anthropological expertise".&lt;ref name="aaanet.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AAAstatement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MiddleEastOnline011908"/&gt; The statement argued that HTS personnel would have responsibilities to the U.S military working in war zones that would conflict with anthropologists' duty, as outlined in the AAA Code of Ethics (Section III, A, 1), to "do no harm to those they study".&lt;ref name=AAAstatement /&gt; It further maintained that, working in a war zone, HTS personnel would be unable to ensure the "voluntary informed consent (without coercion)" of those whom they communicate with, as is also required by the AAA Code of Ethics (Section III, A, 4).&lt;ref name=AAAstatement/&gt;

In December 2008, the AAA Executive Board followed up their initial statement of disapproval by asking the Commission on Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Services (CEAUSSIC) to thoroughly review the HTS program.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt; CEAUSSIC's "Final Report on the Army's Human Terrain Proof-of-Concept System" was released in December 2009.&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR&gt;{{cite book|last=CEAUSSIC|title=Final Report on the Army's Human Terrain System Proof of Concept Program |year=2009|publisher=AAA|url=https://www.box.com/shared/kg8t2cop82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CEAUSSIC|title=Final Report on the Army's Human Terrain System Proof of Concept Program |date=14 October 2009|url=http://www.policyscience.net/CEAUSSIC_HTS_Final_Report.pdf|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEAUSSIC's 74-page report argued that the "goals" and "basic identity" of HTS were characterized by "confusion", and that the program was designed to simultaneously perform multiple tasks that were "potentially irreconcilable"; e.g., serving as research function whilst also operating as "a source of intelligence" and a "tactical function in counterinsurgency warfare".&lt;ref name=Glenn /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR /&gt; It added that this confusion would make it unclear to anthropologists whether they could follow the Code of Ethics or not.&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR /&gt; The commission further maintained that HTS personnel would be unable to "maintain reliable control" over the information they collected, and that there was a "significant likelihood" that HTS data would be used "as part of military intelligence", which would place "researchers and their counterparts in the field in harm's way".&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR /&gt; It also noted that if HTS were a research organization, "it would be required to comply with federal law for subject protection" and suggested that it was "unusual" that the program had avoided oversight by an [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB).&lt;ref name=Zehfuss /&gt; In conclusion, the report stated: "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic features of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology". It recommended that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with [[Anthropology|anthropological]] disciplinary ethics and practice.&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICreport&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=CEAUSSIC Releases Final Report on Army HTS Program|url=http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/CEAUSSIC-Releases-Final-Report-on-Army-HTS-Program.cfm|publisher=AAA|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the AAA restated their disapproval of the HTS program after a cover story article in [[C4ISR Journal|''C4ISR'']] (a ''[[Defense News]]'' publication) claimed that "the controversy ha[d] cooled" and that HTS would have a recruiter at the annual AAA meeting in November that year.&lt;ref name=Hodges /&gt;&lt;ref name="C41SR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAblog&gt;{{cite web|last=AAA blog|title=Anthropologists and the Human Terrain System|url=http://blog.aaanet.org/2012/04/25/anthropologists-and-the-human-terrain-system/|publisher=AAA|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAA denied both claims.&lt;ref name=C41SR /&gt;

====Anthropologists====
In 2007, the [[Network of Concerned Anthropologists]] (NCA) was founded by a group of anthropologists, largely in response to the HTS program.&lt;ref name=JacksonMIT&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Jean|title=Anthropologists Express Concern Over Government Plan to Support Military Research|journal=MIT Faculty Newsletter|date=May–June 2008|volume=20|issue=1|url=http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/205/jackson.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCAWebsite&gt;{{cite web|last=Network of Concerned Anthropologists|title=NCA website|url=https://sites.google.com/site/concernedanthropologists/|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Network wrote an "Anthropologists' Statement on the Human Terrain System Program" to the [[United States House of Representatives]], which was signed by over 700 anthropologists.&lt;ref name=GustersonBAS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gusterson|first=Hugh|title=Do Professional Ethics Matter in War?|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=March 2010|url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/do-professional-ethics-matter-war|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement called for Congress to halt governmental support to HTS and cancel plans for its expansion, giving the following reasons: "There is no evidence that HTS is effective"; "HTS is dangerous and reckless"; "HTS wastes taxpayers money"; "HTS is unethical for anthropologists and other social scientists".&lt;ref name=NCAWebsite /&gt;

Roberto J. Gonzalez (Associate Professor of Anthropology at [[San Jose State University]]), [[Hugh Gusterson]] (Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at [[George Mason University]]), and [[David Price (anthropologist)|David Price]] (Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at [[Saint Martin's University]]) – three of the founding members of NCA – have all written numerous articles criticizing HTS as an effort to "weaponize anthropology". In a 2010 article, Gusterson wrote of the program: "The Pentagon seems to have decided that anthropology is to the war on terror what physics was to the [[cold war]]".&lt;ref name=GustersonBAS /&gt;  He criticized HTS for performing "drive-by research" as well as violating disciplinary ethics, arguing that the AAA Code of Ethics is comparable to the [[Hippocratic oath]]: "Asking an anthropologist to gather intelligence that may lead to someone's death or imprisonment ... is like asking an army doctor to kill a wounded insurgent".&lt;ref name=GustersonBAS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Flintoff&gt;{{cite web|last=Flintoff|first=Corey|title=Marines Tap Social Sciences in Afghan War Effort|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125502485|publisher=NPR|accessdate=25 June 2012|date=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Price has described HTS as part of a "[[neocolonialism|neocolonial]]" mission.&lt;ref name=PriceCP2009 /&gt; "Human Terrain System", he maintained, "is not some neutral humanitarian project, it is an arm of the US military and it is part of the military's mission to occupy and destroy opposition to US goals and objectives ... HTS's goal is a gentler form of domination".&lt;ref name=PriceCP2009 /&gt; In an article in ''[[CounterPunch|Counterpunch]]'' in April 2009, Price disputed Colonel Schweitzer's claims that HTS had reduced kinetic action by 60–70%, reporting that his efforts to track the studies (via the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]) on which these statistics were based resulted in Schweitzer's admission that there were no such studies and that the statistics were a "loose estimate".&lt;ref name=counterpunch.com /&gt;  In the same article, Price also criticized the coverage of HTS in the US media and published a list of ten fundamental issues that reporters needed to address.&lt;ref name="counterpunch.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Counterinsurgency's free ride|journal=Counterpunch|date=7 April 2009|url=http://www.counterpunch.com/price04072009.html |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026015533/http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/04/07/counterinsurgency-s-free-ride/ |archivedate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper from 2009, [[Neil L Whitehead]], Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], questioned whether HTS can work in the way that it is promoted to do.  Drawing on anthropological studies of warfare that demonstrate the socially transformative effects of warfare and military action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=R. Brain|title=War in the Tribal Zone: Expanding States and Indigenous Warfare|year=2000|publisher=School of American Research Press|isbn=0933452802|author2=Neil L. Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead argued that the practice of anthropology becomes "highly problematic" in a situation where anthropology is being deployed to report on "the very phenomenon it is a part of changing, whether consciously or not".&lt;ref name="Whitehead 2009"/&gt; He therefore suggested that ethical objections to HTS are not limited to the anthropologist's potential violation of their duty of confidentiality and responsibility to their informants, but also include the questionable "ethical responsibility" of those anthropologists and military planners "erroneously" promoting HTS as being able to work in ways that "in all likelihood" cannot actually work, thereby "endangering anthropologists and soldiers alike".&lt;ref name="Whitehead 2009"/&gt;

Other anthropologists who have criticized HTS include [[Marshall Sahlins]], who describes HTS as "manipulating local culture, imposing [our government's objectives] on them, transforming anthropologists into spies, and putting people you work with [in the locale] at risk"; and Maximilian Forte, who has published numerous articles on HTS in academic journals and on internet websites.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacobsen&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobsen|first=Kurt|title=Are we there just to help the Army aim better?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/may/13/internationaleducationnews.highereducation|accessdate=24 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteZA&gt;{{cite web|last=Forte|first=Maximilian C.|title=Max Forte|url=http://zeroanthropology.net/about-the-bloggers/max-forte/|publisher=Zeroanthropology.net|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military officials and former HTS personnel====
In 2009, Major Ben Connable ([[Marine Corps]]) published an article in ''[[Military Review]]'' which argued that HTS was "undermining" the US Army's "cultural competence".&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt;&lt;ref name=Connable&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connable|first=Ben|title=All our Eggs in a Broken Basket: How the Human Terrain System is Undermining Sustainable Military Cultural Competence|journal=Military Review|date=March–April 2009|pages=57–64|url=http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20090430_art010.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of former HTS personnel have also criticized the program. In 2007, social scientist Zenia Helbig was fired from HTS after raising concerns that the program was disorganized and provided insufficient region-specific training.&lt;ref name=WeinbergerN2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberger|first=Sharon|title=Military Research: The Pentagon's Culture Wars|journal=Nature|date=October 2001|volume=455|pages=583–585|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081001/full/455583a.html|doi=10.1038/455583a|accessdate=25 June 2012|issue=7213|pmid=18833247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SchactmanZH&gt;{{cite news|last=Schactman|first=Noah|title=Army Social Scientists Calm Afghanistan, Make Enemies at Home|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/11/human_terrain?currentPage=1|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=Wired|date=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HelbigAAA&gt;{{cite news|last=Helbig|first=Zenia|title=Personal Perspective on HTS: Address to AAA Conference (.doc)|url=https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/files/aaa_helbig_hts.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2012|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Matt Tompkins, an HTT Leader, remarked that defense contractors supporting HTS were not providing sufficient training or staffing, and that the social scientists on his team lacked region-specific expertise.&lt;ref name=WeinbergerN2012 /&gt; After resigning from the program in 2010, John Allison criticized HTS for its doctrinal inflexibility and lack of openness to anthropological perspectives and suggestions for improvement.&lt;ref name=Price2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Human Terrain System Dissenter Resigns, Tells Inside Story of Training's Heart of Darkness|journal=Counterpunch|date=15 February 2010|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2010/02/15/human-terrain-systems-dissenter-resigns-tells-inside-story-of-training-s-heart-of-darkness/|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NDU Study====
In June 2013, a team of four researchers from the US [[National Defense University]] in Washington, DC published an in-depth assessment of HTS and the HTTs in Afghanistan, entitled ''Human Terrain Teams: An Organizational Innovation for Sociocultural Knowledge in Irregular Warfare''.&lt;ref name="Lambbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamb|first1=Christopher|last2=Orton|first2=James Douglas|last3=Davies|first3=Michael C.|last4=Pikulsky|first4=Theodore T.|title=Human Terrain Teams: An Organizational Innovation for Sociocultural Knowledge in Irregular Warfare|year=2013|publisher=Institute of World Politics Press|location=|isbn=978-0988864207}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first publicly released book with a history of the program as well as an assessment of the teams in the field. The study's conclusions were also published in ''Joint Force Quarterly'' in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Christopher|title=The Way Ahead for Human Terrain Teams|url=http://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=739537|publisher=NDU Press|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study emerged from the [[Project for National Security Reform]] and its flagship assessment of the US national security system, [[Forging a New Shield]]. The study interviewed 87 individuals in a total of 105 interviews. The participants were principally team members, with commanders (primarily Brigade- and Task Force-level commanders) being the core variable able to define effectiveness of the team under their command. HTS program managers, knowledgeable defense-related persons, and some Iraq team members were interviewed.&lt;ref name="Lambbook"/&gt;{{rp|157}} In researching the program's history, the study's authors found that the relationship between HTS and the Army's [[Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) was one of the primary reasons for the problems within the program. Decisions made about HTS by TRADOC, such as new personnel contracts, had a negative impact on the program. However, the lack of a theory of performance in the beginning by HTS, and the lack of continual assessments of the teams in the field by HTS, meant that the program managers lacked the knowledge to train and deploy effective HTTs.

The authors also point out that the study's assessments strongly agree with the conclusions of earlier studies conducted by faculty at [[West Point]], the [[Center for Naval Analyses]] (CNA), and the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA). All four studies concluded that the program suffered from multiple problems in its creation and implementation, which inhibited the effectiveness of the teams in the field. Yet, all agree that a high majority of commanders were extremely supportive of the teams and found them effective.&lt;ref name="Lambbook"/&gt;{{rp|175–176}}

The NDU study was different in that it categorized the commanders' assessments according to basic concepts of "Cultural Awareness" (Description), "Cultural Understanding" (Explanation), and "Cultural Intelligence" (Prediction). It was found that most commanders only found and used their HTTs at the first level, Awareness. Some of the better performing HTTs could offer Understanding. Only a few HTTs, the very high performing teams with highly effective individuals, held a strong sense of teamwork and were commanded by culturally aware units and commanders. If commanders did not care about cultural issues, which did occur in some cases, the team would have no impact regardless of the team's effectiveness in other circumstances.

Finally, the nature of the intelligence architecture in Afghanistan was seen as the issue that had the biggest impact on HTT performance. Because the intelligence architecture did not value sociocultural knowledge and was not built to provide it, HTTs themselves had to be the ground sensors, a role they had not been designed to fulfill. HTTs were intended to be the aggregators of knowledge at the Brigade level to synthesize information to commanders directly. If HTTs had been built to be the sensors, they would have had to be multiplied in size and number many times over. By utilizing the HTTs as the primary interviewers and data analysts, their effectiveness was constrained. Since HTT members had relatively short tours (9–12 months), and would usually have a new Brigade arrive in the middle of their tour, their effectiveness was further reduced by their constant need to train new units on area features. The NDU team concluded that had soldiers themselves been the primary sensors on the ground, as recommended in LTG [[Michael T. Flynn]]'s ''Fixing Intel'' monograph, HTTs would have better been able to perform the role they were originally intended to serve.&lt;ref name="Flynnbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flly|first1=Michael T.|last2=Pottinger|first2=Matthew|last3=Batchelor|first3=Paul D.|title=Fixing Intel|year=2010|publisher=Center for a New American Security|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NDU book ends by suggesting that HTS be turned over to the [[U.S. Army Special Operations Command]] (USASOC). There were a number of reasons the team suggested USASOC would be a better fit for HTS: TRADOC had been a prime cause of multiple programmatic problems for HTS throughout its history; the US military has a history of intentionally forgetting and deinstitutionalizing cultural programs; and the future operating environment would be utilizing Special Operations forces to a greater degree than regular Army/Marines units.

====In the media====
[[Ann Marlowe]] wrote a piece about HTS for the ''Weekly Standard'' in November 2007, stating that "there are some things the Army needs in Afghanistan, but more academics are not at the top of the list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marlowe|first=Ann|title=Anthropology Goes to War|newspaper=The Weekly Standard (magazine)|date=26 November 2007|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/15464 |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural references===
In 2010, [[James Der Derian]], David Udris, and Michael Udris released a documentary film about HTS entitled ''[[Human Terrain: War Becomes Academic]]''.&lt;ref name=HTSmovie&gt;{{cite web|last=Der Derian|title=Human Terrain the Movie|url=http://humanterrainmovie.com/|accessdate=24 June 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDb&gt;{{cite web|last=IMDb|title=Human Terrain (2010)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632527/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacLeish&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacLeish|first=Kenneth|title=Is Empathy a Weapon?|journal=Anthropology Now|date=September 2011|volume=2|issue=1|pages=90–96|format=[[JSTOR]]|postscript=Restricted Access|jstor=3738032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Middup&gt;{{cite journal|last=Middup|first=Luke|title=James Der Derian, David Udris and Michael Udris, ''Human Terrain: War Becomes Academic'' – A Review|journal=Journal of American Studies|year=2011|volume=45|doi=10.1017/S0021875811001228|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=8432766&amp;jid=AMS&amp;volumeId=45&amp;issueId=04&amp;aid=8432764|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been described as having two main narrative components: the first is an inquiry into the HTS program and its history; the second is a narrative of the "tragic" story of [[Michael Bhatia]]'s involvement in HTS.&lt;ref name=Middup /&gt;  The film features interviews with numerous individuals who have played an important role in the history of HTS and the public debate surrounding the program, including Michael Bhatia, Steve Fondacaro, Roberto Gonzalez, Hugh Gusterson, and Montgomery McFate.

The number of Indian students studying abroad rapidly increased by 163% between 1999 and 2006 to reach 145,539 as compared to slower growth of 25% between 2006 and 2013 to reach 181,872, according an analysis of UNESCO data. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choudaha|first=Rahul|date=March 2017|title=Three waves of international student mobility (1999-2020)|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RmnCsexL7ZckFpR1FXVFFQZ2M/view|journal=Studies in Higher Education|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1080/03075079.2017.1293872|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Students of Indian origin are [[Student migration|traveling]] in higher numbers than ever before to pursue [[higher education]] abroad. Nearly 85% of internationally mobile Indian students head for five countries—the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}—but China and Germany are both emerging destinations for Indian students heading abroad, though the numbers heading for Germany are still relatively small. In 2006, of the 123,000 studying outside India, 76,500 chose the US, followed by the UK; in 2001 India overtook China as the source of the largest number of foreign students in the United States.

After peaking in 2009, the number of Indian students studying in Australia fell following racial attacks; by 2015 the number had risen to exceed the 2009 number.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; During 2013-14, 34,100 Australian visas were issued to Indian students, a rise of 38% as compared to the previous year.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

As of 2014-15, there are approximately 11000 Indian students studying in Germany, comprising 4.9% of international students in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iie.org/Services/Project-Atlas/Germany/International-Students-In-Germany#.WKn1nFeVuk0|title=Project Atlas|website=www.iie.org|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers are rising. German universities have started offering several master's programs in English, attracting Indian students.

==Other major destinations==
Nearly 85% of internationally mobile Indian students head for five countries: the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, but in addition to Germany, China, Ukraine, Russia and Georgia are some emerging destination for Indian students heading abroad.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Romania and Ukraine has also emerged as a destination for Indian students of medicine as the education system is regulated under the [[European Union]] and is of a higher quality than in the countries of the former USSR quality is relatively better compared to Ex-USSR, China, and the Philippines.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Many Indian students are also opting for higher education in the Netherlands because of the high quality of education, availability of more than 2,000 courses taught completely in English, and access to the European Union including career opportunities after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32317">'''International''' or '''global psychology''' is an emerging branch of [[psychology]] that focuses on the worldwide enterprise of psychology in terms of communication and networking, cross-cultural comparison, [[scholarship]], practice, and pedagogy (Stevens &amp; Gielen, 2007). Often, the terms international psychology, global psychology, and cross-cultural psychology are used interchangeably, but their purposes are subtly and importantly different: Global means worldwide, international means across and between nations, cross-cultural means across cultures. In contrast, the term “multicultural” is more often used to refer to ethnic and other [[Cultural identity|cultural differences]] existing within a given nation rather than to global or international comparisons.

== Definitions and scope==
International psychology is concerned with the emergence and practice of psychology in different parts of the [[world]] (Stevens &amp; Gielen, 2007). It advocates committed involvement in worldwide and regional psychology and policy-making organizations such as the [[International Union of Psychological Science]] (IUPsyS includes 87 national psychology associations and more than 20 international/regional associations), the International Association of [[Applied psychology|Applied Psychology]] (IAAP), the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP), the [[icpweb.org|International Council of Psychologists]] (ICP), the European Federation of Psychologists’ Associations (EFPA: it includes 36 national psychology associations), the Sociedad Interamericana de Psicología (SIP), the recently founded Pan-African Psychological Union (PAPU), and others. In addition, there exist more than 100 international psychology organizations each focusing on a specific subdiscipline. The goal is to establish psychology as a global discipline that in its theories, research practices, applications, and ethical aspirations is focused on the psychological study of humanity as a whole while avoiding as much as possible ethnocentric biases and preoccupations (McCormick &amp; Constantable, 2015; Stevens &amp; Wedding, 2004). For an annotated bibliography on international psychology that covers 156 publications, see Takooshian, Gielen, Rich, and Velayo (2016). 

In contrast, the term “global psychology” is more frequently used to refer to the worldwide investigation of global issues and phenomena from a  psychological and psychocultural point of view. Examples include the investigation of subjective well being, identification and treatment of [[mental health]] problems, the psychological dimensions of family systems, [[gender role]]s and gender-typed behavior, [[childrearing]] practices, cognitive and emotional functioning, international attitudes, [[value system]]s, intergroup conflicts, threats to the natural environment, societal transformation and national development, the struggles of disempowered groups (such as women, children, immigrants, and refugees) as seen in a global perspective (Stevens &amp; Gielen, 2007).

Cross-cultural psychology may be defined as the comparative study of behavior and mental processes in different cultures. It aims to measure the psychological phenomena across cultures and looks for patterns, generalizability, and culture-specific differentiation (Shiraev &amp; Levy, 2013). An example would be the investigation of child-rearing practices and their psychological consequences among distinctly different groups.  Cross-cultural psychology focuses on the relationship between psychology and culture (such as language, traditions, predominant values, and socialization practices) and how it affects individual human functioning. In this respect, cross-cultural psychology constitutes one important element of global psychology. Cross-cultural psychology emerged during the 1960s-1970s as a separate [[Science|field of study]] with a definite identity; it is thus older than the more general field of international psychology, which is only now emerging as a distinct discipline.

[[The Oxford English Dictionary]] (1993) defines global as, “…pertaining to or involving the world, worldwide” (p.&amp;nbsp;1101) and international as, “Existing, occurring, or carried on between nations…Agreed on by many nations; used by, or able to be used by (the people of) many nations” (p.&amp;nbsp;1397). At present the term international psychology is in wider use although Stevens and Gielen (2007) prefer the term global psychology, to underline the increasingly global nature of psychological phenomena and problems together with their [[Scientific method|scientific investigation]] and efforts to ameliorate them. More generally, the emergence and intensification of an international psychology movement is part and parcel of the broader process of globalization in the scientific, economic, technological, sociocultural, political and ecological spheres. It reflects and makes use of the increasingly global flow of information, ideas, and peoples. In addition, globalization in psychology has led to the ''de facto'' use of English as the predominant means of communication so that academics in many parts of the world are now expected to read and publish in English-language journals.

It should be added that international psychology, global psychology, and cross-cultural psychology share the common goal of making psychology more universal and less ethnocentric in character. Because American psychologists dominated the field of psychology especially in the decades after World War II, they frequently ignored contributions from other parts of the world and claimed, whether explicitly or implicitly, that their theories, concepts, ethical standards, and empirical findings applied to all—or at least most—people around the world. In addition, because they largely ignored books and journals not written in English, American psychology became a largely monocultural and monolinguistic discipline (Draguns, 2001). Consequently, it is a key goal of internationally oriented psychologists both in the US and elsewhere to turn psychology into a more universally and less culturally biased discipline that contributes to human welfare everywhere while strengthening "world consciouness" rather than ethnocentric and potentially violent forms of nationalism or extremist religious preoccupations (Leong, Pickren, Leach, &amp; Marsella, 2012). Practical advice about how to internationalize the teaching of psychology can be found in the handbook by Rich, Gielen, and Takooshian (2017).

== Foci ==
Major foci of international psychology include:

* The worldwide study of psychological processes and phenomena (e.g., Gielen, 2016; Hofstede, 2001).
* Macro-level interventions and policy making, for example, international efforts to reduce [[HIV|HIV infections]] based on psychological research (Wessells &amp; Dawes, 2007), to assess and reduce ethnic conflicts (Landis &amp; Albert, 2013), and to further global mental health (Patel, Minas, Cohen, &amp; Prince, 2014).
* Micro-level interventions, for example, counseling and psychotherapy, [[school psychology]], and interventions in organizations (e.g., Aycan, Kanungo, &amp; Mendonça, 2014; Moodley, Gielen, &amp; Wu, 2013; Pedersen, Lonner, Draguns, &amp; Trimble, 2015).
* International networking and international psychology organizations and conferences, such as IUPsyS, IAAP, IACCP, EFPA, SIP, APA’s Division 52 – International Psychology, APA's Office of International Affairs, and the [[Institute for International and Cross-Cultural Psychology]] (IICCP) (Merenda, 1995).
* Supporting efforts to internationalize psychology education by infusing global, international, and cultural perspectives into the curriculum, providing international and cross-cultural training experiences, increasing international faculty and student exchange, and forming collaborative research programs (Heine, 2016; Leong et al., 2012; McCarthy, Dickson, Cranney, Trapp, &amp; Karandashev, 2012; Rich &amp; Gielen, 2015; Rich, Gielen, &amp; Takooshian, 2017; Takooshian, Gielen, Plous, Rich, &amp; Velayo, 2016). 
* Rewriting the [[history of psychology]] from a global and less ethnocentric point of view, together with corresponding changes in the curriculum (Baker, 2012; Brock, 2007; Leong et al., 2012; Rich &amp; Gielen, 2015; Takooshian, Gielen, Plous, Rich, &amp; Velayo, 2016).
* Establishing shared training standards, professional regulations, and codes of [[ethics]] (Pettifor, 2007; Leach, Stevens, Lindsay, Ferrero, &amp; Korkut, 2012), such as the Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists (2008), which has been adopted by the IUPsyS and its 87 national member organizations (Leach, Stevens, Lindsay, Ferrero, &amp; Korkut, 2012).
* Representing psychology at the United Nations especially in the context of non-governmental organizations (NGO's). An important step in this regard was taken in 2012, when The Psychology of NGOs Accredited at the United Nations (PCUN) was established by a group of psychology-based NGOs. These NGOs advocate for the inclusion of psychological perspectives, research, and practice, for instance when formulating and implementing the UN's [[Sustainable Development Goals]].
*Based in part on the advocacy of psychologists such as Judy Kuriansky, Chair of the Psychology Coalition of NGOs at the United Nations, mental health and well-being have for the first time been included in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Supported by the World Bank Group and the World Health Organization (2016), mental health specialists are now succeeding in moving mental health issues from the periphery closer to the center of worldwide efforts to improve global health.

==History==

Modern scientific psychology had an international dimension from its beginnings in the late 19th century. [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832-1920), for instance, the father of modern experimental psychology, supervised approximately 190 doctoral students from at least 10 countries. Similarly, the First International Congress of Physiological Psychology in 1889, in [[Paris]], included more than 200   participants from 20 countries (Sabourin &amp; Cooper, 2014). Although psychology developed first in [[Europe]], it soon began to prosper in the [[United States]] as well. Altogether, modern scientific psychology remained a predominantly western enterprise till well after [[World War II]] although modern psychology was already present in the early 1900s some in nonwestern countries such as India, Japan, and Mexico. During the 1930s many prominent psychologists from Germany and Austria emigrated to the United States. As a result of these developments, psychology in the United States assumed worldwide leadership, but also grew increasingly monocultural, monolingual, and ethnocentric in character (see David and Buchanan, 2003, and Bullock, 2012, for timelines of important events in the history of international psychology). However, there is now an increased awareness among U.S. psychologists that U.S. psychology must take into account global developments in order to fully represent the world of psychology. For instance, the [[American Psychological Association]] established in 1997 an International Psychology Division (Division 52), which currently has about 600 members.

During the last three to four decades, especially, psychology has expanded worldwide and assumed a global presence. Stevens and Gielen (2007) and some others have estimated that there are over one million psychologists.  This estimate is based on local definitions of what it means to be a professional psychologist: in most countries the prerequisite is a [[Master's degree]] or Diploma in psychology, whereas in others (e.g., Brazil) a professionally oriented [[Bachelor’s degree]] that incorporates a period of supervised practice enable one to gain admission to a licensing examination. The global estimate includes well over 320,000 psychologists in Europe, at least 250,000 in Latin America, and 225,000 in the United States. The country with the highest density of psychologists is Argentina. In addition, psychology has gained ground in East and [[Southeast Asia]] and is increasingly visible in [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim countries]] such as [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], and [[Lebanon]] (Ahmed &amp; Gielen, 1998; Baker, 2012; Stevens &amp; Wedding, 2004). In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], psychology is well developed in [[South Africa]], but less present though expanding in the other regions.  For more detailed information, see the edited volume by Stevens and Wedding (2004) which  includes analyses of the status of psychology in 27 [[countries]] located on all inhabited [[continents]]. The handbook by Baker (2012) reviews the respective histories of psychology in 27 countries and regions around the world while the volume by Rich and Gielen (2015) focuses on 17 past and present pathfinders in the realm of international psychology. The contributions respectively to Moodley, Gielen, and Wu (2013) and Gerstein et al. (2009) analyze the status of counseling psychology and psychotherapy in numerous countries.

In general, psychology as a discipline has prospered in well-to-do, urbanized, and individualistic countries and cultures but it is frequently considered an unnecessary luxury in the poorer and more rural regions of the world where the treatment of physical health problems by modern healthcare workers and indigenous healers is likely to take precedence over the identification and treatment of [[mental health]] problems (Leung &amp; Zhang, 1995; O'Gorman, Shum, Halford, &amp; Ogilvie, 2012). Such problems are frequently treated by indigenous healers who tend to rely on supernatural explanations for their identification and treatment. However, a global mental health movement that has been strongly influenced by psychiatrists is gathering steam. This makes it likely that in the future, greater resources will be allocated to mental health problems especially in medium-income countries (Patel et al., 2014). Countries where psychology is both influential and especially well developed include The Netherlands, Switzerland, Israel, Germany, USA, United Kingdom, Australia, Indonesia, Austria, the Scandinavian countries, and Argentina (especially psychoanalysis).

== Trends ==

Perhaps the best measure of trends within international psychology is within its organizations, through new membership, conference topics, and cooperative research across borders. For example, the International Union of [[Psychological science|Psychological Science]] (IUPsyS) has seen an increase of new member countries from [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]], and [[Latin America]] in the past 15 years; membership in such organizations represents a desire and need in these countries for networking, training, accreditation, expansion of scientific research, and international recognition (Stevens &amp; Gielen, 2007). Correspondingly, international psychology conferences are now increasingly taking place in both Western and non-Western countries. IUPSyS's quadrennial International Congresses of Psychology (ICP), for instance, have been and will be taking place in Beijing (2004), Berlin (2008), Cape Town (2012), Yokohama (2016), and Prague (2020). Similarly, the quadrennial Congresses of Applied Psychology offered by IAAP, the largest international psychology organization for individual members, have taken or will take place around the globe in cities such as San Francisco (1998), Singapore (2002), Athens (2006), Melbourne (2010), Paris (2014), and Montreal (2018).

Trends in global psychology point to the sustained growth, specialization, and feminization of psychology, and the emergence of contextually sensitive paradigms.

The number of psychologists, psychology students, and psychology programs worldwide continues to grow steadily, proving that one of the goals of globalization is being met.  However, much work still needs to be done to bring psychology to underdeveloped areas, and to increase the resources and development of the field in countries where it has already taken hold (Adair &amp; Kağitçibaşi, 1995; Stevens &amp; Wedding, 2004).

Specialization is a growing trend, with each nation focusing specializations on its own needs and goals. Also, communication within these specializations is being facilitated through the [[World Wide Web]] and the emergence and growth of specialized [[international organization]]s and journals in subfields of psychology. Although access to the Internet is frequently still limited in [[Developing country|low-income countries]], it has nevertheless improved considerably in recent years thus facilitating the exchange of scientific and professional information as well as research data. The ''Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology'', for instance, is increasingly publishing papers by large teams of international psychologists that compare psychological phenomena across numerous countries located on all inhabited continents. Moreover, high impact psychological journals published in North America and Europe have broadened their scope by increasingly accepting articles by international and non-Western authors including those residing in East Asian countries. 

Feminization in psychology is another trend, as women are beginning to dominate the field in Europe, Latin America, Canada, the United States, and parts of Asia. A trend within this trend is the continued dominance of male psychologists within business and academia, whereas women tend to work more frequently in school, counseling, and clinical settings.

Finally, with the globalization of psychology comes the demand for more culturally sensitive paradigms (Heine, 2016). Traditionally, psychology was taught in the Western context, reflecting the norms, values, and data of those particular regions. Increasing awareness that this psychology does not sufficiently address culturally specific as well as global issues and therefore does not fully apply to some cultures has led to the call for indigenous psychologies, or at least an alternative psychology to the mainstream, reductionistic paradigm which may be applied to most, if not all, cultures (Kim, Yang, &amp; Hwang, 2006). Prominent centers of [[indigenous psychology]] include Mexico, the Philippines, [[South Korea]], and Taiwan. Moreover, the increasing inclusion of globally collected data of psychological relevance is gradually undermining the traditionally ethnocentric nature of psychology as taught in the United States and elsewhere in the West (e.g., Hofstede, 2001). Theoretically, indigenous psychologists emphasizing culturally sensitive paradigms tend to see themselves as cultural rather than as cross-cultural psychologists.

== Professional regulations and ethical standards ==

Many countries around the world have professional regulations for the practice of psychology. “With some exceptions, the existence of professional regulation reflects the level of development of professional psychology in that country. A profession needs to establish an identity and credibility before there is something to be regulated” (Pettifor, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;312). In the 36 European countries represented in EFPA, a major effort is underway to unify the basic academic curriculum as well as other requirements underlying the training and certification of psychologists. These countries have established specific yet wide ranging guidelines for a European [[Diploma]] in Psychology comparable to a Master’s level [[Higher education|university education]] of six years duration that includes supervised practice. The diploma will enable psychologists trained in one country to practice in other European countries and is likely to influence the education and practice of psychologists in other parts of the world as well.

Countries that currently have limited or no regulation of the profession include [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Kuwait]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]] and [[Turkey]]. Several of these countries are working toward licensing legislation, and several have developed ethical standards of practice to guide.
Many national psychology associations have adopted a [[Ethical code|code of ethics]] such as, for instance, APA’s Ethical Principles of Psychologists and [[Code of Conduct]]. EFPA has adopted several codes of ethics in recent years, and the five [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) adopted a unified code of ethics in 1988, which they revised in 1998 to be more consistent with EFPA’s meta-code (Pettifor, 2007). Moreover, IUPsyS and IAAP adopted, in 2008, a Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists. Such codes and declarations tend to be aspirational in nature.

== Conclusion ==

The scope of scientific psychology and its practice have expanded enormously from its early beginnings in the 19th century to today. This holds true for all post-industrial countries and increasingly for some modernizing nations such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Turkey. In contrast, psychology remains much less visible in the poorer countries and especially so in their rural areas. The expansion of psychology into the nonwestern world has led to an increasing awareness of the role of cultural factors in psychological functioning together with repeated calls to “indigenize” psychology (Kim, Yang, &amp; Hwang, 2006). International contacts among psychologists as well as joint research and applied projects across national and geographic boundaries have prospered thanks to the rapidly evolving technologies of transportation and  [[Telecommunication|electronic communication]]. Consequently, one may safely predict that the cross-cultural, global, and international dimensions of psychology will become more prominent in the foreseeable future.

==Plot==
{{plot|date=October 2015}}
Cleo ([[Rowan Blanchard]]) is a teenage girl living in the shadow of her older sister, Molly ([[Paris Berelc]]), whose popularity gets her recognized by everyone at school. Although Cleo is hardly noticed compared to her sister, she is an excellent student, but is introverted and somewhat sarcastic and cynical.

Cleo's science teacher, Mr. Perkins (Alex Désert), sees her potential in science and decides she needs a challenge for her class project; she is to determine a mystery substance and transform it into its crystal state. As she works on the experiment at home, while Molly hosts a dinner for her lacrosse team, a moth flies by and distracts Cleo, causing her to accidentally spill unknown chemicals into her solution. The steam produced ends up turning the moth invisible, leading Cleo to chase it around the house, full of guests, before it gets away.

Later, while Molly is preparing for bed, the moth returns, attracted to the light from the bathroom. The moth falls into a cup of water containing an antacid Molly is about to drink, and she unknowingly consumes the moth which renders her invisible.

The next morning, Molly is horrified when she cannot see herself and discovers the reason from Cleo. She must attend school to participate in the season opener for her lacrosse team, which college scouts will be watching. As it is Halloween, she decides to wear her costume to mask her invisibility, but when the costume also turns invisible, Molly has Cleo wear the costume and pretend to be her at school. Cleo attends the pep circle for the lacrosse team while Molly grabs a microscope from the science classroom so Cleo can figure out how to make her visible again. In the process, Molly hears Carter (Will Meyers), a boy Cleo likes, talking with George ([[Karan Brar]]) about Cleo; she manages to secure a date for her sister by pretending to be her and asking Carter out. Things get complicated when George finds out Molly's invisibility, and her boyfriend Coug (Austin Freyberger) questions why she is constantly avoiding him. Later in the lacrosse game, Cleo has a rough start but slowly gets into the game with Molly's help, resulting in a victory for the team.

Upon observing Molly's cells under the microscope, Cleo and George conclude that her invisibility will become permanent unless they can formulate an antidote before midnight, twenty-four hours after Molly swallowed the moth, so they need to reproduce the results from Cleo's earlier experiment. The sisters go to a cemetery to catch another moth while George goes to school to set up. While in the cemetery, Molly's frustration over her invisibility mounts, leading to a heated argument with Cleo. In apologizing, Cleo admits to admiring Molly's "light" and is jealous because her not sharing in it makes her feel invisible. After Molly secures a moth for the experiment, the sisters take a trolley to school. While in transit, Molly tells Cleo she understands her feeling invisible, but she also envies Cleo's genius, as she knows her popularity is fleeting. Cleo clarifies to Molly that her "light" is about more than popularity.

When they arrive at school and meet George, they realize they need to get past the security guard. Using her invisibility, Molly manages to scare him out, allowing Cleo and George to enter and duplicate Cleo's original experiment. The solution turns out to be too complex for either Cleo or George to understand, and they need Carter, a governor's scholar, to analyze the results.

They look for him at the school's annual Halloween party "Romp the Swamp". While searching, Cleo bumps into Coug, who is doubting his relationship with Molly and needs to be shown she cares for him, despite being invisible. Eventually, Cleo finds Carter, who is upset with her mixed attitude, expecting they would be together for the party. After informing him about the situation, she takes him to a nearby barn, where her sister, Coug and George are gathered.

With time running short, Cleo, George, Carter and Coug work together to develop an antidote for Molly, narrowly making the midnight deadline. They nearly get in trouble when Mr. Perkins, in charge of the party, finds them in the barn, but Molly informs him about Cleo's experiment before drinking the antidote, risking the deadline. When she finally gets to the antidote, it fails but not because it passed midnight. Molly had taken some antacid the night before when she consumed the moth, so after Cleo adds a dose of that to the antidote, Molly becomes visible again upon drinking it.

Astonished by the results of Cleo's project, Mr. Perkins asks her to present her findings at a seminar of the New Orleans Association of Applied Scientists. Cleo gains a greater appreciation for the fine line between visible and invisible.

'''Lastikman''' originally spelled '''Lastik Man''' is a fictional character and [[Philippine comics|Filipino comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Mars Ravelo]] and artist Mar T. Santana. Lastikman or the original spelling of '''Lastik Man''' debuted in comics format - certainly in ''[[Aliwan Komiks]]'' #56 (December 7, 1964). Based and patterned from DC Comics' [[Plastic Man]], and/or Marvel's [[Mister Fantastic]], Lastikman can also stretch, transform and into many imaginable forms and shapes he desires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video48.blogspot.com/2008/05/pinoy-superheroes-of-60s-5-first.html PINOY SUPERHEROES OF THE 60s #5: THE FIRST LASTIKMAN] video48&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early years (1964-1965)===
This Mars Ravelo fictional character was first spotted in [[Aliwan Komiks]] in 1964. His name was derived from the English word "elastic," which means "flexible and stretchable." His claim to fame was his ability to stretch parts of his body, and reshape himself into whatever form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pep.ph/spotlight/looking-back/13675/The-Birth-of-Pinoy-Superheroes/1/2 The Birth of Pinoy Superheroes] pep.ph&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1965 comic book of Aliwan Komiks ''"Lastik Man Vol. 1"'', Lastik Man is introduced as a new comic book superhero, an alien from another planet who somehow got trapped on earth. Lastikman then decided to fight crime in the Philippines, mainly Manila.

===Later years (1995-1997)===
In the mid-1990s, Aliwan's publisher [[Graphic Arts Service, Inc.]] (GASI) brought back the character in a new series of stories by various writers and artists. For this revival, Lastikman was given a new costume and, for the first time, a secret identity, that of scientist Dr. [[Manuel De Lastico]]. 

====1995 Issue #1====
The feature was apparently so successful that GASI decided to spin off Lastikman into his own magazine. One of the Philippines' greatest superheroes would also find himself at death's door. And it happened in the very first issue of his new comic book. The first issue #1 of the new Lastikman Komiks was released on September 28, 1995. 

However, it seemed as though success had gone to the checkered champion's head. In the first ''Issue #1: "Color of Death"'' (written by Almel de Guzman and illustrated by Arnel Coronel), the once-noble hero has become boastful and arrogant, much to the dismay of his once-adoring public. 

One day, an old soothsayer warns Lastikman of his impending doom. Naturally, the proud hero laughs the prophecy off. Soon after, [[Blaab]], an alien from the planet [[Thufpox]], threatens to move the Earth a few degrees from its orbit because it's blocking the [[radiowave]]s vital to his new intergalactic weapon, the [[Cyberbeam]]. At first, Lastikman doesn't take the alien runt seriously. But once Blaab makes good on his threat, causing several natural disasters in the process, the prideful protector is forced to take action. 

Lastikman first takes on Blaab's bulky minion [[Megan]], who manages to twist and bend him out of shape, but the elastic egotist eventually succeeds in keeping his opponent under wraps. And to prove just how big a jerk he has become, Lastikman shows blatant reckless disregard by hurling his defeated foe towards an oncoming plane. 

Next up to challenge our hero is [[Frikton]], who looks like an evil teaspoon with arms and legs. As expected, Lastikman underestimates his new foe, which turns out to be a fatal mistake. Frikton transforms into a super-heated ball that causes the swell-headed hero's body to melt (It also causes him to scream like a girl. Rather undignified way for a hero to go). And with that, Lastikman kicks the bucket. Or rather, oozes right into it. 

Detaching from his liquefied remains, Lastikman's spirit ends up in Limbo. There, he is confronted by the [[League of Pinoy Superheroes]], whose members include a big muscular guy with a barbell and a woman with stars on her bra. Standing trial before a jury of his peers, Lastikman is judged guilty of the sin of pride. The fallen hero shows remorse for his arrogance and pleads for a chance to redeem himself. The jury of heroes exercises leniency, combining their powers to restore Lastikman back to life. 

When Lastikman returns to action, he flies through the air by turning his ears into little-bitty wings. The resurrected Lastikman eventually defeats the alien invaders and emerges from this adventure with a renewed sense of humility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pinoysuperheroesuniverse.blogspot.com/2010/08/death-of-lastikman.html The DEATH of LASTIKMAN] pinoysuperheroesuniverse&lt;/ref&gt;

====1995 Issue #3====
In ''Issue #3: "Playground"'' (October 12, 1995), Lastikman faces the mad toymaker [[Professor Gilmor]]. Abused as a child, the brilliant but twisted genius came to believe that grown-ups are the root of all evil in the world, and aims to exterminate all adults with his murderous high-tech toys. 
A recurring villain, Professor Gilmor menaced Lastikman anew in issue #9. 

====1995 Issue #4====
In ''Issue #4: "Gold"'' (October 19, 1995), a chunk of gold recovered from the planet "There" turns out to be a shape-shifting alien lifeform. Though not necessarily hostile (unless provoked), it nonetheless causes a panic when it wanders into the city. It turns out that all the lonely gilded visitor wanted was a little love, which it finally finds in the arms of a bronze statue. 

====1995 Issue #5====
In ''Issue #5: "Lastikman vs [[Taong Putik]]"'' (translated from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] as Lastikman vs Mud Man) (October 26, 1995), while most of the other writers depicted Lastikman as a traditional bland do-gooder type, Mike Tan (co-creator of such series as [[Trigger 2000]] and [[Kampeon]]) imbued him with more of a personality and a sense of humor. After a botched chemical plant heist, one of the frustrated thieves throws a chemical canister into a boggy creek. Sometime later, a man falls into the contaminated water and emerges transformed into a massive mud-encrusted monster with heat vision. By coincidence, the man behind the mud happened to be secretly in love with Dr. Manuel De Lastico/Lastikman's girlfriend Cecile. Sure enough, the lovesick lump of loam cuts in on his rubbery rival for the fair damsel's affections. 

====1995 Issue #6====
In ''Issue #6: "Pyrona"'' (November 2, 1995), Dr. De Lastico finds an injured young woman on his doorstep. He nurses her back to health for over a week, after which the recovered girl abruptly decides to leave his care. Soon after, industrial plants are being attacked by a flame-powered villainess named [[Pyrona]]. Obviously, Pyrona and the mysterious girl Dr. De Lastico treated earlier are one and the same. Eventually, Pyrona realizes that her opponent Lastikman is none other than the kind doctor who helped her. Anyway, Pyrona reveals that her actions were not altogether malicious. She's actually a fugitive from another planet who crashed to Earth while trying to escape her world's authorities. A rebel leader opposed to the modernization of her homeworld at the expense of its environment, she sees the Earth treading a similar destructive path and decided to take drastic action, as misguided as her method may be. 

====1995 Issue #7====
In ''Issue #7: "Earthquakes" (November 9, 1995), an evil dwarf named [[Gummo]] awakens from a 100-year sleep. Enraged to see towering skyscrapers in place of his beloved forest home, he causes a devastating earthquake that lays waste to an entire city, and threatens to do the same to every city in the nation. 

====1995 Issue #8====
In issue #8: "Creatura"'' (November 16, 1995), as the story opens, we learn that Lastikman does not age. His girlfriend Cecile decides to break up with him, concerned that she would someday look old enough to be his mother while he stays forever young. The heartbroken hero then takes his frustrations out on the bad guys. Meanwhile, a crippled orphan named Bobet is befriended by a giant sea monster, which he names [[Creatura]]. But although friendly, the continued pollution of its water habitat eventually drives Creatura to go on a destructive rampage. Of course, the creature isn't the real villain of the story, but rather the unscrupulous chemical plant owner responsible for the pollution. 

====1995 Issue #10====
In ''Issue #10: "Dzuteh"'' (November 30, 1995), Lastikman battles the dark forces of Dzuteh, a Tibetan sorcerer who seeks an ancient book containing the secret of eternal life. Dzuteh succeeds in finding the lost book. But the big twist in the story is what that book turns out to be—The Holy Bible. 

====1995 Issue #11====
In ''Issue #11: "Lastikman Versus Babaeng Kidlat"'' (Lastikman Versus Lightning Woman) (December 7, 1995), Lastikman's powers are mysteriously fading. To find out what the problem is, he examines himself in the laboratory of his secluded spaceship deep in the mountains of Sierra Madre. Meanwhile, a "cosmic spirit" comes to Earth and inhabits the body of a female mountaineer, becoming [[Thundra]], the Lightning Woman. Swearing vengeance against Cosmo, the Space Gladiator who destroyed her previous body, she drains all the electricity in the vicinity, causing a massive blackout that affects even the power supply of Lastikman's ship. 

Unable to restore his powers, Lastikman gets so depressed that HE ACTUALLY CONSIDERS KILLING HIMSELF. Fortunately, it never comes to that. His ship's emergency energy reserves kick in, and he discovers that his body is low on the "foreign matters" that give him his shape-shifting abilities. Once a special machine on his ship replenishes those foreign matters in his body, Lastikman is finally able to take on the lethal Lightning Lady. 

====1995 Issue #13====
In ''Issue #13: "Spektro"'' (December 21, 1995), [[Spektro]], the self-proclaimed God of Mirrors, has been kidnapping beautiful young women, sucking them through the looking glass and into his mirror dimension. Among the victims are movie star [[Minona Roder]] and supermodel [[Isabella Mosollini]]. Lastikman manages to prevent the abduction of another victim by disguising himself as her bedsheet. 

====1995 Issue #14====
In ''Issue #14'' (December 28, 1995), the final issue featured 2 Lastikman stories. The first story "Versus" introduced Versus, a criminal from Lastikman's native planet [[Zorak]] who was imprisoned in a mirror and sent adrift into outer space. Entering the Earth's orbit, shockwaves from the French nuclear tests cause the mirror to shatter, releasing the alien prisoner. Versus eventually discovers that he possesses shape-shifting abilities on Earth. And just as any extraterrestrial supervillain would do, he decides to use his powers to take over the world. This naturally brings him into conflict with Lastikman who just happens to be the son of Versus' jailer. The second tale "Cyberman" has Lastikman going up against a cyborg bodyguard gone rogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pinoysuperheroesuniverse.blogspot.com/2010/08/lastikman-1995-test-post.html LASTIKMAN 1995] pinoysuperheroesuniverse&lt;/ref&gt;

====1996-1997 #Issues====
Following the cancellation of his book, Lastikman went back to the pages of Aliwan Komiks, running for 2 more years from 1996 to 1997.

Lastikman would be absent from the comics scene for about 8 years, but would remain in the public consciousness thanks to 2 movie adaptations (the 2002 film starring Vic Sotto and the 2004 version with Mark Bautista), followed by the 2007-08 TV series starring Vhong Navarro.

In the 2003 movie version, Young Hilario is near a rubber tree when a meteor strikes it, and somehow gains powers of elasticity. His grandfather inspires him to use his newfound powers to do good deeds, and thus honour the memories of his dead parents. Hilario grows up to become a Professor in physics, and also the superhero Lastikman.

In the 2004 movie version, Young Adrian - a lanky teenager whose father became a drunkard after the death of his mother - was mauled to death by illegal loggers whom he prevented from cutting the trees in the forest. He was left lifeless under a rubber tree, which revived him and gave him special power.

===The Mango Comics miniseries (2004)===
Just in time to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Mars Ravelo's fantastic, elastic creation, [[Mango Comics]] is proud to bring Lastikman back to the pages of comics in full color. Lastikman Issue #1 is a special 56-page one-shot comic that reinvents Mars Ravelo's popular elastic superhero. It pays homage to the original story of one of the country's most popular superheroes. The story details the arrival of Lastikman on Earth, as he's chased by an invading force from his home planet. The story re-images characters from the original series, such as Don Rufo, Vinya, and Toto, as well as introduces Mango Comics' first original superhero, Atomika. It was made possible in part through generous contributions to the Support Filipino Comics Program. Created in 1965, Lastikman comes to life through the writing of acclaimed comic book creator and inker [[Gerry Alanguilan]] ([[Wasted (comics)|Wasted]], [[Superman: Birthright]]), the art of two-time [[National Book Award]] winner [[Arnold Arre]] (Mythology Class, [[Trip to Tagaytay]]), and the brilliant colors of the talented [[Edgar Tadeo]] ([[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]], [[Silver Surfer]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mangocomics.com/ Lastikman] Mango Comics website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabayancentral.com/onlyindphil/lastikman.html LASTIKMAN COMICS]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004 comic, Lastikman crashed on Earth and lost all of his memory. He then decided to fight crime and later in the comic book he found out that he was a lesser experiment of an alien species called Lastomorphs, humanoids with the powers of elasticity.

For the moment, Lastikman's comic book career is once more dormant. But the character remains familiar and popular even to the current generation, so it is perhaps only a matter of time until he comes back for another stretch.

==Costume==
The Ravelos commissioned Bong Leal to re-design LASTIKMAN's costume for the 2007 TV series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guhits.blogspot.com/2009/03/lastikman.html Lastikman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Lastikman was given the ability to mimic the form and elasticity of rubber. He can stretch and reshape his body in any way he desires. While he usually retains the checkered colors of his costume in whatever shape he takes, he can change from his costumed incarnation into his normal human self with any clothes at will, and apparently could look like anyone he desires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writeups.org/fiche.php?id=5200 Lastikman v1.3] writeups.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art and literature ===
''Lastikman Komiks'' was a 5-Star Komiks Magasin published by Graphic Arts Service, Inc. Edited by Vic Soriano, it was published from September 28 – December 28, 1995. Its title was based on [[Mars Ravelo]]'s original character Lastikman, who first appeared in the pages of ''Aliwan Komiks''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://komiklopedia.wordpress.com/2007/08/30/lastikman-komiks/ Lastikman Komiks] KOMIKLOPEDIA: The Philippine Komiks Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lastikman Komiks'' ran weekly for 14 issues. A typical issue featured a 15-page Lastikman story and three 5-page back-up strips: 2 of these were Turbogirl and Lastikdog, while the remaining spot was occupied by the alternating strips "Amazing Amazons" and "The Raptors." [[Sonny Trinidad]] served as regular cover artist.

Lastikdog who, while not a Ravelo creation, is affiliated with one of his greatest heroes. Lastikdog first appeared in 1995 in the pages of Lastikman Komiks, and later in Aliwan Komiks. The series was written by Jeffrey Marcelino Ong, with art by Larry Santiago and Zer Hipolito. Trojan was an intelligent pet dalmatian owned by Dr. Manuel De Lastico, who also happened to be the superhero Lastikman. One day, while his master was away, Trojan spotted a passing pickup truck carrying a female dog at the back. Infatuated, Trojan follows the truck to the house of an eccentric scientist named Professor Pakto. As the dogs were playing, Trojan knocked over a container of chemicals that the professor was working on. He then proceeded to drink the chemical that spilled on the floor. The formula gave Trojan shape-shifting abilities similar to those of his master's. He would go on to follow in his owner's footsteps, using his newfound powers to fight evil as Lastikdog. All the while, Lastikman is totally unaware of his pet's crime-fighting activities! There's a point in the series where Lastikman becomes jealous and insecure with his pet Trojan. However, they eventually agreed to fight bad guys together. Unfortunately, Lastikdog died in the end after rescuing a baby Dalmatian from a burning establishment.

[[File:Siegfried leitmotif.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Leitmotif associated with Siegfried's Horn Call in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera, [[Siegfried (opera)|''Siegfried''.]] [[File:Siegfried's Horn Call.wav|thumb]]]]

A '''leitmotif''' or '''leitmotiv''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|aɪ|t|m|oʊ|ˈ|t|iː|f}} is a "short, constantly recurring [[phrase (music)|musical phrase]]"&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Kennedy (1987), ''Leitmotiv''&lt;/ref&gt; associated with a particular person, place, or idea. It is closely related to the musical concepts of ''idée fixe'' or motto-theme.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Kennedy (1987), 366&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling ''leitmotif'' is an anglicization of the [[German language|German]] ''[[wikt:Leitmotiv#German|Leitmotiv]]'' ({{IPA-de|ˈlaɪtmoˌtiːf|IPA}}), literally meaning "leading motif", or perhaps more accurately, "guiding motif". A [[motif (music)|musical motif]] has been defined as a "short musical idea&amp;nbsp;... melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic, or all three",&lt;ref&gt;Drabkin (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; a salient recurring [[Figure (music)|figure]], musical fragment or succession of notes that has some special importance in or is characteristic of a [[musical composition|composition]]: "the smallest structural unit possessing [[theme (music)|thematic]] identity."&lt;ref&gt;White (1976), p.&amp;nbsp;26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, such a motif should be "clearly identified so as to retain its identity if modified on subsequent appearances" whether such modification be in terms of [[rhythm]], [[harmony]], [[orchestration]] or accompaniment. It may also be "combined with other leitmotifs to suggest a new dramatic condition" or development.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Warrack (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is notably associated with the [[opera]]s of [[Richard Wagner]], and most especially his ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', although he was not its originator and did not employ the word in connection with his work.

Although usually a short [[melody]], it can also be a [[chord (music)|chord]] [[Chord progression|progression]] or even a simple [[rhythm]]. Leitmotifs can help to bind a work together into a coherent whole, and also enable the composer to relate a story without the use of words, or to add an extra level to an already present story.

By association, the word has also been used to mean any sort of recurring theme, (whether or not subject to developmental transformation) in [[literature]], or (metaphorically) the life of a fictional character or a real person. It is sometimes also used in discussion of other musical genres, such as instrumental pieces, cinema, and [[video game music]], sometimes interchangeably with the more general category of ''theme''.

==Classical music==

===Early instances in classical music===
The use of characteristic, short, recurring motifs in orchestral music can be traced back to the early seventeenth century, such as [[L'Orfeo]] by [[Monteverdi]]. In French opera of the late eighteenth century,  (such as the works of [[Gluck]], [[André Grétry|Grétry]] and [[Étienne Méhul|Méhul]]), "reminiscence motif" can be identified, which may recur at a significant juncture in the plot to establish an association with earlier events. Their use, however, is not extensive or systematic. The power of the technique was exploited early in the nineteenth century by composers of Romantic opera, such as [[Carl Maria von Weber]], where recurring themes or ideas were sometimes used in association with specific characters  (e.g. Samiel in ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' is coupled with the [[chord (music)|chord]] of a [[diminished seventh]]).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The first use of the word ''leitmotif'' in print was by the [[critic]] [[Friedrich Wilhelm Jähns]] in describing Weber's work, although this was not until 1871.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Motifs also figured occasionally in purely instrumental music of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period. The related idea of the musical ''idée fixe'' was coined by [[Hector Berlioz]] in reference to his ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' (1830). This purely instrumental, programmatic work (subtitled Episode in the Life of an Artist) features a recurring melody representing the object of the artist's obsessive affection and depicting her presence in various real and imagined situations.

Though perhaps not corresponding to the strict definition of leitmotiv, several of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s operas feature similar thematic tunes, often introduced in the overtures or preludes, and recurring to mark the presence of a character or to invoke a particular sentiment. In [[La forza del destino]], the opening theme of the overture recurs whenever Leonora feels guilt or fear. In [[Il trovatore|Il Trovatore]], the theme of the first aria by Azucena is repeated whenever she invokes the horror of how her mother was burnt alive and the devastating revenge she attempted then. In [[Don Carlos|Don Carlo]], there are at least three leitmotivs that recur regularly across the five acts: the first is associated with the poverty and suffering from war, the second is associated with prayers around the tomb of Carlos V, and the third is introduced as a duet between Don Carlo and the Marquis of Posa, thereafter accentuating sentiments of sincere friendship and loyalty.

===Wagner===
[[File:Siegfried's Horn Call E flat version 02.png|thumb|350px|The ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'''s Horn Call leitmotif from the prologue to Act I of Wagner's opera ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'', the fourth of his ''Ring'' cycle. The theme is broader and more richly orchestrated than its earlier appearances, suggesting the emergence of Siegfried's heroic character.[[File:Siegfried's Horn Call E flat version 01.wav|thumb|]]]]

[[Richard Wagner]] is the earliest composer most specifically associated with the concept of leitmotif. His cycle of four operas, ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' (the music for which was written between 1853 and 1869), uses hundreds of leitmotifs, often related to specific characters, things, or situations. While some of these leitmotifs occur in only one of the operas, many recur throughout the entire cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (1992), 234–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grout (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=l_b2vIXHsUkC&amp;pg=PA456 Chapter 22]&lt;/ref&gt;
Wagner had raised the issue of how music could best unite disparate elements of the plot of a music drama in his essay "[[Opera and Drama]]" (1851); the leitmotif technique corresponds to this ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Burbidge and Sutton, (1979), pp.&amp;nbsp;345–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Some controversy surrounded the use of the word in Wagner's own circle: Wagner never authorised the use of the word ''leitmotiv'', using words such as "Grundthema" (basic idea), or simply "Motiv".  His preferred name for the technique was ''Hauptmotiv'' (principal motif), which he first used in 1877;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; the only time he used the word ''Leitmotiv'', he referred to "so-called Leitmotivs".

The word gained currency with the overly literal interpretations of Wagner's music by [[Hans von Wolzogen]], who in 1876 published a ''Leitfaden'' (guide or manual) to the ''Ring''. In it he claimed to have isolated and named all of the recurring motifs in the cycle (the motif of "Servitude", the "Spear" or "Treaty" motif, etc.), often leading to absurdities or contradictions with Wagner's actual practice.&lt;ref&gt;See Thorau, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the motifs he identified began to appear in the published [[Sheet music|musical score]]s of the operas, arousing Wagner's annoyance; his wife [[Cosima Wagner]] quoted him as saying "People will think all this nonsense is done at my request!".&lt;ref&gt;Cosima Wagner,(1980), II, 697 (1 August 1881)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Wagner himself never publicly named any of his leitmotifs,  preferring to emphasise their flexibility of association, role in the musical form, and emotional effect. The practice of naming leitmotifs nevertheless continued, featuring in the work of prominent Wagnerian critics [[Ernest Newman]], [[Deryck Cooke]] and [[Robert Donington]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Donnington (1979), passim&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting lists of leitmotifs also attracted the ridicule of anti-Wagnerian critics and composers (such as [[Eduard Hanslick]], [[Claude Debussy]], and [[Igor Stravinsky]]). They identified the motif with Wagner's own approach to composing, mocking the impression of a musical "address book" or list of "cloakroom numbers" it created.&lt;ref&gt;Rehding (2007), 348&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Wagner===
[[Image:Salome leitmotif salome.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The leitmotif associated with Salome herself in Richard Strauss's opera ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]''.]]

Since Wagner, the use of leitmotifs has been taken up by many other composers. [[Richard Strauss]] used the device in many of his operas and several of his [[symphonic poem]]s. Despite his sometimes acerbic comments on Wagner, [[Claude Debussy]] utilised leitmotifs in his opera ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' (1902). [[Arnold Schoenberg]] used a complex set of leitmotifs in his choral work ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'' (completed 1911). [[Alban Berg]]'s opera ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1914–1922) also utilises leitmotifs.&lt;ref&gt;New Grove Dictionary,'' Leitmotif''&lt;/ref&gt; The leitmotif was also a major feature of the opera ''[[The Immortal Hour]]'' by the English composer [[Rutland Boughton]]. His constantly recurrent, memorably tuneful leitmotifs contributed in no small way to the widespread popularity of the opera.

===Critique of the leitmotif concept===
The critic [[Theodor W. Adorno]], in his book ''In Search of Wagner'' (written in the 1930s), expresses the opinion that the entire concept of the leitmotif is flawed. The motif cannot be both the bearer of expression and a musical 'gesture', because that reduces emotional content to a mechanical process. He notes that 'even in Wagner's own day the public made a crude link between the leitmotivs and the persons they characterised' because people's innate mental processes did not necessarily correspond with Wagner's subtle intentions or optimistic expectations. He continues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The degeneration of the leitmotiv is implicit in this&amp;nbsp;... it leads directly to [[film music|cinema music]] where the sole function of the leitmotiv is to announce heroes or situations so as to allow the audience to orient itself more easily.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno (2005), pp.34–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main ideology behind Leitmotif is to create a sense of attachment to that particular sound that evokes audiences to feel particular emotions when that sound is repeated through the film. Leitmotifs in Adorno's "degenerated" sense frequently occur in [[film score]]s, and have since the early decades of sound film. One of the first people to implement Leitmotif in early sound films was [[Fritz Lang]] in his revolutionary hit ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]''. Lang set the benchmark for sound film through his use of leitmotif, creating a different type of atmosphere in his films.

*[[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]'s 1938 score for ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' can be heard to attach particular themes and harmonies to individual characters: Robin, Will, Much, and Gisbourne are all accompanied by distinctive musical material.
*The instantly recognizable [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] leitmotif originally created by [[Monty Norman]] and [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] and reused in almost every subsequent Bond film. 
*In the [[Jaws (franchise)|Jaws franchise]], the main "shark" theme, composed by [[John Williams]], is a suspenseful motif that is a simple alternating pattern of two [[Musical note|note]]s, [[E (musical note)|E]] and [[F (musical note)|F]]. It used in all three sequels, a continuity that Williams compares to "the great tradition" for repeating musical themes in Hollywood serials such as [[Roy Rogers]] and [[The Lone Ranger]].&lt;ref name="Film Score Friday"&gt;{{cite news|author=Matessino, Michael |publisher=filmscoremonthly.com |title=Letter in response to "A Study of Jaws' Incisive Overture To Close Off the Century" |url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/1999/24_Sep---Film_Score_Friday.asp |date=1999-09-24 |accessdate=2006-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017155301/http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/1999/24_Sep---Film_Score_Friday.asp |archivedate=2006-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series, composer [[John Williams]] used a large number of themes specifically associated with people and concepts (for example, [[The Imperial March|a particular motif]] attaches to the presence of Darth Vader and another to the idea of the Force).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.depauw.edu/aevans_web/HONR101-02/WebPages/Spring2006/Rooney%28Jessica%29/starwarsleitmotif.htm|title=Untitled Document|work=depauw.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Shrek film series]] has a recurring sentimental theme, composed by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell, that is usually associated with the love between the titular character and Fiona.
*In the [[Harry Potter film series]], ''Hedwig's Theme'', composed by John Williams, is the dominant leitmotif for the film franchise and it has been interpolated throughout the rest of the Harry Potter film scores, including in those by [[Patrick Doyle]], [[Nicholas Hooper]], and [[Alexandre Desplat]]. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (film)|The Sorcerer's Stone]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|The Chamber of Secrets]]'', Williams makes use of principal motifs associated with characters, ideas and locations, which are repeated in both films.
*Composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Klaus Badelt]], the [[Pirates of the Caribbean film series]] consists of a number of motifs and themes associated with the protagonists, villains and moods.

It repeated throughout the film series as Sparrow's leitmotif. The other motif is ''[[He's a Pirate]]'', which is associated with pirates in general and the heroic action sequences involving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=7890|title=Audio: On The Score With Hans Zimmer|first=Daniel|last=Schweiger|date=May 16, 2011|publisher=Film Music Magazine|accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lepki–Murkim languages''' are a pair of apparently related but otherwise isolated languages of New Guinea,&lt;ref name=Glottolog/&gt; [[Lepki language|Lepki]] and [[Murkim language|Murkim]].

In 2007, on a  Papuan language website, a Mark Donohue reported that,
:''Murkim [and] Lepki [and] Kembra are, along with a number of other languages, unclassified groups living between the main cordillera and Mt. 6234, in the north of Papua near the PNG border (where 'near' = up to about 6 days' walk). They don't appear to be related to each other, based on wordlists, and they don't appear to show external affiliations.''[http://mailman.anu.edu.au/pipermail/papuanlanguages/2007-May/000142.html]
Hammarström (2010) is of the opinion that the few lexical similarities with Murkim are likely to be loans, and that Lepki should probably be considered a language isolate; he did not have access to any [[Kembra language|Kembra]] data.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Hammarström, 2010, 'The status of the least documented language families in the world'. In ''Language Documentation &amp; Conservation'', v 4, p 183 [http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4478/hammarstrom.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Glottolog'' 2.4 (2015), edited by Hammarström, said,
:''Though not forthcoming from the lexicostatistical counts in Theresia Wambaliau 2004, looking the actual words in the two languages, there are too many similarities to be mere chance (contra Harald Hammarström 2010).''&lt;ref name=Glottolog/&gt;

[[File:Arabian jasmin, Tunisia 2010.jpg|thumb|''Jasminum sambac'', the national flower of [[Indonesia]]]]
'''Indonesian floral emblems''' are [[Flora of Indonesia|Indonesian endemic flora]] that gain the status as national animal symbol that represent [[Indonesia]] and describe Indonesian [[biodiversity]]. Next to national floral symbols, there are also more specific [[Provinces of Indonesia|provincial]] floral emblems that represent each respective [[provinces of Indonesia]].

In addition, Indonesia also recognised [[Teak]] as the national tree.

== Indonesian national floral emblems ==
There are three categories of [[floral emblem]] that symbolise Indonesia:
#'''National flower''' ({{lang-id|Puspa bangsa}}) of [[Indonesia]] is ''[[Jasminum sambac|Melati putih]]'' (''Jasminum sambac''){{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
#'''Flower of charm''' ({{lang-id|Puspa pesona}}) is ''Anggrek Bulan'' (Moon Orchid) (''[[Phalaenopsis amabilis]]''))&lt;ref name="ASEANnationalflowers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/18204.htm|title=ASEAN National Flowers|publisher=ASEAN|accessdate=8 June 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120052549/http://www.asean.org/18204.htm|archivedate=20 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Rare flower''' ({{lang-id|Puspa langka}}) is ''Padma Raksasa Rafflesia'' (''[[Rafflesia arnoldii]]''). All three were chosen on World Environment Day in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asean.org/18203.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031050100/http://www.asean.org/18203.htm |archivedate=31 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other occasion ''Bunga Bangkai'' (''[[Titan arum]]'') was also added as ''puspa langka'' together with Rafflesia.

''Melati putih'' (''jasminum sambac''), a small white flower with sweet fragrance, has long been considered as a sacred flower in [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian tradition]], as it symbolises purity, sacredness, graceful simplicity and sincerity. Although the official adoption were announced only as early as 1990 during World Environment Day and enforced by law through Presidential Decree (''Keputusan Presiden'') No. 4 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proxsis.com/perundangan/LH/doc/uu/F00-1993-00004.pdf Keputusan Presiden No. 4 Tahun 1993] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402234237/http://www.proxsis.com/perundangan/LH/doc/uu/F00-1993-00004.pdf |date= 2 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the importance of ''Jasminum sambac'' in Indonesian culture predates its official adoption. Since the formation of Indonesian republic during the reign of Sukarno, ''melati putih'' is always unofficially recognised as the national flower of Indonesia. The reverence and the elevated status of this flower mostly due to the importance of ''jasminum sambac'' in Indonesian tradition since ancient times.

''Melati putih'' is also the most important flower in wedding ceremonies for ethnic Indonesians, especially in the island of [[Java]].&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac452e/ac452e05.htm|title=Cut Flower Production in Indonesia|author=Toto Sutater &amp; Kusumah Effendie|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmine flower buds that haven't fully opened are usually picked to create strings of jasmine garlands called ''roncen melati''. On wedding days, a traditional [[Javanese people|Javanese]] or [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] bride's hair is adorned with strings of jasmine garlands arranged as a hairnet to cover the ''konde'' ([[Bun (hairstyle)|hair bun]]). The intricately intertwined strings of jasmine garlands are left to hang loose from the bride's head. The groom's [[kris]] is also adorned with five jasmine garlands called ''roncen usus-usus'' (intestine garlands) to refer its intestine-like form and also linked to the legend of [[Kris#Keris Setan Kober|Arya Penangsang]]. In Makassar and [[Bugis]] brides, the hair is also adorned with buds of jasmine that resemble pearls. Jasmine is also used as floral offerings for spirits and deities especially among [[Balinese people|Balinese]] [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu]], and also often present during funerals.

The jasmine has wide spectrums in Indonesian traditions; it is the flower of life, beauty and festive wedding, yet it is also often associated with spirit and death. In Indonesian patriotic songs and poems, the fallen ''melati'' often hailed as the representation of fallen heroes that sacrificed their life for the country. The [[Ismail Marzuki]]'s  patriotic song ''"Melati di Tapal Batas"'' (jasmine on the border) (1947) and [[Guruh Sukarnoputra]]'s ''"Melati Suci"'' (sacred jasmine) (1974) clearly refer jasmine as the representation of fallen heroes, the eternally fragrance flower that adorned [[Ibu Pertiwi]] (Indonesian [[national personification]]). 
 
The other two national flowers were chosen for different reasons. Moon Orchid was chosen for its beauty, while the other two rare flowers, ''Rafflesia arnoldii'' and ''Titan arum'' were chosen to demonstrate uniqueness and [[Flora of Indonesia|Indonesian floral biodiversity]].

== Indonesian provinces floral emblems ==
Each of 33 Provinces of Indonesia also have native plants used as floral emblems. This is a list of Indonesian [[floral emblem]]s, which represent the [[provinces of Indonesia]].

{{italic title}}
'''''Motsoalle''''' is the term for socially acceptable, long-term relationships between [[Sotho people|Basotho]] women in [[Lesotho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2058560241.html|title=Never on Sunday With Grappa|last=Brown|first=Michelle E.|date=27 May 2010|work=Between the Lines|subscription=yes|access-date=19 June 2016|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Motsoalle'' can be translated from [[Sotho language|Sesotho]] loosely as "a very special friend."{{Sfn|Zabus|2013|p=43}} The word, ''motsoalle,'' is used to describe the other woman, as in "she is my ''motsoalle'';" and a ''motsoalle'' relationship describes the bond between the two women. ''Motsoalle'' relationships are socially sanctioned, and have often been celebrated by the people of Lesotho. These women's relationships usually occur alongside otherwise conventional [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] marriages and may involve various levels of physical intimacy between the female partners. ''Motsoalle'' relationships have, over time, begun to disappear in Lesotho.

== About ==
''Motsoalle'' relationships can first be formed between women during [[adolescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HK6sAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT324&amp;dq=motsoalle&amp;pg=PT324|title=A Companion to Translation Studies|last=Spurlin|first=William J.|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=9781118616154|editor-last=Bermann|editor-first=Sandra|location=|pages=|chapter=Queering Translation|editor-last2=Porter|editor-first2=Catherine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, a ''motsoalle'' relationship was acknowledged publicly with a ritual feast and with the community fully aware of the women's commitment to one another.{{Sfn|Peplau|2001|p=7}} One anecdote about a  ''motsoalle'' relationship describes how one woman, [[Mpho 'M'atsepho Nthunya]], and her husband threw a party in the 1950s to celebrate her ''motsoalle''.{{Sfn|Munro|2012|p=150}} Nthunya's account of her relationship with her partner, Malineo, was described to [[anthropologist]] K. Limakatso Kendall in a book, ''[[Singing Away the Hunger: The Autobiography of an African Woman]]'' (1997).{{Sfn|Kendall|1998b|p=220}} Judith Gay is another anthropologist to document these relationships, and she discovered they were once very common.{{Sfn|Kendall|1998b|p=220}} Jason Sullivan describes a form of ''motsoalle'' relationships among school girls where it functioned like a type of "[[puppy love]]" or mentorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Jason|date=17 June 2016|title=Eras in Education "Mummy-Baby" Relationships in 1950s Lesotho: Learning About Loving|url=https://www.voicemagazine.org/articles/articledisplay.php?ART=6951|journal=The Voice Magazine|volume=24|doi=|pmid=|access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other anthropologists who have described ''motsoalle'' relationships include [[Stephen O. Murray|Stephen Murray]] and [[Will Roscoe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferreira|first=Alberto José Viralhadas|date=July 2012|title='The Fate of Flesh': Post-Humanist Views of the Body and Gende|url=https://www.inter-disciplinary.net/critical-issues/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ferreiravispaper.pdf|journal=Inter-Disciplinary.net|doi=|pmid=|access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Motsoalle'' relationships differ from a [[Western world|western]] perspective of [[queer]] or [[lesbian]] relationships. Women in ''motsoalle'' relationships "marry men and conform, or appear to conform, to gender expectations."{{Sfn|Kendall|1998|p=239}} Women in these relationships do not have a different [[Identity (social science)|social identity]] even though they are in a committed relationship with another woman.{{Sfn|Peplau|2001|p=12}} Women in ''motsoalle'' relationships also differ from western ideas of heterosexual female friends.{{Sfn|Munro|2012|p=150}} Researcher, William J. Spurlin, stresses that "it is important not to simply translate into [[English language|English]] 'M'atsepo Nthunya's use of the Sesotho word ''motsoalle'' [...] as ''lesbian''."{{Sfn|Spurlin|2006|p=62}} Nevertheless, Spurlin does state that "it might be possible to place ''motsoalle'' relationships on the lesbian continuum to discuss, debate, and imagine them theoretically as possible sites of lesbian existence, given the close emotional and intimate bonds between the women, but with the stipulation that the relationships not be reduced to western understandings of 'lesbian.'"{{Sfn|Spurlin|2006|pp=71–72}}

Part of the difference between a ''motsoalle'' relationship and a lesbian one is due to the Sesotho notion of sex.{{Sfn|Munro|2012|p=150}} Many of the [[Sotho people|Basotho]] people of older generations in Lesotho did not consider an act a [[Human sexual activity|sex act]] if one partner was not male.{{Sfn|Munro|2012|p=151}} Therefore, anything women did together was not considered sex, even if it involved erotic components. Because of the social situation in rural Lesotho and the lack of a concept of lesbianism, ''motsoalle'' relationships were once widespread, but not seen as an "alternative to heterosexual marriage."{{Sfn|Kendall|199b|p=221}} Nthunya described it like this: "When a woman loves another woman, you see, she can love her with a whole heart."{{Sfn|Nthunya|1997|p=69}}

As Lesotho became more [[Modernization theory|modernized]], those communities exposed to western culture were also more likely to become exposed to [[homophobia]].{{Sfn|Kendall|1998b|p=222}} Kendall hypothesizes that as Western ideas spread, the idea that women could be sexual with one another, coupled with homophobia, began to erase the ''motsoalle'' relationships.{{Sfn|Kendall|1998b|p=222}} By the 1980s, the ritual feasts that were once celebrated by the community for ''motsoalles'' had vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickemann|first=Jeffrey M.|date=2001|title=Female Desires: Same-Sex Relations and Transgender Practices Across Cultures (Review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/31175|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=10|issue=1|pages=122–126|doi=|pmid=|access-date=22 June 2016|subscription=yes|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ''motsoalle'' relationships have largely disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGvp0LnYN7cC&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;ots=EPUawJ8fug&amp;dq=motsoalle|title=Tommy Boys, Lesbian Men and Ancestral Wives: Female Same-Sex practices in Africa|last=Wieringa|first=Saskia|publisher=Jacana Media|year=2005|isbn=9781770090934|editor-last=Morgan|editor-first=Ruth|location=|pages=295–296|chapter=Women Marriages and Other Same-Sex Practices: Historical Reflections on African Women's Same-Sex Relations|editor-last2=Wieringa|editor-first2=Saskia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4704">The '''Neogrammarians''' (German: ''Junggrammatiker'', 'young grammarians') were a [[Germany|German]] school of [[linguistics|linguists]], originally at the [[University of Leipzig]], in the late 19th century who proposed the '''Neogrammarian hypothesis''' of the regularity of [[sound change]].

==Overview==
According to the Neogrammarian hypothesis, a [[historical linguistics#Diachronic and synchronic analysis|diachronic]] sound change affects simultaneously all words in which its environment is met, without exception. [[Verner's law]] is a famous example of the Neogrammarian hypothesis, as it resolved an apparent exception to [[Grimm's law]]. The Neogrammarian hypothesis was the first hypothesis of sound change to attempt to follow the principle of [[falsifiability]] according to [[scientific method]].

Subsequent researchers have questioned this hypothesis from two perspectives. First, adherents of [[lexical diffusion]] (where a sound change affects only a few words at first and then gradually spreads to other words) believe that some words undergo changes before others. Second, some believe that it is possible for sound changes to observe grammatical conditioning. Nonetheless, both of these challenges to exceptionlessness remain controversial, and many investigators continue to adhere to the Neogrammarian doctrine.{{efn|For a discussion and rejection of grammatical conditioning see {{cite journal |surname=Hill |given=Nathan W. |year=2014 |url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staff46254.php |title=Grammatically conditioned sound change |journal=Language and Linguistics Compass |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=211–229 |doi=10.1111/lnc3.12073}}}}

Other contributions of the Neogrammarians to general linguistics were:

* The object of linguistic investigation is not the language system, but rather the [[idiolect]], that is, language as it is localized in the individual, and therefore is directly observable.
* Autonomy of the sound level: being the most observable aspect of language, the sound level is seen as the most important level of description, and absolute autonomy of the sound level from syntax and semantics is assumed.
* Historicism: the chief goal of linguistic investigation is the description of the [[language change|historical change]] of a language. 
* Analogy: if the premise of the inviolability of sound laws fails, [[analogy]] can be applied as an explanation if plausible. Thus, exceptions are understood to be a (regular) adaptation to a related form.

Leading Neogrammarian linguists included:

*[[Otto Behaghel]]  (1854–1936)
*[[Wilhelm Braune]] (1850–1926)
*[[Karl Brugmann]] (1849–1919)
*[[Berthold Delbrück]] (1842–1922)
*[[August Leskien]] (1840–1916)
*[[Adolf Noreen]] (1854–1925)
*[[Hermann Osthoff]] (1847–1909)
*[[Hermann Paul]] (1846–1921)
*[[Eduard Sievers]] (1850–1932)

Despite their strong influence in their time, the methods and goals of the Neogrammarians have been criticized for reducing the object of investigation to the idiolect; restricting themselves to the description of surface phenomena (sound level); overvaluation of historical languages and neglect of contemporary ones.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''''dii''''' (also '''''di''''') '''''Novensiles''''' or '''''Novensides''''' are collective deities of obscure significance found in [[epigraphy|inscriptions]], prayer formulary, and both ancient and [[Early Christian|early-Christian]] literary texts.

In antiquity, the initial element of the word ''novensiles'' was thought to [[etymology|derive]] from either "new" (''novus'') or "nine" (''novem'').&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "The Roman Religion," in ''Historia Religionum: Religions of the Past'' (Brill, 1969), vol. 1, p. 450; and "Roman Gods" in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1981, 1992), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The form ''novensides'' has been explained as "new settlers," from ''novus'' and ''insidere'', "to settle".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Dillon and Lynda Garland, ''Ancient Rome: From the Early Republic to the Assassination of Julius Caesar'' (Routledge, 2005), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The enduringly influential 19th-century scholar [[Georg Wissowa]] thought that the ''novensiles'' or ''novensides'' were deities the Romans regarded as imported, that is, not indigenous like the ''[[Di indigetes|di Indigetes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''De dis Romanorum indigetibus et novensidibus disputatio'' (1892), full text (in Latin) [https://books.google.com/books?id=FYlbAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22De+dis+Romanorum+indigetibus+et+novensidibus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Wissowa treated the categories of ''indigetes'' and ''novensiles'' as a fundamental way to classify Roman gods, the distinction is hard to maintain; many scholars reject it.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Altheim, ''A History of Roman Religion'', as translated by Harold Mattingly (London, 1938), pp. 110–112: "I pass deliberately over several other objections that may be raised against Wissowa's interpretation, because they would demand a long excursus"; [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North and S.R.F. Price. ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 158, note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnaldo Momigliano]] pointed out that no ancient text poses ''novensiles'' and ''indigetes'' as a dichotomy, and that the etymology of ''novensides'' is far from settled.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaldo Momigliano, "From Bachofen to Cumont," in ''A.D. Momigliano: Studies on Modern Scholarship''  (University of California Press, 1994), p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; In his treatise on [[orthography]], the 4th-century philosopher [[Marius Victorinus]] regarded the spellings ''novensiles'' and ''novensides'' as a simple [[phonetic]] alteration of ''l'' and ''d'', characteristic of the [[Osco-Umbrian languages|Sabine language]].&lt;ref&gt;Marius Victorinus, the section ''De orthographia'' from ''Ars grammatica liber primus de orthographia et de metrica ratione'', in the Teubner edition of Heinrich Keil, (Leipzig, 1874), p. 26 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BsQPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=%22sive+per+d+scribendum%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sive%20per%20d%20scribendum%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient sources say the ''novensiles'' are nine in number, leading to both ancient and modern identifications with other divine collectives numbering nine, such as the nine Etruscan deities empowered to wield thunder&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], as noted by [[Arnobius]], ''Adversus gentes'' 38–39; mentioned also, though not labeled as ''novensiles'', by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D53 2.52.]&lt;/ref&gt; or with the [[Muses]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Granius Flaccus]] and [[Lucius Aelius Stilo Praeconinus|Aelius Stilo]], as cited by Arnobius, ''Adversus gentes'' 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is thus sometimes spelled '''''Novemsiles''''' or '''''Novemsides'''''.

It may be that only the cults of deities considered indigenous were first established within the sacred boundary of Rome (''[[pomerium]]''), with "new" gods on the [[Aventine Hill]] or in the [[Campus Martius]], but it is uncertain whether the terms ''indigetes'' and ''novensiles'' correspond to this topography.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, ''Historia Religionum'', p. 450, and "Roman Gods," p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Warde Fowler]] observed&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Religious Experience'', pp. 157 and 319.&lt;/ref&gt; that at any rate a distinction between "indigenous" and "imported" begins to vanish during the [[Hannibalic War]], when immigrant&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Wacher, ''The Roman World'' (Routledge, 1987, 2002), p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt; deities are regularly invoked for the protection of the [[Roman State|state]].

==The invocation of Decius Mus==
{{Further|Devotio}}
The ''novensiles'' are invoked in a list of deities in a prayer formula preserved by the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] historian [[Livy]]. The prayer is uttered by [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 340 BC)|Decius Mus (consul 340 BC)]] during the [[Samnite Wars]] as part of his vow (''[[devotio]]'') to offer himself as a sacrifice to the infernal gods when a battle between the Romans and the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] has become desperate. Although Livy was writing at a time when [[Augustus]] cloaked religious innovation under appeals to old-fashioned [[pietas|piety]] and [[mos maiorum|traditionalism]], archaic aspects of the prayer suggest that it represents a traditional formulary as might be preserved in the official pontifical books. The other deities invoked — among them the [[Capitoline Triad|Archaic Triad]] of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus, as well as the [[Lares]] and [[Manes]] — belong to the earliest religious traditions of Rome. Livy even explains that he will record the archaic ritual of ''devotio'' at length because "the memory of every human and religious custom has withered from a preference for everything novel and foreign."&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 8.11.1: ''omnis divini humanique moris memoria abolevit nova peregrinaque omnia praeferendo''; Andrew Feldherr, ''Spectacle and Society in Livy's History'', (University of California Press, 1998), p. 41, note 125.&lt;/ref&gt; That the ''novensiles'' would appear in such a list at all, and before the ''indigetes'', is surprising if they are "new."&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, "Roman Gods," p. 70–71; Beard, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'', p. 158; Roger D. Woodard, ''Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult'' (University of Illinois Press, 2006), pp. 7–8; William Francis Allen, "The Religion of the Ancient Romans," in ''Essays and Monographs'' (Boston, 1890), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Lares and the Manes are "native" gods often regarded in ancient sources as the deified dead. [[Servius]] says that the ''novensiles'' are "old gods" who earned [[numen|numinous]] status (''dignitatem numinis'') through their ''[[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]]'', their quality of character.&lt;ref&gt;Servius, note to ''Aeneid'' 8.187: ''sane quidam veteres deos novensiles dicunt, quibus merita virtutis dederint numinis dignitatem.''&lt;/ref&gt; The early [[Christian apologist]] [[Arnobius]] notes other authorities who also regarded them as mortals who became gods. In this light, the ''novensiles'', like the Lares and Manes, may be "concerned with the subterranean world where ancestors were sleeping."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome: Religion in Everyday Life from Archaic to Imperial Times'' (Routledge, 1998, 2001), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divine redundancy==
[[File:Aeneis 3 147.jpeg|thumb|According to some sources, [[Aeneas]] (shown here with the [[Penates]] in a 4th-century illustration) was one of the '''''novensiles''''']]
The proliferation of deities among the Romans was mocked by the [[Church Fathers]]:

{{cquote|The inability of Romans of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]] to explain just who were the ''di Indigetes'' and ''di Novensiles'' caused [[Christian apologist]]s no end of amusement, and the whole project of classifying gods was denounced by [[Tertullian]] in a question: 'Shall I run through them individually, as many as they are, and as great: the new, the old, the barbarian, the Greek, Roman, foreign, captive, adopted, private, public, male, female, rustic, urban, naval, and military?'&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]], ''The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire'' (University of California Press, 2008), p. 135, citing Tertullian, ''Apologeticus'' 10.5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tertullian took a [[euhemerism|euhemerizing]] approach in explaining why the gods of the Romans kept multiplying; they were all, he said, merely people (''homines'') with birthplaces (''civitatibus, in quibus nati sunt'') and tombs (''sepulti'').&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''Apologeticus'' 10.2–4. Oddly, given questions of Christian theology pertaining to the human and divine nature of [[Jesus]] (see discussion at [[Incarnation (Christianity)]], [[Hypostatic union]], [[Communicatio idiomatum]], [[Jesus in Christianity#Humanity|Jesus in Christianity: Humanity]], [[Christology#Person of Christ|Christology: Person of Christ]], and [[Seventh-day Adventist theology#The human nature of Jesus Christ|Seventh-day Adventist theology: The human nature of Jesus Christ]]), Tertullian also remarks that if Saturn, who as far as he can determine was the most ancient god, "were a man, he had undoubtedly a human origin; and having a human origin, he was not the offspring of heaven and earth" (''tamen, si homo Saturnus, utique ex homine, et quia ab homine, non utique de Caelo et Terra'', ''Apolog.'' 10.9). The language in the last phrase seems to echo the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] prayer formula "I am the child of Earth and starry Heaven" (Γῆς παῖς εἰμι καὶ Ούρανοῦ ἀστερόεντος), for which see [[Totenpass#Interpretation|Totenpass: Interpretation]].&lt;/ref&gt; Arnobius, similarly attempting to demonstrate the logical flaws in the Roman conception of [[divinity]], offers what is perhaps the most extended discussion of the ''novensiles'' in any extant source, and lists seven authorities whose explanations of their identity strike him as mutually exclusive. Several other sources, he notes, say that the ''novensiles'' are people (''homines'') who have become ''[[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Divus, deus and the numen|divus]]'', "divine" or "deified'; among these ''divi'' are [[Hercules]], [[Romulus]], [[Aesculapius]], [[Liber]], and Aeneas.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius, ''Adversus gentes'' 38–39, English translation [https://books.google.com/books?id=7TgMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA474&amp;dq=%22Piso+believes+that+the+Novensiles+are+nine+gods%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Piso%20believes%20that%20the%20Novensiles%20are%20nine%20gods%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sabine origin==
According to Arnobius, a Piso, most likely the [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (consul 133 BC)|Calpurnius Piso Frugi]] who was an [[annalist]] and [[Roman consul|consul]] in 133 BC,&lt;ref&gt;M. Burghard, ''Arnobius of Sicca: The Case Against the Pagans'' (Paulist Press, 1975), p. 368, note 224 (where he errs in giving the year of Piso's consulship as 233 rather than 133 BC); possible identifications discussed in ''Berichte über die Verhandlungen der königlich sächsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig'' (1848), vol. 1, pp. 429–430.&lt;/ref&gt; said that the ''novensiles'' were nine gods whose cult had been established in [[Sabina (region)|Sabine country]] at Trebia. The location has been identified variously as the river [[Trebbia]], [[Trevi nel Lazio]], or one of the places called Trebula in antiquity, two of which — [[Trebula Mutusca]] and [[Trebula Suffenas]] — are in Sabine territory.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, "The Tribal Membership of the Calpurnii Pisones," ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 83 (1990), p. 297; ''A Handbook of Rome and Its Environs'' (London, 1864, 7th ed.), p. 370 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGBrcKZ6-yQC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=sabine+trebia&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q=sabine%20trebia&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Forsythe has conjectured that Piso's family came from the middle [[Tiber]] valley, on the border of [[Etruria]] and Sabine country, and that he was drawing on personal knowledge. The father of this Piso is probably the L. Calpurnius who dedicated a shrine to [[Feronia (goddess)|Feronia]] at ''[[Lucus Feroniae]]'' near [[Capena]].&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, "The Tribal Membership of the Calpurnii Pisones," p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Varro]], who was himself Sabine, placed the ''Novensides'' in his much-noted catalogue of Sabine deities.&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De Lingua Latina'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=wHEGcPZZmHwC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Novensides&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=30#v=onepage&amp;q=Novensides&amp;f=false 5.74.]&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions in Sabine country mention the ''novensiles'' or ''novensides'', for instance, ''dieu. nove. sede'' at [[Pisaurum]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 1.178; for full inscription as transcribed in Engelbert Joseph Schneider, '' Dialecti latinae priscae et faliscae exempla selecta''  (Leipzig, 1886), p. 7 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WAErAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%22V.+Tituli+votivi+Pisaurenses%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22V.%20Tituli%20votivi%20Pisaurenses%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Marsi]]an inscription also names the ''novensiles'' without the ''indigetes''.&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' 12.375. ''Esos Novesede pesco pacre'': "to the Lords Novesede peace bringing sacrifice".&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century scholar [[Edward Greswell]] sought to connect the nine ''novensiles'' of the Sabines to the [[Nundinae|nundinal cycle]], the eight-day "week" of the [[Roman calendar]] that Roman [[Counting#Inclusive counting|inclusive counting]] reckoned as nine days.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Greswell, ''Origines Kalendariae Italicae, Nundinal Calendars of Ancient Italy, Nundinal Calendar of Romulus, Calendar of Numa Pompilius, Calendar of the Decemvirs, Irregular Roman Calendar, and Julian Correction. Tables of the Roman Calendar, from U.C. 4 of Varro B.C. 750 to U.C. 1108 A.D. 355'' (Oxford University Press, 1884), vol. 2, pp. 394–397.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nine deities==
A 4th- or 3rd-century BC inscription from [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]] reading ''neven deivo'' has been taken to refer to the Novensiles as nine deities.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.455; Vittore Pisani, (1943) p.253 as quoted by G. C. L. Bakkum ''The Latin Dialect of the Ager Faliscus'' Amsterdam 2009 p. 62 ; Emil Vetter, "Di Novensiles Di Indigetes" in ''Indogermanische Forschungen'' LXII (1956) p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Granius Flaccus]] and [[Lucius Aelius Stilo Praeconinus|Aelius Stilo]], Arnobius says, identify the ''Novensiles'' with the [[Muses]], implying that they are nine in number. In the Roman tradition, the Muses became [[interpretatio graeca|identified with]] the [[Camenae]], the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] goddesses of fresh-water sources and prophetic inspiration. The two best-known of the Camenae were [[Carmentis]] (or Carmenta), who had her own [[flamen]] and in whose honor the [[Carmentalia]] was held, and [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]], the divine consort of [[Numa Pompilius]], the second king of Rome considered the founder of [[Roman law]] and religion. Numa had established a bronze shrine at the fountain in their grove, the site of his divine union with Egeria.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. King, ''Desiring Rome: Male Subjectivity and Reading Ovid's Fast'' (The Ohio State University Press, 2006), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain of the Camenae was a source of water for the [[Vestals]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarolta A. Takács, ''Vestal Virgins, Sibyls, and Matrons: Women in Roman Religion'' (University of Texas Press, 2008), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5th-century scholar [[Martianus Capella]] placed the ''Dii Novensiles'' within his [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan]]-influenced celestial schema in his work ''On the Marriage of Mercury and Philology'',&lt;ref&gt;For a diagram combining the heavenly sphere of Martianus Capella and that of the [[Liver of Piacenza|Piacenza liver]], see Nancy Thomson De Grummond, ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 2006), p. 50 [https://books.google.com/books?id=TVAtdzbV-yIC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=NOvensiles&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=237#v=onepage&amp;q=NOvensiles&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and took their name as meaning "nine." He locates the ''Novensiles'' in the second region of the heavens, with [[Jove]], [[Mars (mythology)#Mars Quirinus|Mars Quirinus]], the "Military [[Lares|Lar]]," [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Fontus|Fons]] ("Fountain" or "Source"), and the [[Lympha]]e (fresh-water goddesses).&lt;ref&gt;''In secunda itidem mansitabant praeter domum Iovis, quae ibi quoque sublimis est, ut est in omnibus praediatus, Quirinus Mars, Lars Militaris; Juno etiam ibi domicilium possidebat, Fons etiam, Lymphae diique Novensiles'': De Grummond, ''Etruscan Myth'', pp. 45 and 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Council on lightning==
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' 2.52.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions nine gods of the Etruscans who had the power of wielding thunderbolts, pointing toward Martianus's Novensiles as gods pertaining to the use of thunder and lightning ''(fulgura)'' as signs. Books on how to read lightning were one of the three main branches of the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#disciplina Etrusca|disciplina Etrusca]]'', the body of Etruscan religious and divinatory teachings. Within the Etruscan discipline, Jupiter has the power to wield three types of admonitory lightning ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#manubia|manubiae]])'' sent from three different celestial regions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pallottino]], "The Doctrine and Sacred Books of the ''Disciplina Etrusca''," ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), pp. 43–44; Stefan Weinstock, "Libri fulgurales," ''Papers of the British School at Rome'' 19 (1951), p. 125. The word may be either a [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinized]] word from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] or less likely a formation from ''manus'', "hand," and ''habere'', "to have, hold." It is not apparently related to the more common Latin word ''manubiae'' meaning "booty (taken by a general in war)."&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these, mild or "perforating"&lt;ref&gt;The description of the three types of lightning as "perforating," "crushing," and "burning" is Weinstock's, ''Libri fulgurales'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; lightning, is a beneficial form meant to persuade or dissuade.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Dumézil]], ''La religion romaine archaïque'' (Paris 1974), pp. 630 and 633 (note 3), drawing on [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Naturales Questiones'' 2.41.1–2 and 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The other two types are harmful or "crushing" lightning, for which Jupiter requires the approval of the [[Di Consentes]], and completely destructive or "burning" lighting, which requires the approval of the ''di superiores et involuti'' (hidden gods of the "higher" sphere).&lt;ref&gt;Weinstock, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scholars&lt;ref&gt;C.O. Thulin, "Die Goetter des Martianus Capella und der Bronzenleber von Piacenza," in ''Religiongeschichtliche Versuche und Vorarbeiten'' (1906) pp. 34-40; A. Grenier, "Indigetes et Novensiles," in ''Boletim de Philologia'' supplem. 1951, pp. 203-4; Gérard Capdeville, "Les dieux de Martianus Capella," ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' 213 (1996), pp. 269-274.&lt;/ref&gt; have identified the Novensiles with the council of gods who decide on the use of the third, most destructive type of lightning. Carl Thulin proposed that two [[wikt:theonym|theonyms]]  from the [[Piacenza Liver]] — a bronze model of a sheep's liver covered with Etruscan inscriptions pertaining to [[haruspicy]] — ought to be identified with the two councils, ''Cilens(l)'' with the Novensiles and ''Thufltha(s)'' with the ''Consentes [[Penates]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thulin, "Die Goetter des Martianus Capella," pp. 34–40 ''et passim'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=AhsAAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Favores+Opertanei%22&amp;q=%22Favores+Opertanei%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Favores%20Opertanei%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Novensiles would thus correspond to the ''di superiores et involuti''&lt;ref&gt;Named as such by Seneca, ''Naturales Questiones'' 2.41.1–2; [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] p. 219M = 114 edition of Lindsay; entry on ''peremptalia fulgura'', p. 236 in the 1997 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Ugb6woUJLoC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=manubia+OR+manubiae&amp;lr=&amp;cd=21#v=onepage&amp;q=manubia%20OR%20manubiae&amp;f=false Teubner edition]; and Martianus Capella; see also [[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Nationes'' 3.38.&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the ''Favores Opertanei''  ("Secret Gods of Favor") referred to by Martianus Capella. Martianus, however, locates the ''Favores''&lt;ref&gt;Martanus Capella, 1.45. For the passage in translation, see de Grummond, ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend'', pp. 45–46. The name ''Favores'', "favoring" gods, is a euphemism (compare [[Erinyes|Eumenides]]) in contrast to their destructive power; Iiro Kajanto, "Fortuna," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II. 17.1 (1981), p. 507, note 18.&lt;/ref&gt; in the first region of the sky, with the ''Di Consentes'' and Penates, and the Novensiles in the second; the ''Favores'' are perhaps the ''Fata'', "Fates".&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Capdeville, "Les dieux de Martianus Capella," ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' 213 (1996), pp. 260–262 and 273–274; see also Nancy Thomson de Grummond, ''The Religion of the Etruscans'' (University of Texas Press, 2006), pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pesme bratstva, detinjstva &amp; potomstva: Antologija ex YU rok poezije 1967 - 2007''''' (trans. ''Songs of Brotherhood, Childhood &amp; Offspring: Anthology of [[SFRY|Ex YU]] [[Rock music|Rock]] Poetry 1967 - 2007'') is a book by [[Serbia]]n author, journalist and music critic [[Petar Janjatović]]. Published in 2008, the book is the second, expanded edition of Janjatović's 1993 book '''''Pesme bratstva &amp; detinjstva: Antologija rok poezije SFR Jugoslavije 1967 - 1991''''' (''Songs of Brotherhood &amp; Childhood: Anthology of Rock Poetry in SFR Yugoslavia 1967 - 1991''). The book features lyrics by acts from the [[Popular music in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslav rock scene]] and the scenes of the successor states.

==Background==
In the original (1993) introduction, entitled "Od Osmeha do plavog neba" ("From Smile to Blue Sky", referencing [[Grupa 220]]'s song "Osmeh" and [[Obojeni Program]]'s track "Nebo, nebo plavo je"), Janjatović states his intention of presenting a selection of [[poetry|poetic]] lyrics written by Yugoslav rock musicians.&lt;ref name="janjatović5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Janjatović|first=Petar|title= Pesme bratstva, detinjstva &amp; potomstva: Antologija ex YU rok poezije 1967 - 2007|year=2008|publisher=Vega media|location=Belgrade|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the author, the appearance of poetic lyrics in Yugoslav rock occurred right away with the release of the first full-length Yugoslav rock album — Grupa 220's ''Naši dani'' (''Our Days'') — despite the fact that during the 1960s and early 1970s the poets among Yugoslav rock lyricists were still few and far between.&lt;ref name="janjatović5"/&gt; In Janjatović's opinion, it wasn't until [[Punk rock in Yugoslavia|punk rock]] and [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|new wave]] took root in the country that Yugoslav acts made artistic rock lyrics imperative.&lt;ref name="janjatović5"/&gt;

Additionally, Janjatović stated:
{{cquote|''I wrote the above on 21 March 1991, sitting on a faraway [[Thailand|Thai]] island, as an introduction to the anthology. During the 1990/1991 winter, I enjoyed listening to old as well as new Yugoslav rock'n'roll albums, and I gradually made a selection of what I considered to be the most valuable lyrics of that musical genre. I then submitted the manuscript to the publisher and went on a holiday. When I returned, everything changed. [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia began breaking apart]] and who could care about something as demode as its rock anthology. And then, during the winter of 1992/1993, I returned to these poems, realizing that now the book has a completely different meaning, close to the one of [[Yugonostalgia]]. And that after all that happened, a large number of these songs can be read in a new, moving way. And that this is a poetic history of the rock'n'roll scene that ceased to exist in June 1991.&lt;ref name="janjatović5-6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Janjatović|first=Petar|title= Pesme bratstva, detinjstva &amp; potomstva: Antologija ex YU rok poezije 1967 - 2007|year=2008|publisher=Vega media|location=Belgrade|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 2008 addendum to the original introduction, Janjatović wrote:

{{cquote|''So, here is the second, expanded edition. After all these years, everything is different, but the scene managed to survive. As did some of us. Most of the lyrics written after 1991 are filled with bitterness and wisdom. The time was such that it couldn't have been any different.&lt;ref name="janjatović6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Janjatović|first=Petar|title= Pesme bratstva, detinjstva &amp; potomstva: Antologija ex YU rok poezije 1967 - 2007|year=2008|publisher=Vega media|location=Belgrade|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Notable absences===
In a 2012 interview, Janjatović was asked why there are no [[Đorđe Balašević]] lyrics in the book. Janjatović answered:

{{cquote|''Initially, I planned to include a large number of Balašević's lyrics in the book, especially the political ones he wrote during the 1990s. When we saw how many of poems there are, a serious question of copyright arose. So it would be better if Balašević himself made a book with a choice from his lyrics.&lt;ref name="balkanrock"&gt;[http://balkanrock.com/petar-janjatovic-fizicka-izdanja-gube-trku-s-internetom/ "Petar Janjatović: Fizička izdanja gube trku s internetom", balkanrock.com]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* When it comes to royalties, Dzoni Stulic's permission for publishing 26 of his songs in the book was not asked for due to an unfortunate oversight.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43699">A '''platform cooperative''', or '''platform co-op''', is a cooperatively owned, democratically governed business that establishes a [[computing platform]], and uses a website, mobile app or a protocol to facilitate the sale of goods and services. Platform cooperatives are an alternative to [[venture capital]] funded platforms insofar as they are owned and governed by those who depend on them most—workers, users, and other relevant stakeholders. Proponents of platform cooperativism claim that, by ensuring the financial and social value of a platform circulate among these participants, platform cooperatives will bring about a more equitable and fair digitally mediated economy in contrast with the extractive models of corporate intermediaries. Platform cooperatives differ from traditional cooperatives not only due to their use of digital technologies, but also by their contribution to the commons for the purpose of fostering an equitable social and economic landscape.

Platform cooperativism draws upon other attempts at digital disintermediation, including the peer-to-peer production movement, led by [[Michel Bauwens]], [[Vasilis Kostakis]] and the P2P Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://p2pfoundation.net/ |website=P2P Foundation |access-date=10 December 2016 | title= P2P Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; which advocates for "new kinds of democratic and economic participation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/portfolio/our-story |title=Our Story |website=P2P Foundation |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that rest "upon the free participation of equal partners, engaged in the production of common resources," as well as the radically distributed, non-market mechanisms of networked peer-production promoted by Yochai Benkler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@trebors/platform-cooperativism-vs-the-sharing-economy-2ea737f1b5ad#.575nndfdq |title=Platform Cooperativism vs. the Sharing Economy |last=Scholz |first=Trebor |date=5 December 2014 |website=Medium |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marjorie Kelly's book ''Owning Our Future'' contributed the distinction between democratic and extractive ownership design to this discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Owning Our Future|last=Kelly|first=Marjorie|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers|year=2012|isbn=1605093106|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==

While there is no commonly accepted typology of platform cooperatives, researchers often ontologize platform cooperatives by industry. Some potential categories include: transportation, on-demand labor, journalism, music, creative projects, timebank, film, home health care, photography, data cooperatives, marketplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Jw8asCmKKrlujp |title=The Prospects of Platform Cooperativism |last=Scholz |first=Trebor |date=4 December 2016 |website=Slideshare |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other typologies differentiate platform cooperatives by their governance or ownership structures.

==Examples==
Many platform co-operatives use business models similar to better-known apps or web services, but with a cooperative structure. For example, there are numerous driver-owned taxi apps that allow customers to submit trip requests and notify the nearest driver, similar to Uber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2016/08/10/profile-of-peoples-ride-a-c.html|title=Profile of People's Ride: a co-operative, driver-owned alternative to Uber|date=10 August 2016|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/denver-taxi-drivers-are-turning-ubers-disruption-on-its-head/|title=Denver Taxi Drivers Are Turning Uber's Disruption on Its Head|publisher=The Nation|accessdate=25 November 2016|first=Nathan|last=Schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet of Ownership website includes a directory of the platform co-op "ecosystem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internetofownership.net/directory|title=The Internet of Ownership: Directory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fairbnb''' is an online marketplace and hospitality service for people to lease or rent short-term lodging. Foremost, it is also a community of activists, coders, researchers and designers working to create the platform to enable hosts and guests to connect for travel and cultural exchange, while minimizing the cost to communities. It is an alternative to commercial platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fairbnb.coop|title=A smart and fair solution for community powered tourism|website=fairbnb.coop|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fairmondo''' is an online marketplace for ethical goods and services, that originated from Germany and has expanded to the UK. Joining as a stakeholder is open for all and the minimum share is limited to an affordable amount, with stakeholders exercising a democratic control through one-member-one-vote principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fairmondo.de/global |title=Welcome to Fairmondo |website=Fairmondo |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a cooperative alternative to Amazon and Ebay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scholz |first=Trebor |date=2016 |title=Platform Cooperativism: Challenging the Sharing Economy |url=http://www.rosalux-nyc.org/wp-content/files_mf/scholz_platformcoop_5.9.2016.pdf |location=New York |publisher=Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Loconomics''' is a worker-owned, US-based, online and mobile marketplace that allows customers to find freelance labor to small, everyday tasks, such as babysitting or pet care.

==Platform co-operativism==

Platform Cooperativism is an intellectual framework and movement which advocates for the global development of platform cooperatives. Its advocates object to the techno-solutionist claim that technology is, by default, the answer to all social problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicseminar.org/2015/04/think-outside-the-boss/ |title=Think Outside the Boss: Cooperative Alternatives to the Sharing Economy |last=Scholz |first=Trebor |date=5 April 2015 |website=Public Seminar |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://internetofownership.net/2016/09/07/an-internet-of-ownership/ |title=An Internet of ownership: democratic design for the online economy |last=Schneider |first=Nathan |date=7 December 2016 |website=The Internet of Ownership |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Dwyer |first1=Rachel |editor-last1=Scholz |editor-first1=Trebor |editor-last2=Schneider |editor-first2=Nathan |date=2016 |title=Ours To Hack and Own: The Rise of Platform Cooperativism, a New Vision for the Future of Work and a Fairer Internet |location=New York |publisher=OR Books |page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, proponents of the movement claim that ethical commitments such as the building of the [[global commons]], support of inventive unions, and promotion of ecological and social sustainability as well as [[social justice]], are necessary to shape an equitable and fair [[social economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://platformcoop.newschool.edu/index.php/about/mission/ |title=Mission |website=Platform Cooperativism Consortium |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Platform cooperativism advocates for the coexistence of cooperatively owned business models and traditional, extractive models with the goal of a more diversified digital labor landscape respecting fair working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scholz |first=Trebor |date=2016 |title=Uberworked and Underpaid: How Workers Are Disrupting the Digital Economy |location=New York City |publisher=Polity |at=Part II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While platform cooperatives are structured as [[cooperatives]], granting democratic control to workers, customers, users, or other key stakeholders, companies and initiatives that support the ecosystem of the cooperative platform economy are considered a part of the platform cooperativism movement insofar as they attempt to encourage, develop, and sustain its development. It has also been argued that, as the spread of platform cooperativism "will require a different kind of ecosystem -- with appropriate forms of finance, law, policy, and culture -- to support the development of democratic online enterprises," any person or business associated with the development of this ecosystem can be considered a proponent of platform cooperativism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schneider |first1=Nathan |last2=Scholz |first2=Trebor |editor-last1=Scholz |editor-first1=Trebor |editor-last2=Schneider |editor-first2=Nathan |date=2016 |title=Ours To Hack and Own: The Rise of Platform Cooperativism, a New Vision for the Future of Work and a Fairer Internet |url=http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/ours-to-hack-and-to-own/ |location=New York |publisher=OR Books |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the term===

The term "platform cooperativism" was coined by New School professor Trebor Scholz in a 2014 article titled, "Platform Cooperativism vs. the Sharing Economy", in which he criticized popular sharing economy platforms and called for the creation of democratically controlled cooperative alternatives that "allow workers to exchange their labor without the manipulation of the middleman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@trebors/platform-cooperativism-vs-the-sharing-economy-2ea737f1b5ad#.575nndfdq |title=Platform Cooperativism vs. the Sharing Economy |last=Scholz |first=Trebor |date=5 December 2014 |website=Medium |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, journalist [[Nathan Schneider]] published an article, "Owning Is the New Sharing", which documented a variety of projects using cooperative models for digitally mediated commerce, as well as online, distributed funding-models which hoped to replace the venture-capital model predominant in the technology sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shareable.net/blog/owning-is-the-new-sharing |title=Owning is the New Sharing |last=Schneider |first=Nathan |date=21 December 2014 |website=Shareable |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Scholz and Schneider would later credit the work and provocations of other researchers and digital-labor advocates as their inspiration, including, among others, lawyer Janelle Orsi of the [[Sustainable Economies Law Center]], who had "called on technology companies in the sharing economy to share ownership and profits with their users," and Amazon Mechanical Turk organizer Kristy Milland who had proposed a worker-owned alternative to the platform at the "Digital Labor: Sweatshops, Picket Lines, Barricades" conference in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schneider |first=Nathan |editor-last1=Scholz |editor-first1=Trebor |editor-last2=Schneider |editor-first2=Nathan |date=2016 |title=Ours To Hack and Own: The Rise of Platform Cooperativism, a New Vision for the Future of Work and a Fairer Internet |location=New York |publisher=OR Books |chapter=The Meanings of Words}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://civichall.org/civicist/conversation-with-trebor-scholz-platform-coop/ |title=A Conversation with Trebor Scholz on the Rise of Platform Cooperativism |last=Sifry |first=Micah L. |date=25 October 2016 |website=Civic Hall |access-date=10 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several other precursors to platform cooperativism. In 2012, the Italian cooperative federation Legacoop promulgated a manifesto on the "[[Cooperative Commons]]," which called for bringing the lessons of the cooperative movement to control over online data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Legacoop|title=Digital Commons: Manifesto|url=http://www.cooperativecommons.coop/index.php/en/manifesto|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year [[Mayo Fuster Morell]] published an article named "horizons of digital commons" in which she pointed to the evolution of commons-based peer production merging with cooperatives and the social economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caritas.es/imagesrepository/CapitulosPublicaciones/4563/05%20-%20HORIZONTES%20DEL%20PROCOMUN%20DIGITAL.pdf|title=Horizontes del procomún digital|last=Fuster Morell|first=Mayo|date=September 2012|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article reflects on an event named Building Digital commons, which took place in October 2011. It was the goal of the event to further connect the cooperative tradition and collaborative production. Other previous similar terms on new forms of cooperativism such as "open cooperativism"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauwens, M., |first=Kostakis, V.|year=2014|title=From the communism of capital to capital for the commons: Towards an open co-operativism.|journal=[[TripleC]]|volume=12 |issue=1|pages=356|url=http://www.triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/561|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also studies of how the digital environment opens up new possibilities for the cooperative tradition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Peuter &amp; Dyer-Witheford|first=G.|year=2010|title=Commons and cooperatives.|url=|journal=Affinities: a journal of radical theory, culture, and action|volume=4 |issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are of relevance to the new term platform cooperativism.

In 2015, Scholz published a primer on platform cooperativism, "Platform Cooperativism: Challenging the Corporate Sharing Economy", which was published in five languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://platform.coop/private/the-platform-coop-primer |title=The Platform Cooperativism Primer |date= |website=platform.coop |access-date=10 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to internationalize the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://platformcoop.newschool.edu/index.php/contributors/ |title=Contributors |website=Platform Cooperativism Consortium |access-date=10 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he published ''Uberworked and Underpaid: How Workers Are Disrupting the Digital Economy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scholz |first=Trebor |date=2016 |title=Uberworked and Underpaid: How Workers Are Disrupting the Digital Economy |location=New York City |publisher=Polity}}&lt;/ref&gt; which further developed the concept. Together, Scholz and Schneider went on to convene an event on the subject, "Platform Cooperativism. The Internet. Ownership. Democracy", at The New School in November 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://platform.coop/2015 |title=Platform Cooperativism. The Internet. Ownership. Democracy |website=platform.coop |access-date=10 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and edit a book, ''Ours to Hack and to Own: The Rise of Platform Cooperativism, a New Vision for the Future of Work and a Fairer Internet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Scholz |editor-first1=Trebor |editor-last2=Schneider |editor-first2=Nathan |date=2016 |title=Ours To Hack and Own: The Rise of Platform Cooperativism, a New Vision for the Future of Work and a Fairer Internet |location=New York |publisher=OR Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roots in criticism of the sharing economy ===

The concept of platform cooperativism emerged from the discourse surrounding digital labor, popular in the late 2000s and early 2010s, which critiqued the use of digitally mediated labor markets to evade traditional labor protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civichall.org/civicist/conversation-with-trebor-scholz-platform-coop/|title=A Conversation with Trebor Scholz on the Rise of Platform Cooperativism|last=Sifry|first=Micah L.|date=25 October 2016|website=Civic Hall|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies of digital labor, using the theories of Italian Workerists, focused on the "free" or "immaterial" labor performed by users of Web 2.0 platforms (sometimes referred to as "playbor"), while later analyses served to critique the "crowd fleecing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uberworked and Underpaid: How Workers Are Disrupting the Digital Economy|last=Scholz|first=Trebor|date=2016|publisher=Polity|location=New York City|chapter=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Network Culture: Politics for the Information Age|last=Terranova|first=Tiziana|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2004|isbn=0-7453-1748-0|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of digital laborers by microtask labor-brokerages such as [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] and [[CrowdFlower|Crowdflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ours To Hack and Own: The Rise of Platform Cooperativism, a New Vision for the Future of Work and a Fairer Internet|last=Scholz|first=Trebor|date=2016|publisher=OR Books|location=New York|page=23|chapter=How Platform Cooperativism Can Unleash the network|editor-last2=Schneider|editor-first2=Nathan|editor-last1=Scholz|editor-first1=Trebor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the digital labor discourse shifted to the so-called "sharing economy", resulting in an increase in both academic and media attention to the practices and policies of online markets for labor, services, and goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@trebors/platform-cooperativism-vs-the-sharing-economy-2ea737f1b5ad#.575nndfdq|title=Platform Cooperativism vs. the Sharing Economy|last=Scholz|first=Trebor|date=5 December 2014|website=Medium|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers and labor advocates argued that platforms such as Uber and TaskRabbit were unfairly classifying full-time workers as independent contractors rather than employees, thus avoiding legally granted labor protections such as minimum-wage laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://static.opensocietyfoundations.org/misc/future-of-work/the-sharing-economy.pdf|title=Is sharing really caring?

Other research focused on the automated management of the digital workplace by algorithms, without worker recourse. For example, the wage-per-mile by drivers on the Uber platform is controlled moment-to-moment by a surge pricing algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SSRN-id2686227.pdf|title=Uber's Drivers: Information Asymmetries and Control in Dynamic Work|last2=Stark|first2=Luke|date=15 October 2015|publisher=Data &amp; Society|page=5|last1=Rosenblat|first1=Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tomslee.net/why-canada-should-de-activate-uber|title=Why Canada should de-activate Uber|last=Slee|first=Tom|date=26 November 2014|website=Tom Slee|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its drivers can lose their jobs if they fall behind any one of a number of metrics logged by the platform including ride-acceptance percentage (minimum 90%) and customer-rating (4.7 out of 5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tomslee.net/why-canada-should-de-activate-uber|title=Why Canada should de-activate Uber|last=Slee|first=Tom|date=26 November 2014|website=Tom Slee|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing economy workers who complained about this algorithmic management were often ignored, (e.g. a [[TaskRabbit]] discussion forum was shut down in response to worker unrest)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/07/10/taskrabbit-users-revolt-as-the-company-shuts-down-its-bidding-system/|title=TaskRabbit users revolt as the company shuts down its bidding system|last=Weber|first=Harrison|date=10 July 2014|website=Venture Beat|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes told that, insofar as the platform owners do not employ their contracted labor force, they were not actually being managed by the technology companies behind the platforms on which they worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/if-taskrabbit-is-the-future-of-employment-the-employed-1609221541|title=If TaskRabbit Is the Future of Employment, the Employed Are Fucked|last=Biddle|first=Sam|date=23 July 2014|website=Gawker|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/big-data/uber-drivers-under-algorithmic-management-study/d/d-id/1326465|title=Uber Drivers Under Algorithmic Management: Study|last=Claburn|first=Thomas|date=2 August 2016|website=Information Week|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as platform cooperatives offer worker-owners a more robust degree of control of the platforms they use, the model was seen as offering an ethical alternative to existing sharing economy platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.rosalux-nyc.org/wp-content/files_mf/scholz_platformcoop_5.9.2016.pdf|title=Platform Cooperativism: Challenging the Sharing Economy|last=Scholz|first=Trebor|date=2016|publisher=Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these early critiques of the sharing economy remain relevant, platform cooperatives tend to highlight their efforts to provide their worker-owners with a living wage or a fair share of revenues, benefits, control over the platform's design, and democratic influence over the management of the cooperative business.

==Public policy==

The platform cooperativism movement has seen a number of global policy proposals and successes.

=== Spain ===

==== Barcelona ====

Barcelona has a long tradition of connecting cooperativism and collaborative production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Fuster |first=Mayo |date=2012 |title=Horizontes de procomún digital |location=Barcelona |publisher=Caritas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already on 30 of October 2011, it was celebrated an event in order to "Promoting the dialogue between the cooperative tradition and digital commons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital commons event, 30 October 2011, Barcelona|url=http://www.digital-commons.net/program/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Economy and Consumption Commission of the Barcelona City Council in 2015 started a program on platform cooperativism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fuster|first1=Mayo|title=Presentation Barcelona Collaborative Economy Action Plan - Platform Cooperativism action|url=http://platformcoop.net/2016/participants/mayo-fuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program includes the provision of match funding to support entrepreneurship, and "La Communificadora" an entrepreneurship training and support course, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barcelona Collaborative Economy Action Plan|url=http://emprenedoria.barcelonactiva.cat/emprenedoria/es/edit.do?codiIdioma=2&amp;id=789313&amp;id_activitat_mestre=789313&amp;dia=18&amp;mes=10&amp;any=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
A March 2016 international event by BarCola (node about Collaborative Economy and Commons Based Peer Production in Barcelona) produced a set of 120 policy proposals for European governments. Integrated as concrete actions for the Municipal Action Plan of the Barcelona City Council, following a consultative online participatory process, as well as aiming at other local authorities in Spain and the Government of Catalonia, the resulting document criticized the organizational rationale of "multinational corporations based in Silicon Valley" which, though similar to collaborative-Commons economic models, "behave in the style of the prevailing globalized capitalist economic model, based on extracting profits through networked collaboration".

That joint statement of public policies for the collaborative economy, which integrates a Commons-oriented vision in such emerging paradigm, claimed that by privatizing certain aspects of the collaborative Commons model these companies created "severe inequalities and loss of rights". The organization and participants at the event proposed the creation of favorable regulations for truly collaborative economic models, with measures like the funding of an incubator of new projects in the collaborative economy, including platform cooperativism, as well as the reassigning of public spaces for jointly managed working and manufacturing spaces. Embed in a wider framework of action research for the co-design of public policies, some of these policy proposals have been met with support by members of the Barcelona city government. Outputs from that process have resulted in specific measures like the incubation of new collaborative economy initiatives following a cooperativist model, or the possibility of new funding schemes for civic projects via transparent "match-funding".

===United States===

NYC Council Member Brad Lander of Brooklyn's 39th District, founding co-chair of the Council's Progressive Caucus, released a report in 2016 entitled, "Raising the Floor for Workers in the Gig Economy: Tools for NYC &amp; Beyond,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bradlander.nyc/news/updates/raising-the-floor-for-workers-in-the-gig-economy-tools-for-nyc-beyond |title=Raising the Floor For Workers In The Gig Economy: Tools for NYC &amp; Beyond |date=5 September 2016 |website=Brad Lander |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which analyzes the contingent work sector in New York City and "presents policy tools for cities seeking to protect gig workers from wage theft and discrimination, provide access to portable benefits, and establish new frameworks for worker organizing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://platformcoop.net/2016/participants/brad-lander |title=Brad Lander |website=Platform Cooperativism |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his leadership, the NYC Council unanimously passed the "Freelance Isn't Free Act," which provides freelance workers with a right to full and timely payment, along with new tools for enforcement, and amendments to the NYC Human Rights law to clarify that employment protections apply to independent and contingent workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.freelancersunion.org/2016/11/22/hack-the-union/ |title=Hack the Union talks the passage of Freelance Isn't Free |last=Lee |first=Adaline |date=22 November 2016 |website=Freelancer's Union |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his report, NYC Council Member Brad Lander presented platform cooperativism as a model to help laborers in the digital economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://platformcoop.net/2016/participants/brad-lander |title=Brad Lander |website=Platform Cooperativism |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bradlander.nyc/news/updates/raising-the-floor-for-workers-in-the-gig-economy-tools-for-nyc-beyond |title=Raising the Floor For Workers In The Gig Economy: Tools for NYC &amp; Beyond |date=5 September 2016 |website=Brad Lander |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Department of Agriculture appeared to offer its support for the platform cooperativism movement with a feature story in the September/October 2016 issue of its magazine, Rural Cooperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Borst |first=Alan |date=October 2016 |title=Rural Cooperatives Magazine |url=https://www.rd.usda.gov/files/RD-RuralCoopMagSepOct2016.pdf |location=Washington D.C. |publisher=US Department of Agriculture |chapter='Platform co-ops' gaining traction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Rural Americans have been organizing cooperatives to develop countervailing economic power against larger investor-owned corporations for more than a century. This cooperative movement has now moved into the sharing economy that has been developing throughout the country. Wherever investor-owners of software platforms are satisfying the needs of rural asset owners and users, the sharing economy will be welcomed. However, when need arises, cooperatively owned software platforms are proving to be a viable alternative."

===United Kingdom===

In 2016, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party and the Opposition in the United Kingdom, released a digital democracy manifesto calling for, among other progressive policies, the fostering of "the cooperative ownership of digital platforms for distributing labour and selling services." He proposed that the National Investment Bank, as well as regional banks, would "finance social enterprises whose websites and apps are designed to minimise the costs of connecting producers with consumers in the transport, accommodation, cultural, catering and other important sectors of the British economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/digital_democracy_manifesto |title=Digital democracy manifesto |website=Jeremy Corbyn |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in user hands, Schneider suggested, Twitter could be turned into a platform co-op.

==Criticisms of the viability of platform cooperatives==

===Dominance of established players===

Some critics of platform cooperativism claim that platform cooperatives will have trouble challenging established, venture-capital-funded platforms. Nick Srnicek writes that, due to "the monopolistic nature of platforms, the dominance of network effects, and the vast resources behind these companies … even if all that software would be made open-source, a platform like Facebook would still have the weight of its existing data, network effects, and financial resources to fight off any co-op arrival."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Srnicek |first=Nick |date=2017 |title=Platform Capitalism |url= |location=New York City |publisher=Polity |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rufus Pollock expresses similar concerns that platform coops will face major challenges reaching adequate scale, particularly given their inability to raise traditional equity capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=https://rufuspollock.com/2017/01/11/information-coops-collective-funding-of-information-goods-from-software-to-medicines/|title=Information Coops: Collective Funding of Information Goods from Software to Medicines}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he argues that coops often have slow and inefficient decision-making processes which will hamper them in their ability to compete successfully. Finally, he points out there is the risk that platform coops will go "bad" becoming an exclusive club for their members (for example, a ride-sharing coop might end up controlled only by drivers who then exploit consumers). Evgeny Morozov writes that "Efforts at platform cooperativism are worthwhile; occasionally, they do produce impressive and ethical local projects. There is no reason why a cooperative of drivers in a small town cannot build an app to help them beat Uber locally. But there is also no good reason to believe that this local cooperative can actually build a self-driving car: this requires massive investment and a dedicated infrastructure to harvest and analyse all of the data. One can, of course, also create data ownership cooperatives but it's unlikely they will scale to a point of competing with Google or Amazon."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/04/data-populists-must-seize-information-for-benefit-of-all-evgeny-morozov|title=Data populists must seize our information – for the benefit of us all|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|date=3 December 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=12 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this may be true in certain sectors, Arun Sundararajan claims that, "Economic theory suggests that worker cooperatives are more efficient than shareholder corporations when there isn't a great deal of diversity in the levels of contribution across workers, when the level of external competition is low, and when there isn't the need for frequent investments in response to technological change." Using Uber as an example of a dominant platform, he continues: "Cab drivers, after all, offer a more or less uniform service in an industry with a limited amount of competition. Once the technology associated with 'e-hail' is commoditized, the potential for a worker cooperative appears to be in place, since each local market is contestable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sundararajan |first=Arun |date=2016 |title=The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, the possibility of dominant platforms turning the flows of data they receive from their larger user-bases into market-securing technological innovations remains a challenge. For example, Uber seeks to use the data they currently collect from drivers using their app to automate the taxi industry, thus eliminating the need for their workforce altogether and likely dropping the value of a ride below that on which a human laborer can survive.

===Difficulty securing early-stage capital===

Though Sundararajan believes there are markets in which platform cooperatives might thrive, he finds their primary barrier to entry to be the initial securing of funds, especially given their ideological devaluation of the need to generate profits for investor-stakeholders. He does note, however, that a number of alternative fundraising models may pave the way for the widespread market-entry of platform cooperatives. Among those he mentions is Fairshare, a stakeholder model which differentiates between founders, workers, users, and investors, each with distinct voting rights, payouts, and permissions to trade shares on the open market. Other models he mentions include crypto-coin crowdfunding, philanthropic investment, and "provider stock ownership programs" that mimic the traditional joint-ownership form of the "employee stock ownership program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sundararajan |first=Arun |date=2016 |title=The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11636">The '''Proto-Kam–Sui language''' is the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] ancestor of the [[Kam–Sui languages]].

==Reconstructions==
A preliminary of reconstruction of Proto-Kam–Sui had been undertaken by [[Graham Thurgood]] (1988).&lt;ref name="Thurgood, Graham 1988"&gt;Thurgood, Graham. 1988. "Notes on the reconstruction of Proto-Kam–Sui." In Jerold A. Edmondson and David B. Solnit (eds.), Comparative Kadai: Linguistic studies beyond Tai, 179-218. Summer Institute of Linguistics Publications in Linguistics, 86. Dallas: Summer Institute of Linguistics and the University of Texas at Arlington.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reconstruction of Proto-Kam-Sui, mostly based on Thurgood's reconstruction, was accomplished by Ilia Peiros as part of his reconstruction of Tai-Kadai, which was done without taking the Kra languages into account.&lt;ref name="Peiros, Ilia 1998"&gt;Peiros, Ilia, 1998. "Comparative Linguistics in Southeast Asia", Pacific Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new reconstruction of Proto-Kam-Sui is currently being undertaken by Peter Norquest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1461492 Reconstructing Language Change and Variation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Liang &amp; Zhang (1996)&lt;ref name="Liang1996"&gt;Liang Min 梁敏 &amp; Zhang Junru 张均如. 1996. ''Dongtai yuzu gailun'' 侗台语族概论 / ''An introduction to the Kam–Tai languages''. Beijing: China Social Sciences Academy Press 中国社会科学出版社. {{ISBN|9787500416814}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider western Guangdong to be the original homeland of Proto-Kam-Sui. According to Liang &amp; Zhang (1996:25-29), based on evidence from Chinese written historical records, Kam-Sui languages were originally spoken in western Guangdong, but Kam-Sui peoples later started to migrate out of Guangdong during the [[Sui Dynasty]] and [[Tang Dynasty]] (from the years 600-800). Sui and Maonan migrations were completed by the [[Song Dynasty]], around the years 1000-1100, while the Lakkia migrated to their current location in Guangxi from [[Huaiji County]] and [[Fengkai County]], Guangdong during the beginning of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (years 1300-1400).&lt;ref name="Liang1996"/&gt;

'''''Pyramids of Mars''''' is the third serial of the [[Doctor Who (season 13)|13th season]] of the  British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on [[BBC1]] from 25 October to 15 November 1975.

The serial is set in England and Egypt and on [[Mars]] in 1911. In the serial, the burial chamber of the alien Osiran Sutekh ([[Gabriel Woolf]]), the inspiration for the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian god]] [[Set (deity)|Set]], is unearthed by the archaeology professor Marcus Scarman ([[Bernard Archard]]). Alive but immobilised, Sutekh seeks his freedom by using Professor Scarman as his servant to destroy the jewel on a pyramid on Mars which is keeping him prisoner.

[[File:Giseh 35.jpg|thumb|left|''Pyramids of Mars'' depicts Ancient Egyptian Pyramids as extraterrestrial in origin]]
In 1911 Egypt, an archaeology professor Marcus Scarman excavates a [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramid]] and finds the door to the burial chamber is inscribed with the [[Eye of Horus]]. His Egyptian assistants flee in fear as he entered the chamber alone and is hit by a beam of green light. The [[Fourth Doctor|Doctor]], intended to land in UNIT's base, ends up in the basement of an English estate after the TARDIS was forced out of its flight path as [[Sarah Jane Smith|Sarah]] sees an apparition of a [[Set animal|Typhonian Animal]] in the console room. The two are found by the butler, who reveals they are in the Scarman estate which has been taken over by a mysterious Egyptian named Ibrahim Namin claiming to represent Scarman's estate, Scarman's friend Dr Warlock confronting him over foul play. When Namin sends a robot dressed like an [[Egyptian mummy]] after them and Warlock, they reach a hunting lodge used by Scarman's brother Laurence, whose [[Guglielmo Marconi|marconiscope]] intercepted a signal from [[Mars]]. The Doctor decodes the signal as "Beware [[List of Doctor Who villains#Sutekh|Sutekh]]", explaining to Sarah that Sutekh is the last of a powerful [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] race called the Osirans, his imprisonment by his brother [[Horus]] being the inspiration for ancient [[Egyptian mythology]].

Namin and the mummies greet the arrival of Sutekh's servant who travels to the priory via a [[Portals in fiction|spacetime tunnel portal]] disguised as[[sarcophagus]], the servant killing Namin for serving his purpose. The servant is revealed to be Marcus Scarman, whom the Doctor realizes is a corpse animated by Sutekh's will. As Scarman and the robots secure the estate's perimeter while killing off anyone they find like Warlock before constructing an Osirian war missile aimed for Mars, Doctor disrupts the tunnel using the TARDIS key before retrieving Namin's ring from his corpse. Hiding in the TARDIS, Sarah suggests they should just leave with the Doctor briefly taking them to 1980 to show what becomes of Earth if they allow Sutekh to escape.

[[File:Berlin 122009 018a.jpg|thumb|The extraterrestrial Sutekh is said to be the origin of the Egyptian deity [[Set (deity)|Set]]]]
Once back in 1911, the Doctor makes a jamming unit with Namin's ring to break Sutekh's hold over those animated by his will including Scarman, causing Laurence to attempt stopping him from activating the device. The robots chasing after the groundskeeper Clements kill him before they overrun the hunting lodge, one shutting down after destroying the machine while Sarah uses Namin's ring to send the other back to Scarman. The Doctor decides to blow up the partially assembled rocket, Laurence suggesting the blasting [[gelignite]] kept in Clements's hut. The Doctor and Sarah leave to obtain the gelignite, ordering Laurence to strip the bindings from the deactivated robot. When Scarman arrives, Laurence attempts to rekindle his brother's humanity and ends up being killed. After he and Sarah return, the Doctor disguises himself under the robot's binding to set up the explosives before he and Sarah detonate them. But Sutekh [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] suppresses the explosion, forcing the Doctor to use space-time tunnel to reach Sutekh and break his concentration for the explosion to run its course. A furious Sutekh interrogates the Doctor before decides to turn him into a thrall to transport Scarman to a Martian pyramid to destroy the Eye of Horus which maintains his prison. 

Though strangled once serving his purpose, the Doctor survived through his respiratory bypass system as he and Sarah follow Scarman through a series of locked chambers which are dependent upon solving logical and philosophical puzzles. While the Doctor is unable to stop Scarman from destroying the Eye, Scarman decaying to dust, he realizes that Sutekh would not be released for two minutes due to the time of the Eye's [[speed of light|signal]] traveling from Mars to Earth. The Doctor returns to the Priory and use a module from the TARDIS on Sutekh as he was traveling the space-time tunnel, subjecting the Osirian to rapid aging until his
body dissolves once aged passed 11,000 years. But the Doctor's action causes the portal to overload with him and Sarah fleeing into the TARDIS as the priory is consumed in flames.

===Continuity===
Sarah wears a dress which the Doctor says belonged to [[Victoria Waterfield|Victoria]].&lt;ref name="discontinuity"/&gt; She remarks that the puzzles are similar to those in the Exxilon City in ''[[Death to the Daleks]]'' (1974), although she personally never entered the City.&lt;ref name="discontinuity"/&gt;

==Production==
The story as originally written by Lewis Greifer was considered unworkable. As Greifer was unavailable to perform rewrites, the scripts were completely rewritten by [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]]. The pseudonym used on transmission was Stephen Harris. ''Pyramids of Mars'' contributes to the [[UNIT#UNIT dating|UNIT dating controversy]], one of the contradictions in the ''Doctor Who'' universe.

The exterior scenes were shot on the [[Stargroves]] estate in [[Hampshire]], a Victorian mansion noted for its ornate, [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival]] style of architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1339802|desc=Stargrove|access-date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was owned by [[Mick Jagger]] at the time. The same location would be used during the filming of ''[[Image of the Fendahl]]'' (1977). The new [[TARDIS]] console, which debuted in the preceding story ''[[Planet of Evil]]'', does not appear again until ''[[The Invisible Enemy (Doctor Who)|The Invisible Enemy]]'' (1977). Owing to the cost of setting up the TARDIS console room for the filming of only a handful of scenes, a new console set was designed for the following season. Tom Baker and Elisabeth Sladen improvised a number of moments in this story, most notably a scene in Part Four where the Doctor and Sarah start to walk out of their hiding place and then when they see a mummy, quickly dart back into it. Baker based the scene on a [[Marx Brothers]] routine.

Several scenes were deleted from the final broadcast. A model shot of the TARDIS landing in the landscape of a barren, alternative 1980 Earth was to be used in Part Two, but director Paddy Russell decided viewers would feel more impact if the first scene of the new Earth was Sarah's reaction as the TARDIS doors opened. Three scenes of effects such as doors opening and the Doctor materializing from the [[sarcophagus]] were removed from the final edit of Part Four because Russell felt the mixes were not good enough. These scenes were included on the DVD, along with an alternate version of the poacher being hunted down in Part Two, and a full version of the Osiran rocket explosion.

Although the name of Sutekh's race is pronounced "Osiran" throughout the serial, the scripts and publicity material spell it as "Osirian" in some places and as "Osiran" in others.&lt;ref name="television companion"&gt;{{cite book

===Cast notes===
The story features a guest appearance by Michael Sheard; he was cast by director [[Paddy Russell]] without any audition, purely on the recommendation of production assistant [[Peter Grimwade]]. Sheard previously featured in ''[[The Ark (Doctor Who)|The Ark]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Mind of Evil]]'' (1971) and would later appear in ''[[The Invisible Enemy (Doctor Who)|The Invisible Enemy]]'' (1977), ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]'' (1982) and ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' (1988). [[Bernard Archard]]  previously played Bragen in ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'' (1966). [[Michael Bilton]] previously played Teligny in ''[[The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve]]'' (1966). George Tovey was the father of [[Roberta Tovey]], who appeared as [[Susan Foreman|Susan]] in the films ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'' (1965) and ''[[Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.]]'' (1966).

Gabriel Woolf reprised his role as Sutekh in the ''[[Faction Paradox]]'' audio dramas ''Coming to Dust'' (2005), ''The Ship of a Billion Years'' (2006), ''Body Politic'' (2008), ''Words from Nine Divinities'' (2008), ''Ozymandias'' (2009) and ''The Judgment of Sutekh'' (2009), from [[Magic Bullet Productions]] and in ''The New Adventures of Bernice Summerfield: The Judgement of Sutekh'' for [[Big Finish Productions]]. He also provided the voice of Sutekh for the comedy sketch ''Oh Mummy: Sutekh's Story'', included on the DVD release of ''Pyramids of Mars''. Woolf would go on to provide the voice of [[List of Doctor Who villains#Beast|The Beast]] in the 2006 episodes "[[The Impossible Planet]]" and "[[The Satan Pit]]". He also provided the voice of Governor Rossitor in the Big Finish audio plays ''[[Arrangements for War]]'' and ''[[Thicker than Water (audio drama)|Thicker than Water]]''.

[[File:The Mummy 1932 film poster.jpg|thumb|''Pyramids of Mars'' is considered to have been heavily influenced by Gothic horror films such as ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932)]]
The story was edited and condensed into a single, one-hour omnibus episode, broadcast on BBC1 at 5:50 pm on 27 November 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e32b3e8500bc4815b3dbce1d80d9e902|title=Dr Who: Pyramids of Mars|date=25 November 1976|publisher=|issue=2768|pages=19|via=BBC Genome}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching 13.7 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.doctorwhonews.net/story.php?story=PyramidsofMars&amp;detail=broadcast|title=Doctor Who Guide: broadcasting for Pyramids of Mars|first=|last=doctorwhonews.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest audience achieved by Doctor Who in its entire history to date. The figure was not bettered until the broadcast of ''City of Death'' in 1979. BBC2 broadcast the four episodes on consecutive Sundays from 6–27 March 1994 at noon, reaching 1.1, 1.1, 0.9 &amp; 1.0 million viewers respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.doctorwhonews.net/story.php?story=PyramidsofMars&amp;detail=broadcast&amp;page=2|title=Doctor Who Guide: broadcasting for Pyramids of Mars|first=|last=doctorwhonews.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Cornell]], [[Martin Day]], and [[Keith Topping]] gave the serial a positive review in ''The Discontinuity Guide'' (1995), praising the "chilling" adversary and some of the conversations.&lt;ref name="discontinuity"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Discontinuity Guide]] |last1=Cornell |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Cornell |last2=Day |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Day |last3=Topping |first3=Keith |authorlink3=Keith Topping |year=1995 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |location=London |isbn=0-426-20442-5 |pages= |chapter=Pyramids of Mars|chapterurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/pyramidsmars/detail.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The Television Companion'' (1998), [[David J. Howe]] and Stephen James Walker described the first episode as "an excellent scene-setter" and the story as "near-flawless". They wrote that ''Pyramids of Mars'' gave the "fullest expression" of the [[Gothic horror]] era and had high production values and a good guest cast.&lt;ref name="television companion"/&gt; In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of ''[[Radio Times]]'' called it "a bona fide classic" with "arguably the most polished production to date", and praised the powerful plot. However, he disliked how UNIT was dismissed in the season, and found "minor, amusing quibbles" with the plot.&lt;ref name="Radio Times"&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick|last=Mulkern|url= http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2010-07-14/doctor-who-pyramids-of-mars|title=Doctor Who: Pyramids of Mars|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=14 July 2010|access-date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlie Anders|Charlie Jane Anders]] of [[io9]] described ''Pyramids of Mars'' as "just a lovely, solid adventure story", highlighting the way the Doctor seemed outmatched, the pace, and Sarah Jane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Charlie Jane|last=Anders|url=http://io9.com/5939314/old+school-doctor-who-episodes-that-everyone-should-watch|title=Old-School Doctor Who Episodes That Everyone Should Watch|publisher=[[io9]]|date=30 August 2012|access-date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 article, Anders also listed the cliffhanger to the third episode&amp;nbsp;— in which the Doctor is forced to confront Sutekh&amp;nbsp;— as one of the greatest ''Doctor Who'' cliffhangers ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Charlie Jane|last=Anders|url=http://io9.com/5625151/greatest-doctor-who-cliffhangers-of-all-time|title=Greatest Doctor Who Cliffhangers Of All Time!|publisher=[[io9]]|date=31 August 2010|access-date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' poll to determine the best ''Doctor Who'' stories of all time, readers voted ''Pyramids of Mars'' to eighth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Top 10 Doctor Who stories of all time|url=http://www.doctorwhomagazine.com/the-top-10-doctor-who-stories-of-all-time/|access-date=21 August 2014|publisher=Doctor Who Magazine|date=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer [[John Kenneth Muir]] was critical of the serial, querying the [[Egyptian mythology]] [[conceit]] that is woven through the whole story; he questioned a number of apparently illogical story elements, such as why the robots that guard the priory were disguised as [[Egyptian mummies]], and why the Osiran rocket was shaped as a pyramid. In his assessment, the use of ancient Egyptian objects and symbols by the Osiran race was inadequately explained in the script, and he contrasted the ''Pyramids of Mars'' unfavourably with ''[[Stargate]]'', a 1994 television series which relied heavily on the concept of [[ancient astronauts]] visiting Earth. Muir traced parallels with earlier ''Doctor Who'' serials such as ''[[The Dæmons]]'' (1971) and ''[[Terror of the Zygons]]'' (1975) which had also drawn on the idea of ancient Earth mythologies having extraterrestrial origins. Like ''The Dæmons'' and ''[[Tomb of the Cybermen]]'' (1967), ''Pyramids of Mars'' exploited many familiar conventions of classic [[Mummy (undead)|mummy films]], but less successfully in Muir's view.&lt;ref name="muir"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muir|first1=John Kenneth|title=A Critical History of Doctor Who on Television|date=2007|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476604541|pages=237-241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMKSCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA223&amp;dq=doctor%20who%20robot%20king%20kong&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en|chapter=Season 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John J Johnston, vice-chair of the [[Egypt Exploration Society]], explored the influences on the ''Pyramids of Mars'' in the ''Encyclopedia of Mummies in History, Religion, and Popular Culture''. He argued that the story drew heavily on a number of classic horror films such as [[Boris Karloff]]'s ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932) and [[Hammer Films]]' ''[[The Mummy (1959 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1959), in its setting and the performance of the actors. Johnston also noted the influences of [[archaeology]] on the [[production design]]. According to Johnston, the robot mummies designed by the BBC's Barbara Kidd were inspired by an ancient rock painting of a mysterious domed-headed figure that had been discovered by [[Henri Lhote]] in the [[Sahara Desert]] in the 1950s, and which Lhote had nicknamed "the Great Martian God". Similarly, he considered Sutekh's mask to have been modelled on a [[:File:Bearded man-MGR Lyon-IMG 9929 c.jpg|statue of a bearded man]] dating from c.3500 BCE that had been excavated at [[Gebelein]] by [[:fr:Louis Charles Émile Lortet|Louis Lortet]] in 1908.&lt;ref name="Cardin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=John J|title=Mummies around the World: An Encyclopedia of Mummies in History, Religion, and Popular Culture|date=2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610694209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AWJhBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;ots=FcvO2uekaW&amp;dq=pyramids%20of%20mars%20the%20mummy%201932&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|access-date=9 November 2016|language=en|chapter=Doctor Who: Pyramids of Mars|editor1-last=Cardin|editor1-first=Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3555">The '''Ratio Club''' was a small informal [[dining club]] of young [[psychiatrists]], [[psychology|psychologists]], [[physiology|physiologists]], [[mathematics|mathematicians]] and [[engineering|engineers]] who met to discuss issues in [[cybernetics]].

The idea of the club arose from a [[symposium]] on [[animal behaviour]] held in July 1949 by the Society of Experimental [[Biology]] in [[Cambridge]].  The club was founded by the [[neurology|neurologist]] [[John Bates (neurophysiologist)|John Bates]], with other notable members such as [[W. Ross Ashby]].

The name ''Ratio'' was suggested by Albert Uttley, it being the Latin root meaning "computation or the faculty of mind which calculates, plans and reasons". He pointed out that it is also the root of ''rationarium'', meaning a statistical account, and ''ratiocinatius'', meaning argumentative.  The use was probably inspired by an earlier suggestion by [[Donald MacCrimmon MacKay|Donald Mackay]] of the 'MR club', from ''Machina ratiocinatrix'', a term used by [[Norbert Wiener]] in the introduction to his then recently published book ''[[Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine]]''. Wiener used the term in reference to ''calculus ratiocinator'', a calculating machine constructed by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].

The initial membership was William Ross Ashby, [[Horace Barlow]], John Bates, George Dawson, [[Thomas Gold]], [[W. E. Hick]], Victor Little, [[Donald MacCrimmon MacKay|Donald MacKay]], Turner McLardy, P. A. Merton, John Pringle, Harold Shipton, Donald Sholl, [[Eliot Slater]], Albert Uttley, [[William Grey Walter|W. Grey Walter]] and [[John Westcott|John Hugh Westcott]]. [[Alan Turing]] joined after the first meeting with [[I. J. Good]], [[Philip Woodward]] and [[W. A. H. Rushton|William Rushton]] added soon after. [[Giles Brindley]] was also a member for a short period.

The club was the most intellectually powerful and influential cybernetics grouping in the UK, and many of its members went on to become extremely prominent scientists.

[[Aristotle]] defines rhetoric as "the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of [[persuasion]]" and since mastery of the art was necessary for victory in a case at law or for passage of proposals in the assembly or for fame as a speaker in civic ceremonies, calls it "a combination of the science of logic and of the ethical branch of politics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.public.iastate.edu/~honeyl/Rhetoric/rhet1-4.html Aristotle's Rhetoric, Book I, Chapter 2, Section 1359 (trans.

The [[Canon (basic principle)|five canons]] of rhetoric or phases of developing a persuasive speech were first codified in classical Rome: [[inventio]]n, [[Dispositio|arrangement]], [[Elocutio|style]], [[Memoria|memory]], and [[Pronuntiatio|delivery]].

From [[Ancient Greece]] to the late 19th century, rhetoric, which along with [[grammar]] and [[logic]] (or [[dialectic]]&amp;nbsp;– see [[Martianus Capella]]) is one of the [[Trivium|three ancient arts of discourse]], played a central role in Western education in training orators, lawyers, counsellors, historians, statesmen, and poets.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Thomas Conley, Rhetoric in the European Tradition ([[University of Chicago]], 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The definition of rhetoric is a controversial subject within the field and has given rise to philological battles over its meaning in Ancient Greece.

==Uses==

===Scope===
Scholars have debated the scope of rhetoric since ancient times. Although some have limited rhetoric to the specific realm of political discourse, many modern scholars liberate it to encompass every aspect of culture. Contemporary studies of rhetoric address a much more diverse range of domains than was the case in ancient times. While classical rhetoric trained speakers to be effective persuaders in public forums and institutions such as courtrooms and assemblies, contemporary rhetoric investigates human discourse [[wikt:writ large|writ large]]. Rhetoricians have studied the discourses of a wide variety of domains, including the natural and social sciences, fine art, religion, journalism, digital media, fiction, history, cartography, and architecture, along with the more traditional domains of politics and the law.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Nelson, Allan Megill, and Donald N. McCloskey ''[http://hhs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/citation/3/2/305?ck=nck The Rhetoric of Human Sciences: Language and Argument in Scholarship and Public Affairs]'', London: University of Wisconsin Press, 1987. ;
"In the last ten years, many scholars have investigated exactly how rhetoric works within a particular field."

(1998) ''Tropes of Politics'' (Madison, University of Wisconsin Press); Brown, R. H. (1987) ''Society as Text'' (Chicago, [[University of Chicago Press]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary approaches treat rhetoric as human communication that includes purposeful and strategic manipulation of symbols. Public relations, lobbying, law, marketing, professional and technical writing, and advertising are modern professions that employ rhetorical practitioners.

Because the ancient Greeks highly valued public political participation, rhetoric emerged as a crucial tool to influence politics. Consequently, rhetoric remains associated with its political origins. However, even the original instructors of Western speech—the [[Sophists]]—disputed this limited view of rhetoric.  According to the Sophists, such as [[Gorgias]], a successful rhetorician could speak convincingly on any topic, regardless of his experience in that field. This method suggested rhetoric could be a means of communicating any expertise, not just politics. In his ''[[Encomium to Helen]]'', Gorgias even applied rhetoric to fiction by seeking for his own pleasure to prove the blamelessness of the mythical [[Helen of Troy]] in starting the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosamond Kent Sprague, ed., "The Older Sophists: A Complete Translations by Several Hands of the Fragments" in ''Die Fragmente Der Vorsokratiker'', Edited by Diels-Kranz (Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina Press, 1972), 50–54&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking to another key rhetorical theorist, [[Plato]] defined the scope of rhetoric according to his negative opinions of the art.  He criticized the Sophists for using rhetoric as a means of deceit instead of discovering truth.  In "Gorgias", one of his [[Socratic Dialogues]], Plato defines rhetoric as the persuasion of ignorant masses within the courts and assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, "Gorgias," [http://www.classicallibrary.org/plato/dialogues/15_gorgias.htm The Classical Library]&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetoric, in Plato's opinion, is merely a form of flattery and functions similarly to cookery, which masks the undesirability of unhealthy food by making it taste good.  Thus, Plato considered any speech of lengthy [[prose]] aimed at flattery as within the scope of rhetoric.

Aristotle both redeemed rhetoric from his teacher and narrowed its focus by defining three genres of rhetoric—[[deliberative]], [[forensic rhetoric|forensic]] or judicial, and [[epideictic]].&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Christof. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/#agenda Aristotle's Rhetoric&amp;nbsp;– The Agenda of the Rhetoric]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, even as he provided order to existing rhetorical theories, Aristotle extended the definition of rhetoric, calling it the ability to identify the appropriate means of persuasion in a given situation, thereby making rhetoric applicable to all fields, not just politics. When one considers that rhetoric included torture (in the sense that the practice of torture is a form of persuasion or coercion), it is clear that rhetoric cannot be viewed only in academic terms. However, the [[enthymeme]] based upon [[logic]] (especially, based upon the syllogism) was viewed as the basis of rhetoric.

However, since the time of Aristotle, logic has changed. For example, [[Modal logic]] has undergone a major development that also modifies rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;George A. Kennedy, ''Aristotle, On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, Aristotle also outlined generic constraints that focused the rhetorical art squarely within the domain of public political practice.  He restricted rhetoric to the domain of the [[contingent]] or probable: those matters that admit multiple legitimate opinions or arguments.

The contemporary [[neo-Aristotelian]] and [[neo-Sophistic]] positions on rhetoric mirror the division between the Sophists and Aristotle.  Neo-Aristotelians generally study rhetoric as political discourse, while the neo-Sophistic view contends that rhetoric cannot be so limited.  Rhetorical scholar [[Michael Leff]] characterizes the conflict between these positions as viewing rhetoric as a "thing contained" versus a "container". The neo-Aristotelian view threatens the study of rhetoric by restraining it to such a limited field, ignoring many critical applications of rhetorical theory, criticism, and practice. Simultaneously, the neo-Sophists threaten to expand rhetoric beyond a point of coherent theoretical value.

Over the past century, people studying rhetoric have tended to enlarge its object domain beyond speech texts.  [[Kenneth Burke]] asserted humans use rhetoric to resolve conflicts by identifying shared characteristics and interests in symbols.  By nature, humans engage in [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], either to identify themselves or another individual with a group.  This definition of [[Identification in rhetoric|rhetoric as identification]] broadened the scope from strategic and overt political persuasion to the more implicit tactics of identification found in an immense range of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Burke, ''A Rhetoric of Motives,'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many scholars who have since pursued Burke's line of thought, [[James Boyd White]] sees rhetoric as a broader domain of social experience in his notion of [[constitutive rhetoric]].  Influenced by theories of [[social construction]], White argues that culture is "reconstituted" through language.  Just as language influences people, people influence language.  Language is socially constructed, and depends on the meanings people attach to it.  Because language is not rigid and changes depending on the situation, the very usage of language is rhetorical. An author, White would say, is always trying to construct a new world and persuading his or her readers to share that world within the text.&lt;ref&gt;James Boyd White, ''When Words Lose Their Meaning'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals engage in the rhetorical process anytime they speak or produce meaning.  Even in the field of [[science]], the practices of which were once viewed as being merely the objective testing and reporting of knowledge, scientists must persuade their audience to accept their findings by sufficiently demonstrating that their study or experiment was conducted reliably and resulted in sufficient evidence to support their conclusions.

The vast scope of rhetoric is difficult to define; however, political discourse remains, in many ways, the paradigmatic example for studying and theorizing specific techniques and conceptions of persuasion, considered by many a synonym for "rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Leff, "The Habitation of Rhetoric" in ''Contemporary Rhetorical Theory: A Reader'', ed. John Louis Lucaites, et al. (New York: Guilford Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a civic art===
Throughout [[European History]], rhetoric has concerned itself with persuasion in public and political settings such as assemblies and courts. Because of its associations with democratic institutions, rhetoric is commonly said to flourish in open and democratic societies with rights of [[free speech]], free assembly, and political enfranchisement for some portion of the population. Those who classify rhetoric as a civic art believe that rhetoric has the power to shape communities, form the character of citizens and greatly effect civic life.

Rhetoric was viewed as a civic art by several of the ancient philosophers. Aristotle and [[Isocrates]] were two of the first to see rhetoric in this light. In his work, [[Antidosis]], Isocrates states, "We have come together and founded cities and made laws and invented arts; and, generally speaking, there is no institution devised by man which the power of speech has not helped us to establish." With this statement he argues that rhetoric is a fundamental part of civic life in every society and that it has been necessary in the foundation of all aspects of society. He further argues in his piece [[Against the Sophists]] that rhetoric, although it cannot be taught to just anyone, is capable of shaping the character of man. He writes, "I do think that the study of political discourse can help more than any other thing to stimulate and form such qualities of character." Aristotle, writing several years after Isocrates, supported many of his arguments and continued to make arguments for rhetoric as a civic art.

In the words of Aristotle, in the ''Rhetoric'', rhetoric is "...&amp;nbsp;the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion". According to Aristotle, this art of persuasion could be used in public settings in three different ways. He writes in Book&amp;nbsp;I, Chapter&amp;nbsp;III, "A member of the assembly decides about future events, a juryman about past events: while those who merely decide on the orator's skill are observers. From this it follows that there are three divisions of oratory&amp;nbsp;–  (1) political, (2) forensic, and (3) the ceremonial oratory of display". Eugene Garver, in his critique of "Aristotle's Rhetoric", confirms that Aristotle viewed rhetoric as a civic art. Garver writes, "Rhetoric articulates a civic art of rhetoric, combining the almost incompatible properties of techne and appropriateness to citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Garver, Eugene. ''Aristotle's Rhetoric''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of Aristotle's divisions plays a role in civic life and can be used in a different way to affect cities.

Because rhetoric is a public art capable of shaping opinion, some of the ancients including [[Plato]] found fault in it. They claimed that while it could be used to improve civic life, it could be used equally easily to deceive or manipulate with negative effects on the city. The masses were incapable of analyzing or deciding anything on their own and would therefore be swayed by the most persuasive speeches. Thus, civic life could be controlled by the one who could deliver the best speech. Plato explores the problematic moral status of rhetoric twice: in ''[[Gorgias]]'', a [[dialogue]] named for the famed Sophist, and in ''The [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', a dialogue best known for its commentary on love. This concern is still maintained to nowadays.

More trusting in the power of rhetoric to support a republic, the Roman orator [[Cicero]] argued that art required something more than eloquence. A good orator needed also to be a good man, a person enlightened on a variety of civic topics. He describes the proper training of the orator in his major text on rhetoric, ''[[De Oratore]]'', modeled on Plato's dialogues.

Modern day works continue to support the claims of the ancients that rhetoric is an art capable of influencing civic life. In his work ''Political Style'', [[Robert Hariman]] claims, "Furthermore, questions of freedom, equality, and justice often are raised and addressed through performances ranging from debates to demonstrations without loss of moral content".&lt;ref&gt;Hariman, Robert. ''Political Style: The Artistry of Power''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Boyd White]] argues further that rhetoric is capable not only of addressing issues of political interest but that it can influence culture as a whole. In his book, ''When Words Lose Their Meaning'', he argues that words of persuasion and identification define community and civic life. He states that words produce "the methods by which culture is maintained, criticized, and transformed".&lt;ref&gt;White, James B. ''When Words Lose Their Meaning''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1984. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Both White and Hariman agree that words and rhetoric have the power to shape culture and civic life.

In modern times, rhetoric has consistently remained relevant as a civic art. In speeches, as well as in non-verbal forms, rhetoric continues to be used as a tool to influence communities from local to national levels.

===As a course of study===
Rhetoric as a course of study has evolved significantly since its ancient beginnings.  Through the ages, the study and teaching of rhetoric has adapted to the particular exigencies of the time and venue.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, George A. ''Classical Rhetoric &amp; Its Christian and Secular Tradition''. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study of rhetoric has conformed to a multitude of different applications, ranging from architecture to literature.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, Brian. "Deconstruction's Designs on Rhetoric." ''Rhetoric and Pedagogy: Its History, Philosophy, and Practice''. Ed. Winifred Bryan Horner and Michael Leff. 295–315.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the curriculum has transformed in a number of ways, it has generally emphasized the study of principles and rules of composition as a means for moving audiences. Generally speaking, the study of rhetoric trains students to speak and/or write effectively, as well as critically understand and analyze discourse.

Rhetoric began as a civic art in Ancient Greece where students were trained to develop tactics of oratorical persuasion, especially in legal disputes. Rhetoric originated in a school of [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers known as the [[Sophists]] circa 600 BC. [[Demosthenes]] and [[Lysias]] emerged as major orators during this period, and [[Isocrates]] and [[Gorgias]] as prominent teachers.  Rhetorical education focused on five particular canons: ''inventio'' (invention), ''dispositio'' (arrangement), ''elocutio'' (style), ''memoria'' (memory), and ''actio'' (delivery).  Modern teachings continue to reference these rhetorical leaders and their work in discussions of classical rhetoric and persuasion.

Rhetoric was later taught in universities during the [[Middle Ages]] as one of the three original [[liberal arts]] or [[trivium (education)|trivium]] (along with [[logic]] and [[grammar]]).&lt;ref&gt;cf. Conley, T.M. (1990) ''Rhetoric in the European Tradition''. (University of Chicago Press.; Kennedy, G.A., 1994). ''A New History of Classical Rhetoric''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; During the medieval period, political rhetoric declined as republican oratory died out and the emperors of Rome garnered increasing authority.  With the rise of European monarchs in following centuries, rhetoric shifted into the courtly and religious applications.  [[Augustine]] exerted strong influence on Christian rhetoric in the Middle Ages, advocating the use of rhetoric to lead audiences to truth and understanding, especially in the church.  The study of liberal arts, he believed, contributed to rhetorical study: "In the case of a keen and ardent nature, fine words will come more readily through reading and hearing the eloquent than by pursuing the rules of rhetoric."&lt;ref&gt;"Rhetoric." Augnet. n.p., 2010. Web. 12 April 2010.

"Rhetoric and Poetics in the Early Middle Ages." ''Rhetorica'' 5.2 (1987): 131. {{doi|10.1525/rh.1987.5.2.129}}. {{JSTOR|10.1525/rh.1987.5.2.129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Letter writing was the primary form through which business was conducted both in state and church, so it became an important aspect of rhetorical education.&lt;ref name="bedfordstmartins.com"&gt;"A Brief History of Rhetoric and Composition." ''The Bedford Bibliography for Teachers of Writing''. Bedford/St. Martin's, n.d. Web. 12 April 2010. [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/bb/history.html Bedfordstmartins.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516061220/http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/bb/history.html |date=16 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorical education became more restrained as style and substance separated in 16th-century France with [[Peter Ramus]], and attention turned to the scientific method. That is, influential scholars like Ramus argued that the processes of invention and arrangement should be elevated to the domain of philosophy, while rhetorical instruction should be chiefly concerned with the use of figures and other forms of the ornamentation of language. Scholars such as [[Francis Bacon]] developed the study of "scientific rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;Zappen, James P. "Francis Bacon and the Historiography of Scientific Rhetoric." ''Rhetoric Review'' 8.1 (1989): 74–88. {{JSTOR|465682}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This concentration rejected the elaborate style characteristic of the classical oration.  This plain language carried over to [[John Locke]]'s teaching, which emphasized concrete knowledge and steered away from ornamentation in speech, further alienating rhetorical instruction, which was identified wholly with this ornamentation, from the pursuit of knowledge.

In the 18th century, rhetoric assumed a more social role, initiating the creation of new education systems.  "[[Elocution]] schools" arose (predominantly in England) in which females analyzed classic literature, most notably the works of [[William Shakespeare]], and discussed pronunciation tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul C. "Elocution and Shakespeare: An Episode in the History of Literary Taste." ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' 35.3 (1984): 305–14. {{doi|10.2307/2870367}}. {{JSTOR|2870367}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of rhetoric underwent a revival with the rise of democratic institutions during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  Scotland's author and theorist [[Hugh Blair]] served as a key leader of this movement during the late 18th century.  In his most famous work "Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres", he advocates rhetorical study for common citizens as a resource for social success.  Many American colleges and secondary schools used Blair's text throughout the 19th century to train students of rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;"A Brief History of Rhetoric and Composition." ''The Bedford Bibliography for Teachers of Writing''. Bedford/St. Martin's, n.d. Web. 12 April 2010.

Political rhetoric also underwent renewal in the wake of the US and French revolutions.  The rhetorical studies of ancient Greece and Rome were resurrected in the studies of the era as speakers and teachers looked to [[Cicero]] and others to inspire defense of the new republic.  Leading rhetorical theorists included [[John Quincy Adams]] of [[Harvard]] who advocated the democratic advancement of rhetorical art.  Harvard's founding of the Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory sparked the growth of rhetorical study in colleges across the United States.&lt;ref name="bedfordstmartins.com"/&gt; Harvard's rhetoric program drew inspiration from literary sources to guide organization and style. Recently, there have been studies conducted examining the rhetoric used in political speech acts to illustrate how political figures will persuade audiences for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://apo.org.au/files/Resource/j_roffee_rhetoric_aboriginal_australians_2016.pdf |author=Roffee, J.

Debate clubs and lyceums also developed as forums in which common citizens could hear speakers and sharpen debate skills.  The American lyceum in particular was seen as both an educational and social institution, featuring group discussions and guest lecturers.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Angela G. The Lyceum and Public Culture in the Nineteenth-Century United States. (East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 2005), 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;  These programs cultivated democratic values and promoted active participation in political analysis.

Throughout the 20th century, rhetoric developed as a concentrated field of study with the establishment of rhetorical courses in high schools and universities.  Courses such as [[public speaking]] and [[speech analysis]] apply fundamental Greek theories (such as the modes of persuasion: [[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]]) as well as trace rhetorical development throughout the course of history.  Rhetoric has earned a more esteemed reputation as a field of study with the emergence of [[Communication Studies]] departments as well as Rhetoric and Composition programs within English departments in universities and in conjunction with the linguistic turn.  Rhetorical study has broadened in scope, and is especially utilized by the fields of marketing, politics, and literature.

Rhetoric, as an area of study, is concerned with how humans use symbols, especially language, to reach agreement that permits coordinated effort of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hauser| first = Gerard| authorlink = Gerard Hauser| title = Introduction to Rhetorical Theory| publisher = [[Waveland Press]]| location = Illinois| year = 2002| page = 2|isbn = 978-1-57766-221-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]], the first university in the United States, based on the European model, taught a basic curriculum, including rhetoric.  Rhetoric, in this sense, how to properly give speeches, played an important role in their training. Rhetoric was soon taught in departments of English as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Borchers | first1 = Timothy A. | title = Rhetorical Theory: An Introduction (with InfoTrac) | year = 2006  | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = Canada | isbn = 0-534-63918-6 | page = 21  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge===
The relationship between rhetoric and knowledge is an old and interesting philosophical problem, partly because of our different assumptions on the nature of knowledge. But it is fairly clear that while knowledge is primarily concerned with what is commonly known as "truth", rhetoric is primarily concerned with statements and their effects on the audience. The word "rhetoric" may also refer to "empty speak", which reflects an indifference to truth, and in this sense rhetoric is adversarial to knowledge. Plato famously criticized the Sophists for their rhetoric which had persuaded people to sentence his friend Socrates to death regardless of what was true. However, rhetoric is also used in the construction of true arguments, or in identifying what is relevant, the crux of the matter, in a selection of true but otherwise trivial statements. Hence, rhetoric is also closely related to knowledge.

The [[Egyptians]] held eloquent speaking in high esteem, and it was a skill that had a very high value in their society. The "Egyptian rules of rhetoric" also clearly specified that "knowing when not to speak is essential, and very respected, rhetorical knowledge". Their "approach to rhetoric" was thus a "balance between eloquence and wise silence". Their rules of speech also strongly emphasized "adherence to social behaviors that support a conservative status quo" and they held that "skilled speech should support, not question, society".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Ancient Egyptian Rhetoric in the Old and Middle Kingdoms |author=David Hutto‌ |journal=[[Rhetorica]] |date=Summer 2002| volume=20| issue=3| publisher=[[University of California Press]]| pages=213–33| doi=10.1525/rh.2002.20.3.213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient China]], rhetoric dates back to the [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]], [[Confucius]] (551–479 BC), and continued with later followers.

In [[ancient Greece]], the earliest mention of oratorical skill occurs in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', where heroes like [[Achilles]], [[Hector]], and [[Odysseus]] were honored for their ability to advise and exhort their peers and followers (the ''Laos'' or army) in wise and appropriate action.  With the rise of the democratic ''polis'', speaking skill was adapted to the needs of the public and political life of cities in ancient Greece, much of which revolved around the use of [[oratory (speech)|oratory]] as the medium through which political and judicial decisions were made, and through which philosophical ideas were developed and disseminated.  For modern students today, it can be difficult to remember that the wide use and availability of written texts is a phenomenon that was just coming into vogue in [[Classical Greece]].  In Classical times, many of the great thinkers and political leaders performed their works before an audience, usually in the context of a competition or contest for fame, political influence, and cultural capital; in fact, many of them are known only through the texts that their students, followers, or detractors wrote down.  As has already been noted, ''rhetor'' was the Greek term for ''orator:''  A ''rhetor'' was a citizen who regularly addressed juries and political assemblies and who was thus understood to have gained some knowledge about public speaking in the process, though in general facility with language was often referred to as ''logôn techne'', "skill with arguments" or "verbal artistry".&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Mogens Herman Hansen]] The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes (Blackwell, 1991); Josiah Ober ''Mass and Elite in Democratic Athens'' (Princeton UP, 1989); Jeffrey Walker, "Rhetoric and Poetics in Antiquity;" (Oxford UP, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetoric thus evolved as an important art, one that provided the orator with the forms, means, and strategies for persuading an audience of the correctness of the orator's arguments. Today the term ''rhetoric'' can be used at times to refer only to the form of argumentation, often with the pejorative connotation that rhetoric is a means of obscuring the truth. Classical [[philosopher]]s believed quite the contrary: the skilled use of rhetoric was essential to the discovery of truths, because it provided the means of ordering and clarifying arguments.

===Sophists===
{{Main|Sophist|l1=Sophists}}
In Europe, organized thought about public speaking began in [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Kennedy, G.A. (1994). A New History of Classical Rhetoric. Princeton University Press. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly, the first study about the power of language may be attributed to the philosopher [[Empedocles]] (d. c. 444 BC), whose theories on human knowledge would provide a newfound basis for many future rhetoricians. The first written manual is attributed to [[Corax of Syracuse|Corax]] and his pupil [[Tisias]]. Their work, as well as that of many of the early rhetoricians, grew out of the courts of law; Tisias, for example, is believed to have written judicial speeches that others delivered in the courts. Teaching in oratory was popularized in the 5th century BC by itinerant teachers known as [[sophist]]s, the best known of whom were [[Protagoras]] (c. 481–420 BC), [[Gorgias]] (c. 483–376 BC), and [[Isocrates]] (436–338 BC). Aspasia of Miletus&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Aspasia|date=2018-10-15|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aspasia&amp;oldid=864170801|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; is believed to be one of the first women to engage in private and public rhetoric activities as a Sophist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rhetorical tradition: readings from classical times to the present|date=1990|publisher=Bedford Books of St. Martin's Press|editor1-last=Bizzell|editor1-first=Patricia|editor2-last=Herzberg|editor2-first=Bruce|isbn=031200348X|location=Boston|oclc=21325600}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sophists were a disparate group who travelled from city to city, teaching in public places to attract students and offer them an education. Their central focus was on [[logos]] or what we might broadly refer to as discourse, its functions and powers. They defined parts of speech, analyzed poetry, parsed close synonyms, invented argumentation strategies, and debated the nature of reality. They claimed to make their students "better", or, in other words, to teach virtue. They thus claimed that human "excellence" was not an accident of fate or a prerogative of noble birth, but an art or "''techne''" that could be taught and learned. They were thus among the first humanists. Several sophists also questioned received wisdom about the gods and the Greek culture, which they believed was taken for granted by Greeks of their time, making them among the first agnostics. For example, they argued that cultural practices were a function of convention or ''[[Law|nomos]]'' rather than blood or birth or ''phusis''. They argued even further that morality or immorality of any action could not be judged outside of the cultural context within which it occurred. The well-known phrase, "Man is the measure of all things" arises from this belief. One of their most famous, and infamous, doctrines has to do with probability and counter arguments. They taught that every argument could be countered with an opposing argument, that an argument's effectiveness derived from how "likely" it appeared to the audience (its probability of seeming true), and that any probability argument could be countered with an inverted probability argument. Thus, if it seemed likely that a strong, poor man were guilty of robbing a rich, weak man, the strong poor man could argue, on the contrary, that this very likelihood (that he would be a suspect) makes it unlikely that he committed the crime, since he would most likely be apprehended for the crime. They also taught and were known for their ability to make the weaker (or worse) argument the stronger (or better).  [[Aristophanes]] famously parodies the clever inversions that sophists were known for in his play ''The Clouds''.

The word "sophistry" developed strong negative connotations in ancient Greece that continue today, but in ancient Greece sophists were nevertheless popular and well-paid professionals, widely respected for their abilities but also widely criticized for their excesses.

===Isocrates===
{{Main|Isocrates }}
Isocrates (436–338 BC), like the sophists, taught public speaking as a means of human improvement, but he worked to distinguish himself from the Sophists, whom he saw as claiming far more than they could deliver. He suggested that while an art of virtue or excellence did exist, it was only one piece, and the least, in a process of self-improvement that relied much more heavily on native talent and desire, constant practice, and the imitation of good models. Isocrates believed that practice in speaking publicly about noble themes and important questions would function to improve the character of both speaker and audience while also offering the best service to a city. In fact, Isocrates was an outspoken champion of rhetoric as a mode of civic engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates. "Against the Sophists." In ''Isocrates with an English Translation in three volumes'', by George Norlin, PhD, LL.D. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1980.; Isocrates. "Antidosis." In ''Isocrates with an English Translation in three volumes'', by George Norlin, PhD, LL.D. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; He thus wrote his speeches as "models" for his students to imitate in the same way that poets might imitate Homer or Hesiod, seeking to inspire in them a desire to attain fame through civic leadership. His was the first permanent school in [[Athens]] and it is likely that [[Plato's Academy]] and [[Aristotle's Lyceum]] were founded in part as a response to Isocrates. Though he left no handbooks, his speeches (''"Antidosis"'' and ''"Against the Sophists"'' are most relevant to students of rhetoric) became models of oratory (he was one of the canonical "[[Ten Attic Orators]]") and keys to his entire educational program. He had a marked influence on [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]], and through them, on the entire educational system of the west.

===Plato===
{{Main|Plato|Platonism}}
[[Plato]] (427–347 BC) famously outlined the differences between true and false rhetoric in a number of dialogues; particularly the ''Gorgias'' and ''Phaedrus'' dialogues wherein Plato disputes the sophistic notion that the art of persuasion (the sophists' art, which he calls "rhetoric"), can exist independent of the art of dialectic. Plato claims that since sophists appeal only to what seems probable, they are not advancing their students and audiences, but simply flattering them with what they want to hear. While Plato's condemnation of rhetoric is clear in the ''Gorgias'', in the ''Phaedrus'' he suggests the possibility of a true art wherein rhetoric is based upon the knowledge produced by dialectic, and relies on a dialectically informed rhetoric to appeal to the main character, Phaedrus, to take up philosophy. Thus Plato's rhetoric is actually dialectic (or philosophy) "turned" toward those who are not yet philosophers and are thus unready to pursue dialectic directly.  Plato's animosity against rhetoric, and against the sophists, derives not only from their inflated claims to teach virtue and their reliance on appearances, but from the fact that his teacher, Socrates, was sentenced to death after sophists' efforts.

===Aristotle===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2013}}
{{Main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)}}
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A marble bust of Aristotle]]
[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) was a student of Plato who famously set forth an extended treatise on rhetoric that still repays careful study today. In the first sentence of [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|The Art of Rhetoric]], Aristotle says that "rhetoric is the counterpart [literally, the [[antistrophe]]] of dialectic".&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle's Rhetoric'' Book I Chapter 1 [1354a] {{cite web |url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008201141/http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-1.html |archivedate=8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the "antistrophe" of a Greek [[ode]] responds to and is patterned after the structure of the "[[strophe]]" (they form two sections of the whole and are sung by two parts of the chorus), so the art of rhetoric follows and is structurally patterned after the art of dialectic because both are arts of discourse production. Thus, while dialectical methods are necessary to find truth in theoretical matters, rhetorical methods are required in practical matters such as adjudicating somebody's guilt or innocence when charged in a court of law, or adjudicating a prudent course of action to be taken in a deliberative assembly. The core features of dialectic include the absence of determined subject matter, its elaboration on earlier empirical practice, the explication of its aims, the type of utility and the definition of the proper function.

For Plato and Aristotle, dialectic involves persuasion, so when Aristotle says that rhetoric is the antistrophe of dialectic, he means that rhetoric as he uses the term has a domain or scope of application that is parallel to, but different from, the domain or scope of application of dialectic. In ''Nietzsche Humanist'' (1998: 129), Claude Pavur explains that "[t]he Greek prefix 'anti' does not merely designate opposition, but it can also mean 'in place of.'"  When Aristotle characterizes rhetoric as the antistrophe of dialectic, he no doubt means that rhetoric is used in place of dialectic when we are discussing civic issues in a court of law or in a legislative assembly. The domain of rhetoric is civic affairs and practical decision making in civic affairs, not theoretical considerations of operational definitions of terms and clarification of thought. These, for him, are in the domain of dialectic.

Aristotle's treatise on rhetoric systematically describes civic rhetoric as a human art or skill (techne). It is more of an objective theory than it is an interpretive theory with a rhetorical tradition. Aristotle's art of rhetoric emphasizes persuasion as the purpose of rhetoric. His definition of rhetoric as "the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion", essentially a mode of discovery, limits the art to the inventional process, and Aristotle heavily emphasizes the logical aspect of this process. In his account, rhetoric is the art of discovering all available means of persuasion. A speaker supports the probability of a message by logical, ethical, and emotional proofs. Some form of logos, ethos, and pathos is present in every possible public presentation that exists. But the treatise in fact also discusses not only elements of style and (briefly) delivery, but also emotional appeals (pathos) and characterological appeals (ethos).

Aristotle identifies three steps or "offices" of rhetoric—invention, arrangement, and style—and three different types of rhetorical proof: [[ethos]] (Aristotle's theory of character and how the character and credibility of a speaker can influence an audience to consider him/her to be believable—there being three qualities that contribute to a credible ethos: perceived intelligence, virtuous character, and goodwill);&lt;ref&gt;Note:This could be any position in which the speaker—whether an acknowledged expert on the subject, or an acquaintance of a person who experienced the matter in question—knows about the topic. For instance, when a magazine claims that ''An [[MIT]] professor predicts that the robotic era is coming in 2050,'' the use of big-name "MIT" (a world-renowned American university for the advanced research in mathematics, science, and technology) establishes the "strong" credibility.&lt;/ref&gt; [[pathos]] (the use of emotional appeals to alter the audience's judgment through metaphor, amplification, storytelling, or presenting the topic in a way that evokes strong emotions in the audience.); and, [[logos]] (the use of reasoning, either [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] or [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], to construct an argument).

Aristotle emphasized ''[[Deductive reasoning|enthymematic reasoning]]'' as central to the process of rhetorical invention, though later rhetorical theorists placed much less emphasis on it.  An "enthymeme" would follow today's form of a syllogism; however it would exclude either the major or minor premise. An enthymeme is persuasive because the audience is providing the missing premise.  Because the audience is able to provide the missing premise, they are more likely to be persuaded by the message.

Aristotle identified three different types or genres of civic rhetoric.  ''[[Forensic]]'' (also known as judicial), was concerned with determining the truth or falseness of events that took place in the past and issues of guilt.  An example of forensic rhetoric would be in a courtroom.  ''[[Deliberative]]'' (also known as political), was concerned with determining whether or not particular actions should or should not be taken in the future. Making laws would be an example of deliberative rhetoric.  ''[[Epideictic]]'' (also known as ceremonial), was concerned with praise and blame, values, right and wrong, demonstrating beauty and skill in the present.  Examples of epideictic rhetoric would include a eulogy or a wedding toast.

==Canons==
The Five Canons of Rhetoric serve as a guide to creating persuasive messages and arguments.  These are [[inventio]]n (the process of developing arguments); [[Dispositio|arrangement]] (organizing the arguments for extreme effect); [[Elocutio|style]] (determining how to present the arguments); [[Memoria|memory]] (the process of learning and memorizing the speech and persuasive messages), and [[Pronuntiatio|delivery]] (the gestures, pronunciation, tone and pace used when presenting the persuasive arguments).&lt;ref&gt;Note: Memory was added much later to the original four canons.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rhetoric field, there is an intellectual debate about Aristotle's definition of rhetoric. Some believe that Aristotle defines rhetoric in ''On Rhetoric'' as the art of persuasion, while others think he defines it as the art of judgment. Rhetoric as the art of judgment would mean the rhetor discerns the available means of persuasion with a choice. Aristotle also says rhetoric is concerned with judgment because the audience judges the rhetor's ethos.

One of the most famous of Aristotelian doctrines was the idea of topics (also referred to as [[The Common Topics|common topics]] or commonplaces). Though the term had a wide range of application (as a memory technique or compositional exercise, for example) it most often referred to the "seats of argument"—the list of categories of thought or modes of reasoning—that a speaker could use to generate arguments or proofs. The topics were thus a heuristic or inventional tool designed to help speakers categorize and thus better retain and apply frequently used types of argument. For example, since we often see effects as "like" their causes, one way to invent an argument (about a future effect) is by discussing the cause (which it will be "like"). This and other rhetorical topics derive from Aristotle's belief that there are certain predictable ways in which humans (particularly non-specialists) draw conclusions from premises. Based upon and adapted from his dialectical Topics, the rhetorical topics became a central feature of later rhetorical theorizing, most famously in Cicero's work of that name.

===Cicero===
{{Main|Cicero|Asiatic style|De Inventione|De Oratore|Brutus (Cicero)|De Optimo Genere Oratorum|De Partitionibus Oratoriae}}
[[File:Thorvaldsen Cicero.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bust of Marcus Tullius Cicero]]
For the Romans, oration became an important part of public life. [[Cicero]] (106–43 BC) was chief among Roman rhetoricians and remains the best known ancient orator and the only orator who both spoke in public and produced treatises on the subject. ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', formerly attributed to Cicero but now considered to be of unknown authorship, is one of the most significant works on rhetoric and is still widely used as a reference today. It is an extensive reference on the use of rhetoric, and in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], it achieved wide publication as an advanced school text on rhetoric.

Cicero is considered one of the most significant rhetoricians of all time, charting a middle path between the competing Attic and [[Asiatic style]]s to become considered second only to [[Demosthenes]] among history's orators.&lt;ref&gt;Gesine Manuwald, Cicero: Philippics 3–9, vol. 2, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2007, pp. 129ff&lt;/ref&gt; His works include the early and very influential [[De Inventione]] (On Invention, often read alongside the ''Ad Herennium'' as the two basic texts of rhetorical theory throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance), [[De Oratore]] (a fuller statement of rhetorical principles in dialogue form), [[Topics (Cicero)|Topics]] (a rhetorical treatment of common topics, highly influential through the Renaissance), [[Brutus (Cicero)]] (a discussion of famous orators) and [[Orator (Cicero)|Orator]] (a defense of Cicero's style). Cicero also left a large body of speeches and letters which would establish the outlines of Latin eloquence and style for generations to come. It was the rediscovery of Cicero's speeches (such as the defense of Archias) and letters (to Atticus) by Italians like [[Petrarch]] that, in part, ignited the cultural innovations that we know as the Renaissance.  He championed the learning of Greek (and Greek rhetoric), contributed to Roman ethics, linguistics, philosophy, and politics, and emphasized the importance of all forms of appeal (emotion, humor, stylistic range, irony and digression in addition to pure reasoning) in oratory. But perhaps his most significant contribution to subsequent rhetoric, and education in general, was his argument that orators learn not only about the specifics of their case (the ''hypothesis'') but also about the general questions from which they derived (the ''theses'').  Thus, in giving a speech in defense of a poet whose Roman citizenship had been questioned, the orator should examine not only the specifics of that poet's civic status, he should also examine the role and value of poetry and of literature more generally in Roman culture and political life.  The orator, said Cicero, needed to be knowledgeable about all areas of human life and culture, including law, politics, history, literature, ethics, warfare, medicine, even arithmetic and geometry. Cicero gave rise to the idea that the "ideal orator" be well-versed in all branches of learning: an idea that was rendered as "liberal humanism", and that lives on today in liberal arts or general education requirements in colleges and universities around the world.

===Quintilian===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
{{Main|Quintilian|Byzantine rhetoric}}
Quintilian (35–100 AD) began his career as a pleader in the courts of law; his reputation grew so great that [[Vespasian]] created a chair of rhetoric for him in Rome. The culmination of his life's work was the ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' (''Institutes of Oratory,'' or alternatively, ''The Orator's Education''), a lengthy treatise on the training of the orator, in which he discusses the training of the "perfect" orator from birth to old age and, in the process, reviews the doctrines and opinions of many influential rhetoricians who preceded him.

In the Institutes, Quintilian organizes rhetorical study through the stages of education that an aspiring orator would undergo, beginning with the selection of a nurse. Aspects of elementary education (training in reading and writing, grammar, and literary criticism) are followed by preliminary rhetorical exercises in composition (the [[progymnasmata]]) that include maxims and fables, narratives and comparisons, and finally full legal or political speeches. The delivery of speeches within the context of education or for entertainment purposes became widespread and popular under the term "declamation". Rhetorical training proper was categorized under five canons that would persist for centuries in academic circles:
* ''[[Inventio]]'' (invention) is the process that leads to the development and refinement of an argument.
* Once arguments are developed, ''[[dispositio]]'' (disposition, or arrangement) is used to determine how it should be organized for greatest effect, usually beginning with the ''[[exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''.
* Once the speech content is known and the structure is determined, the next steps involve ''[[elocutio]]'' (style) and ''[[pronuntiatio]]'' (presentation).
* ''[[Memoria]]'' (memory) comes to play as the speaker recalls each of these elements during the speech.
* ''[[Actio]]'' (delivery) is the final step as the speech is presented in a gracious and pleasing way to the audience&amp;nbsp;– the [[Grand Style]].

This work was available only in fragments in medieval times, but the discovery of a complete copy at the [[Abbey of St. Gall]] in 1416 led to its emergence as one of the most influential works on rhetoric during the Renaissance.

Quintilian's work describes not just the art of rhetoric, but the formation of the perfect orator as a politically active, virtuous, publicly minded citizen. His emphasis was on the ethical application of rhetorical training, in part a reaction against the growing tendency in Roman schools toward standardization of themes and techniques. At the same time that rhetoric was becoming divorced from political decision making, rhetoric rose as a culturally vibrant and important mode of entertainment and cultural criticism in a movement known as the "second sophistic", a development that gave rise to the charge (made by Quintilian and others) that teachers were emphasizing style over substance in rhetoric.

===Medieval to Enlightenment===
After the breakup of the western Roman Empire, the study of rhetoric continued to be central to the study of the verbal arts; but the study of the verbal arts went into decline for several centuries, followed eventually by a gradual rise in formal education, culminating in the rise of medieval universities. But rhetoric transmuted during this period into the arts of letter writing (''[[ars dictaminis]]'') and sermon writing (''ars praedicandi''). As part of the ''[[trivium (education)|trivium]]'', rhetoric was secondary to the study of logic, and its study was highly scholastic: students were given repetitive exercises in the creation of discourses on historical subjects (''suasoriae'') or on classic legal questions (''controversiae'').

Although he is not commonly regarded as a rhetorician, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (354–430) was trained in rhetoric and was at one time a professor of Latin rhetoric in Milan. After his conversion to Christianity, he became interested in using these "[[Paganism|pagan]]" arts for spreading his religion. This new use of rhetoric is explored in the Fourth Book of his ''De Doctrina Christiana'', which laid the foundation of what would become [[homiletics]], the rhetoric of the sermon. Augustine begins the book by asking why "the power of eloquence, which is so efficacious in pleading either for the erroneous cause or the right", should not be used for righteous purposes (IV. 3).

One early concern of the medieval Christian church was its attitude to classical rhetoric itself. [[Jerome]] (d. 420) complained, "What has [[Horace]] to do with the Psalms, [[Virgil]] with the Gospels, Cicero with the Apostles?" Augustine is also remembered for arguing for the preservation of pagan works and fostering a church tradition that led to conservation of numerous pre-Christian rhetorical writings.

Rhetoric would not regain its classical heights until the Renaissance, but new writings did advance rhetorical thought. [[Boethius]] (480?–524), in his brief ''Overview of the Structure of Rhetoric'', continues Aristotle's taxonomy by placing rhetoric in subordination to philosophical argument or dialectic.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Bizzell and Bruce Herzberg ''The Rhetorical Tradition: Readings from Classical Times to the Present'', Boston: Bedford / St. Martins, 2nd ed., 2001, p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|introduction of Arab scholarship]] from European relations with the [[Caliphate|Muslim empire]] (in particular [[Al-Andalus]]) renewed interest in Aristotle and Classical thought in general, leading to what some historians call the 12th century Renaissance. A number of medieval grammars and studies of poetry and rhetoric appeared.

Late medieval rhetorical writings include those of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225?–1274), [[Matthew of Vendome]] (''Ars Versificatoria'', 1175?), and [[Geoffrey of Vinsauf]] (''Poetria Nova'', 1200–1216). Pre-modern female rhetoricians, outside of Socrates' friend [[Aspasia]], are rare; but medieval rhetoric produced by women either in religious orders, such as [[Julian of Norwich]] (d. 1415), or the very well-connected [[Christine de Pizan]] (1364?–1430?), did occur if not always recorded in writing.

In his 1943 [[Cambridge University]] doctoral dissertation in English, Canadian [[Marshall McLuhan]] (1911–1980) surveys the verbal arts from approximately the time of [[Cicero]] down to the time of [[Thomas Nashe]] (1567–1600?).&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan's dissertation was scheduled to be published in a critical edition by Gingko Press in April 2006 with the title ''The Classical Trivium: The Place of Thomas Nashe in the Learning of His Time''.&lt;/ref&gt;  His dissertation is still noteworthy for undertaking to study the history of the verbal arts together as the trivium, even though the developments that he surveys have been studied in greater detail since he undertook his study. As noted below, McLuhan became one of the most widely publicized thinkers in the 20th century, so it is important to note his scholarly roots in the study of the history of rhetoric and dialectic.

Another interesting record of medieval rhetorical thought can be seen in the many [[medieval debate literature|animal debate poems]] popular in England and the continent during the Middle Ages, such as [[The Owl and the Nightingale]] (13th century) and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[Parliament of Fowls]] (1382?).

===Sixteenth century===
Walter J. Ong's article "Humanism" in the 1967 ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' surveys [[Renaissance humanism]], which defined itself broadly as disfavoring medieval scholastic logic and dialectic and as favoring instead the study of classical Latin style and grammar and philology and rhetoric. (Reprinted in Ong's ''Faith and Contexts'' (Scholars Press, 1999; 4: 69–91.))
[[File:Quentin Massys- Erasmus of Rotterdam.JPG|thumb|upright=0.85|Portrait of [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]]]
One influential figure in the rebirth of interest in classical rhetoric was [[Erasmus]] (c. 1466–1536). His 1512 work, ''De Duplici Copia Verborum et Rerum'' (also known as ''[[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style]]''), was widely published (it went through more than 150 editions throughout Europe) and became one of the basic school texts on the subject. Its treatment of rhetoric is less comprehensive than the classic works of antiquity, but provides a traditional treatment of ''res-verba'' (matter and form): its first book treats the subject of [[elocutio]], showing the student how to use [[figure of speech|schemes and tropes]]; the second book covers [[inventio]]. Much of the emphasis is on abundance of variation (''copia'' means "plenty" or "abundance", as in copious or cornucopia), so both books focus on ways to introduce the maximum amount of variety into discourse. For instance, in one section of the ''De Copia'', Erasmus presents two hundred variations of the sentence "{{lang|la|Semper, dum vivam, tui meminero.}}" Another of his works, the extremely popular [[The Praise of Folly]], also had considerable influence on the teaching of rhetoric in the later 16th century. Its orations in favour of qualities such as madness spawned a type of exercise popular in Elizabethan grammar schools, later called [[adoxography]], which required pupils to compose passages in praise of useless things.

[[Juan Luis Vives]] (1492–1540) also helped shape the study of rhetoric in England. A Spaniard, he was appointed in 1523 to the Lectureship of Rhetoric at Oxford by [[Cardinal Wolsey]], and was entrusted by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to be one of the tutors of Mary. Vives fell into disfavor when Henry VIII divorced [[Catherine of Aragon]] and left England in 1528. His best-known work was a book on education, ''De Disciplinis'', published in 1531, and his writings on rhetoric included ''Rhetoricae, sive De Ratione Dicendi, Libri Tres'' (1533), ''De Consultatione'' (1533), and a rhetoric on letter writing, ''De Conscribendis Epistolas'' (1536).

It is likely that many well-known English writers were exposed to the works of [[Erasmus]] and [[Juan Luis Vives|Vives]] (as well as those of the Classical rhetoricians) in their schooling, which was conducted in Latin (not English) and often included some study of Greek and placed considerable emphasis on rhetoric. See, for example, T.W. Baldwin's ''William Shakspere's Small Latine and Lesse Greeke'', 2 vols. (University of Illinois Press, 1944).

The mid-16th century saw the rise of vernacular rhetorics—those written in English rather than in the Classical languages; adoption of works in English was slow, however, due to the strong orientation toward Latin and Greek. [[Leonard Cox]]'s ''The Art or Crafte of Rhetoryke'' (c. 1524–1530; second edition published in 1532) is considered to be the earliest text on rhetorics in English; it was, for the most part, a translation of the work of [[Melanchthon|Philipp Melanchthon]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Ives Carpenter, "Leonard Cox and the First English Rhetoric," ''Modern Language Notes'', Vol. 13, No. 5 (May 1898), pp.&amp;nbsp;146–47. {{doi|10.2307/2917751}}. {{JSTOR|2917751}}&amp;nbsp;–  subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; A successful early text was [[Thomas Wilson (rhetorician)|Thomas Wilson]]'s ''The Arte of Rhetorique'' (1553), which presents a traditional treatment of rhetoric. For instance, Wilson presents the five canons of rhetoric (Invention, Disposition, [[Elocutio]], [[Memoria]], and Utterance or [[Actio]]). Other notable works included Angel Day's ''The English Secretorie'' (1586, 1592), [[George Puttenham]]'s ''The Arte of English Poesie'' (1589), and [[Richard Rainholde]]'s ''Foundacion of Rhetorike'' (1563).

During this same period, a movement began that would change the organization of the school curriculum in Protestant and especially Puritan circles and led to rhetoric losing its central place. A French scholar, Pierre de la Ramée, in Latin [[Petrus Ramus]] (1515–1572), dissatisfied with what he saw as the overly broad and redundant organization of the [[trivium (education)|trivium]], proposed a new curriculum. In his scheme of things, the five components of rhetoric no longer lived under the common heading of rhetoric. Instead, invention and disposition were determined to fall exclusively under the heading of dialectic, while style, delivery, and memory were all that remained for rhetoric. See [[Walter J. Ong]], ''Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue: From the Art of Discourse to the Art of Reason'' (Harvard University Press, 1958; reissued by the University of Chicago Press, 2004, with a new foreword by Adrian Johns). Ramus was martyred during the French Wars of Religion. His teachings, seen as inimical to Catholicism, were short-lived in France but found a fertile ground in the Netherlands, Germany and England.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Marc Fumaroli]], ''Age de l'Éloquence'', 1980, for an extensive presentation of the intricate political and religious debates concerning rhetoric in France and Italy at the time&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Ramus' French followers, [[Audomarus Talaeus]] (Omer Talon) published his rhetoric, ''Institutiones Oratoriae'', in 1544. This work provided a simple presentation of rhetoric that emphasized the treatment of style, and became so popular that it was mentioned in [[John Brinsley the elder|John Brinsley]]'s (1612) ''Ludus literarius; or The Grammar Schoole'' as being the "most used in the best schooles". Many other [[Ramist]] rhetorics followed in the next half-century, and by the 17th century, their approach became the primary method of teaching rhetoric in Protestant and especially Puritan circles.&lt;ref&gt;See Walter J. Ong, ''Ramus and Talon Inventory'' (Harvard University Press, 1958); Joseph S. Freedman, ''Philosophy and the Art Europe, 1500–1700: Teaching and Texts at Schools and Universities'' (Ashgate, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Milton]] (1608–1674) wrote a textbook in logic or dialectic in Latin based on Ramus' work.&lt;ref&gt;Which has now been translated into English by Walter J. Ong and Charles J. Ermatinger in ''The Complete Prose Works of John Milton'' (Yale University Press, 1982; 8: 206–407), with a lengthy introduction by Ong (pp. 144–205). The introduction is reprinted in Ong's ''Faith and Contexts'' (Scholars Press, 1999; 4: 111–141).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramism could not exert any influence on the established Catholic schools and universities, which remained loyal to Scholasticism, or on the new Catholic schools and universities founded by members of the religious orders known as the [[Society of Jesus]] or the Oratorians, as can be seen in the [[Jesuit]] curriculum (in use right up to the 19th century, across the Christian world) known as the [[Ratio Studiorum]] (that Claude Pavur, S.J., has recently translated into English, with the Latin text in the parallel column on each page (St. Louis: Institute of Jesuit Sources, 2005)). If the influence of Cicero and Quintilian permeates the [[Ratio Studiorum]], it is through the lenses of devotion and the militancy of the Counter-Reformation. The ''Ratio'' was indeed imbued with a sense of the divine, of the incarnate logos, that is of rhetoric as an eloquent and humane means to reach further devotion and further action in the Christian city, which was absent from Ramist formalism. The Ratio is, in rhetoric, the answer to St Ignatius Loyola's practice, in devotion, of "spiritual exercises". This complex oratorical-prayer system is absent from Ramism.

===Seventeenth century===
In New England and at [[Harvard College]] (founded 1636), Ramus and his followers dominated, as [[Perry Miller]] shows in ''The New England Mind: The Seventeenth Century'' (Harvard University Press, 1939). However, in England, several writers influenced the course of rhetoric during the 17th century, many of them carrying forward the dichotomy that had been set forth by Ramus and his followers during the preceding decades. Of greater importance is that this century saw the development of a modern, vernacular style that looked to English, rather than to Greek, Latin, or French models.

[[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626), although not a rhetorician, contributed to the field in his writings. One of the concerns of the age was to find a suitable style for the discussion of scientific topics, which needed above all a clear exposition of facts and arguments, rather than the ornate style favored at the time. Bacon in his ''The Advancement of Learning'' criticized those who are preoccupied with style rather than "the weight of matter, worth of subject, soundness of argument, life of invention, or depth of judgment". On matters of style, he proposed that the style conform to the subject matter and to the audience, that simple words be employed whenever possible, and that the style should be agreeable.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lisa Jardine]], ''Francis Bacon: Discovery and the Art of Discourse'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) also wrote on rhetoric. Along with a shortened translation of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Rhetoric'', Hobbes also produced a number of other works on the subject. Sharply contrarian on many subjects, Hobbes, like Bacon, also promoted a simpler and more natural style that used figures of speech sparingly.

Perhaps the most influential development in English style came out of the work of the [[Royal Society]] (founded in 1660), which in 1664 set up a committee to improve the English language. Among the committee's members were [[John Evelyn]] (1620–1706), [[Thomas Sprat]] (1635–1713), and [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700). Sprat regarded "fine speaking" as a disease, and thought that a proper style should "reject all amplifications, digressions, and swellings of style" and instead "return back to a primitive purity and shortness" (''History of the Royal Society'', 1667).

While the work of this committee never went beyond planning, John Dryden is often credited with creating and exemplifying a new and modern English style. His central tenet was that the style should be proper "to the occasion, the subject, and the persons". As such, he advocated the use of English words whenever possible instead of foreign ones, as well as vernacular, rather than Latinate, syntax. His own prose (and his poetry) became exemplars of this new style.

===Eighteenth century===
Arguably one of the most influential schools of rhetoric during this time was Scottish Belletristic rhetoric, exemplified by such professors of rhetoric as [[Hugh Blair]] whose [[Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres]] saw international success in various editions and translations.

==Modern==
At the turn of the 20th century, there was a revival of rhetorical study manifested in the establishment of departments of rhetoric and speech at academic institutions, as well as the formation of national and international professional organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Histories of the emergence of rhetorical studies in 20th-century America can be found in Cohen, H. (1994). ''The history of speech communication: The emergence of a discipline, 1914–1945''. Annandale, VA: Speech Communication Association; and Gehrke, P.J. (2009). ''The ethics and politics of speech: Communication and rhetoric in the twentieth century''. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jim A. Kuypers]] and Andrew King suggest that the early interest in rhetorical studies was a movement away from elocution as taught in departments of English in the United States, and was an attempt to refocus rhetorical studies away from delivery only to civic engagement. Collectively, they write, twentieth century rhetorical studies offered an understanding of rhetoric that demonstrated a "rich complexity" of how rhetorical scholars understood the nature of rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Jim A. Kuypers and Andrew King, ''Twentieth-Century Roots of Rhetorical Studies'' (Westpost, CT: Praeger, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists generally agree that by the 1930s a significant reason for the revival of the study of rhetoric was the renewed importance of language and persuasion in the increasingly mediated environment of the 20th century (see [[Linguistic turn]]) and through the 21st century, with the media focus on the wide variations and analyses of political rhetoric and its consequences. The rise of [[advertising]] and of [[mass media]] such as [[photography]], [[telegraphy]], [[radio]], and [[film]] brought rhetoric more prominently into people's lives. More recently the term rhetoric has been applied to media forms other than verbal language, e.g. [[Visual rhetoric]].

===Notable modern theorists===
* '''[[Chaïm Perelman]]''' was a philosopher of law, who studied, taught, and lived most of his life in Brussels. He was among the most important [[argumentation theory|argumentation]] theorists of the 20th century. His chief work is the ''Traité de l'argumentation&amp;nbsp;– la nouvelle rhétorique'' (1958), with [[Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca]], which was translated into English as ''The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation'', by John Wilkinson and Purcell Weaver (1969). Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca move rhetoric from the periphery to the center of argumentation theory. Among their most influential concepts are "dissociation", "the universal audience", "quasi-logical argument", and "presence".
* '''[[Kenneth Burke]]''' was a rhetorical theorist, philosopher, and poet. Many of his works are central to modern rhetorical theory: ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' (1950), ''A Grammar of Motives'' (1945), ''Language as Symbolic Action'' (1966), and ''Counterstatement'' (1931). Among his influential concepts are "identification", "consubstantiality", and the "dramatistic pentad". He described rhetoric as "the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Borchers | first1 = Timothy A. | title = Rhetorical theory: an introduction | year = 2006 | publisher = [[Thomson/Wadsworth]] | location = Belmont, CA| isbn = 0-534-63918-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to Aristotle's theory, Aristotle was more interested in constructing rhetoric, while Burke was interested in "debunking" it.
* '''[[Edwin Black (rhetorician)|Edwin Black]]''' was a rhetorical critic best known for his book ''Rhetorical Criticism: A Study in Method''&lt;ref&gt;Black, Edwin. (1965) ''Rhetorical Criticism a Study in Method.'' Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1965) in which he criticized the dominant "neo-Aristotelian" tradition in American [[rhetorical criticism]] as having little in common with Aristotle "besides some recurrent topics of discussion and a vaguely derivative view of rhetorical discourse". Furthermore, he contended, because rhetorical scholars had been focusing primarily on Aristotelian logical forms they often overlooked important, alternative types of discourse. He also published several highly influential essays including: "Secrecy and Disclosure as Rhetorical Forms",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Black, Edwin | year = 1988 | title = Secrecy and Disclosure as Rhetorical Forms | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Speech | volume = 74 | issue = 2| page = 133 | doi=10.1080/00335638809383833}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Second Persona",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Black, Edwin | year = 1970 | title = The Second Persona | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Speech | volume = 56 | issue = 2| page = 109 | doi=10.1080/00335637009382992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "A Note on Theory and Practice in Rhetorical Criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Black, Edwin | year = 1980 | title = A Note on Theory and Practice in Rhetorical Criticism | journal = Western Journal of Speech Communication: WJSC | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 331–36 | doi=10.1080/10570318009374018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Marshall McLuhan]]''' was a media theorist whose theories and whose choice of objects of study are important to the study of rhetoric. McLuhan's famous dictum "the medium is the message" highlights the significance of the medium itself. No other scholar of the history and theory of rhetoric was as widely publicized in the 20th century as McLuhan.&lt;ref&gt;When McLuhan was working on his 1943 Cambridge University doctoral dissertation on the verbal arts and Nashe, he was also preparing the materials for his book ''The Mechanical Bride: The Folklore of Industrial Man'' (Vanguard Press, 1951). This was a compilation of exhibits of ads and other materials from popular culture with short essays involving rhetorical analyses of the ways in which the material in an item aims to persuade and comment on the persuasive strategies in each item.  McLuhan later shifted the focus of his rhetorical analysis and began to consider how communication media themselves affect us as persuasive devices.  McLuhan expresses this insight when he says "[[The medium is the message]]". This shift in focus from his 1951 book led to his two most widely known books, ''The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man'' (University of Toronto Press, 1962) and ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man'' (McGraw-Hill, 1964)'; these books represent an inward turn to attending to one's consciousness in contrast to the more outward orientation of other rhetoricians toward sociological considerations and symbolic interaction.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[I. A. Richards]]''' was a literary critic and rhetorician. His ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'' is an important text in modern rhetorical theory. In this work, he defined rhetoric as "a study of misunderstandings and its remedies",&lt;ref&gt;Richards, I. A. (1965) ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'' New York: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced the influential concepts ''tenor'' and ''vehicle'' to describe the components of a metaphor—the main idea and the concept to which it is compared.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, I. A. (1965) ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'' New York: Oxford. p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The [[Groupe µ]]'''. This interdisciplinary team has contributed to the renovation of the elocutio in the context of poetics and modern linguistics, significantly with ''Rhétorique générale'' (1970; translated into English as ''A General Rhetoric'', by Paul B. Burrell et Edgar M. Slotkin, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1981) and ''Rhétorique de la poésie'' (1977).
* '''[[Stephen Toulmin]]''' was a philosopher whose models of argumentation have had great influence on modern rhetorical theory. His ''Uses of Argument'' is an important text in modern rhetorical theory and [[argumentation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Stephen| last=Toulmin| authorlink= Stephen Toulmin| year=2003| title= The Uses of Argument |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-521-53483-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Richard Vatz]]''' is a rhetorician responsible for the salience-agenda/meaning-spin conceptualization of rhetoric, later revised (2014) to an "agenda-spin" model, a conceptualization which emphasizes persuader responsibility for the agenda and spin he/she creates.  His theory is notable for its agent-focused perspective, articulated in ''The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion'' (Kendall Hunt), derived from the Summer, 1973 ''Philosophy and Rhetoric'' article, "The Myth of the Rhetorical Situation".
* '''[[Richard M. Weaver]]''' was a rhetorical and cultural critic well known for his contributions to the new conservatism. He focused on the ethical implications of rhetoric and his ideas can be seen in "Language is Sermonic" and "The Ethics of Rhetoric". According to Weaver there are four types of argument, and through the argument a person habitually uses the critic can see the rhetorician's worldview. Those who prefer the argument from genus or definition are idealists. Those who argue from similitude see the connectedness between things and are used by poets and religious individuals. The argument from consequence sees a cause and effect relationship. Finally the argument from circumstance considers the particulars of a situation and is an argument preferred by liberals.
* [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldua]] was a "Mestiza" and "Borderland" rhetorician, as well as a Mexican-American poet and pioneer in the field of Chicana lesbian feminism. Mestiza and Borderland rhetoric focused on ones' formation of identity, disregarding societal and discourse labels.&lt;ref name="Lunsford 1998 1–27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunsford|first=Andrea A.|date=1998|title=Toward a Mestiza rhetoric: Gloria Anzaldua on composition and postcoloniality|jstor=20866168|journal=JAC|volume=18|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; With "Mestiza" rhetoric, one viewed the world as discovering one's "self" in others and others' "self" in you. Through this process, one accepted living in a world of contradictions and ambiguity.&lt;ref name="Lunsford 1998 1–27"/&gt; Anzaldua learned to balance cultures, being Mexican in the eyes of the Anglo-majority and Indian in a Mexican culture.&lt;ref name="Lunsford 1998 1–27"/&gt; Her other notable works include: Sinister Wisdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The rhetorical tradition: Readings from classical times to the present|last=Bizzell|first=Patricia|last2=Herzberg|first2=Bruce|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2000|isbn=978-0-312-14839-3|location=Boston, MA|pages=1585–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borderlands/La Fronters: The New Mestiza,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The rhetorical tradition: Readings from classical times to the present|last=Bizzell|first=Patricia|last2=Herzberg|first2=Bruce|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2000|isbn=978-0-312-14839-3|location=Boston, MA|pages=1584–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; and La Prieta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Radical rhetoric: Excavating Gloria Anzaldua's "La Prieta"|last=Camp|first=Jessica Rae|publisher=Dissertation|year=2010|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/857938624|location=Ann Harbor, MI|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Gertrude Buck]]''' was one of the prominent female rhetorical theorists who was also a composition educator. Her scholastic contributions such as "The present status of Rhetorical Theory"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Getrude|first=Buck|date=1900|title=The Present Status of Rhetorical Theory|jstor=2917917|journal=Modern Language Notes|volume=15|pages=84–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; to inspire the egalitarian status of hearers-speakers to achieve the goal of communication. Another piece that she edited with Newton Scott is "Brief English Grammar" which troubled the common prescriptive grammar. This book received a lot of praise and critiques for descriptive nature of social responsibility from non-mainstream beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toward a feminist rhetoric: The writing of Gertrude Buck|last=Campbell|first=Joann|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1996|location=Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Krista Ratcliffe''' is one of the prominent female rhetorical theorists. She wrote one of her influential models of ''"Rhetorical Listening: Identification, Gender, Whiteness."'' In it, she theorizes many ways in which effect has to navigate the pitfalls of biases, ideological and cultural conditioning, and appropriation. She points out and  recommends relentless engagement. In her Book,  Ratcliffe seems to recommend&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cla.purdue.edu/facultystaff/profiles/new/newfaculty-15/Ratcliffe._Krista.html|title=Krista Ratcliffe}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she said that I would suggest that teachers should keep themselves open to hearing diverse layers in their students' texts that both challenge their biases and point to new textual possibilities.

===Methods of analysis===

====Criticism seen as a method====
Rhetoric can be analyzed by a variety of methods and theories.  One such method is criticism.  When those using criticism analyze instances of rhetoric what they do is called rhetorical criticism (see section below). According to rhetorical critic [[Jim A. Kuypers]], "The use of rhetoric is an art; as such, it does not lend itself well to scientific methods of analysis.  Criticism is an art as well; as such, it is particularly well suited for examining rhetorical creations."&lt;ref name="Jim A 2009"&gt;[[Jim A. Kuypers]], "Rhetorical Criticism as Art," in Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action, Jim A. Kuypers, ed. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that criticism is a method of generating knowledge just as the scientific method is a method for generating knowledge: "The way the Sciences and the Humanities study the phenomena that surround us differ greatly in the amount of researcher personality allowed to influence the results of the study.  For example, in the Sciences researchers purposefully adhere to a strict method (the scientific method).  All scientific researchers are to use this same basic method, and successful experiments must be 100 percent replicable by others.  The application of the scientific method may take numerous forms, but the overall method remains the same—and the personality of the researcher is excised from the actual study. In sharp contrast, criticism (one of many Humanistic methods of generating knowledge) actively involves the personality of the researcher.  The very choices of what to study, and how and why to study a rhetorical artifact are heavily influenced by the personal qualities of the researcher. In criticism this is especially important since the personality of the critic considered an integral component of the study.  Further personalizing criticism, we find that rhetorical critics use a variety of means when examining a particular rhetorical artifact, with some critics even developing their own unique perspective to better examine a rhetorical artifact."&lt;ref name="Jim A 2009"/&gt;

[[Edwin Black (rhetorician)]] wrote on this point that, "Methods, then, admit of varying degrees of personality.  And criticism, on the whole, is near the indeterminate, contingent, personal end of the methodological scale.  In consequence of this placement, it is neither possible nor desirable for criticism to be fixed into a system, for critical techniques to be objectified, for critics to be interchangeable for purposes of [scientific] replication, or for rhetorical criticism to serve as the handmaiden of quasi-scientific theory.  [The] idea is that critical method is too personally expressive to be systematized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Black (rhetorician)|Edwin Black]], Rhetorical Criticism: A Study in Method (Madison, Wi: University of Wisconsin Press, 1978), x–xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim A. Kuypers sums this idea of criticism as art in the following manner: "In short, criticism is an art, not a science.  It is not a scientific method; it uses subjective methods of argument; it exists on its own, not in conjunction with other methods of generating knowledge (i.e., social scientific or scientific).  [I]nsight and imagination top statistical applications when studying rhetorical action."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim A. Kuypers]], "Rhetorical Criticism as Art," in ''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action'', Jim A. Kuypers, ed. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2009).  See also, Jim A. Kuypers, "Artistry, Purpose, and Academic Constraints in Rhetorical Criticism," in ''Purpose, Practice, and Pedagogy in Rhetorical Criticism'', Jim A. Kuypers, ed. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Observation on analytic method====
There does not exist an analytic method that is widely recognized as "the" rhetorical method, partly because many in rhetorical study see rhetoric as merely produced by reality (see dissent from that view below).   It is important to note that the object of rhetorical analysis is typically discourse, and therefore the principles of "rhetorical analysis" would be difficult to distinguish from those of "[[discourse analysis]]".  However, rhetorical analytic methods can also be applied to almost anything, including objects—a car, a castle, a computer, a comportment.

Generally speaking, rhetorical analysis makes use of rhetorical concepts (ethos, logos, kairos, mediation, etc.) to describe the social or epistemological functions of the object of study.  When the object of study happens to be some type of discourse (a speech, a poem, a joke, a newspaper article), the aim of rhetorical analysis is not simply to describe the claims and arguments advanced within the discourse, but (more important) to identify the specific semiotic strategies employed by the speaker to accomplish specific persuasive goals.  Therefore, after a rhetorical analyst discovers a use of language that is particularly important in achieving persuasion, she typically moves onto the question of "How does it work?"  That is, what effects does this particular use of rhetoric have on an audience, and how does that effect provide more clues as to the speaker's (or writer's) objectives?

There are some scholars who do partial rhetorical analysis and defer judgments about rhetorical success.  In other words, some analysts attempt to avoid the question of "Was this use of rhetoric successful [in accomplishing the aims of the speaker]?"  To others, however, that is the preeminent point: is the rhetoric strategically effective and what did the rhetoric accomplish?  This question allows a shift in focus from the speaker's objectives to the effects and functions of the rhetoric itself.

===Strategies=== &lt;!-- Anchor from redirect; caution. --&gt;
''Rhetorical strategies'' are the efforts made by authors to persuade or inform their readers.  Rhetorical strategies are employed by writers and refer to the different ways they can persuade the reader.  According to Gray, there are various argument strategies used in writing.  He describes four of these as argument from analogy, argument from absurdity, thought experiments, and inference to the best explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Gray| first=J. W.| title=Four Argument Strategies| url=http://ethicalrealism.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/four-argument-strategies/| accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Modern [[rhetorical criticism]] explores the relationship between text and context; that is, how an instance of rhetoric relates to circumstances. Since the aim of rhetoric is to be persuasive, the level to which the rhetoric in question persuades its audience is what must be analyzed, and later criticized. In determining the extent to which a text is persuasive, one may explore the text's relationship with its audience, purpose, ethics, argument, evidence, arrangement, delivery, and style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Speaking/Writing Connection|last=Ryan|first=David|publisher=Parthenon West Books|year=2007|isbn=978-0-9765684-9-0|location=Berkeley, CA|page=236|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Rhetorical Criticism: A Study in Method'', scholar [[Edwin Black]] states, "It is the task of criticism not to measure&amp;nbsp;... discourses dogmatically against some parochial standard of rationality but, allowing for the immeasurable wide range of human experience, to see them as they really are."&lt;ref&gt;Black, Edwin. ''Rhetorical Criticism: A Study in Method''. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1978), 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the language "as they really are" is debatable, rhetorical critics explain texts and speeches by investigating their [[rhetorical situation]], typically placing them in a framework of speaker/audience exchange.  The antithetical view places the rhetor at the center of creating that which is considered the extant situation; i.e., the agenda and spin.&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, Lloyd F. "The Rhetorical Situation." ''Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric'', Winter (1968). 1–14. {{JSTOR|40236733}}. cf. Vatz, Richard E. "The Myth of the Rhetorical Situation." ''Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric'', Summer (1974) {{JSTOR|40236848}} and ''The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion'', (Kendall Hunt, 2012, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional theoretical approaches====

Following the [[neo-Aristotelian]] approaches to criticism, scholars began to derive methods from other disciplines, such as history, philosophy, and the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Jansinski, James. "[http://blog.umd.edu/tpg/files/2012/08/Jasinski-WJC1.pdf The Status of Theory and Method in Rhetorical Criticism]." ''Western Journal of Communication'' 65, No. 3 (Summer 2001): 249. {{doi|10.1080/1057031010937470}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of critics' personal judgment decreased in explicit coverage while the analytical dimension of criticism began to gain momentum. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, methodological pluralism replaced the singular neo-Aristotelian method.  Methodological rhetorical criticism is typically done by deduction, where a broad method is used to examine a specific case of rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja. 1989. ''Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice''. Prospect Heights: Waveland Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  These types include:
* '''[[Ideological criticism]]'''&amp;nbsp;– critics engage rhetoric as it suggests the beliefs, values, assumptions, and interpretations held by the rhetor or the larger culture.  Ideological criticism also treats ideology as an artifact of discourse, one that is embedded in key terms (called "[[ideographs]]") as well as material resources and discursive embodiment.
* '''[[Cluster criticism]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a method developed by [[Kenneth Burke]] that seeks to help the critic understand the rhetor's worldview.  This means identifying terms that are 'clustered' around key symbols in the rhetorical artifact and the patterns in which they appear.
* '''[[Frame analysis]]'''&amp;nbsp;– when used as rhetorical criticism, this theoretical perspective allows critics to look for how rhetors construct an interpretive lens in their discourse. In short, how they make certain facts more noticeable than others.  It is particularly useful for analyzing products of the news media.
* '''[[Genre criticism|Generic criticism]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a method that assumes certain situations call for similar needs and expectations within the audience, therefore calling for certain types of rhetoric. It studies rhetoric in different times and locations, looking at similarities in the rhetorical situation and the rhetoric that responds to them.  Examples include eulogies, inaugural addresses, and declarations of war.
* '''[[Narrative criticism]]'''&amp;nbsp;– narratives help organize experiences in order to endow meaning to historical events and transformations.  Narrative criticism focuses on the story itself and how the construction of the narrative directs the interpretation of the situation.

By the mid-1980s, however, the study of rhetorical criticism began to move away from precise methodology towards conceptual issues. Conceptually driven criticism&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Houston Grey, "Conceptually-Oriented Criticism," in ''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action'', [[Jim A. Kuypers]], ed. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  operates more through abduction, according to scholar [[James Jasinski]], who argues that this emerging type of criticism can be thought of as a back-and-forth between the text and the concepts, which are being explored at the same time.  The concepts remain "works in progress", and understanding those terms develops through the analysis of a text.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, "Status," 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism is considered rhetorical when it focuses on the way some types of discourse react to situational exigencies—problems or demands—and constraints.  This means that modern rhetorical criticism is based in how the rhetorical case or object persuades, defines, or constructs the audience.  In modern terms, what can be considered rhetoric includes, but it is not limited to, speeches, scientific discourse, pamphlets, literary work, works of art, and pictures. Contemporary rhetorical criticism has maintained aspects of early neo-Aristotelian thinking through close reading, which attempts to explore the organization and stylistic structure of a rhetorical object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Leff Michael | year = 2001 | title = Lincoln at Cooper Union: Neo-Classical Criticism Revisited | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 65 | issue = 3| pages = 232–48 | doi=10.1080/10570310109374704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using close textual analysis means rhetorical critics use the tools of classical rhetoric and literary analysis to evaluate the style and strategy used to communicate the argument.

====Purpose of criticism====

Rhetorical criticism serves several purposes or functions.  First, rhetorical criticism hopes to help form or improve public taste.  It helps educate audiences and develops them into better judges of rhetorical situations by reinforcing ideas of value, morality, and suitability.  Rhetorical criticism can thus contribute to the audience's understanding of themselves and society.

According to [[Jim A. Kuypers]], a dual purpose for performing criticism should be primarily to enhance our appreciation and understanding. "[W]e wish to enhance both our own and others' understanding of the rhetorical act; we wish to share our insights with others, and to enhance their appreciation of the rhetorical act.  These are not hollow goals, but quality of life issues.  By improving understanding and appreciation, the critic can offer new and potentially exciting ways for others to see the world. Through understanding we also produce knowledge about human communication; in theory this should help us to better govern our interactions with others." Criticism is a humanizing activity in that it explores and highlights qualities that make us human."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim A. Kuypers]], "Artistry, Purpose, and Academic Constraints in Rhetorical Criticism," in Purpose, Practice, and Pedagogy in Rhetorical Criticism, Jim A. Kuypers, ed. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==French==
Rhetoric was part of the curriculum in [[Jesuit]] and, to a lesser extent, Oratorian colleges until the [[French Revolution]]. For Jesuits, right from the foundation of the Society in France, rhetoric was an integral part of the training of young men toward taking up leadership positions in the Church and in State institutions, as [[Marc Fumaroli]] has shown it in his foundational ''Âge de l'éloquence'' (1980). The Oratorians, by contrast, reserved it a lesser place, in part due to the stress they placed on modern language acquisition and a more sensualist philosophy (like [[Bernard Lamy]]'s ''La Rhétorique ou l'Art de parler'' (1675), which is an excellent example of their approach). Nonetheless, in the 18th Century, rhetoric was the structure and crown of secondary education, with works such as Rollin's ''Treatise of Studies'' achieving a wide and enduring fame across the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas M. Conley, ''Rhetoric in the European Tradition'', University of Chicago Press, 1990 for insights on French pre-1789 rhetoricians; for a fuller historical review with excerpts, Philippe-Joseph Salazar, ''L'art de parler'', Paris, Klincksieck, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, with [[Nicolas Boileau]] and [[François de Malherbe]], rhetoric is the instrument of the clarity of the comment and speech ; the literature that ensues from it is named "Sublime". The main representative remains [[Antoine de Rivarol|Rivarol]].

The French Revolution, however, turned this around. Philosophers such as [[Condorcet]], who drafted the French revolutionary chart for a people's education under the rule of reason, dismissed rhetoric as an instrument of oppression in the hands of clerics in particular. The Revolution went as far as to suppress the Bar, arguing that forensic rhetoric did disservice to a rational system of justice, by allowing [[Fallacy|fallacies]] and emotions to come into play. Nonetheless, as later historians of the 19th century were keen to explain, the Revolution was a high moment of eloquence and rhetorical prowess, although set against a background of rejecting rhetoric.

Under the First Empire and its wide-ranging educational reforms, imposed on or imitated across the Continent, rhetoric regained little ground. In fact, instructions to the newly founded Polytechnic School, tasked with training the scientific and technical elites, made it clear that written reporting was to supersede oral reporting. Rhetoric reentered secondary curriculum in fits and starts, but never regained the prominence it had enjoyed under the ''ancien régime'', although the penultimate year of secondary education was known as the Class of Rhetoric. When manuals were redrafted in the mid-century, in particular after the 1848 Revolution to formulate a national curriculum, care was taken to distance their approach to rhetoric from that of the Church, which was seen as an agent of conservatism and reactionary politics.

By the end of the 1870s, a major change had taken place: philosophy of the rationalist or eclectic kind, generally Kantian, had taken over rhetoric as the true end stage of secondary education (the so-called Class of Philosophy bridged secondary and university education). Rhetoric was then relegated to the study of literary figures of speech, a discipline later on taught as Stylistics within the French literature curriculum. More decisively, in 1890, a new standard written exercise superseded the rhetorical exercises of speech writing, letter writing and narration. The new genre, called dissertation, had been invented in 1866, for the purpose of rational argument in the philosophy class. Typically, in a dissertation, a question is asked, such as: "Is history a sign of humanity's freedom?" The structure of a dissertation consists in an introduction that elucidates the basic definitions involved in the question as set, followed by an argument or thesis, a counter-argument or antithesis, and a resolving argument or synthesis that is not a compromise between the former but the production of a new argument, ending with a conclusion that does not sum up the points but opens onto a new problem. Hegelianism influenced the dissertation design. It remains today the standard of writing in French humanities.

By the beginning of the 20th century, rhetoric was fast losing the remains of its former importance, and eventually was taken out of the school curriculum altogether at the time of the Separation of State and Churches (1905). Part of the argument was that rhetoric remained the last element of irrationality, driven by religious arguments, in what was perceived as inimical to Republican education. The move, initiated in 1789, found its resolution in 1902 when rhetoric was expunged from all curricula. At the same time, Aristotelian rhetoric, owing to a revival of Thomistic philosophy initiated by Rome, regained ground in what was left of Catholic education in France, in particular at the prestigious Faculty of Theology of Paris, now a private entity. Yet, rhetoric vanished substantially from the French scene, educational or intellectual, for some 60 years..

In the early 1960s a change began to take place, as the word rhetoric and the body of knowledge it covers began to be used again, in a modest and almost secret manner. The new linguistic turn, through the rise of [[semiotics]] as well as of structural [[linguistics]], brought to the fore a new interest in figures of speech as signs, the metaphor in particular (in the works of [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Groupe µ]], Michel Charles, Gérard Genette) while famed Structuralist [[Roland Barthes]], a classicist by training, perceived how some basic elements of rhetoric could be of use in the study of narratives, fashion and ideology. Knowledge of rhetoric was so dim in the early 1970s that his short memoir on rhetoric was seen as highly innovative. Basic as it was, it did help rhetoric regain some currency in avant-garde circles. [[Psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]], his contemporary, makes references to rhetoric, in particular to the Pre-Socratics. Philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] wrote on Voice.

At the same time, more profound work was taking place that eventually gave rise to the French school of rhetoric as it exists today.&lt;ref&gt;See also article on [[:fr:Rhétorique|Rhétorique]] in the French Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

This rhetorical revival took place on two fronts.&lt;ref&gt;See Philippe-Joseph Salazar's overview, "Rhetoric Achieves Nature. A View from Old Europe",'' Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric'' 40(1), 2007, 71–88&lt;/ref&gt; First, in 17th-century French studies, the mainstay of French literary education, awareness grew that rhetoric was necessary to push the limits of knowledge further, and also to provide an antidote to [[Structuralism]] and its denial of historicism in culture. This was the pioneering work of Marc Fumaroli who, building on the work of classicist and Neo-Latinist Alain Michel and French scholars such as Roger Zuber, published his famed ''Age de l'Eloquence'' (1980), was one of the founders of the International Society for the History of Rhetoric and was eventually elevated to a chair in rhetoric at the prestigious College de France. He is the editor in chief of a monumental ''History of Rhetoric in Modern Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;''Histoire de la rhétorique dans l'Europe moderne 1450–1950'', [[Marc Fumaroli]] ed., Paris, [[Presses Universitaires de France]], 1999. {{ISBN|2-13-049526-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His disciples form the second generation,&lt;ref&gt;Refer to " De l'éloquence à la rhétoricité, trente années fastes ", ''Dix-Septième Siècle'' 236, LIX (3), 2007, 421–26 {{ISBN|978-2-13-056096-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; with rhetoricians such as Françoise Waquet and Delphine Denis, both of the Sorbonne, or [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]] ([[:fr:Philippe-Joseph Salazar]] on the French Wikipedia), until recently at Derrida's College international de philosophie, laureate of the [[Harry Oppenheimer]] prize and whose recent book on  ''Hyperpolitique'' has attracted the French media's attention on a "re-appropriation of the means of production of persuasion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idee-jour.fr/Apprendre-la-rhetorique-un-art.html idee-jour.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511232741/http://www.idee-jour.fr/Apprendre-la-rhetorique-un-art.html |date=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, in the area of Classical studies, in the wake of Alain Michel, Latin scholars fostered a renewal in Cicero studies. They broke away from a pure literary reading of his orations, in an attempt to embed Cicero in European ethics. Meanwhile, among Greek scholars, the literary historian and philologist [[Jacques Bompaire]], the philologist and philosopher E. Dupréel, and later the literature historian [[Jacqueline de Romilly]] pioneered new studies in the Sophists and the Second Sophistic. The second generation of Classicists, often trained in philosophy as well (following [[Heidegger]] and Derrida, mainly), built on their work, with authors such as [[Marcel Detienne]] (now at Johns Hopkins), Nicole Loraux, Medievalist and logician [[:fr:Alain de Libera|Alain De Libera]] (Geneva),&lt;ref&gt;''L'art des Généralités'', Paris, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Ciceronian scholar Carlos Lévy (Sorbonne, Paris) and [[Barbara Cassin]] (Collége international de philosophie, Paris).&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Cassin,''L'effet sophistique'', Paris, Gallimard, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist of science [[Bruno Latour]] and economist Romain Laufer may also be considered part of, or close to this group. Also French philosophers specialized in Arabic commentaries on Aristotle's ''Rhetoric''.&lt;ref&gt;Maroun Aouad, ''Le Livre De la Rhétorique d'Ibn Tumlus''. Paris: Vrin. 2006. ''Le Commentaire Moyen d'[[Averroes]] à la Rhétorique d'Aristote''. Paris: Vrin. 3 Vol. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Links between the two strands—literary and philosophical—of the French school of rhetoric are strong and collaborative, and bear witness to the revival of rhetoric in France.&lt;ref&gt;Alongside the French school, the work of Belgians [[Chaim Perelman]] and his disciple Michel Meyer is noteworthy, although Perelman's foundational work remained generally unknown in France until the 1990s.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent issue of ''Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric'' presents current writing in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_rhetoric/toc/par.42.4.html|title=Project MUSE&amp;nbsp;– Philosophy and Rhetoric-Volume 42, Number 4, 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal rhetoric==

Rhetoric is practiced by [[social]] animals in a variety of ways. For example, birds use [[Bird vocalization|song]], various animals warn members of their species of danger, [[chimpanzee]]s have the capacity to deceive through communicative keyboard systems, and deer stags compete for the attention of mates. While these might be understood as [[Animal communication|rhetorical actions]] (attempts at persuading through meaningful actions and [[utterance]]s), they can also be seen as rhetorical fundamentals shared by humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Rhetoric: An Historical and Cross-Cultural Introduction|last=Kennedy|first=George A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-19-510932-5|location=New York|pages=11–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of animal rhetoric has been described as biorhetorics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]] 2001. [https://www.academia.edu/6409666/On_biorhetorics A note on biorhetorics]. ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'' 29(2): 693–704.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[self-awareness]] required to practice rhetoric might be difficult to notice and acknowledge in some animals. However, some animals are capable of acknowledging themselves in a mirror, and therefore, they might be understood to be self-aware and engaged in rhetoric when practicing some form of language, and therefore, rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Diane|date=2011|title=Creaturely Rhetorics|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|volume=44|issue=1|pages=88–94|doi=10.5325/philrhet.44.1.0088|jstor=10.5325/philrhet.44.1.0088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropocentrism plays a significant role in human-animal relationships, reflecting and perpetuating binaries in which humans are assumed to be beings that "have" extraordinary qualities while animals are regarded as beings that "lack" those qualities. This [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] is manifested through other forms as well, such as reason and sense, mind and body, ideal and phenomenon in which the first category of each pair ([[reason]], [[mind]], and [[Platonic ideal|ideal]]) represents and belongs to only humans. By becoming aware of and overcoming these [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] conceptions including the one between humans and animals, human knowledge of themselves and the world is expected to become more complete and holistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segeerdahl|first=Pär|date=2015|title=The rhetoric and prose of the human/animal contrast|journal=Language &amp; Communication|volume=42|pages=36–49|doi=10.1016/j.langcom.2015.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between humans and animals (as well as the rest of the natural world) is often defined by the human rhetorical act of naming and categorizing animals through [[Taxonomy (biology)|scientific]] and [[Folk taxonomy|folk]] labeling. The act of naming partially defines the rhetorical relationships between humans and animals, though both may be understood to engage in rhetoric beyond human naming and categorizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melzow|first=Candice Chovanec|date=Spring 2012|title=Identification, Naming, and Rhetoric in The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness and The Maine Woods|journal=Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment|volume=19.2|issue=2|pages=356–74|doi=10.1093/isle/iss084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the binary assumptions deriving from [[anthropocentrism]], which regarded animals as creatures without extraordinarily qualities, it does exist some specific animals with a sort of [[Phronesis|phrónēsis]] which confers them capabilities to "learn and receive instruction" with rudimentary understanding of some significant signs. Those animals do practice deliberative, judicial, and [[epideictic]] rhetoric deploying [[ethos]], [[logos]], and [[pathos]] with gesture and preen, sing and growl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=George|date=1992|title=A Hoot in the Dark The evolution of general rhetoric|jstor=40238276|journal=Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric|volume=25|number=1|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since animals offer models of rhetorical behavior and interaction that are physical, even instinctual, but perhaps no less artful, getting rid of our accustomed focus on verbal language and consciousness concepts will help people interested in rhetoric and communication matters promote human-animals' rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawhee|first=D.|date=2011|title=Toward a Bestial Rhetoric|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|volume=44|number=1|pages=81–87|doi=10.5325/philrhet.44.1.0081|jstor=10.5325/philrhet.44.1.0081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarada Charan Das''' (1906-1992) was an Indian [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[polymath]], [[scientist]], [[confectioner]], [[entrepreneur]] and [[businessman]]. He was the youngest son and successor of [[Krishna Chandra Das]] ([[K.C. Das]]) and the grandson of the legendary [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[confectioner]] [[Nobin Chandra Das]] (the inventor of the [[Rossogolla]] and widely known as the [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] of [[Rossogolla]] ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bishwanath Ghosh |title=Longing, Belonging: An Outsider At Home In Calcutta |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C4obBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT177 |date=29 October 2014 |publisher=Westland |isbn=978-93-84030-60-5 |page=177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in the year 1906 (in Bagbazaar, Kolkata, India), he established the first confectionery company in [[India]], named '''K.C. Das Private Limited''', in 1946.&lt;ref name="kcdas.co.in"&gt;http://www.kcdas.co.in/profile.php&lt;/ref&gt; Sarada Charan had varied talents and interests,ranging from sports at the international level (being a member of the official Indian weight-lifting delegation at the [[Olympics|Melbourne Olympics]] in 1956) to Bengali art and culture.&lt;ref name="http://www.kcdas.co.in/sarada.php"&gt;http://www.kcdas.co.in/sarada.php&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered as the founding father of '''K.C. Das Private Limited''' and a major innovator and pioneer of the Bengali [[sweetmeat]] [[industry]] due to his contributions towards revamping, modernizing and scientifically standardizing the [[confectionery]] [[industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-neighbourhood/white-soft-and-dropinthemouth-gorgeous/article911729.ece White, soft and drop-in-the-mouth gorgeous]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth &amp; Early Life ==

Sarada Charan was born in 1906 to the noted [[confectioner]] family of the Das'es of [[Bagbazar]] as the youngest son of [[Krishna Chandra Das]] ([[K.C. Das]]), in [[Kolkata]], [[India]]. At the age of eighteen, Sarada Charan married Annapurna Devi (1912-1996)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myheritage.com/names/charan_das&lt;/ref&gt; the twelve-year-old daughter of Dr. Mahendranath Indra, a reputed Civil Surgeon. Annapurna became the driving force behind her husband, and over the years grew to become the anchor of her large and extended family. Noted for the largeness of her heart and her hospitality and kindness, she left a deep impression on all who came in contact with her. Her interactions with the wide circle of her family, friends, husband’s friends and acquaintances were marked with genuine love and care, and it was generally acknowledged that the real moving spirit of the Das household was Annapurna.

Being of an intellectual bent of mind, in his early twenties, after completing a degree from [[Vidyasagar College]], Sarada Charan initially pursued a career in scientific research&lt;ref name="blazelead.com"&gt;http://www.blazelead.com/K-C-Das-Private-Limited/aboutus/&lt;/ref&gt; under physicist and [[Nobel Laureate]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.karnataka.com/personalities/cv-raman/&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[C.V. Raman]]&lt;ref&gt;http://pagelous.com/en/pages/5357b9e6421aa998ca089820&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Rajabazar Science College]], between 1926 and 1930.&lt;ref name="kcdas.co.in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; However, the expectations of his business family and the social customs of his times were not in favour of Sarada Charan's scientific ambitions. His father [[Krishna Chandra Das (K.C.Das)|Krishna Chandra]] strongly opposed the idea of his son accepting any form of employment beyond the parameters of their prestigious family business.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMCbYULUB8g&lt;/ref&gt; In order to engage and induct his youngest and apparently most talented son into the confectionery business, [[Krishna Chandra Das]] started a brand new venture at [[Jorasanko|Jorasako]] in 1930 appointing Sarada Charan at the helm of affairs. This shop was christened after [[Krishna Chandra Das]] and later modified by Sarada Charan to its now universally recognised modern form “[[K.C. Das]]”. This is where father and son amalgamated their ideas to come up with the canned form of their family's signature dish [[Rossogolla]] in 1930; which was also the first [[Canning|canned]] [[Sweets|sweet]] manufactured in India.&lt;ref name="indiamart.com"&gt;http://www.indiamart.com/kcdas-pvt/aboutus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contribution to Bengali Confectionery ==

After the early death of [[Krishna Chandra Das (K.C.Das)|Krishna Chandra]] ([[K.C. Das]]) in 1934, Sarada Charan quickly expanded his father’s business beyond the Jorasanko shop. He added a number of new outlets in Kolkata, beginning with the shop at Esplanade East under his father’s name in 1935.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indiamart.com"/&gt; This was the first time that the shop’s name was shortened to the crisper ‘[[K.C. Das]]’ from the original [[Krishna Chandra Das]]. This shop broke new ground in the traditional Bengali confectionery business in many ways.He introduced uniformed employees and western-style table service to seated customers. His passion for innovation took him to Japan in 1938, from where he brought back fine porcelain crockery for use in his shop, as well as Japanese handicrafts to be distributed to his customers as gifts.

Sarada Charan even revolutionized the way traditional Bengali sweets were packed, replacing the customary "[[Shorea robusta|sal]]" leaf packing with [[Parchment paper|butter-paper]] lined white cardboard cake boxes in the manner of European confectioners. The family tradition of innovation in new sweets continued unbroken with Sarada Charan creating the first sweets for diabetics and the “Amrita Kumbha [[Sandesh (confectionery)|Sondesh]]”, an exciting departure from all extant conventions of shape and taste. He also introduced the “[[Sandesh (confectionery)|Sondesh]] Cake” and “Ice-cream [[Sandesh (confectionery)|Sondesh]]”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiamart.com/kcdas-grandson-limited/#profile&lt;/ref&gt; in order to compete with western confectionery products and dairy desserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Agriculture and Industry Survey|volume=12|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMjsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Sarada+Charan+das%22&amp;dq=%22Sarada+Charan+das%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w_pIVO-0NsLd8AXkzoHYCg&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarada Charan’s greatest contribution, however, was not just to the final products of confectionery but to the cooking process itself. He conceived, designed and built a system to use steam generated from a boiler passed through steam-jacketed pans to cook traditional Indian sweetmeats,replacing the coal/wood burning stoves and conventional “kadais”.&lt;ref name="rediff.com"&gt;http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-shokeywords/slide-show-1-how-the-rasogolla-became-a-global-name/20111116.htm#7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports and social activities ==

Sarada Charan was a man of varied interests and passions. He became the chief patron of the [[Bagbazar]] United Club (established in 1924) and [[Bagbazar]] Gymnasium Club (established in 1910), and promoted their activities for many years. From organizing endurance swimming contests in the Ganga to being a member of the official Indian weight-lifting delegation at the [[Olympics|Melbourne Olympics]] in 1956, he was actively involved for several decades in a wide range of sports and events. He had been the President of the prestigious Bagbazaar Sarbojanin Durgotsab and Exhibition Committee between 1961 and 1965. Sarada Charan was also the Founder Secretary of the Bagbazaar Sarbajonin Durgotsab Trust and thereafter became its President. He was also a member of the [[Indian Science Congress]].&lt;ref name="http://www.kcdas.co.in/sarada.php"/&gt;

== Patronizing Art and culture ==

Sarada Charan was connected closely with the rise and flourishing of the [[Bengal School of Art|Bengal School]] in the visual arts, being one of the most significant sponsors and patron of artists such as [[Jamini Roy]], Shuvo Thakur and Gopal Ghosh. [[Jamini Roy]]'s greatest gift of gratitute to his dear friend and benefactor Sarada Charan was his magnum opus – the “[[Ramayana]]”. Spread across seventeen canvases, [[Jamini Roy]]’s “[[Ramayana]]” is on display today at the Das residence “[[Rossogolla]] Bhavan" in Kolkata. The Das residence today harbors the largest private collection of [[Jamini Roy]] paintings with 25 of the master’s originals.

Performing arts and artistes also drew his attention and interest, as many maestros of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindusthani classical music]] and dance were invited to perform at his home. From [[Shanta Rao]] and [[Sitara Devi]] to Pandit Shamta Prasad, Birendra Kishore Roy Chowdhury of Gauripur and Ustad Dabir Khan, it was rare to find an artiste of stature in those decades who had not graced a soiree at the Das household. This galaxy of reputed musicians also included Anath Nath Basu, Dhirendra Chandra Mitra, Uday Bhushan Bhattacharya, Ata Hosein Khan and Shailaja Ranjan Majumdar, all of whom also taught music to the children of the Das household. Sarada Charan’s love for the arts ensured that each of his children was schooled formally in a performing art. His varied interests also helped to nurture his friendship with an illustrious circle drawn from every sphere of intellectual and cultural activity in India in those days. [[Bidhan Chandra Roy|Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy]], the legendary physician-Chief Minister of West Bengal, was their family physician from the time of his grandmother,Khirodmoni Devi,(the grand-daughter of the legendary confectioner and poet Bhola Maira) and he held the family in great affection. Sarada Charan counted among his close friends the biologist [[J.B.S. Haldane]] and his wife, Bengali film stars [[Kanan Devi]] and [[Chhaya Devi]], the statistician [[P.C. Mahalanobis]], the revolutionary [[Lokenath Bal]], Tagore disciple Amal Home, the scholars Nirmal Bose and Suniti Chattopadhyay, and many others. Completing this galaxy of luminaries were the Shankar family members: the internationally famous dancers [[Uday Shankar]] and [[Amala Shankar]], the sitarist [[Pandit Ravi Shankar]] and their next generation - [[Ananda Shankar]] and [[Mamata Shankar]], who were also related by marriage to Sarada Charan’s fourth son Dhirendranath Das. Apart from them were Dr. Panchanan Chattopadhyay, Dr. R. Ahmed, Dr. Bankim Mukhopadhyay, and the then leaders of Bengal Dhiren Mukhopadhyay, Atulya Ghosh and Prafulla Sen. The critical link between the medical luminaries and the Dases, was the brother of Annapurna, Dr. Major Hemanta Kumar Indra who retired as the Principal of [[R. G. Kar Medical College]], Kolkata and was also the Deputy Director of Health Services, [[Government of West Bengal]].&lt;ref name="http://www.kcdas.co.in/sarada.php"/&gt;

== Experimental ventures ==

Sarada Charan’s bent of mind was highly scientific.&lt;ref name="rediff.com"/&gt; Oriented towards innovations and discoveries, he spent a lot of his energies on new projects. In the early 1940s he purchased a small [[Austin]] car, and tried to run it on a fuel other than petrol. Though he was way ahead of his time in terms of such innovative ideas, hecould not make much headway. In 1948, both Sarada Charan and his wife went to [[Europe]] for one and a half years. They lived in [[London]] for a short while, and in [[Switzerland]] where they stayed close to a year. While in [[Switzerland]] he collaborated with the Swiss Company ‘Rebella’ and tried to start a whey drink in India, which did not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcdas.co.in/production.php&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In the 1950s, he started a company called ‘Sunshade’ which produced awnings. [[Bata Shoes|Bata]] and [[Burmah Oil|Burma Shell]] were among its regular clientele. This company was managed by a friend of his and his third son. After the death of his friend the production trickled down and the venture had to be abandoned. Around the same time, Sarada Charan also tried to invent a mechanized [[tabla]] which could be tuned by turning knobs, instead of manually. Though all these projects were left incomplete, they illustrate the inventive and creative way in which his mind worked continually.&lt;ref name="http://www.kcdas.co.in/sarada.php"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indiamart.com"/&gt;

== Establishment of K.C.Das Grandsons ==

In 1955, Sarada Charan had a major disagreement with his second son Debendra Nath, leading to a permanent estrangement within the family. Debendra Nath left his ancestral home and family business and went on to establish an independent entity,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcdas.com/about&lt;/ref&gt; [[K.C. Das Grandsons|K.C. Das Grandsons Private Limited]], in 1956.

== Expansion of K.C.Das to South India ==

To combat acute scarcity of milk, the [[West Bengal]] government introduced a Milk Trade Control Order in 1965.This legislation severely curtailed the supply of milk to confectioners and resulted in a major negative impact on the business of Bengali confectioners. The [[K.C. Das]] company had to scale down operations drastically and barring the Esplanade establishment which sold savouries along with sweets, all the other K.C.Das shops were shut down, along with the historical [[Nobin Chandra Das]] establishment. West Bengal’s growing energy crisis and resultant shortage of electricity added to the organization’s problems.&lt;ref name="Sarada Charan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweet surrender, south and west - NEWER HORIZONS FOR RASOGOLLA|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050414/asp/calcutta/story_4611256.asp|accessdate=23 October 2014|publisher=The telegraph- Calcutta|date=14 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was in this context that the Sarada Charan started to explore alternative markets for his company.In 1972, Sarada Charan set up a factory and a shop in [[Bangalore]]. It has since then grown into a culinary landmark of the city, with the “[[Rasgulla|Rossogolla]]” naturally the most popular of its products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-sweet-journey/article3191911.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific research and methodology ==

Sarada Charan Das also gave a research and development perspective to the company’s activities. In 1946, he set up a fully equipped laboratory, the Indian Scientific Industries, at Chitpur Road in Kolkata. Extensive research work there involved the bacterial culture required for “dahi” (curds). It also worked on the nutritional value of whey, and ways to package and market it as a soft drink. Commercialization of [[lactose]] and [[lactic acid]] from whey was another project. This laboratory also did pioneering work on making sweetmeats from soybean milk in the 1960s, but these could not be commercially produced or beneficially sustained in economic terms.&lt;ref name="http://www.kcdas.co.in/rnd.php"&gt;http://www.kcdas.co.in/rnd.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Sarada Charan died at the age of 86, in 1992. His legacy continues to influence not only his own company but also the [[Bengali people|Bengali]]&lt;ref name=Sarada&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarada Charan Das|url=http://www.kcdas.co.in/sarada.php|website=kcdas.co.in|publisher=K.C. Das Private limited|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[confectionery]] [[industry]] at large. On the occasion of Sarada Charan’s birth centenary&lt;ref name="Sarada Charan Das"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarada Charan|first1=Das|title=Sweet, round memories|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1070701/asp/calcutta/story_7988525.asp|website=www.thetelegraphindia.com|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006 and the Platinum Jubliee of the “[[K.C. Das]]” confectionery, the company formally outlined its fourfold mission statement:&lt;ref name="blazelead.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://chamaar-today.blogspot.in/search?q=sarada+charan+das&lt;/ref&gt;

(1)  Focus on upholding the tradition and heritage of Bengali Sweets on the global platform and enhancing the global consumer’s awareness of traditional sweets and savories of India.

(2)  Standardizing the ingredient mix of indigenous sweetmeats and snack foods and upgrading and automating the production.

(3)  Focus on adopting suitable methods to control and standardize quality at every stage of the confectionery life-cycle, from raw-material procurement to the packaging of the product, thereby significantly increase the shelf-life of indigenous sweets and savories produced by mechanized processes.

(4)  To establish a worldwide vibrant market for Indian sweets and snacks.&lt;ref name="kcdas.co.in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.kcdas.co.in/rnd.php"/&gt;

== Children ==

Sarada Charan and Annapurna Devi had seven children, Rabindra Nath Das (1927-2000), Debendra Nath Das (1930-2010), Narendra Nath Das (1932-1993), Dhirendra Nath Das (1934–2018), Birendranath Das (1935–present), Monika Das (1937-1940) and Manjulika Das (1939-2012)

''Sidlaphadi'' near [[Badami]] in [[Karnataka]], is a natural rock bridge and pre historic rock shelter. It is located at about four km. in the middle of a shrub jungle near the historic town of Badami. A bridle and kutcha path through sandstone hills from Badami leads to Sidlaphadi and there is no metal road to the spot. ''Sidlaphadi'' literally means in Kannada the ''Rock of lightning'', derived from gaping holes in the natural rock arch, which was formed when a lightning struck.&lt;ref name=arun&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhat|first1=Arun|title=Struck by lightning|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/41256/ipl-2012.html|accessdate=13 August 2014|publisher=Deccan Herald|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The natural rock bridge structure looks like a ''wide arch'' between two sandstone boulders (served as a roof). The rock structure has large, gaping holes in the arch and allows sunlight to enter inside which provides the required light for interiors. It was also a shelter for hunter-gatherer prehistoric people.

There is a replica of Sidlaphadi in the Badami archaeological museum, it is dedicated to recreate Sidlaphadi and has posters to provide relevant information about the evolution of man.

There are evidences to prove that the Sidlaphadi was a dwelling of prehistoric man.

==Prehistoric rock art==

This natural rock bridge structure was studied by archaeologist Shri A. Sundar, who identified prehistoric (now fading) paintings on the roof of the arch. The blunt weapons of stone were also discovered in the area.&lt;ref name=arun/&gt;

A '''strongback''' is a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] or [[girder]] which acts as a secondary support member to existing structure. A strongback in a staircase is usually ordinary two-by [[Lumber#Dimensional lumber|dimensional lumber]] attached to the staircase stringers to stiffen the assembly. In [[shipbuilding]], a strongback is oriented lengthwise along a [[ship]] to brace across several frames in the case of [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] damage.{{CN|date=September 2016}}

Some rockets like the [[Antares (rocket)]], the [[Falcon 9]] and the [[Falcon Heavy]] use a strongback to restrain the rocket prior to launch. This structure reclines several degrees away from the rocket to clear the launch, either at the moment of launch or in some case a few minutes before.

[[Image:Yangdun01.JPG|thumb|200px|A rendering of the position of the symbols and counts of No. 1 Yang Dun array for Tai Yi divination. The entire series consists of 72 Yang Dun and 72 Yin Dun arrays for Tai Yi.]]

'''Tai Yi Shen Shu''' is a form of divination from China. It is also one of the Three Styles ({{zh|labels=no|c=三式|p=sānshì|l=three rites}}) of divination, the others being [[Da Liu Ren]] and [[Qi Men Dun Jia]]. 

Tai Yi Shen Shu is used to predict macroscopic events like wars or the meaning of supernovae. One form of Tai Yi Shen Shu has been popularized over the centuries to predict personal fortunes. [[Genghis Khan]], emperor of China, referred to Tai Yi at one point to decide whether or not his planned invasion of Japan would succeed. When the Tai Yi count indicated that invasion would prove unsuccessful, Khan decided not to invade Japan that year. Numerous similar examples abound in classical Chinese literature, especially among the dynastic histories.

The methodology is quite similar to the other arts with a rotating heavenly plate and fixed earthly plate. While the art makes use of the 8 trigrams as well as the 64 hexagrams as a foundation, analysis is conducted from the Tai Yi Cosmic Board and the array of symbols found thereon, with special reference to the position of symbols in specific palaces. Important symbols include the Calculator, the Scholar, Tai Yi and Tai Yi, for example. 

A number of spirits rotate around the sixteen palaces of the Tai Yi cosmic board, of which there are 72 cosmic boards for the Yin Dun period of each year, and 72 cosmic boards for the Yang Dun period of the year. The spirits land in different palaces with each configuration of the cosmic board. Each cosmic board contains a number of "counts" or numbers - the Host Count and the Guest Count taking primary importance over the Fixed Count.

==Plot==
{{long plot|date=January 2014}}
Mia Sullivan ([[Monica Calhoun]]), wife of Lance Sullivan ([[Morris Chestnut]]), has written letters requesting that the old gang should join them for Christmas: Harper Stewart ([[Taye Diggs]]) and his almost-nine-month-pregnant wife Robyn ([[Sanaa Lathan]]), Julian "Murch" Murchison ([[Harold Perrineau]]) and wife Candace Sparks ([[Regina Hall]]), her best friend Jordan Armstrong ([[Nia Long]]) and boyfriend Brian McDonald ([[Eddie Cibrian]]), Quentin "Q" Spivey ([[Terrence Howard]]), and Shelby Taylor ([[Melissa De Sousa]]). All the friends arrive at the house, the first time they've come together in 14 years, and the celebration begins. At dinner, the old friends catch up while tensions grow between Shelby and Candace.

Years after his debut novel, Harper is struggling with [[writer's block]], financial difficulties, and pressure from his publisher to come up with newer and better material for his next book. He has also been recently relieved of his faculty position at [[New York University]], further complicating the couple's financial position. He kept all this from Robyn, as she is finally pregnant with their first child after years of expensive fertility treatments and the baby is almost full-term. His agent suggests he write a biography on his estranged friend, Lance, who is set to retire from football. Harper reluctantly agrees, but keeps the biography a secret.

The Murch family, which now includes two daughters, seems to be doing well.  Julian opened the school he has worked hard to establish, with his wife, former stripper Candace, as his head of admissions. His main donor, however, abruptly ends his relationship with the school and Julian: he has been made aware of Candace's past and will not risk his reputation as a man of high morals. It is then that Julian finds a [[YouTube]] video of his wife stripping and accepting money for sex at a fraternity party. He confides in Q and shows him part of the video. Shelby is living the life she has always dreamed of: as a cast member of a popular ''[[The Real Housewives]]'' television show franchise, she is now a prominent and notorious [[reality television]] star and part of the social elite. Robyn is still insecure about Harper and Jordan's friendship. Q is now a successful [[brand]] manager and heavily connected to prominent celebrities.

After arriving at the Sullivan home, Harper notices Mia's dramatic weight loss, but brushes it off and focuses on the reunion and gathering information about Lance for the biography.

The next day, Brian says goodbye to Jordan and leaves for his family's annual [[Christmas]] gathering in [[Vermont]]. As he leaves, Jordan tells him that, while she loves him, she does not need him. After dinner that night, the men dance and lip-sync to "[[Can You Stand the Rain]]" for the ladies to great response. All the couples in the house have sex that night, while Lance gives Mia a back-rub and Q sends risque photographs of himself to Shelby. Harper goes down to the kitchen, and as he heads back to bed, he finds Mia throwing up blood.

Mia reveals to Harper that she was diagnosed with cancer more than a year ago and is dying. After Lance walks in on the two talking, Mia explains to Lance that Harper knows. They both ask Harper to keep the condition a secret. At breakfast the next morning, Q and Shelby accidentally switch phones and Shelby finds the Candace video on Q's phone. She tries to use it to coerce Julian to resume his previous relationship with her, but Julian rebuffs her advances. Not long afterwards, Candace loses patience with Shelby and confronts her, which leads to a physical altercation between the two in front of Shelby's daughter, after which Candace leaves the house with her and Julian's daughters. Lance drives the men to his football practice, with Julian and Q starting a fight in the backseat, but Harper intervenes before it degenerates further.

Back at the house, the ladies are preparing for a spa day when Mia collapses while trying to hang a Christmas ornament. Robyn and Jordan text Harper for Lance and the men quickly return to the house, forcing Harper to tell the rest of the friends about Mia's illness. As they leave, the friends all embrace Lance.

Back at the house, everyone spends time with Mia. While Harper is wrapping gifts, Lance approaches him and the two reminisce about their college days and seem to overcome their differences. The next day, the gang volunteer at a shelter, with Q as a grudging [[Santa Claus]]. Harper and Lance seem to be as close as they were in the old days. Afterwards, Lance stumbles across Harper's iPad and journal in Mia's purse, and a mock book cover for his unauthorized biography on the tablet. Lance angrily confronts Harper and tells him to stay away from him and his family. Mia tries to calm Lance down to no avail. He takes Mia home, leaving Q and Harper the last two to leave the shelter. The two talk and Harper finally breaks down and admits the truth of his situation.

Back at the Sullivan home, Robyn is going through Mia's old baby things when Candace returns with the kids. Candace tells Julian she regrets that one time she ever gave "extra favors" to a client and they reconcile. Lance is still heated over the biography when Mia confronts him. Mia challenges Lance to acknowledge the truth. She is to blame just as much as Harper is for the longtime feud between the two men. She reveals she slept with Harper (see [[The Best Man (1999 film)|The Best Man]]), even though she knew how much it would hurt Lance, because she was sick and tired of Lance cheating on her. Mia then takes off her wig, forcing Lance to also acknowledge the severity of her condition. The household gathers around the fireplace to listen to the children sing Christmas carols.

The next day is Christmas and Lance's big game. Brian returns to be with Jordan and the two reconcile. The women watch the game together as a family in Mia and Lance's bedroom, while the men attend the game. Lance starts a troublesome first half. Mia calls Harper to speak to Lance, inspiring him to ultimately break the all-time rushing record in a game-winning performance. After the game, the men rush home, so Lance can say goodbye to Mia before she dies.

At the funeral service, everyone but Lance is emotional. Shelby gives Julian a check for two million dollars, covering the funding gap created by the donor pull-out. All she asks for in return is a play date for their children. Inside the church, Harper gives a heartfelt eulogy. After everyone leaves, as Mia's casket is lowered into the grave, Lance finally breaks down. Harper witnesses this from a distance and rushes to Lance's aid, comforting him. Back at the house, everyone seems to have reconciled with one another after realizing what's really important in life. Outside, Harper and Lance make up and conclude a 14-year feud. Q and Shelby are shown in bed, with Q suggesting, before rolling out of bed, they may have a love connection. Meanwhile, Brian tells Julian that he knows some investors who can help with the school's funding. Robyn's water suddenly breaks, so Lance, Harper, and Candace all try to rush her to the hospital together. However, they get stuck in traffic and Lance delivers the baby in the backseat of his [[SUV]]. Robyn delivers a healthy baby girl and names her Mia, in honor of their deceased friend.

Ten months later, Harper and Lance are closer than ever and Harper has written Lance's biography. Lance is the baby's godfather, as he visits Harper and Robyn at their house in [[New York City]]. Harper gets a phone call from Q and puts it on speakerphone to share the call with Lance. Q reveals to both that he is getting married and wants Harper to be his best man, but not before telling Harper that he better not have had sex with his soon-to-be bride.

''[[The Washington Post]]''{{-'}}s Ann Hornaday gave it 2.5 stars, saying the "[s]equel is both a romp and a tearjerker... Like a long-lost soap opera emerging from a Rip Van Winkle–length hiatus, 'The Best Man Holiday' has lost none of its often baggy, saggy melodrama; luckily, when things get too soppy, Howard can be depended on for crude one-liners that land with all the more finesse thanks to his smoky, slightly stoned delivery. …And 'The Best Man Holiday' has clearly caught up with the times, with one plot point revolving around social media run amok, off-handedly invoking everyone from [[Barack Obama]] (natch) to [[Melissa Harris-Perry]], [[Olivia Pope]] and [[Robin Thicke]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/the-best-man-holiday-movie-review-sequel-is-both-a-romp-and-a-shameless-tearjerker/2013/11/13/7a43d000-4c68-11e3-be6b-d3d28122e6d4_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |title='The Best Man Holiday' movie review: Sequel is both a romp and a shameless tearjerker |first=Ann |last=Hornaday |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27917">[[File:Horse thieves.jpg|thumb|400px|This drawing appears on all membership certificates of the Society.]]
'''The Society in Dedham for Apprehending Horse Thieves''' is "the oldest continually existing [[horse thief]] apprehending organization in the [[United States]], and one of [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]]’s most venerable social organizations."&lt;ref name=SocietyWeb/&gt;&lt;ref name=what/&gt;&lt;ref name=oldest/&gt;  Since its founding there have been more than 10,000 members including heads of state, Supreme Court justices, governors, popes, professors, generals, and other notables.&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt;

At one time membership of the "ancient and well known society"&lt;ref name=both/&gt; was limited to "the pillars of society" and the "very flower and pick of the vigor, manhood and rising youth of the vicinity."&lt;ref name=selected/&gt;  It has also been said that "for sheer whimsy, the Society... is without peer."&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt;  Today it is a tax exempt non-profit social organization&lt;ref name=tax/&gt; that continues to meet "just in case."&lt;ref name=Savings/&gt;

==Early years==
[[File:Norfolk House.jpg|thumb|right|The Society was formed inside the Norfolk House, then known as Marsh's Tavern.]]
At the turn of the 19th century the citizens of [[Dedham, Massachusetts]] came together to combat the rash of horse thievery that was afflicting their community.  At the time, "this posse of vigilantes was a real civic necessity,"&lt;ref name=posse/&gt; and during that time period at least 72 such organizations existed in New England.&lt;ref name=stop/&gt;{{rp|407}}  Thirteen men&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; first met on June 4, 1810, at Marsh’s Tavern on Court Street and opened a subscription list, noting that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The great number of horses stolen from amongst us and in our vicinity is truly alarming, and calls for the attention of every well-disposed Citizen. It is evident that there has been, and probably will continue, a combination of Villains through the northern states to carry into effect this malignant design, and their frequent escape from the hand of justice stimulates them to that atrocious practice. And as that kind of property is most liable to be carried out of our knowledge, it requires the utmost exertion of every good member of society, to baffle and suppress depredations of this kind...&lt;ref name=SocietyWeb/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On May 4, 1832,&lt;ref name=branch/&gt; the Society opened a bank account at the [[Dedham Institution for Savings]] and the account remains open today, and the bank claims that the account "may be the oldest continuously active account in the United States."&lt;ref name=Savings/&gt;&lt;ref name=howard/&gt; It is the oldest active account at Dedham Savings.&lt;ref name=branch/&gt;

==Membership==
Anyone may be nominated for membership so long as the $10 (In 1906 it was $1&lt;ref name=chase/&gt;) membership fee is paid.  Applications for membership in the Society must be approved by a majority vote by current members and a "controversial nomination years ago of [[Ali Khamenei|Ayatollah Khamenei]] of [[Iran]] was not seconded."&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;  By 1960, the president of the Society reported that "memberships are as coveted as the [[Kentucky Colonel]]s."&lt;ref name=great/&gt;

The person receiving honor of the membership in the society need not even know that they had been nominated.  Robert Hanson, who has followed in the steps of his father and grandfather as clerk-treasurer of the Society, has said "I've always wondered what the reaction in the Vatican mail room is when they open the envelope and see the certificate."&lt;ref name=Sweeney/&gt; Former Massachusetts governor [[Michael Dukakis]] is a member, though when a reporter asked him he said he had never heard of the Society.&lt;ref name=WA/&gt;

Membership was originally limited to residents of Dedham but restrictions were loosened over the years to limit membership to residents of [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]]; or to residents of Norfolk and [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]]  Counties; or to persons resident within a 20-mile radius of the Norfolk County Courthouse; or to residents of Dedham, [[Norwood, Massachusetts|Norwood]], [[Westwood, Massachusetts|Westwood]], or [[Dover, Massachusetts|Dover]].  Eventually all residency restrictions were lifted.  The club's website claims that [[Robert Ripley]] of [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] fame had applied for membership before this restriction was eliminated, and the clerk-treasurer returned his application with a note rejecting his application.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dear Mr. Ripley:

Since you are not a resident of Dedham (or Norwood, or Westwood, or Dover, or Norfolk County, of Suffolk County), you cannot join our Society.

Believe it or not,

Charles M. Gibson.&lt;ref name=SocietyWeb/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Investigations and rescues==
The Society has been called upon four times&lt;ref name=stop/&gt;{{rp|436}} and there is only one instance of a horse thief being caught by the Society.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt;&lt;ref name=neigh/&gt;

In 1906 an animal was stolen from Scarry’s Livery Stable on Eastern Avenue.  The alarm was raised, fliers were distributed, and members set off in motor cars, but they failed to find the stolen horse.&lt;ref name=SocietyWeb/&gt;&lt;ref name=both/&gt;&lt;ref name=stop/&gt;{{rp|431}}  While by this time the Town of Dedham had a professional police force who was primarily responsible for tracking down the thief,&lt;ref name=stop/&gt;{{rp|431}} at one point the chief of police was reporting to the Society.&lt;ref name=SocietyWeb/&gt;

The clerk of the society reported at the annual meeting that though the animal was not recovered, it was not for a lack of trying:  "It is only fair to the Riders of this Society to state that the owner of the horse even consulted mediums in his efforts to find the horse. This only proves that our Riders did their full duty, as the horse could not be found."&lt;ref name=SocietyWeb/&gt;

By 1906, with the advent of the automobile, the world, and the Society, were changing, prompting the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' to run the following Dedham Dittie:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was not like that in the olden says in dear old Dedham town,

In the limping, scrimping olden days, when they ran a horse thief down.

Then each man rode off on his fastest horse, and he rode both fast and far,

But now the rider hunts the thief in a chugging motor car.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last time the Society investigated a horse theft was in 1909, although though a number of pranks between members set off false alarms after that.  In days when vigilante justice was a major component of the Society, "not a few horse thieves were apprehended by the organization of the long name."&lt;ref name=chase/&gt;

===Proposed switch to automobiles===
By 1915, it was said that "without doubt" the organization's existence scared away potential horse thieves, as evidenced by the decreasing number of thefts of horses and increasing number of automobile thefts.&lt;ref name=quiet/&gt;  President George F. Joyce proposed changing the purpose of the organization to those who steal automobiles and auto parts.&lt;ref name=date/&gt;  In 1921&lt;ref name=point/&gt; and 1924,&lt;ref name=catchers/&gt; the Society was still debating whether to turn its attention to car thieves.  In 1925 no horses were stolen, but a cow was recovered.&lt;ref name=cow/&gt;

In 1932, it was proposed that a Society in Dedham for Apprehending Hit-and-Run Drivers would be a good successor organization.&lt;ref name=hit/&gt;  It was also predicted that by 2032, when human flight would be common, that there would be a Society for Apprehending Reckless Aviators over Dedham.&lt;ref name=hit/&gt;  A newspaper in West Virginia once suggested that the Society not only turn its attention to catching auto thieves, but [[Anarchism|anarchists]] as well.&lt;ref name=anarchist/&gt;

==Move to a social organization==
By 1899, horse thefts were becoming so rare that newspapers as far away as The Evening Times of Washington, D.C. were noting that "it might seem to the ordinary observer that the members ought to devote themselves to something worth doing, now that their particular object in life has disappeared."&lt;ref name=fossil/&gt;  However, in 1931 it was said that "Dedham doesn't purpose to let an old tradition languish simply for lack of horse thieves."&lt;ref name=posse/&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, under the guidance of its new president, Dr. Edward Knobel, its annual meeting became a social event with dinner, drink, and entertainment.  [[Elbert Hubbard]] was the keynote speaker at the annual dinner in 1908.  He spoke on the poetry of [[Robert Browning]] and said "a more refined and intelligent audience I never saw."  He reported that the membership was limited to 350 men and that there was a perpetual waiting list to join with "the slightest fleck on your social record" being cause to be rejected.&lt;ref name=hubbard/&gt;

The organization met in a variety of taverns and other public buildings around town throughout the years.&lt;ref name=SocietyWeb/&gt;  In 1893 the annual meeting was held at the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] hall in Dedham Square,&lt;ref name=gleaning/&gt; and 1907 the organization met at Greenleaf Hall.&lt;ref name=humphrey/&gt;  By 1920,&lt;ref name=dine/&gt; and as late as 1956,&lt;ref name=ledger/&gt; it met at Memorial Hall, where the Police Station now stands.  Eventually the meetings moved to the old high school around the time of the [[First World War]] and then to the current high school when it was constructed in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=SocietyWeb/&gt;  While alcohol was forbidden in the schools, it was a convenient setup with both a cafeteria and an auditorium, and surprise was expressed yearly at the variety of colors of "water" in glasses.&lt;ref name=SocietyWeb/&gt;  Attendance steadily increased at the annual meeting and beginning in the 1970s the organization met at [[Moseley’s on the Charles]].&lt;ref name=SocietyWeb/&gt;

In the early 1900s, the committee of Riders were elected based on their weight, "so that when a thief is captured his captors can sit on him to prevent him from escaping."&lt;ref name=anniversary/&gt;  Riders were required to weigh at least 200 pounds.&lt;ref name=what/&gt;&lt;ref name=oldest/&gt;&lt;ref name=great/&gt;&lt;ref name=zero/&gt;

The organization represented New England at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=groups/&gt;  Today, donations are occasionally made to local charitable organizations.&lt;ref name=oldest/&gt;&lt;ref name=zero/&gt;&lt;ref name=began/&gt;

==21st century==
The annual meeting of the Society takes place on the first Tuesday of December each year.  At the 192nd annual meeting in 2002 "more than 200 proud members... toasted their success last night at their annual meeting, a bacchanalian affair featuring bad jokes, old-time music, a generous amount of both spirit and spirits and a virtual who's who of political and business life."&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;  In 2007 members came from as far away as California, just to attend the dinner.&lt;ref name=Sweeney/&gt;  One member, whose "hulking frame could barely contain his enthusiasm for the group," told a reporter that the annual meeting was "the greatest event in the history of Dedham, ever.  And the best part is, it has no redeeming value whatsoever, except for pointless fun and unbelievable camaraderie."&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;

Some years, photos of horses are brought in "to acquaint riders who may never have seen one before."&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;  For many years it was a men's only club, but in 2012 Margo Pyle became the Society's first Rider, or one who is responsible for searching for horse thieves when one is stolen.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;  Being elected a Rider is "a position of signal honor."&lt;ref name=what/&gt;

==Offshoot organizations==
While many similar private anti-theft organizations existed at the time the Society was founded,&lt;ref name=stop/&gt; there have been at least two organizations inspired by the Society directly.  In 1841, 42 of 76 original members began a new organization, the Society in Dedham for Apprehending and Prosecuting Thieves.&lt;ref name=stop/&gt;{{rp|417}}  The Society in Hampton Beach for the Apprehension of Those Falsely Accusing Eunice (Goody) Cole of Having Familiarity with the Devil was formed in 1936 in direct response to learning about the Society in Dedham.&lt;ref name=witch/&gt;

The Horse Thieves Tavern at the corner of Washington and High Streets in Dedham Square also took its name from the Society.&lt;ref name=tavern/&gt;&lt;ref name=htt/&gt;

In [[cultural anthropology]] and [[cultural geography]], '''cultural diffusion''', as conceptualized by [[Leo Frobenius]] in his 1897/98 publication ''Der westafrikanische [[Kulturkreis]]'', is the spread of [[culture|cultural]] items—such as [[idea]]s, [[fashion|style]]s, [[religion]]s, [[technology|technologies]], [[contact linguistics|languages]]—between individuals, whether within a single culture or from one culture to another. It is distinct from the [[diffusion of innovations]] within a specific culture. Examples of diffusion include the spread of the [[war chariot]] and [[iron]] [[smelting]] in ancient times, and the use of [[automobile]]s and Western [[business suit]]s in the 20th century.

==Types==
Five major types of cultural diffusion have been defined:
* Expansion diffusion: an innovation or idea that develops in a source area and remains strong there, while also spreading outward to other areas. This can include hierarchical, stimulus, and contagious diffusion.
* Relocation diffusion: an idea or innovation that migrates into new areas, leaving behind its origin or source of the cultural trait.
* Hierarchical diffusion: an idea or innovation that spreads by moving from larger to smaller places, often with little regard to the distance between places, and often influenced by social elites.
* Contagious diffusion: an idea or innovation that spreads based on person-to-person contact within a given population.
* Stimulus diffusion: an idea or innovation that spreads based on its attachment to another concept.

==Mechanisms==
Inter-cultural diffusion can happen in many ways. [[Human migration|Migrating populations]] will carry their culture with them. Ideas can be carried by trans-cultural visitors, such as merchants, [[exploration|explorers]], soldiers, diplomats, slaves, and hired artisans. Technology diffusion has often occurred by one society luring skilled scientists or workers by payments or other inducement. Trans-cultural marriages between two neighboring or interspersed cultures have also contributed. Among literate societies, diffusion can occur through letters, books, and, in modern times, through electronic media.

There are three categories of diffusion mechanisms:
*'''Direct diffusion''' occurs when two cultures are very close to each other, resulting in intermarriage, trade, and even warfare. An example of direct diffusion is between the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], where the people living on the border of these two countries engage in hockey, which started in Canada, and baseball, which is popular in American culture.
*'''Forced diffusion''' occurs when one culture subjugates (conquers or enslaves) another culture and forces its own customs on the conquered people. An example would be the forced [[Christianity|Christianization]] of the [[indigenous peoples]] of the Americas by the Spanish, French, English and Portuguese, or the forced [[Islamization]] of West African peoples by the [[Fula people|Fula]] or of the [[Nuristan]]is by the Afghans.
*'''Indirect diffusion''' happens when traits are passed from one culture through a middleman to another culture, without the first and final cultures being in direct contact. An example could be the presence of [[Mexican food]] in Canada, since a large territory (the United States) lies between.

Direct diffusion was common in ancient times, when small groups of humans lived in adjoining settlements. Indirect diffusion is common in today's world because of the [[mass media]] and invention of the [[Internet]]. Also of interest is the work of [[United States|American]] historian and critic [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] in his book ''[[The Discoverers]]'', in which he provides an historical perspective on the role of [[exploration|explorers]] in the [[diffusion of innovations]] between [[civilization]]s.

==Theories==
The many models that have been proposed for inter-cultural diffusion are:
*[[Migrationism]], the spread of cultural ideas by either gradual or sudden population movements 
*[[Kulturkreis|Culture circles]] diffusionism (''Kulturkreise'')—the theory that cultures originated from a small number of cultures
* "''Kulturkugel''" (a German compound meaning "culture bullet", [[Neologism|coined]] by [[J. P. Mallory]]), a mechanism suggested by Mallory&lt;ref&gt;In the context of [[Indo-Aryan migration]]; Mallory, "A European Perspective on Indo-Europeans in Asia". In ''The Bronze Age and Early Iron Age Peoples of Eastern and Central Asia''. Ed. Mair. Washington D.C.: Institute for the Study of Man (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; to model the scale of [[invasion]] vs. gradual migration vs. diffusion. According to this model, local continuity of material culture and social organization is stronger than linguistic continuity, so that cultural contact or limited migration regularly leads to linguistic changes without affecting material culture or social organization.&lt;ref&gt;The term is a 'half-facetious' mechanical analogy, imagining a "bullet" of which the tip is material culture and the "charge" is language and social structure. Upon "intrusion" into a host culture, migrants will "shed" their material culture (the "tip") while possibly still maintaining their "charge" of language and, to a lesser extent, social customs (viz., the effect is a [[diaspora]] culture, which depending on the political situation may either form a [[substratum]] or a [[superstratum]] within the host culture).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trans-cultural diffusion#Hyperdiffusionism|Hyperdiffusionism]]—the theory that all cultures originated from one culture

A concept that has often been mentioned in this regard, which may be framed in the evolutionary diffusionism model, is that of "an idea whose time has come" — whereby a new cultural item appears almost simultaneously and independently in several widely separated places, after certain prerequisite items have diffused across the respective communities. This concept was invoked with regard to the independent development of [[calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibnitz]], and the inventions of the [[airplane]] and of the [[electronic computer]].

==Hyperdiffusionism==
{{Main article|Hyperdiffusionism in Archaeology}}
Hyperdiffusionists deny that [[parallel evolution]] or independent invention took place to any great extent throughout history; they claim that all major inventions and all cultures can be traced back to a single culture.&lt;ref&gt;Legend and lore of the Americas before 1492: an encyclopedia of visitors, explorers, and immigrants, Ronald H. Fritze, 1993, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Early theories of hyperdiffusionism can be traced to ideas about [[South America]] being the origin of mankind. [[Antonio de León Pinelo]], a Spaniard who settled in [[Bolivia]], claimed in his book ''Paraíso en el Nuevo Mundo'' that the [[Garden of Eden]] and the creation of man had occurred in present-day Bolivia and that the rest of the world was populated by [[Human migration|migration]]s from there. Similar ideas were also held by Emeterio Villamil de Rada; in his book ''La Lengua de Adán'' he attempted to prove that [[Aymaran languages|Aymara]] was the original language of mankind and that humanity had originated in [[Sorata]] in the Bolivian [[Andes]]. The first scientific defence of humanity originating in South America came from the Argentine [[paleontologist]] [[Florentino Ameghino]] in 1880, who published his research in ''La antigüedad del hombre en el Plata''.&lt;ref&gt;Indians of the Andes: Aymaras and Quechuas, Harold Osborne, 2004, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] fomented a revival of hyperdiffusionism in 1911; he asserted that [[copper]]–producing knowledge spread from [[Egypt]] to the rest of the world along with [[megalithic]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Routledge Dictionary of Anthropologists,'' Gérald Gaillard, 2004, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Smith claimed that all major inventions had been made by the ancient [[Egyptians]] and were carried to the rest of the world by migrants and voyagers. His views became known as "Egyptocentric-Hyperdiffusionism".&lt;ref&gt;Megaliths, Myths and Men: An Introduction to Astro-Archaeology, Peter Lancaster Brown, 2000, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; [[William James Perry]] elaborated on Smith's hypothesis by using [[ethnographic]] data. Another hyperdiffusionist was [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]; in his book ''How Came Civilization'' (1939) he wrote that instead of Egypt all culture and civilization had come from [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sociocultural Evolution: Calculation and Contingency,'' Bruce G. Trigger, 1998, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperdiffusionism after this did not entirely disappear, but it was generally abandoned by mainstream academia.

==Medieval Europe==
Diffusion theory has been advanced{{according to whom|date=July 2015}} as an explanation for the "[[European miracle]]", the adoption of technological innovation in [[medieval Europe]] which by the 17th century culminated in European technological achievement surpassing [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|the Islamic world]] and [[Ming China|China]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlo M. Cipolla, ''Before the Industrial revolution: European Society and Economy 1000–1700, W.W. Norton and Co., New York (1980) {{ISBN|0-393-95115-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Such technological import to medieval Europe include [[gunpowder]], [[clock]] mechanisms, [[shipbuilding]], [[paper]] and the [[windmill]], however, in each of these cases Europeans not only adopted the technologies, but improved the manufacturing scale, inherent technology, and applications to a point clearly surpassing the evolution of the original invention in its country of origin.

Historians{{who|date=July 2015}} have questioned recently{{year needed|date=July 2015}} whether Europe really owes the development of such inventions as gunpowder, the compass, the windmill or printing to the Chinese or other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson: ''The Mongols and the West'', Pearson Longman 2005, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald F. Lach]]: ''Asia in the Making of Europe''. 3 volumes, Chicago, Illinois, 1965–93; I:1, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bartlett: ''The Making of Europe. Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950–1350'', Allen Lane, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

However historian Peter Frankopan argues that influences, particularly trade, through the middle east &amp; central Asia to China through the silk roads have been overlooked in traditional histories of the "rise of the west". He argues that the renaissance was funded with trade with the east (due to the demise of Byzantium at the hands of Venice and the 4th Crusade), and that the trade allowed ideas and technology to be shared with Europe. But the constant warfare and rivalry in Europe meant there was extreme evolutionary pressure for developing these ideas for military and economic advantage, and a desperate need to use them in expansion.&lt;ref&gt;'The Silk Roads: A New History of the Workd' {{ISBN|9781101912379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputes==
{{further information|Migrationism and diffusionism}}
While the concept of diffusion is well accepted in general, conjectures about the existence or the extent of diffusion in some specific contexts have been hotly disputed. An example of such disputes is the proposal by [[Thor Heyerdahl]] that similarities between the culture of [[Polynesia]] and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the [[Andes]] are due to diffusion from the latter to the former—a theory that currently has few supporters among professional anthropologists.
Heyerdahl's theory of Polynesian origins has not gained acceptance among [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Suggs ''The Island Civilizations of Polynesia'', New York: New American Library, pp. 212-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirch, P. (2000). ''On the Roads to the Wind: An archaeological history of the Pacific Islands before European contact''. [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]: [[University of California Press]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barnes, S.S.|title=Ancient DNA of the Pacific rat (Rattus exulans) from Rapa Nui (Easter Island)|url=http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/People/Faculty/Hunt/pdfs/Barnesetal2006.pdf|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=33|issue=11|page=1536|year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2006.02.006|display-authors=etal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719205425/http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/People/Faculty/Hunt/pdfs/Barnesetal2006.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Physical and cultural evidence had long suggested that Polynesia was settled from west to east, migration having begun from the [[Asia]]n mainland, not South America. In the late 1990s, [[genetics|genetic]] testing found that the [[mitochondrial DNA]] of the Polynesians is more similar to people from southeast Asia than to people from South America, showing that their ancestors most likely came from Asia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Friedlaender, J.S.|title=The genetic structure of Pacific Islanders|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=4|issue=1|pages=e19|year=2008 |pmid=18208337|pmc=2211537|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0040019|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''uncanny''' is the [[psychological]] experience of something as ''strangely familiar'', rather than simply mysterious.&lt;ref&gt;Royle, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It may describe incidents where a familiar thing or event is encountered in an unsettling, eerie, or [[taboo]] context.&lt;ref&gt;Royle, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D. Bate, 2004 p. 39-40"&gt;D. Bate, ''Photography and Surrealism'' (2004) p. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the uncanny  was perhaps first fixed by [[Sigmund Freud]] in his 1919 essay ''Das Unheimliche'', which explores the eeriness of dolls and waxworks.&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;{{cite web |last=Freud |first=Sigmund |authorlink=Sigmund Freud |title=Das Unheimliche |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~amtower/uncanny.html |year=1919 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714192553/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~amtower/uncanny.html |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Freud, the uncanny locates the strangeness in the ordinary.&lt;ref name="D. Bate, 2004 p. 39-40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unheimliche"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lim |first=Dennis |authorlink= Dennis Lim|title=“David Lynch should be shot”: Looking back on the madness and chaos of “Blue Velvet” and Ronald Reagan’s ’80s |url=https://www.salon.com/2016/03/26/david_lynch_should_be_shot_looking_back_on_the_madness_and_chaos_of_blue_velvet_and_ronald_reagans_80s/ |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on the idea, [[psychoanalytic]] theorist [[Jacques Lacan]] wrote that the uncanny places us "in the field where we do not know how to distinguish bad and good, pleasure from displeasure", resulting in an irreducible [[anxiety]] that gestures to [[the Real]]. The concept has since been taken up by a variety of subsequent thinkers and theorists such as Roboticist [[Masahiro Mori (roboticist)|Masahiro Mori]]'s "[[uncanny valley]]" hypothesis and [[Julia Kristeva]]'s concept of [[abjection]].

==History==

===German idealism===
Philosopher [[F. W. J. Schelling]] raised the question of the uncanny in his late ''Philosophie der Mythologie'' of 1835, postulating that the Homeric clarity was built upon a prior repression of the uncanny.&lt;ref&gt;A. Vidler, ''The Architectural Uncanny'' (1994) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' manuscript, German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] refers to [[nihilism]] as "the uncanniest of all guests" and, earlier, in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' he argues it is the "will to truth" that has destroyed the [[metaphysics]] that underpins the values of Western culture. Hence, he coins the phrase "European nihilism" to describe the condition that afflicts those Enlightenment ideals that seemingly hold strong values yet undermine themselves.

===Ernst Jentsch===
Uncanniness was first explored psychologically by [[Ernst Jentsch]] in a 1906 essay, ''On the Psychology of the Uncanny''. Jentsch defines the ''Uncanny'' as: being a product of "...intellectual uncertainty; so that the uncanny would always, as it were, be something one does not know one’s way about in. The better oriented in his environment a person is, the less readily will he get the impression of something uncanny in regard to the objects and events in it."&lt;ref name="unheimliche" /&gt; He expands upon its use in fiction:

{{quote|In telling a story one of the most successful devices for easily creating uncanny effects is to leave the reader in uncertainty whether a particular figure in the story is a human being or an automaton and to do it in such a way that his attention is not focused directly upon his uncertainty, so that he may not be led to go into the matter and clear it up immediately.&lt;ref name="unheimliche" /&gt;}}

Jentsch identifies German writer [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] as a writer who uses uncanny effects in his work, focusing specifically on Hoffmann's story "The Sandman" ("[[Der Sandmann]]"), which features a lifelike doll, Olympia.

===Sigmund Freud===
The concept of the Uncanny was later elaborated on and developed by [[Sigmund Freud]] in his 1919 essay "The Uncanny", which also draws on the work of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]] (whom Freud refers to as the "unrivalled master of the uncanny in literature"). However, he criticizes Jentsch's belief that Olympia is the central uncanny element in the story ("[[Der Sandmann|The Sandman]]"):

{{quote|I cannot think – and I hope most readers of the story will agree with me – that the theme of the doll Olympia, who is to all appearances a living being, is by any means the only, or indeed the most important, element that must be held responsible for the quite unparalleled atmosphere of uncanniness evoked by the story.&lt;ref name="unheimliche" /&gt;}}

Instead, Freud draws on a wholly different element of the story, namely, "the idea of being robbed of one's eyes", as the "more striking instance of uncanniness" in the tale.

Freud goes on, for the remainder of the essay, to identify uncanny effects that result from instances of "repetition of the same thing," linking the concept to that of the [[repetition compulsion]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Royle, ''The Uncanny'' (2003) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; He includes incidents wherein one becomes lost and accidentally retraces one's steps, and instances wherein random numbers recur, seemingly meaningfully (here Freud may be said to be prefiguring the concept that [[Carl Jung|Jung]] would later refer to as [[synchronicity]]). He also discusses the uncanny nature of [[Otto Rank]]'s concept of the "double".

Freud specifically relates an aspect of the ''Uncanny'' derived from German etymology. By contrasting the German adjective ''unheimlich'' with its base word ''heimlich'' ("concealed, hidden, in secret"), he proposes that social taboo often yields an aura not only of pious reverence but even more so of horror and even disgust, as the taboo state of an item gives rise to the commonplace assumption that that which is hidden from ''public eye'' (cf. the ''eye'' or ''sight'' metaphor) must be a dangerous threat and even an abomination – especially if the concealed item is obviously or presumingly sexual in nature. Basically, the ''Uncanny'' is what unconsciously reminds us of our own ''[[Id, ego, and super-ego|Id]]'', our forbidden and thus [[Psychological repression|repressed impulses]] – especially when placed in a context of uncertainty that can remind one of infantile beliefs in the [[omnipotence]] of thought.&lt;ref name="D. Bate, 2004 p. 39-40"/&gt; Such uncanny elements are perceived as threatening by our ''[[Id, ego, and super-ego|super-ego]]'' ridden with [[Oedipus complex|oedipal guilt]] as it fears [[Castration anxiety|symbolic castration]] by punishment for deviating from societal norms. Thus, the items and individuals that we [[Psychological projection|project]] our own repressed impulses upon become a most ''uncanny'' threat to us, ''uncanny'' monsters and freaks akin to fairy-tale folk-devils, and subsequently often become scapegoats we blame for all sorts of perceived miseries, calamities, and maladies.

{{quote|What interests us most in this long extract is to find that among its different shades of meaning the word ''heimlich'' exhibits one which is identical with its opposite, ''unheimlich''. What is ''heimlich'' thus comes to be ''unheimlich''. [...] In general we are reminded that the word ''heimlich'' is not unambiguous, but belongs to two sets of ideas, which, without being contradictory, are yet very different: on the one hand it means what is familiar and agreeable, and on the other, what is concealed and kept out of sight. ''Unheimlich'' is customarily used, we are told, as the contrary only of the first signification of ''heimlich'', and not of the second. [...] On the other hand, we notice that Schelling says something which throws quite a new light on the concept of the ''Unheimlich'', for which we were certainly not prepared. According to him, everything is ''unheimlich'' that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light.

[...]

A study of dreams, phantasies and myths has taught us that anxiety about one's eyes, the fear of going blind ''[as used as a central theme in "The Sandman"]'', is often enough a substitute for the dread of being castrated. The self-blinding of the mythical criminal, Oedipus, was simply a mitigated form of the punishment of castration – the only punishment that was adequate for him by the ''lex talionis''. [...] All further doubts are removed when we learn the details of their 'castration complex' from the analysis of [[Neurosis#Psychoanalytical account of neurosis|neurotic patients]], and realize its immense importance in their mental life.&lt;ref name="unheimliche" /&gt;}}

After Freud, [[Jacques Lacan]], in his 1962–1963 seminar "L'angoisse" ("Anxiety"), used the Unheimlich "via regia" to enter into the territory of Angst.&lt;ref&gt;A. Vidler, ''The Architectural Uncanny'' (1994) p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan showed how the same image that seduces the subject, trapping him in the narcissistic impasse, may suddenly, by a contingency, show that it is dependent on something, some hidden object, and so the subject may grasp at the same time that he is not autonomous (5 December 1962). For example, and as a paradigm, [[Guy de Maupassant]], in his story "Le Horla", describes a man who suddenly may see his own back in the mirror. His back is there, but it is deprived of the gaze of the subject. It appears as a strange object, until he feels it is his own. There is no cognitive dissonance here, we rather cross all possible cognition, to find ourselves in the field where we do not know how to distinguish bad and good, pleasure from displeasure. And this is the signal of anxiety: the signal of the real, as irreducible to any signifier.

Hitchcock was the master in the art of conducing art into the world of Unheimlich.&lt;ref&gt;N. Royle, ''The Uncanny'' (2003) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  He used simple, everyday objects who may suddenly lose their familiar side, and become the messenger of beyond narcissism.&lt;ref&gt;S. Zizek, ''Looking Awry'' (1992) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related theories==
[[Image:Mori Uncanny Valley.svg|frame|Hypothesized emotional response of human subjects is plotted against anthropomorphism of a robot, following roboticist [[Masahiro Mori (roboticist)|Masahiro Mori]]'s theory of the uncanny. The uncanny valley is the region of negative emotional response towards robots that seem "almost human". Movement amplifies the emotional response.]]

This concept is closely related to [[Julia Kristeva]]'s concept of [[abjection]], where one reacts adversely to something forcefully cast out of the [[symbolic order]]. Abjection can be uncanny in that the observer can recognize something within the abject, possibly of what it was before it was 'cast out', yet be repulsed by what it is that caused it to be cast out to begin with. Kristeva lays special emphasis on the uncanny return of the past abject with relation to the 'uncanny stranger'.&lt;ref&gt;S. Beardsworth, ''Julia Kristeva'' (2012) pp. 189–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadeq Rahimi has noted a common relationship between the uncanny and direct or metaphorical visual references, which he  explains in terms of basic processes of ego development, specifically as developed by Lacan's theory of the [[mirror stage]]. Rahimi presents a wide range of evidence from various contexts to demonstrate how uncanny experiences are typically associated with themes and metaphors of vision, blindness, mirrors and other optical tropes. He also presents historical evidence showing strong presence of ocular and specular themes and associations in the literary and psychological tradition out of which the notion of 'the uncanny' emerged. According to Rahimi, instances of the uncanny like [[doppelgänger]]s, [[ghost]]s, ''[[déjà vu]]'', [[alter ego]]s, self-alienations and split personhoods, phantoms, [[twin]]s, living dolls, etc. share two important features: that they are closely tied with visual tropes, and that they are variations on the theme of doubling of the ego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rahimi |first=S. |date=June 2013 |title=The ego, the ocular, and the uncanny: Why are metaphors of vision central in accounts of the uncanny? |journal=[[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]] |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=453–476 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-8315.2012.00660.x |pmid=23781831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roboticist [[Masahiro Mori (roboticist)|Masahiro Mori]]'s "[[uncanny valley]]" hypothesis (describing human reactions to human-like robots) describes the gap between familiar living people and their also familiar inanimate representations, such as statues or pictures. The things in the valley are between these two poles of common phenomena. The hypothesis is deeply indebted to Jentsch and Freud's observations.

==Etymology==
''Canny'' is from the Anglo-Saxon root ''ken'': "knowledge, understanding, or cognizance; mental perception: ''an idea beyond one's ken''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of ken |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ken |work=[[Dictionary.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the uncanny is something outside one's familiar knowledge or perceptions.

The '''University of Applied Arts Vienna''' ({{lang-de|Universität für angewandte Kunst Wien}}, or informally just ''Die Angewandte'') is an [[Art school|arts university]] and institution of higher education in [[Vienna]], the capital of [[Austria]]. It has had [[university]] status since 1970.

==History==
The predecessor of the ''Angewandte'' was founded in 1863 as the ''k. k. [[Kunstgewerbeschule]]'' ('''Vienna School of Arts and Crafts'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dieangewandte.at/en/university/profile/history|title=History and educational assignment - From the Imperial Royal Arts and Crafts School to the "Angewandte" of Today|website=www.dieangewandte.at/en/university/profile/history|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the example of the South Kensington Museum in London, now the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], to set up a place of advanced education for designers and craftsmen with the Arts and Crafts School in Vienna. It was closely associated with the ''Österreichischen Museums für Kunst und Industrie'' (Imperial Royal Austrian Museum of Art and Industry, today known as the [[Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna|MAK]]). 

It  was the first school of its kind on the continent. In 1941 it became an institution of [[higher education]]. 1941-45 it was called "Reichshochschule fuer angewandte Kunst",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://austria-forum.org/af/AEIOU/Kunstuniversit%C3%A4ten/Kunstuniversit%C3%A4ten_english|title=Kunstuniversitäten (english)|last=http://austria-forum.org/|first=Austria-Forum {{!}}|work=Austria-Forum|access-date=2017-04-18|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1948 was taken over by the [[Austrian state]] as an [[academy]]. In 1970 it was awarded the title of a [[university]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/BgblPdf/1970_54_0/1970_54_0.pdf|title=Federal Law Gazette of the republic Austria (Bundesgesetzblatt der Republik Österreich)|last=|first=|date=1970|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813191008/https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/BgblPdf/1970_54_0/1970_54_0.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-13|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1998 it was renamed the ''Universität für angewandte Künste'' (''University of applied arts'').

Famous artists such as [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Koloman Moser]], [[Vivienne Westwood]], [[Karl Lagerfeld]],Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, [[Jil Sander]], [[Pipilotti Rist]], [[Matteo Thun]], [[François Valentiny]], [[Hugo Markl]] and [[Stefan Sagmeister]] were part of the university's staff or student body. Today its faculty includes many distinguished artists and teachers, such as [[Judith Eisler]], [[Erwin Wurm]], [[Hartmut Esslinger]], [[Greg Lynn]], Wolf D Prix (of [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]), [[Peter Weibel]] and the philosopher [[Burghart Schmidt]].

==Present==
The university has currently ca. 1,800 students and c. 380 faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dieangewandte.at/jart/prj3/angewandte-2016/data/uploads/Universitaet/Berichte/Rechnungsabschluss_Pruefbericht_2015.pdf|title=Final report of accounts of the university, 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students come from 70 different countries to study in the 29 disciplines of the school, structured in 60% Austrians, 25% Europeans and 15% from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uni-ak.ac.at/uqe/download/WB2015.pdf|title=Knowledge balance of the university, data from 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of their processes is made public in ca. 200 exhibitions a year and a multitude of different events and other public presentations.

'''Women in music''' describes the role of women as [[composer]]s, [[songwriter]]s, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], [[singer]]s, [[Conducting|conductors]], [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critic]]s/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements (e.g., [[women's music]], which is music written and performed by women for women), events and genres related to [[Woman|women]], [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women constitute a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and [[classical music]] singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being [[singer-songwriter]]s), there are few women [[record producer]]s, [[music journalist|rock critic]]s and rock instrumentalists. Notable women artists in pop, such as [[Bjork]] and [[Lady Gaga]] have commented about [[sexism]] and [[gender discrimination]] in the [[music industry]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-world-needs-female-rock-critics|title=The World Needs Female Rock Critics|first=Anwen|last=Crawford|date=26 May 2015|accessdate=7 April 2018|website=Newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite web|first = Karen |last = Mizoguchi|title = Lady Gaga Calls Music Industry a 'F---king Boys Club' |work = People|date = 12 December 2015|url =  http://www.people.com/article/lady-gaga-music-industry-boys-club-billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, a recent study led by Dr. Smith announced that "...over the last six years, the representation of women in the music industry has been even lower".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/arts/music/music-industry-gender-study-women-artists-producers.html|title=Gender Diversity in the Music Industry?

Women constitute a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s.

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap|title=CBC Music|website=music.cbc.ca|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|conductor of an orchestra]],&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jessica|last=Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; a profession which has been called "one of the last [[glass ceiling]]s in the [[music industry]]".&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt;  In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[music producer]]s, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; One of the most recorded artists is a woman, [[Asha Bhosle]], an Indian singer who is best known as a [[playback singer]] in Hindi cinema.&lt;ref name="indiatoday.intoday.in"/&gt;

==Songwriters==

A songwriter is an individual who writes the [[lyrics]], [[melody|melodies]] and [[chord progression]]s for songs, typically for a [[popular music]] genre such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]] or [[country music]]. A songwriter can also be called a [[composer]], although the latter term tends to be mainly used for individuals from the classical music genre.

===19th century-early 20th century===
"Only a few of the many women [songwriters] in America had their music published and heard during the late 19th and early 20th centuries."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; According to Richard A. Reublin and Richard G. Beil, the "lack of mention of women [songwriters] is a glaring and embarrassing omission in our musical heritage."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Women "struggled to write and publish music in the man's world of 20th century [[Tin Pan Alley]]. Prior to 1900 and even after, it was expected that "women would perform music, not make music."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; In 1880, Chicago music critic George P. Upton wrote the book ''Women In Music'', in which he argued that "women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to the "biological predisposition" of women.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; As part of women's role in music education, women wrote hymns and children's music. The "secular music in print in America before 1825 shows only about 70 works by women." In the mid 19th century, notable women songwriters emerged, including [[Faustina Hasse Hodges]], Susan Parkhurst, [[Augusta Browne]] and [[Marion Dix Sullivan]]. By 1900, there were many more women songwriters, but "many were still forced to use pseudonyms or initials" to hide the fact that they were women.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt;

[[Carrie Jacobs-Bond]] was the "preeminent woman composer of the late 1800's and well into the middle of the twentieth century... [making her] the first million selling woman" songwriter.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Maude Nugent (1877–1958) wrote "Sweet Rosie O'Grady" in 1896. She also penned "Down At Rosie Reilly's Flat", "My Irish Daisy" and "Mary From Tipperary".&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Charlotte Blake (1885–1979) was a staff writer for at the Whitney Warner Publishing Co., in Detroit, Michigan. Initially, the company billed her as "C. Blake" to hide her gender, but by 1906 ads used her full name.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; [[Caro Roma]] (1866–1937) was the gender-ambiguous pseudonym for [[Carrie Northly]]. She was "one of America's more well known and popular composers of the Tin Pan Alley era." Her songs include "Can't Yo' Heah Me Calling", "Faded Rose", "The Angelus", "Thinking of Thee" and "Resignation".&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; About 95% of the songwriters in British [[music hall]] during the early 1900s were men; however, about 30% of the singers were women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John Mullen.

While [[jazz]] songwriting has long been a male-dominated field, there have been a few notable [[Women in Jazz|women jazz songwriters]]. In the 1930s, [[Ann Ronell]] (1905–1993) wrote several hit songs.

===New wave of female singer-songwriters===
By the late 1960s a new wave of female singer-songwriters broke from the confines of pop, using the urban landscape as their canvass for lyrics in the confessional style of poets like Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath.  These pioneering women, appeared in a feature in [[Newsweek]], July, 1969, "The Girls: Letting Go": "What is common to them – to [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Lotti Golden]], to [[Laura Nyro]], [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], [[Janis Ian]] and to Elyse Weinberg, are the personalised songs they write, like voyages of self-discovery. [[Grace Slick]] a former model, was widely known in rock and roll history for her role in San Francisco's burgeoning psychedelic music scene in the mid–1960s." In ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 January 2017, author Laura Barton describes the radical shift in subject matter — politics, drugs, disappointment, the isolation of the itinerant performer, and urban life.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/26/from-joni-mitchell-to-laura-marling-how-female-troubadours-changed-music|title=From Joni Mitchell to Laura Marling: how female troubadours changed music|first=Laura|last=Barton|date=26 January 2017|website=the Guardian|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native New Yorker, [[Lotti Golden]], in her Atlantic debut album ''[[Motor-Cycle (album)|Motor-Cycle]]'', chronicled her life in NYC's East Village in the late '60s counterculture, visiting subjects such as gender identity (The Space Queens-Silky is Sad) and excessive drug use (Gonna Fay's). The women in the 1969 Newsweek article ushered in a new age of the singer-songwriter, informing generations of women singer-songwriters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=2664&amp;from=search |via= JoniMitchell.com Library|title= THE GIRLS—LETTING GO|work= Newsweek|date= 14 July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Musical theatre===
In [[musical theatre]], "female songwriters are rare in an industry dominated by males on the creative end.

===Black women===
According to [[LaShonda Katrice Barnett]], a college and university teacher and author of a book on black women songwriters, of the "over 380 members of the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]], just 2 are black women ([[Sylvia Moy]] and [[Valerie Simpson]])". Barnett asks "[w]hy are there so few prominent black women songwriters?"&lt;ref name="songfacts.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/writing/black_women_songwriters/ |title=Black Women Songwriters |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnett states that two important black women songwriters are [[Abbey Lincoln]], a rare example of a jazz singer who wrote her own albums and [[Cassandra Wilson]], who records both her own songs and "covers" of famous artists.&lt;ref name="songfacts.com"/&gt;

==Composers==
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|right|upright|220px|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]]]]
{{See also|List of female composers by birth date}}
American musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard  'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"/&gt;

According to Abbey Philips, "women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve".&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Abbey|last = Philips |url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992 |title=Spacebomb: Truth lies somewhere in between |publisher=Rvanews.com |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Medieval eras, most of the art music was created for liturgical (religious) purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders, few women composed this type of music, with the nun [[Hildegard von Bingen]] being among the exceptions. Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers. As well, very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. In the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is the only woman composer who is mentioned.&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"/&gt; Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts".&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"/&gt;

===Medieval era===
{{Listen|filename=O frondens 2.ogg|title=''O frondens virga''|description=From ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]''|format=[[Ogg]]}}
[[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098–1179) was a German [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]], composer, writer, philosopher, and [[visionary]].&lt;ref name="Bennett, Judith M 2001"&gt;Bennett, Judith M. and Hollister, Warren C. ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2001), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; One of her works as a composer, the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'', is an early example of liturgical drama and an early [[morality play]].  Some writers have speculated a distant origin for opera in this piece, though without any evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/opera.html alt Opera, see Florentine Camerata in the province of Milan, Italy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kitbraz.com/gen/rev/1998nytmirapaulHild.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive. This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers. Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum.'' The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Her music is described as [[monophony|monophonic]], using soaring melodies that pushed the boundaries of the more traditional [[Gregorian chant]].

===Renaissance era===
[[Maddalena Casulana]] (1544–1590) was an Italian composer, [[lute]]nist and singer.&lt;ref&gt;Alternative names: Madalena Casulana di Mezarii, Madalena Casula.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first work dates from 1566: four madrigals in a collection, ''Il Desiderio'', which she produced in [[Florence]]. Two years later she published in [[Venice]] her first book of madrigals for four voices, ''Il primo libro di madrigali'', which is the first printed, published work by a woman in Western music history.&lt;ref name="Bridges"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000005155|title=Casulana [Mezari], Maddalena - Grove Music|website=Oxfordmusicinline.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was close to [[Isabella de' Medici]] and dedicated some of her music to her. In 1570, 1583 and 1586 she published other books of madrigals. In the dedication to her first book of madrigals, she shows her feelings about being a female composer at a time when this was rare: "[I] want to show the world, as much as I can in this profession of music, the vain error of men that they alone possess the gifts of intellect and artistry, and that such gifts are never given to women." 
Her style is [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] and [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] and her melodic lines are singable and attentive to the text. Other composers of the time, such as [[Philippe de Monte]], thought highly of her.

[[Caterina Assandra]] (1590–1618) was an Italian composer and [[Benedictine]] [[nun]]. She became famous as an organist and published various works.&lt;ref&gt;''Women Composers: Music Through the Ages.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/midi/mid/assand2.mid# |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165459/http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/midi/mid/assand2.mid# |archive-date=3 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assandra composed a number of [[motet]]s and organ pieces. She studied [[counterpoint]] with Benedetto Re, one of the leading teachers at [[Pavia Cathedral]]. She composed a collection of [[motet]]s in the new [[concertato]] style in [[Milan]] in 1609, an imitative eight-voice ''[[Salve Regina]]'' in 1611, and a [[motet]], ''Audite verbum Dominum,'' for four voices in 1618. She composed traditional pieces and more innovative works. Among the latter is ''Duo seraphim.'' Her motet ''O Salutaris hodie,'' included in ''Motetti'' op. 2, was one of the first pieces to include the [[violone]], a bowed stringed instrument.

[[Francesca Caccini]] (1587–1641) was an Italian composer, singer, [[lute]]nist, poet, and music teacher. Her singing for the wedding of [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Maria de Medici]] in 1600 was praised by Henry, who called her the "best singer in all of France". She worked in the [[Medici]] court as a teacher, chamber singer, rehearsal coach and composer of both chamber and stage music until 1627. By 1614 she was the court's most highly paid musician, because her musical [[virtuosity]] so well exemplified an idea of female excellence projected by Tuscany's de facto Regent, Granduchess [[Christina of Lorraine]]. Most of her stage music was composed for performance in comedies. In 1618 she published a collection of thirty-six solo songs and soprano/bass duets. In 1625 she composed a 75-minute "comedy-ballet". In all, she wrote sixteen staged works. She was a master of dramatic harmonic surprise: in her music it is harmony changes, more than counterpoint, that most powerfully communicates emotional affect.

[[Barbara Strozzi]] (1619–1677) was an Italian [[Baroque]] composer and singer. As a child, her considerable vocal talents were displayed to a wide audience. She was also compositionally gifted, and her father arranged for her to study with composer [[Francesco Cavalli]]. Strozzi was said to be "the most prolific composer – man or woman – of printed secular vocal music in Venice in the Middle of the century".{{sfn|Glixon|1999|p=135}} Her output is also unique in that it only contains secular vocal music, with the exception of one volume of sacred songs.{{sfn|Heller|2006}} She was renowned for her poetic ability as well as her compositional talent. Her lyrics were often poetic and well-articulated.{{sfn|Glixon|1999|p=138}} Nearly three-quarters of her printed works were written for [[soprano]], but she also published works for other voices.{{sfn|Kendrick|2002}} Her compositions are firmly rooted in the ''[[seconda pratica]]'' tradition. Strozzi's music evokes the spirit of [[Francesco Cavalli|Cavalli]], heir of [[Monteverdi]].  However, her style is more lyrical, and more dependent on sheer vocal sound.{{sfn|Rosand|1986|p=170}} Many of the texts for her early pieces were written by her father Giulio. Later texts were written by her father's colleagues, and for many compositions she may have written her own texts.

[[Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre]] (1665–1729) was a French composer, musician and [[harpsichordist]]. She was born into a family of musicians and master instrument-makers. A child prodigy, she performed on the [[harpsichord]] before King [[Louis XIV]]. She became a musician in the Royal Court and taught, composed, and gave concerts at home and throughout Paris, to great acclaim.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;[[Catherine Cessac]].

[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/14084].&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the few well-known female composers of her time, and unlike many of her contemporaries, she composed in a wide variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Cyr. "Elisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre: Myth or Marvel? Seeking the Composer's Individuality." The Musical Times. Vol. 149, No. 1905 (Winter, 2008), pp. 79–87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her talent and achievements were acknowledged by [[Titon du Tillet]], who accorded her a place on his ''Mount Parnassus'' when she was only 26 years old, next to Lalande and Marais and directly below Lully. Her works include a ballet, an opera (''[[Céphale et Procris (Jacquet de la Guerre)|Céphale et Procris]]''), [[trio sonata]]s, harpsichord pieces, ''Sonates pour le viollon et pour le clavecin'' and vocal works such as her ''[[Cantates]] françoises sur des sujets tirez de l'Ecriture''.

[[Harriett Abrams]] (1758–1821) was an English composer and [[soprano]]. As a singer, she was praised for her performances of [[George Frideric Handel]]. She studied singing, [[music theory]], and [[Musical composition|composition]] with composer [[Thomas Arne]] before making her opera début in 1775 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London. Abrams became a principal singer at the fashionable London concerts and provincial festivals, appearing regularly from 1780–1790. Abrams composed several songs, two of which, "The Orphan's Prayer" and "Crazy Jane", became popular. She published two sets of Italian and English [[canzonet]]s, a collection of Scottish songs and glees harmonized for two and three voices, and more than a dozen songs, mainly sentimental [[ballad]]s. A collection of songs published in 1803 was dedicated by Harriett to [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]].&lt;ref name="Grove1"&gt;Olive Baldwin, Thelma Wilson: "Harriett Abrams", ''Grove Music Online'' ed.

[[Maria Teresa Agnesi]] (1720–1795) was an Italian composer.  Though she was most famous for her compositions, she was also an accomplished [[harpsichordist]] and singer. The majority of her surviving compositions were written for keyboard, the voice, or both. Her career was made possible by the Austrian Lombardy, which was progressive and enlightened in [[women's rights]]. Her patron was [[Maria Theresia]], holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Lombardy, and [[Maria Antonia Walpurgis]], a gifted composer and contemporary. Her early works are simple and clean, while her later works are more virtuosic, complex, and melodramatic. She composed operas, including heroic drama and serious drama styles. She also wrote arias, concertos and sonatas for keyboard, small ensemble and voice.

[[Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia|Princess Anna Amalia]] (1723–1787) was a Prussian composer and score curator. She learned to play the harpsichord, flute, and violin as a young woman.

As a composer she achieved a modest amount of fame and is most known for her smaller chamber works, which included trios, marches, cantatas, songs and fugues. In 1758, she studied musical theory and composition with [[Johann Kirnberger|Johann Philipp Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. She composed chamber music such as flute sonatas. More, she set the text of Ramler's [[Passion cantata]] ''Der Tod Jesu'' ("The Death of Jesus") to music. She was also a collector of music, preserving over 600 volumes of works by Johann Sebastian Bach, [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Karl Heinrich Graun]] and [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], among others. Her works of [[curator|curation]] are a significant contribution to [[Western culture]].

[[Elisabeth Olin]] (1740–1828) was a Swedish opera singer and composer. She debuted as Alfhild in ''Syrinx'' referred to as Sweden's first native [[Opéra comique|Opera comique]], at ''[[Bollhuset]]'' in 1747. She became a famed vocalist in the regular public concerts at ''[[Riddarhuset]]'' in [[Stockholm]], and published her own compositions; she was one of the Swedish composers who wrote one composition each for the collection ''Gustaviade. En hjältedikt i tolv sånger'' ('Gustaviade.

[[Marianne von Martinez]] (1744–1812) was an Austrian composer, singer and pianist. [[Metastasio]] noticed her precocious talents and came to oversee her musical education, which included keyboard lessons from [[Haydn]], singing lessons with [[Porpora]] and composition lessons with [[Johann Adolph Hasse]] and the Imperial court composer [[Giuseppe Bonno]]. She was a native speaker of both Italian and German and knew French and English.&lt;ref&gt;Godt, 541&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, she played for the Imperial court, where she "attracted attention with her beautiful voice and her keyboard playing".&lt;ref&gt;Wessely, [[New Grove]], "Marianne von Martinez", online edition cited below&lt;/ref&gt; As an adult, she was frequently asked to perform before the Empress [[Maria Theresa]].&lt;ref&gt;Godt 1995, 538&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the works that Marianna composed are set for solo voice. She wrote a number of secular cantatas and two oratorios to Italian texts. Surviving compositions include four [[mass]]es, six [[motet]]s, and three litanies for choir. She wrote in the Italian style, as was typical for the early [[classical music era|Classical]] period in Vienna.  Her harpsichord performance practice was compared to the style of [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E. Bach]]. Her Italian oratorio ''Isacco figura del redentore'' was premiered by massive forces in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl (1856:60)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fanny Hensel 1842.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Mendelssohn, 1842, by [[Moritz Daniel Oppenheim]]]]

[[Maria Szymanowska]] (1789–1831) was a well-known Polish composer and pianist. She wrote in many of the same genres as fellow Pole [[Frederic Chopin]] (1810–1849). Szymanowska maintained connections with several famous nineteenth-century people, including [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and [[Adam Mickiewicz]], Poland's greatest poet.

[[Fanny Mendelssohn]] (1805–1847) was one of the best-known women composers of the 1800s. She showed prodigious musical ability as a child and began to write music. Even though famous visitors to her family home were equally impressed by Fanny and her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], Fanny was limited by prevailing attitudes of the time toward women. Her father was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. Her father wrote to her in 1820, telling her that "[m]usic will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament [in your life]".&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I 82&lt;/ref&gt; Felix cautioned her against publishing her works under her own name and seeking a career in music. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for [musical] authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it'.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113
&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Clara Schumann]] (1819–1896) was a German composer and concert pianist who had a 61-year concert career, which changed the format and repertoire of the piano recital and the tastes of the listening public. From an early age, she had a one-hour lesson in piano, violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint. In 1830, at the age of eleven, she had become a virtuoso soloist and she left on a concert tour of European cities. In the late 1830s, she performed to sell-out crowds and laudatory critical reviews. [[Frédéric Chopin]] described her playing to [[Franz Liszt]], who came to hear one of her concerts and subsequently "praised her extravagantly" in a letter that was published in the Parisian ''Revue et Gazette Musicale''.&lt;ref name="Nancya250"&gt;Reich (1986), 250.&lt;/ref&gt; She was named a ''Königliche und Kaiserliche Kammervirtuosin'' ("Royal and Imperial Chamber Virtuoso"), [[Austria]]'s highest musical honor.&lt;ref name="Nancya250" /&gt;

She was also instrumental in changing the kind of programs expected of concert pianists. In her early career, before her marriage to [[Robert Schumann]], she played what was then customary, mainly bravura pieces designed to showcase the artist's technique, often in the form of arrangements or variations on popular themes from operas, written by virtuosos such as Thalberg, Herz, or Henselt. As it was also customary to play one's own compositions, she included at least one of her own works in every program, works such as her Variations on a Theme by Bellini (Op. 8) and her popular Scherzo (Op. 10). Her works include songs, piano pieces, a piano concerto, a [[piano trio]], choral pieces, and three Romances for violin and piano. &lt;!--Her husband however remarked that she did not have the opportunity to do this often, as a result of being a wife and a mother:

{{quote|'Clara has composed a series of small pieces, which show a musical and tender ingenuity such as she has never attained before. But to have children, and a husband who is always living in the realm of imagination, does not go together with composing. She cannot work at it regularly, and I am often disturbed to think how many profound ideas are lost because she cannot work them out'.}}{{cn|date=February 2018}}--&gt;

====Individuals and bandleaders====
[[File:Suzi Quatro plays a bass guitar while she sings at AIS Arena.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Suzi Quatro]] is a singer, bassist and bandleader. When she launched her career in 1973, she was one of the few prominent women instrumentalists and bandleaders.]]

Women have a high prominence in many [[popular music]] styles as singers. However, professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in popular music, especially in rock genres such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. "[P]laying in a band is largely a male homosocial activity, that is, learning to play in a band is largely a peer-based... experience, shaped by existing sex-segregated friendship networks.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 101-102&lt;/ref&gt; As well, rock music "is often defined as a form of male rebellion vis-à-vis female bedroom culture."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 102"&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, there has been a gendered "distinction between public (male) and private (female) participation" in music.&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 102"/&gt; "[S]everal scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands' rehearsals, recordings, performances, and other social activities."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; "Women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick, prefabricated – hence, inferior – pop music..., excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"/&gt; One of the reasons that there are rarely mixed gender bands is that "bands operate as tight-knit units in which homosocial solidarity – social bonds between people of the same sex... – plays a crucial role."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"/&gt; In the 1960s pop music scene, "[s]inging was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument...simply wasn't done."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"/&gt;

"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women—often, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teens—in rock usually sang songs as personæ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends...". Philip Auslander says that "Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music". Though some women played instruments in American [[all-female bands|all-female garage rock bands]], none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they "did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock".&lt;ref name="I Wanna Be Your Man"&gt;{{cite journal

====All-female bands and girl groups====
An [[all-female band]] is a musical group in [[popular music]] genres such as rock, [[blues]], [[jazz]] and related genres which is exclusively composed of [[female musician]]s. This is distinct from a [[girl group]], in which the female members are solely vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed.&lt;ref&gt;For example, vocalists [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as a "girl band" in [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud ''OK'' magazine] and the [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor ''Guardian''], while [[Girlschool]] are termed a "girl group" at the [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio ''imdb''] and [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 ''Belfast Telegraph''].&lt;/ref&gt; While all-male bands are common in many rock and pop bands, all-female bands are less common.

A [[girl group]] is a music act featuring several female singers who generally [[vocal harmony|harmonize]] together. The term "girl group" is also used in a narrower sense within English-speaking countries to denote the wave of American female [[pop music]] singing groups which flourished in the late [[1950s in music|1950s]] and early [[1960s in music|1960s]] between the [[Rock and roll#decline|decline of early rock and roll]] and the [[British Invasion]], many of whom were influenced by [[doo-wop]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutledge |first=Meredith E. |url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6655_the-fabulous-girl-groups-women-who-rock/ |title=The Fabulous Girl Groups &amp;#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/g_g-history.htm |title=Girl Groups - A Short History |publisher=History-of-rock.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; All-female bands are sometimes also called girl groups.&lt;ref&gt;For example, vocalist groups [[Sugababes]] and [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as "girl bands" [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud Meet the duo dressing Girls Aloud] ''OK'' magazine, 20 March 2009; [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor The nation's new sweetheart] ''The Observer'', 9 November 2008; while instrumentalists [[Girlschool]] are termed a "[[girl group]]" [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio Biography for Girlschool] Internet Movie Database; [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 The Hedrons] ''Belfast Telegraph'', 19 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930s-1960s====
In the [[Jazz Age]] and during the 1930s, all-female bands such as The Blue Belles, the Parisian Redheads (later the Bricktops), Lil-Hardin's All-Girl Band, [[The Ingenues]], The Harlem Playgirls, Phil Spitalny's Musical Sweethearts and "Helen Lewis and Her All-Girl Jazz Syncopators" were popular.[[Ina Ray Hutton]] led an all-girl band, the [[Melodears]], from 1934 to 1939.  Eunice Westmoreland, under the name [[Rita Rio]], led an all-female band appearing on [[NBC Radio]] and for [[Vitaphone]] and [[RKO]]. A Polish group [[Filipinki]] was established in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://szczecin.gazeta.pl/szczecin/1,34959,14873014,Filipinki__W_USA_przecieraly_szlaki__w_ZSRR_czerwone.html?as=2 |title=Wyborcza.pl |publisher=Szczecin.gazeta.pl |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2016-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217153333/http://szczecin.gazeta.pl/szczecin/1,34959,14873014,Filipinki__W_USA_przecieraly_szlaki__w_ZSRR_czerwone.html?as=2# |archive-date=17 December 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups composed solely of women began to emerge with the advent of [[rock and roll]]. Among the earliest all-female rock bands to be signed to a record label were [[Goldie &amp; the Gingerbreads]], to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1964, [[The Pleasure Seekers/Cradle|The Pleasure Seekers]] with [[Suzi Quatro]] to Hideout Records in 1964 and [[Mercury Records]] in 1968, [[The Feminine Complex]] to Athena Records in 1968, and [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] (who pioneered the all-female band sound in the early to mid-1970s) in 1969 when [[Mo Ostin]] signed them to [[Warner Bros. Records]].  There were also others, such as [[The Liverbirds]] (1962–1967), [[the Ace of Cups]] (1967), [[The Heart Beats]] (1968), and Ariel (1968–1970).

====1970s-1980s====
In 1971 [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] became the first all-female band to reach the Hot 100's top 40, with "Charity Ball" peaking at No. 40. In 1975, the Canadian duo of sisters, [[Kate and Anna McGarrigle]], recorded the first of a string of albums. [[The Runaways]] were an early commercially successful, hard-edged, all-female hard rock band, releasing their first album in 1976: band members [[Joan Jett]], [[Cherie Currie]] and [[Lita Ford]] all went on to solo careers. The 1980s, for the first time, saw long-sought chart success from all-female bands and female-fronted rock bands.  On the Billboard Hot 100-year-end chart for 1982&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1982 "The Billboard Hot 100 1982"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Retrieved 30 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Jett]]'s ''[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]'' at No. 3 and [[the Go-Go's]] ''[[We Got the Beat]]'' at No. 25 sent a message out to many industry heads that females who could play could bring in money.

[[File:Viv Albertine.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Punk guitarist [[Viv Albertine]].]]
In the United Kingdom, the advent of [[Punk rock|punk]] in the late 1970s with its "anyone can do it" ethos led to women making significant contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coon|first1=Caroline|title=1988: The New Wave Punk Rock Explosion|date=1977|publisher=Omnibus/Hawthorne Books|location=London|isbn=978-0801561290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Judy|title=15 Essential Women Punk Rock Icons|url=http://flavorwire.com/199630/15-essential-women-punk-icons|website=Flavorwire|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[rock music]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] scenes of the 1970s, which were dominated by men, the anarchic, counter-cultural mindset of the punk scene in mid- and late 1970s encouraged women to participate. "That was the beauty of the punk thing," [[Chrissie Hynde]] later said." [Sexual] discrimination didn't exist in that scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women of Punk and Post-Punk Music|url=http://www.biography.com/people/groups/women-of-punk-and-post-punk-music|website=Biography.com|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This participation played a role in the historical development of punk music, especially in the U.S. and U.K. at that time, and continues to influence and enable future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Women in Punk?|url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/whywomeninpunk.htm|website=Women in Punk|publisher=Punk77.co.uk|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock historian Helen Reddington states that the popular image of young punk women musicians as focused on the fashion aspects of the scene (fishnet stockings, spiky blond hair, etc.) was stereotypical. She states that many, if not most women punks were more interested in the ideology and socio-political implications, rather than the fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reddington|first1=Helen|title=The Lost Women of Rock Music: Female Musicians of the Punk Era|date=2012|publisher=Ashgate/Equinox Publishing|isbn=978-1845539573|url=http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calcTitle=1&amp;isbn=9780754657736&amp;lang=cy-GB|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woronzoff|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Lost Women of Rock Music' Is an Important Work, But a Replay of the Same Old Themes|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/161962-the-lost-women-of-rock-music...-by-helen-reddington/|website=Pop Matters|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music historian Caroline Coon contends that before punk, women in rock music were virtually invisible; in contrast, in punk, she argues "[i]t would be possible to write the whole history of punk music without mentioning any male bands at all -- and I think a lot of [people] would find that very surprising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conference proceedings (September 2001)|title=No Future?|accessdate=26 November 2015|publisher=University of Wolverhampton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reddington|first1=Helen|title=Introduction: The Lost Women of Rock Music|date=1977|publisher=Ashgate|location=London|isbn=9780754657736|url=http://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Lost_Women_of_Rock_Music_Intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Rotten]] wrote that "During the Pistols era, women were out there playing with the men, taking us on in equal terms ...

Others take issue with the notion of equal recognition, such as guitarist [[Viv Albertine]], who stated that "the A&amp;R men, the bouncers, the sound mixers, no one took us seriously.. So, no, we got no respect anywhere we went.

The all-female [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Girlschool]], from South London, formed in 1978 out of the ashes of Painted Lady. While somewhat successful in the UK, they became better known in the early 1980s. One of the original members of the band, [[Kathy Valentine]] departed to join the all-female band [[The Go-Go's]], switching from guitar to bass. Among Girlschool's early recordings was an EP titled "The St. Valentines Day Massacre" which they recorded with Bronze label-mates [[Motörhead]] under the name [[Headgirl]]. In 1974, The Deadly Nightshade, a rock/country band, was signed by Phantom. Women in the heavy metal genre tend to have to limit themselves due to the genre being very male orientated.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, R.L. (2016).

=====Grunge=====
While there is a perception that the groups in the 1980s and 1990s [[alternative rock]] genre of [[grunge]] were "overwhelmingly male" (e.g., [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]), "[w]omen were totally represented" in grunge bands such as [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[Lunachicks]], [[Dickless]], STP, [[7 Year Bitch]], [[Courtney Love]]'s group [[Hole (band)|Hole]] and [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]], the latter an "[[All female band|all-female Minneapolis band]]", and grunge was "inextricably linked with [[Riot Grrrl]]", an underground [[feminist]] [[punk rock|punk]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/24/grunge-myths-nirvana-kurt-cobain|title=Ten myths about grunge, Nirvana and Kurt Cobain |last=True |first=Everett |date= 24 August 2011|publisher=The Guardian |access-date=29 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable women instrumentalists include the bassists [[D'arcy Wretzky]] and [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] from [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] and drummers [[Patty Schemel]] ([[Hole (band)|Hole]] and Courtney Love projects) and [[Lori Barbero]] of [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://90srock.about.com/od/top-picks/tp/The-Greatest-Drummers-of-the-90s.htm|title=The 10 Greatest Drummers of the '90s|website=90srockmusic.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990s-2000s====
In the 1990s, musician's magazines were starting to view female musicians more seriously, putting [[Bonnie Raitt]]&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Raitt cover story, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', May 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Raitt cover story, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', July 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tina Weymouth]]&lt;ref&gt;"Tina Weymouth &amp; David Byrne, The Talking Heads" (cover story), ''Guitar Player Magazine'', March 1984&lt;/ref&gt; on their covers. While The Go-Go's and [[The Bangles]], both from the LA club scene, were the first all-female rock bands to find sustained success, individual musicians paved the way for the industry to seek out bands that had female musicians.

In the 1990s, bands such as [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[Super Heroines]], The Lovedolls and [[L7 (band)|L7]] became popular, while demonstrating on stage, and in interviews, a self-confident and  "bad" attitude at times, always willing to challenge assumptions about how an all-female band should behave. [[Courtney Love]] described the other females in [[Hole (band)|Hole]] as using a more "lunar viewpoint" in their roles as musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Boder, Christopher. "The Hole Story", ''Buzz'', Page 13, Vol VII, Issue 70. October 1991. "Most women in rock are only repeating what men have done. The women in this band are not doing that. We're coming at things from a more feminine, lunar, viewpoint."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the punk, female-led [[Riot Grrrl]] genre was associated with bands such as [[Bratmobile]] and [[Bikini Kill]].

====2000s-2010s====
In the 2000s, all female and female fronted bands started using their influence to promote feminism and females in the music industry. Bands like The Distillers, fronted by Brody Dalle, influenced the rise of street punk. St. Vincent started gaining more traction and eventually appeared on the cover of Guitar World magazine. St. Vincent wore a T-shirt with a bikini decal on the magazine cover, a comment on how when women appear with guitars, they're usually dressed very minimally, as a marketing tool to sell the instruments. Haim, a band composed of three sisters, is extremely outspoken when it comes to the promotion of women in music, calling out major music festivals for the lack of female-fronted bands on bills and the lack of payment for female artists as compared to male artists of the same level.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/06/13/haim-festival-inequality/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/oct/12/tonights-live-music-acts-will-mostly-be-male-only-whats-holding-women-back&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the lack of female representation in music has been a major controversial point in the industry. Female musicians and bands are constantly overlooked in favor of male artists, however many people in the music industry have been making an effort to change this.

===Jazz===

Historically, the majority of well-known [[Women in jazz|women performers in jazz]] have been singers, such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Diane Schuur]] and [[Dinah Washington]]. ''Culture Trip'' notes that women in jazz have been "too often confined to the role of chanteuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rasch|first1=Mirac|title=The Top 10 Female Jazz Musicians You Should Know|url=https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/the-top-10-female-jazz-musicians-you-should-know/|accessdate=3 April 2016|publisher=Culture Trip|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many notable instrumental performers. In some cases, these musicians are also composers and bandleaders:
* [[Toshiko Akiyoshi]] (b. 1929): bandleader, pianist, arranger, composer
* [[Regina Carter]]: [[jazz violin]]
* [[Melba Liston]]: trombonist and arranger
* [[Vi Redd]] (b. 1928): alto saxophonist 
* [[Melissa Aldana]]: tenor saxophonist

There have also been [[all-female band|all-female jazz bands]] such as [[The International Sweethearts of Rhythm]].

Instrumentalists in classical music may focus on one specific type of playing, such as solo recitals, solo concertos, [[chamber music]], or performing as a member of an orchestra, or they may do different types. Some musicians who play orchestral instruments may do all of these types of performances. Instrumentalists in classical music may do both live performances for an audience and recordings. In some cases, classical performers may do mostly live performances. There has traditionally been a gendered aspect to playing instruments in classical music.

Many album covers for female classical musicians have photographs that emphasize the physical attractiveness of the performer, "often using risqué images".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan. ''Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World'', Volume 1. SAGE Publications, 2011. p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', Classical women musicians are "too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt;

====Orchestra====
[[File:Music. Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra BAnQ Vieux-Montréal P48S1P08057.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra in 1942]]
Historically, orchestras tended to be almost exclusively male, with the exception of the harp player, as the harp was considered a "women's instrument". A music newspaper editorial in 1917 in England encouraged orchestras to allow women to play the "lighter instruments", with the understanding that these women performers would relinquish their positions to men once WW I was over.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the 1990s, to reduce the likelihood of [[gender bias]], some orchestras began conducting [[audition]]s of potential new members behind a screen, so the audition panel could not see if it was a male or female performer. Historically, there has been a tendency for brass sections to be male, and some women brass players have alleged that there is gender bias against female brass players. A study in the 1980s found that women made up 36% of US orchestras; 30% in the United Kingdom, and 16% in East and West Germany.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/excuse.htm |title=Gender Bias In International Orchestras |publisher=Osborne-conant.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women tended to be hired by lower paid orchestras and they were less present in major orchestras.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt;

In the past, the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]] argued that "ethnic and gender uniformity" gave their orchestra a better sound.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt; Several male VPO musicians stated in a 1996 interview that classical music has "gender-defined qualities which can be most clearly expressed by male uniformity" in the orchestra.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt; One male VPO member stated that men "carry secrets that are involved with music and tones, just like in Australian aboriginal or Indian cultures where men play certain instruments, and not the women."&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt; One male VPO performer stated that "pregnancy brings problems.  It brings disorder.  Another important argument against women is that they can bring the solidarity of the men in question. You find that in all men's groups."

The Vienna Philharmonic did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (of the other orchestras ranked among the world's top five by [[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] in 2008,&lt;ref name="The world's greatest orchestras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the last to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James R. Oestreich]], [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/berlin-in-lights-the-woman-question/ "Berlin in Lights: The Woman Question"], Arts Beat, ''The New York Times'', 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) As late as February 1996, first flautist Dieter Flury told [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] that accepting women would be "gambling with the emotional unity ({{Lang|de|emotionelle Geschlossenheit}}) that this organism currently has".&lt;ref name=WDR5&gt;Westdeutscher Rundfunk Radio 5, "Musikalische Misogynie", 13 February 1996, [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdrgerm.htm transcribed by Regina Himmelbauer]; [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdr.htm translation by William Osborne]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996, the orchestra's press secretary wrote that "compensating for the expected leaves of absence" of [[maternity leave]] was a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/schuster.htm |title=The Vienna Philharmonic's Letter of Response to the Gen-Mus List |work=Osborne-conant.org |date=25 February 1996 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sarah Chang before performing.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Classical violinist [[Sarah Chang]] before performing a 2005 solo concert]]

In 1997, the orchestra was "facing protests during a [US] tour" by the [[National Organization for Women]] and International Association of Women in Music. Finally, "after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist."&lt;ref name=JP&gt;Jane Perlez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/world/vienna-philharmonic-lets-women-join-in-harmony.html "Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra's [[concertmaster]]s in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-appoints-first-ever-female-concertmaster-opera-austria |title = Vienna opera appoints first ever female concertmaster|work = [[France 24]]|date = 8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the orchestra's membership, compared to 14% in the Berlin Philharmonic, 30% in the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], and 36% in the [[New York Philharmonic]]. VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened [[blind audition]]s. She said it chooses "the best we get," implying that full gender equity would take time as older members retire and new ones audition under gender-neutral conditions.&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;James R. Oestrich, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/28/arts/even-legends-adjust-to-time-and-trend-even-the-vienna.html "Even Legends Adjust To Time and Trend, Even the Vienna Philharmonic"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Czech Philharmonic]] excludes women and the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] "has a history of gender discrimination."&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt;

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists. Brass, percussion, and [[Double bass|string-bass]] orchestra sections are still predominantly male."&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Hannah|last=Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soloists====
In classical music, soloists may perform unaccompanied solos on their instrument, as occurs with pianists who play works for solo piano or stringed instruments who play Baroque suites for one instrument (e.g., [[Bach suites for solo cello]]). In many cases, though, soloists are accompanied, either by a pianist, a small [[chamber music]] ensemble, or, in the case of a concerto, by a full symphony orchestra. In the 2014–2015 season, the majority of concerto soloists who performed with major Canadian orchestras were male. In the [[Vancouver Symphony Orchestra]], 67% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]], 74% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[National Arts Centre Orchestra]], 79% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]], 84% of the concerto soloists were male.&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; When the CBC news story on the gender balance of concerto soloists was released, the conductor of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, [[Bramwell Tovey]], disputed the accuracy of the news story in regards to his orchestra, arguing that the article only took a single season into account.

==Singers==

===Popular music===
[[File:Madonna Rebel Heart Tour 2015 - Amsterdam 2 (23823323680).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is often referred to as the artist who changed the role of women in popular music.]]

Singers in popular music perform the vocals for bands and other music groups, which may range in size from a [[Musical duo|duo]] or a [[power trio]] to a large jazz [[big band]]. Singers typically do both live performances and studio recordings. Singers who do live performances may sing in small venues such as [[coffeehouse]]s or [[nightclub]]s, or they may perform in larger venues ranging from arts centres to stadiums. Some singers also perform in music videos, which are used to promote the songs. In some styles of music, singers may play a [[rhythm section]] instrument, such as rhythm guitar, electric bass or a percussion instrument while they sing. In some styles of pop, singers perform choreographed dance moves during the show. Two well-known examples of pop singers who perform elaborate dance routines in their live shows are [[Madonna (singer)|Madonna]] and [[Britney Spears]].

Singer-songwriter and music producer [[Bjork]] has commented on how "women's labor and expertise—inside and outside of the music industry—go unnoticed." She has stated that "[I]t's invisible, what women do," and "[I]t's not rewarded as much."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; Bjork states "that her male collaborators are typically credited for the sound of her records; because on stage she mainly sings, there is a widespread assumption that she neither produces [as a music producer] nor plays an instrument."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; In 2015, "while accepting the Woman of the Year honor at this year's Billboard Women in Music event", [[Lady Gaga]] commented on the "difficulties of being a female recording artist." She said it "is really hard sometimes for women in music. It's like a f[uck]ing boys club that we just can't get in to." She stated that she "tried for so long... to be taken seriously as a musician for my intelligence more than my body", yet she felt that others in the industry did not believe that women could have a "musical background... [or] understand what you're doing because you're a female."&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt; A [[University Press of Kentucky]] book  states that customers did not treat a woman who worked at a guitar store like she knew anything about guitars until she would use special guitar terms.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Carson, Mina; Lewis, Tina; Shaw, Susan M. ''Girls Rock! Fifty Years of Women Making Music''. University Press of Kentucky. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Indie folk singer-songwriter/guitarist [[Ani di Franco]] states that for women, in the past, even entering a guitar store was an "act of courage" because it felt like a "boys' club".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Not only do female artists feel the pressure to please their male counterparts but it is also difficult for female DJs to fit in, in a male-dominated field&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ricochet.media/en/48/DJs-tackle-gender-bias|title=Female DJs tackle gender bias {{!}} Ricochet|work=Ricochet|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chaka Khan in Chris March 01.jpg|thumb|right|180 px |[[Chaka Khan]] (born 1953) has been called the "Queen of Funk."]]
Despite [[funk]]'s popularity in modern music, few people have examined the work of funk women. As cultural critic Cheryl Keyes explains in her essay "She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis," most of the scholarship around funk has focused on the cultural work of men. She states that "[[Betty Davis]] is an artist whose name has gone unheralded as a pioneer in the annals of funk and rock. Most writing on these musical genres has traditionally placed male artist like Jimi Hendrix, George Clinton (of Parliament-Funkadelic), and bassist Larry Graham as trendsetters in the shaping of a rock music sensibility"&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Keyes, "She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis" 35.&lt;/ref&gt; (35). Notable funk women include [[Chaka Khan]], [[Labelle]], [[Brides of Funkenstein]], [[Klymaxx]], [[Mother's Finest]], and [[Betty Davis]].

Below are some of the top-earning female singers in the [[2010s in music|2010s]]. Another way of selecting the most notable singers for this section would be by [[Music criticism|critical acclaim]], but this is a more subjective criteria than earnings.

[[Classic female blues]] was an early form of [[blues music]] popular in the 1920s. An amalgam of traditional folk blues and urban theater music, the style is also known as vaudeville blues.  Classic blues songs performed by female vocalists were accompanied by pianists or small jazz ensembles, and were the first blues to be recorded. The classic female blues singers were pioneers in the [[record industry]], as they were among the first black singers and blues artists who were recorded. They were also instrumental in popularizing the [[12-bar blues]] throughout the US.

[[Ma Rainey|Gertrude "Ma" Rainey]] (1886–1939), known as the "[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|Mother of]] the Blues", is credited as the first to perform the blues on stage as popular entertainment when she began incorporating blues into her act of show songs and [[comedy]] around 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Baxter, Derrick. ''Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues Singers''. New York: Stein &amp; Day Publishers, 1970. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Daphne Duval. ''Black Pearls: Blues Queens of the '20s''. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1988. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; New York-based cabaret singer [[Mamie Smith]] recorded "Crazy Blues" in 1920, which sold over 75,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Baxter, Derrick. ''Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues Singers''. New York: Stein &amp; Day Publishers, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith became known as "America's First Lady of the Blues". In 1920, the vaudeville singer [[Lucille Hegamin]] became the second black woman to record blues when she recorded "The Jazz Me Blues".&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Baxter, Derrick. ''Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues Singers''. New York: Stein &amp; Day Publishers, 1970. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethel Waters]], [[Alberta Hunter]], [[Mary Stafford (singer)|Mary Stafford]], [[Katie Crippen]], [[Edith Wilson (singer)|Edith Wilson]], and [[Esther Bigeou]], among others, made their first recordings before the end of 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Sheldon. ''Blues Who's Who'' (Revised Ed.). New York: Da Capo Press, 1994. pp. 48, 137, 254, 484, 540, 580.&lt;/ref&gt; These blues recordings were typically labeled as "[[race records]]" to distinguish them from records sold to white audiences. Nonetheless, the recordings of some of the classic female blues singers were purchased by white buyers as well.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Jesse R., and Abrol Fairweather. ''Blues: Thinking Deep about Feeling Low''. Hoboken, N.J. Wiley; Chichester: John Wiley [distributor], 2011, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marion Harris]] became one of the first white female singers to record the blues.

The most popular of the classic blues singers was [[Tennessee]]-born [[Bessie Smith]] (no relation to Mamie Smith), who first recorded in 1923 and became known as the "Empress of the Blues". She signed with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and became the highest-paid black artist of the 1920s, recording over 160 songs. Other classic blues singers who recorded extensively until the end of the 1920s were [[Ida Cox]], [[Clara Smith]], and [[Sara Martin]]. These early blues singers were an influence on later singers such as [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Janis Joplin]]. These blues women's contributions to the genre included "increased improvisation on melodic lines, unusual phrasing which altered the emphasis and impact of the lyrics, and vocal dramatics using shouts, groans, moans, and wails. The blues women thus effected changes in other types of popular singing that had spin-offs in jazz, [[Broadway musical]]s, [[torch song]]s of the 1930s and 1940s, [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rhythm and blues]], and eventually [[rock and roll]]."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Daphne Duval. ''Black Pearls: Blues Queens of the '20s''. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1988. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Country music ===
Gender discrimination and sexism occurs frequently in [[country music]]. In more recent times, a popular subgenre has developed: "Bro-Country", which has lyrics that sexually objectify women and frame them as assets for men's use. Some popular "Bro-Country" artists include [[Luke Bryan]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], and [[Blake Shelton]]. Gender discrimination and sexism has become more prominent in this genre over time. Dr. Eric Rasumssen, a professor in the College of Media and Communication and Texas Tech University, argues that compared to the 1990s and 2000s (decade), the country music of the 2010s discriminates more against women. Some of the ways they discriminate include, "talking more about women’s appearance, [showing] women in tight or revealing clothing, comparing women to objects, referring to women in slang [terms] versus their real names, and portraying women as distrustful and cheaters."

"Bro-Country" may be influenced by historical aspects of Southern culture which have been associated with racism and sexism. Women in country music continue to face these issues. [[Kacey Musgraves]], a recording artist, describes her experience with sexism in country music by stating that if a label can't get your song off the ground, it's immediately blamed on your personality or the fact that you're female, or that you didn't make a radio station program director feel important.

===Jazz===

While woman have been underrepresented in jazz as instrumentalists, composers, songwriters and bandleaders, there have been many notable women singers. [[Bessie Smith]] sang both the blues and jazz. [[Lena Horne]] first appeared in the [[Cotton Club]] as a teenager. [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Billie Holiday]] were known for their ballads during the swing era. [[Shirley Horn]] sang both jazz and blues. [[Nina Simone]] sang jazz, folk and Rhythm and blues. [[Etta Jones]] sang rhythm and blues and jazz. [[Anita O'Day]] is known for her contributions to Bebop. [[Betty Carter]] sang during the post-bop era. [[Mary Lou Williams]] was a singer and pianist during the swing and hard bop eras. [[Sarah Vaughan]] is known for her singing in the  Cool jazz era. Other notable singers include [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Diane Schuur]] and [[Flora Purim]]. Contemporary jazz singers include [[Norah Jones]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Melody Gardot]] and singer-bassist [[Esperanza Spalding]].

Classical singers typically do both live performances and recordings. Live performances may be in small venues, such as churches, or large venues, such as opera halls or arts centers. Classical singers may specialize in specific types of singing, such as [[art song]], which are songs performed with piano accompaniment, or opera, which is singing accompanied by a [[symphony orchestra]] in a staged, costumed theatrical production.  Classical singers are typically categorized by their voice type, which indicates both their vocal range and in some cases also the "color" of their voice. Examples of voice types that indicate the range of a singer's voice include [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]] (these go from the lowest range to the highest range). Examples of voice types that indicate both the singer's range and the "color" of her voice type are [[coloratura soprano]] and [[lyric soprano]]. Whereas popular music singers typically use a [[microphone]] and a [[sound reinforcement system]] for their vocals, in classical music the voice must be projected into the hall naturally, a skill for which they undertake vocal training.

L. Macy (Accessed 9 February 2009), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her singing career was spent performing in concert and recital in major music venues and with famous orchestras throughout the United States and Europe between 1925 and 1965. Anderson became an important figure in the struggle for black artists to overcome racial prejudice in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. In 1939, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in [[DAR Constitution Hall|Constitution Hall]]. With the aid of First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and her husband [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1939, on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C. She sang before a crowd of more than 75,000 people and a radio audience in the millions. Anderson continued to break barriers for black artists in the United States, becoming the first black person, American or otherwise, to perform at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City on 7 January 1955.

Women play an important role in [[world music]], a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the world, including [[ethnic music]] and [[traditional music]] from Africa, the Caribbean, South America, Asia, and other regions, indigenous music, neotraditional music, and music where more than one cultural tradition intermingle (e.g., mixtures of Western pop and ethnic music). The term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Erlmann, Veit|year=1996| title=Aesthetics of the Global Imagination: Reflections on World Music in the 1990s|journal=Public Culture|volume=8|issue=3|pages=467–488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Discourse of World Music |author=Frith, Simon|editor=Born and Hesmondhalgh|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|booktitle=Western Music and Its Others: Difference, Representation, and Appropriation in Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian actress, singer and dancer [[Carmen Miranda]] became known in the West as [[Exotism|exotic]] supplement in Hollywood films in the 1930s, akin to dancer [[Josephine Baker]] before, and the voice of [[exotica]] [[Yma Sumac]] after her. In the 1960s [[Elis Regina]] was the most prominent female singer in the [[Bossa Nova]] of Brazilian music that influenced popular music around the world. In the 1960s and 1970s Argentinian folk singer [[Mercedes Sosa]], South African [[Miriam Makeba]] or Greek [[Maria Farantouri]] were also recognized for their engagement against the oppressive political situation in their home states. Sosa singing "[[Gracias a la vida]]", Makeba's "[[Pata Pata]]", and Farantouri's collaboration with composer [[Mikis Theodorakis]] were musical icons of the struggle for [[human rights]]. The "Queen of Salsa" [[Celia Cruz]] immigrated from Cuba to the United States in 1966.

With the rising interest in the then so-called world music in the 1980s old recordings of long established artists were re-discovered for a global audience and distributed worldwide; well known in their home country –sometimes stars with legendary status– like Arabic singers [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Asmahan]], and [[Fairuz]], the Algerian [[Raï]] singer [[Cheikha Rimitti]], [[Asha Bhosle]], most prolific playback singer for [[Bollywood]] film soundtracks, Romani [[Esma Redžepova]], Mexican [[ranchera]] singer [[Chavela Vargas]], and the [[Mahotella Queens]] from South Africa; or they were recorded for the first time (by Caucasian males) like [[Cesária Évora]] from Cape Verde, [[Stella Chiweshe]] from Zimbabwe and Afro-Peruvian [[Susana Baca]].

There are many notable women world music performers, including: [[Ann Savoy]], [[Bi Kidude]], [[Brenda Fassie]], [[Chabuca Granda]], [[Chava Alberstein]], [[Cleoma Breaux Falcon]], [[Dolly Collins]], [[Elizabeth Cotten]], [[Frehel]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Genoa Keawe]], [[Googoosh]], [[Hazel Dickens]], [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Lola Beltrán]], [[Lucha Reyes (Peruvian singer)|Lucha Reyes]], [[Lucilla Galeazzi]] (The Mammas), [[Lydia Mendoza]], [[Maria Tanase]], [[Mariam Doumbia]], [[Nada Mamula]], [[Ofra Haza]], [[Oumou Sangare]], [[Rita Marley]], [[Rosa Passos]], [[Roza Eskenazi]], [[Safiye Ayla]], [[Salamat Sadikova]], [[Selda Bagcan]], [[Shirley Collins]], [[Valya Balkanska]], [[Violeta Parra]], [[Warda Al-Jazairia|Warda]], and [[Zap Mama]].

==Eastern music==

===Arabic music===
[[File:ComedianpartyBaghdad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A group of musicians, including women performers, from a Baghdad [[musical theatre]] group in the 1920s]]
[[Arabic music]], which has [[Persian traditional music|Persian]] origins,&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Age of the Moor''. By [[Ivan van Sertima]]. 1992. Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|1-56000-581-5}}. p.17&lt;/ref&gt;
is an amalgam of the music of the [[Arab people]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the music of all the varied peoples that make up the Arab world. In [[Music of Egypt|Egypt during the medieval era]], male professional musicians during this period were called Alateeyeh (plural), or Alatee (singular), which means "a player upon an instrument". However, this name applies to both vocalists as well as instrumentalists. Male professional musicians were considered disreputable and lowly, and they earned their living playing at parties. Female professional musicians in Egypt were called Awalim (pl) or Al'meh, which means a "learned female". These singers were often hired on the occasion of a celebration in the [[harem]] of a wealthy person. They were not with the harem, but in an elevated room that was concealed by a screen so as not to be seen by either the harem or the master of the house. The female Awalim were more highly paid than male performers and more highly regarded.

In the 9th century,  using male instrumentalists was harshly criticized in a treatise, because male musicians were associated with perceived vices such as playing [[chess]] and writing [[love poetry]]. Following the invasion of Egypt, [[Napoleon]] commissioned reports on the state of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] culture. The report reveals that there were [[guild]]s of male instrumentalists who played to male audiences, and "learned female" singer/musicians who sang and played for women audiences.

===Chinese music===

In [[Chinese music]], music was a major activity for women during Ancient times, especially for learned women. Women performers were associated with the [[guqin]] since ancient times. The guqin is a plucked seven-string [[Chinese musical instrument]] of the [[zither]] family. It has traditionally been favored by [[scholars]] and [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement. A notable woman guqin player was [[Cai Wenji]], associated with the piece ''Hujia Shiba-pai''.&lt;ref&gt;《胡笳十八拍》&lt;/ref&gt;

Women musicians also play a key role in Chinese folk music. In southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music]] is a genre of traditional Chinese folk ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] flute and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with the topic of a love-stricken woman.

The [[Chinese pop]] (C-pop) music industry in the 1930s and 1940s was dominated by the [[Seven Great Singing Stars]], who were the most renowned singers of China in the 1940s. [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Gong Qiuxia]], [[Yao Lee]] and [[Bai Hong]] emerged in the 1930s, while [[Bai Guang]], [[Li Xianglan]] and [[Wu Yingyin]] became popular in the 1940s. After 1949, these early generations of C-pop were denounced by the [[Communist Party of China]] as [[Yellow Music]] as it saw pop music as sexually indecent (the color yellow is associated with eroticism and sex in China). Only after the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], by the early 1980s, could Yellow Music be performed again.

Nowadays, after China's extensive political and cultural changes of the past 50 years, Chinese popular music has been increasingly emulating and taking inspiration from the styles of popular music of South Korea ([[K-pop]]) and of Japan ([[J-pop]]), both of which it now closely resembles. As such, during the 2010s, several [[girl groups]] have been established based both on the Japanese model, like [[SNH48]] (created in 2012) and its [[SNH48#Sister groups|sister groups]], as well as on the Korean model, like [[Rocket Girls (band)|Rocket Girls]], created in 2018 from the [[Produce 101 (Chinese TV series)|Chinese version]] of a Korean reality television talent competition show. These groups have achieved significant success, with the debut [[Extended play|EP]] of Rocket Girls selling over 1.6 million copies.&lt;ref name="Tencent"/&gt; Despite this though, solo Chinese female artists continue to be much more popular overall in the country, as they have traditionally been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://y.qq.com/portal/singer_list.html#area=200&amp;page=1&amp;sex=-100&amp;|title= 歌手列表|accessdate= August 26, 2018|work= [[QQ Music]]|publisher= [[Tencent]]|language= Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most recently popular solo Chinese female singers include 胡66, [[Ada Zhuang]], [[Kelly Yu]], 陳粒 ([[:zh:陳粒|zh]]), [[Feng Timo]], [[Bibi Zhou]], 双笙, [[Tia Ray]], 金玟岐 ([[:zh:金玟岐|zh]]) and [[Jane Zhang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://y.qq.com/portal/singer_list.html#area=200&amp;page=1&amp;sex=1&amp;|title= 歌手列表|accessdate= August 26, 2018|work= [[QQ Music]]|publisher= [[Tencent]]|language= Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian music===
[[File:Ms subbulakshmi.jpg|thumb|right|140px|The Indian Carnatic classical singer [[M.S. Subbulakshmi]] (1916–2004)]]
[[Indian classical music]] is the [[art music]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The origins of Indian classical music can be found in the [[Hindu]] hymns. This chanting style evolved into [[jatis]] and eventually into [[raga]]s. Indian classical music has also been significantly influenced by, or syncretised with, Indian folk music. The major composers from the historical Indian classical music tradition were men. Modern women vocalists include [[D. K. Pattammal]], [[M. S. Subbalakshmi]], [[Gangubai Hangal]], [[Hirabai Barodekar]], [[Kesarbai Kerkar]], [[Kishori Amonkar]], [[Malini Rajurkar]], [[Mogubai Kurdikar]], [[Prabha Atre]], [[Roshan Ara Begum]] and [[Shruti Sadolikar Katkar]]. One woman instrumentalist is [[Annapurna Devi]].

In [[Indian folk music]], [[lavani]] is a music genre popular in [[Maharashtra]] that is traditionally performed by women.
[[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]] ([[Gurmukhi|Punjabi]]: ਭੰਗੜਾ) is a form of [[dance]]-oriented [[folk music]] of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The present musical style is derived from non traditional musical accompaniment to the riffs of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] called by the same name. The female dance of [[Punjab region]] is known as [[Giddha]] ([[Gurmukhi|Punjabi]]: ਗਿੱਧਾ).

In the [[music of Bollywood]] (the centre of India's film industry) and other regional film industries in India, women [[playback singer]]s have had a significant role, with the sisters [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Asha Bhosle]], who have mainly worked in Hindi films, often referred to as two of the best-known and most prolific playback singers in India. In 2011, Bhosle was officially acknowledged by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the most recorded artist in music history.&lt;ref name="indiatoday.intoday.in"/&gt;

===Iranian music===
[[File:Parisa.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Fātemeh Vā'ezi ({{lang-fa|فاطمه واعظی}}) (born 1950), commonly known by her stage name Parīsā ({{lang-fa| پریسا}}), is a [[Persian traditional music|Persian classical]] vocalist and musician.]]

Since the [[Iranian revolution]], Iranian female solo vocalists have been permitted to perform for female audiences. Female vocalists can perform for male audiences only as a part of a chorus. Traditionally, it has been difficult for female singers to appear publicly. Women were only allowed to perform for religious rituals, called [[Tazieh]], and men were generally forbidden to listen to women. Before the Revolution, [[Women's rights in Iran|Iranian women]] could only sing in private, while working, for other women, or during women's celebrations. [[Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri]] (1905-1959) is one of the first female masters of Persian music. Notable female musicians include [[Delkash]] (1923-2004); [[Simin Ghanem]] (born 1944); [[Maryam Akhondy]] (born 1957), founder of Barbad Ensemble; Persian classical guitarist [[Lily Afshar]]; singer [[Shakila]], winner of Persian Academy Award; the conductor [[Soodabeh Salem]]; [[Afsaneh Rasaei]]; [[Pirayeh Pourafar]], founder of Nava Ensemble and Lian Ensemble; and [[Mahsa Vahdat]].

The classical singer [[Fatemeh Vaezi]] (commonly known by her stage name "Parisa") has given concerts accompanied by a female orchestra. After 1986 [[Maryam Akhondy]] started working with other Iranian musicians in exile. In 2000 Maryam Akhondy created the all-female a cappella group  Banu which sung old folk songs that were part of women's activities and celebrations. Singer [[Sima Bina]] has taught many female students. [[Ghashang Kamkar]] teaches both male and female students. Both Ghashang and Vaezi have criticized the patriarchal power structure in Iran for its treatment of female musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Javaheri, 'With These Problems of Life, There Is No Time for Art,' trans. Maryam Habibian, Zanan, No. 36 (1997), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian folk-music performers include [[Sima Bina]], [[Darya Dadvar]], [[Monika Jalili]], [[Ziba Shirazi]], [[Zohreh Jooya]], and [[Shusha Guppy|Shushā Guppy]]. Iranian pop performers include [[Googoosh]], [[Hayedeh]], [[Mahasti]], [[Leila Forouhar]], [[Pooran (singer)|Pooran]], and [[Laleh Pourkarim]]. World music performers include [[Azam Ali]] and [[Cyminology|Cymin Samawatie]].

==Music scholars and educators==

===Musicologists and music historians===
[[File:Rosetta Reitz.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rosetta Reitz]] (1924–2008) was an American [[jazz]] historian and [[feminist]] who established a record label producing 18 albums of the music of the early women of jazz and the blues.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Martin, Douglas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/arts/music/15reitz.html "Rosetta Reitz, Champion of Jazz Women, Dies at 84"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 November 2008. Accessed 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The vast majority of major [[musicology|musicologists]] and music historians have been men. Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Accessed 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

Other notable women scholars include:

*[[Eva Badura-Skoda]]
*[[Margaret Bent]]
*[[Suzanne Cusick]]
*[[Ursula Günther]]
*[[Maud Cuney Hare]]

===Ethnomusicologists===
[[File:Frances Densmore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frances Densmore]] (1867&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1957) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]] known for her studies of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[music]] and [[culture]].]]

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
Ethnomusicology –&amp;nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἔθνος (''ethnos'', "nation") and μουσική (''mousike'', "music")&amp;nbsp;– is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. Initially, ethnomusicology was almost exclusively oriented toward non-[[Western world|Western]] music, but now includes the study of Western music from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives.

Notable ethnomusicologists include:

*[[Judith Becker]]
*[[Frances Densmore]]
*[[Ida Halpern]]
*[[Maud Karpeles]]

===Music educators===

{{Main|Women in music education}}
While music critics argued in the 1880s that "women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "to such a degree that women dominated music education during the latter half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; "Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences.

A woman, Frances Clarke (1860-1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination." After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers |title=A historical view of women in music education careers |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction .&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;

==Conducting==

The majority of professional orchestra [[Conducting|conductors]] are male; ''The Guardian'' called conducting "one of the last [[glass ceilings]] in the music industry".&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt; A 2013 article stated that in France, out of 574 concerts only 17 were conducted by women and no women conducted at the [[Paris National Opera|National Opéra in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Victor Tribot Laspière | title=Une main ferme à l’Orchestre national de France | url=http://www.francemusique.fr/actu-musicale/ou-sont-les-femmes-dans-la-musique-7766 | work=France Musique | date=2013-10-02 | accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bachtrack'' reported that, in a list of the world's 150 top conductors that year, only five were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classical-music.com/article/11-of-best-female-conductors |title=11 of today's top women conductors |publisher=Classical-Music.com |date=2015-03-06 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of female conductors have become top-ranked international conductors. In January 2005, Australian conductor [[Simone Young]] became the first woman to conduct the [[Vienna Philharmonic]]. In 2008 [[Marin Alsop]], a protégé of [[Leonard Bernstein]], became the first woman to become the music director and principal conductor of a major US orchestra when she won the top job at the [[Baltimore Symphony]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Clemency |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130821-why-so-few-women-conductors |title=Culture - Why aren't there more women conductors? |publisher=BBC |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were "protests from a large swathe of the Baltimore Symphony when she was first named Music Director", but since that time, "plaudits [have] roll[ed] in."&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; In 2014, Alsop was the first woman conductor to lead the [[Last Night of the Proms]] concert–one of the most important classical music events in Britain–in its 118-year history.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

[[Jeri Lynne Johnson]] was the first [[African-American]] woman to win an international conducting prize when she was awarded the Taki Concordia conducting fellowship in 2005. She is the founder and music director of the Black Pearl Chamber Orchestra, the first multi-ethnic professional [[orchestra]] in [[Philadelphia]]. A graduate of [[Wellesley College]] and the [[University of Chicago]], she is a [[Conducting|conductor]], [[composer]] and [[pianist]]. From 2001-2004, she was the assistant conductor of The [[Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22jeri+lynne+johnson%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6vLxS8CJM8GB8gb0sZzvDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jeri%20lynne%20johnson%22&amp;f=false|title=Sisters in the Spotlight|date=March 2003|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has led orchestras around the world including the [[Colorado Symphony Orchestra|Colorado Symphony]], [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra|Bournemouth Symphony]] (UK), and the Weimar Staatskapelle (Germany). Alongside prominent woman conductors [[Marin Alsop]] and [[JoAnn Falletta]], Ms. Johnson was heralded on the [[NBC]] [[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]] as one of the nation's leading female conductors.

According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, "The music world has been happy to have female performers ...for a long time...[;]But owning authority and power in public is another matter. That's where female conductors have had a hard time. Our society is more resistant to women being powerful in public than to women being entertaining."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; The low percentage of women conductors is not because women do not study in [[music school]]; indeed, in 2009 and 2012 almost half of the recipients of [[Doctor of Musical Arts|conducting doctorates]] were women.&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt;

===Sexism and gender discrimination===
Women conductors faced sexism and gender discrimination throughout the 19th century and 20th century. "To break down this apparent employment barrier, women created their own opportunities by founding and organizing all-female orchestras"; one example is the Fadette Women's Orchestra in Boston founded in 1888 by conductor Caroline B. Nichols.&lt;ref&gt;[http://symposium.music.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2151:women-orchestral-conductors-in-america-the-struggle-for-acceptance%E2%80%94an-historical-view-from-the-nineteenth-century-to-the-present&amp;Itemid=124] {{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other all-women orchestras were founded in the early decades of the 20th century, and women conductors led these groups.

Women conductors continue to face sexism and gender discrimination in the early decades of the 21st century. In the 2010s, several notable male conductors and musicians made sexist statements about women conductors. In 2013, "[[Vasily Petrenko]], the principal conductor of the [[Oslo Philharmonic]] and the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]], provoked outrage when he told a Norwegian newspaper that 'orchestras react better when they have a man in front of them."&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Charlotte Higgins |author2=chief arts writer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/02/male-conductors-better-orchestras-vasily-petrenko |title=Male conductors are better for orchestras, says Vasily Petrenko &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "when women have families, it becomes difficult to be as dedicated as is demanded in the business".&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt; [[Bruno Mantovani]], the director of the [[Paris Conservatoire]], gave an interview in which he made sexist statements about women conductors. Mantovani raised the "problem of [[maternity]]" and he questioned the ability of women to withstand the physical challenges and stresses of the profession, which he claimed involve "conducting, taking a plane, taking another plane, conducting again."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; [[Yuri Temirkanov]], the music director of the [[St. Petersburg Philharmonic]], made sexist statements about women conductors in a September 2013 interview, stating that "The essence of the conductor's profession is strength. The essence of a woman is weakness."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; Finnish conductor [[Jorma Panula]] made sexist statements about women conductors in 2014; he stated that "women [conductors are not]… getting any better – only worse", which he called a "purely biological question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2014/04/05/editorial-cbc-classical-music-gender-gap-article-poses-new-questions/ |title=Musical Toronto |publisher=Musical Toronto |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music critics==

===Popular music===
[[File:Ann Powers 01A.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American pop music critic [[Ann Powers]] (pictured in 2007)]]
According to Anwen Crawford, the "problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago", which means that "[b]ooks by living female rock critics (or jazz, hip-hop, and dance-music critics, for that matter) are scant". Crawford notes that the "most famous rock-music critics—[[Robert Christgau]], [[Greil Marcus]], [[Lester Bangs]], [[Nick Kent]]—are all male".&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

Sociologist [[Simon Frith]] noted that pop and rock music "are closely associated with gender; that is, with conventions of male and female behaviour".&lt;ref name=Frith2001&gt;Frith, Simon, "Pop Music" in S. Frith, W. Stray and J. Street, ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock]]'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Holly Kruse, both popular music articles and academic articles about pop music are usually written from "masculine subject positions".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Steve, ed. (2002). Pop Music and the Press. Temple University Press. ASIN B00EKYXY0K. {{ISBN|9781566399661}}. p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As well, there are relatively few women writing in music journalism: "By 1999, the number of female editors or senior writers at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' hovered around...15%, [while] at ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' and ''[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]]'', [it was] roughly 20%."&lt;ref&gt;McLeod (2002) at 94, quoted in {{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Marion |chapter=Meaning Making in the Press |title=Gender in the Music Industry: Rock, Discourse, and Girl Power |location=Aldershot, Hampshire, England  |year= 2007 |page=67 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd  |isbn=9780754638629 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMtDpy85IC4C&amp;pg=PA67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism associated with gender was discussed in a 2014 ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'' article about the struggles of women in music journalism, written by music critic Tracy Moore, previously an editor at the ''[[Nashville Scene]]''.&lt;ref name=moore2014&gt;{{cite web|author=Moore, Tracy |date=20 March 2014 |title=Oh, the Unbelievable Shit You Get Writing About Music as a Woman |work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] |url=http://jezebel.com/oh-the-unbelievable-shit-you-get-writing-about-music-a-1547444869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American music critic [[Ann Powers]], as a female critic and journalist for a popular, male-dominated industry, has written critiques the perceptions of sex, racial and social minorities in the music industry. She has also written about feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/resource/3696 |title=Why I Write: Ann Powers Reflects on Writing About Rock|website=Nwp.org|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rockhall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6485_guest-blog-ann-powers/|title=Pop music critic Ann Powers searches for the language of rock and roll|website=Rockhall.com|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 she accepted a position as chief pop-music critic at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', where she succeeded [[Robert Hilburn]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick MacDonald, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/artsentertainment/2002848360_aebriefs07.html Ann Powers named L.A.

Anwen Crawford, a writer for ''[[The Monthly]]'' contributed to Jessica Hopper's book of essays and profiles entitled ''The First Collection of Criticism by a Living Female Rock Critic''.&lt;ref name="thefader.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/06/03/the-world-doesnt-need-more-female-music-critics|title=The World Doesn’t Need More Female Music Critics|website=Thefader.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford's article "explores women's long struggle for visibility and recognition in the field of rock criticism, even though we've been helping to pioneer it from the start".&lt;ref name="thefader.com"/&gt; Crawford states that "[t]he record store, the guitar shop, and now social media: when it comes to popular music, these places become stages for the display of male prowess"; "[f]emale expertise, when it appears, is repeatedly dismissed as fraudulent. Every woman who has ever ventured an opinion on popular music could give you some variation [of this experience]... and becoming a recognized "expert" (a musician, a critic) will not save [women] from accusations of fakery."&lt;ref name="thefader.com"/&gt;

===Classical music===
[[File:Marion Lignana Rosenberg.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Marion Lignana Rosenberg]] (1961–2013) was a music critic, writer, translator, broadcaster and journalist. She wrote for many periodicals, including [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Playbill]]''.]]
"The National Arts Journalism Program (NAJP) at Columbia... completed a large study of arts journalism in America [in 2005]. They found that 'the average classical music critic is a white, 52-year-old male with a [[graduate degree]], but twenty-six percent of all critics writing are female.'" However, William Osborne points out that this 26% figure includes all newspapers, including low-circulation regional papers. Osborne states that the "large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics." The only female critics from major US papers are [[Anne Midgette]] (''New York Times'') and Wynne Delacoma (''Chicago Sun-Times''). Midgette was the "first woman to cover classical music in the entire history of the paper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/women-critics.htm |title=Women Music Critics |publisher=Osborne-conant.org |date=2005-06-11 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susannah Clapp]], a critic from ''The Guardian''–a newspaper that has a female classical music critic–stated in May 2014 that she had only then realized "what a rarity" a female classical music critic is in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/25/sexism-stage-critics-tara-erraught-glyndebourne |title=Time to bring down the curtain on stage critics' sexism &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=The Guardian |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other musical professions==

===Record producing and sound engineering===
A 2013 ''Sound on Sound'' article stated that there are "few women in [[Music producer|record production]] and [[sound engineering]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ncube states that "[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male, and although there are female producers achieving great things in music, they are less well-known than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; "Only three women have ever been nominated for best producer at the Brits or the [[Grammys]]" and none won either award.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19284058 |title=Why are female record producers so rare? - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2012-08-29 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Women who want to enter the [producing] field face a boys' club, or a [[guild]] mentality".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The UK "Music Producers' Guild says less than 4% of its members are women" and at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, "only 6% of the students enrolled on its sound technology course are female."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Speaking about the 1970s, Tom Jones mentions in his recent autobiography "We had [[Lynsey de Paul]], a big star, though she fell out with [[Gordon Mills]] for wanting to produce her own records" - however, she managed to do this and eventually produced male artists such as ex-Move singer [[Carl Wayne]] and [[Lenny Zakatek]], as well as [[Vera Lynn]] and [[Shirley Bassey]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir Tom Jones (2015). Over The Top and Back: The Autobiography. {{ISBN|978-1592409617}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ruth Saxelby's article "Why aren't more women becoming music producers?", she states that "beats aren't gendered, so why do women represent less than 5% of music producers and engineers"? Saxelby interviewed 13 women who work as music producers to seek the potential causes of this situation.&lt;ref name=Fader&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/10/30/why-arent-more-women-becoming-music-producers|title=Why aren't more women becoming music producers?|date=30 October 2014|work=The FADER|first=Ruth|last=Saxelby}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatima Al Qadiri from New York states that "women are expected to be the sexualized commercial object for sale in music, and production and engineering [are fields where women are] rarely [able to be] objectified for financial gain [by the music industry]"; as such, the industry does not use women producers or engineers.&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Qadiri said barriers to women in production and sound engineering include "misogyny, sexism, unequal pay,...[and] pressure to make your body (rather than your music) the central focus of your career."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Caroline Polachek from New York states that "an artist is not as likely to bring in a woman to produce his track as a man, not because of a bias against women per se, but because on some level it's playing safe: a killer producer, history tells us, looks like a man."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt;

[[WondaGurl]] from Toronto states that "there aren't many female producer and engineers, because they find this side of the business to be mostly male-dominated and many woman do not like to have to compete with men."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Holly Herndon from San Francisco states that "[m]usic, despite common misconceptions, is quite conservative. The archetypes don't seem to ever really change...Every year we get a diva, a dancer,...a girl next door, a fashion queen, a dainty songstress; all younger updates on a previous [year's] model. No room for new archetypes [such as women producers]." Herndon points out that [[Missy Elliott]] "exists outside of those narrow roles..."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Asma Maroof from Los Angeles says women are "intimidated by such a male-driven profession."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt;

Tokimonsta, also from Los Angeles, states that "our culture has systematically engrained this idea that technology is more of a man's thing."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Ikonika from London, UK, states that the music industry is "sexist and racist".&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Anna Lunoe from Sydney, Australia, states that "more girls [should be] exposed to introductory production workshops" and "production mentoring programs that are... aimed at promising young female engineers".&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Leila from London, UK, states that "[t]here have been a fair few [female producers and engineers]", from [[Delia Derbyshire]] to [[Tina Weymouth]] to Susan Day to Missy Elliot to [[Zavoloka]]. Leila suggests that to increase the number of women in music production and sound engineering, girls should be given training in computers and software coding.

One of the first women to produce, engineer, arrange and promote music on her own [[rock and roll]] music label was [[Cordell Jackson]] (1923-2004). She founded the Moon Records label in Memphis in 1956 after a few years of recording demos at [[Sam Phillips]]' Memphis Recording Service and [[Sun Records Studio]]. Unable to break into the [[Sun Records]] label's stable of male artists, she received the advice and assistance of [[RCA Records]]' [[Chet Atkins]] in forming this new label to release her music. She began releasing and promoting on the label singles she recorded in her home studio, serving as engineer, producer and arranger. The artists recorded included her and a small family of early [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], and [[country music]] performers she recruited from several Southern states.

[[Trina Shoemaker]] is a mixer, [[record producer]] and [[sound engineer]] responsible for producing/engineering and/or mixing records for bands such as [[Queens of the Stone Age]],&lt;ref name="Allmusic credits1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trina Shoemaker Credits|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/trina-shoemaker-p161871/credits|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sheryl Crow]],&lt;ref name="Allmusic credits1" /&gt; [[Emmylou Harris]],&lt;ref name="Allmusic credits1" /&gt; [[Something for Kate]],&lt;ref name="Allmusic credits2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trina Shoemaker Credits (pg. 2)|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/trina-shoemaker-p161871/credits/date-asc/100|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nanci Griffith]]&lt;ref name="Allmusic credits2" /&gt;  and many more.

[[Gail Davies]] was the '...first female producer in [[country music]], delivering a string of Top 10 hits in the '70s and '80s including "[[Someone Is Looking for Someone Like You]]," "[[Blue Heartache]]" and "[[I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)]]."&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; When she moved to [[Nashville]] in 1976, men "didn't want to work for a woman" and she was told women in the city were "still barefoot, pregnant and [singing] in the vocal booth."&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; 
[[Wendy Waldman]], who became a producer after Davies, saw that Davies had a difficult time. When Jonell Polansky arrived in Nashville in 1994, with a degree in [[electrical engineering]] and recording experience in the Bay Area, she was told "[y]ou're a woman, and we already had one"–a reference to Waldman.&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; 
KK Proffitt, who is a studio "owner and chief engineer" states that men in Nashville do not want to have women in the recording booth. At a meeting of the [[Audio Engineering Society]], Proffitt was told to "shut up" by a male producer when she raised the issue of updating studio recording technologies.&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; Proffitt said she finds "finds sexism rampant in the industry".&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt;

===DJs and turntablists ===

[[File:FemaleDJ.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A DJ mixing two record players at a live event]]
Women in music are often seen mainly in singing roles in [[popular music]] and there are relatively few women [[DJ]]s or [[turntablist]]s in [[hip hop music]], [[house music]], [[nu metal]] and other genres where DJs and turntablists participate. Indeed, all of these genres are very male-dominated. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs, such as audio engineering and production.  In 2007 Mark Katz's article "Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle," stated that "very few women battle; the matter has been a topic of conversation among hip-hop DJs for years."&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Mark|date=12 December 2007|title=Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle|url=https://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/4/580.full#fn-9|journal=The Musical Quarterly|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gdm007|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Rebekah Farrugia states "the male-centricity of EDM culture" contributes to "a marginalisation of women in these [EDM] spaces." &lt;ref name="Farrugia"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Dance Floor: Female DJs, Technology and Electronic Dance Music Culture|last=Farrugia |first=Rebekah |publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1841505664|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as "male technophilia."&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt; Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology. She explains: "an exclusive focus on women's supposed failure to enter the field … is insufficient for understanding how our stereotypical notions have come into being; it tends to put the burden of proof entirely on women and to blame them for their supposedly inadequate socialization, their lack of aspiration, and their want of masculine values. An equally challenging question is why and how boys have come to love things technical, how boys have historically been socialized as technophiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oldenziel|first=Ruth A. |date=1997 |title=Boys and Their Toys: The Fisher Body Craftsman's Guild, 1930–1968, and the Making of a Male Technical Domain|url=|journal=Technology and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Riot Grrrl===
[[File:Carrie Brownstein.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Carrie Brownstein]] from the punk-indie band [[Sleater-Kinney]], performing at Vegoose in 2005]]
[[Riot grrrl]] is an [[underground music|underground]] [[feminist]] [[hardcore punk]] movement that originally started in the early 1990s, in Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1080646/its-riot-grrrl-day-in-boston-here-are-songs-to-rock-out-to-at-work|title=Boston wins 'Most Feminist City' with Riot Grrrl Day — we made a playlist to celebrate|date=9 April 2015|website=Sheknows.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the greater [[Pacific Northwest]], noticeably in [[Olympia, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feliciano|first1=Steve|title=The Riot Grrrl Movement |url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/06/19/riot-grrrl-movement|publisher=New York Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with [[third-wave feminism]], which is sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Leonard. "Riot grrrl." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 20 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, [[domestic abuse]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], racism, [[patriarchy]], and female [[empowerment]]. Bands associated with the movement include [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Excuse 17]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[Cake Like]], [[Skinned Teen]], [[Emily's Sassy Lime]], [[Sleater-Kinney]], and also [[queercore]] groups like [[Team Dresch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223012118/http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13 |archivedate=23 February 2009|title=List of Riot Girl Bands |publisher=Hot-topic.org |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zqSn0jMJAQC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=Dickless%20riot&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=Dickless&amp;f=false|first=Marisa|last=Meltzer|page=42 |title=Girl Power: The Nineties Revolution in Music|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781429933285|date=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a [[Indie music scenes|music scene]] and [[genre]], riot grrrl is a [[subculture]] involving a [[DIY ethic]], [[zine]]s, art, political action, and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = W.W.

The use of the word "girl" was meant to indicate a time when girls are least influenced by societal pressures and therefore have the strongest self-esteem – childhood. The anger behind the movement was noted by the alternate spelling of the word as "grrrl", which sounds like a growl.&lt;ref name="Schilt" /&gt;

They partook in a new type of punk feminism that promoted the idea of do-it-yourself, exchanging [[manifesto]]s and trading mixed tapes of favorite bands to get the word out.&lt;ref name="Nguyen 173–196"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Mimi Thi|date=2012-07-01|title=Riot Grrrl, Race, and Revival|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0740770X.2012.721082|journal=Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory|volume=22|issue=2-3|pages=173–196|doi=10.1080/0740770X.2012.721082|issn=0740-770X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were tired of women being erased from history or having their experiences misinterpreted and ignored by others. In, response to patriarchal violence, adultism, and [[heterocentrism]],&lt;ref name="Kearney"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Mary Celeste|year=1995|title=Riot Grrrl: It's Not Just Music, It's Not Just Punk|url=|journal=Spectator|volume=16|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot grrrl engaged in negative emotional expressions and rhetoric similar to that of feminism and the punk aesthetic. The feminist argument that the personal is political was revisited in the image that Riot grrrl set forth, similarly to the culture of Punk that [[self-actualization]] is not to be found in external forces but rather through an individual's true self. By recognizing and reevaluating the institutional structures that affect individual experiences within social situations, an individual can gain the knowledge to better know herself and therefore know how to present herself to others so that they may know her accurately. Riot grrrl termed this movement to self-actualization, girl love – "girls learning to love themselves, and each other, against those forces that would otherwise see them destroyed or destroy themselves".

The accompanying slogan "every girl is a riot grrrl" reinforced the solidarity that women could find amongst themselves. This created an intimate aesthetic and sentimental politic well expressed in the production of zines (a shortened version of "fanzines").&lt;ref name="Schilt" /&gt; [[Zine]]s were handmade, crafted by individuals who wanted to connect directly with their readers, with simple items like scissors, glue, and tape. They called out injustices and challenged the norms that typically directed the expression of sexuality and domestic abuse, providing a space for women to exchange personal stories to which many others could relate. They challenged girls and women alike to stand up for themselves in a political atmosphere that actively sought to silence them.&lt;ref name="Kearney" /&gt; The shared personal stories were, at times, met with attitudes that reduced the communication to "it’s all just girls in their bedrooms, sprawled out writing in their diaries, and then they’ll send them to each other", while the choice to share in that way was an aesthetic one.

In the midst of this raising of awareness, riot grrrls had to address the generalizations that worked for them but that could not apply to women of color. Not all girls could be riot grrrl after all, for lack of privilege barred them from participating in such acts as writing "SLUT" across their stomach in an attempt to reclaim sexual agency.&lt;ref name="Nguyen 173–196"/&gt; While this performance is an earnest one, racism had already labeled women of color as that term. As observed by Kearny, "the gender deviance displayed by riot grrrls is a privilege to which only middle-class white girls have access."&lt;ref name="Kearney" /&gt; Another aspect of this need for inclusive [[discourse]] arose in the movement's preference for concrete knowledge and a disregard for the abstract that would foster theoretical inquiry.

===Festivals===
Women's music festivals, which may also be called [[womyn]]'s music festivals, have been held since the 1970s. Some women's music festivals are organized for [[lesbian]]s. The first women's music festival was held in 1973 at Sacramento State University. In May, 1974 the first National Woman's Music Festival was held in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, founded by [[University of Illinois]] student Kristin Lems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=DIL19740326.2.55&amp;srpos=6&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-national+women's+music+festival------|title=Daily Illini 26 March 1974 — Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections|website=Idnc.library.illinois.edu|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It celebrated its fortieth year in Middleton, Wisconsin, from 2–5 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaonline.org|title=National Womens Music Festival - July 5-8, 2018     Middleton, Wisconsin|website=Wiaonline.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, it is a four-day event that includes concerts, workshops, comedy, theatre, films and writing events that "promote and affirm the creative talents and technical skills of women" from diverse, multicultural communities, including women with disabilities. While most attendees are women, men can attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaonline.org/wia/membership-and-donation/|title=Membership and Contributions - National Womens Music Festival|website=Wiaonline.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]] was created in 1976, and became the largest festival in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1999:28&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a festival that focuses on music is the Women in Music Festival held by the [[University of Rochester]]'s [[Eastman School of Music]]. The festival began in 2005 as a celebration of the contributions of women to composition, performance, teaching, scholarship, and music administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esm.rochester.edu/wmf|title=Women in Music Festival|website=Women in Music Festival|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its modest beginnings of Eastman students and faculty members performing music by women composers, the Festival has grown to include additional concerts and events throughout Rochester, NY and to host composers-in-residence, who have included [[Tania León]] (2007), [[Nancy Van de Vate]] (2008), [[Judith Lang Zaimont]] (2009), [[Emma Lou Diemer]] (2010), and [[Hilary Tann]] (2011). The festival has presented more than 291 different works by 158 composers.

Many other festivals have been created throughout the United States and Canada since the mid-1970s and vary in size from a few hundred to thousands of attendees. The [[Los Angeles Women's Music Festival]] began in 2007 with over 2500 attendees.  Events outside the US include the Sappho Lesbian Witch Camp, near Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada and the Sistajive Women's Music Festival in Australia. Some festivals are focused around the lesbian community, such as the Ohio Lesbian Festival, near Columbus Ohio, which was created in 1988; Christian Lesbians Out (CLOUT), which holds a gathering in early August in Washington, DC; The Old Lesbian Gathering, a festival in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and RadLesFes, an event held in the middle of November near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Feminist-oriented festivals include the Southern Womyn's Festival in Dade City, Florida; the Gulf Coast Womyn's Festival in Ovett, Missouri; Wiminfest in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Womongathering, the Festival of Womyn's Spirituality; the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, near Hart, Michigan; and the Midwest Womyn's Festival in DeKalb, Illinois.

While women's music festivals are centered on music, they support many other facets of [[lesbian]] and [[feminist]] culture.  Some festivals are designed to provide a [[safe space]] for women's music and culture. Many festivals are held on college campuses or in remote rural locations, where attendees stay in campsites. Many festivals offer workshops on arts, crafts, fitness, and athletic events that women may not be able find in mainstream culture.  In her book ''Eden Built by Eves'', Bonnie Morris describes how women's music festivals serve women throughout the stages of their lives. Since the festivals are organized by women, for women, daycare and childcare facilities are typically provided. Festivals often provide a safe space for [[coming of age]] rituals for young women, adult romance and commitment ceremonies, the expression of alternative perspectives on motherhood, and the expression of grief and loss.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lilith Fair====
[[File:Sarah McLachlan 29 July 2010.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Lilith Fair]] co-founder [[Sarah McLachlan]]]]
[[Lilith Fair]] was a [[concert tour]] and travelling music festival that consisted solely of female solo artists and female-led bands. It was founded by Canadian musician [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Nettwerk Music Group]]'s [[Dan Fraser]] and [[Terry McBride (CEO)|Terry McBride]], and New York talent agent Marty Diamond. It took place during the summers of 1997 to 1999, and was revived in the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128588089 |title=With Sales Lagging, Lilith Fair Faces Question of Relevance |last=Pellegrinelli |first=Lara |date=19 July 2010 |website=NPR |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McLachlan organized the festival after she became frustrated with concert promoters and radio stations that refused to feature two female musicians in a row.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9807/28/lilith.fair/ | title=Lilith Fair: Lovely, lively and long overdue | first=Donna | last=Freydkin | publisher=CNN | date=28 July 1998 | accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bucking conventional industry wisdom, she booked a successful tour for herself and [[Paula Cole]]. At least one of their appearances together – in McLachlan's home town, on 14 September 1996 – went by the name "Lilith Fair" and included performances by McLachlan, Cole, [[Lisa Loeb]] and [[Michelle McAdorey]], formerly of [[Crash Vegas]].

The next year, McLachlan founded the Lilith Fair tour, taking ''Lilith'' from the medieval Jewish legend that [[Lilith]] was [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s first wife. In 1997, Lilith Fair garnered a $16&amp;nbsp;million gross, making it the top-grossing of any touring festival.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"/&gt; Among all concert tours for that year, it was the 16th highest grossing.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"/&gt;
The festival received several pejorative nicknames, including "Breast-fest", "Girlapalooza", and "Clam Jam".&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071698/fea_lilith.shtml]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/music_popular,5.html |title=ARTS : Music: Popular |publisher=Glbtq.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
