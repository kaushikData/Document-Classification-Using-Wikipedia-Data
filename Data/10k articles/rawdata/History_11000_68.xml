      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3410">The '''Air Transportation Stabilization Board''' (ATSB) is an office of [[United States Department of the Treasury]] created to assist [[United States|US]] [[airline]]s in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, signed into law September 22, 2001, authorizes the board to issue up to $10 billion in federal loan guarantees to air carriers for which credit is not otherwise available and where "such agreement is a necessary part of maintaining a safe, efficient and viable commercial aviation system in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;ATSB Loan Guarantees,{{cite web|url=http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/atsb/loan-guarantees.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220134114/http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/atsb/loan-guarantees.shtml |archivedate=2008-02-20 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Loan guarantees==
Between 2001 and 2003, the ATSB approved applications for loan guarantees from seven carriers: [[America West Airlines]], [[US Airways]], [[American Trans Air]], [[Aloha Airlines]], [[Frontier Airlines]], [[Evergreen International Airlines]], and [[World Airways]]. These carriers accepted loan guarantees worth $1.179 billion.

The ATSB denied applications from nine carriers: Ozark Airlines dba [[Great Plains Airlines]], [[MEDjet International]], [[Corporate Airlines]], [[Gemini Air Cargo]], [[Frontier Flying Service]], [[Spirit Airlines]], [[National Airlines (N7)|National Airlines]], and both initial and revised applications from [[United Airlines]] and [[Vanguard Airlines]].

==ATSB Results==

===Successes===
*'''America West Airlines''' - ceases to exist, merges with US Airways under the [[US Airways Group]] umbrella.
*'''US Airways''' - merges with America West to form US Airways
:Additionally with this merger, US Airways survived long enough to merge yet again, into and with [[American Airlines Group]] thus becoming; [[American Airlines]].

===Still in Business and holding on in life support===
*'''Frontier Airlines''' - reorganizes after a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and is acquired by [[Republic Airways Holdings]] and then the private investment group Indigo Partners.

===Casualties===
*'''Aloha Airlines''' - shut down in a chapter 7 bankruptcy filing.
*'''American Trans Air''' - acquired by the private equity firm [[MatlinPatterson|MatlinPatterson's]] Global Aero Logistics and shut down in chapter 7 bankruptcy filing.
*'''Evergreen International Airlines'''  
*'''World Airways''' - acquired by the same group as [[American Trans Air|ATA]] and also shut down by the same private equity firm

'''Alfred John Dunkin''' (1812–1879) was a British antiquary and historian.{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=201}}

==Life==
He was the only son of [[John Dunkin]] by his wife Anne, daughter of [[William Chapman (engineer)|William Chapman]], civil engineer, was born at Islington, London, on 9 August 1812. 
He received his education at the [[Military College]], Vendôme.{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=201}}

In 1831, he entered his father's printing and stationery business at Bromley, Kent, removed with him in 1837 to a new establishment at Dartford, and a little later took charge of a branch business at Gravesend. Some years after his father's death, in December 1846, he opened a London branch at 140 [[Queen Victoria Street, London|Queen Victoria Street]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=201}}

Dunkin belonged to numerous archæological societies, English and foreign. As an original member of the [[British Archæological Association]], he edited and printed the report of the first general meeting, held at Canterbury in September 1844 (one hundred and fifty copies, octavo, London, Gravesend, printed in 1845), and that of the special general meeting of 5 March 1845 (one hundred and fifty copies, octavo, London, Gravesend, printed in 1845). Again, in 1851 he saw through the press the report of the fifth general meeting, held at Worcester in August 1848. He also edited ''The Archæological Mine, a collection of Antiquarian Nuggets relating to the County of Kent … including the Laws of Kent during the Saxon epoch'', vols. 1–3, octavo, London, 1855 [53–63]. In the belief that he was the original editor, he printed (octavo, ''Noviomago'', 1856) twenty-five copies of the works of Radulphus, abbot of Coggeshall, to which he appended an English translation. An imperfect copy of this unlucky undertaking, with some severe remarks by Sir [[Frederic Madden]], is in the [[British Museum]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=202}}

While travelling in the severe winter of 1878–9, he was seized with bronchitis at Newbury, Berkshire, but managed to get up to London to the house of an old nurse at 110 [[Stamford Street]], [[Blackfriars Road]]. There he died after a few days' illness, 30 January 1879. He was buried in Dartford cemetery, 4 February. 
He was never married. {{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=201}}

==Legacy==
By his will he directed that after the death of his sister and residuary legatee, Miss [[Ellen Elizabeth Dunkin]], his library and collections are to go, under certain conditions, to the [[Guildhall Library]]. 

On failure of such conditions the collections are to be presented to the [[trustees of the British Museum]]; and that the family monuments at Dartford and Bromley may be maintained and renewed when necessary, he left to the lord mayor, the vicars of [[Dartford]] and Bromley, and the principal librarian of the [[British Museum]] freehold estates at [[Stone]], [[Erith]], and [[Bromley]]; ten guineas annually to be spent in a visitation dinner to examine the tombs and memorials ('''Printing Times and Lithographer'', 15 April 1879, page 89).{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=202}}

==Works==
Dunkin had an honest love for antiquities, but his writings contain little that is valuable. 
The lighter essays which he contributed to periodicals, and of which he afterwards reprinted a few copies, are simply inane. 
The following is probably an incomplete list:{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=202}} 
# ''Nundinæ Cantianæ. Some Account of the Chantry of Milton-next-Gravesend, in which is introduced a notice of [[Robert Pocock]], the history of [[Dartford Market]] and Fair, together with remarks on the appointment of Grammar School Feoffees generally'', duodecimo, Dover, 1842 (twelve copies printed). 
# ''Legendæ Cantianæ. William de Eynsford, the excommunicate; a Kentish legend'', octavo, London, 1842 (twenty-five copies printed). 
# ''Nundinæ Floraliæ. Fugitive Papers. May Day, May Games, &amp;c.'', octavo, Dover, 1843 (twelve copies printed). 
# ''Nundinæ Literariæ. Fugitive Papers. Christmas Eve, Christmas, Easter, Whitsuntide, Harvest-Time, and the Morris Dancers'', duodecimo, Dover, 1843 (twelve copies printed). 
# ''The Reign of Lockrin: a poem. Remarks upon modern poetry. Second edition with additions. The History of Lockrin, &amp;c.'', octavo, London, Dartford (printed, 1845). 
# ''Memoranda of Springhead and its neighbourhood during the primeval period'' (without author's name), octavo, London, 1848 (one hundred copies privately printed). 
# ''History of the County of Kent'', 3 vols. octavo, London, 1856–58–55 [–77].

'''Anselm of Liège''' (1008 – c. 1056) was a chronicler of the eleventh century of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]].&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=Anselm of Liège |volume=1 |first=Francis William |last=Grey |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was educated at the episcopal school of [[Liège]], and became canon and dean of the cathedral, where he enjoyed the friendship of the [[bishop of Liège]], [[Wazo]]. His chronicle, regarded as one of the best of the period, both for literary merit and for historical value, is known as the ''Gesta Episcoporum Tungrensium, Trajectensium, et Leodiensium'', and is a continuation of the earlier work by [[Heriger of Lobbes]] (d. 1007) that dealt with the first twenty-seven bishops, from [[Maternus of Cologne|St. Maternus]] (90) to [[Remaclus]] (680). Anselm's work, written at the request of his godmother, the countess Ida, Abbess of [[St. Cecilia, Cologne]], added the lives of twenty-five more bishops, down to [[Wazo of Liège|Wazo]], of whom he gave a very full and particular account.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

The "Gesta" is to be found in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniæ Historica]]'' (''Scriptores'', VII, 161-234; also ''Scriptores'', XIV, 107-120 (1883)). Anselm's style is clear, and his zeal for church reform is equalled by his critical intelligence.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

'''Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora''' (August 14, 1645 &amp;ndash; August 22, 1700) was one of the first great [[intellectual]]s born in the Spanish viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. He was a [[Criollo people|criollo]] patriot, exalting New Spain over Old. A [[polymath]] and writer, he held many colonial government and academic positions.

==Early life==
Sigüenza was born in [[Mexico City]] in 1645 to Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Benito, originally from Madrid, and to Doña Dionisia Suárez de Figueroa y Góngora, born in Seville, Spain, whom the elder Don Carlos met following his arrival New Spain in 1640. Sigüenza was the second oldest and first male of nine siblings. He was related to the famous baroque Spanish poet [[Luis de Góngora]] through his mother. He studied [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]] under the direction of his father, who had been a tutor for the [[Spanish Royal Family|royal family in Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|pp=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expulsion from the Jesuits==
Sigüenza entered the [[Society of Jesus]] as a [[novice]] August 17, 1660, took [[simple vow]]s August 15, 1662 at [[Tepotzotlán]]. But he was dismissed from the Jesuits in 1668, for repeatedly flouting Jesuit discipline and going out secretly at night. He repented and pleaded to be reinstated, but the head of the Jesuits, the General of the Order, rejected his plea, saying "The cause of the expulsion of this person is so disreputable, as he himself confesses, that he does not deserve this boon [of being readmitted]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|p=195}} using the quotation from {{harvp|Leonard|1929}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This dismissal was not only a grave disappointment and a blot on his reputation, but it also meant that he would be financially insecure for the rest of this life. He became a [[Secular_clergy|secular priest]] without a parish or a steady income, so the multiple offices he sought during his lifetime were to support himself and his extended family, all of whom, including his father, were dependent on him to the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained a secular priest in 1673.

==Career in Science==
He studied at the [[Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico]] following his dismissal from the Jesuits, and excelled at mathematics and developed a lifelong interest in the sciences. When a faculty position in Mathematics &amp; Astrology was available, Sigüenza sought to compete for it, although he did not hold a degree in the subjects. It was not clear that he could even be eligible to compete, but Sigüenza argued successfully to do so. Selection for university posts was via ''oposiciones'' or competition between candidates. A question was posed and the candidate had to complete a response within 24 hours to be judged by a panel. Ghost writers or ringers sometimes completed the exercise and Sigüenza successfully argued that his chief rival for the position, and the person who vociferously argued that Sigüenza had no standing to even compete, had to be kept under surveillance during the competition to prevent cheating. On July 20, 1672, he was named to the chair of Mathematics and Astrology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; His record as a professor was marred because he was frequently absent from the classroom due to his researches on various topics and to the pressing of other obligations he took on for fiscal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his biographers suggests that his absences from the university might be attributable to his disdain for astrology, which he considered "a diabolical invention and consequently, alien to science, method, principle and truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|p=198}} quoting from a translation included in {{harvp|Leonard|1929}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1681 Sigüenza wrote the book ''Philosophical Manifest Against the Comets Stripped of their Dominion over the Timid'' in which he tried to dismiss fears of impending superstitious predictions that linked comets to calamitous events; in the work he takes steps to separate the fields of astrology and astronomy. The Tyrolean Jesuit [[Eusebio Kino]], who had come to New Spain to evangelize on the northern frontier, met Sigüenza at his home in Mexico City. Both men had observed the comet of 1680 and both were keenly interested in the phenomenon. The warm feelings between the two soured quickly, with Sigüenza believing that Kino belittled Mexican-born Spaniards' (creoles) level learning. Kino published a strong criticism of Sigüenza's opinion on comets, without naming him specifically. Kino's criticism was that because they were contradictory to established astronomical/astrological belief in the heavens. Sigüenza often cited authors such as Copernicus, Galileo, Descartes, Kepler, and Tycho Brahe. In 1690 Sigüenza moved to defend his previous work by publishing "Libra Astronómica y Filosófica"; it was unlike many of his other writings, which remained in manuscript form because he could not afford to publish them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; He directly attacks Kino by saying "I hereby point out that neither his Reverence [Kino] nor any other mathematician, even if he is [[Ptolemy]] himself, can set up dogmas in these sciences, because authority has no place in them at all, but only proof and demonstration."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theology was known as the "Queen of the Sciences", but Sigüenza's stance is on the side of science as defined in the modern era.

==Royal geographer==
[[Image:Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora.gif|thumb|Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora]]
In the 1680s, he prepared the first-ever map of all of New Spain, which won high praise and was widely copied.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|More|2013|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also drew [[hydrologic]] maps of the [[Valley of Mexico]]. In 1692 King [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] named him official [[geographer]] for the colony. As royal geographer, he participated in the 1692 expedition to [[Pensacola Bay]], [[Florida]] under command of [[Andrés de Pez]], to seek out defensible frontiers against French encroachment. He mapped Pensacola Bay and the mouth of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]: in 1693, he described the terrain in ''Descripción del seno de Santa María de Galve, alias Panzacola, de la Mobila y del Río Misisipi''.

When a Spanish attempt to colonize Pensacola Bay in 1698 was thwarted by the arrival of a French fleet, Sigüenza was blamed by the leader of the expedition, Andrés de Arriola, for inciting the French action. He successfully defended himself against these charges in 1699.

==Other professional pursuits==
In order to supplement his modest salary as a professor, he took on a number of other posts. He was chaplain of the Hospital del Amor de Dios (now Academia de San Carlos) from 1682 until his death. This post provided him with living quarters, which given his strapped financial circumstances was a major benefit. It also was a steady income from celebrating masses for a fixed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as Chief Almoner for the Archbishop of Mexico, Don Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas, distributing alms to poor women, a charity the "misogynistic prelate could not abide."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigüenza not only pursued his interests in science, but he was also a poet, non-fiction writer, [[historian]], [[philosopher]], [[cartographer]], and [[cosmographer]] of the realm. Such was his prestige that the French King [[Louis XIV]] tried to induce him to come to [[Paris]]. He published his first poem in 1662. From 1671 to 1701 (posthumous) he published a yearly almanac. A. Margarita Peraza-Rugeley has studied the surviving almanacs in her 2013 book.&lt;ref&gt;Peraza-Rugeley, A. Margarita ''Llámenme el mexicano: Los almanaques y otras obras de Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora.'' New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2013. Currents in Comparative Romance Languages and Literatures Series. Vol. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1690 Sigüenza published a pirate captivity narrative which has been considered Latin America's first novel, ''Los infortunios de Alonso Ramírez''. However, new archival evidence discovered by Fabio López Lázaro (2007, 2011), [https://web.archive.org/web/20140221213903/http://caribbeanstudies.buffalo.edu/jose-f-buscaglia/ José F. Buscaglia-Salgado] (2009, 2011), and A. Margarita Peraza-Rugeley (2013) proves that this incredible story of a Puerto Rican taken captive by English pirates off the Philippine Islands is a historical account, not a fictional one. The archival documents contain dozens of eyewitness accounts corroborating not only the existence of Ramírez, his marriage in Mexico City, and also his capture in 1687, his life with pirates (most notably [[William Dampier]]), his collaboration with them, and his return to Mexico in 1690, at which time Spanish colonial authorities suspected Alonso of piracy.&lt;ref name="estudiosamericanos"&gt;{{harvp|López Lázaro|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|López Lázaro|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sigüenza y Góngora|first=Carlos de|title=Infortunios de Alonso Ramírez: Edición crítica de José F. Buscaglia|year=2011|publisher=Polifemo/Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas|location=Madrid|isbn=978-84-00-09365-5|url=http://www.polifemo.com/ficha_libro.php?isbn=9788496813595|edition=José F. Buscaglia Salgado}}&lt;/ref&gt; López Lázaro was the first to discover archival evidence (published in 2007) for the historical existence of Ramírez, his meeting with the Viceroy of New Spain, and the writing of ''Los infortunios'' in 1690.&lt;ref name="estudiosamericanos"/&gt; Buscaglia corroborated the existence of Alonso Ramírez as a true historical figure in 2009, citing his marriage certificate and pinpointing with exactitude, after two expeditions to the coast of Bacalar, the site of his shipwreck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sigüenza y Góngora|first=Carlos de|title=Historias del Seno Mexicano|year=2009|publisher=Casa de las Américas|location=Havana, Cuba|isbn=978-959-260-274-8|edition=José Francisco Buscaglia Salgado,}}&lt;/ref&gt; López Lázaro's and Buscaglia's studies are the most significant findings in more than a century of scholarship on the book. The new archival evidence leaves no room to doubt that Sigüenza's key role in creating ''Los infortunios de Alonso Ramírez'' was in editing Alonso's coarse narrative into a superior literary piece. According to López Lázaro's analysis, the book was commissioned by the Spanish administration during [[League of Augsburg|the war]] against [[Louis XIV]] to solidify Madrid's commitment to the struggle against French colonial rivals and their buccaneer collaborators but also to warn them about Spain's unreliable English and Dutch allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|López Lázaro|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Friendship with Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz==
[[File:Sor Juana by Miguel Cabrera.png|thumb|left|Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, posthumous painting by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]].]]
Seventeenth-century Mexico City had two savants, Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora and Doña Juana Inés de Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana, known to posterity as the Hieronymite nun, [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]]. It is unclear at what point the two made their acquaintance, but they lived a short distance away from each other, he in the Amor de Dios Hospital and she in the convent where she had taken vows following a time spent in the viceregal court. Although Sor Juana was cloistered, the Hieronymite order followed a more relaxed rule and nuns could have visitors in the ''locutorio'' or special room for conversation in the convent. Known as the "Tenth Muse", she was a formidable intellect and poet, and was encouraged in her scientific studies by Sigüenza. Each was well known in circles of power and with the arrival of the new viceroy to New Spain, each was tapped to design a triumphal arch to welcome him, a signal honor to them both. Sor Juana's final years were extremely difficult ones, and when she died in 1695, Sigüenza delivered the eulogy at her funeral. The text of that address is now lost, but in 1680 he had praised her, "There is no pen that can rise to the eminence that hers o'ertops...[the fame of] Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz will only end with the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|pp=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ixtlilxochitl-Sigüenza-Boturini collection==
Sigüenza had a strong interest in the indigenous past of Mexico and began learning [[Nahuatl]] following his dismissal from the Jesuits in 1668. He collected books and other materials related to indigenous culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Hospital de Amor de Dioas Sigüenza became a close friend of Don Juan, the son of indigenous nobleman Don Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, (1587?-1650).&lt;ref&gt;Edmundo O'Gorman, ''Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl'', introductory material to ''Obras históricas, Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl. Tomo 1.'' Mexico: Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, 1975, pp. 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Sigüenza helped Alva Ixtlilxochitl's on Don Juan de Alva with a lawsuit against Spaniards attempting to usurp his holdings near the great pyramids at San Juan Teotihuacan. Don Juan in gratitude for Sigüenza's aid, gifted him the manuscripts and codices of his historian father, Don Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|pp=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a rich collection of documents of his royal ancestors and the kings of [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]]. In 1668, Sigüenza began the study of Aztec history and Toltec writing. On the death of Alva Ixtlilxochitl in 1650, he inherited the collection of documents, and devoted the later years of his life to the continuous study of [[History of Mexico|Mexican history]]. When Sigüenza made his will shortly before his death, he was very concerned about the fate of his library, since its "collection has cost me great pains and care, and a considerable sum of money."&lt;ref&gt;translation by and quoted in {{harvp|More|2013|p=254}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His original intention was to have his library transferred to European repositories, including the Vatican and the Escorial, and to library of the duke of Florence, but in the end he willed them to the College of San Pedro and San Pablo.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|More|2013|pp=255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly concerned about the native materials in his collection. For an account of what happened to these documents after the death of Sigüenza, see [[Lorenzo Boturini Bernaducci]].

==The Virgin of Guadalupe==
[[File:Virgen de guadalupe1.jpg|thumb|right|Virgin of Guadalupe]]
Sigüenza wrote ''Indian Spring'' whose full title in Spanish is ''Primavera indiana, poema sacrohistórico, idea de María Santíssima de Guadalupe'' (1662). The work contributed to the midseventeenth-century outpouring of writings on the Virgin of Guadalupe. Sigüenza wrote in praise of Guadalupe, especially her role in aiding creole patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Poole|1997|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these documents was purported to be a "map" ([[Aztec codices|codex]]) documenting the 1531 [[Marian apparition|apparition]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] that Luis Becerra Tanco claimed to have seen in the introduction to his 1666 defense of the apparition tradition. Sigüenza writings on Guadalupe were not extensive, but he encouraged Becerra Tanco and Francisco de Florencia to pursue the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brading|1991|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his association with these early documents, Sigüenza played a significant role in the development of the Guadalupe story. He was a devotee of the Virgin, and wrote [[Parnassian]] poems to her as early as 1662. But his most lasting impact on the history of the apparition was his assertion that the ''[[Nican mopohua]]'', the [[Nahuatl]]-language rendition of the narrative, was written by [[Antonio Valeriano]], a conception that persists to this day. He further identified Fernando Alva de Ixtlilxochitl as the author of the ''[[Nican motecpana]]''. This declaration was stimulated by Francisco de Florencia's ''Polestar of Mexico'', which claimed that the original Nahuatl account had been written by Franciscan Fray [[Jerónimo de Mendieta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Poole|1997|pp=166–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creole patriotism and the triumphal arch to welcome the viceroy in 1680==
[[File:CondeDeParedes.jpg|thumb|left|Viceroy [[Tomás de la Cerda, 3rd Marquis of la Laguna|Tomás de la Cerda]]]]
In 1680, he was commissioned to design a [[triumphal arch]] for the arrival of the new [[Viceroy of New Spain|Viceroy]], [[Tomás de la Cerda, 3rd Marquis of la Laguna|Cerda y Aragón]]. Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz was commissioned to design the only other one, which were erected in the Plaza de Santo Domingo, near the main square or Zócalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Paz|1988|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; No image of the triumphal arches is known to be extant, but both Sigüenza and Sor Juana wrote descriptions of the works. Sigüenza's work was entitled ''Theater of Political Virtues That Constitute a Ruler, Observed in the Ancient Monarchs of the Mexican Empire, Whose Effigies Adorn the Arch Erected by the Very Noble Imperial City of Mexico.'' Sigüenza's title was meant to convey to the new viceroy that his tenure in office was in a long line of Mexican monarchs. On the arch were images of all twelve Aztec rulers, "each taken to embody different political virtues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brading|1991|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also represented was the god Huitzilopochtli, whom Sigüenza claimed was not a deity but a "chieftain and leader of Mexicans in the voyage that by his command was undertaken in search of the provinces of Anahuac."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{harvp|Paz|1988|p=152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sigüenza's gigantic wooden arch (90 feet high, fifty feet wide) was a manifestation of creole patriotism that embraced the florescence of the Aztecs as a source of their own pride in their patria. He hoped that "on some occasion the Mexican monarchs might be reborn from the ashes to which oblivion had consigned them, so that, like Western phoenixes, they may be immortalized by fame" and be recognized as having "heroic ... imperial virtues."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{harvp|Brading|1991|p=362}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sigüenza praised the arch that Sor Juana had designed, but hers took the theme of Neptune in fable and did not manifest any explicit theme "contribut[ing] to the growth of creole patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brading|1991|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas about the ancient Mexicans==
[[File:Description_De_Mexico_et_des_Lagunes_De_Ses_Environs_Gemelli_Careri.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Mexico and the central lake system by Italian traveler [[Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri]] from one by Sigüenza y Góngora.]] 
Sigüenza's ideas about the ancient Mexicans were informed by the hugely valuable manuscripts from Alva Ixtlilxochitl, but he also developed ideas of his own about the origin of the Mexicans. He was one of the first persons, during Spanish rule, to dig around the Pyramid of the Sun at [[Teotihuacan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.milenio.com/node/501242 Tunnel under Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent under exploration in 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He took Italian traveler [[Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri]] to that ancient site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brading|1991|p=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigüenza's ideas about the origins of the ancient Mexicans were influenced by German Jesuit [[Athanasius Kircher]], who saw ancient Egypt as the source of all natural wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brading|1991|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigüenza embraced Kircher's ideas and in the publication accompanying his triumphal arch for the arrival of the new viceroy, ''Theater of Political Virtues That Constitute a Ruler'', "he boldly pronounced that the Mexican Indians were the descendants of the Naphtuhim, the son of Misraim, founder and ruler of Egypt," and further asserted that Naphtuhim was a variation on the name Neptune, the ruler of Atlantis, populated by Egyptian colonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brading|1991|p=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; In advocating an Egyptian origin for the ancient Mexicans, he rejects [[Franciscan]] [[fray Juan de Torquemada]]'s dismissal of that theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brading|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigüenza, also as opposed to Torquemada, believed that St Thomas the Apostle evangelized Mexico and identified him with Quetzalcoatl. He gave notice that a pamphlet entitled ''Phoenix of the West.

==1692 Mexico City riot==
[[File:Vista de la Plaza Mayor de la Ciudad de México - Cristobal de Villalpando.jpg|thumb|''View of the Plaza Mayor of Mexico City'' (1695) by [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]]. The viceroy's palace still shows the damage done during the 1692 riot.]]
Considering the small proportion of the Spanish population in Mexico as opposed to the Indian and mixed-race [[casta]] populations and that the fact that there had been few challenges to Spanish rule since the early sixteenth-century conquest, likely meant the huge riot on June 8, 1692 was a shock to Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brading|1991|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mob of Indians and castas partially destroyed the viceregal palace and the building of the city council (''cabildo'' or ''ayuntamiento''). Painter [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]]'s 1696 painting of the Zócalo still shows the damage to the viceregal palace from the mob's attempt to burn it down. Sigüenza wrote a lengthy "racy, vivid account of the riot...he also offered a fascinating profile of his own reactions to the dramatic events."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brading|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a major source for the Spanish version of events, published as "Letter of Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora to Admiral Pez Recounting the incidents of the Corn Riot in Mexico City, June 8 1692."&lt;ref&gt;In Don Carlos Sigüenza y Góngora, "Letter of Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora to Admiral Pez Recounting the incidents of the Corn Riot in Mexico City, June 8 1692," In {{harvp|Leonard|1929|pp=210–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1692, there was a severe drought in New Spain and a disease attacking wheat, called in Nahuatl "chiahuiztli". The crown sought sources of corn outside the general sourcing area for the capital, but the price of corn rose significantly. This caused a severe shortage of food for the poor. Tensions rose significantly in the capital, and came to a flashpoint when neither the viceroy nor the archbishop, to whom the crowd of petitioners appealed as legitimate authorities, would meet directly with them. Following the failed attempt to get any official audience or promise of aid, the crowd began throwing stones and set fire to the major buildings around the capital's principal square. Sigüenza saved most of the documents and some paintings in the [[archives]], at the risk of his own life. This act preserved a considerable number of colonial Mexican documents that would otherwise have been lost. Scholars have noted the importance of the 1692 riot in Mexican history.&lt;ref&gt;R. Douglas Cope, ''The Limits of Racial Domination: Plebeian Society in Colonial Mexico City, 1660-1720'', Madison: University of Wisconsin Press 1994, especially chapter 7 "The Riot of 1692".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brading|1991|pp=370–371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career and death==
In 1693, he (along with Admiral Andrés de Pez y Malzarraga), set sail from [[Veracruz, Mexico]] and discovered the [[East Bay River]] of [[Florida]] and the land where the city of [[Navarre, Florida|Navarre]] is now located.

In 1694, he retired from the University. His final years were marked by even more financial and personal troubles. He became ill, with what physicians identified as either gallstones or kidney stones and he was in considerable pain. His patron the Archbishop Aguiar y Seijas died and Sigüenza lost his lucrative post of Chief Almoner. He also lost the position of University Accountant. The death of his patron the Archbishop was clustered with the death of Sigüenza's father and favorite brother. His dear friend Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz died and he delivered the eulogy at her funeral. In November 1699, Sigüenza was named ''corregidor general'' (book examiner) for the [[Inquisition]], a position that paid little and which took up considerable time vetting books for possible heresy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his health deteriorated in these circumstances, Sigüenza prepared for the eventuality of his death, which came in 1700. A scientist to the end, he requested that his body be autopsied, so that physicians could determine what had afflicted him. He explicitly laid out the reasons and concerned that this radical step might be opposed on religious or other grounds by his relatives, he said "I ask in God's name that this [autopsy] be done for the common good, and I command my heir not to interfere, for it matters little that this be done to a body which, within a few days, must be corruption and decay."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|p=214}} quoting his translation found in {{harvp|Leonard|1929}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The autopsy revealed a kidney stone the size of a peach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigüenza left his library and scientific instruments to the Jesuit [[San Pedro y San Pablo College, Mexico City|Colegio Máximo de San Pedro y San Pablo]] in Mexico City. He was buried at the chapel of this Colegio, which could point to his having been reconciled with the Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leonard|1959|p=196}} Leonard says "Whether a deathbed reconciliation fulfilled remains uncertain", suggesting that documentary evidence is absent.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Poole|1997|p=165}} also doubted that Sigüenza was readmitted to the Jesuits.&lt;/ref&gt; He also left a number of unpublished manuscripts, only fragments of which survived the expulsion of the Society of Jesus from the viceroyalty in 1767.

A '''Century Farm''' or '''Centennial Farm''' is a [[farm]] or [[ranching|ranch]] in the United States or Canada that has been officially recognized by a regional program documenting the farm has been continuously owned by a single family for 100 years or more. Some regions also have '''Sesquicentennial Farm''' (150 years) and '''Bicentennial Farm''' (200 years) programs.

In most states and provinces, the essential requirement for the award is that the property must have remained in the same family continuously for 100 years or more and currently be a working farm or ranch.&lt;ref name=Colorado&gt;[http://www.historycolorado.org/archaeologists/centennial-farms Colorado Centennial Farms]&lt;/ref&gt; Some states stipulate a minimum number of acres or annual agricultural sales.&lt;ref name=Colorado/&gt;

==Background==

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], Century Farm recognition in the province of [[Ontario]] was initiated as a Canadian Centennial project of the Junior Farmers' Association of Ontario  (JFAO) in 1967.&lt;ref name=Ontario&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jfao.on.ca/centuryfarmsigns/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122214237/http://www.jfao.on.ca/centuryfarmsigns/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-01-22 |title=The Century Farm Sign Project |publisher=Junior Farmers' Association of Ontario |accessdate=2010-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Alberta the Alberta Century Farm &amp; Ranch Award is administered by the [[Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development|Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/general/progserv.nsf/all/pgmsrv51|title=Alberta Century Farm &amp; Ranch Award|author=Government of Alberta, Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development|work=gov.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar programs are run by individual counties and municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mdwainwright.ca/asb/farmfamilyawards.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], one of the first organizations to begin officially recognizing the farms was the New York State Agricultural Society in 1937. Several states began their programs during the [[United States Bicentennial]] in 1976.  Recognition from state to state varies.  It is usually handled by the state's agriculture or natural resources department in conjunction with the [[American Farm Bureau Federation]] and the [[Cooperative extension service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], or the state's historical society. In other states, civic groups such as the [[Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben]] perform the function.  The awards are frequently done at the [[state fair]].

The award typically defines a farm as {{convert|40|acre}} or more and consists of a plaque and a sign as well as formal listing.

In Oregon, in addition to century farms and ranches, the [[Oregon Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] began to recognize [[Anniversary#Latin-derived numerical names|sesquicentennial]] farms and ranches in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregon.gov/ODA/cfr.shtml#Congratulations_to_the_2009_Sesquicentennial_Award_honorees |title=Congratulations to the 2009 Sesquicentennial Award honorees |publisher=[[Oregon Department of Agriculture]] |accessdate=2010-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217021306/http://www.oregon.gov/ODA/cfr.shtml#Congratulations_to_the_2009_Sesquicentennial_Award_honorees |archivedate=2009-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kittuwa-mound-cherokee-nc1.jpg|thumb|[[Kituwa|Kituwa Mound]], location of the Cherokee mother town in [[North Carolina]]]]

'''Cherokee history''' draws upon the [[oral tradition]]s and [[recorded history|written history]] of the [[Cherokee]] people, who are currently enrolled in the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], [[Cherokee Nation]], and [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians]], living predominantly in [[North Carolina]] and [[Oklahoma]].

==Origins==

[[File:Smoky Mtn View.jpg|thumb|500px|[[Great Smoky Mountains]]]]

The Cherokee are an [[Iroquois language]]-family Indian tribe. Their origins are not clearly known, but they are believed to have originated in the Great Lakes region, as all documented Iroquois tribes did.  The Cherokee were first encountered by settlers in the southeastern United States.  Exactly when they arrived was uncertain.  Nineteenth century whites believed that the Cherokee were autochthonous, but this was due to misconceptions about Indian tribes and a lack of attention to the historical record.

It is known that the Cherokee did not yet live in the southeastern United States in 1540, at the time of the [[Hernando de Soto]] expedition.  Instead, the region was inhabited by several mound-building groups that were described in detail in the expedition records.  These Indians were the [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]] and a chiefdom owing allegiance to [[Tuskaloosa]], who were both part of the future [[Muscogee Creek]] confederacy tribes.  Also described were the mound-building [[Chicsa]] or [[Yuchi]].  Both terms are used, as if they are interchangeable, and the language of the Yuchi people has been documented and determined to be a language isolate unrelated to any other Indian language.  The expedition also described the mound town of [[Joara]], which may have been Muscogee Creek, as well.  The Cherokee were not yet in the region when [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] left in 1568, either, nor were they encountered in the wide travels of [[John Lederer]] in 1669 and 1670.

However, the tribes that had been in the Carolina piedmont encountered by de Soto and Lederer were extinct by the 1720s, and instead, the European settlers encountered the Iroquoian Tuscarora people, who had moved in from Virginia under the dual pressures of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] and English settlers, and the Cherokee tribes, who must have migrated from the west in that time.

Though the Cherokee were well established at the southern end of the [[Great Appalachian Valley]] by the 1720s, having displaced the Muscogee Creek and other tribes,&lt;ref name=ecc&gt;Brown, John P. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v016/v016p003.html "Eastern Cherokee Chiefs."] ''Chronicles of Oklahoma.'' Vol. 16, No. 1, March 1938. (retrieved 21 Sept 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; non-Cherokee villages were not completely exterminated from Eastern Tennessee as late as the [[Long Hunter]] expeditions of the 1760s, who encountered Yuchi and Siouan traders and villages only to find them wiped out later and replaced by roving Cherokee hunting parties by the 1780s. The aggressive expansion of the Iroquois Confederacy southward and the simultaneous push of the Cherokee people northward far in excess of their rates of population growth cleared large sections of the central eastern United States of most inhabitants, facilitating the rapid settlement by Europeans.

Several [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] sites have been misattributed to the Cherokee, including [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah Mounds]] but are in fact Muscogee Creek. [[Pisgah Phase]] sites nave some similarities with later Cherokee culture, and historic Cherokee villages featured artifacts with iconography from the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]], but this is most likely due to the assimilation of the survivors of the Cherokee expansion.

Corn was central to several religious ceremonies of the Cherokee, especially the [[Green Corn Ceremony]], a tradition shared with other Iroquois-language tribes, as well as the Creek, [[Choctaw]], Yuchi, and [[Seminole]].

A Cherokee myth recorded in the late 18th century speaks of a "[[Moon-eyed people]]" who had lived in the Cherokee regions before they arrived. The group was described in 1797 by Colonel Leonard Marbury to [[Benjamin Smith Barton]]. According to Marbury, when the Cherokee arrived in the area they had encountered a "moon-eyed" people who could not see in the day-time.&lt;ref name = "bart"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barton|first=Benjamin Smith|title=New views of the origin of the tribes and nations of America|year=1797|page=xliv|url=https://archive.org/stream/newviewsoforigin00bartarch#page/xliv/mode/2up/search/albino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early culture==
[[File:Cherokee original claims1.PNG|thumb|left|Prior to the 17th century, Cherokees lived in western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee]]

Much of what is known about pre-19th century Cherokee culture and society comes from the papers of American writer [[John Howard Payne]]. The Payne papers describe the account by Cherokee elders of a traditional societal structure in which a "white" organization of elders represented the seven clans. According to Payne, this group, which was hereditary and described as priestly, was responsible for religious activities such as healing, purification, and prayer. A second group of younger men, the "red" organization, was responsible for warfare. Warfare was considered a polluting activity, which required the purification of the priestly class before participants could reintegrate into normal village life. This hierarchy had disappeared long before the 18th century. The reasons for the change have been debated, with the origin of the decline often located with a revolt by the Cherokee against the abuses of the priestly class known as the [[Ani-kutani]] ("Aní-" is a prefix referring to a group of individuals, while the meaning of "kutáni" is unknown).&lt;ref name="Who Were the Aní-Kutánî?"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=482712 |title=Who Were the Aní-Kutánî? An Excursion into Cherokee Historical Thought |volume=31 |pages=255–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Irwina-1992"&gt;Irwin 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnographer [[James Mooney]], who studied the Cherokee in the late 1880s, first traced the decline of the former hierarchy to this revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Mooney, the structure of Cherokee religious practitioners was more informal, based more on individual knowledge and ability than upon heredity.&lt;ref name = "Irwina-1992"/&gt;

Another major source of early cultural history comes from materials written in the 19th century by the ''didanvwisgi'' (Cherokee:ᏗᏓᏅᏫᏍᎩ), Cherokee [[Medicine man|medicine men]], after [[Sequoyah]]'s creation of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] in the 1820s. Initially only the didanvwisgi used these materials, which were considered extremely powerful.&lt;ref name = "Irwina-1992"/&gt;  Later, the writings were widely adopted by the Cherokee people.

Unlike most other Indians in the American southeast at the start of the historic era, the Cherokee spoke an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language]]. Since the [[Great Lakes]] region was the core of Iroquoian language speakers, scholars have theorized that the Cherokee migrated south from that region. However, some argue that the Iroquois migrated north from the southeast, with the Tuscarora breaking off from that group during the migration.  Linguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting a split in the distant past.&lt;ref name="mooney"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mooney | first = James | authorlink = James Mooney | title = Myths of the Cherokee | origyear = 1900 | year = 1995 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | isbn = 0-486-28907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glottochronology]] studies suggest the split occurred between about 1,500 and 1,800 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Glottochronology from: Lounsbury, Floyd (1961), and Mithun, Marianne (1981), cited in [http://www.famsi.org/research/hopkins/SouthEastUSLanguages.pdf Nicholas A. Hopkins, ''The Native Languages of the Southeastern United States''].&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient settlement of [[Kituwa]] on the [[Tuckasegee River]], formerly next to and now part of [[Qualla Boundary]] (the reservation of the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]]), is often cited as the original Cherokee settlement in the Southeast.&lt;ref name="mooney"/&gt;

==16th century: Spanish contact==
The first known Cherokee contact with Europeans was in late May 1540, when a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] passed through Cherokee country near present-day [[Embreeville, Tennessee]], which the Spaniards referred to as ''Guasili''.&lt;ref name="Hudson1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Hudson|title=Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun: Hernando de Soto and the South's Ancient Chiefdoms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWJnGjxjJk8C|accessdate=24 August 2013|year=1998|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2062-5|pages=190–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Soto's expedition visited many of the Georgia and Tennessee villages later identified as Cherokee, but recorded them as then ruled by the [[Coosa chiefdom]], while a ''Chalaque'' nation was recorded as living around the [[Keowee River]] where North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia meet.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases brought by the Spaniards and their animals decimated the Cherokee and other Eastern tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

A second Spanish expedition came through Cherokee country in 1567 led by [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]]. Spanish troops built six forts in the interior southeast. They visited the Cherokee towns [[Nikwasi]], Estatoe, [[Tugaloo]], Conasauga, and [[Kituwa]], but ultimately failed to gain dominion over the region and retreated to the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century: English contact===
[[File:Chiefs from Carolina.jpg|thumb|left|These Cherokee accompanied [[:s:Cuming, Alexander (DNB00)|Sir Alexander Cumming]] to England in 1730.]]

The first Anglo-Cherokee contact may have been in 1656, when English settlers in [[Virginia Colony]] recorded that six to seven hundred "''Mahocks, [[Nahyssan]]s and Rechahecrians''" had encamped at Bloody Run, now on the eastern edge of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. They were driven off by a combined force of English and tributary [[Pamunkey]], but the Pamunkey chief [[Totopotomoi]] was slain in the battle. While the first two named groups are considered to be [[Virginia Siouan]], the identity of the ''Rechahecrians'' has been much debated.  Historians have noted that the name closely resembles that of the ''Eriechronon'', commonly known as the [[Erie tribe]], an Iroquoian people who had been driven away from the southern shore of [[Lake Erie]] in 1654 during the [[Beaver Wars]] by the powerful [[Iroquois]] Five Nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chattanoogan.com/2016/1/21/316430/Lost-Nation-of-the-Erie-Part-1.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[anthropologist]] Martin Smith theorized that remnants of the Erie migrated to Virginia after the wars ([[#refSmith1987|1986:131–32]]), and a few historians have even suggested that this tribe was identical with the Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;Conley, ''A Cherokee Encyclopedia'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Erie language]] is too scarcely attested to firmly place its relationship to Cherokee or other Iroquoian languages.

In 1673, two Englishmen, James Needham and Gabriel Arthur were sent to Overhill Cherokee county in 1673 by fur-trader [[Abraham Wood]] from Fort Henry (modern [[Petersburg, Virginia]]). Wood hoped to forge a direct trading connection with the Cherokee to bypass the [[Occaneechi]] Indians, who were serving as middlemen on the [[Trading Path]]. The two colonial Virginians probably did make contact with the Cherokees. Wood called them ''Rickohockens'' in his book on the expedition. The map accompanying the book, showed the Rickohockens occupying all of present-day southwestern Virginia, southeastern Kentucky, northwestern North Carolina and the northeastern tip of Tennessee.

Needham departed with a guide nicknamed 'Indian John' while Arthur was left behind to learn the Cherokee language. On his journey, Needham engaged in an argument with 'Indian John', resulting in his death. 'Indian John' then tried to encourage his tribe to kill Arthur but the chief prevented this. Arthur, disguised as a Cherokee, accompanied the chief of the Cherokee tribe at Chota on raids of Spanish settlements in Florida, Indian communities on the east coast, and Shawnee towns on the Ohio River. However, in 1674 he was captured by the Shawnee Indians who discovered that under his disguise of clay and ash he was a white man. The Shawnee did not kill Arthur but alternatively allowed him to return to Chota. In June 1674, the chief escorted Arthur back to his English settlement in Virginia. By the late 17th century, colonial traders from both Virginia and South Carolina were making regular journeys to Cherokee lands, but few wrote about their experiences.

The character and events of the early trading contact period have been pieced together by historians' examination of records of colonial laws and lawsuits involving traders. The trade was mainly [[Deerskin trade|deerskins]], raw material for the booming European leather industry, in exchange for European technology "trade goods", such as iron and steel tools (kettles, knives, etc.), firearms, gunpowder, and ammunition. In 1705, traders complained that their business had been lost and replaced by Indian slave trade instigated by [[James Moore (South Carolina politician)|Governor James Moore]] of South Carolina. Moore had commissioned people to "set upon, assault, kill, destroy, and take captive as many Indians as possible". When the captives were sold, traders split profits with the Governor.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Although colonial governments early prohibited selling alcohol to Indians, traders commonly used rum, and later whiskey, as common items of trade.&lt;ref name="drake"&gt;{{cite book |last= Drake |first= Richard B. |title= A History of Appalachia |year= 2001 |publisher= University Press of Kentucky |isbn= 0-8131-2169-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early historic era, Europeans wrote of several Cherokee town groups, usually using the terms Lower, Middle, and [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill]] towns to designate the towns, from the Piedmont across the Allegheny Mountains. The Lower Towns were situated on the headwater streams of the [[Savannah River]], mainly in present-day western [[South Carolina]] and northeastern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  ''[[Keowee]]'' was one of the chief towns, as was ''[[Tugaloo]]''.

The Middle Towns were located in present western [[North Carolina]], on the headwater streams of the [[Tennessee River]], such as the upper [[Little Tennessee River]], upper [[Hiwassee River]], and upper [[French Broad River]]. Among several chief towns were ''[[Nikwasi]]'' and ''[[Joara]]'', first recorded in the late 16th century during Spanish settlement there with the establishment of Fort San Juan.

The Overhill Towns were located across the higher mountains in present eastern [[Tennessee]] and northwestern Georgia. Principal towns included [[Chota (Cherokee town)|''Chota'']], [[Great Tellico|''Tellico'']], and ''[[Tanasi]]''. These terms were created and used by Europeans to describe their changing geopolitical relationship with the Cherokee.&lt;ref name="mooney"/&gt;

There were two more groups of towns often listed as part of the three: the Out Towns, whose chief town was ''Kituwa'' on the Tuckaseegee River, considered the mother town of all Cherokee; and the Valley Towns, whose chief town was ''Tomotley'' on the Valley River (not the same as the [[Tomotley]] on the [[Little Tennessee River]]). The former shared the dialect of the Middle Towns and the latter that of the Overhill (later Upper) Towns.

Of the southeastern Indian confederacies of the late 17th and early 18th centuries (Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw, etc.), the Cherokee were one of the most populous and powerful. They were relatively isolated by their hilly and mountainous homeland. A small-scale trading system was established with Virginia in the late 17th century. In the 1690s, the Cherokee had founded a much stronger and important trade relationship with the colony of South Carolina, based in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charles Town]]. By the 18th century, this overshadowed the Virginia relationship.&lt;ref name="gallay"&gt;{{cite book |last= Gallay |first= Alan |title= The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South 1670–1717 |year= 2002 |publisher= Yale University Press |isbn= 0-300-10193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three Cherokee.jpg|thumb|left|Three Cherokee diplomats in London, 1765]]

The Cherokees gave sanctuary to a band of Shawnee in the 1660s, but from 1710 to 1715 the Cherokee and Chickasaw, allied with the British, fought Shawnee, who were allied with the French, and forced them to move north.&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Rozema, ''Footsteps of the Cherokees'' (1995), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Cherokees fought, along with the [[Yamasee]], [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]], and British in late 1712 and early 1713, against the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] in the Second [[Tuscarora War]]. The aftermath of this Tuscarora War marked the migration of most of the tribe to New York, eventually to become the 6th Nation in the [[League of the Iroquois]] and in the South, the beginning of an English-Cherokee relationship that, despite breaking down on occasion, remained strong for much of the 18th century.

In January 1716, a delegation of Muscogee Creek leaders was murdered at the Cherokee town of [[Tugaloo (Cherokee town)|Tugaloo]], marking the Cherokee's entry into the [[Yamasee War]], which ended in 1717 with peace treaties between [[South Carolina]] and the Creeks. Hostility and sporadic raids between the Cherokee and Creek continued for decades.&lt;ref name="oatis"&gt;Oatis, Steven J. ''A Colonial Complex: South Carolina's Frontiers in the Era of the Yamasee War, 1680–1730.'' Lincoln, University of Nebraska Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8032-3575-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These raids came to a head at the [[Battle of Taliwa]] in 1755 (in present-day [[Ball Ground, Georgia]]) resulting in the defeat of the Muscogee.

In 1721, the Cherokee ceded lands to [[South Carolina]]. In 1730, at [[Nikwasi]], a manipulative Britain, Sir Alexander Cumming, convinced Cherokees to crown [[Moytoy of Tellico]] as "Emperor." Moytoy agreed to recognize King [[George II of Great Britain]] as the Cherokee protector. Seven prominent Cherokee, including [[Attakullakulla]], traveled with Cuming back to [[London, England]]. The Cherokee delegation signed the [[Treaty of Whitehall]] with the British. Moytoy's son, Amo-sgasite (Dreadful Water) attempted to succeed him as "Emperor" in 1741, but the Cherokees elected their own leader, [[Conocotocko I|Old Hop]] of [[Chota (Cherokee town)|Chota]] (or, sometimes, Echota).&lt;ref name="ecc"/&gt;

Political power among Cherokees remained decentralized with towns acting autonomously. In 1735 the Cherokee were estimated to have sixty-four towns and villages and 6000 fighting men. A significant interaction between European and American peoples was embodied in the assimilation of [[Gottlieb Priber]] into Cherokee society, a German radical who advocated for a trans-tribal region-wide Indian confederation to oppose European colonization of Native land. In 1738 and 1739 [[smallpox]] epidemics broke out among the Cherokee, who had no natural immunity. Nearly half their population died within a year. Many —possibly hundreds —of the Cherokee people also committed suicide due to disfigurement from the disease.

From 1753 to 1755, battles broke out between the Cherokee and Muscogee over disputed hunting grounds in [[North Georgia]]. Cherokees were victorious in the Battle of Taliwa. British soldiers built forts in Cherokee country to confront the French, including [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loudoun]], near Chota. In 1756 the Cherokees fought alongside the British in the [[French and Indian War]]; however, serious misunderstandings between the two allies arose quickly, resulting in the 1760 [[Anglo-Cherokee War]]. The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] issued by King George III forbade British settlements west of the Appalachian crest, attempting to afford some temporary protection from colonial [[wikt:Special:Search/encroachment|encroachment]] to the Cherokee, but it proved difficult to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;Rozema, pp. 17–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1769–72, predominantly Virginian settlers squatting on Cherokee lands in Tennessee, formed the [[Watauga Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/98/entry "Watauga Association".] ''North Carolina History Project.'' (retrieved 21 Sept 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kentucky|"Kentuckee"]], [[Daniel Boone]] and his party tried to create a settlement in what would become the [[Transylvania colony]], but the Shawnee, [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Mingo]], and some disgruntled Cherokee attacked a scouting and foraging party that included Boone's son. This sparked the beginning of what was known as [[Dunmore's War]] (1773–1774).

In 1776, allied with the Shawnee and led by [[Cornstalk]], Cherokees attacked settlers in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] and North Carolina in the [[Cherokee–American wars#The Second Cherokee War|Second Cherokee War]]. An Overhill Cherokee, [[Nancy Ward]] (a niece of [[Dragging Canoe]]), warned settlers of the impending aggression. European-American militias retaliated, destroying over 50 Cherokee towns. In 1777, most of the surviving Cherokee town leaders signed treaties with the states.

Dragging Canoe and his band, however, moved to the area near present-day [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], establishing 11 new towns. Chickamauga was his headquarters and his entire band was known as the Chickamaugas. From here he fought a [[guerrilla]]-style war, the [[Cherokee–American wars]]. The Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse, signed 7 November 1794, ended the Cherokee–American wars.

==19th century==
[[File:Tahchee.jpg|thumb|Tah-Chee (Dutch), A Cherokee Chief, 1837.  Published in [[History of the Indian Tribes of North America]].]]

The Cherokees organized a national government led by Principal Chiefs [[Little Turkey]] (1788–1801), [[Black Fox (Cherokee chief)|Black Fox]] (1801–1811), and [[Pathkiller]] (1811–1827).

The seat of the Upper Towns was at Ustanali (near [[Calhoun, Georgia]]), also the titular seat of the Nation, and with the former warriors James Vann and his protégés [[Major Ridge|The Ridge]] (formerly known as Pathkiller) and [[Charles R. Hicks]], the "Cherokee Triumvirate", as their dominant leaders, particularly of the younger more acculturated generation. The leaders of these towns were the most progressive, favoring acculturation, formal education, and modern methods of farming.

Facing removal, the Lower Cherokee were the first to move west. Remaining Lower Town leaders, such as Young Dragging Canoe and [[Sequoyah]], were strong advocates of voluntary relocation.

===Removal era===
In 1815, the US government established a Cherokee Reservation in Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Charles Russell. [http://www.arkansaspreservation.org/pdf/publications/Cherokee_Removal.pdf "The Promised Land: The Cherokees, Arkansas, and Removal, 1794–1839."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020141831/http://www.arkansaspreservation.org/pdf/publications/Cherokee_Removal.pdf |date=2007-10-20 }} ''Arkansas Historic Preservation Program.'' 1997 (retrieved 21 Sept 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The reservation boundaries extended from north of the [[Arkansas River]] to the southern bank of the White River. [[The Bowl (Cherokee chief)|The Bowl]], Sequoyah, Spring Frog and Tatsi (Dutch) and their bands settled there. These Cherokees became known as "Old Settlers."

[[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] became the Principal Chief of the tribe in 1828 and remained the chief until his death in 1866.

====Treaty party====
Among the Cherokee, John Ross led the battle to halt their removal. Ross' supporters, commonly referred to as the "National Party," were opposed by a group known as the "Ridge Party" or the "Treaty Party". The Treaty Party signed the [[Treaty of New Echota]], stipulating terms and conditions for the removal of the Cherokee Nation from the lands in the East for lands in [[Indian Territory]].

====Trail of Tears====
{{Main|Trail of Tears}}
[[File:Chief John Ross.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], ca. 1840]]
Cherokees were displaced from their ancestral lands in northern Georgia and the Carolinas in a period of rapidly expanding white population. Some of the rapid expansion was due to a [[gold rush]] around [[Dahlonega, Georgia]] in the 1830s.  President [[Andrew Jackson]] said removal policy was an effort to prevent the Cherokee from facing the fate of "the [[Mohegan]], the [[Narragansett tribe|Narragansett]], and the [[Delaware tribe|Delaware]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wishart, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is ample evidence that the Cherokee were adapting modern farming techniques, and a modern analysis shows that the area was in general in a state of economic surplus.&lt;ref&gt;Wishart 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1830, a delegation of Cherokees led by Chief Ross brought their grievances about tribal sovereignty over state government to the US Supreme Court in the ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'' case. In the case ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that Cherokee Native Americans were entitled to federal protection from the actions of state governments. ''Worcester v. Georgia'' is considered one of the most important decisions in law dealing with Native Americans.

Despite the ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'' ruling in their favor, the majority of Cherokees were forcibly relocated westward to [[Indian Territory]] in 1838–1839, a migration known as the [[Trail of Tears]] or in Cherokee ᏅᎾ ᏓᎤᎳ ᏨᏱ or ''Nvna Daula Tsvyi'' (Cherokee: The Trail Where They Cried). This took place during the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830. The harsh treatment the Cherokee received at the hands of white settlers caused some to enroll to emigrate west.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue (2000), p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; As some Cherokees were slaveholders, they took enslaved African-Americans with them west of the Mississippi. Intermarried European-Americans and missionaries also walked the Trail of Tears.

On June 22, 1839, Major Ridge, John Ridge and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]] were assassinated by a party of twenty-five extremist Ross supporters that included Daniel Colston, John Vann, Archibald Spear, James Spear, Joseph Spear, Hunter, and others.  [[Stand Watie]] fought off the attempt on his life that day and escaped to [[Arkansas]].

====Eastern Band====
[[File:Cól-lee, a Band Chief.jpg|thumb|[[Cól-lee]], a Band Chief, painted by [[George Catlin]], 1834.]]

Some Cherokees were able to evade removal, and they became the East Band of Cherokee Indians. [[William Holland Thomas]], a white storeowner and state legislator from [[Jackson County, North Carolina]], helped over 600 Cherokee from [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Qualla Town]] obtain North Carolina citizenship, which exempted them from forced removal. Over 400 other Cherokee either hid from Federal troops in the remote Snowbird Mountains, under the leadership of [[Tsali]] (ᏣᎵ),&lt;ref name=Tsali&gt;[http://www.cherokee-nc.com/history.php?Name=Tsali "Tsali."] ''History and culture of the Cherokee (North Carolina Indians).'' (2007-03-10)&lt;/ref&gt; or belonged to in the former Valley Towns area around the [[Cheoah River]] who negotiated to stay in North Carolina with the state government. An additional 400 Cherokee stayed on reserves in Southeast Tennessee, North Georgia, and Northeast Alabama, as citizens of their respective states, mostly mixed-bloods and Cherokee women married to white men. Together, these groups were the basis for what is now known as the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]].

===Civil War===
{{Further|Cherokee in the American Civil War|Native Americans in the Civil War}}
The [[American Civil War]] was devastating for both East and Western Cherokees. Those Cherokees aided by William Thomas became the Thomas Legion of Cherokee Indians and Highlanders, fighting for the Confederacy in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Will_Thomas&gt;[http://www.cherokee-nc.com/history.php?Name=Will%20Thomas "Will Thomas."] ''History and culture of the Cherokee (North Carolina Indians).'' (2007-03-10)&lt;/ref&gt; Cherokees in Indian Territory split into Confederate and Union factions.

===Reconstruction and late 19th century===
[[File:Group of Cherokee, Yankton, and Sisseton 1909.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Group of Cherokee, [[Yankton Dakota|Yankton]], and [[Sisseton]] 1909.]]

As in southern states, the end of the Civil War brought freedom to enslaved African Americans held by Cherokee. By an 1866 treaty with the US government, the Cherokee agreed to grant tribal citizenship to [[freedmen]] who had been held by them as slaves. Both before and after the Civil War, some Cherokee intermarried or had relationships with African Americans, just as they had with whites. Many Cherokee Freedmen were active politically within the tribe.

The US government also acquired easement rights to the western part of the territory, which became the Oklahoma Territory, for the construction of railroads. Development and settlers followed the railroads. By the late 19th century, the government believed that Native Americans would be better off if each family owned its own land. The [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 provided for the breakup of commonly held tribal land. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve. This also opened up later sales of land by individuals to people outside the tribe.  
[[File:CherokeeOTSA.PNG|thumb|Map of the present-day Cherokee Nation Tribal Jurisdiction Area (dark blue)]]

The [[Curtis Act of 1898]] advanced the break-up of Native American government. For the Oklahoma Territory, this meant abolition of the Cherokee courts and governmental systems by the U.S. Federal Government. This was seen as necessary before the Oklahoma and Indian territories could be admitted as states.

By the late 19th century, the Eastern Band of Cherokees were laboring under the constraints of a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] society. In the aftermath of Reconstruction, conservative white Democrats regained power in North Carolina and other southern states. They proceeded to effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchise]] all blacks and many poor whites by new constitutions and laws related to voter registration and elections. They passed [[Jim Crow laws]] that divided society into "white" and "colored", mostly to control freedmen, but the Native Americans were included on the colored side and suffered the same racial segregation and disfranchisement as former slaves. Blacks and Native Americans would not regain their rights as US citizens until the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.

Deliberate destruction and theft of cultural heritage has been conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] since 2014 in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and to a lesser extent in [[Libya]]. The destruction targets various places of worship under ISIL control and ancient historical artifacts. In Iraq, between the [[fall of Mosul]] in June 2014 and February 2015, ISIL had plundered and destroyed at least 28 historical religious buildings.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01 |title=Iraq churches, mosques under ISIS attack |author=Khalid al-Taie |publisher=mawtani.al-shorfa.com |date=13 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219092526/http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01 |archivedate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valuable items from some buildings were looted in order to smuggle and sell them to finance ISIS activities.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt;

ISIL uses a unit called the ''Kata'ib Taswiyya'' (settlement battalions) to select targets for demolition.&lt;ref name="gi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4973/destruction-middle-east-antiquities |title=The Destruction of the Middle East |author=Denis MacEoin |publisher=[[Gatestone Institute]] |date=27 December 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] Director-General [[Irina Bokova]] branded the ISIS activities in this respect as "a form of [[cultural cleansing]]"&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt; and launched the [[Unite4Heritage]] campaign to protect heritage sites threatened by extremists.

==Motivation==

ISIL justifies the destruction of cultural heritage sites with its extreme following of [[Salafism]] which, according to its followers, places "great importance on establishing [[tawhid]] (monotheism)", and "eliminating [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] (polytheism)." While it is often assumed that the group's actions are mindless acts of vandalism, there is an ideological underpinning to the destruction. ISIL views its actions in sites like Palmyra and Nimrud as being in accordance with Sunni [[Islam]]ic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/religion-geopolitics/commentaries/glance/dont-be-surprised-isis-destroying-history |title=Don't Be Surprised by ISIS Destroying History |publisher=Tony Blair Faith Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the ideological aspects of the destruction, there are other, more practical, reasons behind ISIL's destruction of historic sites. Grabbing the world's attention is easily done through the destruction of such sites, given the extensive media coverage and international condemnation that comes afterwards. Destroying historic ruins also allows ISIL to wipe the slate clean and to start afresh, leaving no traces of any previous culture or civilization, while also providing an ideal platform for the group to establish its own identity and leave its mark on history. Despite the images showing extreme destruction, ISIL has also been making use of the looted antiquities to finance their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/15/iraq-isis-arrest-jihadists-wealth-power |title=How an arrest in Iraq revealed Isis's $2bn jihadist network |author=Martin Chulov |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the UN's ban on the trade of artifacts looted from Syria since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/12/us-mideast-crisis-un-idUSKBN0LG1YN20150212 |title=U.N.

The statue remained buried until 1941 when heavy rains eroded the soil around the gate and exposed two statues on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsmax.com/US/ISIS-radical-islam-Mosul/2015/03/02/id/627831 |title=What's Been Lost to Radical Islamists' Sledgehammers |publisher=[[Newsmax Media]] |author=John Burger |date=2 March 2015 |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other defaced items in the museum were claimed to be copies,&lt;ref name="news"/&gt; but this was later rebutted by Iraq's Minister of Culture, Adel Sharshab who said: "Mosul Museum had many ancient artifacts, big and small.

====Palmyra====
[[File:Temple of Bel, Palmyra 02.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of Bel]] in [[Palmyra]], which was blown up by ISIL in August 2015]]
Following the [[Tadmur offensive (2015)|capture of Palmyra]] in Syria, ISIL was reported as not intending to demolish the city's World Heritage Site (while still intending to destroy any statues deemed '[[Polytheism|polytheistic]]').&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/27/isis-releases-footage-of-palmyra-ruins-intact |title=Syria: Isis releases footage of Palmyra ruins intact and 'will not destroy them' |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2015, ISIL released a 87-second video showing parts of the apparently undamaged ancient [[colonnade]]s, the [[Temple of Bel]] and the [[Roman Theatre at Palmyra|Roman theatre]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"/&gt; On 27 June 2015, however, ISIL demolished the ancient [[Lion of Al-lāt]] statue in Palmyra. Several other statues from Palmyra reportedly confiscated from a smuggler were also destroyed by ISIL.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; On 23 August 2015, it was reported that ISIL had blown up the 1st-century [[Temple of Baalshamin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34036644 Palmyra's Baalshamin temple 'blown up by IS'], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/isis-blows-up-temple-dating-back-to-17ad-in-unesco-listed-syrian-city Isis 'blows up temple dating back to 17AD' in Syrian city of Palmyra], TheGuardian.com; accessed 25 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August 2015, ISIL demolished the [[Temple of Bel]] with explosives.

According to the report issued on September 3, 2015 by ASOR Syrian Heritage initiative, ISIL also destroyed seven ancient tower tombs in Palmyra since the end of June over two phases.&lt;ref name="natpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/intolerable-crime-against-civilization-isil-destroys-three-ancient-tower-tombs-in-palmyra |title=In latest round of destruction, ISIL reduces three ancient tower tombs in Palmyra to rubble |work=[[National Post]] |date=September 4, 2015 |accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last phase of destruction occurred between August 27 and September 2, 2015, including the destruction of the 2nd-century AD [[Tower of Elahbel]], called "the most prominent example of Palmyra's distinct funerary monuments".&lt;ref name="natpost"/&gt; Earlier, the ancient tombs of Iamliku and Atenaten were also destroyed.&lt;ref name="natpost"/&gt; The [[Monumental Arch of Palmyra|Monumental Arch]] was also blown up in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shaheen |first1=Kareem |title=Isis blows up Arch of Triumph in 2,000-year-old city of Palmyra |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/05/isis-blows-up-another-monument-in-2000-year-old-city-of-palmyra |accessdate=5 October 2015 |work=The Guardian |date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL has also looted and demolished the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]/[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of [[Dura-Europos]] in east of Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/09/232028.htm |title=We're sorry, that page can't be found. |website=www.state.gov |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknamed "the [[Pompeii]] of the desert", the city was of particular archaeological significance.

====Hatra====
[[Hatra]] (Arabic: الحضر al-Ḥaḍr) was an ancient city in the Ninawa Governorate and al-Jazira region of Iraq. A large fortified city and capital of the first Arab Kingdom, Hatra withstood invasions by the Romans in A.D. 116 and 198 thanks to its high, thick walls reinforced by towers.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/277&lt;/ref&gt; However about 240 ce,  the city fell to Shāpūr I (reigned c. 240–272), the ruler of the Persian Sāsānian dynasty, and was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Hatra&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the city, especially the temples where Hellenistic and Roman architecture blend with Eastern decorative features, attest to the greatness of its civilization.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"/&gt; The city lies 290&amp;nbsp;km (180&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of Baghdad and 110&amp;nbsp;km (68&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of Mosul.
On 7 March 2015, various sources including Iraqi officials reported that the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) had begun demolishing the ruins of Hatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-08/islamic-state-militants-raze-iraq-ancient-hatra-city/6288618 |title=IS continues cultural cleansing of Iraq with Hatra's destruction: UNESCO |date=8 March 2015 |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video released by ISIL the next month showed destruction of the monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bcdd18ddfe5143f08e5e2335e19e5af9/video-islamic-state-group-shot-hammered-away-iraqs-hatra |title=Video: Islamic State group shot, hammered away Iraq's Hatra |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient city was recaptured by the [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] on 26 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-39726244 |title=IS conflict: Iraqi force 'retakes ancient city of Hatra' |date=26 April 2017 |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017 |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libraries===

ISIL has burned or stolen collections of books and papers from various locations, including the [[Central Library of Mosul]] (which they rigged with explosives and burned down),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-burns-down-mosul-library-destroys-8000-rare-books-manuscripts-624375 |title=Isis Burns Down Mosul Library, Destroys 8,000 Rare Books and Manuscripts |first=Johnlee |last=Varghese |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the library at the [[University of Mosul]], a Sunni Muslim library, a 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers, and the Mosul Museum Library. Some destroyed or stolen works date back to 5000 BC and include "Iraq newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire, and book collections contributed by about 100 of Mosul’s establishment families." The stated goal is to destroy all non-Islamic books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-hijacks-mosul-university-chemistry-lab-for-making-bombs-1459503003 |title=Islamic State Hijacks Mosul University Chemistry Lab for Making Bombs |last=London |first=Margaret Coker in |date=2016-04-01 |last2=Baghdad |first2=Ben Kesling in |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |issn=0099-9660|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 2014, the United States Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] announced that the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] had partnered with the American Schools of Orient Research Cultural Heritage Initiatives to "comprehensively document the condition of, and threats to, cultural heritage sites in Iraq and Syria to assess their future restoration, preservation, and protection needs".&lt;ref name="usdep"/&gt; In 2014, the [[UNESCO]]'s Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict condemned at the Ninth Meeting "repeated and deliberate attacks against cultural property... in particular in the Syrian Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/syria-crisis-response/regional-response/single-view/news/reinforce_the_immunity_of_our_common_heritage_under_threat/#.VPDhTY6rEYJ |title=Reinforce the immunity of our common heritage under threat |publisher=UNESCO |date=21 December 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO Director-General [[Irina Bokova]] called the destructions in Mosul a violation of the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2199]],&lt;ref name="news"/&gt; and the destruction of Nimrud a [[war crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nimrud: Outcry as IS bulldozers attack ancient Iraq site |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-31760656 |accessdate=6 March 2015 |work=BBC News |date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Prime Minister of Iraq [[Nouri al-Maliki]] reported that the local parliamentary tourism and antiquities committee had "filed complaints with the UN to condemn all ISIL crimes and abuses, including those that affect ancient places of worship".&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt; On 28 May 2015, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] unanimously passed a resolution, initiated by Germany and Iraq and sponsored by 91 UN member states, stating that ISIL's destruction of cultural heritage may amount to a war crime and urging international measures to halt such acts, which it described as a "tactic of war".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/69/281|UNGA Resolution 69/281], un.org; accessed 15 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general director of the [[National Museum (Prague)|Czech National Museum]], Michal Lukeš, signed an agreement in June 2017 committing the institution to help Syria save, preserve and conserve much of its cultural and historical heritage damaged by war, including the ancient site of Palmyra; he met with Maamoun Abdulkarim and discussed plans for the works that are said to last until 2019.&lt;ref name=czradio&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnstone |first1=Chris |title=Czechs sign up to help save Syrian cultural heritage |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/czechs-sign-up-to-help-save-syrian-cultural-heritage |accessdate=24 June 2017 |work=Radio Praha |date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, The World Monuments Fund (WMF) announced launching a £500,000 scheme to train Syrian refugees near the Syrian-Jordanian border in traditional stone masonry.

In response, Minamoto no Yoriyoshi is appointed governor of Mutsu and he is named ''chinjufu shōgun.''  He is given these titles and powers so that he will be able to restore peace in the north. Yoriyoshi would have been the first to receive this specific shogunal title, although his grandfather ([[Minamoto no Tsunemoto]]) had been ''seitō fuku-shōgun'' (assistant commander for pacification of the east).&lt;ref&gt;Varley, pp. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ekaterina Shchepkina''' (1854 – 1938) was a Russian [[feminist]], [[historian]] and [[journalist]].

==Life==
Ekaterina Nikolaevna Shchepkina was born in 1854 and attended the [[Courses Guerrier]] in [[Moscow]] and the [[Bestuzhev Courses]] in [[St Petersburg]] as a protégé of the director, the historian [[Konstantin Bestuzhev-Ryumin]]. She taught history classes for workers at the Imperial Technical Society (''Imperatorskoe Technicheskoe Obshchestvo'') from 1890 and later taught history at the Bestuzhev Courses in the latter half of the 1890s. She also wrote a history of Russia, two historical monographs and articles on women's history and issues. Shchepkina was one of the founders of the All-Russian [[Union for Women's Equality]] in February 1905 and joined the All-Russian [[League for Women's Equality]] after the Union dissolved at the end of the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution]] in 1906. Shchepkina gave a talk at the 1908 All-Russian Women's Congress (''Pervyi Vserossiisskii Zhenskii S’ezd'') and was one of the League's ten candidates for the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]] after the [[February Revolution]] of 1917. She published a history of the women's movement during the [[French Revolution]] in 1921 with an introduction by [[Alexandra Kollontai]]. Little is known about Shchepkina's activities after 1926. She died in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthchild, pp. 507–08&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astronomy]] and [[celestial navigation]], an '''ephemeris''' (plural: '''ephemerides'''; {{ety|la|ephemeris|diary}}, {{ety|gre|''εφημερίς'' (ephemeris)|diary, journal}}{{sfn|ephemeris|1992}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.27:9:113.LSJ|title=Liddell &amp; Scott Dictionary on Perseus at University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ephemeris|title=Dictionary − ephemeris|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ephemeris|url=http://www.lexilogos.com/latin/gaffiot.php?q=ephemeris|work=Dictionnaire Gaffiot latin-français}}&lt;/ref&gt;) gives the positions of naturally occurring [[astronomical objects]] as well as [[artificial satellites]] in the [[sky]] at a given [[time]] or times. Historically, positions were given as printed [[table (information)|table]]s of [[quantity|values]], given at regular intervals of date and time. Modern ephemerides are often computed electronically from mathematical models of the motion of astronomical objects and the Earth. Even though the calculation of these tables was one of the [[history of computing|first applications of mechanical computers]], printed ephemerides are still produced, as they are useful when computational devices are not available.

The astronomical position calculated from an ephemeris is given in the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical polar coordinate system]] of [[right ascension]] and [[declination]]. Some of the astronomical phenomena of interest to astronomers are [[eclipse]]s, [[apparent retrograde motion]]/planetary stations, planetary {{linktext|ingress}}es, [[sidereal time]], positions for the mean and true [[Lunar node|nodes of the moon]], the [[phases of the Moon]], and the positions of minor [[celestial bodies]] such as [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]].

Ephemerides are used in celestial navigation and astronomy. They are also used by some [[astrologers]].

*1st millennium BC – Ephemerides in [[Babylonian astronomy]].
*2nd century AD – the ''Almagest'' and the ''Handy Tables'' of [[Ptolemy]]
*8th century AD – the ''{{transl|ar|[[zīj]]}}'' of [[Ibrāhīm al-Fazārī]]
*9th century AD – the ''{{transl|ar|zīj}}'' of [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]]
*12th century AD – the ''[[Tables of Toledo]]'' – based largely on Arabic ''{{transl|ar|zīj}}'' sources of [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Islamic astronomy]] – were edited by [[Gerard of Cremona]] to form the standard European ephemeris until the ''[[Alfonsine Tables]]''.
*13th century – the ''[[Zīj-i Īlkhānī]]'' (''Ilkhanic Tables'') were compiled at the [[Maragheh observatory]] in Persia.
*13th century – the ''[[Alfonsine Tables]]'' were compiled in Spain to correct anomalies in the ''Tables of Toledo'', remaining the standard European ephemeris until the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'' almost 300 years later.
*13th century AD - the ''[[Dresden Codex]]'', an extant Mayan ephemeris
*1408 – [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]] ephemeris table (copy in [[Pepysian Library]], Cambridge, UK (refer book '1434'); Chinese tables believed known to [[Regiomontanus]]).
*1496 – the ''Almanach Perpetuum'' of [[Abraham Zacuto|Abraão ben Samuel Zacuto]] (one of the first books published  with a [[movable type]] and [[printing press]] in [[Portugal]])
*1504 – While shipwrecked on the island of Jamaica, [[Christopher Columbus]] successfully predicted a lunar eclipse for the natives, using the ephemeris of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]].
*1531 – Work of [[Johannes Stöffler]] is published posthumously at Tübingen, extending the ephemeris of Regiomontanus through 1551.
*1551 – the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'' of [[Erasmus Reinhold]] were published, based on [[Copernicus]]'s theories.
*1554 – [[Johannes Stadius]] published ''Ephemerides novae et auctae'', the first major ephemeris computed according to Copernicus' [[heliocentric model]], using parameters derived from the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]''.  Although the Copernican model provided an elegant solution to the problem of computing apparent planetary positions (it avoided the need for the [[equant]] and better explained the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of planets), it still relied on the use of [[epicycles]], leading to some inaccuracies – for example, periodic errors in the position of Mercury of up to ten degrees.  One of the users of Stadius's tables is [[Tycho Brahe]].
*1627 – the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' of [[Johannes Kepler]] based on elliptical planetary motion became the new standard.
*1679 – ''La [[Connaissance des Temps]] ou calendrier et éphémérides du lever &amp; coucher du Soleil, de la Lune &amp; des autres planètes'', first published yearly by [[Jean Picard]] and still extant.
*1975 – [[Owen Gingerich]], using modern planetary theory and digital computers, calculates the actual positions of the planets in the 16th Century and graphs the errors in the planetary positions predicted by the ephemerides of Stöffler, Stadius and others. According to Gingerich, the error patterns "are as distinctive as fingerprints and reflect the characteristics of the underlying tables.  That is, the error patterns for Stöffler are different from those of Stadius, but the error patterns of Stadius closely resemble those of [[Maestlin]], [[Giovanni Antonio Magini|Magini]], [[David Origanus|Origanus]], and others who followed the Copernican parameters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gingerich |first=Owen |date=1975 |title="Crisis" versus Aesthetic in the Copernican Revolution |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4258973/Crisis%20vs%20Aesthetic%20OGingrich.pdf |journal=Vistas in Astronomy |publisher=[[Elsevier BV]] |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=85–95 |access-date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern ephemeris ==
For scientific uses, a modern planetary ephemeris comprises software that generates positions of planets and often of their satellites, [[asteroid]]s, or [[comet]]s, at virtually any time desired by the user.

Typically, such ephemerides cover several centuries, past and future; the future ones can be covered because the field of [[celestial mechanics]] has developed several accurate theories. Nevertheless, there are [[Secular variation|secular phenomena]] which cannot adequately be considered by ephemerides. The greatest uncertainties in the positions of planets are caused by the perturbations of numerous [[asteroid]]s, most of whose masses and orbits are poorly known, rendering their effect uncertain. Reflecting the continuing influx of new data and observations, [[NASA]]'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([[JPL]]) has revised its [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|published ephemerides]] nearly every year for the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgij A. Krasinsky]] and [[Victor A. Brumberg]], ''Secular Increase of Astronomical Unit from Analysis of the Major Planet Motions, and its Interpretation'' [http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/GAKVAB.pdf Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy 90: 267–288, (2004)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar system]] ephemerides are essential for the navigation of [[spacecraft]] and for all kinds of space observations of the [[planet]]s, their [[natural satellite]]s, [[star]]s, and [[Galaxy|galaxies]].

Scientific ephemerides for sky observers mostly contain the positions of celestial bodies in [[right ascension]] and [[declination]], because these coordinates are the most frequently used on star maps and telescopes. The [[Equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]] of the coordinate system must be given. It is, in nearly all cases, either the actual equinox (the equinox valid for that moment, often referred to as "of date" or "current"), or that of one of the "standard" equinoxes, typically [[J2000.0]], [[B1950.0]], or J1900. Star maps almost always use one of the standard equinoxes.

Scientific ephemerides often contain further useful data about the moon, planet, asteroid, or comet beyond the pure coordinates in the sky, such as elongation to the sun, brightness, distance, velocity, apparent diameter in the sky, phase angle, times of rise, transit, and set, etc.
Ephemerides of the planet [[Saturn]] also sometimes contain the apparent inclination of its ring.

[[Celestial navigation]] serves as a backup to the [[Global Positioning System]]. Software is widely available to assist with this form of navigation; some of this software has a self-contained ephemeris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = American Practical Navigator: An Epitiome of Navigation | date = 2002 | page = 270 | publisher = National Imagery and Mapping Agency | location = Bethesda, MD | url = http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_62&amp;pubCode=0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; When software is used that does not contain an ephemeris, or if no software is used, position data for celestial objects may be obtained from the modern ''[[Nautical Almanac]]'' or ''Air Almanac''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Almanacs and Other Publications — Naval Oceanography Portal| accessdate = 11 November 2016| url = http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/publications | publisher = [[United States Naval Observatory]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ephemeris is usually only correct for a particular location on the Earth. In many cases, the differences are too small to matter. However, for nearby [[asteroid]]s or the [[Moon]], they can be quite important.

[[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) navigation satellites transmit electronic ephemeris data consisting of health and exact location data. A GPS receiver can use the transmissions from multiple such satellites to calculate its own location using [[trilateration]].

Other modern ephemerides recently created are the EPM (Ephemerides of Planets and the Moon), from the Russian Institute for Applied Astronomy of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pitjeva|first=Elena V.|title=The dynamical model of the planet motions and EPM ephemerides|journal=Highlights of Astronomy|date=August 2006|volume=14|pages=470|doi=10.1017/S1743921307011453|bibcode=2007HiA....14..470P}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the INPOP (''{{lang|fr|Intégrateur numérique planétaire de l'[[Observatoire de Paris]]}}'') by the French [[IMCCE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INPOP10e, a 4-D planetary ephemeris|url=http://www.imcce.fr/inpop/|publisher=IMCCE|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erich Anton Paul von Däniken''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛr|ᵻ|k|_|f|ɒ|n|_|ˈ|d|ɛ|n|ᵻ|k|ᵻ|n}}; {{IPA-de|ˈeːrɪç fɔn ˈdɛːnɪkən|lang}}; born 14 April 1935) is a Swiss author of several books which make claims about [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] influences on early human culture, including the best-selling ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', published in 1968. Von Däniken is one of the main figures responsible for popularizing the "paleo-contact" and [[ancient astronauts]] hypotheses. The ideas put forth in his books are rejected by a majority of scientists and academics, who categorize his work as [[pseudohistory]], [[pseudoarchaeology]], and [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fagan|first=Brian M.|title=In the beginning: an introduction to archaeology|year=2000|edition=10th|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-030731-6|pages=17–18|quote= … Flamboyant pseudoarchaeology of the type espoused by von Däniken and Hancock will always appeal to people who are impatient …}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orser|first=Charles E.|title=Race and practice in archaeological interpretation|year=2003|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-3750-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EU7Z_jCXh5kC&amp;pg=PA73|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fritze|first=Ronald H.|title=Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-religions|year=2009|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-430-4|pages=13, 200, 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career, he was convicted and served time for several counts of [[fraud]] or [[embezzlement]], and even wrote one of his books in prison.

Von Däniken later became a co-founder of the Archaeology, Astronautics and SETI Research Association (AAS RA). He designed Mystery Park (now known as [[Jungfrau Park]]), a [[amusement park|theme park]] located in [[Interlaken]], Switzerland, that opened in May 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mystery Park, Interlaken |url=http://www.switzerlandflexitours.com/switzerland-attractions/mystery-park-interlaken.html |publisher=Switzerland Flexitours |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Von Däniken was born in [[Zofingen]], [[Aargau]]. Brought up as a Roman Catholic, he attended the Saint-Michel International Catholic School in [[Fribourg]], Switzerland. During his time at the school he rejected the church's interpretations of the Bible and developed an interest in astronomy and the phenomenon of [[flying saucer]]s.&lt;ref name=playboy&gt;Playboy, August 1974 (volume 21, number 8)&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 19, he was given a four-month suspended sentence for theft.&lt;ref name=playboy/&gt; He left the school and was apprenticed to a Swiss hotelier for a time,&lt;ref&gt;Story(1976), p1&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to Egypt. In December 1964, von Däniken wrote ''Hatten unsere Vorfahren Besuch aus dem Weltraum?'' ("Did our Ancestors have a Visit from Space?") for the German-Canadian periodical ''Der Nordwesten''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Krassa, ''Disciple of the Gods: A Biography of Erich von Däniken'' (W.H. Allen &amp; Co., Ltd, 1976, {{ISBN|0-352-30262-3}}), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; While in Egypt, he was involved in a jewelry deal which resulted in a nine-month conviction for fraud and embezzlement upon his return to Switzerland.&lt;ref name=playboy/&gt;

Following his release, von Däniken became a [[Hotel manager|manager]] of the Hotel Rosenhügel in [[Davos]], Switzerland, during which time he wrote ''Chariots of the Gods?'' (German ''Erinnerungen an die Zukunft'', which literally translated is "Memories of the Future"), working on the manuscript late at night after the hotel's guests had retired.&lt;ref name=revealed/&gt; The draft of the book was turned down by several publishers. [[Econ Verlag]] (now part of [[Ullstein Verlag]]) was willing to publish the book after a complete reworking by a professional author, [[:de:Utz Utermann|Utz Utermann]], who used the pseudonym of Wilhelm Roggersdorf. Utermann was a former ''Schriftleiter'' of ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' and had been a Nazi bestselling author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lwl.org/literaturkommission/alex/index.php?id=00000003&amp;letter=U&amp;layout=2&amp;author_id=00001703 "Wilhelm Utermann" (in German)], Eintrag im ''Lexikon westfälischer Autorinnen und Autoren''.&lt;/ref&gt; The re-write of ''Chariots of the Gods?'' was accepted for publication early in 1967, but not printed until March 1968.&lt;ref name=revealed/&gt; Against all expectations, the book gained widespread interest and became a bestseller. Von Däniken was paid 7 percent of the book's turnover, while 3 percent went to Utermann.&lt;ref&gt;Der Spiegel, 5202660, Wie es unser Explorand sehr schön zeigt, by [[Gerhard Mauz]], 1970, Nr.7, 1970-02-09, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, ''Der Spiegel'' referred to the hype over Däniken as ''Dänikitis''.&lt;ref name="Spiegel 40/70"&gt;Der Spiegel 44418148 Gläubige Gemeinde, 1970, Nr. 40, 1970-09-28, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1968 von Däniken was arrested for fraud, after falsifying hotel records and credit references in order to take out loans&lt;ref name=revealed&gt;{{cite book |last= Story |first= Ronald |title= The space-gods revealed: a close look at the theories of Erich von Däniken |publisher= Harper &amp; Row |location= New York |year= 1976 |isbn= 0-06-014141-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $130,000 over a period of twelve years. He used the money for foreign travel to research his book.&lt;ref name=playboy/&gt; Two years later,&lt;ref name=revealed/&gt; von Däniken was convicted for "repeated and sustained" embezzlement, fraud, and forgery, with the court ruling that the writer had been living a "[[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]]" lifestyle.&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite news |first= Richard R. |last= Lingeman |title= Erich von Daniken's Genesis |date= 31 March 1974 |work=The New York Times |page= 6 |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20710FF3B5F107A93C3AA1788D85F408785F9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He unsuccessfully entered a plea of [[void (law)|nullity]], on the grounds that his intentions were not malicious and that the credit institutions were at fault for failing adequately to research his references,&lt;ref name=playboy/&gt;&lt;ref name=revealed/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt; and on 13 February 1970 he was sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment and was also fined 3,000 francs.&lt;ref name=revealed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Däniken's side of the story is given in Krassa, pp. 96–107.&lt;/ref&gt; He served one year of this sentence before being released.&lt;ref name=playboy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transcripts of Däniken's letters to his wife Elizabeth (whom he married in 1959), during this period are provided in Krassa, pp. 130–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

His first book, ''Chariots of the Gods?'', had been published by the time of his trial, and its sales allowed him to repay his debts and leave the hotel business. Von Däniken wrote his second book, ''Gods from Outer Space'', while in prison.&lt;ref name=playboy/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;

==Claims of alien influence on Earth==
The general claim of von Däniken over several published books, starting with ''Chariots of the Gods?'' in 1968, is that extraterrestrials or "ancient astronauts" visited Earth and influenced early human culture. Von Däniken writes about his belief that structures such as the [[Egyptian pyramids]], [[Stonehenge]], and the [[Moai]] of [[Easter Island]] and [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s from that period [[out-of-place artifact|represent higher technological knowledge]] than is presumed to have existed at the times they were manufactured. He also describes ancient artwork throughout the world as containing depictions of astronauts, air and space vehicles, extraterrestrials, and complex technology. Von Däniken explains the origins of religions as reactions to contact with an alien race, and offers interpretations of sections of the Old Testament of the [[Bible]].

===Criticism===
In 1966, when von Däniken was writing his first book, scientists [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Iosif Samuilovich Shklovskii|I.&amp;nbsp;S. Shklovskii]] wrote about the possibility of paleocontact and extraterrestrial visitation claims in one chapter of their book ''Intelligent Life in the Universe'', leading author Ronald Story to speculate in his book ''The Space-gods Revealed'' that this may have been the genesis of von Däniken's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Story|1980|pp=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ideas from this book appeared in different form in Däniken's books.

Prior to von Däniken's work, other authors had presented ideas of extraterrestrial contacts. He has failed to credit these authors properly or at all, even when making the same claims using similar or identical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Story|1980|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of von Däniken's ''Erinnerungen an die Zukunft'' failed to cite [[Robert Charroux]]'s ''One Hundred Thousand Years of Man's Unknown History'' despite making very similar claims, and publisher Econ-Verlag were forced to add Charroux in the bibliography in later editions, to avoid a possible lawsuit for [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Story|1980|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Logical and factual errors====
{{quote|1=That writing as careless as von Däniken's, whose principal thesis is that our ancestors were dummies, should be so popular is a sober commentary on the credulousness and despair of our times. I also hope for the continuing popularity of books like ''Chariots of the Gods?'' in high school and college logic courses, as object lessons in sloppy thinking. I know of no recent books so riddled with logical and factual errors as the works of von Däniken.&lt;ref name="Story 1980 xi-xiii"&gt;{{harvnb|Story|1980|pp=xi–xiii}} foreword written by Carl Sagan&lt;/ref&gt;|2=Carl Sagan|3=Foreword to ''The Space Gods Revealed''}}

[[File:QtubIronPillar.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[iron pillar of Delhi]], erected by [[Chandragupta&amp;nbsp;II]] the Great]]

=====Iron pillar of Delhi=====
In ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', von Däniken cited the [[Iron pillar of Delhi]], in India, as a prime example of extraterrestrial influence due to its "unknown origins" and a complete absence of rust despite its estimated 1500 years of continuous exposure to the elements.&lt;ref&gt;Däniken, Erich von: ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; When informed by an interviewer, in 1974, that the pillar was not in fact rust-free, and that its origin, method of construction, and relative resistance to corrosion were all well understood, von Däniken responded that he no longer believed extraterrestrials had been involved in its creation.&lt;ref name=play64&gt;''[[Playboy magazine]]'', p. 64, Volume 21 Number 8, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Story|1980|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cueva de los Tayos=====
In ''The Gold of the Gods'', von Däniken describes an expedition that he undertook through man-made tunnels within [[Cueva de los Tayos]], a natural cave system in [[Ecuador]], guided by a local man named Juan Moricz. He reported seeing mounds of gold, strange statues, and a library containing metal tablets, all of which he considered to be evidence of ancient extraterrestrial visitation. A local priest, Father Crespi, stewarded a collection of the gold extraterrestrial relics, he said, with special permission from the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Moricz told ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' that there had been no expedition; von Däniken's descriptions came from "a long conversation", and the photos in the book had been "fiddled".&lt;ref name="story moricz"&gt;{{harvnb|Story|1980|pp=78–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1974 interview, von Däniken asserted that he had indeed seen the library and the artifacts in the tunnels, but he had embellished some aspects of the story to make it more interesting. "In German we say a writer, if he is not writing pure science, is allowed to use some ''dramaturgische Effekte'' – some theatrical effects," he said. "And that's what I have done."&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Däniken continued to maintain that he had been inside the caves, " ... but not at the place where the photographs in the book were taken, not at the main entrance. I was at a side entrance." He said Moricz's expedition crew had been forced by some unknown entity to sign a "pledge of silence", which explained Moricz's refusal to corroborate his account. Later, he said, a "leading German archaeologist", dispatched to Ecuador to verify his claims, could not locate Moricz. (''Playboy'', p. 58)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="horizon moricz"&gt;{{cite episode |title= The Case of the Ancient Astronauts |series= Horizon |serieslink= Horizon (BBC TV series) |network= [[BBC]] |airdate= 3 August 1978 |time= 41:15–42:20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, he admitted that he had never been inside Cueva de los Tayos, and had fabricated the entire cave adventure.&lt;ref name="horizon moricz"/&gt; A geologist found no evidence of artificial tunnels in the area.&lt;ref name="story moricz"/&gt; Father Crespi's gold artifacts, according to an archeologist consulted by ''Der Spiegel'', were mostly brass imitations sold locally as tourist souvenirs.&lt;ref name="story moricz"/&gt;

====="Book of Dzyan" and "Tulli Papyrus"=====
[[Samuel Rosenberg (writer)|Samuel Rosenberg]] said that the [[Book of Dzyan]], referred to by von Däniken,&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt; was "a fabrication superimposed on a gigantic hoax concocted by [[Helena Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky]]." He also says that the "[[Tulli Papyrus]]", cited by von Däniken in one of his books,&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt; is probably cribbed from the [[Book of Ezekiel]], and quoted Nolli (through Walter Ramberg, Scientific Attache at the U.S. embassy in Rome), then current Director of the Egyptian Section of the Vatican Museum, as "suspect[ing] that Tulli was taken in and that the papyrus is a fake."&lt;ref name="condon "&gt;Edward Uhler Condon, "[http://files.ncas.org/condon/ Scientific Study of Unidentified Objects]", Bantam, 1969, cited by the 1974 NYT article "Erich von Däniken's genesis"&lt;/ref&gt; According to NYT's Richard R. Lingerman, it is likely that von Däniken obtained these references from UFO books that mentioned them as real documents.&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite news |first= Richard R. |last= Lingeman |title= Erich von Daniken's Genesis |date= 31 March 1974 |work=The New York Times |page= 6 |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20710FF3B5F107A93C3AA1788D85F408785F9 |quote= A lot of ingredients go into that blender, including (...) apocryphal lore. He refers to "The Book of Dzyan", for example, which he helpfully adds is to be found in "The Secret Doctrine" of Mme. Blavatsky (...) "The Book of Dzyan" exists only in her astral thoughts. (...) Actually, both of these documents have a way of turning up repeatedly in books on flying saucers, which is probably where von Däniken found them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nazca Lines=====
[[File:Líneas de Nazca, Nazca, Perú, 2015-07-29, DD 52.JPG|thumb|Some of the Nazca lines.]]
Von Däniken brought the [[Nazca Lines]] to public prominence in ''Chariots of the Gods?''&lt;ref name="nickell"/&gt; with his proposal that the lines were built on instructions from extraterrestrial beings as airfields for their spaceships.&lt;ref name="silverman"/&gt; In his 1998 book ''Arrival of The Gods'', he added that some of the pictures depicted extraterrestrials.&lt;ref name="silverman"/&gt; The idea did not originate with von Däniken; it began after people who first saw the lines from the air made joking comparisons to Martian "canals",&lt;ref name="nickell"&gt;{{citation |title= Unsolved history: investigating mysteries of the past |author= Joe Nickell |edition= illustrated |publisher= University Press of Kentucky |year= 2005 |page= 9 |isbn= 978-0-8131-9137-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4AvLk27YJk8C&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=erich+von+daniken+nazca&amp;hl=en |quote= It is difficult to take von Däniken seriously, especially since his "theory" is not his own and it originated in jest. Wrote [[Paul Kosok]], the first to study the markings: "When first viewed from the air, [the lines] were nicknamed prehistoric landing fields and jokingly compared with the so-called canals of Mars"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had already been published by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The skeptic's dictionary: a collection of strange beliefs, amusing deceptions, and dangerous delusions |author= Robert Todd Carroll |edition= illustrated |publisher= John Wiley and Sons |year= 2003 |isbn= 978-0-471-27242-7 |page= 248 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BsH2glWLI7UC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=erich+von+daniken+nazca&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3eYWT-OlIoXOhAfCuYCEAw&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=erich%20von%20daniken%20nazca&amp;f=false |quote= Erich von Däniken thinks that the Nazca lines formed an airfield for ancient astronauts, an idea first proposed by James W. Moseley in the October 1955 issue of ''Fate'' and made popular in the early 60's by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier in ''The Mornings of the Magicians''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptions of some Nazca line photos in ''Chariots of the Gods?'' contain significant inaccuracies. One, for example, purporting to demonstrate markings of a modern airport, was actually the knee joint of one of the bird figures, and was quite small in size. Von Däniken said that this was an "error" in the first edition, but it has not been corrected in later editions.&lt;ref name="nickell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= The Case of the Ancient Astronauts |series= Horizon |serieslink= Horizon (BBC TV series) |network= [[BBC]] |airdate= 3 August 1978|time= 33:10–34:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consensus among archeologists is that the Nazca lines were created by [[pre-Columbian]] civilizations for cultural purposes.  Efforts by archeologists to refute fringe theories such as Däniken's have been minimal, however.&lt;ref name="silverman"/&gt; Silverman and Proulx have said that this silence from archaeologists has harmed the profession, as well as the [[Peru]]vian nation.&lt;ref name="silverman"&gt;{{citation |title= The Nasca |chapter= The "Mythological" History of the Geoglyphs |series= Peoples of America |author= Helaine Silverman, Donald Proulx |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-470-69266-0 |pages= 167–171 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Hi6Epz6SRwAC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;q=daniken |quote= (...) many speculative explanations have been proposed for the function of the geoglyphs.

=====Piri Reis map=====
[[File:1513 Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|The Piri Reis map.]]
Von Däniken wrote in ''Chariots of the Gods?'' that a version of the [[Piri Reis map]] depicted some Antarctic mountains that were and still are buried in ice, and could only be mapped with modern equipment. His theory relies on the book of ''Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings'' by [[Charles Hapgood]]. A.D. Crown, in ''Some Trust in Chariots'', explains how this is simply wrong. The map in von Däniken's book only extends five [[Geographic coordinate system|degrees]] south of the equator, ending in [[Cape São Roque]], which means that it doesn't extend to Antarctica. Von Däniken also said that the map showed some distortions that would only happen if it was an aerial view taken from a spaceship flying above El Cairo, but in fact it doesn't extend far enough to the south to cause visible distortions in an aerial view. Von Däniken also asserts the existence of a legend saying that a god gave the map to a priest, the god being an extraterrestrial being. But [[Piri Reis]] said that he had drawn that map himself using older maps, and the map is consistent with the cartographic knowledge of that time.&lt;ref&gt;"Report No. 83-205 SPR The UFO Enigma, Marcia S.

=====Pyramid of Cheops=====
[[File:Snefru's Bent Pyramid in Dahshur.jpg|thumb|The Bent Pyramid.]]
Erich von Däniken puts forward many beliefs about the Great Pyramid of Giza in his 1968 book Chariots of the Gods, saying that the ancient Egyptians did not have the most advanced tools to actually build the Pyramid, there is no evidence of workers, and there is too much 'intimate' knowledge about the Earth and its geography for the Egyptians to build the pyramid in that exact location. However, the technique of construction is well understood, the tools the Egyptians used are known, marks left in the quarries by those tools are still visible, and many examples of the tools are preserved in museums. Von Däniken claims that it would have taken the Egyptians too long to cut all the blocks necessary and drag them to the construction site in time to build the Great Pyramid in only 20 years; but a Nova documentary demonstrates how quickly a block of stone can be cut with the available tools and shows examples of the rollers used in their transportation. von Däniken also said that there were too many problems with their tools, and, according to him, the Egyptians had no prehistory so they could not have possibly built these large pyramids, even though there are pyramids in Egypt that were built before the Great Pyramid. Because he believed that there was no prehistory, von Däniken put forward that there is nothing known about how, when, or why these pyramids were built&lt;ref name="von Däniken"&gt;von Däniken, Erich. Chariots of the Gods? Effone Electronici Press, 1968, pp. 74–121, anthropology.msu.edu/anp364-fs17/files/2012/08/Erich.Von_.Daniken.Chariots.Of_.The_.Gods_.BD_.pdf. Accessed 2 Nov. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;. Von Däniken also claims that Egyptians built perfect pyramids from the beginning, but numerous pyramid precursors survive, showing the errors made, and corrected, by Egyptian architects while they were perfecting the technique.  These include simple [[mastaba]]s, the [[Step Pyramid of Djoser]], and the so-called [[Bent Pyramid]]. Not only that, but in his book, he says that there is no evidence of Egyptian workers so they had to have outside help &lt;ref name="von Däniken" /&gt;; however, archaeologists have found evidence of buildings that workers would have resided in&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;Webster, Gary.

Von Däniken claims that the height of the Cheops pyramid multiplied by one million is the distance to the Sun. In fact the calculation produces a figure of only 91,000 miles. Not only that, but he notes that the Great Pyramid is located on the Median line, divides the continents&lt;ref name="von Däniken" /&gt;, and that the Egyptians could not align the edges so perfectly to true North without advanced technology that only aliens could give them. Egyptian builders, however, knew of simple methods to find North via star observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= The Case of the Ancient Astronauts |series= Horizon |serieslink= Horizon (BBC TV series) |network= [[BBC]] |airdate= 3 August 1978|time= 07:20-17:05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=====Sarcophagus of Palenque=====
[[File:Pacal the Great tomb lid.svg|thumb|The lid of the sarcophagus.]]
Von Däniken claimed that the [[Temple of the Inscriptions#Sarcophagus|Sarcophagus of Palenque]] depicted a spaceman sitting on a rocket-powered spaceship, wearing a spacesuit. However, archaeologists see nothing special about the figure, a dead [[Maya civilization|Maya]] monarch ([[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]]) wearing traditional Maya hairstyle and jewellery, surrounded by Maya symbols that can be observed in other Maya drawings. The right hand is not handling any rocket controls, but simply making a traditional Maya gesture that other figures in the sides of the lid also make, and is not holding anything. The rocket shape is actually two serpents joining their heads at the bottom, with the rocket "flames" being the beards of the serpents. The rocket motor under the figure is the face of a monster, symbol of the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= The Case of the Ancient Astronauts |series= Horizon |serieslink= Horizon (BBC TV series) |network= [[BBC]] |airdate= 3 August 1978|time= 17:20-25:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In "Chariots of the Gods?" Von Däniken also incorrectly states the sculpture to be from [[Copan]], rather than [[Palenque]].)

=====Peruvian stones=====
Von Däniken put forward photographs of ancient stones in Peru, with carvings of men using telescopes, detailed world maps, and advanced medical operations, all beyond the knowledge of ancient Peruvians. But the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television series ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' determined that the stones were modern, and located the potter who made them. This potter makes stones daily and sells them to tourists. Von Däniken had visited the potter and examined the stones himself, but he didn't mention this in his book. He says that he didn't believe the potter when he said that he had made the stones. Von Däniken says that he asked Doctor Cabrera, a local surgeon who owns the museum, and Cabrera had told him that the potter's claims were a lie and that the stones were ancient. But the potter had proof that Cabrera had thanked him for providing the stones for the museum. Von Däniken claimed that the stones at the museum were very different from those made by the potter, but the Nova reporters oversaw the manufacturing of one stone and confirmed that it was very similar to those in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= The Case of the Ancient Astronauts |series= Horizon |serieslink= Horizon (BBC TV series) |network= [[BBC]] |airdate= 3 August 1978 |time= 42:15–47:20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====European ethnocentrism=====

=====Other criticisms=====
Ronald Story published ''[[The Space Gods Revealed: A Close Look At The Theories of Erich Von Däniken]]'' in 1976, written in response to the evidence presented in von Däniken's ''Chariots of the Gods?''. It was reviewed as "a coherent and much-needed refutation of von Däniken's theories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=R.Z. Sheppard |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914468,00.html |title=Books: Worlds in Collusion |work=Time |date=2 August 1976 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archeologist [[Clifford Wilson]] wrote two books similarly debunking von Däniken: ''Crash Go the Chariots'' in 1972 and ''The Chariots Still Crash'' in 1975.

A 2004 article in ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic Magazine]]'' states that von Däniken took many of the book's concepts from ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'', that this book in turn was heavily influenced by the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], and that the core of the ancient astronaut theory originates in [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s stories "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]" written in 1926, and ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' written in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= An investigation into H.P.

=====Response to criticism=====
Speaking in a 2001 documentary, von Däniken said that although he could not conclusively prove to the scientific community that any of the items in his archive were of alien origin, he felt that "today's science" would not accept such evidence, as "the time is simply not right". He argued that it was first necessary to "prepare" mankind for a "wonderful new world"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |title= Loving The Alien: The Real Erich von Däniken |credits=Director: Ralph Lee |network= [[Channel 4]] |airdate= 3 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a point, von Daniken said, before an audience, that, in his younger years, he had not been as rigorous in his research as he might have been. The documentary during which he said this can be watched, from time to time, on the H2 channel.

==Popularity==

According to von Däniken, subsequent books in his series have been translated into 32 languages and together have sold more than 63 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Feder, ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum'', p. 267 (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-313-37918-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jungfrau Park located near Interlaken, Switzerland, was opened as the [[Mystery Park]] in 2003. Designed by von Däniken, it explored several great "mysteries" of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Atwood, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/switzerland/729363/Switzerland-Journey-into-the-unknown.html "Switzerland: Journey into the unknown"] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 29 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ridley Scott]] said that his film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' is related to some of von Däniken's ideas regarding early human civilization.&lt;ref name="Danikeninspiration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openminds.tv/ridley-scotts-alien-movie-prometheus-inspired-by-erich-von-daniken-835/|title=Ridley Scott’s alien movie ‘Prometheus’ inspired by Erich von Däniken|last=McClellan|first=Jason|publisher=OpenMinds|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the two-disc DVD release of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', Dean Devlin referred to the "Is There a Stargate?" feature where "author Erich von Däniken discusses evidence he has found of alien visitations to Earth."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 22 February 2003, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Däniken is an occasional presenter on the History Channel and H2 show ''[[Ancient Aliens]]'', where he talks about aspects of his theories as they pertain to each episode.

Von Däniken is a member of the [[Swiss Writers Association]], the [[German Writers Association]] and the [[International PEN Club]]. He was awarded with an [[honorary doctorate]] by the [[La Universidad Boliviana]]. He received the [[Huesped Illustre]] award from the cities of Ica and Nazca in Peru. In Brazil he received the [[Lourenco Filho award]] in Gold and Platinum, and in Germany he was awarded with the [[Order of Cordon Bleu du Saint Esprit]] (together with the German astronaut Ulf Merbold). In 2004, he was awarded the [[Explorers Festival]] prize.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6044">'''Geoffroi Jacques Flach''' (February 16, 1846 – December 4, 1919) was a [[France|French]] [[jurist]] and [[historian]] born at [[Strasbourg]], [[Alsace]], of a family known at least as early as the 16th century, when [[Sigismond Flach]] was the first professor of law at [[University of Strasbourg]].

G.J. Flach studied classics and [[law]] at Strasbourg, and in 1869 took his degree of doctor of law. In his theses as well as in his early writings such as ''De la subrogation réelle, La Bonorum possessio'', and ''Sur la durée des effets de la minorité'' (1870) he endeavored to explain the problems of laws by means of history, an idea which was new to France at that time. The [[Franco-Prussian War]] engaged Flach's activities in other directions, and he spent two years (described in his ''Strasbourg après le bombardment'', 1873) at work on the rebuilding of the library and the museum, which had been destroyed by [[Prussia]]n shells.

When the time came for him to choose between [[Germany]] and France, he settled definitely in [[Paris]], where he completed his scientific training at the [[École des Chartes]] and the [[École des Hautes Études]]. Having acted for some time as secretary to [[Jules Sénard]], ex-president of the [[Constituent Assembly]], he published an original paper on artistic copyright, but as soon as possible resumed the history of law. In 1879 he became assistant to the jurist [[Édouard René de Laboulaye]] at the [[Collège de France]], and succeeded him in 1884 in the chair of comparative legislation.

Since 1877 he had been professor of comparative law at the free school of the political sciences. To qualify himself for these two positions he had to study the most diverse civilizations, including those of the East and Far East (e.g. [[Hungary]], [[Russia]] and [[Japan]]) and even the antiquities of [[Babylon]]ia and other Asiatic countries. Some of his lectures have been published, particularly those concerning [[Ireland]]: ''Histoire du régime agraire de l'Irlande'' (1883); ''Considérations sur l'histoire politique de l'Irlande'' (1885); and ''Jonathan Swift, son action politique en Irlande'' (1886).

His chief efforts, however, were concentrated on the history of ancient French law. A celebrated [[lawsuit]] in Alsace, pleaded by his friend and compatriot Ignace Chauffour, aroused his interest by reviving the question of the origin of the feudal laws, and gradually led him to study the formation of those laws and the early growth of the feudal system. His great work, ''Les Origines de l'ancienne France'', was produced slowly. In the first volume, ''Le Régime seigneurial'' (1886), he depicts the triumph of [[individualism]] and [[Anarchism|anarchy]], showing how, after [[Charlemagne]]'s great but sterile efforts to restore the Roman principle of sovereignty, the great landowners gradually monopolized the various functions in the state; how society modelled on antiquity disappeared; and how the only living organisms were vassalage and clientship.

The second volume, ''Les Origines communales, et féodalité et la chevalerie'' (1893), deals with the reconstruction of society on new bases which took place in the 10th and 11th centuries. It explains how the Gallo-Roman villa gave place to the village, with its fortified castle, the residence of the lord; how new towns were formed by the side of old, some of which disappeared; how the townspeople united in corporations; and how the communal bond proved to be a powerful instrument of cohesion. At the same time it traces the birth of [[feudalism]] from the germs of the Gallo-Roman personal comitalus; and shows how the bond that united the different parties was the contract of the [[fief]]; and how, after a slow growth of three centuries, feudalism was definitely organized in the 12th century.

In 1904 appeared the third volume, ''La Renaissance de l'État'', in which the author describes the efforts of the [[House of Capet|Direct Capetian]] kings to reconstruct the power of [[List of Frankish Kings|the Frankish kings]] over the whole of [[Gaul]]; and goes on to show how the clergy, the heirs of the imperial tradition, encouraged this ambition; how the great lords of the kingdom (the "princes", as Flach calls them), whether as allies or foes, pursued the same end; and how, before the close of the 12th century, the Capetian kings were in possession of the organs and the means of action which were to render them so powerful and bring about the early downfall of feudalism.

In these three volumes, which appeared at long intervals, the author's theories are not always in complete harmony, nor are they always presented in a very luminous or coherent manner, but they are marked by originality and vigour. Flach gave them a solid basis by the wide range of his researches, utilizing charters and [[cartularies]] (published and unpublished), chronicles, lives of saints, and even those dangerous guides, the ''[[chansons de geste]]''.

He owed little to the historians of feudalism, who knew what feudalism was, but not how it came about. He pursued the same method in his ''L'Origine de l'habitation et des lieux habités en France'' (1899), in which he discusses some of the theories circulated by [[A Meitzen]] in Germany and by [[Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville|Arbois de Jubainville]] in France. Following in the footsteps of the jurist [[Friedrich Karl von Savigny|F. K. von Savigny]], Flach studied the teaching of law in the Middle Ages and the [[Renaissance]], and produced ''Cujas les glossateurs et les Bartolistes'' (1883), and ''Études critiques sur l'histoire du droit romain au moyen âge, avec textes inédits'' (1890).

'''Grayson''' is a town in [[Okmulgee County, Oklahoma|Okmulgee County]], [[Oklahoma]], United States. The population was 159 at the 2010 census, an increase of 18.7 percent from 134 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://censusviewer.com/city/OK/Grayson CensusViewer:Population of the City of Grayson, Oklahoma]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Hagar'' originates from the Book of Genesis; she is acknowledged in all [[Abrahamic religions]]. Hagar is alluded to in the [[Quran]], and Islam considers her Abraham's second wife.

==Hagar in Genesis==
''This is a summary of the account of Hagar from {{bibleverse||Genesis|16|HE}} and 21.''

=== Hagar and Abraham ===
Hagar was the Egyptian slave of Sarah, Abraham's wife. Sarah had been barren for a long time and sought a way to fulfill [[Covenant (biblical)#Abrahamic covenant|God's promise to Abraham]] that Abraham would be father of many nations, especially since they were getting older, so she offered Hagar to Abraham as a second wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|16:1-3|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagar became pregnant, and tension arose between the two women.  Sarah complained to Abraham, and treated Hagar harshly, and Hagar ran away.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|16:4-6|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagar fled into the desert on her way to [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]]. At a spring en route, an [[Angels in Judaism#Angels as messengers|angel]] appeared to Hagar, who instructed her to return to Sarah, so that she may bear a child who "shall be a wild ass of a man: his hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren" ({{bibleverse||Genesis|16:12|HE}}). Then she was told to call her son [[Ishmael]]. Afterward, Hagar referred to God as "[[El Roi]]".&lt;ref&gt;13 And she called the name of the {{LORD}} that spoke unto her, Thou art a God of seeing; for she said: 'Have I even here seen Him that seeth Me?' {{bibleverse||Genesis|16:13|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then returned to Abraham and Sarah, and soon gave birth to a son, whom she named as the angel had instructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|16:7–16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hagar cast out===
[[File:Francesco Cozza 001.jpg|thumb|254px| Hagar and the Angel in the Wilderness, by [[Francesco Cozza (painter)|Francesco Cozza]] ]]

Later, Sarah gave birth to [[Isaac]], and the tension between the women returned. At a celebration after Isaac was weaned, Sarah found the teenage Ishmael mocking her son. She was so upset by it that she demanded that Abraham send Hagar and her son away. She declared that Ishmael would not share in Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed but God told Abraham to do as his wife commanded because God's promise would be carried out through both Isaac and Ishmael.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|21:9–13|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early the next morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. Abraham gave Hagar bread and water then sent them into the wilderness of [[Beersheba]]. She and her son wandered aimlessly until their water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she burst into tears. God heard her and her son crying and came to rescue them.&lt;ref name=21-18&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|21:18|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The angel opened Hagar's eyes and she saw a well of water.  He also told Hagar that God  "will make a great nation" of Ishmael.&lt;ref name=21-18/&gt;

Hagar found her son a wife from Egypt and they settled in the [[Desert of Paran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|21:14–21|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
===Baha'i traditions===
According to the Baha'i Faith, the [[Báb]] was a descendant of Abraham and Hagar,&lt;ref&gt;''Apocalypse Secrets: Baha'i Interpretation of the Book of Revelation'', p. 219, John Able (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and God made a promise to spread Abraham's seed. The Baha'i Publishing House released a text on the wives and concubines of Abraham and traces their lineage to five different religions.&lt;ref&gt;''Spirit of Faith: The Oneness of Humanity'', p. 142, Baha'i Publishing  (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[Image:Tiepolo, Giovanni Battista - Hagar in the Wilderness - 1726-29.jpg|thumb|right|Hagar in the Wilderness by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].]]

In the [[New Testament]], [[Paul the Apostle]] made Hagar's experience an allegory of the difference between law and grace in his [[Epistle to the Galatians]] ({{bibleverse||Galatians|4:21–31|KJV}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Zondervan Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', 2011, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; Paul links the laws of the [[Torah]], given on [[Mount Sinai]], to the bondage of the Israelite people, implying that it was signified by Hagar's condition as a bondswoman, while the "free" heavenly Jerusalem is signified by Sarah and her child. The [[Biblical Mount Sinai]] has been referred to as "Agar", possibly named after Hagar.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Forster (1844). ''The Historical Geography of Arabia'', Duncan and Malcolm, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] referred to Hagar as symbolizing an "earthly city", or sinful condition of humanity: "In the earthly city (symbolised by Hagar) ... we find two things, its own obvious presence and the symbolic presence of the heavenly city. New citizens are begotten to the earthly city by nature vitiated by sin but to the heavenly city by grace freeing nature from sin." (''[[The City of God]]'' 15:2) This view was expounded on by medieval theologians such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[John Wycliffe]]. The latter compared the children of Sarah to the redeemed, and those of Hagar to the unredeemed, who are "carnal by nature and mere exiles".&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;Jeffrey, David L., ''A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1992, p. 326 {{ISBN|0-8028-3634-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Hagar demonstrates that survival is possible even under harshest conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lectio.unibe.ch/04_1/Scholz.Enslaved.htm Susanne Scholz, "Gender, Class, and Androcentric Compliance in the Rapes of Enslaved Women in the Hebrew Bible", ''Lectio Difficilior'' (''European Electronic Journal for Feminist Exegisis''), 1/2004] (see especially section "The Story of Hagar (Genesis 16:1–16; 21:9–21)".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Hagar in Islam}}
[[Hagar in Islam|Hājar or Haajar]] ([[Arabic]]: هاجر), is the Arabic name used to identify the wife of [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrāhīm]] (Abraham) and the mother of [[Ishmael in Islam|Ismā'īl]] (Ishmael). Although not mentioned by name in the [[Qur'an]], she is referenced and alluded to via the story of her husband. She is a revered woman in the [[Islam]]ic faith.

According to [[Muslim]] belief, she was the Egyptian handmaiden of Ibrāhīm's first wife [[Sarah in Islam|Sara]] (Sarah). She eventually settled in the [[Desert of Paran]] with her son Ismā'īl. [[Hagar in Islam|Hājar]] is honoured as an especially important [[Matriarchs (Bible)|matriarch]] of [[monotheism]], as it was through Ismā'īl that [[Muhammad]] would come.

Neither [[Sarah in Islam|Sara]] nor [[Hagar in Islam|Hājar]] are mentioned by name in the Qur'an, but the story is traditionally understood to be referred to in a line from [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrāhīm]]'s prayer in [[Ibrahim (sura)|Sura Ibrahim]] (14:37): "I have settled some of my family in a barren valley near your [[Kaaba|Sacred House]]."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Freyer Stowasser, ''Women in the Qur'an, Traditions, and Interpretation'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; While Hājar is not named, the reader lives Hājar's predicament indirectly through the eyes of Ibrāhīm.&lt;ref name = Fatani&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fatani |first=Afnan H. |contribution=Hajar |year=2006 |title=The Qur'an: an encyclopedia|editor-last=Leaman|editor-first=Oliver |pages=234–36 |place=London |publisher=Routeledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also frequently mentioned in the books of ''[[hadith]]s''.

According to the ''[[Qisas Al-Anbiya]]'', a collection of tales about the prophets, Hājar was the daughter of the King of Maghreb, a descendant of [[Salih]]. Her father was killed by Pharaoh Dhu l-'arsh and she was captured and taken as a slave. Later, because of her royal blood, she was made mistress of the female slaves and given access to all of Pharaoh's wealth. Upon conversion to Ibrāhīm's faith, the Pharaoh gave Hājar to Sara who gave her to Ibrāhīm. In this account, the name "Hājar" (called ''Hajar'' in [[Arabic]]) comes from ''Ha ajruka'', Arabic for "here is your recompense".&lt;ref name = Fatani /&gt;

According to another tradition, Hājar was the daughter of the Egyptian king, who gave her to Ibrāhīm as a wife, thinking Sara was his sister.&lt;ref name = Aishah&gt;{{cite journal |author='Aishah 'Abd al-Rahman, Anthony Calderbank |title=Islam and the New Woman/ ﺍﻹﺳﻼﻡ ﻭﺍﻟﻤﺮﺃﺓ ﺍﻟﺠﺪﻳﺪﺓ |journal=Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics |issue=19 |page=200 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn Abbas]], [[Ishmael in Islam|Ismā'īl]]'s birth to Hājar caused strife between her and Sara, who was still barren. Ibrāhīm brought Hājar and their son to a land called Paran-aram or (Faran in Arabic, in latter days held to be the land surrounding Mecca).&lt;ref name = Firestone /&gt; The objective of this journey was to "resettle" rather than "expel" Hājar.&lt;ref name = Fatani/&gt; Ibrāhīm left Hājar and Ismā'īl under a tree and provided them with water.&lt;ref name = Firestone /&gt; Hājar, learning that God had ordered Ibrāhīm to leave her in the desert of Paran, respected his decision.&lt;ref name = Aishah /&gt; The Muslim belief is that God tested Ibrāhīm by ordering this task.&lt;ref name = Schussman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schussman |first=Aviva |title=The Legitimacy and Nature of Mawid al-Nabī: (Analysis of a Fatwā) |journal=Islamic Law and Society |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=218 |year=1998 |doi=10.1163/1568519982599535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hājar soon ran out of water, and Ismā'īl, an infant by that time, began to cry from hunger/thirst. Hājar panicked and ran between two nearby hills, [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah]], repeatedly in search for water. After her seventh run, an angel appeared over the location of the Zamzam and then hit the ground with his heel (or his wing) and caused a miraculous well to spring out of the ground. This is called the [[Zamzam Well]] and is located a few metres from the [[Kaaba]] in Mecca.&lt;ref name = Firestone&gt;{{cite journal |last=Firestone |first=Reuven |title=[[Abraham in Islam|Ibrāhīm]]'s Journey to Mecca in Islamic Exegesis: A Form-Critical Study of a Tradition |journal=Studia Islamica |issue=76 |pages=15–18 |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident&lt;ref&gt;''Muhammad'', Martin Lings, Chapter 1. ''The House of God'', Suhail Academy Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; of her running between the Al-Safa and Al-Marwah hills is remembered by Muslims when they perform their [[pilgrimage]] ([[Hajj]]) at Mecca. Part of the pilgrimage is to run seven times between the hills, in commemoration of Hājar's courage and faith in God as she searched for water in the desert (which is believed to have then miraculously appeared from the Zamzam Well), and to symbolize the celebration of [[mother]]hood in Islam as well as the leadership of women. To complete the task, some Muslims also drink from the Zamzam Well and take some of the water back home from pilgrimage in memory of Hājar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delaney |first=Carol |title=The ''hajj'': Sacred and Secular |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=17 |issue=3 |page=515 |date=August 1990 |doi=10.1525/ae.1990.17.3.02a00060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbinical commentary===
Rabbinical commentators asserted that Hagar was [[Pharaoh]]'s daughter. The [[midrash]] [[Genesis Rabbah]] states it was when Sarah was in Pharaoh's [[harem]] that he gave her his daughter Hagar as slave, saying: "It is better that my daughter should be a slave in the house of such a woman than mistress in another house". Sarah treated Hagar well, and induced women who came to visit her to visit Hagar also. However Hagar, when pregnant by Abraham, began to act [[hubris|superciliously]] toward Sarah, provoking the latter to treat her harshly, to impose heavy work upon her, and even to strike her (ib. 16:9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=53&amp;letter=H |title=Jewish Encyclopedia, ''Hagar'' |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Jewish commentators identify Hagar with [[Keturah]] ({{lang-arc|קְטוּרָה}} ''Qəṭurɔh''), the woman Abraham married after the death of Sarah, stating that Abraham sought her out after Sarah's death. It is suggested that Keturah was Hagar's personal name, and that "Hagar" was a descriptive label meaning "stranger".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/2636/jewish/The-Return-of-Hagar.htm "The Return of Hagar"], commentary on Parshat [[Chayei Sarah]], [[Chabad]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/chaye/sha.html "Who Was Ketura?"], [[Bar-Ilan University]]'s Parashat Hashavua Study Center, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ou.org/torah/ti/5763/chayeisara63.htm "Parshat Chayei Sarah"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113015839/http://www.ou.org/torah/ti/5763/chayeisara63.htm |date=2008-11-13 }}, ''Torah Insights,'' [[Orthodox Union]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is discussed in the [[Midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Bereshit Rabbah]] 61:4.&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by [[Rashi]], [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]], [[Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz]], and [[Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura]].  Rashi argues that "Keturah" was a name given to Hagar because her deeds were as beautiful as incense (hence: ''ketores''), and/or that she remained chaste from the time she was separated from Abraham—{{lang|arc|קְטוּרָה}} derives from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word "restrained". The contrary view (that Keturah was someone other than Hagar) is advocated by the [[Rashbam]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], [[David Kimhi]], and [[Nachmanides]]. They were listed as two different people in the genealogies in {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|1:29–33|HE}}.

==Arts and literature==
[[File:Jan Mostaert - The Banishment of Hagar.jpg|thumb|''The Banishment of Hagar'' by [[Jan Mostaert]], c. 1520–25, [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]].]]

Many artists have painted scenes from the story of Hagar and Ismael in the desert, including  [[Pieter Lastman]], [[Gustave Doré]], [[Frederick Goodall]] and [[James Eckford Lauder]]. [[William Shakespeare]] refers to Hagar in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' Act II Scene 5 line 40 when Shylock says "What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?" This line refers to the character Launcelot, whom Shylock is insulting by comparing him to the outcast Ishmael. It also reverses the conventional Christian interpretation by portraying the Christian character as the outcast.&lt;ref name=dict /&gt;

Hagar's destitution and desperation are used as an excuse for criminality by characters in the work of [[Daniel Defoe]], such as [[Moll Flanders]], and the conventional view of Hagar as the mother of outcasts is repeated in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s play ''[[Zapolya]]'', whose heroine is assured that she is "no Hagar's offspring; thou art the rightful heir to an appointed king."&lt;ref name=dict /&gt;
[[Image:Cecco Bravo-Hagar and the Angel mg 1780.jpg|thumb|left|''Hagar and the Angel'', by [[Cecco Bravo]]]]

In the nineteenth century a more sympathetic portrayal became prominent, especially in America. [[Edmonia Lewis]], the early [[African-American]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] sculptor, made Hagar the subject of one of her most well-known works. She said it was inspired by "strong sympathy for all women who have struggled and suffered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHyyliXwGl0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=hagar&amp;f=false |title=Feminism-art-theory: an anthology, 1968–2000 |page=230 |last=Robinson |first=Hilary |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2014-05-12 |isbn=9780631208501 |date=2001-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In novels and poems Hagar herself, or characters named Hagar, were depicted as unjustly suffering exiles. These include the long dramatic poem ''Hagar'' by Eliza Jane Poitevent Nicholson ([[pen name]] Pearl Rivers), president of the [[National Woman's Press Association]]; ''Hagar in the Wilderness'' by [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], the highest-paid magazine writer of his day; and ''Hagar's Farewell'' by Augusta Moore.&lt;ref name=dict /&gt; In 1913 this was joined by the overtly feminist novel ''Hagar'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=HAGAR. By Mary Johnston. Houghton Mifflin Company. |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/11/02/100284504.pdf |title=NYT review of Hagar by Johnston |publisher=New York Times |date=1913-11-02 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the American Southern socialist and suffragist Mary Johnston's.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4249261 Mary Johnston, Suffragist Marjorie Spruill Wheeler ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' Vol. 100, No. 1, "Working out Her Destiny": Virginia Women's History (Jan., 1992), pp. 99–118 (article consists of 20 pages), published by Virginia Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hall Caine]] gave the name ''A Son of Hagar'' to 1885 book set in contemporary England and dealing with the theme of [[illegitimacy]].

A similarly sympathetic view prevails in more recent literature. The novel ''[[The Stone Angel]]'' by [[Margaret Laurence]] has a protagonist named Hagar married to a man named Bram, whose life story loosely imitates that of the biblical Hagar. A character named Hagar is prominently featured in [[Toni Morrison]]'s novel ''[[Song of Solomon (novel)|Song of Solomon]]'', which features numerous [[Bible|Biblical]] themes and allusions. Hagar is mentioned briefly in [[Salman Rushdie]]'s controversial novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', where Mecca is replaced with 'Jahilia', a desert village built on sand and served by Hagar's spring. Hagar is mentioned, along with [[Bilhah]] and [[Zilpah]], in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', a controversial [[dystopian]] novel which centres around the women whose duty it is to produce children for their masters, assuming the place of their wives. In the recent book of nonfiction, ''[[Charlotte Gordon|The Woman Who Named God: Abraham's Dilemma and the Birth of Three Faiths]]'', by [[Charlotte Gordon]] provides an account of Hagar's life from the perspectives of the three monotheistic religions, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity.

==Contemporary influence==
===Israel===
Since the 1970s, the custom has arisen of giving the name "Hagar" to newborn female babies. The giving of this name is often taken as a controversial political act, marking the parents as being supporters of reconciliation with the Palestinians and Arab World, and is frowned upon by many, including nationalists and the religious. The connotations of the name were represented by the founding of the Israeli journal ''Hagar: Studies in Culture, Polity and Identities'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Oren Yiftachel, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091008004711/http://hsf.bgu.ac.il/hagar/issues/1_1_2000/1120001.aspx Launching Hagar: Marginality, Beer-Sheva, Critique] Retrieved 2015-10-16&lt;/ref&gt;

===African Americans===
Several [[Black feminism|black American feminists]] have written about Hagar, comparing her story to those of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves in American history]]. Wilma Bailey, in an article entitled "Hagar: A Model for an Anabaptist Feminist", refers to her as a "maidservant" and "slave". She sees Hagar as a model of "power, skills, strength and drive". In the article "A Mistress, A Maid, and No Mercy", [[Renita J. Weems]] argues that the relationship between Sarah and Hagar exhibits "ethnic prejudice exacerbated by economic and social exploitation".&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Wilma Ann ''[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4044/is_200201/ai_n9026537 Black and Jewish women consider Hagar'', ''Encounter'', Winter 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assisted reproduction===
Hagar bearing a child for an infertile woman is an example of what is now called [[surrogacy]] or contractual gestation. Critics of this and other [[assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproductive technologies]] have used Hagar in their analysis. As early as 1988, Anna Goldman-Amirav in ''Reproductive and Genetic Engineering'' wrote of Hagar within "the Biblical 'battle of the wombs' [which] lay the foundation for the view of women, fertility, and sexuality in the patriarchal society".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman-Amirav, Anna (1988). [http://www.finrrage.org/pdf_files/RepTech%20General/Lord_Hath_Restrained-Me-from_Bearing.pdf "Behold, the Lord Hath Restrained Me from Bearing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219231154/http://www.finrrage.org/pdf_files/RepTech%20General/Lord_Hath_Restrained-Me-from_Bearing.pdf |date=2011-02-19 }}, ''Reproductive and Genetic Engineering: Journal of International Feminist Analysis'' Volume 1 Number 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Townsend''' (1815–1886) was an [[Anglican]] [[missionary]] in  [[Nigeria]].  Ordained in England in 1842, Townsend set off for Sierra Leone, landing there that same year.  After working there only a few months, he was transferred to the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] mission.

From 1846 to 1867, he based his mission in [[Abeokuta]].  Thomas Birch Freeman was actually the first European to enter Abeokuta.  He arrived there on 11 December 1843.  When he returned to Badagry on 24 December, he met Rev. Henry Townsend and they celebrated Christmas Day together sharing the Gospel in Badagry.  According to Ajisafe, he was the first European person to enter Abeokuta, arriving there on 4 January 1843 and was 'given a grand reception' (Ajisafe 1924: 85). Working with [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther|Samuel Crowther]], a Yoruba Anglican priest, Townsend wrote several [[hymn]]s in Yoruba and aided in the compilation of Crowther's Yoruba primer.  He retired in 1876.

Reverend Henry Townsend published a Yoruba newspaper in 1859.{{efn| 1 = ''Iwe Irohin'' or ''Iwe Irohin fun awon Ebga''}}  This is said to have started off the print media in Nigeria, the newspaper was first bilingual paper in Nigeria. The paper use 8 years before it demise.

The '''Historic Vehicle Association''' ('''HVA''') was founded in 2009 in America to promote the cultural and historical significance of the automobile, and protect the future of automotive history. The society has been an influential part of the U.S. Department of the Interior's Historic American Engineering Record (a part of the Heritage Documentation Programs), and has helped identify historical significance and excellence in car making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Preston |first1=Benjamin |title=Shelby Cobra Coupe Becomes the First Federally Registered Historic Ca |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/automobiles/collectibles/shelby-cobra-coupe-becomes-the-first-federally-registered-historic-car.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With over 375,000 members, the HVA claims to be the world's largest historic vehicle owners' organization.

HVA was founded with philanthropic support of [[Hagerty Insurance Agency|Hagerty]], and became the designated North American representative of FIVA ([[Fédération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens]]), the international federation of historic vehicle organizations – both for the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiva.org/?page_id=208 Global Members – FIVA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HVAabout&gt;[https://www.historicvehicle.org/about-us/ About the HVA - Historic Vehicle Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allen brothers—[[Augustus Chapman Allen|Augustus Chapman]] and [[John Kirby Allen|John Kirby]]—explored town sites on [[Buffalo Bayou]] and [[Galveston Bay]]. According to historian David McComb, "[T]he brothers, on August 26, 1836, bought from Elizabeth E. Parrott, wife of T.F.L. Parrott and widow of John Austin, the south half of the lower league [{{convert|2214|acre|ha|adj=on}} tract] granted to her by her late husband. They paid $5,000 total, but only $1,000 of this in cash; notes made up the remainder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Houston: A History|author=David G. McComb|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|year=1981|edition=2nd|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allen brothers ran their first advertisement for Houston just four days later in the ''Telegraph and Texas Register'', naming the notional town in honor of President [[Sam Houston]].&lt;ref name="HouHTO" /&gt; They successfully lobbied the Republic of Texas Congress to designate Houston as the temporary capital, agreeing to provide the new government with a capital building.&lt;ref name="tsha_AC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Allen, Augustus Chapman|author=Amelia W.

In 1839, the Republic of Texas relocated its capital to [[Austin]]. The town suffered another setback that year when a yellow fever epidemic claimed about one life out of every eight residents. Yet it persisted as a commercial center, forming a symbiosis with its Gulf Coast port, [[Galveston]]. Landlocked farmers brought their produce to Houston, using [[Buffalo Bayou]] to gain access to Galveston and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Houston merchants profited from selling staples to farmers and shipping the farmers' produce to Galveston.&lt;ref name=HouHTO/&gt;

The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. [[New Orleans]] was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but slave dealers were in Houston. Thousands of [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] blacks lived near the city before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs.

In 1840, the community established a chamber of commerce in part to promote shipping and navigation at the newly created port on Buffalo Bayou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.houstontx.gov/savvy/archives/sum06/sum06_heritage.htm |first =John |last =Perry|title =Born on the Bayou: city's murky start|deadurl =yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218055155/http://www.houstontx.gov/savvy/archives/sum06/sum06_heritage.htm |archivedate=December 18, 2011 |work=City Savvy|edition =Online|date = Summer 2006|publisher = City of Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1860, Houston had emerged as a commercial and [[Railroad|railroad hub]] for the export of cotton.&lt;ref name="SHQa4" /&gt; Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met rail lines to the ports of [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] and [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]]. During the [[American Civil War]], Houston served as a headquarters for General [[John B. Magruder|John Magruder]], who used the city as an organization point for the [[Battle of Galveston]].&lt;ref name="Sabine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cotham|first=Edward T.|title=Sabine Pass: The Confederacy's Thermopylae|year=2004|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=0-292-70594-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Civil War, Houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of Galveston. By 1890, Houston was the railroad center of Texas.

In 1900, after Galveston was struck by a devastating [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900|hurricane]], efforts to make Houston into a viable deep-water port were accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/governors/rising/sayers-galv.html J.H.W.

President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence.

In 1945, the M.D. Anderson Foundation formed the [[Texas Medical Center]]. After the war, Houston's economy reverted to being primarily port-driven.

These [[sediment]]s consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of [[halite]], a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into [[salt dome]] formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hch07 Harris County].

===Cityscape===
{{further|Geographic areas of Houston|List of Houston neighborhoods}}
Houston was incorporated in 1837 and adopted a [[Ward (politics)|ward system]] of representation shortly afterward in 1840.&lt;ref name="Trapp"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Betty Trapp|date=Fall 2010|title=A System of Government Where Business Ruled|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ward-system-of-government.pdf|journal=Houston History Magazine|volume=8|pages=29–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six original wards of Houston are the progenitors of the 11 modern-day geographically-oriented [[Houston City Council]] districts, though the city abandoned the ward system in 1905 in favor of a [[City commission government|commission government]], and, later, the existing [[mayor–council government]].

Locations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate&amp;nbsp;610 loop]]. The "Inner Loop" encompasses a {{Convert|97|mi2|km2|adj=on}} area which includes Downtown, pre–World War II residential neighborhoods and [[streetcar suburb]]s, and newer high-density apartment and townhouse developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstontx.gov/planning/Demographics/Loop%20610%20Website/population.html|title=Houston's Loop 610: Population|last=|first=|date=2013|website=City of Houston|publisher=City of Houston Planning and Development Department|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the loop, the city's typology is more [[Suburbanization|suburban]], though many major business districts—such as [[Uptown Houston|Uptown]], [[Westchase, Houston|Westchase]], and the [[Houston Energy Corridor|Energy Corridor]]—lie well outside the urban core. In addition to Interstate 610, two additional loop highways encircle the city: [[Texas State Highway Beltway 8|Beltway 8]], with a radius of approximately {{convert|10|mi|km}} from Downtown, and [[Texas State Highway 99|State Highway 99]] (the Grand Parkway), with a radius of {{Convert|25|mi|km}}. Approximately 470,000 people live within the Interstate 610 loop, while 1.65 million live between Interstate 610 and Beltway 8 and 2.25 million live within Harris County outside Beltway 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.harriscountytx.gov/CmpDocuments/74/Budget/FY16%20Population%20Study.pdf|title=Harris County Budget Management: Population Study|last=|first=|date=January 2015|website=Harris County, Texas|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411074852/http://www.harriscountytx.gov/CmpDocuments/74/Budget/FY16%20Population%20Study.pdf|archive-date=2015-04-11|dead-url=yes|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Houston is the largest city in the United States without formal [[zoning]] regulations, it has developed similarly to other [[Sun Belt]] cities because the city's land use regulations and [[Covenant (law)#In a legal context|legal covenants]] have played a similar role.&lt;ref name=nytzoning&gt;{{cite news | title = FOCUS: Houston; A Fresh Approach To Zoning | work=New York Times | accessdate = March 27, 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/17/realestate/focus-houston-a-fresh-approach-to-zoning.html | first=Robert | last=Reinhold | date=August 17, 1986

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations include mandatory lot size for single-family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants and customers. Such restrictions have had mixed results. Though some have blamed the city's low density, [[urban sprawl]], and lack of pedestrian-friendliness on these policies, the city's land use has also been credited with having significant affordable housing, sparing Houston the worst effects of the [[United States housing bubble|2008 real estate crisis]].&lt;ref name=nozoning/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Lack of zoning has paid off for Houston|work=chron.com, Houston Chronicle|date= May 27, 2008|accessdate=March 27, 2009|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/steffy/5804649.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city issued 42,697 building permits in 2008 and was ranked first in the list of healthiest housing markets for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Healthiest Housing Markets for 2009 – Local Markets, Construction, Home Prices | work=Builder Magazine | date = February 27, 2009 | accessdate = March 4, 2009 | url = http://www.builderonline.com/local-markets/the-healthiest-housing-markets-for-2009.aspx?page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voters rejected efforts to have separate residential and commercial land-use districts in 1948, 1962, and 1993. Consequently, rather than a single central business district as the center of the city's employment, multiple districts have grown throughout the city in addition to [[Downtown Houston|Downtown]], which include [[Uptown Houston|Uptown]], [[Texas Medical Center|Texas&amp;nbsp;Medical&amp;nbsp;Center]], [[Midtown, Houston, Texas|Midtown]], [[Greenway Plaza|Greenway&amp;nbsp;Plaza]], [[Memorial City]], [[Houston Energy Corridor|Energy Corridor]], [[Westchase, Houston, Texas|Westchase]], and [[Greenspoint, Houston, Texas|Greenspoint]].

In the 1960s, [[Downtown Houston]] consisted of a collection of midrise office structures. Downtown was on the threshold of an energy industry{{ndash}}led boom in 1970. A succession of skyscrapers was built throughout the 1970s—many by real estate developer [[Gerald D. Hines]]—culminating with Houston's tallest skyscraper, the 75-floor, {{convert|1002|ft|m|0|adj=on}}-tall [[JPMorgan Chase Tower (Houston)|JPMorgan Chase Tower]] (formerly the Texas Commerce Tower), completed in 1982. It is the tallest structure in Texas, [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|15th tallest]] building in the United States, and the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|85th-tallest]] skyscraper in the world, based on highest architectural feature. In 1983, the 71-floor, {{convert|992|ft|m|0|adj=on}}-tall [[Wells Fargo Plaza (Houston)|Wells Fargo Plaza]] (formerly Allied Bank Plaza) was completed, becoming the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas. Based on highest architectural feature, it is the 17th-tallest in the United States and the 95th-tallest in the world. In 2007, Downtown had over 43&amp;nbsp;million square feet (4,000,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of office space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstondowntown.com/Home/GeneralInfo/About/FastFacts1/ Fast Facts, Downtown Houston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205170813/http://www.houstondowntown.com/Home/GeneralInfo/About/FastFacts1/ |date=December 5, 2009 }}.

Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the [[Uptown Houston|Uptown District]] boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of midrise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along Interstate&amp;nbsp;610 West. Uptown became one of the most prominent instances of an [[edge city]]. The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, {{convert|901|ft|m|0|adj=on}}-tall, [[Philip Johnson]] and [[John Burgee]] designed landmark [[Williams Tower]] (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the world's tallest skyscraper outside a central business district.

Economist and vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership Patrick Jankowski attributed Houston's success to the ability of the region's real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes. Furthermore, Jankowski stated that "more than 100 foreign-owned companies relocated, expanded or started new businesses in Houston" between 2008 and 2010, and this openness to external business boosted job creation during a period when domestic demand was problematically low.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt; Also in 2013, Houston again appeared on ''Forbes''' list of Best Places for Business and Careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Places For Business and Careers – Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/best-places-for-business/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

Houston is considered to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between Republicans and Democrats. Much of the city's wealthier areas vote Republican while the city's working class and minority areas vote Democratic. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68&amp;nbsp;percent of non-Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor Republicans while 89 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in the area are declared or favor Democrats.

Houston is the seat of the internationally renowned Texas Medical Center, which contains the world's largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Texas Medical Center – Largest Medical Center (Video HD (English)) |work=Texas Medical Center |accessdate=March 28, 2009 |url=http://www.texmedctr.tmc.edu/root/en/GetToKnow/TMCVideo/Largest+Medical+Center+Video+%28HD-English%29.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623134855/http://www.texmedctr.tmc.edu/root/en/GetToKnow/TMCVideo/Largest%2BMedical%2BCenter%2BVideo%2B%28HD-English%29.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All 49 member institutions of the Texas Medical Center are non-profit organizations. They provide patient and preventive care, research, education, and local, national, and international community well-being.
Employing more than 73,600 people, institutions at the medical center include 13 hospitals and two specialty institutions, two medical schools, four nursing schools, and schools of dentistry, public health, pharmacy, and virtually all health-related careers. It is where one of the first—and still the largest—air emergency service, [[Memorial Hermann Life Flight|Life Flight]], was created, and a very successful inter-institutional transplant program was developed. More heart surgeries are performed at the Texas Medical Center than anywhere else in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Medical Center |work=www.visithoustontexas.com |url=http://www.visithoustontexas.com/media/statistics/Houston_Stats_Texas_Medical_Center |accessdate=February 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208100707/http://www.visithoustontexas.com/media/statistics/Houston_Stats_Texas_Medical_Center |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the region's high rate of automobile usage, attitudes towards transportation among Houstonians indicate a growing preference for [[walkability]]. A 2017 study by the [[Rice University]] Kinder Institute for Urban Research found that 56% of Harris County residents have a preference for dense housing in a mixed-use, walkable setting as opposed to single-family housing in a low-density area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kinder.rice.edu/uploadedFiles/Kinder_Institute_for_Urban_Research/HAS/2017%20Kinder%20Houston%20Area%20Survey%20FINAL.pdf|title=The Kinder Houston Area Survey: Thirty-Six Years of Measuring Responses to a Changing America|last=Klineberg|first=Stephen L.|date=May 2017|website=Kinder Institute for Urban Research, Rice University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013234123/http://kinder.rice.edu/uploadedFiles/Kinder_Institute_for_Urban_Research/HAS/2017%20Kinder%20Houston%20Area%20Survey%20FINAL.pdf|archive-date=October 13, 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=March 19, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plurality of survey respondents also indicated that traffic congestion was the most significant problem facing the metropolitan area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, many households in the City of Houston have no car.

===Roadways===

[[File:45intoI-10 2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Interstate 10 in Texas|Interstate 10]] and [[Interstate 45]] [[stack interchange]] northwest of Downtown Houston.]] 
The eight-county Greater Houston metropolitan area contains over {{Convert|25000|mi|km}} of roadway, of which 10%, or approximately {{Convert|2500|mi|km}}, is [[Limited-access road|limited-access highway]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.h-gac.com/taq/plan/2040/docs/2040-RTP-revised-April-2016.pdf|title=2040 Regional Transportation Plan|last=|first=|date=March 30, 2016|website=Houston-Galveston Area Council (HGAC)|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Houston region's extensive freeway system handles over 40% of the regional [[Units of transportation measurement|daily vehicle miles traveled]] (VMT).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Arterial road]]s handle an additional 40% of daily VMT, while [[toll road]]s, of which Greater Houston has {{Convert|180|mi|km}}, handle nearly 10%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Greater Houston possesses a [[Spoke–hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke]] limited-access highway system, in which a number of freeways radiate outward from Downtown, with [[ring road]]s providing connections between these radial highways at intermediate distances from the city center. The city is crossed by three [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]], [[Interstate 10 in Texas|Interstate 10]], [[Interstate 45]], and [[Interstate 69]] (commonly known as [[U.S. Route 59]]), as well as a number of other [[United States Numbered Highway System|United States routes]] and [[Texas state highway system|state highways]]. Major freeways in Greater Houston are often referred to by either the cardinal direction or geographic location they travel towards. Highways that follow the cardinal convention include [[U.S. Route 290]] (''Northwest Freeway''), Interstate 45 north of Downtown (''North Freeway''), Interstate 10 east of Downtown ''(East Freeway''), [[Texas State Highway 288]] (''South'' ''Freeway''), and Interstate 69 south of Downtown (''Southwest Freeway''). Highways that follow the location convention include Interstate 10 west of Downtown (''[[Katy, Texas|Katy]] Freeway''), Interstate 69 north of Downtown (''[[East Texas|Eastex]] Freeway''), Interstate 45 south of Downtown (''[[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] Freeway''), and [[Texas State Highway 225]] (''[[La Porte, Texas|La Porte]]'' or ''[[Pasadena, Texas|Pasadena]] Freeway'').

Three loop freeways provide north-south and east-west connectivity between Greater Houston's radial highways. The innermost loop is [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate 610]], commonly known as the ''Inner Loop'', which encircles Downtown, the [[Texas Medical Center]], [[Greenway Plaza]], the cities of [[West University Place, Texas|West University Place]] and [[Southside Place, Texas|Southside Place]], and many core neighborhoods. The {{Convert|88|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Texas State Highway Beltway 8|State Highway Beltway&amp;nbsp;8]], often referred to as ''the Beltway'', forms the middle loop at a radius of roughly {{Convert|10|mi|km}}. A third, {{Convert|180|mi|km|adj=on}} loop with a radius of approximately {{Convert|25|mi|km}}, [[Texas State Highway 99|State Highway&amp;nbsp;99]] (the ''Grand Parkway''), is currently under construction, with six of eleven segments completed {{as of|2018|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/projects/studies/houston/sh99-grand-parkway.html|title=SH 99 / Grand Parkway Project|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Texas Department of Transportation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304020957/https://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/projects/studies/houston/sh99-grand-parkway.html|archive-date=March 4, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completed segments D through G provide a continuous {{Convert|70.4|mi|km|adj=on}} limited-access tollway connection between [[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]], [[Katy, Texas|Katy]], [[Cypress, Texas|Cypress]], [[Spring, Texas|Spring]], and [[Porter, Texas|Porter]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A system of toll roads, operated by the [[Harris County Toll Road Authority]] (HCTRA) and [[Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority]] (FBCTRA), provides additional options for regional commuters. The Sam Houston Tollway, which encompasses the mainlanes of Beltway 8 (as opposed to the [[frontage road]]s, which are untolled), is the longest tollway in the system, covering the entirety of the Beltway with the exception of a free section between Interstate 45 and Interstate 69 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The region is serviced by four spoke tollways: a set of [[managed lane]]s on the Katy Freeway; the [[Hardy Toll Road]], which parallels Interstate 45 north of Downtown up to [[Spring, Texas|Spring]]; the [[Westpark Tollway]], which services Houston's western suburbs out to [[Fulshear, Texas|Fulshear]]; and [[Fort Bend Parkway]], which connects to [[Sienna Plantation, Texas|Sienna Plantation]]. Westpark Tollway and Fort Bend Parkway are operated conjunctly with the Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority.

Greater Houston's freeway system is monitored by Houston TranStar, a partnership of four government agencies which is responsible for providing transportation and [[emergency management]] services to the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstontranstar.org/about_transtar/ About Houston TranStar]. ''Houston TranStar.'' 2008. Retrieved on February 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greater Houston's [[arterial road]] network is established at the municipal level, with the City of Houston exercising planning control over both its [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] area and [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] (ETJ). Therefore, Houston exercises transportation planning authority over a {{Convert|2000|mi2|km2|adj=on}} area over five counties, many times larger than its corporate area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/transportation/docs_pdfs/2015_PolicyStatement.pdf|title=Major Thoroughfare and Freeway Plan Policy Statement|last=|first=|date=March 2015|website=City of Houston|access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Major Thoroughfare and Freeway Plan'', updated annually, establishes the city's [[street hierarchy]], identifies roadways in need of widening, and proposes new roadways in unserved areas. Arterial roads are organized into four categories, in decreasing order of intensity: ''major thoroughfares'', ''transit corridor streets'', ''collector streets'', and ''local streets''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Roadway classification affects anticipated traffic volumes, roadway design, and [[right of way]] breadth. Ultimately, the system is designed to ferry traffic from neighborhood streets to major thoroughfares, which connect into the limited-access highway system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Notable arterial roads in the region include [[Westheimer Road]], [[Memorial Drive (Houston)|Memorial Drive]], [[Texas State Highway 6]], [[Farm to Market Road 1960]], [[Bellaire Boulevard]], and [[Telephone Road]].

===Transit===

[[File:METRO Light Rail3.jpg|thumb|right|[[METRORail]] light rail]]
The [[Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County]] (METRO) provides [[public transport]]ation in the form of buses, [[light rail]], [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes]], and [[paratransit]] to fifteen municipalities throughout the Greater Houston area and parts of unincorporated Harris County. METRO's service area covers {{Convert|1303|mi2|km2}} containing a population of 3.6 million.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.h-gac.com/taq/regionally-coordinated-transportation-plan/documents/Appendix-D-Transportation-Resource-Inventory.pdf|title=Gulf Coast Regionally Coordinated Transportation Plan – 2016 Transportation Resource Inventory Update|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Houston–Galveston Area Council|page=62|access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

METRO's local bus network services approximately 275,000 riders daily with a fleet of over 1,200 buses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The agency's 75 local routes contain nearly 8,900 stops and saw nearly 67 million boardings during the 2016 fiscal year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A [[park and ride]] system provides commuter bus service from 34 transit centers scattered throughout the region's suburban areas; these express buses operate independently of the local bus network and utilize the region's extensive system of HOV lanes.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.h-gac.com/taq/plan/2040/docs/2040-RTP-revised-April-2016.pdf|title=2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)|last=|first=|date=March 2016|website=Houston–Galveston Area Council|access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown and the Texas Medical Center have the highest rates of transit use in the region, largely due to the park and ride system, with nearly 60% of commuters in each district utilizing public transit to get to work.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

METRO began light rail service in 2004 with the opening of the {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} north-south [[METRORail Red Line|Red Line]] connecting Downtown, Midtown, the Museum District, the Texas Medical Center, and [[NRG Park]]. In the early 2010s, two additional lines—the [[METRORail Green Line|Green Line]], servicing the [[East End, Houston|East End]], and the [[METRORail Purple Line|Purple Line]], servicing the [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]]—opened, and the Red Line was extended northward to [[Northline, Houston|Northline]], bringing the total length of the system to {{Convert|22.7|mi|km}}. Two light rail lines outlined in a five-line system approved by voters in a 2003 referendum have yet to be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Vote-against-Metro-referendum-could-mean-more-rail-3923747.php|title=Vote against Metro referendum could mean more rail|last=Smalley|first=George F.|date=October 5, 2012|work=Houston Chronicle|access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[METRORail Uptown Line|Uptown Line]], which would run along Post Oak Boulevard in [[Uptown Houston|Uptown]], is currently under construction as a [[bus rapid transit]] line—the city's first—while the [[METRORail University Line|University Line]] has been postponed indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/University-Line-federal-funding-pledge-pulled-7846885.php|title=Federal funding pulled for light rail line construction along Richmond Avenue|last=Begley|first=Dug|date=May 24, 2016|work=Houston Chronicle|access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The light rail system saw approximately 16.8 million boardings in fiscal year 2016.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[Houston Airport System]], a branch of the municipal government, oversees the operation of three major public airports in the city. Two of these airports, [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] and [[William P.

'''Jan Andries Blokker, Sr.''' (27 May 1927 – 6 July 2010) was a Dutch journalist, columnist, [[publicist]], writer,&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Jan Blokker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/82155/Jan-Blokker}}&lt;/ref&gt; and amateur historian. In The Netherlands, Blokker was best known for his columns in ''[[De Volkskrant]]'', which he wrote between 1968 and 2006.

==Biography==
Blokker, born in the [[Admiralenbuurt]] in Amsterdam, grew up in a secular liberal family.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} His father was office clerk. At the age of seven, he and his father weekly visited the Cineac theatre for the [[Polygoon (newsreel)|Polygoon newsreel]].

Blokker went to the [[Hogere burgerschool|HBS]] on the [[Keizersgracht]]. In 1944, after getting his [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]-[[Geisteswissenschaft|alpha]] diploma, he went on to study ''[[Culture of the Netherlands|Neerlandistiek]]'' and history. He never completed them.

In 1950, Blokker made his debut as a novelist with the [[novelle]] ''Séjour'', for which he won the [[Reina Prinsen Geerligs Award]]. Two more novels followed, ''Bij dag en ontij'' (1952) and ''Parijs, dode stad'' (1954). In 1952, Blokker became student reporter for the Dutch newspaper ''[[Het Parool]]''. After a while, [[Simon Carmiggelt]] asked him to write film reviews. In 1954 he became film critic at ''[[Algemeen Handelsblad]]''. At the art section of the news paper, he met important Dutch writers like [[Henk Hofland]] and [[Harry Mulisch]].

Blokker was also a screenwriter, who wrote the scripts for films like ''[[Fanfare (film)|Fanfare]]'' by [[Bert Haanstra]] (1958) and ''[[Makkers Staakt uw Wild Geraas]]'' by [[Fons Rademakers]] (1960) and ''[[Monsieur Hawarden]]'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Monsieur Hawarden|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/141076/Monsieur-Hawarden/credits}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also one of the people behind the satirical [[VARA (broadcaster)|VARA]] TV-program ''Zo is het toevallig ook nog eens een keer'' (1963–1964). At another broadcasting organisation, [[VPRO]], he became editor in chief. He was partly responsible for the revolutionary course that organisation took. He also provided VPRO's documentaries with commentary.

From 1968 on, he worked for ''[[De Volkskrant]]'' as a columnist. In the 1960s and 1970s, he was seen as the voice of the intellectual left, specialized in satirical pieces about politics, current affairs and whatever was fashionable with the left-wing readers of the newspaper. Between 1978 and 1983, he was adjunct editor in chief at the newspaper. He wrote the column until 2006, when a conflict forced him to leave the newspaper. He continued his column for ''[[nrc.next]]''.

'''''Jaunde-Texte von Karl Atangana und Paul Messi''''' is a book written by [[Charles Atangana|Karl Atangana]] and [[Paul Messi]] and edited by linguist [[Martin Heppe]]. Atangana compiled the book while living in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], from 1911 to 1913. It consists of his letters and of the [[folklore]] and [[oral history]] he had learned as a young [[Beti-Pahuin|Ewondo]] boy in Africa prior to the establishment of the [[German Empire|German]] [[Kamerun]] colony. It was published in Hamburg in 1919. Today, the ''Jaunde-Texte'' is an important source on the early history of the Ewondo and related peoples.

The ''Jaunde-Texte'' also provides insight into Atangana's beliefs and character. He wrote of his hosts, "To dare to approach the Germans it is necessary to abandon the traits which displease them, to become their friend and then be valued by them."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Quinn 488.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurultai''' ([[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]:{{MongolUnicode|ᠻᠦᠷᠦᠯᠳᠠᠶ}}, Хуралдай, ''Khuruldai''; [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Kurultay''),&lt;ref group=dn&gt;[[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]: Құрылтай, ''Qurıltay''; {{lang-tt|Корылтай}}, {{lang|tt-latn|Qorıltay}}; {{lang-ba|Ҡоролтай}}, {{lang|ba-latn|Qoroltay}}; {{lang-az|Qurultay}}; {{lang-tk|Gurultaý}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a political and military council of ancient [[Mongols|Mongol]] and some [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] chiefs and [[Khan (title)|khans]]. The root of the word is "Khur" (assemble/discuss) and that helps form "Khural" meaning political "meeting" or "assembly" in [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] languages. ''Khuraldai'' (written Khuruldai) or Khuraldaan means "a gathering", or more literally, "intergatheration". This root is the same in the Mongolian word ''khurim'', which means "feast" and "wedding" and originally referred to large festive gatherings on the steppe, but is used mainly in the sense of wedding in modern times.

==Mongol Empire==
All Great Khans of the [[Mongol Empire]], for example [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Ogedei Khan]], were formally elected in a ''Kurultai''; khans of subordinate Mongol states, such as the [[Golden Horde]], were elected by a similar regional Kurultai.

During the Kurultai, Mongol Chiefs would all convene in order to choose the next Great Khan. The Kurultai, oftentimes but not always held in the capital of the Mongolian empire, were also a time to assign all critical positions of leadership as well as an opportunity to decide the militaristic direction to be implemented under new Khan and the aforementioned new leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898313910|title=Dynastic China : an elementary history|last=1944-|first=Tan, Koon San,|isbn=9839541889|location=Kuala Lumpur|oclc=898313910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the new khan has been elected, an elaborate enthronement procedure followed. [[Johann Schiltberger]], a 15th-century German traveler, described the installation of a new Golden Horde khan as follows(,&lt;ref name="Schiltberger"&gt;Commander J. Buchan Telfer, "The Bondage and Travels of Johann Schiltberger". (London, [[Hakluyt Society]], 1879{{Page needed|date=June 2011}})&lt;/ref&gt;
quoted in &lt;ref name="Vernadsky"&gt;[[George Vernadsky]], "The Mongols and Russia". (Yale University Press, 1953){{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;):
{{cquote|
When they choose a king, they take him and seat him on white [[felt]], and raise him in it three times. Then they lift him up and carry him round the tent, and seat him on a throne, and put a golden sword in his hand. Then he must be sworn as is the custom.}}

Russian princes and [[boyar]]s, who often had to wait in [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]] for the Kurultai to elect a new khan, who would then re-issue their [[yarlyk]]s (patents), would no doubt often witness this ''khan kutermiak'' rituals, which became increasingly more frequent and futile during the mid-14th century time of troubles in the [[Golden Horde|Horde]], giving rise to the Russian word "кутерьма" (''kuter'ma''), meaning "running around pointlessly".&lt;ref name="Vernadsky"/&gt;

Kurultai were imperial and tribal assemblies convened to determine, strategize and analyze military campaigns and assign individuals to leadership positions and titles. One such example is [[Genghis Khan]] was declared [[Khan (title)|Khan]] in the 1206 kurultai. Most of the major military campaigns were first planned out at assemblies such as this and there were minor and less significant Kurultais under the Mongol Empire under political subordinate leaders and generals.

The kurultai, however, required the presence of the senior members of the tribes participating, who were also in charge militarily. Thus, the deaths of [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]] and [[Möngke Khan|Möngke]] in 1241 and 1259, respectively, necessitated the withdrawal of Mongol leaders (and troops) from the outskirts of [[Vienna]] and [[Venice]] (in 1241) and from [[Syria]] (in 1259), hamstringing military operations against the Austrians and [[Mamluk]]s that might otherwise have continued.

Although the Kurultai was a serious political event in the Mongol world, it was also a festival of sorts including great feasting and various traditional games. Many of these traditions have been carried on in the modern day Mongolian event, the [[Naadam]], which includes [[Mongolian wrestling]], horse racing, and archery competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/276930428|title=Empire of the Mongols|last=Michael.|first=Burgan,|date=2009|publisher=Chelsea House|isbn=9781604131635|edition=Rev.|location=New York|oclc=276930428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
Various modern [[Mongolian peoples|Mongolian]] and [[Turkic peoples]] use it in the political or administrative sense, as a synonym for [[parliament]], [[congress]], [[Meeting|conference]], [[Local Government|council]], [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]], [[Convention (meeting)|convention]], gathering. Examples are: [[The World Qoroltai of the Bashkirs|World Qoroltai of the Bashkirs]], Fourth Qurultay of [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Supreme Council (Kyrgyzstan)|National Kurultai of Kyrgyzstan]], the [[State Great Khural|State Great Khural of Mongolia]], [[People's Khural of the Republic of Buryatia|People's Khural of Buryatian]] and Kurultai held today in Hungary, there written [[Great Kurultáj|Kurultáj]].

In Mongolian, the following forms of the word are still in use today: khuraldai, khuraldaan and khural. "Ulsin Deed Shuukhiin Khuraldaan" means "session of the National Supreme Court".

Also spelled as: kurultay, qurultay, qurıltai, qorıltay, and qoroltay.

The word has several modern usages in the modern [[Turkish language]] as well: "Yüksek Öğretim Kurulu"(Higher Education Counsel), "genel kurul toplantısı" (general board meeting), ". "Kurultay" is also a highly used word in modern Turkish meaning general assembly, such as that of organisations, committees etc. "Kurul" is also a verb in Turkish meaning to be established.

'''Lucius Cincius Alimentus''' was a celebrated Roman [[annalists|annalist]] and [[jurist]], who was [[praetor]] in Sicily in 209 BC, with the command of two [[Roman legion|legions]].&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Graves | first = John Thomas | authorlink = | title = Alimentus, L.

Wiseman]], ''Clio's Cosmetics'' (Bristol Phoenix Press, 2003, originally published 1979 by Leicester University Press), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Cincian Law, which forbade the acceptance of pay for legal services, takes its name from his proposal of the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant, Caesar and Christ (1944). Simon &amp; Schuster. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his works is an account of his imprisonment in the [[Second Punic War]], and a biography of the philosopher [[Gorgias]], though these works probably formed part of his ''Annals''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' xxi. 38&lt;/ref&gt; His objectivity was praised by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] and [[Polybius]], and he was frequently cited by the [[Festus (historian)|historian Festus]].&lt;ref name="latlit"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Conte  | first = Gian Biagio  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Latin Literature  | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]  | year = 1999  | location = Baltimore  | pages = 69–70  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NJGp_dkXnuUC  | isbn = 0-8018-6253-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cincius Alimentus was captured in one of the early battles of the Second Punic War and spent years as a prisoner of the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] under [[Hannibal]], who, for some reason, confided in Alimentus the details of his crossing of the [[Alps]].  He transcribed this tale after his release, and the information found its way into the chronicles of many later Roman historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Prevas  | first = John  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Hannibal Crosses the Alps  | publisher = [[Da Capo Press]]  | year = 2001  | location =   | pages = 71–72  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh6nsB94veIC  | isbn = 0-306-81070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinguished  historian of Rome [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] praised  Alimentus, early in the 19th century, as a critical investigator of antiquity, who threw light on the history of his country by researches among its ancient monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], i. p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Alimentus has a far less triumphal account of the early relations between the Romans and the early Latins than most historians. One of the fragments of Alimentus which survives, dates the founding of Rome as 729/728 BC (the 4th year of the 12th [[Olympiad]]); Niebuhr accounted for the difference by supposing that both Alimentus and the other annalists found a record dating the foundation 132 [[Roman calendar|ten-month years]] before the reign of [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus|Tarquin the Elder]], who changed the calendar; Niebuhr supposed that Alimentus converted this to 110 twelve-month years before calculating the [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]].

Among the works attributed to Alimentus are a treatise ''De Officio Jurisconsulti'', containing at least two books; one book ''De Verbis priscis''; one ''De Consulum Potestate'', one ''De Comitiis'', one ''De Fastis'', two, at least, ''Mystagogicon'', and several ''De Re Militari''.  In the latter work he handles the subjects of military levies, of the ceremonies of declaring war, and generally of the ''[[Fetial|Jus Fetiale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'' xvi. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Voss., ''Hist.

'''Massive Retaliation''', also known as  a '''massive response''' or '''massive deterrence''', is a [[military doctrine]] and [[nuclear strategy]] in which a state commits itself to retaliate in much greater force in the event of an attack.

==Strategy==
{{main|Assured destruction}}
In the event of an attack from an aggressor, a state would massively retaliate by using a force disproportionate to the size of the attack.

The aim of massive retaliation is to [[Deterrence theory|deter]] another state from initially attacking. For such a strategy to work, it must be made public knowledge to all possible aggressors. The aggressor also must believe that the state announcing the policy has the ability to maintain [[second-strike capability]] in the event of an attack. It must also believe that the defending state is willing to go through with the deterrent threat, which would likely involve the use of [[nuclear weapon]]s on a massive scale.

Massive retaliation works on the same principles as [[mutual assured destruction]] (MAD), with the important caveat that even a minor conventional attack on a nuclear state could conceivably result in all-out nuclear retaliation. However at the time when massive retaliation became policy, there was no MAD, because the Soviet Union lacked a [[second strike]] capability throughout the 1950s.

==History==
In August 1945, [[Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Impact on surrender|towards the end]] of the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] of [[World War II]], the [[United States]] delivered [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear attacks]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] in Japan. Four years later, on August 9, 1949, the [[Soviet Union]] developed its own nuclear weapons. At the time, both sides lacked the means to effectively use nuclear devices against each other. Eventually with [[nuclear triad]]s being established, both countries were quickly increasing their ability to deliver [[nuclear weapons]] into the interior of the opposing country.

The term "massive retaliation" was coined by [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]] in a speech on January 12, 1954.

Dulles stated:

{{Quote|We need allies and [[collective security]]. Our purpose is to make these relations more effective, less costly. This can be done by placing more reliance on deterrent power and less dependence on local defensive power... Local defense will always be important. But there is no local defense which alone will contain the mighty landpower of the Communist world. Local defenses must be reinforced by the further deterrent of massive retaliatory power. A potential aggressor must know that he cannot always prescribe battle conditions that suit him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/article-dulles-retaliation_1962-01-25.htm |title=The Evolution of Foreign Policy |accessdate=4 September 2008 |author=John Foster Dulles |authorlink=John Foster Dulles |date=12 January 1954 |publisher=Department of State, Press Release No. 81 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514020511/http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/article-dulles-retaliation_1962-01-25.htm |archivedate=2008-05-14 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dulles also said that the U.S. would respond to military provocation "at places and with means of our own choosing." This speech and quotes appear to form the basis for the term massive retaliation, which would back up any conventional defense against conventional attacks with a possible massive retaliatory attack involving nuclear weapons.

The doctrine of massive retaliation was based on the West's increasing fear at the perceived [[Balance of power in international relations|imbalance of power]] in conventional forces, a corresponding inability to defend itself or prevail in conventional conflicts. By relying on a large nuclear arsenal for deterrence, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] believed that conventional forces could be reduced while still maintaining military prestige and power and the capability to defend the western bloc.

An additional motivation for the adoption of mass retaliation was President Eisenhower's conviction that a strong national economy (which he believed was reliant on low taxation) was essential for a well funded national defense.  A shift to relying on nuclear weapons for deterrence would allow the United States to keep abreast of the Soviet Union's military strength.  In 1953, one tonne of TNT cost $1700 to produce while fissionable material of similar explosive power cost a mere $23 to manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World that came in from the Cold|last=Patros|first=Gabriel|publisher=Royal Institute of International Affairs|year=1993|isbn=|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon a conventional attack on Berlin, for instance, the United States would undertake a massive retaliation on the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons. The massive response doctrine was thus an extension of mutually assured destruction to conventional attacks, conceivably deterring the Soviet Union from attacking any part of the United States' sphere of influence even with conventional weapons.

==Criticism==
Two members of the [[RAND Corporation]] criticized the doctrine as too aggressive and identical to the first strike. [[Herman Kahn]] stressed that many military planners adhering to the "splendid first strike" believed that if the Soviets did provoke the U.S. then they should launch a large strike at "a time and place of our choosing." This is "the massive retaliation theory as enunciated by … Dulles."&lt;ref&gt;''On Thermonuclear War'', (Princeton &amp; New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1960), p 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]] noted that Dulles' doctrine "reflected a characteristically military dissatisfaction, one made familiar previously in the MacArthur hearings." It represented nothing new about the defense of America or Europe but it was startling because it seemed to reject restraint symbolized by Korea for areas of not vital interests. In the event of a similar Korean incident, the Dulles's doctrine implied much more than bombing the North Korean armies with thermonuclear weapons. We seem to be resolved to launch "a full-fledged strategic nuclear bombing attack on China!" And "we should probably have to include the Soviet Union as well."&lt;ref&gt;''Strategy in the Missile Age'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1959), p 251, 254-255.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dulles's doctrine, Brodie concludes, "of course, is a preventive war, save that we have waited for an excuse, a provocation," and hence of time not entirely of our choosing.&lt;ref&gt;''Strategy in the Missile Age'', p 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

In theory, as the U.S.S.R. had no desire to provoke an all-out nuclear attack, the policy of massive response likely deterred any ambitions it would have had on Western Europe. Although the United States and [[NATO]] bloc would be hard-pressed in a conventional conflict with the [[Warsaw Pact]] forces if a conventional war were to occur, the massive response doctrine prevented the Soviets from advancing for fear that a nuclear attack would have been made upon the Soviet Union in response to a conventional attack.

It can be argued{{by whom|date=October 2016}}, however, that aside from raising tensions in an already strained relationship with the [[Soviet bloc]], massive retaliation had few practical effects at that time. Before the development of the US [[nuclear triad]], the threat of massive retaliation was hard to make credible, and was inflexible in response to foreign policy issues, as everyday challenges of foreign policy could not have been dealt with using a massive nuclear strike. In fact, the Soviet Union took many minor military actions that would have necessitated the use of nuclear weapons under a strict reading of the massive retaliation doctrine.

A massive retaliation doctrine, as with any nuclear strategy based on the principle of [[mutually assured destruction]] and as an extension the [[second-strike capability]] needed to form a retaliatory attack, encouraged the opponent to perform a massive [[counterforce]] [[first strike]]. This, if successful, would cripple the defending state's retaliatory capacity and render a massive retaliation strategy useless. Subsequent developments such as [[thermonuclear warhead]] miniaturization, accurate silo-based [[ICBM]]s, accurate [[SLBM|submarine-launched ballistic missiles]], [[stealth aircraft|stealth]] technology applied to [[cruise missiles]], and [[GPS|GPS munitions guidance]] have resulted in a much more credible second-strike capability for some technologically advanced nations.

Still, if both sides of a conflict adopt the same stance of massive response, it may result in unlimited [[Conflict escalation|escalation]] (a "nuclear spasm"), each believing that the other will back down after the first round of retaliation. Both problems are not unique to massive retaliation, but to nuclear deterrence as a whole.

==Policy shift==
{{main|Second strike|Mutual assured destruction}}
In 1957, three years after his announcement of massive retaliation, Dulles compromised his doctrine. In recent years, he wrote in ''Foreign Affaris'', there has been no alternative to massive retaliation. But now the response can be confined to limited targets.&lt;ref&gt;"Challenge and Response in US Foreign Policy," ''Foreign Affairs'', 36/1, (October 1957): p 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of the Cold War, [[Marc Trachtenberg]], finds that since the very announcement, Dulles was moving toward the flexible response.&lt;ref&gt;''A Constructed Peace: The Making of the European Settlement, 1945-1963'', (Princeton &amp; New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1999), p 185-186.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Eisenhower until the end of his term continued to dismiss out of hand the very idea of restraint in general war. In 1959, he said: "Once we become involved in a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union, we could not stop until we had finished off the enemy." There was no point to talking about "negotiating a settlement in the midst of the war," no alternative, therefore, to hitting "the Russians as hard as we could."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in ''A Constructed Peace'', p 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[John F. Kennedy]] abandoned the policy of massive retaliation during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in favor of [[flexible response]]. The Soviet nuclear MRBMs in Cuba had very short flight time to their US targets and could have crippled the SAC bomber bases before the aircraft could take off and launch massive retaliation against the [[Soviet Union]]. Under the Kennedy Administration, the [[United States]] adopted a more flexible policy in an attempt to avert nuclear war if the Soviets did not cooperate with American demands. If the United States' only announced military reaction to any Soviet incursion (no matter how small) was a massive nuclear strike, and the U.S. didn't follow through, then the Soviets would assume that the United States would never attack. This would have made the Soviet Union far more bold in its military ventures against U.S. allies and would probably have resulted in a full-scale [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].{{According to whom|date=March 2016}} [[Thomas Shelling|Thomas Schelling]]'s deterrence theory discusses this more sharply: "signalling", or the use of threats internationally to deter an enemy from an attack or to make demands. If signals weren't being properly addressed by the Soviet Union, if the threats were not intimidating or coercing them to remove the missiles from Cuba, then the Soviet Union would simply not have believed that the U.S.'s policy of massive retaliation held any water. By having other, more flexible policies to deal with aggressive Soviet actions, the U.S. could opt out of a nuclear strike and take less damaging actions to rectify the problem without [[Face (social concept)|losing face]] in the international community.

Another reason for this was the development of a Soviet [[second strike]] capability, in the form of silo-based ICBMs and later SLBMs.

Mesrop Mashtots was born in a noble family ("from the house of an ''[[azat]]''" according to [[Anania Shirakatsi]]) in the settlement of Hatsekats in [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]]&lt;ref name="koryun"&gt;[[Koryun]] [http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/korun/english/index.html ''The Life of Mashtots''], translation into Russian and intro by Sh.V.Smbghaatyan and K.A.Melik-Oghajanyan, Moscow, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; (identified as the village of Hac'ik in the Mush plain),&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Thierry, "Notes de géographie historique sur le Vaspurakan", REByz 1976 vol34.&lt;/ref&gt; and died in [[Vagharshapat, Armenia|Vagharshapat]]. He was the son of a man named Vardan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghazar Parpetsi]], ''History of Armenia'', 5th to 6th century&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koryun]], his pupil and biographer, tells us that Mashtots (in his work he does not mention the name Mesrop) received a good education, and was versed in the [[Medieval Greek|Greek]] and [[Middle Persian|Persian]] languages.&lt;ref name="koryun" /&gt; On account of his piety and learning Mesrop was appointed secretary to King [[Khosrov IV of Armenia|Khosrov IV]]. His duty was to write in Greek and Persian characters the decrees and edicts of the sovereign.

Leaving the court for the service of God, he took [[holy orders]], and withdrew to a monastery with a few chosen companions. There, says Koryun, he practiced great austerities, enduring hunger and thirst, cold and poverty. He lived on vegetables, wore a hair shirt, slept upon the ground, and often spent whole nights in prayer and the study of the [[Bible|Holy Scriptures]]. This life he continued for a few years.

Armenia, so long the [[Roman-Persian Wars|battle-ground of Romans and Persians]], lost its independence in 387, and was divided between the Byzantine Empire and Persia, about four-fifths being given to the latter. Western Armenia was governed by Byzantine generals, while an Armenian king ruled, but only as feudatory, over Persian Armenia. The Church was naturally influenced by these violent political changes, although the loss of civil independence and the partition of the land could not destroy its organization or subdue its spirit. Persecution only quickened it into greater activity, and had the effect of bringing the clergy, the nobles, and the common people closer together. The principal events of this period are the invention of the [[Armenian alphabet]], the revision of the liturgy, the creation of an ecclesiastical and national literature, and the readjustment of hierarchical relations. Three men are prominently associated with this work: Mesrop, [[Isaac of Armenia|Patriarch Isaac]], and King [[Vramshapuh]], who succeeded his brother Khosrov IV in 389. In 394, with the help of blessing of Armenia's Catholicos, [[Sahak Partev]], Mesrop set out on a mission of spreading the word of God to a [[Paganism|pagan]] or semi-pagan people.

Mesrop, as noted, had spent some time in a monastery preparing for a missionary life. With the support of Prince [[Shampith]], he preached the [[Gospel]] in the district of [[Goghtn]] near the river [[Araxes]], converting many heretics and pagans. However, he experienced great difficulty in instructing the people, for the Armenians had no alphabet of their own, instead using [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] scripts, none of which were well suited for representing the many complex sounds of their native tongue. Again, the Holy Scriptures and the liturgy, being written in Syriac, were, to a large extent, unintelligible to the faithful. Hence the constant need of translators and interpreters to explain the Word of God to the people.

Mesrop, desirous to remedy this state of things, resolved to invent a national alphabet, in which undertaking Isaac and King Vramshapuh promised to assist him. It is hard to determine exactly what part Mesrop had in the fixing of the new alphabet. According to his Armenian biographers, he consulted Daniel, a bishop of [[Mesopotamia]], and Rufinus, a monk of [[Samosata]], on the matter. With their help and that of Isaac and the king, he was able to give a definite form to the alphabet, which he probably adapted from the Greek. Others, like [[François Lenormant|Lenormant]], think it derived from the [[Avestan]]. Mesrop's alphabet consisted of thirty-six letters; two more (long O and F) were added in the twelfth century.

Medieval Armenian sources also claim that Mashtots invented the [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]] and [[Caucasian Albanian alphabet|Caucasian Albanian]] alphabets around the same time. However, most scholars link the creation of the Georgian script to the process of [[Christianization of Iberia]], a core Georgian kingdom of [[Kartli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=B. G.

The first sentence in Armenian written down by St. Mesrop after he invented the letters is said to be the opening line of Solomon’s [[Book of Proverbs]]:
{{Cquote|{{lang|hy|[[wikt:ճանաչել զիմաստութիւն եւ զխրատ, իմանալ զբանս հանճարոյ|Ճանաչել զիմաստութիւն եւ զխրատ, իմանալ զբանս հանճարոյ]]:}}&lt;br /&gt;''Čanačʿel zimastutʿiwn ew zxrat, imanal zbans hančaroy.''&lt;br /&gt;«To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding.»|||''[[Book of Proverbs]]'', 1:2.}}

[[Image:Amaras-vank.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Amaras Monastery]] in [[Artsakh (historic province)|Artsakh]], where Mesrop Mashtots established the first-ever Armenian school that used his script in the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Viviano, Frank. “The Rebirth of Armenia,” National Geographic Magazine, March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The invention of the alphabet in 405 was the beginning of [[Armenian literature]], and proved a powerful factor in the upbuilding of the national spirit. "The result of the work of Isaac and Mesrop", says St. Martin,&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Histoire du Bas-Empire de Lebeau}}, V, 320.&lt;/ref&gt; "was to separate for ever the Armenians from the other peoples of the East, to make of them a distinct nation, and to strengthen them in the Christian Faith by forbidding or rendering profane all the foreign alphabetic scripts which were employed for transcribing the books of the heathens and of the followers of [[Zoroaster]]. To Mesrop we owe the preservation of the language and literature of Armenia; but for his work, the people would have been absorbed by the Persians and Syrians, and would have disappeared like so many nations of the East".

Anxious that others should profit by his discovery, and encouraged by the patriarch and the king, Mesrop founded numerous schools in different parts of the country, in which the youth were taught the new alphabet. It is historically proven, that Saint Mesrop himself taught in Amaras monastery of Artskah region of Armenia (located in contemporary Martuni region of unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic). But his activity was not confined to Eastern Armenia. Provided with letters from Isaac he went to [[Constantinople]] and obtained from the Emperor [[Theodosius the Younger]] permission to preach and teach in his Armenian possessions. Having returned to Eastern Armenia to report on his missions to the patriarch, his first thought was to provide a religious literature for his countrymen. Having gathered around him numerous disciples, he sent some to [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], Constantinople, [[Athens]], [[Antioch]], [[Alexandria]], and other centres of learning, to study the Greek language and bring back the masterpieces of Greek literature. The most famous of his pupils were [[John of Egheghiatz]], [[Joseph of Baghin]], [[Yeznik]], Koryun, [[Moses of Chorene]], and [[John Mandakuni]].

[[Image:Dzeragir.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Verses of Mesrop Mashtots]]

The first monument of this Armenian literature is the version of the Holy Scriptures. Isaac, says Moses of Chorene, made a translation of the Bible from the Syriac text about 411. This work must have been considered imperfect, for soon afterwards John of Egheghiatz and Joseph of Baghin were sent to Edessa to translate the Scriptures. They journeyed as far as Constantinople, and brought back with them authentic copies of the Greek text. With the help of other copies obtained from Alexandria the Bible was translated again from the Greek according to the text of the [[Septuagint]] and [[Origen]]'s ''[[Hexapla]]''. This version, now in use in the Armenian Church, was completed about 434.

[[File:Mesrop Mashtots' grave stone.jpg|thumb|Gravesite of Mesrop Mashtots. The inventor of the Armenian alphabet.]]

The decrees of the first three councils — [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicæa]], [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]], and [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] — and the national liturgy (so far written in Syriac) were also translated into Armenian, the latter being revised on the liturgy of [[St. Basil]], though retaining characteristics of its own. Many works of the Greek Fathers also passed into Armenian. The loss of the Greek originals has given some of these versions a special importance; thus, the second part of [[Eusebius]]'s ''Chronicle,'' of which only a few fragments exist in the Greek, has been preserved entirely in Armenian. In the midst of his literary labors Mesrop revisited the districts he had evangelized in his earlier years, and, after the death of Isaac in 440, looked after the spiritual administration of the patriarchate. He survived his friend and master by only six months. The [[Armenians]] read his name in the Canon of the Liturgy, and celebrate his memory on 19 February.

Saint Mashtots is buried at a chapel in [[Oshakan]], a historical village {{convert|8|km|abbr=in}} southwest from the town of [[Ashtarak]].

Saint Mesrop is listed officially in the ''[[Roman Martyrology]]'' of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; his feast day is February 17.

==Legacy==
[[File:2014 Erywań, Matenadaran (16).jpg|250px|thumb|The statue of Mesrop Mashtots in front of [[Matenadaran]], Yerevan]]
Virtually every town in Armenia has a street named after Mashtots.  In [[Yerevan]], Mashtots Street is one of the most important in the city center, which was previously known as Lenin Street (Lenin Prospect).  There is a statue to him at the [[Matenadaran]], one at the church he was buried at in Oshakan village, and one at the monument to the alphabet found on the skirts of Mt. Aragats north of Ohanavan Village.  Stamps have been issued with his image by both the Soviet Union and by post-Soviet Armenia.

The [[Order of St. Mesrop Mashtots]], established in 1993, is awarded for significant achievements in economic development of the Republic of Armenia or for accomplishments, such as in science, culture, education or public service, and for activities promoting those fields.

==Music==
Mashtots also produced a number of liturgical compositions. Some of the works attributed to him are: «Մեղայ քեզ Տէր» (''Meġay k’ez Tēr'', “Miserere to you, Lord”), «Ողորմեա ինձ Աստուած» (''Voġormea inj Astuac'', “Have mercy of me, God”), «Անկանիմ առաջի քո» (''Ankanim aṙaǰi k’o'', “I kneel before you”) and «Ողորմեա» (''Voġormea'', “Miserere”), all of which are hymns of [[Repentance (Christianity)|repentance]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

[[File:La naumaquia-Ulpiano Checa.JPG|thumb|right|320px|Naumachia (detail): an imaginative recreation by [[Ulpiano Checa]], first exhibited in 1894.]]
The  '''naumachia''' (in [[Latin]] ''naumachia'', from the [[Ancient Greek]] ναυμαχία/''naumachía'', literally "naval combat") in the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] world referred to both the staging of [[naval warfare|naval battles]] as mass entertainment, and the basin or building in which this took place.

== Early ''naumachiae'' ==
The first known ''naumachia'' was given by [[Julius Caesar]] in Rome in 46 BC on occasion of his quadruple [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. After having a basin dug near the [[Tiber]], capable of holding actual [[bireme]]s, [[trireme]]s and [[quinquereme]]s, he made 2000 combatants and 4000 rowers, all prisoners of war, fight. In 2 BC on the occasion of the inauguration of the [[Forum of Augustus|Temple of Mars Ultor]] ("[[Mars (mythology)#Mars Ultor|Mars the Avenger]]"), Augustus gave a naumachia based on Caesar's model. As cited in Res Gestæ (§ 23), he created a basin on the right bank of the Tiber where 3000 men, not counting rowers, fought in 30 vessels with rams and a number of smaller boats.

[[Claudius]] gave a ''naumachia'' in 52 AD on a natural body of water, [[Fucine Lake]], to celebrate the completion of drainage work and tunneling on the site. The combatants were prisoners who had been condemned to death. Suetonius' account, written many years after the event, has them salute the emperor with the phrase ''"[[Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant|morituri te salutant]]"'' ("those who are about to die salute you"). There is no evidence that this form of address was used on any occasion other than this single naumachia.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase is attested in  Suetonius, ''Lives'', Claudius, 21, 1214 &amp; a century later, by Cassius Dio, 60, 33, 3‑4, who referred to the same event and probably used Suetonius or a now lost common source. Suetonius gives Claudius' reply as "aut non" ("or not"), which the naumachiarii misinterpret as a general pardon, much to the fury of the emperor. See Leon, HJ, ''Morituri Te Salutamus'', Transactions of the American Philological Association, 1939, 70, 46-47: available online at Bill Thayer's website [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/TAPA/70/Morituri_Te_Salutamus*.html] (accessed 1 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The naumachia was thus a bloodier show than gladiatorial combat, which consisted of smaller engagements and where the combat did not necessarily end with the death of the losers. More exactly, the appearance of naumachia is closely tied and only slightly earlier than that other spectacle, "group combat", which did not pit single combatants against one another, but rather used two small armies. There again, the combatants were frequently those on death row and did not have the specialized training of true [[gladiator|gladiators]]. Caesar, creator of the naumachia, simply had to transpose the same principle to another environment.

Through the choreography of the combat, the naumachia had the ability to represent historical or pseudo-historical themes. Each of the fleets participating represented a maritime power of [[Ancient Greece]] or the [[Hellenistic]] east: [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrians]] for Caesar’s naumachia, [[Persian Empire|Persians]] and [[Athenian Empire|Athenians]] for that of Augustus, [[History of Sicily|Sicilians]] and [[Rhodes|Rhodeans]] for that of Claudius. It required significantly greater resources than other such entertainments, and as such these spectacles were reserved for exceptional occasions, closely tied to celebrations of the emperor, his victories and his monuments. The specific nature of the spectacle as well as the historical themes borrowed from the Greek world are closely tied to the term naumachia. This word, a phonetic transcription of the Greek word for a naval battle (ναυμαχία / naumakhía), has since come to also refer to the large artificial basins created for them.

==''Naumachia'' building==
Caesar’s naumachia was probably a simple basin dug into the low-lying ground on the northern or southern banks of the Tiber, and fed by its waters; the exact location is unknown; most likely [[Trastavere]] or the [[Campus Martius]].&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, K. M., "Launching into History: Aquatic Displays in the Early Empire", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 83 (1993), p. 50; Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, DOI: 10.2307/300978 {{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naumachia of Augustus is better known: in his [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestæ (23)]] Augustus himself indicates that the basin measured 1800 x 1200 Roman feet (approximately 533 x 355 meters). [[Pliny the Elder]] (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 16, 200), describes an island formed in the center, probably rectangular and connected to the shore by a bridge where the privileged spectators likely sat.

Taking into consideration the size of the basin and the dimensions of a trireme (approximately 35 x 4.90 meters), the thirty vessels used would hardly be able to manoeuvre. Knowing that the crew of a Roman trireme was approximately 170 rowers and 50 to 60 soldiers, a simple calculation allows us to see that to achieve the number of 3000 men the vessels of Augustus' fleet would have to have held more combatants than an actual fleet. The spectacle thus focused less on the movement of the vessels than the actual presence of them in the artificial basin, and the hand-to-hand combat which developed.

It was different for Claudius' naumachia. The two fleets each consisted of 50 vessels, which corresponds to the number of vessels in each of the two military fleets based at [[Misenum]] and at [[Ravenna]]. Lake Fucino was large enough that only part of it was needed, surrounded by pontoons, and there was room enough for the vessels to manoeuvre and ram each other. The naumachia of Claudius therefore truly reproduced naval combat.

According to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]] in ''[[De aquaeductu]]'' (''De aquis urbis Romæ'', 11, 1-2 : opus naumachiæ), the water supply for the naumachia of Augustus was specially constructed, with the surplus used to water neighbouring gardens in the Trans Tiberim. This was the [[Aqua Alsietina]] [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]], remains of which have been found on the slopes of [[Janiculum]] (the "8th hill of Rome") below the monastery of [[San Cosimato]]. There are several theories as to the precise location of the site; the latest of which places it between [[Via Aurelia]] in the north and the church of [[San Francesco a Ripa]] in the southeast, in the loop of the Tiber. The republican viaduct discovered in the Via Aurelia near [[San Crisogono]] may also have served as a conduit for the basin. 

The basin did not last very long. During the reign of Augustus it was partly replaced (Suetonius, ''Augustus'', 43, 1)  by the ''nemus Cæsarum'' (sacred forest of the Caesars), later renamed "forest of Gaius and Lucius" for the grandsons of Augustus (Dion Cassius, 66, 25, 3). This vast area was probably built upon by the end of the 1st century.

==''Naumachiae'' in amphitheatres==
[[File:Naumachia2.gif|thumb|Old engraving.]]
A new development occurred during the reign of [[Nero]]: a naumachia in an [[amphitheatre]]. Suetonius (''Nero'', XII, 1) and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]] (''Roman History'', LXI, 9, 5) speak of such a spectacle in 57 AD in a wooden amphitheatre inaugurated by the last of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Nothing is known of the site other than that it was built on the [[Campus Martius]]. Nero presented another ''naumachia'' in 64 AD. This was preceded by hunts and followed by gladiatorial combat and a great banquet (Dio Cassius, LXII, 15, 1). It is unknown what form these games took. It was probably the same wooden amphitheatre, given that there is no mention of its destruction before the [[great fire of Rome]] which happened shortly afterwards. 

For the inauguration of the [[Colosseum]] in 80 AD, [[Titus]] gave two ''naumachiae'', one in the Augustinian basin, again using several thousand men, and the other in the new amphitheatre (Dion Cassius, LXVI, 25, 1-4). According to Suetonius (''Domitian'', IV, 6-7), [[Domitian]] organised a ''naumachia'' inside the Colosseum, undoubtedly circa 85 AD, and another one in the year 89 AD in a new basin dug beyond the Tiber; with the stone removed serving to repair the [[Circus Maximus]], which had burnt on two sides. It was probably in the time between these two ''naumachia'' that Domitian completed the network of rooms underneath the Colosseum that are visible today, at the same time precluding such spectacles in the arena. 

The arena at the Colosseum only measured 79.35 x 47.20 meters, far removed from the dimensions of the Augustinian basin. A ''naumachia'' in the Colosseum could therefore not have been as grand as the previous ones. One can imagine a confrontation between the crews of several reproductions of warships, potentially life-size or reasonably close to it, but actual maneuvers or even floating seems doubtful. It is known that stage-props were used to represent ships, sometimes with mechanisms to simulate shipwrecks, both on stage and in the arena ([[Tacitus]], ''Annales'', XIV, 6, 1 ; Dion Cassius LXI, 12,2).

==Water in the amphitheatres==
The use of enough water to float vessels in amphitheatres raises technical questions. Amphitheatres were not exclusively used for ''naumachiae''; they would have been filled and drained rapidly enough for use in gladiatorial combats and other spectacles. The rapid transition between water shows and earth-based shows seems to have been one of the great attractions. Dion Cassius underscores this as it relates to Nero's ''naumachia'' (LXI, 9, 5); [[Martial]] does as well speaking of Titus' ''naumachia'' in the Colosseum (''Book of Spectacles'', XXIV). The only surviving written sources offer no descriptions of the mechanisms or engineering involved. Archaeology provides no clues: the basement of the Colosseum has since been modified. Only two provincial amphitheatres, those at [[Verona]] and [[Amphitheatre of Mérida|Mérida, Spain]], provide any technical evidence.

The central pit of the Verona amphitheatre was deeper than the rooms normally found underneath the arena, and served as a basin. It was connected to two axial conduits. One, circulating under the West gallery of the arena, was not connected to the drainage system and had to be connected to an [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] in order to fill the basin. The East conduit was deeper and designed to drain water into the [[Adige River]]. The basin at the Mérida amphitheatre, at only 1.5 meters, was shallower than that at Verona. Because it is so shallow—less than the height of a standing man—it cannot be confused with an underground service room. This basin was equipped with access stairs and covered with material similar to that used for swimming pools and [[Roman baths]]. It was also served by two conduits, the western one of which connected to the nearby San Lazaro aqueduct.

The dimensions of these basins rule out any but the most basic of ''naumachiae'': the one at Mérida measures a mere 18.5 x 3.7 meters. Only the most modest of water spectacles could have taken place here. This leads one to conclude that, even assuming that the Colosseum had a similar basin before construction of the ''[[hypogeum]]'' (underground complex), ''naumachiae'' would have been performed on only a shallow layer of water covering the surface of the arena, the minimum required to float the ships.

== Decline of Roman ''naumachia'' ==
The introduction of new technologies initially led to an increased number of ''naumachia''. The first three ''naumachia'' were spaced about 50 years apart; the following six, most of which took place in amphitheatres, occurred in a space of 30 years. Less costly in material and human terms, they could afford to be staged more frequently. Less grandiose, they became a feature of the games, but could not be considered exceptional.  The [[iconography]] bears witness to this. Of some twenty representations of a ''naumachia'' in [[Roman art]], nearly all are of the [[Pompeian Styles#Fourth Style|Fourth Style]], of the time of [[Nero]] and the [[Flavian dynasty]].

After the Flavian period, ''naumachiae'' disappear from the texts almost completely.  Apart from a mention in the ''[[Augustan History]]'', a late source of limited reliability, only the town records (''fastia'') of [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]] tells us that in 109 [[Trajan]] inaugurated a ''naumachia'' basin. This site was discovered in the 18th century on the grounds of the  [[Vatican City]], behind the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].  Subsequent digs have revealed the complete site plan.  It had [[bleacher]]s (tiered stands for spectators) and the surface was about one sixth the size of the Augustan ''naumachia''.  In the absence of any texts, it has to be assumed that it was only used at the time of Trajan.

Nevertheless, if late Roman Empire sources and persistence into the [[Middle Ages]] in terms of the [[toponymy]] of ''naumachia'' and ''dalmachia'' at the site are taken into consideration, it still existed into the 5th century.  Moreover, the presence of bleachers on its perimeter is a strong indicator of regular shows. According to the Ostia municipal records, the inauguration involved 127 pairs of gladiators; leading one to believe that as in the amphitheatre, the restrictive space at Trajan's basin was not conducive to large combats involving many untrained prisoners, or would have required over-simplification of naval combats, leading to a preference for single combat.  In this form, and with a dedicated site, ''naumachiae'' could easily have continued (though likely at a reducing frequency) for several centuries without mention in sources, as they would not have been particularly worthy of mention: they simply lost their grandeur and impressive character.

In the provinces, the influence of Roman ''naumachiae'' is easily discernible, but limited and reduced to local and innocuous naval games and re-enactments. A competition which went under the name of ''naumaciva'' was part of the [[Panathenaic Games]] between the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Ephebos]] from the Flavian period onward. It replaced the [[regatta]]s which had taken place at these games earlier.  If [[Ausonius]] is to be believed, (Moselle, 200-2,29), a ''naumachia'' was held on the [[Moselle River]] between local youth.

== Post-Roman ''naumachiae'' ==
[[File:Milan Naumanchia, 1807.jpeg|thumb|right|A modern naumachia held in the Civic Arena of Milan in 1807]]
A ''naumachia'' was performed for [[Henry II of France]] in [[Rouen]] in 1550. Another was held in [[Milan]] for [[Napoleon]] in 1807.

[[Parc Monceau]] in [[Paris]] features a ''naumachia'' water feature, surrounded by a colonnade. In 18th and 19th century England, several parks featured mock naval battles with model ships, which were also referred to as ''naumachia''. [[Peasholm Park]] in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], England, still stages such an event. Smaller, theatre-based [[aqua drama]]s were also popular.

'''Paul Karl Feyerabend''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|aɪər|ˌ|æ|b|ən|d}}; {{IPA-de|ˈfaɪɐˌʔaːbn̩t, -ˌʔaːbm̩t|lang}}; January 13, 1924 – February 11, 1994) was an [[Austria]]n-born [[philosopher of science]] best known for his work as a professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he worked for three decades (1958–1989). At various different points in his life, he lived in England, the United States, [[New Zealand]], [[Italy]], Germany, and finally [[Switzerland]]. His major works include ''[[Against Method]]'' (published in 1975), ''[[Science in a Free Society]]'' (published in 1978) and ''[[Farewell to Reason]]'' (a collection of papers published in 1987). Feyerabend became famous for his purportedly [[epistemological anarchism|anarchistic view of science]] and his rejection of the existence of universal methodological rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Horgan | last=J. | date=1993 | title=Profile: Paul Karl Feyerabend – The Worst Enemy of Science | journal=[[Scientific American]] | volume=268 | issue=5 | pages=36–37 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0593-36| bibcode=1993SciAm.268e..36H }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an influential figure in the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]]. Asteroid (22356) Feyerabend is named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=22356 | title=(22356) Feyerabend = 1992 WS6 | publisher=International Astronomy Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early Life===
Feyerabend was born in 1924 in [[Vienna]], where he attended primary and high school. In this period he got into the habit of frequent reading, developed an interest in theatre, and started singing lessons. After graduating from high school in April 1942 he was drafted into the German [[Arbeitsdienst]]. After basic training in [[Pirmasens]], Germany, he was assigned to a unit in Quelern en Bas, near [[Brest, France|Brest]] (France). Feyerabend described the work he did during that period as monotonous: "we moved around in the countryside, dug ditches, and filled them up again." After a short leave he joined the army and volunteered for officer school. In his [[autobiography]] he writes that he hoped the war would be over by the time he had finished his education as an officer. This turned out not to be the case. From December 1943 on, he served as an officer on the northern part of the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]], was decorated with an [[Iron cross]], and attained the rank of [[lieutenant]]. When the German army started its retreat from the advancing [[Red Army]], Feyerabend was hit by three bullets while directing traffic. One bullet hit him in the spine. As a consequence he needed to walk with a stick for the rest of his life and frequently experienced severe pain. He spent the rest of the war recovering from his wounds.

===Post–WWII and university===
When the war was over, Feyerabend first got a temporary job in [[Apolda]] where he wrote plays. He was influenced by the Marxist playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]] and was invited by Brecht to be his assistant at the East [[Berlin State Opera]] but turned down the offer. Feyerabend took various classes at the [[Weimar Academy]], and returned to [[Vienna]] to study [[history]] and [[sociology]]. He became dissatisfied, however, and soon transferred to [[physics]], where he met [[Felix Ehrenhaft]], a physicist whose experiments would influence his later views on the nature of science. Feyerabend changed his course of studies to [[philosophy]] and submitted his final thesis on observation sentences. In his autobiography, he described his philosophical views during this time as "staunchly empiricist". In 1948 he visited the first Alpbach Forum&lt;ref&gt;[[European Forum Alpbach]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2016}} in [[Alpbach]]. There Feyerabend first met [[Karl Popper]], who had a "positive" (early Popper), as well as "negative" (later Popper) effect on him. In 1949 he was a founding member of the [[Kraft Circle]]. In 1951, Feyerabend was granted a [[British Council]] scholarship to study under [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]. However, Wittgenstein died before Feyerabend moved to England. Feyerabend then chose Popper as his supervisor instead, and went to study at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1952. In his autobiography, Feyerabend explains that during this time, he was influenced by Popper: "I had fallen for [Popper's ideas]". After that, Feyerabend returned to Vienna and was involved in various projects; a translation of Karl Popper's ''Open Society and its Enemies'', hunting down manuscripts Popper had left in Vienna, a report on the development of the humanities in [[Austria]], and several articles for an encyclopedia.

===Academia===
[[File:Paul Feyerabend 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Feyerabend later in life. Photograph by Grazia Borrini-Feyerabend]]
In 1955, Feyerabend received his first academic appointment at the [[University of Bristol]], where he gave lectures about the [[philosophy of science]]. Later in his life he worked as a professor (or equivalent) at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[University of Auckland|Auckland]], [[University of Kassel|Kassel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swr.de/-/id=12651310/property=download/nid=660374/1968oq/swr2-wissen-20140211.pdf |title=Paul Feyerabend und die Demokratisierung des Wissens |last= |first= |date=Feb 11, 2014 |website=SWR2-Wissen |publisher=SWR2 |access-date=June 6, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[University of Sussex|Sussex]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[University of London|London]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[ETH Zurich]]. During this time, he developed a critical view of science, which he later described as '[[anarchy|anarchistic]]' or '[[dada]]istic' to illustrate his rejection of the dogmatic use of rules, a position incompatible with the contemporary rationalistic culture in the philosophy of science. At the [[London School of Economics]], Feyerabend met a colleague of K. R. Popper, [[Imre Lakatos]] with whom he planned to write a dialogue volume in which Lakatos would defend a rationalist view of science and Feyerabend would attack it. This planned joint publication was put to an end by Lakatos's sudden death in 1974. ''Against Method'' became a famous criticism of current philosophical views of science and provoked many reactions.  In his autobiography, he reveals that the energy in his writings came at great cost to himself:

{{quote|The depression stayed with me for over a year; it was like an animal, a well-defined, spatially localizable thing. I would wake up, open my eyes, listen – Is it here or isn't? No sign of it. Perhaps it's asleep. Perhaps it will leave me alone today. Carefully, very carefully, I get out of bed. All is quiet. I go to the kitchen, start breakfast. Not a sound. TV – ''Good Morning America'' –, David What's-his-name, a guy I can't stand. I eat and watch the guests. Slowly the food fills my stomach and gives me strength. Now a quick excursion to the bathroom, and out for my morning walk – and here she is, my faithful depression: "Did you think you could leave without me?"|From his autobiography, ''[[Killing Time (Paul Feyerabend book)|Killing Time]]''}}

Feyerabend moved to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in [[California]] in 1958 and became a U.S. citizen. Following (visiting) professorships (or their equivalent) at [[University College London]], [[Berlin]], and [[Yale University|Yale]], he taught at the [[University of Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] in 1972 and 1974, always returning to [[California]]. He later enjoyed alternating between posts at [[ETH Zurich]] and Berkeley through the 1980s but left Berkeley for good in October 1989, first to [[Italy]], then finally to Zurich. After his retirement in 1991, Feyerabend continued to publish frequent papers and worked on his autobiography. After a short period of suffering from a [[brain tumor]], he died in 1994 at the Genolier Clinic, overlooking Lake Geneva, Switzerland.

==Thought==

===Philosophy of science===
{{Original research|date=May 2008}}

====Nature of scientific method====
{{main article|Epistemological anarchism}}
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
In his books ''Against Method'' and ''Science in a Free Society'' Feyerabend defended the idea that there are no [[methodology|methodological]] rules which are always used by scientists. He objected to any single prescriptive [[scientific method]] on the grounds that any such method would limit the activities of scientists, and hence restrict [[scientific progress]]. In his view, science would benefit most from a "dose" of theoretical [[anarchism]]. He also thought that theoretical anarchism was desirable because it was more ''humanitarian'' than other systems of organization, by not imposing rigid rules on scientists.

{{quote|For is it not possible that science as we know it today, or a "search for the truth" in the style of traditional philosophy, will create a monster? Is it not possible that an [[objective approach]] that frowns upon personal connections between the entities examined will harm people, turn them into miserable, unfriendly, self-righteous mechanisms without charm or humour? "Is it not possible," asks [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], "that my activity as an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [or critico-rational] observer of nature will weaken my strength as a human being?" I suspect the answer to many of these questions is affirmative and I believe that a reform of the sciences that makes them more anarchic and more subjective (in [[Kierkegaard]]'s sense) is urgently needed. {{cite book |title=Against Method |page=154}}}}

Feyerabend's position was originally seen as radical in the philosophy of science, because it implies that philosophy can neither succeed in providing a general description of science, nor in devising a method for differentiating products of science from non-scientific entities like myths. (Feyerabend's position also implies that philosophical guidelines should be ignored by scientists, if they are to aim for progress.)

To support his position that methodological rules generally do not contribute to scientific success, Feyerabend provides counterexamples to the claim that (good) science operates according to a certain fixed method. He took some examples of episodes in science that are generally regarded as indisputable instances of progress (e.g. the [[Copernican revolution]]), and showed that all common prescriptive rules of science are violated in such circumstances. Moreover, he claimed that applying such rules in these historical situations would actually have prevented scientific revolution.

One of the criteria for evaluating scientific theories that Feyerabend attacks is the ''consistency criterion''. He points out that to insist that new theories be consistent with old theories gives an unreasonable advantage to the older theory. He makes the logical point that being compatible with a defunct older theory does not increase the validity or truth of a new theory over an alternative covering the same content. That is, if one had to choose between two theories of equal explanatory power, to choose the one that is compatible with an older, falsified theory is to make an [[aesthetic]], rather than a rational choice. The familiarity of such a theory might also make it more appealing to scientists, since they will not have to disregard as many cherished prejudices. Hence, that theory can be said to have "an unfair advantage".

Feyerabend was also critical of [[falsificationism]]. He argued that no interesting theory is ever consistent with ''all'' the relevant facts. This would rule out using a naïve falsificationist rule which says that scientific theories should be rejected if they do not agree with known facts. Feyerabend uses several examples, but "[[renormalization]]" in [[quantum mechanics]] provides an example of his intentionally provocative style: "This procedure consists in crossing out the results of certain calculations and replacing them by a description of what is actually observed. Thus one admits, implicitly, that the theory is in trouble while formulating it in a manner suggesting that a new principle has been discovered" {{cite book |title=Against Method |page=61}} Feyerabend is not advocating that scientists do not make use of renormalization or other ad hoc methods. Instead, he is arguing that such methods are essential to the progress of science for several reasons. One of these reasons is that progress in science is uneven. For instance, in the time of [[Galileo]], optical theory could not account for phenomena that were observed by means of telescopes. So, astronomers who used telescopic observation had to use ad hoc rules until they could justify their assumptions by means of optical theory.

Feyerabend was critical of any guideline that aimed to judge the quality of scientific theories by comparing them to known facts. He thought that previous theory might influence natural interpretations of observed phenomena. Scientists necessarily make implicit assumptions when comparing scientific theories to facts that they observe. Such assumptions need to be changed in order to make the new theory compatible with observations. The main example of the influence of natural interpretations that Feyerabend provided was the ''tower argument''. The tower argument was one of the main objections against the theory of a moving earth. Aristotelians assumed that the fact that a stone which is dropped from a tower lands directly beneath it shows that the earth is stationary. They thought that, if the earth moved while the stone was falling, the stone would have been "left behind". Objects would fall diagonally instead of vertically. Since this does not happen, Aristotelians thought that it was evident that the earth did not move. If one uses ancient theories of impulse and relative motion, the Copernican theory indeed appears to be falsified by the fact that objects fall vertically on earth. This observation required a new interpretation to make it compatible with Copernican theory. Galileo was able to make such a change about the nature of impulse and relative motion. Before such theories were articulated, Galileo had to make use of ad hoc methods and proceed counterinductively. So, "ad hoc" hypotheses actually have a positive function: they temporarily make a new theory compatible with facts until the theory to be defended can be supported by other theories.

Feyerabend commented on the [[Galileo affair]] as follows:
{{quote|The church at the time of Galileo was much more faithful to reason than Galileo himself, and also took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's doctrine. Its verdict against Galileo was rational and just, and revisionism can be legitimized solely for motives of political opportunism.&lt;ref&gt;Ratzinger [[#Reference-Ratzinger-1994|(1994, p.98)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7188860.stm|title=Papal visit scuppered by scholars|date=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ncregister.com/site/article/7917 | title=The Death of Irony: Benedict and the Enemies of Reason | date=2008-01-29 | work=National Catholic Register | publisher=EWTN News | first=Angelo | last=Matera | access-date=2008-02-15 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203183726/http://ncregister.com/site/article/7917/ | archive-date=2008-02-03 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Together these remarks sanction the introduction of theories that are inconsistent with well-established facts. Furthermore, a pluralistic methodology that involves making comparisons between any theories at all forces defendants to improve the articulation of each theory. In this way, scientific [[Scientific pluralism|pluralism]] improves the critical power of science. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] cited Feyerabend to this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1177/0021140008098846 | title=Understanding Feyerabend on Galileo| journal=Irish Theological Quarterly| volume=74| pages=89| year=2009| last1=Hickey| first1=T. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Feyerabend, new theories came to be accepted not because of their accord with [[scientific method]], but because their supporters made use of any trick – rational, rhetorical or ribald – in order to advance their cause. Without a fixed ideology, or the introduction of religious tendencies, the only approach which does not inhibit progress (using whichever definition one sees fit) is "anything goes": "'anything goes' is not a 'principle' I hold... but the terrified exclamation of a rationalist who takes a closer look at history." (Feyerabend, 1975).

Feyerabend considered the possibility of [[commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]], but he was hesitant in his application of the concept. He wrote that "it is hardly ever possible to give an explicit definition of [incommensurability]" {{cite book |title=Against Method |page=225}}, because it involves covert classifications and major conceptual changes. He also was critical of attempts to capture incommensurability in a logical framework, since he thought of incommensurability as a phenomenon outside the domain of logic. In the second appendix of ''Against Method'' (p.&amp;nbsp;114), Feyerabend states, "I never said... that ''any two'' rival theories are incommensurable... What I ''did'' say was that ''certain'' rival theories, so-called 'universal' theories, or 'non-instantial' theories, ''if interpreted in a certain way'', could not be compared easily." Incommensurability did not concern Feyerabend greatly, because he believed that even when theories ''are'' commensurable (i.e. can be compared), the outcome of the comparison should not necessarily rule out either theory. To rephrase: when theories are incommensurable, they cannot rule each other out, and when theories are commensurable, they cannot rule each other out. Assessments of (in)commensurability, therefore, don't have much effect in Feyerabend's system, and can be more or less passed over in silence.

In ''Against Method'' Feyerabend claimed that [[Imre Lakatos]]'s philosophy of research programmes is actually "anarchism in disguise", because it does not issue orders to scientists. Feyerabend playfully dedicated ''Against Method'' to "Imre Lakatos: Friend, and fellow-anarchist". One interpretation is that Lakatos's philosophy of mathematics and science was based on creative transformations of Hegelian historiographic ideas, many associated with Lakatos's teacher in Hungary [[Georg Lukács]]. Feyerabend's debate with Lakatos on scientific method recapitulates the debate of Lukács and (Feyerabend's would-be mentor) Brecht, over aesthetics several decades earlier.

While Feyerabend described himself as an "epistemological anarchist", he explicitly disavowed being a "political [[Anarchism|anarchist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Feyerabend | title=Science in a Free Society | publisher=New Left Books | location=London | date=1978 | oclc=4653967 | isbn=0860910083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anarchist-leaning critics of science have agreed with this distinction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Martin | first=B. | title=Anarchist science policy | journal=The Raven: Anarchist Quarterly | volume=7 | pages=136–153 | date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Restivo | first=S. | title=Science, sociology of science, and the anarchist tradition | journal=The Raven: Anarchist Quarterly | volume=7 | pages=183–196 | date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have argued that [[Anarchism|political anarchism]] is tacitly embedded in Feyerabend's philosophy of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Thorpe | first1=C. | last2=Welsh | first2=I. |  title=Beyond primitivism: Towards a twenty-first century anarchist theory and praxis for science and technology | journal=Anarchist Studies | volume=16 | issue=1 | pages=48–75 | date=Spring 2008 | url=http://www.anarkismo.net/article/9648 | isbn=9781905007776 | publisher=Lawrence &amp; Wishart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The decline of the physicist-philosopher====
Feyerabend was critical of the lack of knowledge of philosophy shown by the generation of physicists that emerged after World War II:&lt;blockquote&gt;The withdrawal of philosophy into a "professional" shell of its own has had disastrous consequences. The younger generation of physicists, the [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]s, the [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]]s, etc., may be very bright; they may be more intelligent than their predecessors, than [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]], [[Ernst Mach|Mach]] and so on. But they are uncivilized savages, they lack in philosophical depth – and this is the fault of the very same idea of professionalism which you are now defending.&lt;ref&gt;''For and Against Method''. The comments appeared in a 1969 letter to Feyerabend's Berkeley philosophy chair Wallace Matson, which is reproduced in Appendix B of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Feyerabend was himself heavily criticized for his misrepresentation of the practices, methods and goals of some of the above-mentioned scientists, esp. Mach and Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Hentschel (1985) for a point-by-point-refutation of one of Feyeraband's provocative papers on these two scientist-philosophers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of science in society===
Feyerabend described science as being essentially anarchistic, obsessed with its own mythology, and as making claims to truth well beyond its actual capacity. He was especially indignant about the condescending attitudes of many scientists towards alternative traditions. For example, he thought that negative opinions about [[astrology]] and the effectivity of rain dances were not justified by scientific research, and dismissed the predominantly negative attitudes of scientists towards such phenomena as elitist or racist. In his opinion, science has become a repressing ideology, even though it arguably started as a liberating movement. Feyerabend thought that a pluralistic society should be protected from being influenced too much by science, just as it is protected from other ideologies.

Starting from the argument that a historical universal scientific method does not exist, Feyerabend argues that science does not deserve its privileged status in western society. Since scientific points of view do not arise from using a universal method which guarantees high quality conclusions, he thought that there is no justification for valuing scientific claims over claims by other ideologies like religions. Feyerabend also argued that scientific accomplishments such as the moon landings are no compelling reason to give science a special status. In his opinion, it is not fair to use scientific assumptions about which problems are worth solving in order to judge the merit of other ideologies. Additionally, success by scientists has traditionally involved non-scientific elements, such as inspiration from mythical or religious sources.

Based on these arguments, Feyerabend defended the idea that science should be separated from the state in the same way that [[separation of church and state|religion and state are separated in a modern secular society]] ({{cite book |title=Against Method |edition=3rd |page=160}}). He envisioned a "free society" in which "all traditions have equal rights and equal access to the centres of power" ({{cite book |title=Science in a Free Society |page=9}}). For example, parents should be able to determine the ideological context of their children's education, instead of having limited options because of scientific standards. According to Feyerabend, science should also be subjected to democratic control: not only should the subjects that are investigated by scientists be determined by popular election, scientific assumptions and conclusions should also be supervised by committees of lay people.{{Citation needed|reason=This seems like a misinterpretation; please cite for verification.|date=November 2008}} He thought that citizens should use their own principles when making decisions about these matters. He rejected the view that science is especially "rational" on the grounds that there is no single common "rational" ingredient that unites all the sciences but excludes other modes of thought ({{cite book |title=Against Method |edition=3rd |page=246}}).

===Philosophy of mind===
{{details|topic=mind-body problem|eliminative materialism}}
Along with a number of mid-20th century philosophers (most notably, [[Wilfrid Sellars]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], and [[Richard Rorty]]), Feyerabend was influential in the development of [[eliminative materialism]], a radical position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that holds that our ordinary, common-sense understanding of the mind (what materialist monists call "[[folk psychology]]") is false. It is succinctly described by a modern proponent, [[Paul Churchland]], as follows:
: "Eliminative materialism is the thesis that our commonsense conception of psychological phenomena constitutes a radically false theory, a theory so fundamentally defective that both the principles and the [[ontology]] of that theory will eventually be displaced, rather than smoothly reduced, by completed neuroscience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Churchland | first=Paul M. | date=January 1990 | title=A neurocomputational perspective: the nature of mind and the structure of science | location=Cambridge, MA | publisher=The MIT Press | isbn=9780262031516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In three short papers published in the early sixties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Feyerabend | first=Paul K. | date=1962 | title=Explanation, reduction, and empiricism | series=Minnesota studies in the philosophy of science | work=Scientific Explanation, Space &amp; Time | editor-first1=H. | editor-last1=Feigl | editor-first2=G. | editor-last2=Maxwell | location=Minneapolis | volume=3 | pages=28–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=20123984 | last=Feyerabend | first=Paul | date=1963a | title=Materialism and the mind-body problem | journal=Review of Metaphysics | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=49–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Feyerabend | first=Paul K | date=1963b | title=Comment: Mental events and the brain | journal=The Journal of Philosophy | volume=LX | issue=11 | jstor=2023030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend sought to defend [[materialism]] against the supposition that the mind cannot be a physical thing. Feyerabend suggested that our commonsense understanding of the mind was incommensurable with the (materialistic) scientific view, but that nevertheless we ought to prefer the materialistic one on general methodological grounds.

This view of the mind/body problem is widely considered one of Feyerabend's most important legacies. Even though Feyerabend himself seems to have given it up in the late 1970s, it was taken up by [[Richard Rorty]] and, more recently, by [[Patricia Churchland]] and [[Paul Churchland]]. In fact, as Keeley observes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Brian L. | last=Keeley | editor-first=Brian L. | editor-last=Keeley | date=2006 | title=Paul Churchland | chapter=Introduction: Becoming Paul Churchland | publisher=Cambridge University Press | pages=1–31 | isbn=978-0-521-83011-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "PMC [Paul Churchland] has spent much of his career carrying the Feyerabend mantle forward" (p.&amp;nbsp;13).

===Other works===
Some of Feyerabend's work concerns the way in which people's perception of reality is influenced by various rules. In his last book, unfinished when he died, he talks of how our sense of reality is shaped and limited. ''Conquest of Abundance: A Tale of Abstraction versus the Richness of Being'' bemoans the propensity we have of institutionalizing these limitations.

The last philosophy book that Feyerabend finished is ''The Tyranny of Science'' (written 1993, published May 13, 2011). In it Feyerabend challenges what he sees in his view as some modern myths about science, e.g., he believes that the statement 'science is successful' is a myth. He argues that some very basic assumptions about science are simply false and that substantial parts of scientific ideology were created on the basis of superficial generalizations that led to absurd misconceptions about the nature of human life. He claims that far from solving the pressing problems of our age, scientific theorizing glorifies ephemeral generalities at the cost of confronting the real particulars that make life meaningful.

===Popular influence===
The book ''[[On the Warrior's Path]]'' quotes Feyerabend, highlighting the similarities between his epistemology and [[Bruce Lee]]'s worldview.&lt;ref name="Warriors Path"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolelli|first=Daniele | authorlink=Daniele_Bolelli | title=On the warrior's path: philosophy, fighting, and martial arts mythology|date=2008|publisher=Blue Snake|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=978-1583942192|edition=2nd | pages=153–184, esp. 171–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 retrospective on [[Thomas Kuhn | Thomas Kuhn's]] theory of paradigm shifts in social science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Paradigm Shift: How Expert Opinions Keep Changing on Life, the Universe and Everything | publisher=Imprint Academic | date=1 September 2015 | pages=181–2 | isbn=1845407946}}&lt;/ref&gt; the philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] cites several of Feyerabend's sceptical positions on conventional claims at scientific knowledge and agrees with Feyerabend that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what this notion of paradigm shifts' might mean, and that Kuhn essentially retreated from the more radical implications of his theory, which were that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive. Cohen says that although in their lifetimes, Kuhn and Feyerabend made up two viciously opposed sects, they agreed that science consists of long periods of settled agreement (so-called 'normal science') punctuated by radical, conceptual upheaval (so-called paradigm shifts).

'''Refeudalization''' is the process of recovering mechanisms and relationships that used to define [[feudalism]]. Because the term "feudalism" is slightly ambiguous, "refeudalization" is ambiguous, too.

In the modern era, the term "refeudalization" is used for policies that give special privileges to organized groups such as [[NGO]]s.

== Refeudalization in seventeenth-century European historiography ==
The process of '''refeudalization''' is also used in seventeenth-century European historiography. The term was made famous by Italian Marxist historians [[Ruggiero Romano]] and [[Rosario Villari]], to illuminate the social conditions behind the Neapolitan Revolt of 1647. The concept was influenced by Gramsci's ideas, the historigraphical debates during the 1950s and 1960s that centered on Eric Hobsbawm's seventeenth century "[[General Crisis]]" as well as 1960s Italian politics. Villari used it quite specifically in reference to the increasing pressure in the six decades preceding the revolt of 1647, in which the peasantry and the lower-middle classes revolted against the feudal aristocracy and international financiers. The process was triggered by the royal state's need for money. The Spanish crown ennobled the bourgeoisie of rich merchants and financiers, who infiltrated and reinforced the noble order. [[Fernand Braudel]] found the “clearest case of refeudalization” in Spanish Naples. The monarchy had raised capital by selling feudal titles, which in the  long term increased the fiscal burden that the seigneurial regime imposed on the rural poor, since the nobles were exempted from paying taxes to the viceroyal regime. Refeudalization in a more general sense has been used to explain Italy's failed transition to modern capitalism. Though Italy had pioneered the commercial revolution, feudal barons neglected business opportunities to innovate and further rationalize the processes of production.

== Refeudalization in Habermas's theory of the public sphere ==
[[Jürgen Habermas]]’s theory of the [[public sphere]] is based on his research into the bourgeois class of the eighteenth century in Great Britain, France and Germany; his key work on the theme is ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'' (1962). Habermas saw space that had been gained for the public around the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries returning to private hands, a process which he called 'the refeudalization [''Refeudalisierung''] of the public spehere': 'Habermas discussed the pincer-like movement in which late modern [[consumer capitalism]] attempts to turn us into unthinking mass consumers on one hand, while political actors, interest groups, and the state try to turn us into unthinking mass citizens on the other'.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jamie Warner, 'The New Refeudalization of the Public Sphere', in ''The Routledge Companion to Advertising and Promotional Culture'', edited by Matthew P. McAllister and Emily West (New York: Routledge, 2013), pp. 285-97 (p. 285).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habermas's idea of the 'public sphere' ===
For Habermas, the 'public sphere' is 'a space in which all citizens can critically, substantively, and rationally debate public policy' (though this does not necessarily exist in any single physical space: it can also be constituted, for example, by newspapers).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In its ideal form, the public sphere is "made up of private people gathered together as a public and articulating the needs of society with the state".
The public sphere is the source of public opinion needed to "legitimate authority in functioning democracy". Habermas made a distinction between ''[[lifeworld]]'' and ''system''. The public sphere is part of the lifeworld and it is the immediate setting of the individual social actor, and Habermas opposed any analysis which uncoupled the interdependence of the lifeworld.&lt;ref name="Habermas, 1990 p 292"&gt;Habermas, ''Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit'', Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1962 (1990), p 292. ("The Structural Change of The Public Sphere"), translation Walter Kastorp (expressly for Wikipedia)&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas's analysis is based on an oral bias; he believed that the public sphere can be most effectively constituted and maintained through dialogue, acts of speech, debate and discussion. In his further reflections, Habermas claims that public debate can be animated by “opinion-forming associations” which are voluntary associations, social organizations such as from churches, sports clubs, groups of concerned citizens, grassroots movements, trade unions – to counter or refashion the messages of authority.
This public sphere began to form first in Britain at the end of the seventeenth century. It resulted in the Licensing Act (1695), which allowed newspapers to print what they want without the Queen’s censorship. However, there were still strict laws. But the sphere is seen as a crucial enabler for this to happen.&lt;ref name="Habermas, 1990 p 292"/&gt;

=== The refeudalization of the public sphere ===
For Habermas, a key feature of the feudal is that small numbers of individuals embodied the public state: a king or similar officer ''was'' the realm (what Habermas called 'representative publicity'). Habermas saw the eighteenth-century bourgeois public sphere as a positive contrast to this situation. But in the twentieth century, he perceived the rise of advertising, marketing and 'public relations' trying to manipulate the public and discourage critical thought, and he perceived the state, political parties, and interest groups increasingly using the same approaches to win votes. This is 'refeudalization' because 'the public sphere becomes the court &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;before&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; whose public prestige can be displayed─rather than &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;in&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; which public critical debate is carried on'.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, ''The Transformation of the Public Sphere'', p. 201, quoted by Jamie Warner, 'The New Refeudalization of the Public Sphere', in ''The Routledge Companion to Advertising and Promotional Culture'', edited by Matthew P. McAllister and Emily West (New York: Routledge, 2013), pp. 285-97 (p. 287).&lt;/ref&gt;

"Publicity once meant the exposure of political domination before public reasoning; ''publicity'' [here Habermas uses the English word] sums up the reactions of a non-binding goodwill. The bourgeois public sphere readopts feudal qualities in proportion to its formation by ''public relations'' [in English]: the "offering agents" display representative expenditure in front of compliant customers. Publicity imitates that aura of personal prestige and preternatural authority which the representative public sphere had once imparted.

A "refeudalization" of the public sphere must be discussed in another, more exact sense. The integration of mass entertainment and advertising, which in the form of public relations already assumes a "political" character, subjugates namely even the state under its code. Because private companies suggest to their customers in consumer decisions the consciousness of citizens, the state has to "appeal to" its citizens like consumers. Thus the public use of violence also solicits publicity.

== Refeudalization in sociology of neoliberal globalization ==
There is a third context which sociologists, drawing on Habermas, refer to contemporary socio-economic processes in the global economy as refeudalization. The concepts overlap with discussions of [[neomedievalism]]. The Swiss sociologist [[Jean Ziegler]] uses the German expression "Refeudalisierung der Gesellschaft" to illuminate the forces behind [[neoliberal]] [[globalization]]. In his pamphlet "[[The Empire of Shame]]", he criticizes the new system of "Refeudalisierung" based on [[scarcity]] and debt. However, the concept in English is typically translated as the "new feudalization", which here means the subversion of Enlightenment values (freedom, equality and brotherhood) and the radical [[privatization]] of [[public goods]] and services.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Ziegler, ''L'empire de la honte'' (Fayard, 2005), {{ISBN|978-2213623993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Schutte, '[https://archiv.attacberlin.de/ags/argumente/text-refeudalisierung/ Was ist: »Refeudalisierung der Gesellschaft"?]', ''attacBerlin'' (26.2.2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable ideas have been developed by Sighard Neckel.&lt;ref&gt;Sighard Neckel, '[http://www.mpifg.de/pu/workpap/wp10-6.pdf Refeudalisierung der Ökonomie: Zum Strukturwandel kapitalistischer Wirtschaft]', MPIfG Working Paper 10/6 (Cologne: Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, July 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ruby slippers''' are the magic pair of shoes worn by [[Dorothy Gale]] as played by [[Judy Garland]] in the classic 1939 [[MGM]] musical movie ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Because of their iconic stature,&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/online_articles_detail.aspx?id=593 |title=The Ruby Slippers: Inventing an American Icon |author=Dwight Blocker Bowers |publisher=The Lemelson Center |date=January 2010 |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420213857/http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/online_articles_detail.aspx?id=593 |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ruby slippers are now considered among the most treasured and valuable items of [[film memorabilia]].&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; As is customary for important props, a number of pairs were made for the film, though the exact number is unknown. Five pairs are known to have survived; one pair was stolen from a museum in [[Grand Rapids, MN]] in August 2005 and was finally recovered in September of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thief slips away with Dorothy's shoes |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=August 30, 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/aug/30/news2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Sequin Shoes |url=http://redsequinshoes.com/history-of-ruby-slippers/ |accessdate=1 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309092834/http://redsequinshoes.com/history-of-ruby-slippers/ |archivedate=March 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[L. Frank Baum|L. Frank Baum's]] original novel, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' (1900), on which the film is based, Dorothy wears [[Silver Shoes]].

==The slippers==

===''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939)===
In the MGM film, an adolescent farm girl named Dorothy (played by [[Judy Garland]]), her dog [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]], and their farmhouse are swept away from [[Kansas]] by a [[tornado]] and taken to the magical [[Land of Oz]]. The house falls on and kills the [[Wicked Witch of the East]], freeing the [[Munchkin]]s from her tyranny. [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] the [[Good Witch of the North]] arrives via magic bubble and shows Dorothy the dead woman's two feet visibly sticking out from under the house wearing the ruby slippers. When the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] comes to claim her dead sister's shoes, Glinda magically transfers them to Dorothy's feet. Glinda tells Dorothy to keep tight inside of them and never take them off, as the slippers must be very powerful or the Wicked Witch would not want them so badly. Throughout the rest of the film, the Wicked Witch schemes to obtain the shoes. When she captures Dorothy, she tries to take the slippers, but receives a painful shock. The Wicked Witch then realizes that the slippers will only come off if the wearer is dead, so she decides to kill Dorothy. Before she does, however, Dorothy accidentally splashes her with a bucket of water, causing her to melt away. At the end, it is revealed that Dorothy can return home by simply closing her eyes, clicking the heels of the slippers together three times and repeating the phrase, "There's no place like home."

[[File:Arabic ruby slippers.jpg|thumb|right|The curled-toe "Arabian" ruby slippers on display at the auction of the collection of [[Debbie Reynolds]] in [[Beverly Hills]] on June 18, 2011]]
The slippers were designed by [[Gilbert Adrian]], MGM's chief costume designer.&lt;ref name="NMAH"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/news/factsheet.cfm?key=30&amp;newskey=4 |title=Dorothy's Ruby Slippers |publisher=National Museum of American History |accessdate=May 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325042118/http://americanhistory.si.edu/news/factsheet.cfm?key=30&amp;newskey=4 |archivedate=March 25, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; Initially, two pairs were made in different styles. The so-called "Arabian test pair" was "a wildly jeweled, Arabian motif, with curling toes and heels."&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; This pair was used in costume tests,&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; but was rejected as unsuitable for Dorothy's Kansas farmgirl image.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; The second design was approved, with one modification. The red [[Seed bead#Bugle beads|bugle beads]] used to simulate rubies proved too heavy, so they were mostly replaced with [[sequin]]s, about 2,300 for each shoe.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;

It is believed that at least six or seven pairs of the final design were made. According to producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], "We must have had five or ten pairs of those shoes".&lt;ref name="Oz, Aljean Harmetz p. 308"&gt;''The Making of the Wizard of Oz'', Aljean Harmetz, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; The wardrobe woman who worked on the film claimed "six identical pairs" had been made.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; Four pairs used in the movie have been accounted for. Rhys Thomas speculates that they were likely made by Joe Napoli of the Western Costume Company,&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; and not all at once, but as the need arose. Garland requested one pair a half-size larger, as her feet would become slightly swollen in the afternoon from the rigors of morning rehearsals and filming.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} According to Rhys Thomas in his ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article, "all the ruby slippers are between Size 5 and 6, varying between B and D widths."&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;

The four surviving pairs were made from white silk [[court shoe|pumps]] from the Innes Shoe Company in Los Angeles. At the time, many movie studios used plain white silk shoes because they were inexpensive and easy to dye. It is likely that most of the shoes worn by female characters in ''The Wizard of Oz'' were plain Innes shoes with varying heel heights, dyed to match each costume. There is an embossed gold or silver stamp or an embroidered cloth label bearing the name of the company inside each right shoe.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;

To create the ruby slippers, the shoes were dyed red, then burgundy sequined organza overlays were attached to each shoe's upper and heel. The film's early three-strip Technicolor process required the sequins to be darker than most red sequins found today; bright red sequins would have appeared orange on screen.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; Two weeks before the start of shooting, Adrian added butterfly-shaped red strap leather bows.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; Each of the [[Art Deco]]-inspired bows had three large, rectangular, red-glass jewels with dark red bugle beads, outlined in red glass rhinestones in silver settings. The stones and beads were sewn to the bows, then to the organza-covered shoe. Three pairs of the surviving slippers had orange felt glued to their soles to deaden the sound of Garland dancing on the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]].&lt;ref name="NMAH"/&gt;

It is theorized that Garland wore one primary pair during shooting.{{cn|date=December 2018}} 

One pair, known as "the People's Shoes", is on public display at the Smithsonian Institution. According to ''Smithsonian'' magazine, however, the shoes do not belong together; their actual mates are the mismatched pair (left sized 5C, right 5BC) that was stolen in 2005 and recovered in 2018.&lt;ref name="SI2018"/&gt; 

Another pair, the close-up or insert shoes, is in best shape of all, appears to be better made, has no orange felt on the soles and has "#7 Judy Garland" written in the lining.  According to the [[Library of Congress]], "it is widely believed that they were used primarily for close-ups and possibly the climactic scene where Dorothy taps her heels together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/oz/ozsect2.html |title=Ruby Slippers from MGM Film |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circular scuff marks on the soles support the theory that they were the ones Garland had on when she clicked her heels together.&lt;ref name=Starpulse/&gt;  The lack of felt indicates these were likely also the shoes taken from the feet of the dead Wicked Witch of the East (since the soles are visible in the film),&lt;ref name=Starpulse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/09/22/dorothys_ruby_slippers_from_the_wizard |title=Dorothy's Ruby Slippers From 'The Wizard Of Oz' For Sale |publisher=starpulse.com |date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence their nickname: the "Witch's Shoes".&lt;ref name=LATimes2/&gt;

The last known pair was, some believe,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} made for Bobbie Koshay, Garland's [[stunt double]]. This is most likely the size 6B pair (owned first by Roberta Bauman, then Anthony Landini, and currently by David Elkouby) whose lining says "Double" instead of "Judy Garland". However, some believe this pair may have been the second pair created, therefore explaining the "Double" in the lining, but still worn by Garland and Koshay.&lt;ref name=Profiles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bid.profilesinhistory.com/Judy-Garland-Dorothy-Gale-screen-worn-ruby-slippers-from-The-Wizard-of-Oz_i11537055 |title=Judy Garland "Dorothy Gale" screen-worn ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz |publisher=[[Profiles in History]] |date= |accessdate=January 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130131191429/http://bid.profilesinhistory.com/Judy-Garland-Dorothy-Gale-screen-worn-ruby-slippers-from-The-Wizard-of-Oz_i11537055 |archivedate=January 31, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several pairs of Garland's own shoes are size 6{{frac|1|2}}. Also, Garland can be seen wearing this pair in photos taken after the film's primary shooting was finished in 1939.

In one film sequence, Garland is not wearing the ruby slippers. As trees pelt the Scarecrow with apples, Garland can be briefly glimpsed wearing a black shoe on her right foot.

===Subsequent history===
For many years, movie studios were careless with old props, costumes, scripts, and other materials, unaware of their increasing value as memorabilia.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{Cite news |title=Once Movie Trash, Now Collectible |author=Larry Rohter |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=May 26, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/26/movies/once-movie-trash-now-collectible.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, workers would just keep props as souvenirs without permission, aware that their employers did not particularly care.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; One of the more notorious of these was costumer [[Kent Warner]], who amassed a large private collection and supplemented his income with sales. It was he who found the slippers in February or March 1970 while helping to set up a [[Film memorabilia#1970 MGM auction|mammoth auction of MGM props and wardrobe]].&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; They had been stored and forgotten in the basement of MGM's wardrobe department. One pair became the centerpiece of the auction. Warner kept the best pair for himself, size 5B,&lt;ref name=LATimes2/&gt; and apparently sold the rest.&lt;ref name="SI2018"/&gt;

[[File:Dorothy's Ruby Slippers, Wizard of Oz 1938.jpg|thumb|An original pair on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].]]
The slippers in the MGM auction (size 5C) were bought for $15,000 by a lawyer acting for an unidentified client.&lt;ref name="Oz, Aljean Harmetz p. 308"/&gt; This is believed to be the pair on permanent exhibition in the Popular Culture wing of the [[National Museum of American History]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref name="NMAH"/&gt; though the donor insisted on anonymity.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; Dr. [[Brent Glass]], the director of the museum, appeared on the January 23, 2008 ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' with the slippers and informed [[Oprah Winfrey]] that "they were worn by Judy Garland during her dance routines on the Yellow Brick Road because there's felt on the bottom of these slippers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Classic-Americana/15 |title=The Ruby Slippers Travel to Chicago |publisher=oprah.com |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Rhys Thomas, all but one pair had orange felt on the soles.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; The Smithsonian pair is undergoing a rapid deterioration from aging and the museum is raising money to fund research on preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Domonoske |first=Camila |date=October 20, 2016 |title=Save The Ruby Slippers: Smithsonian Seeks Funds To Preserve Dorothy's Shoes |publisher=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/20/498666214/save-the-ruby-slippers-smithsonian-seeks-funds-to-preserve-dorothys-shoes |accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI2018"/&gt;

Another pair was originally owned by a Tennessee woman named Roberta Bauman who got them by placing second in a National Four Star Club "Name the Best Movies of 1939" contest.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Ruby Slippers: A Journey to the Land of Oz |author=Rhys Thomas |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 13, 1988 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-13/entertainment/ca-1511_1_ruby-slipper}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, auction house Christie's sold them for $150,000 plus $15,000 [[buyer's premium]] to Anthony Landini. Landini worked with the Disney Company to start showing them at the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney/MGM Studios]]' Florida Theme Park in the queue for the Great Movie Ride, whose facade and queue area are themed after Grauman's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles.  They were visible at the ride's debut in 1989. Landini auctioned his pair of slippers, again at Christie's East, on May 24, 2000, for $666,000 (including the buyer's premium). They were sold to David Elkouby and his partners, who own memorabilia shops in Hollywood. Elkouby and Co. has yet to display the shoes.

The pair Warner kept, the "Witch's Shoes", was in the best condition. Warner sold the shoes in 1981 to an unknown buyer through Christie's East for $12,000. Two weeks after Landini bought his slippers, this pair resurfaced and was offered privately through Christie's to the under-bidder of the Bauman shoes, Philip Samuels of St. Louis, Missouri. Samuels bought them for the same price that Landini had paid, $165,000. He has used his shoes for fund raising for children's charities, as well as lending them to the Smithsonian when their slippers are cleaned, repaired or (previously) on tour. Auction house [[Profiles in History]] announced that this pair would be the highlight of its December 15–17, 2011 Icons of Hollywood auction.&lt;ref name=Starpulse/&gt; In an interview, [[Joe Maddalena]], head of Profiles in History, estimated that they would go for two to three million dollars.&lt;ref name=Maddalena&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moviepropcollectors.com/magazine/2011/11/17/video-interview-with-joe-maddalena-judy-garlands-ruby-slippers/ |title=Interview: Joe Maddalena &amp; Judy Garland Wizard of Oz Ruby Slippers |publisher=moviepropcollectors.com |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were offered with a starting [[Reservation price|reserve price]] of two million dollars on December 16, 2011, but did not sell.&lt;ref name=Profiles/&gt; Actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and other benefactors, including director [[Steven Spielberg]], made it possible for the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to acquire the pair for an undisclosed price in February 2012 for their forthcoming museum.&lt;ref name="SI2018"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profilesinhistory.com/press-releases/ruby-slippers-acquired-by-academy-of-motion-picture-arts-and-sciences-dp1 |title=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Acquires the Ruby Slippers |publisher=Profiles in History auction house |date=February 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428155049/http://www.profilesinhistory.com/press-releases/ruby-slippers-acquired-by-academy-of-motion-picture-arts-and-sciences-dp1 |archivedate=April 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ruby slippers find a new home at movie academy |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=February 22, 2012 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/02/wizard-of-oz-ruby-slippers-new-home-movie-academy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductions==

===''Return to Oz''===
The ruby slippers play an integral role in the 1985 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film ''[[Return to Oz]]'', for which Disney had to obtain rights from MGM to use reproductions in the film.&lt;ref name="ruby"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waltdisneysreturntooz.com/Ruby.htm|title=Ruby Slipper production notes from ''Return to Oz''|publisher=Walt Disney|accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the originals, the hand-made British French-heeled shoes for ''Return to Oz'' were covered in hundreds of dark red crystals.&lt;ref name="ruby"/&gt; The stones were soaked in sulfuric acid to remove the silver backing,&lt;ref name="ruby"/&gt; and two types of glue were used to affix them to the shoes (a spray glue and an optical glue). No matter what was done, the stones kept falling off during filming.&lt;ref name="ruby"/&gt; Stagehands were specifically hired to sweep up loose "rubies" that would fall off the slippers after a scene was shot. Being little girls, actresses [[Fairuza Balk]] who played Dorothy and Emma Ridley who played [[Princess Ozma]], simply could not keep from playing, skipping and tapping their heels, so eventually they were required to take off the slippers between takes. Effects were later added in post production to give the slippers their magical glow. Simple, red grosgrain ribbon with additional stones were used for the bows. Seven pairs were made for the filming: two pairs, size three for Ridley, three pair (size unknown) for Balk and two men's size 11 for the [[Nome King]] played by actor [[Nicol Williamson]].&lt;ref name="ruby"/&gt;

In 1985, [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]] gave away a pair of slippers to promote the film.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} They were won by a British family, who sold them to prominent Oz collector [[Willard Carroll]] in a 2001 eBay auction.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Western Costume Company===
The Western Costume Company in Hollywood claims to have made Garland's original slippers. While it is likely that Western would have been contracted to make some of ''The Wizard of Oz'''s many costumes, no records of the original slippers exist to either validate or disprove their claim. In 1989, to commemorate the movie's 50th anniversary, Western produced the only authorized reproductions. Hand-[[last]]ed on Judy Garland's original foot mold and completely sequined and jeweled, the reproduction slippers were nearly identical to the originals. Western planned a limited edition of 500 pairs at $5000 each, but halted the project after selling only 16 pairs. One of these pairs fetched $35,000 (including buyer's premium) at a November 25, 2013, auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/21427/##MR0_page=5&amp;MR0_length=10&amp;MR0_category=list&amp;MR0_currency=CAD&amp;m0=0 |title=Lot 44: A Pair of Western Costume Replica Ruby Slippers |publisher=[[Bonhams]] |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other film reproductions===
''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' is a 1993 science-fiction/adventure homage to ''The Wizard of Oz'' featuring red-accented 'Thwomp "Air" Stompers' that allow the wearer to fly upon clicking the heels together. An imitation pair of ruby slippers appeared in the 2002 movie ''[[The Master of Disguise]]''. Another pair appeared in an Oz sequence in the cult comedy ''[[Kentucky Fried Movie]]''.  Reproductions were also featured in ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]''. In this film, Kahmunrah tosses them away after discovering that the rubies are fake.

==Tribute versions==
In honor of the fiftieth anniversary of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the [[Harry Winston, Inc.|Harry Winston]] jewellery company created a size-four pair of slippers using "about 25 carats of diamonds and 1,500 carats of rubies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Ruby Slippers Redux |author= |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 5, 1990 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-05/news/vw-130_1_ruby-slippers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valued at $3 million, they are reportedly the most expensive pair of shoes in the world.

During the fall 2008 [[Fashion Week]] in New York City, the [[Swarovski]] company held a charity contest to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the film, with nineteen designers redesigning the ruby slippers, including [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Diane von Fürstenberg]], and [[Moschino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/080718-wizard-of-oz-70th-anniversary-slipp.aspx |title=Wizard Shoes |publisher=''[[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine |date=July 18, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/dvd/contemporary-designers-re-imagine-dorothys-ruby-slippers-for-charity_article_19064 |title=Contemporary Designers Re-Imagine Dorothy’s Ruby Slippers For Charity |publisher=[[Access Hollywood]] |date=June 10, 2009 |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ruby Slipper Collection: New York Fashion Week|url=http://theshoedish.com/2008/09/09/the-ruby-slipper-collection-new-york-fashion-week/|work=The Shoe Dish|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Arabian" design was displayed with the designer entries.

==Television==
In the 1990–1991 animated TV series ''[[The Wizard of Oz (TV series)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (produced by [[DIC Entertainment|DiC Animation City]]), the ruby slippers' powers are significantly enhanced. Not only do they retain their movie-inspired ability to repel the Wicked Witch of the West's touch, as well as the capability to teleport their user (and an unspecified number of companions) to any location desired, but they also demonstrate numerous other attributes and capabilities as well. Among them are the ability to:
*cloud/block the view of the Witch's crystal ball, but only as long as they remain glowing
*negate, dispel, or reverse hexes or magical energy, used against their wearer, by the Witch
*levitate an object and control its trajectory through the air
*immediately adjust their size/shape to fit their wearer

In this series, Dorothy remains inexperienced and unfamiliar with the shoes' magic, and as such, calls upon their power only as a last resort; often resulting in a [[deus ex machina]] scenario. The Cowardly Lion and Truckle, the Wicked Witch of the West's chief Flying Monkey, also get to wear them briefly.

In the ''[[Charmed]]'' [[Charmed (season 5)|season 5]] episode ''Happily Ever After'', Piper, after going to the Fairytale Castle to vanquish the Wicked Witch, returns home using the ruby slippers.

The slippers briefly appear in the season&amp;nbsp;4 episode "Fractured" of ''[[Warehouse 13]]'' in the Dark Vault, seemingly having a life of their own, accompanied by a witch's cackle and a few notes of "[[Over the Rainbow]]". Supposedly an "Artifact" &amp;ndash; a potentially dangerous and malicious object that grants the wearer dangerous powers &amp;ndash; since many artifacts are based on works of fact and fiction.

The season 9 episode [[Supernatural (season 9)#Episodes|"Slumber Party"]] of the series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' features Dorothy and the Wicked Witch. Dorothy, here portrayed as a hard-as-nails fighter, realizes the shoes are the only thing that can kill the seemingly invincible witch. At one point, she admits she never really wore the iconic shoes, having considered it "tacky" to wear the shoes of a dead witch. Near the end of the episode, Charlie Bradbury uses the shoes to kill the Wicked Witch and foil her plot to bring her armies to Earth and take over the world.

==Books==
According to the revisionist version of the Oz history chronicled in [[Gregory Maguire]]'s novel ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'', the slippers were given to [[Nessarose]], the future Wicked Witch of the East, by her father. They were constructed with handmade glass beads and reflected many different colors in the lighting, giving them an almost chameleon effect. After being enchanted by Elphaba's old best friend and roommate Glinda (the Good Witch of the North), they become items of power that allow the armless and handicapped Nessarose to magically stand and walk independently and without any additional support. In the musical adaptation, ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', it is [[Elphaba]], the Wicked Witch of the West, who enchants the shoes, giving crippled Nessarose the ability to walk without a wheelchair.

''The Ruby Slippers of Oz'' (Tale Weaver Publishing, 1989) by Rhys Thomas is a history of the famous shoes and Kent Warner's part in it.

''At The Auction of the Ruby Slippers'' - a short story in Salman Rushdie's 1994 anthology ''East, West''. Various members of a destitute world attend an auction to bid for the ruby slippers of Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz, in the hope their transformative powers will help them achieve personal and political ends.

==Music==
The progressive band [[Electric Light Orchestra]] used a frame from the 1939 film on the cover of their fourth studio album ''[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Eldorado]]'', released in 1974. The cover was laid out by [[Sharon Osbourne]] (then known as Sharon Arden) and the picture was printed in reverse: the shoes point left in the film.

==Video games==
In ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', the Ruby Slippers are a pair of level 70 epic cloth shoes dropped by the Wizard of Oz-themed "opera event" in the Karazhan raid instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ruby Slippers |work=WoWpedia |url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Ruby_Slippers |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shoes function similarly to the hearthstone that all characters start out with, allowing them to teleport from their current location to the inn where the hearthstone is set. The caption under the statistic lines, much like in the movie, is "There's no place like home."

The slippers are part of the twelve "Foundation Elements" in the toys-to-life video game ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''.

The symbol features three [[hare]]s or [[rabbit]]s chasing each other in a circle. Like the [[triskelion]],&lt;ref name="Widecombe"/&gt; the [[triquetra]], and their antecedents (e.g., the [[triple spiral]]), the symbol of the three hares has a threefold [[rotational symmetry]]. Each of the ears is shared by two hares, so that only three ears are shown. Although its meaning is apparently not explained in contemporary written sources from any of the medieval cultures where it is found, it is thought to have a range of symbolic or mystical associations with fertility and the [[lunar phase|lunar cycle]]. When used in Christian churches, it is presumed to be a symbol of the [[Trinity]]. Its origins and original significance are uncertain, as are the reasons why it appears in such diverse locations.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt;

==Origins in Buddhism and diffusion on the Silk Road==
[[File:Three Hares Symbol - Map.svg|thumb|upright=2.2|right|The spread of the three hares symbol between 600 and 1500]]
The earliest occurrences appear to be in cave temples in China, dated to the [[Sui dynasty]] (6th to 7th centuries).&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="travels"&gt;[http://idp.bl.uk/archives /news18/idpnews_18.a4d [[International Dunhuang Project]] Newsletter No. 18.  ''The Travels of the Three Rabbits: Shared Iconography Across the Silk Road'']. {{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[iconography]] spread along the [[Silk Road]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9AUxnUNRekgC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=Three+hares+running&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OabnwWDpdO&amp;sig=Xkw0E8V8lwLxDA0AXyV91FiHYQE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fAE-TOTQDIK8lQed4_34BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Three%20hares%20running&amp;f=false Whitfield, Susan, ''The Silk Road: trade, travel, war and faith'', p. 290.] London: The [[British Library]].  {{ISBN|1-932476-13-X}}; {{ISBN|978-1-932476-13-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a symbol associated with [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Windling"/&gt; The hares have been said to be "A [[hieroglyph]] of 'to be'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.szasz.com/hare.pdf |title=Staedlin, Naomi, (November 7, 2004) '&amp;#39;The rabbits as a hieroglyph of 'to be'.'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67ArKuuYo?url=http://www.szasz.com/hare.pdf |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other contexts the [[metaphor]] has been given different meaning.  For example, Guan Youhui, a retired researcher from the [[Dunhuang Academy]], who spent 50 years studying the decorative patterns in the [[Mogao Caves]], believes the three rabbits—"like many images in [[Chinese folk art]] that carry auspicious symbolism—represent peace and tranquility."&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.threerabbits.net/ |first1=Chris |last1=Chapman |first2=Zhang |last2=Wei |last3=Rasmussen |first3=Peter |title=The Three Rabbits in China |work=Adapted from a presentation at the International Conference on [[Grotto]]es Research |location=Dunhuang China |date=August 2004|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="travels"/&gt; ''See'' [[Aurel Stein]].

The three hares appear on 13th century [[Mongols|Mongol]] metalwork, and on a copper coin, found in [[Iran]], dated to 1281.&lt;ref name="threehares.net"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.threehares.net | title=The Three Hares | accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://db.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/hares.shtml |title=Chasing Hares |date=16 November 2004 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212064007/http://db.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/hares.shtml |archivedate=12 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tomgreeves.org/the_three_hares.html | title=The Three Hares | author= [http://www.tomgreeves.org/ Tom Greeves] | accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another appears on an ancient Islamic-made [[reliquary]] from southern Russia. Another 13th or early 14th century box, later used as a reliquary, was made in [[Iran]] under [[Mongol]] rule, and is preserved in the treasury of the [[Cathedral of Trier]] in Germany. On its base, the casket has Islamic designs, and originally featured two images of the three hares. One was lost through damage.&lt;ref name="meaning"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Chris |last1=Chapman |url=http://www.chrischapmanphotography.co.uk/hares/index.html |work=Three Hares Project |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67Asmlqi9?url=http://www.chrischapmanphotography.co.uk/hares/index.html |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |title=What does the Symbol Mean? |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory pertaining to the spread of the motif is that it was transported from China across Asia and as far as the south west of England by merchants travelling the [[silk road]] and that the motif was transported via designs found on expensive [[Chinese ceramics|Oriental ceramics]]. This view is supported by the early date of the surviving occurrences in China. However, the majority of representations of the three hares in churches occur in England and northern Germany. This supports a contrary view that the three hares occurred independently as English or early German symbols.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="travels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="puzzle"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.threehares.net/puzzles.html | title=The Three Rabbits and Similar Puzzles | author=Singmaster, David |date = August 2004| accessdate=November 11, 2008| publisher=threehares.net | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918164613/http://www.threehares.net/puzzles.html | archivedate=18 September 2008 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that the Devon name, Tinners' Rabbits, is related to local [[Dartmoor tin-mining|tin miners]] adopting it. The mines generated wealth in the region and funded the building and repair of many local churches, and thus the symbol may have been used as a sign of the miners' patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/three_hares.htm | title=The Tinner's Rabbits | author=Sandles, Tim | publisher=Legendary Dartmoor | date=23 November 2007 | accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ornament (architecture)|architectural ornament]] of the three hares also occurs in churches that are unrelated to the miners of South West England.

==In Christianity==
The motif of the three hares is used in a number of medieval European churches, particularly in France (''e.g.'', in the [[Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière]] in [[Lyon]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourhares.com/ |title=Three Hares at Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière, four hares, and three hares and three wolves, elsewhere. photographs and drawing |publisher=Fourhares.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany. It occurs with the greatest frequency in the churches of [[Devon]], England.

Where it occurs in England, the three hares motif usually appears in a prominent place in the church, such as the central rib of the [[chancel]] roof, or on a central rib of the [[nave]]. This suggests that the symbol held significance to the church, and casts doubt on the theory that they may have been a masons' or carpenters' signature marks.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt; There are two possible and perhaps concurrent reasons why the three hares may have found popularity as a symbol within the church. Firstly, it was widely believed that the hare was [[hermaphrodite]] and could reproduce without loss of [[virginity]].&lt;ref name="meaning"/&gt; This led to an association with the [[Virgin Mary]], with hares sometimes occurring in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Northern Renaissance|Northern European]] paintings of the Virgin and [[Christ Child]]. The other Christian association may have been with the [[Holy Trinity]],&lt;ref name="meaning"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://threehares.blogspot.com/2006/02/why-three-hares_25.html |title=Three Hares as representation of the Trinity |publisher=Threehares.blogspot.com |date=25 February 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing the ''"One in Three and Three in One"'' of which the triangle or three interlocking shapes such as rings are common symbols. In many locations the three hares are positioned adjacent to the [[Green Man]], a symbol commonly believed to be associated with the continuance of [[Anglo-Saxon]] or [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Christianity and Paganism|paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba100/feat5.shtml |title=Green Men &amp; The Way of All Flesh |first1=Richard |last1=Hayma |accessdate=31 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131231951/http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba100/feat5.shtml |archivedate=31 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These juxtapositions may have been created to imply the contrast of the Divine with man's [[sin]]ful, earthly nature.&lt;ref name="meaning"/&gt;

==In Judaism==
In Judaism, the "[[Rock Hyrax|shafan]]" in [[Hebrew]] has symbolic meaning.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;In [[Hebrew]], the rock hyrax is called שפן סלע (''shafan sela''), meaning ''rock "shafan"'', where the meaning of ''shafan'' is obscure, but is [[colloquially]] used as a synonym for rabbit in modern Hebrew. {{cite web|first1=Nosson |last1=Slifkin |authorlink1=Natan Slifkin |work=The camel, the hare &amp; the hyrax: a study of the laws of animals with one kosher sign in light of modern zoology |location=Southfield, MI; [[Nanuet, NY]] |publisher=Zoo Torah in association with Targum/Feldheim Distributed by Feldheim |chapter=6 |title=Shafan–The Hyrax |url=http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |format=PDF |date=1 March 2004 |isbn=1-56871-312-6 |pages=99–135 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616192614/http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} {{ISBN|978-1-56871-312-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although rabbits are listed as a non-[[kosher]] animal in the Bible{{mdash}}they at least arguably chew their cud{{efn-ua|Even though they are not a [[ruminant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://answersingenesis.org/contradictions-in-the-bible/do-rabbits-really-chew-the-cud/ |title=Do rabbits really chew their cud |work=Demolishing Supposed Bible Contradictions |volume=2  |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} lacking [[Cloven hoof|cloven hooves]]{{mdash}}rabbits can carry very positive symbolic connotations, like [[Three Lions (disambiguation)|lions]] and eagles. 16th century German scholar [[Rabbi]] [[Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi]], saw the rabbits as a symbol of the [[Jewish diaspora]].  The replica of the [[Khodoriv|Chodorow]] [[Synagogue]] from Poland (on display at the [[Beth Hatefutsoth|Museum of the Jewish Diaspora]] in [[Tel Aviv]]) has a ceiling with a large central painting which depicts a double-headed eagle holds two brown rabbits in its claws without harming them. The painting is surrounded by a citation from the end of [[Deuteronomy]]:

{{quote|
:.כנשר יעיר קינו על גוזליו ירחף. יפרוש כנפיו יקחהו ישאהו על אברתו
|Deuteronomy 32:11, [[The Song of Moses]]}}

This may be translated: "As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, hovereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her pinions  (...thus is [[God]] to the Jewish people)."&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;

The hare frequently appears in the form of the symbol of the "rotating rabbits".  An ancient German [[riddle]] describes this graphic thus:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Three hares sharing three ears,
Yet every one of them has two.&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This curious graphic riddle can be found in all of the famous [[wooden synagogues]] from the period of the 17th and 18th century in the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashknaz]] region (in Germany) that are on museum display in [[Beth Hatefutsoth]] Museum in Tel Aviv, the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]]  and The [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.  They also appear in the Synagogue from [[Horb am Neckar]] (donated to the Israel Museum). The three animals adorn the wooden panels of the prayer room from [[Unterlimpurg]] near [[Schwäbisch Hall]], which may be seen in replica in the Jewish Museum Berlin. They also are seen in a main exhibit of the Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv. Israeli art historian Ida Uberman wrote about this house of worship: "... Here we find depictions of three kinds of animals, all organized in circles: eagles, fishes and hares. These three represent the Kabbalistic elements of the world: earth, water and fire/heavens... The fact that they are always three is important, for that number . . . is important in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] context".&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;

Not only do they appear among floral and animal ornaments, but they are often in a distinguished location, directly above the [[Torah ark]], the place where the [[Religious text|holy scriptures]] repose.&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;

They appear on [[headstones]] in [[Sataniv]] (Сатанів), [[Khmelnytsky Oblast]], western [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mac.com/ruthellengruber/general_site/Sataniv.html |title=Gruber, Ruth Ellen.

It notes:

:The secret is not great when one knows it.
:But it is something to one who does it.
:Turn and turn again and we will also turn,
:So that we give pleasure to each of you.
:And when we have turned, count our ears,
:It is there, without any disguise, you will find a marvel.&lt;ref name="puzzle"/&gt;

"These are the oldest known dated examples of the Three Rabbits as a puzzle." One commentator believes its being a puzzle is likely reason for the image's popularity.&lt;ref name="puzzle"/&gt;

One recent philosophical book poses it as a problem in perception and an [[optical illusion]]—an example of [[contour rivalry]]. Each rabbit can be individually seen as correct—it is only when you try to see all three at once that you see the problem with defining the hares' ears. This is similar to "The Impossible [[Penrose triangle|Tribar]]" by [[Roger Penrose]],&lt;ref name="puzzle"/&gt; originated by [[Oscar Reutersvärd]]. Compare [[M.C. Escher]]'s [[impossible object]].

In classical, pre-colonial [[Zulu mythology|Zulu myth]], Unkulunkulu brought human beings and cattle from an area of reeds. He created everything, from land and water to man and the animals.

'''Victor Andreyevich Kanke''' (Russian: '''Виктор Андре́евич Ка́нке''') (29 April 1944) is a Russian philosopher born in the village of Nekrasovo, Slavgorod District, [[Altai Territory]] to a German family. He taught physics at school{{which|date=June 2014}} (1966-1974) and philosophy at the Biysk State Teacher Training Institute (1976-1987) and the [[Obninsk Institute for Nuclear Power Engineering]] (since 1987).

== Theories ==
In his doctoral dissertation (1985), Kanke developed the concept of time forms, according to which the nature of [[time]] is always determined by the specifics of the processes in which it is inherent. Time is a measure of the process from its inception to its new state. It is a common mistake to give physical time universal features. But it is an adequate quantitative measure of solely physical processes.

In 1996-2011, Kanke developed the theory of conceptual transitions. According to this theory, [[philosophy]] in its modern form is divided into two parts, namely, substantial and metascientific philosophy. Substantial philosophy, unable to keep pace with science, inevitably takes on a metaphysical form, which is characteristic of post structuralism, critical [[hermeneutics]] and analytic philosophy. In its metascientific form, philosophy has to do with subsciences, examining and criticizing their contents. The metascientific approach is opposed to metaphysics in philosophy and substantialism in Science, according to which science does not need to study metascience. The metascientific approach gives priority to the conceptual structure of modern theories that implement some form of transition from one concept to another.
 
Kanke believes that the metascientific approach is an antidote to SPAM (syndrome of acquired antimetascientificity in sciences) and SPAN (syndrome of acquired antiscientificity in philosophy).

Ethics takes a prominent place in Kanke's theoretical constructions. He believes that modern ethics is built in a substantial manner, so it is dominated by the unscientific syndrome. Genuine ethics is the apex of the philosophy of axiological sciences, it aims at achieving the full potential of the transdisciplinary matrix of modern science, including scientific philosophy.

The theory of scientific transduction involves a comprehensive development of the philosophy of individual scientific disciplines. In this regard, Kanke is known for his [[monograph]]s in the philosophy of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, computer science, economics, history, management, law, pedagogy.

In accordance with the theory of conceptual transitions, Kanke constructs relevant courses in philosophy. He believes that the general arguments about philosophy and the philosophy of science must necessarily be supplemented by a detailed excursion into the conceptual features of various sciences.

Initially serving imperial, private, civic, and religious patronage, Western painting later found audiences in the [[aristocracy]] and the middle class. From the [[Middle Ages]] through the [[Renaissance]] painters worked for the church and a wealthy aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rr17bb/patronage.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:52:16 Discussion of the role of patrons in the Renaissance], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Baroque]] era artists received private commissions from a more educated and prosperous middle class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/artistic-patronage History 1450–1789: Artistic Patronage], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of "[[art for art's sake]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9125149/art-for-arts-sake Britannica.com], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; began to find expression in the work of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] painters like [[Francisco de Goya]], [[John Constable]], and [[J.

The [[history of painting]] reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic artists, and spans all cultures. The oldest known paintings are at the [[Grotte Chauvet]] in France, claimed by some historians to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth, or humans often hunting. There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc. There are many common themes throughout the different places that the paintings have been found; implying the universality of purpose and similarity of the impulses that might have inspired the artists to create the imagery. Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the artists who made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to "catch" their [[soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily, or the paintings may represent an [[animism|animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]], or they may be the result of a basic need of [[Emotional expression|expression]] that is [[essence|innate]] to human beings, or they may be recordings of the life experiences of the artists and related stories from the members of their circle.

[[Ancient Egypt]], a civilization with strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colors), had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]]s.  Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language—called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].  Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today.
Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the dead to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.

To the north of [[Egypt]] was the [[Minoan civilization]] on the island of [[Crete]]. The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to those of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style.

Around 1100 BC, tribes from the north of Greece conquered Greece and its art took a new direction. The culture of [[ancient Greece]] is noteworthy for its outstanding contributions to the visual arts. Painting on [[pottery of ancient Greece]] and [[ceramic]]s gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in ancient Greece functioned. Many fine examples of [[black-figure vase painting]] and [[red-figure vase painting]] still exist. Some famous Greek painters who worked on wood panels and are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis]] and [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]]; however, with the single exception of the [[Pitsa panels]], no examples of ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans.  Zeuxis lived in the 5th century BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes.  Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], and is noted for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color, and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and [[fresco]]es, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy at sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]]. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

The rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. [[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.
Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.
[[File:Giotto di Bondone - No. 18 Scenes from the Life of Christ - 2. Adoration of the Magi - WGA09195.jpg|thumb|[[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]]]

In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and "barbarian" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.

Walls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.

Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as [[International Gothic]] style and was dominant from 1375–1425 with and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gaining importance.

The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, was driven by [[Renaissance humanism]] and the study of classical sources. In painting, in the 1420s and 1430s leading painters in Italy and the [[Low Countries]] separately developed new ways of painting which allowed the paintings to appear more realistic than in the works of established painters, whose style is referred to as [[International Gothic]], or in some cases as Proto-Renaissance (mainly in Italy).  This period, lasting until about 1495, became known as the [[Early Renaissance]].  

In the Flanders area of the Low Countries, following developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], who died in 1416, artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al"&gt;Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., &amp; Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430–437&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose first use on [[panel painting]]s was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]] (who died in 1409), but [[Robert Campin]] (previously known as [[the Master of Flémalle]]) and van Eyck brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism for which they were aiming. With this new medium, the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; 
[[File:La Anunciación, de Fra Angelico.jpg|thumb|[[Fra Angelico]], 1425–1428]]

Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of ancient Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism).  Another important Netherlandish painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], a pupil of Campin, whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists were [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].  Collectively, the advances in painting in Europe north of the Alps is known as the [[Northern Renaissance]].    

In [[Italian Renaissance painting]], the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. [[Masaccio]] is credited with making advances in linear perspective, the depiction of volume in his figures, and in portraying emotions on the faces of his figures in the 1420s.  Then, artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], and [[Sandro Botticelli]], in the [[Early Renaissance]] period lasting to about 1495, and then [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] during the [[High Renaissance]] from about 1495 to 1520, took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic High Renaissance style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.  

Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the [[Northern Renaissance|Northern High Renaissance]] such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] had a different approach than their Italian counterparts, one that is more realistic and less idealized. Some northern painters, beginning with Dürer in the 1490s, traveled to Italy to see works of the Italian High Renaissance and they incorporated the features of the Italian art into their own to varying degrees.A generation later, the start of [[genre painting]] as a subject for large works began with [[Peter Aertsen]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]. A later generation of Northern Renaissance painters who traveled to Rome and adopted much of the idealized approach of the Italian Renaissance became known as [[Romanists]].
[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]], 1520–1523]]

Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]].  [[Printmaking]] became increasingly important, and practiced by many painters. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.

The [[High Renaissance]] in Italy gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]] after 1520, although some painters, such as Titian and [[Paolo Veronese]], continued painting in a High Renaissance style late into the century. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The calm Virgins of Raphael and serene expressions of Leonardo's subjects are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].

Baroque painting is associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]], a movement often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]] and the [[Counter Reformation]] or Catholic Revival;&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows with the purpose of the art being to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. The earliest Baroque painters included the Caracci brothers, [[Annibale Caracci|Annibale]] and [[Agostino Caracci|Agostino]], in the last score of the 16th century, and [[Caravaggio]] in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque painters and an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.  Baroque was the dominant style of painting beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Le Nain]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Georges de la Tour|Tour]],  and [[Claude Lorraine]], who focused on landscape painting.  Poussin, Claude and La Tour, all French, adopted a "classical" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the outine of the figures in the painting than on colour.  Most of these painters traveled to Italy as part of their training and would then take the Baroque style back to their homelands, although in some cases they remained in Italy for large portions of their career (Claude and Poussin).  In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky.

A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.  Dutch Baroque painting is often referred to as [[Dutch Golden Age Painting]].

During the 18th century, [[Rococo]] painting followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic and using light pastel colours. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.

[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]], whose imposing history paintings depicting both historical and contemporary events embodied the ideals of the [[French Revolution]].

After [[Rococo]] there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe [[neo-classicism]], best represented by such artists as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] and his heir [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].

By the mid-19th century, painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. Art became more purely a means of personal expression in the work of painters like [[Francisco de Goya]], [[John Constable]], and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. Romantic painters turned [[landscape painting]] into a major genre, considered until then as a minor genre or as a decorative background for figure compositions.
Some of the major painters of this period are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Théodore Géricault]], J. M. W. Turner, [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and John Constable. Francisco Goya's late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, the work of [[Arnold Böcklin]] evokes mystery, the work of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in England combines assiduous devotion to nature with nostalgia for medieval culture, and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] evoke sophistication, [[decadent movement|decadence]], and the philosophy of "art for art's sake". In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |title=Novack, Barbara '&amp;#39;American Sublime'&amp;#39; Artforum, 2002, retrieved 30 October 2008 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the Hudson River School.
[[File:Johan Barthold Jongkind - Overschie bij maneschijn.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Johan Jongkind]], 1871, a prefiguration of impressionism]]
A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]], whose unidealized paintings of common people offended viewers accustomed to the conventional subject matter and [[licked finish]] of [[academic art]], but inspired many younger artists. The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-François Millet]] also painted landscapes and scenes of peasant life. Loosely associated with the Barbizon School was [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]], who painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as did the paintings of [[Johan Jongkind]] and [[Eugène Boudin]] (who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors). Boudin was an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[plein air]] painting.

In the latter third of the century Impressionists such as [[Édouard Manet]], Claude Monet, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic palette. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air, but not for the traditional purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford, David, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, Ashok Roy, and Raymond White (1990). ''Impressionism''. London: National Gallery. pp. 21–27. {{ISBN|0-300-05035-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they developed a lighter and brighter manner of painting.
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]
Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].

[[Post-Impressionist]]s such as [[Paul Cézanne]] and the slightly younger [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]. For Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism. Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like compositions. The painting technique he developed, called [[Divisionism]], attracted many followers such as [[Paul Signac]], and for a few years in the late 1880s Pissarro adopted some of his methods. Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.

The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms.  The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].

In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Ferdinand Hodler]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustav Klimt]], and the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Mikhail Vrubel]].

Symbolist painters mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[René Magritte]]'s surrealism as "Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Delvaille|Delvaille, Bernard]], ''La poésie symboliste: anthologie'', introduction. {{ISBN|2-221-50161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Henri Matisse's second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. [[Greenwood Press]], 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907),  Picasso created a new and radical picture depicting a brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own Cubist inventions. [[Cubism]] was jointly developed from about 1908 through 1912 by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], whose ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'' (1910) is shown here. The first clear manifestation of Cubism was practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], and [[Robert Delaunay]]. [[Juan Gris]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and others soon joined.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent |title=Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque and Picasso, is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Fauvism]]. The group gained their name after critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] described their work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"),&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

In the first two decades of the 20th century and after cubism, several other important movements emerged; [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[Abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (Kandinsky and [[Franz Marc]]), [[Bauhaus]] (Kandinsky and [[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay|Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka|Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell|Russell]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Theo van Doesburg|van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]] and [[Jean Arp|Arp]]), and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]] and [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]).  Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] architecture and design, to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and [[concrete poetry]] to [[advertising|advertising art]] and fashion.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Fauvism]] was a loose grouping of early 20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]] – friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers.  Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;''The "Wild Beasts" Fauvism and its Affinities,'' [[John Elderfield]], Museum of Modern Art 1976, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fauvism had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907. They had only three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse, ''[[Green Stripe|The Green Stripe]]'', caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight, and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], André Derain went to London and produced a series of paintings including ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]].

By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, and [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]] said of Matisse in an article published in ''La Falange'', "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'' [[William Rubin]], published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Die Brücke]] was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]] and [[Otto Mueller]]. This seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of [[modern art]] in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=bruckemuseumbrucke&gt;[http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm "The Artists' Association 'Brücke'"], [[Brücke-Museum (Berlin)|Brücke Museum]]. Retrieved 7 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]]'' (1909) is seen here, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the Der Blaue Reiter group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved. The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the color of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 Der Blaue Reiter, Tate Glossary] retrieved 10 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the [[avant-garde]] art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. [[Marc Chagall]]'s painting ''[[I and the Village]]'' tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], and some Americans abroad such as [[Marsden Hartley]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as a Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.

American painters during the period between World War I and World War II tended to go to Europe for recognition. [[Modernist]] artists like Marsden Hartley, [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and Stuart Davis created reputations abroad. While Patrick Henry Bruce&lt;ref&gt;Agee and Rose, 1979, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; created [[cubist]] related paintings in Europe, both Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy made paintings that were early inspirations for American [[pop art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2007/08/06/070806craw_artworld_schjeldahl |title=New Yorker article, accessed online 11 November 2008 |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''American Art: History and Culture,'' p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm Jasonkaufman.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017051233/http://jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm |date=17 October 2008 }}, accessed online 28 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Marsden Hartley experimented with expressionism.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]] is generally considered one of the first important painters of [[Modern Art|modern]] [[abstract art]]. As an early [[modernist]],  he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''. Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Swedish painter [[Hilma af Klint]], Russian painter [[Kazimir Malevich]], and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]]. [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color and his experimentation of both depth and tone.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Marcel Duchamp]] came to international prominence in the wake of the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913 where his ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase]]'' became a cause célèbre. He subsequently created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''Large Glass'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for chess) became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zürich, Switzerland]], during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design to advance its antiwar politic and rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. Other artists associated with the Dada movement include [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], and [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]]. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''. The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zürich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was decisive in helping the young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in Surrealist painting. Miró's ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' (1923–1924) verges on abstraction while suggesting a complex of objects and figures and arrangements of sexually active characters; it was Miró's first Surrealist [[masterpiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Miró, Jean Arp, André Masson, and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.

Max Ernst, whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'' is seen here, studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text |title=From the Tate Modern |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], the European art scene was characterized by Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, [[Neue Sachlichkeit]], and Expressionism; and was occupied by masterful [[modernist]] color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]].

In Germany [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] ("New Objectivity") emerged as [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings. The work of these artists grew out of expressionism, and was a response to the political tensions of the [[Weimar Republic]], and was often sharply satirical.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to Surrealism, including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. [[Edinburgh University Press]]. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was the scene of the "[[Bombing of Gernika]]" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.
[[File:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1937, [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]], protest against Fascism]]
''Guernica'' is an immense black-and-white, 3.5 metre (11&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and 7.8 metre (23&amp;nbsp;ft) wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, Laura (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VBHWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75 Art and War]''. I.B. Tauris. {{ISBN|0857732811}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then Scandinavia and London, and in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. Finally in accord with Picasso's wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

From the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s through the years of World War II, [[Visual art of the United States|American art]] was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]]. [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world in the USA. Artists such as [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a pitchfork-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century American art. Art critics assumed it was satirical in intent; it was thought to be part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America exemplified by [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

A renaissance of the arts in Latin America included the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]], the Mexican painter [[Rufino Tamayo]], artists of the Mexican [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] painter [[Frida Kahlo]]. The muralists conveyed historic and political messages. Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, "[[Man at the Crossroads]]", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff.

Frida Kahlo's works relate to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. Her works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are self-portraits, which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden. "Frida Kahlo". Oxford Art Online.

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a movement that combined lessons learned from European Modernists via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors.
 [[File:Newman-Onement 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Barnett Newman]], ''Onement 1,'' 1948. During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]
Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], Hans Hofmann, [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/interactives/156 Abstract Expressionism, NY, MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("American-Type Painting"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:208–229, {{ISBN|978-0807066812}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Abstract expressionism, [[Action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/ppaessay.html|title=Post Painterly Abstraction|author=|date=|website=www.sharecom.ca|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for Abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. Woman V is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, Woman I, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; Woman II, [[Woman III]], and Woman IV. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He finished work on Woman I by November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1 NGA.gov.au], [[National Gallery of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'' (1950), who was labelled an action painter because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color field painting.

During the 1950s ''Color Field painting'' initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]]  and Adolph Gottlieb. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]] – all moving in a new direction.

During the 1930s through the 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post-painterly Abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery in landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects. They include artists as varied as [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], and [[Elaine de Kooning]].

In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still-life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Arshile Gorky's portrait of Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Melissa (2009). "Chronology", in: Michael R. Taylor (ed.), Arshile Gorky: A Retrospective. Philadelphia, Pa.: Philadelphia Museum of Art. {{ISBN|9780876332139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Rachel (2003). ''Abstract Expressionists''.

''[[Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X]]'', 1953 is a painting by the Irish-born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]]. The work shows a distorted version of the [[Portrait of Innocent X]] painted by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied, Wieland (1996). ''Francis Bacon: Commitment and Conflict''. (Munich) Prestel. {{ISBN|3-7913-1664-8}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false [[Fauvism|fauve]] manner."&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt, Michael, ''Anatomy of an Enigma''. Westview Press. {{ISBN|0-8133-3520-5}} (1996), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied (1996), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt (1996), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The figurative work of Francis Bacon, Frida Kahlo, Edward Hopper, Lucian Freud, Andrew Wyeth and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a realist painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's tempera painting, ''[[Christina's World]]'', in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house.&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78455 ''Christina's World''] in the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s Dubuffet (who was always a figurative artist) and de Staël abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël's return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël's late work – in particular his abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s – predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. Milton Avery as well through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glueck |first=Grace |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=miltonavery |title=NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; '&amp;#39;Milton Avery – Onrushing Waves'&amp;#39; |publisher=New York Times |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilton Kramer |url=http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ |title=Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, '&amp;#39;Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'&amp;#39; |publisher=Observer.com |date=2002-05-13 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pop art====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s foreshadow the style and subject matter of Pop art. 

In New York City during the mid-1950s, Rauschenberg and Johns created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works, and the work of Larry Rivers, were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion of mundane materials into their work. Johns' use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the [[American Flag]]; Rivers' paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware River|Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]]; and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]], gave rise to a radical new movement in American art. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as Pop art.

Pop art is exemplified by the artists [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein used oil and [[Magna paint]] in works such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963; [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]]), which was appropriated from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83.&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson| 1988| p= 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] reproduce the appearance of commercial printing. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'', the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (sometimes referred to as ''32 Campbell's Soup Cans'') is the title of an [[Andy Warhol]] work of art that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases of equal size, each consisting of a painting of a [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]] can—one of each [[canned soup]] variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised [[silkscreen]] process, using a non-[[painterly]] style. They helped usher in Pop art as a major art movement that relied on themes from [[popular culture]].

Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;Topics in American Art since 1945, ''Pop art the words'', pp. 119–122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], copyright 1975 by [[W. W. Norton and Company]], NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of English artist [[David Hockney]], such as ''[[A Bigger Splash]]'', and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], are considered seminal examples in the movement.
In New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of Pop art. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront, and the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and Pop Artists like [[Alex Katz]], Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.

====Art Brut, New Realism, Bay Area Figurative Movement, Neo-Dada, Photorealism====

[[File:'Still Life with Cup', oil on canvas painting by Paul Wonner, 1959, private collection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Wonner]], 1959, [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]]] 
During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949] {{en icon}} ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, pp. 31–33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], [[Photorealism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[Pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I,(Landscape No. 1)'' (1963), and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'' (1963) is a typical example, were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Christo]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the Abstract Expressionist movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists.

Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the "death of painting". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada is also a movement that started in the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. This trend, in which manufactured items are combined with artist materials, is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Rauschenberg's "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. Rauschenberg, Johns, [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others created new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Craft, ''An Audience of Artists: Dada, Neo-Dada, and the Emergence of Abstract Expressionism'', University of Chicago, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hapgood, ''Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958–62'', Universe Books and American Federation of Arts, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Colorfield painting]], his work can serve as a bridge between [[Abstract expressionism]], Colorfield painting, and [[Minimal Art]].  Two influential teachers, [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]], introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. Albers is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas.  Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists.  His own paintings form the foundation of both hard-edge painting and Op art.

Josef Albers, Hans Hofmann, [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Fenton, online essay about [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[acrylic paint]], [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials Sharecom.ca], accessed 30 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Al Held]], [[Mino Argento]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-22/entertainment/ca-25065_1_geometric-shapes | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Cathy | last=Curtis | title=Wilshire Center | date=22 January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well. [[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], Neil Williams, David Novros, Paul Mogenson, are examples of artists associated with Minimalism and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and Hard-edge painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Minimalism and shaped canvas painting in New York City during the 1960s.

====Shaped canvas, Washington Color School, Abstract Illusionism, Lyrical Abstraction====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;


[[File:Gardenofdelight.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Ronnie Landfield]], 1971, [[Lyrical Abstraction]]]]
Color Field painting pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Related to [[Post-painterly abstraction]], [[Suprematism]], Abstract Expressionism, [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web&lt;/ref&gt; Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Hans Hofmann, [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists made references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one cohesive, monolithic image. [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]] along with Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis and several others was a member of the [[Washington Color School]] painters who began to create [[Color Field painting]]s in Washington, D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s, ''Black, Grey, Beat'' is a large vertical stripe painting and typical of Gene Davis's work.
[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], Barnett Newman, [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s.

From 1960 Frank Stella produced paintings in aluminum and copper paint and his first works using shaped canvases (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the ''Irregular Polygon'' series (1967), for example. Later he began his ''Protractor Series'' (1971) of paintings, in which [[circle|arcs]], sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. ''Harran II,'' 1967, is an example of the ''Protractor Series''.

The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Color Field painting, shaped canvas painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

Lyrical Abstraction (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Connecticut 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction,'' exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Action Painting, where emphasis is on brushstrokes and high compositional drama, in Lyrical Abstraction—as exemplified by the 1971 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''Garden of Delight''—there is a sense of compositional randomness, relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility. Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], Ronnie Landfield, [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of [[Artforum]] in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007" /&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], Postminimalism, [[Earth Art]], Video, [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Hard-edge painting, Minimal Art, Op art, Pop art, [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Ring of Ronald Davis.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Ronald Davis]], ''Ring'', 1968, [[Abstract Illusionism]]]]
One of the first artists specifically associated with Minimalism was [[Frank Stella]], whose early "stripe" paintings were highlighted in the 1959 show, "16 Americans", organized by Dorothy Miller at the [[Museum of Modern Art in New York]]. The widths of the stripes in Stella's stripe paintings were not entirely subjective, but were determined by the dimensions of the lumber used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint stripes. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and leaned more toward less gestural coloristic field paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]].

Artists such as [[Larry Poons]]—whose work related to Op Art with his emphasis on dots, ovals and after-images bouncing across color fields—[[Kenneth Noland]], Ralph Humphrey, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge]] formats from the late 1950s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com], "Minimalism"&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in Minimalism to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal—as demonstrated by [[Robert Mangold]], who understood the concept of the shape of the canvas and its relationship to ''objecthood''—there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of Minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values.  He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including Jasper Johns, Dan Flavin and Lee Bontecou. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]] [http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman], who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

In a much more general sense, one might find European roots of Minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s painters in the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the movement DeStijl, in [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]] and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. American painters such as [[Brice Marden]] and [[Cy Twombly]] show a clear European influence in their ''pure'' abstraction, minimalist painting of the 1960s. Ronald Davis polyurethane works from the late 1960s pay homage to the ''Broken Glass'' of [[Marcel Duchamp]]''.
This movement was heavily criticised by high modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some anxious critics thought Minimalist art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of Minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried (Art Critic)|Michael Fried]], a Greenbergian critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the Minimalist work of art, particularly Minimalist sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's participation in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of Minimal art.

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art: "The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2015/01/24/less-is-more-ad-reinhardts-twelve-rules-for-pure-art/ ''Less Is More: Ad Reinhardt's 12 Rules for Pure Art''], The Editors of ARTnews, 24 January 2015 (based on a paper read at the 45th annual meeting of the College Art Association at the Detroit Institute of Art, 26 January 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Dan Christensen]], Joan Snyder, [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.

Still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[Monochrome painting]] and [[Hard-edge painting]] inspired by [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and Ellsworth Kelly. Artists as diversified as [[Al Held]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, Minimal art, Hard-edge painting, Lyrical Abstraction, and Postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[Neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in Abstract expressionism, [[Neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and Postminimal painting.

====Neo-expressionism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
In the late 1960s the abstract expressionist painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery.&lt;ref name="Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story"&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/movement-neo-expressionism.htm Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story]&lt;/ref&gt; His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' is an example of Guston's return to representation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 80s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination.  All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]].

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner) in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colors and banal color harmonies. The veteran painters Philip Guston, [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with the slightly younger artists [[Damien Hirst]], [[Anselm Kiefer]], the Americans [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], the Italians [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries.&lt;ref name="Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story"/&gt;

Anselm Kiefer is a leading figure in European Neo-expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/artist-kiefer-anselm.htm The Art Story, Artist Anselm Kiefer]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and [[collective memory]], but also [[occult]] symbolism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/anselm-kiefer-1406 Fiefer, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.

Painting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Esmann, F.

Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, with the advent of [[Modernist art|Modern]] and [[Postmodern art|Postmodern]] art forms, distinctions between what is generally regarded as the [[fine arts]] and the [[low culture|low arts]] have started to fade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ideas About Art |last= Desmond |first=Kathleen K. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;dq=ideas+about+art&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2011 | page= 148}}&lt;/ref&gt; as contemporary high art continues to challenge these concepts by mixing with [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International postmodernism: theory and literary practice |last= Bertens |first=Hans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_Eqx2Gr1vUC&amp;dq=international+postmodernism:+theory+and+literary+practice&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |publisher= Routledge |year=1997 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Władysław Bortnowski''' (12 November 1891 – 21 November 1966) was a [[Poland|Polish]] historian, military commander and one of the highest ranking [[generals of the Polish Army|generals of the]] [[Polish Army]]. He is most famous for commanding the [[Pomorze Army]] in the [[Battle of Bzura]] during the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] in 1939. Also notable for serving as president of the [[Józef Piłsudski Institute of America]] between 1961 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilsudski.org/portal/pl/o-nas/historia/biogramy/196-wladyslaw-bortnowski|title=Władysław Bortnowski|first=Marek|last=Zielinski|website=Pilsudski.org|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and the Great War==
Bortnowski was born on November 12, 1891 in [[Radom]], [[Congress Poland]], [[Russian Empire]]. Upon graduating from a gymnasium in [[Zhytomir]], he enrolled into the [[Moscow State University]] as a medical student, only to transfer after one year to the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]]. There, he completed his medical studies. From 1908, he was a member of the [[Związek Walki Czynnej|Union for Active Struggle]], and from 1912, a member of the [[Związek Strzelecki|Riflemen's Association]]. In 1913, he completed his training as a [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]], followed by his graduation as an officer in the ranks of the [[Związek Strzelecki|Rifleman's Association]]. With the outbreak of the [[World War I|Great War]], Bortnowski interrupted his higher studies and joined the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] where he commanded a platoon in the ranks of the 1st Infantry Regiment. Next, as a [[Second Lieutenant]], he commanded a company in the 5th Infantry Regiment, followed by a position as [[adjutant]] of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the [[1st Brigade, Polish Legions|1st Brigade]]. On Christmas Day 1914, Bortnowski was wounded at the [[battle of Łowczówek]]. Following the events of the [[Oath Crisis]] in 1917, he was arrested and interned at the [[Fort Beniaminów|Fort Beniaminów POW camp]] in [[Beniaminów]] from July 1917 until his release in April 1918. From his release from Beniaminów to October 1918, Bortnowski acted as commander of the Kraków branch of the [[Polish Military Organisation]].

==Polish-Ukrainian War and Polish-Soviet War==
On October 31, 1918, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Bortnowski joined the [[Polish Army]] which was reborn after Poland had regained her [[History of Poland (1918–39)#Formative years (1918-1921)|independence at the conclusion of World War I]]. Initially, he led a company in the 5th Infantry Regiment, and was later promoted to lead a battalion of the 5th Infantry Regiment. In November 1918, he participated in both the [[Battle of Przemyśl (1918)|Sieges of Przemyśl]] and [[Battle of Lemberg (1918)|Lwów]]. From May 1919, Bortnowski worked as a [[Teaching Assistant]] during the very first post-war sessions at the [[Wyższa Szkoła Wojenna|War School of the General Staff of the War College in Warsaw]].

With the onset of the [[Polish-Soviet War]], Bortnowski remained at his teaching position in Warsaw until December 1919. From October 10, 1919, he served as an operations officer of the [[Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division]], composed mostly of his colleagues from the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]]. Next, he served as Chief of the 3rd Operational Group Branch led by [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły|General Edward Rydz-Śmigły]]. Next, Bortnowski served as Chief of the 3rd Branch of the 3rd Army, and from October 1920, as [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the 3rd Army led by [[Zygmunt Zieliński (1858–1925)|Zygmunt Zieliński]].

==Interwar period==
After the conclusion of the [[Polish-Soviet War]], Bortnowski traveled to [[Paris]], France, where he began training at the [[Ecole Superieure de Guerre]] on November 1, 1920. In September 1922, he graduated and returned to Poland where he received further training at various posts, notably in the staff of the Army Inspectorate in [[Wilno]] (modern Vilnius, Lithuania). On August 15, 1924, he was promoted to the rank of [[Colonel]] and in October of the following year, he became the commanding officer of the [[Kutno]]-based 37th Infantry Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} Dziennik Personalny M.S.Wojsk nr 106 z 15.10.1925 r.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup d'État]] in 1926, he served as the Chief of the 3rd Branch of the General Army Staff for two months starting in November. In February 1928, he was appointed commander of the [[26th Infantry Division (Poland)|26th Infantry Division]] in [[Skierniewice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} Dziennik Personalny M.S.Wojsk. Nr 4 z 28.02.1928 r.&lt;/ref&gt; From June 1930, he was transferred to [[Poznań]] where he was appointed commander of the [[14th Infantry Division (Poland)|14th Infantry Division]]. In October 1930, was assigned to the Army Inspectorate in Toruń as an officer. On November 1, 1931, he took command of the [[Zamość]]-based [[3rd Legions Infantry Division (Poland)|3rd Legions Infantry Division]], one of the most prestigious units of the Polish Army.

On January 1, 1932, Bortnowski was promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier General]] by [[Ignacy Mościcki|President Ignacy Mościcki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} Zarządzenie Prezydenta RP z dnia 10.12.1931 r. w: Dziennik Personalny MSWojsk. Nr 10 z 11.12.1931 r., s. 395&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from October 12, 1935, he served as an Inspector General of the Armed Forces at Toruń. In the Autumn of 1938, Bortnowski took command of the [[Independent Operational Group Silesia]] which took participation in the occupation of Czechoslovak territory resulting from the [[Munich Agreement]]. Specifically, Bortnowski's troops occupied the Czechoslovak territory of [[Zaolzie]]. The popularity of Bortnowski after his successful invasion and occupation of Zaolzie was so great back in Poland, that he was planned to replace [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły|Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] as Commander-in-Chief when the latter was to run for the presidency in the planned 1940 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wieczorkiewicz |first=Paweł |date=2006 |title=Historia polityczna Polski 1939-1945 |url= |location=Warsaw |publisher="Książki i Wiedza" |page= |isbn=83-05-13441-5 |accessdate= |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the outbreak of the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|September Campaign]] in September 1939, Bortnowski was promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant General|Division General]] on March 1, 1939, and became the commanding officer of [[Pomorze Army|Pomeranian Army]], the northernmost of the [[List of Polish armies in World War II|Polish armies]] to take part in the war.

==September Campaign==
During the [[September Campaign]], also known as the Polish Defensive War, Bortnowski commanded the [[Pomorze Army|Pomeranian Army]]. Having been surrounded from two sides by Nazi German forces, the Pomeranian Army was forced to fight several bloody battles while retreating southwards towards [[Poznań]] and [[Warsaw]], including the [[Battle of Tuchola Forest]].

On 9 September, Bortnowski subordinated the Pomeranian Army under the [[Poznań Army]] led by General [[Tadeusz Kutrzeba]]. Next, the combined forces of the Pomeranian and Poznań Armies took part in the [[Battle of the Bzura]], a counter-offensive devised by Kutrzeba. Bortnowski's forces were most notable for fighting near the outskirts of [[Łowicz]] and [[Sochaczew]].

On 14 September, he was ordered to retreat onto the northern side of the [[Bzura|Bzura River]] which resulted in the definite retreat of both the Pomeranian and Poznań Armies towards Warsaw. On 21 September, Borntowski was captured by German forces and held as a prisoner-of-war.

==German captivity and post-war life==
Bortnowski spent the rest of [[World War II]] in various Nazi POW camps, such as [[Oflag IV-B Koenigstein]], [[Oflag VIII-E Johannisbrunn]] and finally [[Oflag VII-A Murnau]]. Liberated in 1945 by American forces, he remained in exile after the war. Initially in [[Great Britain]], where he was one of the founders of the [[Józef Piłsudski Institute in London]], he eventually emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1954. He is most commonly associated with the [[Polish Independence League]] and the [[Józef Piłsudski Institute of America]]. He served on the Institute's committee starting November 30, 1954. From June 19, 1955, he served as the Institute's Vice-President, and was appointed President of the Institute in 1961 until 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilsudski.org/portal/pl/o-nas/historia/biogramy/196-wladyslaw-bortnowski|title=Władysław Bortnowski|first=Marek|last=Zielinski|website=Pilsudski.org||accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on November 21, 1966 in [[Glen Cove, New York]]. His funeral took place five days later on November 26, where he was laid to rest at the [[National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa|Our Lady of Czestochowa Cemetery]] in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]], [[Pennsylvania]].

==Controversy==
Prior to his death on September 22, General [[Mikołaj Bołtuć]], an officer serving in Bortnowski's Pomeranian Army, allegedly criticized Bortnowski's leadership during the September Campaign. He supposedly regretted that he had not, ''"during the first days of the war - during the [[Battle of Tuchola Forest]], put a bullet through his (Bortnowski's) head and assumed command."'' Additionally, he allegedly stated that ''"if I die, let it be known that the Army and I died because of this son-of-a-bitch."''

The above-mentioned statements made by General Bołtuć were publicized by General [[Wiktor Thommée]]. On the other hand, Bołtuć's statements regarding Bortnowski and his leadership during September 1939, were contrary to the general opinion of the other officers who had served under Bortnowski's command in the Pomeranian Army.

General Bołtuć, who was remembered positively by Bortnowski himself, was supposedly hot-tempered in both word and action. During the September Campaign, Bołtuć dismissed both commanders of the two divisions which were part of his Operational Group. It is alleged that as a result of the bombardment during the [[Battle of Bzura]], as well as the break-through towards the [[Modlin Fortress]], Bołtuć may have suffered from a nervous breakdown. Bołtuć attributed Bortnowski the series of disastrous events of September 1939 which eventually resulted in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Germany's]] and [[Soviet Russia|Soviet Russia's]] occupation of Poland. Specifically, Bołtuć criticized the "absurd" deployment of three large Polish Army units - the [[Pomeranian Cavalry Brigade]], the [[9th Infantry Division (Poland)|9th Infantry Division]], and the [[27th Infantry Division (Poland)|27th Infantry Division]], into the [[Polish Corridor]], which would allow Germany forces to cut Poland off from access to the Baltic Sea. Bołtuć was correct - General [[Günther von Kluge|Günther von Kluge's ]] [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]] quickly utilized this tactical botch. Kluge and his 4th Army captured the Corridor by smashing through the three Polish units, and cut off the rest of Poland from the Baltic coast, where several Polish coastal defense units remained and were forced to defend alone, which resulted in the notable [[Battle of Hel]].

On the other hand, General Bortnowski had known of this tactical absurdity and had unsuccessfully appealed several times to his superiors prior to the invasion. Bołtuć's reaction and criticisms may be justified through the [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitzian]] philosophy, where the commander of a losing army holds the heaviest burden for the loss, for he holds full responsibility for his army. With this interpretation, Bołtuć's criticisms of Bortnowski are justified in that Bortnowski was the commanding officer of the Pomeranian Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} R. Ziobroń.
