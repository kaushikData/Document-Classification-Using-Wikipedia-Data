'''Adam Hochschild''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|əʊ|k|ʃ|ɪ|l|d}}; born October 5, 1942) is an American author, journalist, historian&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/books/review/spain-in-our-hearts-by-adam-hochschild.html|title=‘Spain in Our Hearts,’ by Adam Hochschild|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lecturer.  His best-known works include ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'' (1998), ''To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914–1918'' (2011), ''[[Bury the Chains]]'' (2005), ''The Mirror at Midnight'' (1990),  ''The Unquiet Ghost'' (1994), and ''[[Spain in Our Hearts]]'' (2016).

==Biography==
Hochschild was born in [[New York City]]. His father, [[Harold K. Hochschild|Harold Hochschild]], was of German Jewish descent; his mother, Mary Marquand Hochschild, was a [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]], and an uncle by marriage, Boris Sergievsky, was a World War I fighter pilot in the Imperial Russian Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Mary|title=Love In Heavy Armor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/books/love-in-heavy-armor.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=2 May 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 15, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam graduated from [[Harvard]] in 1963 with a BA in History and Literature.  As a college student, he spent a summer working on an anti-government newspaper in South Africa and subsequently worked briefly as a [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] worker in Mississippi during 1964. Both were politically pivotal experiences about which he would eventually write in his books ''Half the Way Home: A Memoir of Father and Son'' and ''Finding the Trapdoor: Essays, Portraits, Travels.'' He later was part of the movement against the [[Vietnam War]], and, after several years as a daily newspaper reporter, worked as a writer and editor for the left-wing [[Ramparts (magazine)|''Ramparts'' magazine]]. In the mid-1970s, he was one of the co-founders of ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adam Hochschild Bio at Mother Jones|url=http://motherjones.com/authors/adam-hochschild|publisher=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his writing has been about issues of human rights and social justice.

A longtime lecturer at the Graduate School of Journalism at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Hochschild has also been a Fulbright Lecturer in India, Regents' Lecturer at the University of California, Santa Cruz and Writer-in-Residence at the Department of History, University of Massachusetts at Amherst.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umass.edu/history/about/writerinresidence.html&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]].

==Works==

===Books===
Hochschild's first book was a memoir, ''Half the Way Home: A Memoir of Father and Son'' (1986), in which he described the difficult relationship he had with his father. In ''The New York Times'', [[Michiko Kakutani]] called the book "an extraordinarily moving portrait of the complexities and confusions of familial love."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/21/books/books-of-the-times-coming-to-terms.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults%230&amp;version=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry331%23%2F%22half+the+way+Home%22+Adam+Hochschild ''Coming to Terms''], June 21, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Mirror at Midnight: A South African Journey'' (1990; new edition, 2007) he examines the tensions of modern South Africa through the prism of the nineteenth-century [[Battle of Blood River]], which determined whether the [[Boer]]s or the [[Zulu people|Zulus]] would control that part of the world, as well as looking at the contentious commemoration of the event by rival groups 150 years later, at the height of the apartheid era.

In ''The Unquiet Ghost: Russians Remember Stalin''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/adam-hochschild/the-unquiet-ghost/&lt;/ref&gt; (1994; new edition, 2003), Hochschild chronicles the six months he spent in Russia, traveling to Siberia and the Arctic, interviewing [[gulag]] survivors, retired concentration camp guards, former members of the secret police and countless others about [[Joseph Stalin]]'s reign of terror in the country, during which millions of people (the actual toll will never be known) died.

Hochschild's ''Finding the Trapdoor: Essays, Portraits, Travels'' (1997) collects his personal essays and shorter pieces of reportage, as does a more recent collection, ''Lessons from a Dark Time and Other Essays'' (2018).

His ''[[King Leopold's Ghost|King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa]]'' (1998; new edition, 2006) is a history of the conquest of the [[Congo Free State|Congo]] by [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Léopold II]] of [[Belgium]], and of the atrocities that were committed under Leopold's private rule of the colony, events that sparked the twentieth century's first great international human rights campaign. The book itself reignited contemporary interest and inquiry into the mystery surrounding Leopold's exploitative regime, yet has been subject to critical debate for its historical integrity, sensationalising the event, with [[Jean Stengers]], a leading historian of the time, declaring, ''"Terrible things happened, but Hochschild is exaggerating. It is absurd to say so many millions died."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/may/13/features11.g22|title=The hidden holocaust|date=1999-05-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;echoing critical sentiment that Hochoschild had exaggerated his depiction of the Congo atrocities.

Hochschild's ''[[Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire's Slaves]]'' (2005) is about the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|antislavery movement in the British Empire]]. The story of how abolitionists organized to change the mind of the British public about slavery has attracted attention from contemporary climate change activists, who see an analogy to their own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Azar |first1=Christian |year=2007 |title=Bury the chains and the carbon dioxide |journal=Climatic Change |volume=85 |issue=3–4 |pages=473–5 |doi=10.1007/s10584-007-9303-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Hochschild published ''To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914–1918'', which looks at the era of the [[First World War]] in terms of the struggle between those who felt the war was a noble crusade and those who felt it was not worth the sacrifice of millions of lives. His 2016 ''[[Spain in Our Hearts: Americans in the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939]]'' follows a dozen characters through that conflict, among them volunteer soldiers and medical workers, journalists who covered the war, and a little-known American oilman who sold Francisco Franco most of the fuel for his military. Hochschild's books have been translated into fourteen languages.

===Journalism===
Hochschild has also written for the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', ''[[Granta]]'', the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Nation]]'' and other publications.  He was also a commentator on [[National Public Radio]]'s ''All Things Considered''.

==Statement about writing==
In 2012, Hochschild was given an award for his work by the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]]. He and the other writers receiving awards at the Academy's annual ceremony were asked to write short statements about their work, to be part of an exhibit of their books and manuscripts. His statement is as follows:

{{Quotation|
In my next life I intend to return as a novelist, but in this one, lacking the ability to invent characters, I go looking for them in the real world. But that relieves me of having to pass the hurdle that novelists generally face: is their work believable? As the critic Christopher Benfey once wrote, ‘One advantage of writing nonfiction is that it doesn’t have to be plausible; it just has to be true.’ And so I’ve found my raw material in life itself, sometimes in the present, more often in the past.

I'm particularly attracted to writing about times and places when people felt a moral imperative to confront evil: whether in bearing witness to the prison camps of Stalin’s Soviet Union, battling apartheid in South Africa, exposing the forced labor system that King Leopold II of Belgium imposed on the Congo, working to end slavery in the British Empire, or resisting the madness of the First World War. I’m working now on a book about American volunteers and journalists in the Spanish Civil War. Getting to know some of the men and women who took part in these struggles has taken me to the ruins of gulag camps in the Russian Arctic, to townships, villages and miners’ camps in various parts of Africa, and to the libraries and archives where diaries and letters of people from earlier times can be found. Those journeys in time can be just as moving as the ones in geography: what a thrill it was to page through the small, leather-bound pocket notebook that an abolitionist organizer took with him on a stagecoach trip to Scotland in 1792, filled with accounts of those he met and with admonitions to himself. People sometimes ask me if I’ve ever used a research assistant. Are they kidding? Why would I want to give away to someone else the pleasure of doing such exploring?

If there is a special new technique of writing history, I certainly have not discovered it. All the lessons I try to follow are very ancient ones. Read widely; 'Read,' G. M. Young, the historian of Victorian England, once said, 'until you can hear people talking.' Try like hell to be accurate. Remember how much you don’t know. Write in a way that will make your reader keep on reading.

Is there any profession I would rather have? There isn’t. As a writer you get to insert yourself into other people’s lives. You get to travel in time. And, unlike those in all sorts of other lines of work, from ballerinas to quarterbacks, you never have to retire.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2428">'''Ambrose Christian Congreve''' (14 April 1907–28 May 2011) was an Irish industrialist, best known for his world-famous garden at [[Mount Congreve]]. He won 13 Gold Medal awards at the Chelsea Garden Show in London for this garden.

He was the son of Major John Congreve and Lady Helena Blanche Irene Ponsonby, the daughter of the Eighth [[Earl of Bessborough]]. As a businessman he ran Humphreys &amp; Glasgow, the gasworks manufacturers and petrochemical engineers, from 1939, when he took over from Dr Arthur Glasgow, his father-in-law and a co-founder of the firm. He remained there until 1983, when the company was sold to an American concern.  However, his abiding passion was gardening, especially at Mount Congreve, near [[Kilmeaden]], [[County Waterford]].&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/obituaries/2011/0604/1224298375669.html | title=Obituary | publisher=Irish Times | work=Owner of gardens of worldwide distinction | date=6 June 2011 | accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount Congreve gardens (supplemental ^3) - geograph.org.uk - 506657.jpg|thumb|Mount Congreve woodland garden]]
The Mount Congreve estate lies just outside the village of Kilmeadan. It is famous the world over for its rare species of plants and also its plant nurseries. It consists of around seventy acres of intensively planted woodland garden and a four-acre walled garden. In addition there are an 18th-century house (the ancestral home of Ambrose Congreve), ranges of glasshouses, more than 16 miles of paths and a wholesale nursery. After Congreve's death, aged 104 years, the Mount Congreve estate was left to the Irish State.&lt;ref name="tt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.munster-express.ie/obituaries/late-ambrose-congreve/ | title=Late Ambrose Congreve | publisher=Munster Express | work=Obituary | date=3 June 2011 | accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1757, van Braam joined the [[Dutch Navy]] as a midshipman, but soon left the navy for China in order to work for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).

During his sojourn in China, he left for Europe twice and married Catharina Cornelia Geertruida van Reede van Oudthoorn on his last visit.

In 1773, van Braam left China and the following year, he settled in a county-seat near [[Zutphen]] in the province of [[Gelderland]]. Inspired by the [[American Revolution]], he decided to immigrate to the [[United States]] and settled in [[Charleston, SC|Charleston]] to work as a merchant and rice planter in 1783. He became a US citizen the following year. As a consequence of a family tragedy, van Braam decided to leave the US and take up a position as chief of the Dutch factory in Guangzhou. After a long journey, with stops in the Netherlands, [[Malacca]] and [[Jakarta|Batavia]], he arrived in Guangzhou in 1790.

== Embassy to China ==
Having learned about the British [[Macartney Embassy]] to the [[Qing]] court in 1793, he requested that the commissioners-general in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] send a VOC embassy to the court of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] for the celebration of his sixtieth year on the throne. Batavia accepted the suggestion, but appointed the chief of the Dutch trading mission in [[Dejima]], [[Isaac Titsingh]] (1745–1812) as head of the Dutch embassy instead of van Braam.&lt;ref&gt;van Braam Houckgeest, Andreas Everardus.

[[File:Titsingh route 1794-1795.jpg|left|thumb|Map showing route of Titsingh diplomatic mission to the Imperial Court in Peking (Beijing), traveling from Canton and returning, 1794-1795.]]
In  November 1794, the embassy, which included van Braam and [[Chrétien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes]] (son of [[Joseph de Guignes]]) left Guangzhou and it arrived in [[Beijing]] in January 1795, just in time for Chinese new year.

[[File:VanBraam 1798.jpg|right|thumb|Van Braam's account of the Titsingh mission was initially written in French and published in Philadelphia. This is the title page from the second printing in 1798.]] 
In Beijing, the embassy was received together with representatives of other tributary countries and the members of the embassy performed the [[kowtow]] in front of the emperor according to Chinese custom. Unlike British diplomats, the members of the Dutch embassy did not refuse to perform the kowtow. Van Braam distinguished himself when his hat fell off while bowing, causing the emperor to laugh.&lt;ref&gt;van Braam, ''An authentic account...,'' Vol. I (1798 English edition) pp. 238-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Braam had retained his US citizenship and thus became the first American to meet a Chinese emperor.
 
The embassy was lavishly entertained for the remainder of their stay and they were allowed to have additional audiences with the Qianlong emperor at his palace outside Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;van Braam, ''An authentic account...,'' Vol. I (1798 English edition) pp. 283-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the Titsingh mission, including van Braam, were the last European diplomats to savour the mid-winter splendor of the vast Summer Palace (the [[Old Summer Palace|''Yuangmingyuan'']], now known as the Old Summer Palace) before its destruction by the Lord Elgin's troops during the punitive Second Opium War in 1860.

== Later life ==
Upon the embassy's return to Guangzhou in March 1795, van Braam was unable to find a ship bound for the Netherlands and chose to board a ship to [[Philadelphia]], where he arrived in 1796. Van Braam's arrival in the city attracted a lot of attention and he published an account of his journey, which he dedicated to [[George Washington]]. Van Braam decided to stay in the area and settled in [[Bristol, Pennsylvania|Bristol]] outside the city. In 1798, he decided to leave the United States for unknown reasons, and after short stays in [[Germany]] and [[England]], he bought a small property in Amsterdam, where he died in July 1801.

The '''Lewin B. Barringer Memorial Trophy''' was established by the will of [[Lewin Barringer]] in 1948. The original rules specified that the trophy would be awarded for the longest distance [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]] flight from any type of launching method other than airplane tow. The trophy would become the permanent property of any pilot who won it three times in succession.&lt;ref name="March/April 1948 Soaring"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Barringer Trophy|journal=Soaring|date=March–April 1948|volume=12|issue=3-4|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Paul Bikle]] was the first pilot to win the Trophy three times in succession.  He subsequently donated the trophy back to the [[Soaring Society of America]] as a perpetual trophy.  In 1957 the SSA Directors, with Bikle's approval, changed the rules to allow for any type of launch method and include any flights, other than those flown at the US National Contest.&lt;ref name="Barringer Trophy Summary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barringer Trophy Summary|url=http://www.ssa.org/myhome.asp?mbr=7262842059&amp;show=blog&amp;id=812#Performance|publisher=SSA|accessdate=12 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716201938/http://www.ssa.org/myhome.asp?mbr=7262842059&amp;show=blog&amp;id=812| archivedate= 16 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bhakta Bir Singh Tuladhar''' ([[Devanagari]]: भक्तवीरसिंह तुलाधर) (1912 - 1989) was a Nepalese merchant and philanthropist. He held a special [[Samyak]] (सम्यक) ceremony in 1952 when the country was passing through a political crisis, and the Buddhist alms-giving festival became of crucial importance for both sides in the power struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=|title=Regmi Research Series|page=60 |date=1968 |work=Regmi Research Series, Issues 1-99 |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?ei=RSj-UdCjFcPorQf63YD4DQ&amp;id=8ghDAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=samyak+1952&amp;q=samyak+1952#search_anchor |location = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Business in Tibet==

Bhakta Bir Singh was born to father Samyak Singh (also known as Samek Ratna)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= von Fürer Haimendorf |first=Christoph |date=1966 |title=Caste and Kin in Nepal, India and Ceylon: Anthropological Studies in Hindu-Buddhist Contact Zones |url=https://books.google.com.np/books/about/Caste_and_Kin_in_Nepal_India_and_Ceylon.html?id=dZE9AAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |publisher=Asia Publishing House |page=128 |accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mother Sānu Māyā [[Tuladhar]] in [[Kathmandu]]. The family home was located at Nhyokhā (न्ह्योखा), a neighborhood in the historical section of Kathmandu. He was married to Laxmi Hirā [[Kansakar]], and was popularly known as Bhagat Sāhu.

The Tuladhars owned a business house in [[Lhasa]], and following in the footsteps of his merchant ancestors, Bhakta Bir Singh went to [[Tibet]] to manage the family shop at a young age. He divided his time between Kathmandu, Lhasa and [[Kalimpong]] in India, a trade center and staging point for mule caravans to Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuladhar|first=Kamal Ratna|publisher=Lijala &amp; Tisa |year=2011 |page=109 |title=Caravan to Lhasa: A Merchant of Kathmandu in Traditional Tibet |edition=2nd |url= |accessdate=|isbn=99946-58-91-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samyak and the revolution==

Bhakta Bir Singh's father Samyak Singh had made a pledge in 1950 to sponsor a special Samyak next year, and issued invitations to the ceremony, but he died while the preparations were being made. His sons went ahead with the arrangements to hold it as scheduled. However, the Nepalese revolution broke out, and their plans got caught in the middle. Since Samyak requires the presence of the head of state, Bhakta Bir Singh and his brothers were put in a difficult position regarding whom to invite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gautama |first= Rājeśa |editor-first= |editor-last= |title= Nepali Congress |url= |publisher= Adroit Publishers |date= 2005 |page=367 | isbn=9788187392613}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 1950, [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]] went into exile in [[New Delhi]], [[India]] in an attempt to bring down the [[Rana dynasty|Rana regime]] which held real power in the country. The Ranas then made his grandson [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nepalresearch.com/history/background/revolution_1950.htm |title= The Revolution of 1950/51 |last= Kraemer |first= Karl-Heinz |date= |website= |publisher= Nepal Research |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They pressed Bhakta Bir Singh to hold Samyak with Gyanendra presiding over it in order to grant him cultural endorsement. The freedom fighters, meanwhile, threatened him not to do so. Bhakta Bir Singh found a way out of the dilemma by citing his father's recent death and deferring the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuladhar |first=Daman Raj |editor-first= |editor-last= |title=Contemporary Nepal, 1945-1955 |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?ei=w88MUqHXCsPSrQfzvICoBQ&amp;id=Qe8cAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=samyak+daya+bir+singh&amp;q=daya+bir+singh#search_anchor |publisher=Laxmi Publications |date=1980 |page=243 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Ranas were overthrown in February 1951, and Tribhuvan returned to Nepal. A year later, the postponed Samyak was held on 15 January 1952 with Tribhuvan presiding over it. A stone [[mandala]] was installed at the venue at [[Bhuikhel]] to commemorate the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shakya |first= Hem Raj |publisher= Svayambhu Vikash Mandala |year=2004 |page=617 |title= Sri Svayambhu Mahacaitya |edition=1st |url= |accessdate=|isbn=99933-864-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious celebration was seen as an affirmation of the king's triumph in the power struggle against the hereditary prime ministers the Ranas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |editor-first= Katia |editor-last= Buffetrille |title= Revisiting Rituals in a Changing Tibetan World |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=hfAkbA89Lp0C&amp;dq=samyak+tribhuvan&amp;q=232#v=snippet&amp;q=232&amp;f=false |publisher= BRILL |date= 2012 |page=232 | isbn=9789004232174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samyak commemorates the practice of giving to the Buddhas and monks in the [[Newar Buddhism|Newar Buddhist]] tradition. It is spread over three days, and is held at [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]] and the field at the foot of [[Swayambhu]] hill. During the ceremony, hundreds of images of [[Dīpankara Buddha]] are assembled, and gifts of different types of food are made to the deities and the Buddhist community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lewis |first= Todd Thornton |authorlink= |title= Popular Buddhist Texts from Nepal: Narratives and Rituals of Newar Buddhism |url= https://books.google.com.np/books?id=pC_XoZsvBuIC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=samyak+nepal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2uj7UeXdOs2krQfIrIHgCA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=samyak%20nepal&amp;f=false |accessdate=8 August 2013 |year=2000 |publisher= State University of New York Press |location= |isbn= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Todd T. |title=Notes on the Uray and the Modernization of Newar Buddhism |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_23_01_08.pdf |accessdate=8 August 2013 |newspaper=Contributions to Nepalese Studies |date=January 1996}} Page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brickell''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|k|əl}} {{respell|BRIK|əl}}) is an urban [[neighborhoods of Miami, Florida|neighborhood]] of [[Downtown Miami|Greater Downtown]] [[Miami]], [[Florida]], [[United States]].  Directly south of the [[Central Business District (Miami)|historic CBD]], Brickell is Miami and [[South Florida]]'s major financial district.

Brickell was settled in the [[modern era]] in the mid-19th century by early pioneers, growing to become Miami's "[[Millionaires' Mile|Millionaire's Row]]" in the early 20th century after the construction of lavish mansions along [[Brickell Avenue]] by [[Mary Brickell]]. By the 1970s, office towers, hotels and apartments began replacing the historic mansions. Today, Brickell has grown to overtake the city's [[Downtown Miami Historic District|historic central business district]] to the north, as one of the largest [[financial district]]s in the [[United States]]. With a fast-growing residential population, Brickell is one of Miami's fastest-growing as well as its most [[population density|dense]] neighborhood, with a 2010 population of about 31,000.&lt;ref name=DDA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miamidda.com/pdf/Goodkin-Focus-DDAPopulationRpt_201109_Final.pdf|title=Population &amp; Demographic Profile|publisher=Miami DDA|date=September 2011|accessdate=March 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127100255/http://miamidda.com/pdf/Goodkin-Focus-DDAPopulationRpt_201109_Final.pdf|archive-date=November 27, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Brickell has traditionally been known as a financial district, in recent years, construction of numerous condominium and apartment towers in Brickell, has extended the upscale residential neighborhood feel of lower Brickell into upper Brickell. Recent construction in Brickell has also enlarged the urban core of Brickell from Brickell Avenue west to the [[Metrorail (Miami)|Metrorail]] line, with new office and residential towers, such as [[Axis at Brickell Village]]. As of 2010, 80,000 residents live in Brickell, among them, famous celebrities such as [[José José]], [[Luis Miguel]], [[Clinton Portis]], [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Marc Anthony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamicondoinvestments.com/miami-condos/jennifer-lopez-marc-anthony-to-acquire-10-units-at-icon-brickell |title=Jennifer Lopez &amp; Marc Anthony To Acquire 10 Units at Icon Brickell &amp;#124; Miami Condos &amp;#124; Miami Real Estate |publisher=Miamicondoinvestments.com |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the center of Brickell is [[Mary Brickell Village]], with an assortment of restaurants, boutiques, services that create a gathering area for high-class retail and restaurants. Some the best and most well-known names are leasing space in the project. The project is designed after a French-style village and attracts social gathering and entertainment.

==Sub-districts==
[[File:DaySouth.jpg|thumb|right|An aerial of the Brickell area distinctly illustrating the boundaries.]]
Historically, all of Brickell was a wealthy suburb. As the downtown area expanded, the northeastern part of Brickell adopted high-density zoning that allowed high rise construction centered around Brickell Avenue, while south of 15th Street zoning remains highly limited with the exception of the very coastline east of Brickell Avenue. West of the Metrorail line, "west Brickell" melded with Little Havana until sweeping [[gentrification of Miami|gentrification]] took place in the 2010s. The subdivisions of Brickell are recognized by the Downtown Development Authority.&lt;ref name="DDA2009"/&gt;

===West Brickell===
[[File:West Brickell, 2011.jpg|thumb|left|West Brickell in 2011 before a second high rise building boom in the 2010s]]
West Brickell is a sub-neighborhood of Brickell, west of the [[Metrorail (Miami-Dade County)|Metrorail]] line (SW 1st Avenue), and east of [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]], south of the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]], and north of SE 15th Road (Broadway). It is primarily a residential neighborhood, made up mostly of low to mid-rise [[apartment]] buildings. In the 2010s Miami condominium boom that began in 2012, interest in Brickell spilled over into West Brickell, with mid-century and prewar buildings being replaced by larger buildings. However, they included [[affordable housing]] and were generally non-luxury.

===South Brickell===
South Brickell is a sub-neighborhood of Brickell, south of SE 15th Road (Broadway) to the [[Rickenbacker Causeway]], east of [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]], west of [[Biscayne Bay]]. It is primarily a residential neighborhood with [[single-family homes]] from the early-1900s along [[Miami Avenue|South Miami Avenue]] and [[high-rise]] residential towers along the east side of [[Brickell Avenue]].&lt;ref name="miamidda.com"/&gt;

===Financial district/"Brickell"===

Brickell was often referred to as the "Brickell Financial District", or just "Financial District", during the time of large-scale commercial office development, including major banks building headquarters there. The "[[financial district]]" area is what today comprises the core of Brickell, which has become overtaken by high rise residential buildings, and is hence referred to as simply "Brickell".

Public Transportation in the [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]]/Brickell area is used more than in any other part of Miami and is a vital part of Brickell life. [[Miami Metrorail|Metrorail]], Miami's [[heavy rail]] system, has one station in Brickell at the [[Brickell (changeover station)|Brickell Station]]. In addition to Metrorail, the [[Metromover]] train system runs 3 lines throughout Downtown (the Downtown Loop, the Omni Loop, and the Brickell Loop). The Metromover connects with Metrorail and is free. Metromover stations can be found at roughly every two blocks in Brickell.

Metrorail has stops throughout Miami with connections to [[Miami International Airport]], all Miami-Dade County bus lines, [[Tri-Rail]] and [[Amtrak]]. The main bus station in Downtown is located next to the Arsht Center at the [[Adrienne Arsht Center (Metromover station)|Adrienne Arsht Center Station]].

As an urban and [[pedestrian-friendly]] area with an extensive [[public transit]] network, Brickell (along with [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]], Omni, and [[South Beach]]) is one of the areas in Miami where a car-free lifestyle is commonplace. Many Brickellites get around by foot, bicycle, [[Metromover]] or by taxi. The Metromover is a popular alternative to walking in the area, especially on rainy, hot or cold days, as the Metromover is free, and stations are located roughly every two blocks throughout the area.

Recently, the City of Miami, along with the Downtown Development Authority, has begun bicycle initiatives promoting citywide bike parking and [[bike lanes]], that have made bicycling much more popular for residents. [[Bike lanes]] and [[Shared lane marking|bike sharrows]] are currently planned for the majority of Downtown streets to be painted by the end of 2010. Decobike, the popular bike sharing program in Miami Beach, has announced a launch in Brickell/Downtown Miami in Mid 2014. The [[Venetian Causeway]] is a popular bicycle commuter route that connects [[South Beach]] to Downtown. The [[Rickenbacker Causeway]] is very popular on weekends for recreational bicyclists, and often, bicycles can outnumber cars on the causeway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.transitmiami.com/2010/07/17/do-cyclists-and-pedestrians-outnumber-cars-on-the-rickenbacker-causeway-on-weekend-mornings/ |title=Do bicyclists and pedestrians outnumber cars on the Rickenbacker Causeway on weekend mornings? |publisher=Transit Miami |date=July 17, 2010 |accessdate=July 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106222951/http://www.transitmiami.com/2010/07/17/do-cyclists-and-pedestrians-outnumber-cars-on-the-rickenbacker-causeway-on-weekend-mornings/ |archivedate=January 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxis===
Taxis are popular in Brickell, especially from Brickell to [[South Beach]], [[Miami Design District|Design District]] or to [[Coconut Grove]]. Since many Brickell residents choose to not have cars, taxis are also popular for rides within Downtown neighborhoods, especially after midnight when the [[Metromover]] stops running. Taxis can be hailed on the street, or phoned.

==Historic Brickell==
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
{{Main|National Register of Historic Places listings in Miami, Florida}}
{{See also|Downtown Miami Historic District}}
With rapid urbanization over the decades, very little remains of the original character of Brickell. Brickell was originally platted for [[mansion]]s and large homes by [[Mary Brickell]], which thus led to the name "Millionaire's Row."  With the growth of the city, especially in the 1970s onwards, Brickell's character began to change with the construction of [[high-rise]] office towers along [[Brickell Avenue]], and high-rise residential towers in lower Brickell, south of SE 15th Road (Broadway). A commercial boom in the 1980s, brought mass construction of office towers to Brickell, and subsequent construction, would further change the neighborhood into the dense, urban, residential and commercial neighborhood it is today. Some of the historic buildings remaining in Brickell can be seen in the photos below. While not a [[National Register of Historic Places|registered historic landmark]], Brickell is home to [[Tobacco Road (bar)|Tobacco Road]], which claimed to be Miami's oldest bar, in business since 1912,&lt;ref name=stayopenCBS&gt;{{cite news|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2012/05/11/tobacco-roads-three-year-lease-may-mark-the-closure-of-miamis-oldest-bar/|title=Tobacco Road’s Three Year Lease May Mark The Closure Of Miami’s Oldest Bar|publisher=[[WFOR-TV]]|date=May 11, 2012|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a now-demolished building built in 1915.

'''Kapitan Chung Thye Phin''' MSC, JP ({{zh|c=鄭大平|p=Zhèng Dàpíng|s=|t=|pfs=Chhang Thai Phìn}}; 1879 - 1935) was a wealthy [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malayan]] tin miner and rubber planter&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Business in Southeast Asia: Contesting Cultural Explanations by Edmund Terence Gomez, Hsin-Huang Michael Hsiao, Page 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 10 September 1925, Page 8 -- Capitan Chung Thye Phin has sold his large rubber estate, situated in Sungei Siput, for an amount exceeding $700,000, the purchasers being Messrs. Barlow and Co., Kuala Lumpur. The Times of Malaya understands that the sale was put through by a well known Chinese business man of Penang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He was appointed a member of the Federation Malay States Rubber Restriction Committee in 1922 - The Straits Times, 28 October 1922, Page 8 National Library of Singapore microfilm reel NL499&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The rise of ersatz capitalism in South-East Asia - Page 203&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Hakka people|Hakka]] ancestry who was raised on the island of [[Penang]] in the state of the same name in [[Malaysia]], known at that time as [[British Malaya]]. He pioneered the cultivation of Roselle for the production of Roselle fibre rope and twine, his initial effort including the Sweet Kamiri Estate in Sungei Siput.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 2 September 1922, Page 11 -- NEW MALAYAN INDUSTRY. -- That success is attending the efforts of planters who several months ago went in for Roselle fibre is evident from a notice appearing in the advertisement columns of our Ipoh contemporary, announcing that at the present time rope made of this fibre can be obtained at 24 cents per lb, F.O.R. Sungei Siput! The advertisement states that not only are "all sizes of rope up to 3 1/2 inch circumference in stock," but that the Manager of Sweet Kamiri Estate, Sungei Siput, is prepared to supply "any larger size" to order. Credit in this connection for most praise-worthy enterprise, for thus setting an excellent example to the general public, is, if we mistake not, due to Mr. Chung Thye Phin, the Captain China, who was among the first, if not the very first, to invest in this kind of product, making his initial effort at Sweet Kamiri Estate, Perak, many months ago. Since then, as was mentioned in our columns recently scores of planters in all parts of the Peninsula have gone in for Roselle fibre, the prospects of this useful commodity figuring regularly among our exports before very long being excellent. For twine and rope-making it is admirably adapted and as the plant flourishes in Malaya and native labour is cheap there is no reason why the manufacture of rope in Malaya should not become just as important an industry in the near future as that of the enterprising China Clay and Pottery Company, of Gopeng, for which Messrs McAlister * Co., Ltd., are, the local agents. (S. Echo.)&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Perak Advisory Board and the last ''[[Kapitan China]]'' of [[Perak]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]].&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 5 October 1903, Page 5, National Library of Singapore microfilm reel NL294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DEATH OF CAPITAN CHUNG THYE PIN.

There were approximately 200 mourners, including the deceased's wives, children, and grandchildren. The procession was a quarter of a mile long. Innumerable Chinese banners, Chinese priests, the Municipal Band, and Boys Scouts from the Second Penang (A.C.S.) Troop, under S.M. Yeoh Seng Chan, former the almost unending train, which was brought up in the rear by the coffin and finally the mourners and followers. Many prominent local and outstation men were present including Hon. Mr. Palgrave Simpson, Mr. [[Leong Sin Nam]], Mr. [[Cheah Cheang Lim]], [[Dato Panglima Kinta]] and Mr. [[Heah Joo Seang]]. The procession started shortly after 11 a.m., proceeding down [[Northam Road]] into Transfer Road and Sri Bahari Road, to come out into [[Penang Road]]. The train broke up at the junction of Burma and Penang Roads, from where the coffin was borne up to Bagan Jermal for burial in a private piece of land in the estate of the late Cheang Keng Kwee. After the burial ceremony was over at the grave side, the procession proceeded home.&lt;/ref&gt;

== A Famous Pedigree ==
Kapitan [[Chung Keng Quee]], Mandarin 2nd Class of the Imperial Chinese Court and leader of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] secret society in British Malaya had nine male issue, the 4th and best known of whom was Chung, Thye-phin. Chung Thye Phin's Ch'i Yeh or godfather was Chin Seng Yam (Chin Ah Yam), the leader of the Ghee Hin, once the enemy of his father who was leader of the opposing Hai San, both factions (Ghee Hin and Hai San) fighting for domination of the tin fields of Larut.

== A Child of Taiping and Georgetown ==
Kapitan Chung Thye Phin was born 28 Sep 1879 in Kota,&lt;ref&gt;The principal village in Taiping at the time of the [[Larut war]]s was Kota which was about four kilometers from Klian Pauh: Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 64 By Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

An enterprising youth with a flair for progress, he later started a number of tin mines of his own, including a deep-shaft mine at [[Tronoh]] or [[Teronoh]], adjoining the famous mine of the same name, and the hydraulic mine at Batu Tugoh. [[Tronoh]] was the centre of the mining field containing the mine of Chung Thye Phin's Tronoh Mines Company Ltd.&lt;ref name="arnold"/&gt;

His open-cast mines were operated on the most modern system in his time. He had the distinction of being the first Chinese miner to have introduced the latest appliances on the mines, under the supervision of a European engineer.&lt;ref name="arnold"/&gt;

In 1914 he was elected to the council of the F.M.S. Chamber of Mines.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 3 March 1914, Page 3 -- F.M.S. Chamber of Mines.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the smelting industry in Singapore has led to the formation of a syndicate to enter into competition with the Straits Trading Company. With a capital of $1,250,000, divided into 125,000 shares of $10 each, the Eastern Smelting Company has been registered recently at Penang, and application is now being made to the Federated Malay States Government for permission to export ore. We understand that the concern is composed chiefly of Straits-born Chinese. The export restrictions were aimed, it is stated, at the formation, some time since, of an American tin trust. It is believed that another syndicate, with a similar object in view, is in course of formation.&lt;/ref&gt; and in November that year, its prospectus was advertised in various newspapers offering shares to the public.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 26 November 1907, Page 1 -- The eastern Smelting Company Limited.

It is proposed to form this Company to purchase and take over as a going concern the well-known business of Tin Smelting carried on during the past 10 years by Mr. Lee Chin Ho of No 73, Dato Kramat Road, Penang, together with the Smelting works and premises belonging thereto and situate at No. 73, Dato Kramat Road, Penang, and all the plant machinery, furnaces, chimney stacks, fixtures, engines, motors, office furniture, implements and permanent appliances whatsoever used in connection therewith and the goodwill of the business and generally to carry on the business of Tin Merchants, Tin Smelters and Tin Refiners. The total purchase price payable to the Vendor Mr. Lee Chin Ho is $300,000 of which $150,000 represents the value of the works and premises and the plant machinery &amp;c., used in connection therewith and $150,000 is the amount payable for the Goodwill. The purchase price will be paid as to $250,000 in fully paid up shares in the Company and as to the balance of $50,000 only in Cash. Arrangements have also been made for taking over the stock and the benefit of all contracts which have been entered into by the Vendor in connection with the business and which shall be in existence at the date of the completion of the purchase at the price to be agreed upon between the Vendor and the Company or in default of agreement at a price to be settled by arbitration. There are at present four furnaces on the premises and the works are capable of turning out 25 tons of refined tin per day. There is  ample space upon the premises in Dato Kramat Road for the erection of more than double the present number of furnaces. It is intended to establish Agencies in the Federated Malay States and elsewhere to buy ore and it is estimated that the present output of refined tin which now averages from 250 to 300 tons per month will be increased to between 800 and 1,000 tons per month. Mr. Herman Jessen, who during the last 6 years has been with the firm of Messrs. Behn Meyer &amp; Co., has had considerable experience in the tin business and will act as the first Managing Director of the Company upon terms to be arranged between himself and the Company. Mr. Lee Chin Ho has also promised the Company the full benefit of his services, skill and experience for the next 3 years at least. The business will be carried on and conducted upon the most modern and up to date lines. All preliminary expenses down to and including the day on which the Company is entitled to commence business will be paid by the Company but no promotion money will be paid. One Hundred Thousand Shares in the Company have already been privately applied for; 25,000 shares go to the Vendor in part payment of the purchase money and the remaining 25,000 Shares are now offered to the Public for subscription at par. As a large number of the leading Tin Miners in the Straits and F. M. S. have applied for the bulk of the Shares in the Company the Directors have every confidence in the future success of the Company. A Contract dated the 27th day of July 1907, has been entered into between Lee Chin ho of the one part and Herrmann Jessen of Penang for and on behalf of the Company of the other part for the sale and purchase of the business of the Company and copies of such Contract can be inspected at the premises of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China in Penang, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Taiping and Medan during the usual business hours until the Subscription list is closed. Application for Shares should be made on the accompanying forms and forwarded to the Company's Bankers at Penang with a remittance for the amount payable on application not later than 30 November 1907. Where no allotment is made the deposit will be returned in full. For the purpose of facilitating the transfer of Shares the Company will have power to issue Share Warrants to Bearer in respect of any fully paid-up Shares of the Company upon such terms and subject to such conditions as may be resolved upon by the Directors. Prospectuses and forms of application can be obtained at the offices of the Company or from the Company's Bankers or Solicitors.

OPENING OF EASTERN SMELTING WORKS. Governor's Speech. COMPETITION WITH STRAITS TRADING COMPANY. Opening Ceremony Performed by Miss Anderson. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) Penang, 18, 10 January.20a.m. His Excellency the Governor, Sir John Anderson, K.C.M.G., participated in the opening of the Eastern Smelting Company here to-day. In a speech delivered by His Excellency, he alluded to the present depression in the tin industry, which had been produced by the grave shock sustained by the credit of the markets of the world, and especially by the United States. This depression in the markets, the mining industry in the Federated Malay States had been unable to withstand, and he feared, looking to the history of similar depressions in the past, that the end had not yet been reached. His Excellency also referred to the competition of the Eastern Smelting Company with one of the greatest institutions in the Colony -- the Straits Trading Company. He expressed himself as confident that there would be no cut-throat competition between the two concerns, as there were level-headed men at the head of both. We did not want monopolists in the Colony and Federated Malay States, bu healthy competition resulting in a reasonable margin of profit. His Excellency then dealt with the prospects of the Eastern Smelting Company, with Penang as the gate of Perak and the Siamese Malayan States. The Governor was presented by the management of the new Company with an address in a silver casket. Thereafter, the gubernatorial party went over the works and viewed the smelting process. Miss Anderson opening the works with a gold key, which was thereupon presented by the management for her acceptance.&lt;/ref&gt; The company appeared to be doing well and at its first ordinary general meeting in October that year a 5 per cent dividend was declared based on the good performance of the prior six months work.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 22 October 1908, Page 8 -- Promising Future for the Eastern Smelting Company. The first ordinary general meeting of the Eastern Smelting company, Limited, was held on Thursday afternoon at the company's registered offices at Penang. The Managing Director, Mr. Herrmann Jessen, occupied the chair and gave a resume of the company's work for the last six months, which was regarded by the large number of shareholders present as very satisfactory. The Chairman said that the Directors were in the happy position of being able to declare an interim dividend of 5 per cent. This would absorb half of the net profit earned during the half-year. The Chairman was very glad to be able to assure the meeting that the outlook for the future was very promising. Mr. J. D. Ke,p. of the Rahman Tin Company, was then elected unanimously to the vacant seat on the Board of Directors, and, with a vote of thanks to the Chairman, the proceedings terminated.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arose the following year and by the end of it its works manager had resigned, accusing the managing director and other directors of financial mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 2 November 1909, Page 7 -- EASTERN SMELTING CO.

[Articles] -- Eastern Smelting Co. ACRIMONIOUS AND PERSONAL RECRIMINATIONS. Protracted Meeting. (From Our Own Cobrbspondbnt.) Penang, 11 November. A crowded meeting of the Eastern Smelting Company was held here yesterday and a protracted sitting took place. Messrs. Jessen and Robertson occupied a considerable time in acrimonious and personal recriminations. Mr. Robertson declared under Jessen the Company lost $76,000 in tin dealings with London in 1908, and $1,100 in 1909.  He also stated Jessen had overdrawn his private accounts by $21,000 and had taken shares for the Company in mining ventures which proved unsuccessful. Jessen rejoined that everything had been done with the knowledge and approval of the board. They had repaid the overdraft. He asserted the unsatisfactory state of the Company's affairs was due to Robertson's failure to keep proper accounts at the Works, incorrect estimates and to refusal to co-operate with the head office. The disclosures revealed an extraordinary state of affairs in  the Company. The directors were empowered to inquire into their own alleged short-comings and to report on the whole of the affairs of the Company to shareholders early in 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1911 it had been decided to sell off the business to a London company.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 22 March 1911, Page 6 -- EASTERN SMELTING CO. Sold to London. Penang, 21 Mar 10am.  The meeting of the shareholders of the Eastern Smelting Company today resolved by 29 votes to one to authorise the sale of the concern to a London Company. The Hon A. E. Adams, who presided stated that the present shareholders would get par value of their shares in sterling in the London Company, and it was proposed to sell the business of the whole Company including the assets but excluding the profits for 1910 and for the present year to date of sale.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers in July 1911 carried the prospectus of the new London-based company that was to acquire the business of the Malayan company.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 24 July 1911, Page 6 -- In our advertising columns to-day will be found the prospectus of the new company under the title of Eastern Smelting Co., Ltd., which has been registered in London to take over as a going concern the business of the Eastern Smelting Co., Ltd., Penang, with a capital of £250,000, divided into 50,000 in preferred ordinary £1 shares and £200,000 ordinary shares.&lt;/ref&gt; The chairmanship of the London-based public company was Chung Thye Phin's old friend, former British Resident, Sir Ernest Birch.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 22 August 1911, Page 8 -- EASTERN SMELTING COMPANY.

The Chairman said: the company was incorporated on 20 July this year, and the prospectus offering 50,000 Preferred Ordinary shares of £1 each was issued on 21 July, The issue was very successful, 35,736 shares being applied for in this country and 37,125 in Malaya, making 72,861 in all. Of this number 27,000 shares were allotted as to 13,870 to Malayan applicants and 13,130 to London applicants. Before the formal transfer of the business to the new company could take place, it was necessary for our auditors to prepare a balance sheet showing the vendor company's financial position at 26 July at which date the nominal transfer took place. The preparation of this balance sheet took somewhat longer than was anticipated and it was not until 2 October that the directors were enabled to complete the formal transfer of the business. The transfer has now been duly registered in the Straits Settlements and in the Federated Malay States so the new company is in full possession.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 4 January 1913, Page 3-- EASTERN SMELTING CO. Final Meeting of the Penang Company. The final meeting of The Eastern Smelting Company, Limited (in liquidation) was held at Penang, on Monday, the Hon. A. R. Adams in the chair. After the notice convening the meeting had been read. Mr. P. E. Laws, the liquidator, presented his accounts, which were regarded as very satisfactory. The accounts showed that every shareholder had been transferred to the London company, and had received shares in that company equivalent to his holding in the Penang company, and that after paying for the cost of the liquidation, there was a balance in hand of $1,287.39. The Hon A R Adams said he was sure that the shareholders in the Penang company had no cause to regret the transfer to the London company and proposed that the cash balance in hand be given to the Penang Maternity Hospital. After some discussion this was agreed to. Mr. A. F. G. Anderson moved that the provisional payment of $2,669.15 for the directors' legal costs in the action brought by Mr Robertson against the directors be confirmed. Mr Hoefeld seconded and the motion was carried.&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership by the London-company of the Penang-company became complete with the liquidation of the Penang public company.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 20 January 1912, Page 9 -- EASTERN SMELTING CO.

There were present Messrs H Jessen, L Hoefeld, Jas T Dobbie, Yeo Geok Keat, and Lee Quee Hock; several shareholders were represented by proxies.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907 he convened a public meeting held at his offices attended by leading miners and other prominent residents to discuss problems that could arise as a result of the construction of the proposed Tronoh Railway and calling for a memorandum to be sent to the government to postpone the letting of contracts until a full public enquiry could be taken.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 8 February 1907, Page 10 -- IPOH-TRONOH RAILWAY.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revenue Farmer ==
He also had vast interests in some of the Government revenue farm monopolies. On 2, July 1903, the public tenders were declared open for the running of the Kedah and Penang Opium Farms. There were eight tenders. The highest tender was made by Chung Thye Phin for the Penang farm at $260,000 a month.&lt;ref name="wuxiaoan"&gt;Chinese Business in the Making of a Malay State, 1882-1941: Kedah and Penang By Wu Xiao An, Xiao An Wu Published by Routledge, 2003; {{ISBN|0-415-30176-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-30176-3}}, Pg 111&lt;/ref&gt;

An understanding was reached that:  (i) the government cut the Penang opium farm from the $260,000 a month tendered by Chung Thye Phin to $220,000 (later reduced to $217,000), and agreed that the syndicate could have both the Penang and Kedah farms at an overall price of $260,000 per month; (ii) Gan Ngoh Bee could have half the farm, but the other half should go to Chung Thye Phin, whose tender was the highest; and (iii) the government would undertake to secure the Kedah farm on behalf of the Penang syndicate at $40,000 a month with one-to-three months' deposits.&lt;ref name="wuxiaoan"/&gt;

On 24 March 1921, His Highness Iskandar Shah K. C. M. G., the Sultan of Perak, with the advice of Colonel W. J. P. Hume, British Resident, Perak, conferred on him the title of "Kapitan China", in all probability, the last of the Chinese Kapitans in Malaya.&lt;ref&gt;The Impact of Chinese Secret Societies in Malaya: A Historical Study By Wilfred Blythe, Royal Institute of International Affairs Published by / Issued under the auspices of the Royal Institute of International Affairs [by] Oxford U.P., 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 28 February 1921, Page 12 -- CAPITAN CHINA F.

His appointment was so popular with the community that he was escorted to Kuala Kangsar by the delegates of more than 70 Chinese organisations from Perak.&lt;ref&gt;"Miscellaneous Chronicles of Penang", Kuang, Kuo-hsiang op. cit., pp. 112-113&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year he was invited to Kuala Lumpur to give his views to the Trade Depression Commission during its two day's sitting in camera.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 3 September 1921, Page 9 -- THE TRADE COMMISSION&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed trustee of the resuscitated Perak Miners' and Planters' association in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 16 May 1922, Page 10 -- MINERS AND PLANTERS.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1923 he was elected the first president of the newly inaugurated British Chinese Association.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 26 July 1923, Page 15&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1923, at the annual general meeting of the Perak Chinese Dramatic Club, he was elected Patron.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 12 November 1923, Page 15, National Library of Singapore microfilm reel NL512&lt;/ref&gt;

He presided over the Association of States and Straits Representatives (representing Chinese born in the Federated Malay States and the Straits Settlements) in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 26 July 1923, Page 15, National Library of Singapore microfilm reel NL508&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926,  together with [[Leong Sin Nam]] he was elected an honorary member of the [[Ipoh Club]], whose members till then were restricted to the European community. The [[Times of Malaya]] said this was a compliment which should further cement the good feeling existing between the European and Chinese communities in Kinta.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 15 May 1926, Page 10, National Library of Singapore microfilm reel NL542&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 15 May 1926, Page 10 -- Kapitan China Chung Thye Phin, J.P., M.S.C.. and Towkay Leong Sin Nam, J.P., M.S.C., have been elected honorary members of the Ipoh Club —a compliment, says the Times of Malaya, which should further cement the good feeling existing between the European and Chinese communities in Kinta.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the name of His Majesty the King, His Excellency the High Commissioner awarded him a Certificate of Honour in recognition of his loyal and valuable services to the government of the F. M. S. in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 4 June 1927, Page 8&lt;/ref&gt; He was presented the Malayan Certificate of Honour and its accompanying insignia by the Chief Secretary, F. M.

M. the King-Emperor's birthday the year before.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 28 August 1928, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

According to berita.perak.gov.my, Foo Yet Kai, another Perak philanthropist, bought Chung Thye Phin's villa in Ipoh from the family of the late Kapitan and later gave permission for it to be converted into a private hospital, then known as Our Lady's Hospital and run by the Franciscan Sisters from Salzkotten, Germany. The hospital subsequently was renamed Kinta Medical Centre in the  1980s when the Foo Yet Kai Foundation took over the administration.

In 1905 together with a few others, he maintained 'Seng Kee' a [[Mess]] patronized by wealthy miners and merchants including [[Foo Choo Choon]] with whom he had familial and business relations.&lt;ref&gt;Kinta Valley: pioneering Malaysia's modern development (384 pages) by	Salma Nasution Khoo and Abdur-Razzaq Lubis, Published 2005 by Perak Academy, {{ISBN|983-42113-0-9}}, {{ISBN|978-983-42113-0-1}}, Page 235&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Sportsman ==
It is known that he owned expensive cars, prize-winning horses, and even issued his own [[currency]] for use in his mines.

Motoring was one of his passions.

Chung Thye Phin was an enthusiastic sportsman and on more than one occasion won the Blue Ribbon of the Straits Turf apart from many lesser events. Among his racing trophies are one for the 1905 Singapore Derby won by one of his horses, Devilment. He was also a good billiards player.&lt;ref name="arnold"/&gt;

He was also said to be a first class billiard player and played an exhibition match with world billiard champion John Roberts at the E&amp;O Hotel in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 25 October 1953, Page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minting His Own Money ==
At one time, during the latter part of the first World War, he was among the few who were permitted by the Government to print and issue 10-cent notes for circulation. Chung Thye Phin first issued private [[banknotes]] in 10 cent denominations on 11 February 1918. These notes were only circulated within his mining concessions and the [[Kapitan Cina|Kapitan]]'s trading outlets at [[Phin Kee Chan]] in [[Ipoh]] and were used by large numbers of labourers in the mining areas in exchange for goods (Source: Museum Numismatik Maybank). No other denominations have been discovered. Circa 1918 the notes bear the legends Ten Cents "Phin Kee Chan Ten Cents" at top and bottom border and "Phin Kee Chan" at left and right border. The legend Chung Thye Phin was printed in a black panel diagonally. On the top left corner is a value of "10cents" and written in Chinese on the right is "bearer of this bill may exchange 10c from Phin Kee Chan". Embossed on it was an oval seal bearing the legend of Chung Thye Phin.&lt;ref&gt;Paper Currency of Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei (1849-1970) By William Shaw, Mohd. Kassim Haji Ali Published by Muzium Negara Malaysia, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 25 November 1974, Page 24 -- When oldtime miners ran out of coins.. IPOH Sun. -- Old-time miners and businessmen in Perak had a solution when there was an acute shortage of coins during the latter part of the World War I period. They issued their own 10 cents notes bearing their name or that of their companies, and these were accepted as legal tender. Mr. E.E. Sim, Chief Registrar of the High Court in Kuala Lumpur, and president of the Numismatic Society, Malaysia, said here today that four such 10 cents currency notes issued during 1917 and 1918 in Perak are in the National Museum. One, signed by the late Towkay Leong Sin Nam and issues in 1918, bears the name of the Perak Chamber of Commerce, two others are signed by the late Kapitan Chung Thye Phin, and the fourth is signed "Kwong Loy" on behalf of "Choy Kwong Loy" for circulation in Gopeng, Perak, only. FACE VALUE. "These notes could have been issued to overcome the shortage of subsidiary silver coins in Perak," said Mr. Sim. "It should be remembered that due to the rising price of silver in the world from early 1915, the coins in circulation in the then Federated Malay States and Straits Settlements became intrinsically worth more than the face value. A lot of silver coins in those days, issued by the Government, went to the melting pot to be sold eventually as bullion. Subsequently, the Governments here started printing notes for 10 cents and later of five cents and 25 cents as well. Many of these notes were in circulation until about 25 years ago and have since been completely withdrawn."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Held Up By Pirates On The Canton River ==
In 1897, during a trip to China, he found himself and his entourage held up by pirates. What's perhaps even more surprising is that more than a few United States newspapers carried the following story about this son of Malaya:&lt;ref&gt;''The Evening Telegram''. St. John's Newfoundland, 13 September 1897; ''Boston Evening Transcript'' - 30 August 1897; ''New York Tribune'' 31 August 1897; ''The Islander''. (Friday Harbor, San Juan County, Wash.) 1891-1899, 9 September 1897; ''The Record-Union'', Sacramento, Monday Morning, 30 August, ''The San Francisco Call'', 30 August 1897&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tacoma, Wash., August 30. -- The steamer Columbia, from Yokohama, brings Oriental advices up to July 27. News has just reached Hong Kong of the prevalence of pirates on the Canton River and one of the most daring outrages perpetrated. One of the sons of Capt. Chung Kewi, a Straits millionaire, Chung Ah Phin, was the victim. With a few of his relatives he hired a boat and they were proceeding to their native place. On the second day the boat stuck in the mud and could not proceed. During the night a gang of men with painted faces and fully armed boarded the boat. With revolvers leveled at the passengers they commanded silence, while four men began at once to look for plunder. Ah Phin brought from the Straits jewelry amounting in value to $50,000 and $20,000 in cash. These the pirates took, besides clothing, etc. They left, after threatening the victims with instant death if they made a noise till twelve hours afterwards. In the morning information was sent down to Canton, but before the authorities had time to get a gunboat up the river the pirates had made their escape."

== Architectural Memorials ==
Chung Thye Phin Building, 14 Station Road in Ipoh, Perak is a three-storey corner building from 1907. It originally housed the Medical Hall established by Dr. R.M. Connolly, the Oilfileds Dispensaries Ltd. and more recently the George Town Dispensary. Mr W. Cecil Payne, managing director of the Times of Malaya and a member of the Institute of Incorporated Accountants, had offices in Chung Thye Phin's buildings.&lt;ref name="arnold"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ipoh: The Town That Tin Built, a Review of the History, Progress and Development of Perak's Capital Published for the Ipoh Municipal Council by Phoenisc Communications, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from [[Phin Kee Chan]] (referred to by many other names, among them the Chung Thye Phin Building), he is also associated with his father's townhouse cum office in [[Penang]], [[Hye Kee Chan]], and with some other structures, like his country house on Dummond Hill in Taiping, Perak.&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society By Malaysian Branch, Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland Malaysian Branch, Singapore Published 1991, Vol. 3, pt. 2 comprises a monograph entitled: British Malaya, 1864-1867, by L.A. Mills, with appendix by C. O. Blagden, 1925. Issued also separately.&lt;/ref&gt;

His villa in the heart of Ipoh, was bought by Foo Yet Kai who later allowed its conversion, free of rent, to a private hospital, then known as Our Lady’s Hospital. It was administered by the Sisters of the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood from April 1964 to Jan 1983 but has now been taken over by The Kinta Medical Centre.&lt;ref&gt;Patriarch well known for his generosity published in The Star, 7 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chung Thye Phin Mansion at Gurney Drive on Penang island (the address at the time was No 2 Kelawai Road) with its subterranean passageways and chambers was, after his death, sold and turned into a hotel (The Shanghai Hotel) in the late 1930s but was later demolished in 1964 and on its footprint now stands an imposing condominium (1 Gurney Drive). Author Queeny Chang gives an extensive description of the place and her experience of it in her autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Page 50, Memories of a Nonya By Queeny Chang Published by Eastern Universities Press, 1981 {{ISBN|9971-71-145-1}}, {{ISBN|978-9971-71-145-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malaya: 500 Early Postcards (288 pages) by Cheah Jin Seng, Published by Editions Didier Millet, 2008, {{ISBN|981-4155-98-5}}, {{ISBN|978-981-4155-98-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time it served to house a club for German U-boatmen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=66M7_MbsTlAC&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=%22shanghai%20hotel%22%20penang&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA199#v=onepage&amp;q=%22shanghai%20hotel%22%20penang&amp;f=false Shooting the War By Otto Giese, James E.

He designed [[Relau]] Villa (also on Penang island), his holiday resort with a swimming pool ringed by private and other types of rooms. Its derelict structure can still be seen and explored at Taman Metropolitan, Relau in Penang, today. According to family history Kapitan Chung Thye Phin was inspired by the artistic canals of Venice and the enchanting ponds and lakes of China when he designed the swimming-pool, which was constructed by Mr. B. H. Ung (Ung Ban Hoe was attached to the architectural firm of Stark &amp; McNeil), the first Chinese architect who introduced reinforced concrete buildings to the community, notably the Ban Hin Lee Bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.razcollection.com/urbex/photo_relau.htm Urban exploration - Malaysia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CS Wong - Gallery  of Chinese Kapitans&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spi.com.sg/forum/viewtopic.php?t%3D12574 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420161450/http://spi.com.sg/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12574 |archivedate=20 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commentary by his grand daughter, Oola goes, "Chung Thye Phin had many residences, some of them mansions, in Penang, Ipoh and Taiping. His residence in what is now Persiaran Gurney was the most famous, with its grand entertaining rooms and undersea wing. It was built before there was a Persiaran Gurney or a Gurney Drive, and was therefore right on the shore. His largest residence in Ipoh was in a street that carried his name (and still does). This mansion now serves as a hospital. He built a summer house on a large estate near Relau and surrounded it with gardens, orchards and fish ponds. However its most striking feature was the fact that it was built around a swimming pool (the first in Penang) in the Roman tradition. This house still exists in its ruined state, now surrounded by high rise 21st century flats. There are indeed many stories to be told about Chung Thye Phin."

He also had property on Penang Hill, as was the way with the rich in those days. His was a bungalow named, simply, "Highlands".

Several articles have been published, mentioning these properties and erroneously attributing them to Thye Phin's father, Chung Keng Quee who died in 1901, well before any of these were built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/10/13/nation/19164667&amp;sec=nation Mysteries of dilapidated mansion By K.

== The Traveller ==
A widely travelled Malayan, Kapitan Chung Thye Phin had gone round the world on many a business-cum-pleasure trip. On one occasion, he undertook a perilous trip up the scenic gorges of the Yangtze River at Chungking, China, thus earning for himself the distinction of being the first non-China-born Chinese to have made the venture. It was here that he was enraptured by Nature's inimitable splendour.

== A Road In His Honour ==
In Perak he was honoured with roads named after him. Jalan Chung Thye Phin in Ipoh borders the Kinta Medical Centre. This location is appropriate - the Centre, a private hospital under the administration of the Foo Yet Kai foundation, was formerly the family mansion of Chung Thye Phin. There is another road of the same name also named in his honour in his birthplace of Taiping.

Chung Thye Phin rubbed shoulders with the rich and powerful including Sultan Iskandar Shah of Perak, a polo lover. A photograph in the National Archives shows him sitting next to the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;Group photograph, Ipoh, Perak; 1927, Seated, seventh from left to right : Raja Chulan ; Raja Muda Abdul Aziz; Capitan China Chung Thye Phin; His Highness Sultan Iskandar Shah.

In February 1907 When the Duke and the Duchess of Connaught and Princess Patricia paid an official visit to Penang in Feb. 1907, they were driven by Kapitan Chung Thye Phin in his own private car.&lt;ref&gt;Kajian Malaysia: Journal of Malaysian studies - Page 53, A gallery of Chinese kapitans - Page 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 5 February 1907, Page 6 -- THE ROYAL TOUR. DUKE OF CONNAUGHT IN PENANG. His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught visited Penang for the second time on Wednesday last. On the occasion of his first visit -- on 23 March 1890 -- his steamer was delayed and did not arrive till after sunset. The Duke was then, therefore, unable to see much of the town in the dark. However, yesterday he was more fortunate. He P. and O. Royal mail steamer Delhi, flying the Duke's flag, with Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Connaught and Princess Patricia on board, anchored near Swettenham Wharf at halfpast three o'clock in the afternoon. The Hon. [[Robert Norman Bland|R. N. Bland]], Acting Resident Councillor, accompanied by Lieut-Colonel R.F.S. Walker, Commandant Malay States Guides, and Captain H. W. D. Adams, Officer Commanding the Penang Detachment of the Malay States Guides, went on board the s.s.s Delhi to receive His Royal Highness's orders. At a quarter to four o'clock the Colonial launch Rosebud came alongside Victoria Pier. T.R.H. the Duke and Duchess of Connaught landed informally, accompanied by Princess Patricia, Miss Pelly (Lady-in-waiting), Brigadier-General Sir John Maxwell, Staff Officer, and Lieut. the Hon. M. Ponsonby, Grenadier Guards (aide-de-ca,p). Commander D.C. Macintyre, R.N.R., Harbour Master, was then introduced by Mr. Bland to the Duke and Duchess. Messrs. Chung Thye Phin, C. E. Paterson, W. H. Rose, and A. Bowers Smith kindly placed their motor cars at the disposal of the Resident Councillor and themselves acted as chauffeurs. The Suke and Duchess, with Mr. Bland and Lieut, Ponsonby, took their seats in the car of Mr. Chung Thye Phin. In the second car were Princess Patricia, Miss Pelly, Colonel Walker, and Mr. Paterson, Brigadier-General Sir john Maxwell accompanied Mr. W. H. Rose in the third car; and Captain Adam and Mr. A. Bowers Smith followed in the fourth motor-car. The route taken was along Downing Street into Beach Street, Light Street, Farquhar Street, Northam Road, Larut Road, Anson Road, Macalister Road, Barrack Road, Residency Road, and Western Road, into Waterfall Road to the Chetty Temple. The Tai-Pusum Festival now celebrated, the Temple was seen at its best. The Chetties met the Royal Party on their arrival at the Temple, where the unusual visit of His Majesty the King's brother was heralded with the sounds of many trumpets and drums. The distinguished visitors were conducted through the temple, decked with gralands, and presented with limes, etc., in accordance with the Chetties' usual method of showing their hospitality. Princess Patricia and Miss Pelly, who carried hand cameras, took numerous snapshots, the Princess photographing a group of Chetties drawn up outside the temple. On coming out of the Temple, the Duke addressed a few words to one of thee Sikh policemen in the latter's own language. The Royal party then resumed their drive and proceeded to the Waterfall Gardens, subsequently being driven to the Residency, which was reached at five o'clock, for tea. Shortly after six o'clock the Royal party returned by the same route to Victoria Pier, where the four gentlemen who had given the use of their motor cars -- Messrs. W. H. Rose, A. Bowers Smith, C.E. Paterson, and Chung Thye Phin -- were introduced to the Royal Visitors. Their Royal Highnesses thereafter went on board the Delhi at 6.30p.m., the vessel sailing for Singapore half-an-hour later. Notwithstanding the crowds of people at Victoria Pier and the Chetty Temple, excellent order was maintained by the Police, under the direction of Mr. H. O. Newland, the Chief Police Officer, who travelled to and from the Temple in another motor car. -- (Pinang Gazette).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chung, Thye Phin and Eu, Tong Sen ==
[[Eu Tong Sen]] and Chung Thye Phin were "blood" brothers. They went through Chinese ceremony to become "Keet Bye Heng Tai". When Chung Thye Phin travelled to Hong Kong, he stayed in Eu Tong Sen's villa there and they kept an account of his expenses in the company's account books. Eu Tong Sen's villa in HK was called "Eucliff". It has been torn down. It was built at Repulse Bay, HK, overlooking the sea. The property was huge. It was built with stone like a castle. It included within its walled area a tennis court and also a swimming pool.

Eu Tong Sen and Chung Thye Phin had common interests – motorcars, racehorses, country houses, etc. 1903 when the Ipoh Gymkhana Club was founded, both of them decided to enter their thoroughbreds regularly in the Ipoh races. They jointly built a weekend retreat, "Forest Lodge", at Gopeng Road with a large stable. In April 1912 Eu Tong Sen was appointed the permanent Chinese Member of the Federal Council, the seat having fallen vacant on the demise of [[Leong Fee]]. Chung Thye Phin sold his half-share to Eu Tong Sen who desired grander accommodations following the latter's elevation in status. Chung Thye Phin in turn bought Drummond’s Hill in Taiping, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|sing=on}} estate and the former Residency of Sir [[Hugh Low]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipohecho.com.my/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=59 Ipoh Echo]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, together with Chung Thye Phin he built a large Chinese theatre in the important mining town of Kampar near Ipoh.&lt;ref name="arnold"/&gt;

Chung, Thye Phin's Penang firms served as the agent for Eu, Tong Sen in Penang before he (Eu) opened a branch on the island. Eu Tong Sen's Penang branch, at least according to business directories, was the latest in his branch office network. It seemed to have opened only in  1920.

== Quotations ==
Mr. Chung Thye Phin, M.C. (owner of mines in Gopeng, Taiping, and Tronoh districts): "I do not look for any general expansion of the industry. We are now greatly troubled with our coolies, who are independent and desert freely. In view of these labour troubles, I have installed tramming services where possible, and lengthened the working day."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/malaytinfieldsmi00stokrich/malaytinfieldsmi00stokrich.pdf Malay tin-fields; mining position broadly reviewed (1906) by Stokes, Ralph S.

[[Colonel]] '''Clement Biddle''' (May 10, 1740 – July 14, 1814) was an [[American Revolutionary War]] soldier.

== Life ==
Biddle was born May 10, 1740 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] to John Biddle (1707–1789) and Sarah Owen (1711–1773).&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book | title=The twentieth century biographical dictionary of notable Americans | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_EUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT300 | publisher=The Biographical Society |author1=Brown, John Howard |author2=Johnson, Rossiter | year=1904 | isbn=1-172-21564-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the younger brother of [[Owen Biddle, Sr.]] (1737–1799).

Biddle was a part of the [[Society of Friends]] and helped organize the "Quaker Blues," a company of volunteers.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

Biddle's first marriage was to Mary Richardson on June 6, 1764.&lt;ref name="Glenn" /&gt; They had one child, Francis, who died at childbirth.&lt;ref name="Glenn" /&gt; His second marriage was to Rebekah Cornell, the daughter of Rhode Island Chief Justice [[Gideon Cornell]].&lt;ref name="Glenn"&gt;{{cite book | title=Merion in the Welsh tract: With sketches of the townships of Haverford and Radnor.

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], Biddle fought in the [[Battle of Princeton]], the [[Battle of Brandywine]], the [[Battle of Germantown]] and the [[Battle of Monmouth]]. He was the [[Commissary]] General at [[Valley Forge]] under [[George Washington]], and his headquarters was at [[Moore Hall (Phoenixville, Pennsylvania)|Moore Hall]].&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.arch.state.pa.us/| title = National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = ARCH: Pennsylvania's Historic Architecture &amp; Archaeology| format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2012-11-02}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H050890_01H.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Moore Hall| accessdate = 2012-11-03|author1=Eleanor Winsor |author2=Harvey Freedenberg | format = PDF| date= August 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biddle resigned from the Army in 1780.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; In 1781, Biddle was made quarter-master general of the Pennsylvanian troops.

After the Revolutionary War, he was the first [[U.S. Marshal]] (1789–1793) for Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="usmarshall"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usmarshals.gov/history/firstmarshals/biddle.htm | title=The First Marshal of Pennsylvania: Clement Biddle | publisher=United States Marshals Service |accessdate=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1790 census]], Biddle's jobs were "Notary, Scrivener, and Broker," which made him a rich man.&lt;ref name="usmarshall" /&gt;

==Death==
He died in Philadelphia on July 14, 1814,&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; and is buried at [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=RootsWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Biddle, Clement (Colonel )|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~stevestevens/all/25542.htm|work=RootsWeb|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1634">'''Comply or explain''' is a regulatory approach used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and other countries in the field of corporate governance and financial supervision. Rather than setting out binding laws, government regulators (in the UK, the [[Financial Reporting Council]], in Germany, under the [[Aktiengesetz]]) set out a code, which listed companies may either comply with, or if they do not comply, explain publicly why they do not. The [[UK Corporate Governance Code]], the [[German Corporate Governance Code]] (or Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 'Code Tabaksblat' ([[:nl:code-Tabaksblat]]) use this approach in setting minimum standards for companies in their [[audit]] committees, [[remuneration]] committees and recommendations for how good companies should divide authority on their boards.

The purpose of "comply or explain" is to "let the market decide" whether a set of standards is appropriate for individual companies. Since a company may deviate from the standard, this approach rejects the view that "one size fits all", but because of the requirement of disclosure of explanations to market investors, anticipates that if investors do not accept a company's explanations, then investors will sell their shares, hence creating a "market sanction", rather than a legal one. The concept was first introduced after the recommendations of the [[Cadbury Report]] of 1992.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3631">According to [[Ralph Kimball]],&lt;ref name="KimballToolkit"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Ralph |last1=Kimball |first2=Margy |last2=Ross |title=The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling (Second Edition) |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Indianapolis, IN |year=2002 |pages=50, 398 |isbn=978-0-471-20024-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[data warehouse]], a '''degenerate dimension''' is a dimension key in the [[fact table]] that does not have its own [[dimension table]], because all the interesting attributes have been placed in analytic dimensions. The term "degenerate dimension" was originated by [[Ralph Kimball]].

As Bob Becker says:{{cquote|Degenerate dimensions commonly occur when the fact table's grain is a single transaction (or transaction line). Transaction control header numbers assigned by the operational business process are typically degenerate dimensions, such as order, ticket, credit card transaction, or check numbers. These degenerate dimensions are natural keys of the "parents" of the line items.&lt;br&gt;
Even though there is no corresponding dimension table of attributes, degenerate dimensions can be quite useful for grouping together related fact tables rows. For example, retail point-of-sale transaction numbers tie all the individual items purchased together into a single market basket. In health care, degenerate dimensions can group the claims items related to a single hospital stay or episode of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Becker|first=Bob|title=Design Tip #46: Another Look At Degenerate Dimensions|date=3 June 2003|url=http://www.kimballgroup.com/2003/06/03/design-tip-46-another-look-at-degenerate-dimensions/|work=Fact Table Core Concepts|publisher=Kimball Group|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other uses of the term==
Although most writers and practitioners use the term '''degenerate dimension''' correctly, it is very easy to find misleading definitions in online and printed sources. For example, the Oracle FAQ defines a degenerate dimension as a "data dimension that is stored in the fact table rather than a separate dimension table. This eliminates the need to join to a dimension table. You can use the data in the degenerate dimension to limit or 'slice and dice' your fact table measures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degenerate dimension|url=http://orafaq.com/wiki/Degenerate_dimension|work=Oracle FAQ's|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This common interpretation implies that it is good dimensional modeling practice to place dimension attributes in the fact table, as long as you call them a degenerate dimension. This is not the case; the concept of '''degenerate dimension''' was developed by Kimball to support a specific, well-defined exception to the otherwise ironclad rule that dimension attributes are always pulled out into dimension tables.

Originally established as a joint venture between the [[Dow Chemical Company]] and [[Corning Inc.|Corning Incorporated]], it is now owned by [[DowDuPont]] and specializes in [[silicone]] and [[silicon]]-based technology, and is the largest silicone product producer in the world.&lt;ref name=jv/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Dow Corning, Bay City.jpg|thumb|right|Dow Corning, Bay City]]
Dow Corning was formally established in 1943 as a [[joint venture]] between the American conglomerates [[Dow Chemical]] and [[Corning Glass]] to explore the potential of silicone and was a manufacturer of products for use by the U.S. military in World War II. The company began operating its first plant, in Midland, MI, in 1945. Dr. E. C. Sullivan was named president, and  Dr. William R. Collings was named general manager in 1943. Dr. Collings later became president from 1954 until 1962.&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt; It expanded into Canada and Europe in 1948, and into South America and Japan in 1961.&lt;ref name= 'timeline'&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan-based Dow Corning: Timeline of a global success story|url=http://www.mlive.com/business/mid-michigan/index.ssf/2014/11/dow_corning_timeline.html|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large, majority-owned subsidiary of Dow Corning Corporation is the [[Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation]].&lt;ref name=jv&gt;{{cite news |author=Robert Westervelt |coauthors= |title=Dow Corning |url=http://www.chemweek.com/dowcorning2011/ |quote=Dow Corning, a 50–50 jv between Dow Chemical and Corning, is the world’s largest silicones producer and has a controlling 62.5% stake in Hemlock Semiconductor (Hemlock, MI), the world’s leading producer of polysilicon used in semiconductor and solar wafer production. ... |newspaper=[[Chemical Week]] |date=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=2015-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the world's largest producers of high-purity polycrystalline silicon, which is sold in varying purity grades for use in both [[semiconductor]] [[Wafer (electronics)|silicon wafer]] manufacture and [[photovoltaics]] applications as solar cells.&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt;

In 2002, the company created the Xiameter brand as an online-only distributor. As of 2011, Xiameter offers 2,100 of Dow Corning’s 7,000 products.

On November 13, 2014, Dow Chemical's CEO [[Andrew N. Liveris]] revealed in a presentation to investors that Corning Incorporated intended to exit the joint venture of 71 years, citing other priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dow Says Corning Wants to Exit 71-Year-Old Venture|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-13/dow-says-corning-wants-to-exit-71-year-old-venture.html|accessdate=16 November 2014|work=Bloomberg News|publisher=Bloomberg|first=Jack|last=Kaskey|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the December 11, 2015 announcement that it would merge with [[DuPont]], Dow also announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Corning's stake in Dow Corning in exchange for $4.8 billion in cash and Corning gaining a roughly 40% stake in Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation. Dow Chemical assumed full ownership of Dow Corning on June 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corning to Swap Stake In Dow Corning For $4.8 Billion, Semiconductor Stake|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/corning-to-sell-stake-in-dow-corning-venture-for-4-8-billion-1449846313|accessdate=11 December 2015|agency=wsj.com|publisher=wsj.com|date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg-dowdemerge&gt;{{cite news|title=Dow Chemical to Take Full Control of Dow Corning Venture|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-11/dow-chemical-takes-100-percent-stake-in-dow-corning-venture|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=Bloomberg News|agency=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
Dow Corning markets over 7000 products include various sealants, adhesives, rubbers, lubricants, silicon oils and solvents. Around 2,100 of these are available through the Dow Corning online-only distributor Xiameter, including fluids, gels, resins. The range of industries targeted by Dow Corning products spans from electronics and automotive to construction, healthcare and others.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, [[class action|class-action]] lawsuits&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/24bn-breastimplant-offer-1247358.html independent.co.uk – $2.4bn breast-implant offer], 1997-08-26&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Dow Corning's silicone [[breast implant]]s caused systemic health problems. The claims first centered on [[breast cancer]] and then migrated to a range of [[autoimmunity|autoimmune disease]]s, including [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and various neurological problems. This led to numerous lawsuits beginning in 1984 and culminating in a 1998 multibillion-dollar class action settlement.&lt;ref name = frontline&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/implants/cron.html Chronology of silicone breast implants].

The '''Edsel and Eleanor Ford House''' is a mansion located at 1100 Lake Shore Drive in [[Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan|Grosse Pointe Shores]], northeast of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]; it stands on the site known as "Gaukler Point", on the shore of [[Lake St. Clair]]. The house became the new residence of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford family in 1929. [[Edsel Ford]] was the son of [[Henry Ford]] and an executive at [[Ford Motor Company]]. The estate's buildings were designed by architect [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]], its site plan and gardens by renowned [[landscape designer]] [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]].&lt;ref name="ArchDigest"&gt;Berman Ann E. (July 2001).[http://www.architecturaldigest.com/homes/homes/archive/edsel_article_072001?currentPage=1 The Edsel &amp; Eleanor Ford House].''Architectural Digest''. Retrieved January 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The property was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979, and was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2016.

==History==

===House===
The Fords traveled to England with Albert Kahn for the concept's ideas, where they were attracted to the [[vernacular architecture]] of the [[Cotswolds]]. They asked Kahn to design a house that would resemble the closely assembled village [[cottages]] typical of that rural region. Kahn's design included [[sandstone]] exterior walls, a traditional slate roof with the stone shingles decreasing in size as they reach its peak, and moss with ivy grown across the house's exterior. Construction on the house began in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Bridenstine, James (1989). ''Edsel and Eleanor Ford House''. Wayne State University Press. Pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

While construction of the house itself took only one year, two years were spent fitting it with antique [[wood paneling]] and fireplaces brought from English [[Manor house]]s; interior fittings were in the hands of Charles Roberson, an expert in adapting old [[Europe]]an paneling and fittings to American interiors.&lt;ref&gt;Sources of interiors at Meadow Brook Farm are drawn from John Harris, ''Moving Rooms: The Trade in Architectural Salvages'' 2007:213.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallery, the largest room in the house, is paneled with sixteenth-century oak [[linenfold]] [[relief carving|relief carved]] [[wood panelling]]. Its hooded [[Fireplace mantel|chimneypiece]] is from [[Wollaston, West Midlands|Wollaston Hall in Worcestershire]], England; the timber-framed house had been demolished in 1925 and its dismantled elements and fittings were in the process of being dispersed. Fourteenth century [[stained-glass]] window medallions were added to the house in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Bridenstine, Pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Roberson's barrel-vaulted ceiling for the Gallery was modeled on one at Boughton Malherbe, [[Kent]], England. Paneling and doors in the Dining Room, entirely devoid of electricity, came from 'New Place', a victim of early twentieth-century expansion in [[Upminster]], a new suburb of [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2007 documents the source in a Roberson brochure, p 213 and figs. 225-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Library's paneling and its stone chimneypiece came from the Brudenell seat, Deene Park, [[Northamptonshire]], England. Harris suggests that this already once removed paneling had come from another 'Brudenell seat.'
The Study has a wooden [[overmantel]] with the date 1585, from Heronden Hall, in [[Tenterden]], [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other interesting design elements include kitchen counters made of [[sterling silver]], a "secret" photographic [[darkroom]] behind a panel of Edsel Ford's office, and [[Art Deco]] style rooms designed by [[Walter Dorwin Teague]], a leading [[industrial design]]er of the 1930s. Teague's first floor "Modern Room" features 'the new' indirect lighting method, taupe colored leather wall panels, and a curved niche with eighteen vertical mirrored sections.&lt;ref&gt;Bridenstine, Pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt; He also designed bedrooms and sitting rooms for all three of Edsel and Eleanor's sons. Teague's design for son [[Henry Ford II]]’s bathroom includes grey glass walls made of the same structural glass as its shower stall.&lt;ref&gt;Bridenstine, Pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Furnishings===
The house featured an extensive [[art collection]], reflecting Edsel and Eleanor's status as serious museum [[benefactor (law)|benefactors]]. After Eleanor Ford's death, many important paintings were donated to the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] (DIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.org/ |title=Detroit Institute of Arts Museum |publisher=Dia.org |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductions were hung in their place. The classical [[Louis XVI of France|French-style]] Drawing Room features two original [[Paul Cézanne]] paintings and reproductions of [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Edgar Degas]] works.&lt;ref&gt;Bridenstine, Pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; A reproduction of  [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s ''The Postman Roulin'' hangs in the Morning Room.&lt;ref&gt;Bridenstine, Pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt; An original [[Diego Rivera]] painting, ''Cactus on the Plains'', hangs in the Modern Room.&lt;ref&gt;Bridenstein, Pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gardens===
[[File:EdselFordHouseGardens.jpg|thumb|Gardens near the pool]]
The [[estate (house)|estate's]] gardens were designed by [[landscape architect]] [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]] with his traditional 'long view,' giving visitors a glimpse of the residence down the long [[meadow]] after the passing the entry gates, then brief partial views along the long drive, and only at the end revealing the entire house and another view back up the long meadow.&lt;ref&gt;Grese, Robert E., ''Jens Jensen, Maker of Natural Parks and Gardens''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-8018-4287-5}}. pp. 102, 152, 157-58, 180, 160, 162-63, 174, 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Ford wanted to have a [[rose garden]] installed but Jensen originally disapproved of this claiming that it would ruin the landscape which was designed to look completely natural. Jensen had previously quit on [[Henry Ford]] and [[Clara Ford]], when Clara wanted to install a rose garden directly in the center of the backyard meadow at the [[Fair Lane|Henry Ford Estate]]. Eleanor and Jensen eventually came to a compromise and the rose garden was placed behind some native bushes which was out of sight of the meadow that is the focal piece of the front lawn. Jensen's son was contracted later on to install the new garden area which has a [[reflecting pool]] and does not have the natural stylizing of the rest of the grounds. Instead he opted for finely trimmed bushes and square grassy areas.

The grounds of the [[estate (land)|estate]] include a power house and a gate house along affluent Lake Shore Drive, often mistaken for the actual house. The gate house includes apartments formerly used by staff and an eight-car garage with a [[Turntablism|turntable]] to rotate cars so they don’t need to back out.&lt;ref name="Bridenstine, Pg. 81"&gt;Bridenstine, Pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The Recreation House beyond the man-made [[lagoon]] and [[swimming pool]] contains changing rooms and a [[Squash (sport)|squash court]] with spectator's gallery.&lt;ref name="Bridenstine, Pg. 81"/&gt; Closer to the gate house is Josephine Ford's child-sized [[Wendy house|playhouse]], built for her by her grandmother Clara (Mrs. [[Henry Ford]]), in 1930. It features working electricity and plumbing and an exterior decorated with characters from nursery rhymes.&lt;ref&gt;Bridenstine, Pgs. 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;

For William on his 21st birthday the family enlisted a company which built a full size replica pirate ship on the lagoon as a party showpiece. The party was held outside just off the Apple Patio and featured live acts including [[Frank Sinatra]].

==Museum==
[[Edsel Ford]] died in this house in 1943 and his wife Eleanor Ford lived there until her death in 1976. It was her wish that the property be used for "the benefit of the public". The [http://www.fordhouse.org Edsel &amp; Eleanor Ford House] is open to the public for guided tours. Located on {{convert|87|acre|m2}} at 1100 Lake Shore Road in Grosse Pointe Shores, the {{convert|20000|sqft|m2|0|adj=on}} house has a fine collection of original antiques and art, and beautiful lakefront grounds. The grounds include the frontage on Ford's Cove, the total Lake St. Clair waterfront of the property is 3,100&amp;nbsp;feet (985 m). The house currently hosts special events, classes and lectures. The estate is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/OpaAPI/media/25339988/content/electronic-records/rg-079/NPS_MI/79001164.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Edsel &amp; Elanor Ford House (includes amendments)|author=Rochelle S.

Several restoration projects have been started in recent years, most of which were to fix the deteriorating masonry on the main house, the play house, and the various walks. The Edsel Ford house relies on donations as well as an original trust set up by Mrs. Ford to continue restoration work. Mrs. Ford left a total of $15,000,000 USD when she handed the house over in trust in the 1970s. In 2007 the fund reached a value of $98,000,000 USD.

The house has undergone multiple large scale restoration projects, including new roofing which was conducted by a firm from [[England]] using five professional masons. The roof was torn down to the base wood all of which was replaced where needed. The stone was selected to match the existing stone from the same quarry as the original.

The restoration projects are done by skilled craftsmen who have had proven previous experience in their fields. The foundation selects bidders for projects based on their previous experience, portfolio and firms that can provide near original/original material over pricing to ensure that the estate is restored to the original construction specifications.

The most recent restoration project was to replace the [[sandstone]] pillars on the outside of the lakefront [[patio]], which had started to crack around the upper edges. To ensure complete historical accuracy the foundation contracted a firm from the same region from where the original stone was purchased.

There are still many rooms where visitors are not permitted, including the basement. While the estate houses 60-plus rooms as well as other buildings, the public tours usually only showcase 20 of them. Occasionally the other rooms, such as staff living quarters, are showcased in specific tours. Though a number of rooms in the north upstairs wing of the house hold administrative offices, these are not shown to the public. Some of the rooms are still in less than desirable condition, and restoration projects hope to have the entire estate in show-worthy condition within the next few years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10103">'''Education policy''' consists of the principles and government policies in the educational sphere as well as the collection of laws and rules that govern the operation of [[education]] systems.

Or simply we can say that An Education Policy is a past or up to date statement or series of statements which explain, recommend or exclude a course of action or actions to be taken to run the system of education. These statements are usually written, but they could be oral. 

Education occurs in many forms for many purposes through many institutions.  Examples include [[early childhood education]], [[kindergarten]] through to 12th grade, two and four year colleges or universities, graduate and professional education, adult education and job training. Therefore, education policy can directly affect the education people engage in at all ages.

Examples of areas subject to debate in education policy, specifically from the field of schools, include school size, class size, school choice, school [[privatization]], tracking, teacher selection, education and certification, teacher pay, teaching methods, curricular content, graduation requirements, school infrastructure investment, and the values that schools are expected to uphold and model.

Issues in education policy also address problems within higher education. The Pell Institute analyzes the barriers experienced by teachers and students within community colleges and universities. These issues involve undocumented students, sex education, and federal grant aides.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with eating disorders (2nd ed). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Education policy analysis is the scholarly study of education policy.  It seeks to answer questions about the purpose of education, the objectives (societal and personal) that it is designed to attain, the methods for attaining them and the tools for measuring their success or failure. Research intended to inform education policy is carried out in a wide variety of institutions and in many academic disciplines.  Important researchers are affiliated with departments of [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], and [[Developmental psychology|human development]], in addition to schools and departments of education or public policy.  Examples of education policy analysis may be found in such [[academic journal]]s as ''[[Education Policy Analysis Archives]]'' and in university policy centers such as the [[National Education Policy Center]] housed at the University of Colorado Boulder [[University of Colorado Boulder]].

== Education reform in the United States ==

[[Education reform]] is a topic that is in the mainstream currently in the United States.  Over the past 30 years, policy makers have made a steady increase at the state and federal levels of government in their involvement of US schools.  US states spend most of their budgets funding schools, whereas only a small portion of the federal budget is allocated to education.&lt;ref&gt;Coggins, C. (2017). ''How to be heard: 10 lessons teachers need to advocate for their students and profession''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Although states hold the constitutional right on education policy, the federal government is advancing their role by building on state and local education policies.&lt;ref name="eds.a.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=4c281704-1acd-4d75-a285-cc3161b5fac8%2540sessionmgr4005&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4208|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the state of Texas during the 84th Legislature, there were several education reform bills filed and sponsored by many education reform groups, such as Texans for Education Reform.  Lawmakers want to create more involvement at the local level, and more transparency in our public schools.  These groups are being pressured and opposed by teachers' unions saying that accountability and transparency policies are targeting educators, and that they are trying to hold them responsible for the education system.&lt;ref name="eds.a.ebscohost.com"/&gt;

== Teacher policy ==
Teacher policy is education policy that addresses the preparation, recruitment, and retention of teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/strengthening-education-systems/quality-framework/technical-notes/teacher-policies/|title=Teacher policies: Preparation, Recruitment and Retention of Quality Teachers/Educators|last=UNESCO|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher policy is guided by the same overall vision and essential characteristics as the wider education policy: it should be strategic, holistic, feasible, sustainable, and context-sensitive. Overall objectives and major challenges to be addressed, the funding to achieve these objectives, the demographic parameters of the learner population and the human resources required to achieve universally accessible quality education should all be addressed in a comprehensive teacher policy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002352/235272e.pdf|title=Teacher policy development guide: summary|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=14, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nine key dimensions ===
Nine key dimensions are considered crucial to any comprehensive teacher policy: Teacher Recruitment and Retention, Teacher education (initial and continuing), Deployment, Career Structures/Paths, Teacher Employment and Working Conditions, Teach Reward and Remuneration, Teacher Standards, Teacher Accountability, and School Governance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Teacher Recruitment and Retention ====
An effective education system must have a way to attract and retain outstanding educators. There has been a growing demand for teachers but the supply continues to diminish and many of them leave their profession&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/11/27/why-its-a-big-problem-that-so-many-teachers-quit-and-what-to-do-about-it/|title=Analysis {{!}} Why it’s a big problem that so many teachers quit — and what to do about it|last=Strauss|first=Valerie|date=2017-11-27|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A reasonable strategy in talent management for the education sector must focus on recruitment, development, and retention of intelligent and efficient teachers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/topschooljobs/k-12_talent_manager/2015/02/balanced_recruitment_retention.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-FB|title=7 Steps for a Balanced Recruitment AND Retention Strategy|last=Douglas|first=Emily|website=Education Week - K-12 Talent Manager|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==== Teacher Education (Initial and Continuing) ====
Teachers need to go back to school periodically to become better educators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.goethe.de/en/spr/mag/21047328.html|title=“Continuing education must be in-depth”|work=@GI_weltweit|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Good mentors can become outstanding by going further than textbooks. This is the logic behind continuing education. Technology in the form of web-based workshops and lectures will be helpful&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://evolllution.com/opinions/the-value-of-workshops-and-continuing-education-for-teachers/|title=The Value of Workshops and Continuing Education for Teachers|date=2012-08-10|work=The EvoLLLution|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. School administrators and district officials must push their teachers to make use of available resources and opportunities to continue the learning process. Conferences with workshops are also valuable because these activities provide teachers with tools for integration of technology in the classrooms and Continuing Professional Development Units in boosting their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/stkerr/conted.html|title=Teachers' Continuing Professional Development at the University of Washington|website=faculty.washington.edu|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Marinakis received the [[Lloyd's List|Lloyd’s List]] "Greek Shipping Personality of the Year" Award at a special ceremony in Athens. Nigel Lowry of Lloyd’s List said Marinakis was the "outstanding candidate" for the award and noted his $1 billion investment in fleet capacity in 2017, his "dynamic dealmaking" in the shipping sector, as well as a range of other activities across philanthropy, sports and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-owner-evangelos-marinakis-844573|title=Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis the 'outstanding candidate' for special award|last=|first=|date=28 November 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political career ===
In May 2014, Marinakis was elected first member of the Piraeus city council with the ''Piraeus Winner'' independent ticket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pireasnet.gr/%CE%9C%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%99%CE%9D%CE%91%CE%9A%CE%97%CE%A3%CE%95%CE%A5%CE%91%CE%93%CE%93%CE%95%CE%9B%CE%9F%CE%A3MARINAKISEVANGELOS/tabid/1400/Default.aspx|title=LOCAL COUNCILLOR - EVANGELOS M. MARINAKIS|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=MUNICIPALITY OF PIRAEUS OFFICIAL WEBSITE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he co-founded with [[Yannis Moralis (politician)|Yannis Moralis]], vice-president of [[Olympiacos F.C.]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/23/greece-vote-port-idUSL6N0O53BD20140523|title = Shipping tycoon makes rare political foray in Greek port town|date = 23 May 2014|accessdate = |website = Reuters|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among their pledges were the preservation of the public nature of [[Piraeus]] Port Authority and the development of Piraeus as Europe’s largest cruise ship destination and home port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moralis : "Our problem is that shipowners left from Piraeus"|url=http://en.protothema.gr/moralis-our-problem-is-that-shipowners-left-from-piraeus/|accessdate=23 June 2015|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the elections, his political opponent, Vassilis Michaloliakos, claimed Marinakis was related with the far right political party [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] and accused him for its financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden Dawn’s consolidation and its reluctant prosecution|url=http://roarmag.org/2015/02/greece-golden-dawn-prosecution/|publisher=roarmag.org|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marinakis rejected these accusations stating "I condemn Golden Dawn's criminal activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piraeus mayor accuses opponent of deal with Golden Dawn|url=http://www.enetenglish.gr/?i=news.en.article&amp;id=1951|publisher=enetenglish.gr|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the election, ''[[Reuters]]'' declared that "rarely has big business mingled so openly with politics in a country where contacts between the two are usually conducted behind the scenes".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Marinakis responded, in a [[TradeWinds (newspaper)|Tradewinds]] interview, that he can see no reason why someone with a strong record in business cannot get into politics, "calling that stance "Palaiolithic logic". "I am not afraid to be involved in politics, because I have no business with the Greek state" he said. Since the elections, he undertook the construction of squares, parks, children’s playgrounds and sports facilities, at his own cost, as the municipality of Piraeus lacks the necessary funds due to the economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tradewindsnews.com/TWplus/355684/marinakis-the-man-behind-the-legend|title=Marinakis. The man behind The Legend|last=|first=|date=13 March 2015|work=|newspaper=Tradewinds|access-date=|via=|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
Since mid-2010 Marinakis has owned [[Piraeus]]' hometown team [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], and serves as its President.&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://www.olympiacos.org/en/member/1634/evangelos-marinakis][[Olympiacos]]&lt;span&gt; website official biography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Marinakis served as president of the [[Superleague Greece]] and vice-president of the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] (HFF) from August 2010 until September 2011. During his presidency of Olympiacos, the team won the Greek League title for seven consecutive seasons from 2010–11 to 2016–17, and the National Cup for the 2011–12, 2012–13 and 2014–15 seasons.

In May 2017, it was announced that Marinakis had completed a transaction to become the majority shareholder in English Championship club and former double European Cup winners [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/nottingham-forest-football-club-press-release-3719464.aspx|title=Nottingham Forest Football Club have released the following statement regarding the take-over by Mr Evangelos M. Marinakis|last=NFFC|access-date=18 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Nottingham Post]]'' noted that Marinakis’ acquisition of the club heralds “an exciting future that gives genuine reason for optimism”. Meanwhile, manager [[Mark Warburton]] commented that he expects Marinakis and his team to be ambitious for Nottingham Forest. “..they are aware of the club's stature and they are good football people,” Warburton was quoted as saying. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/nottingham-forest-talking-point-fine-lines-mean-so-much-as-evangelos-marinakis-plans-new-era/story-30335904-detail/story.html|title=Fine lines mean so much as Evangelos Marinakis plans new era|date=17 May 2017|work=Nottingham Post|access-date=18 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forest.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=581453#ixzz4hQRYlus0|title=Warburton Expecting Aggressive Marinakis Ambitions {{!}} VitalFootball.co.uk|last=Ltd|first=Vitalnetwork|work=VitalFootball.co.uk|access-date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media ===
In September 2016, Marinakis, through his company Alter Ego Media S.A., won one of four national television licenses auctioned in Greece after spending EUR 73.9m ($82.8m) in a highly unusual competitive bidding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradewindsnews.com/incoming/775802/marinakis-wins-greek-tv-licence|title=Marinakis wins Greek TV licence|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Tradewinds News|access-date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The license was however revoked on 26 October 2016 since the [[Council of State (Greece)| Greek Council of State]] held that the TV license law of [[Minister of State]] [[Nikos Pappas (politician)|Nikos Pappas]] was unconstitutional.

In July 2017, Alter Ego was confirmed by a Greek first-instance court as the acquirer of the [[Lambrakis Press Group]] (DOL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/07/25/greek-court-confirms-transfer-of-lambrakis-media-group-to-vangelis-marinakis/|title=Greek Court Confirms Transfer of Lambrakis Media Group to Vangelis Marinakis - GreekReporter.com|author=|date=|website=greece.greekreporter.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court approval for the transfer ownership of DOL to Alter Ego followed the latter’s success as the highest bidder in an auction process held earlier in 2017. The court ratified the sale and granted a request by DOL staff that the auction procedure be accepted as valid. The completion of the transfer of ownership was also supported by trade unions representing DOL staff. DOL is one of Greece’s historic major media groups and includes the top selling [[Ta Nea]] and [[To Vima]] newspapers, two of the country's oldest dailies, as well as a popular news portal, magazines and radio station. As of March 2018 the agreement for DOL has not yet been approved by the Competition Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyprusnews.eu/tvxs-epistimi/7297995-%CE%B5%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%BC%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%B2%CE%AF%CE%B2%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B4%CE%BF%CE%BB-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD-%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B7.html|title=Εμπλοκή στη μεταβίβαση του ΔΟΛ στον Μαρινάκη|first=|last=Administrator|date=|website=cyprusnews.eu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds a 22% stake in [[Mega Channel]] TV station. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-07/25/c_136469236.htm|title=Greek shipowner Marinakis acquires media group DOL - Xinhua - English.news.cn|author=|date=|website=news.xinhuanet.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
===Sports===
On 21 February 2011, Olympiacos beat Panathinaikos in [[Karaiskaki Stadium]] (2–1), after a controversial, regarding the referee's decisions, game. After the game, player [[Djibril Cissé]] had a wrangle with Olympiacos' president Marinakis. He was beaten by Olympiakos' fans and stated that he was going to appeal to the [[UEFA]]. The case of Cissé and Marinakis went to the Greek courts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdna.gr/podosfairo/superleague/article/244622/sto-edolio-o-marinakis-gia-epeisodio-me-sise Στο δικαστήριο Σισέ-Μαρινάκης]&lt;/ref&gt; where Marinakis was found innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/omades/Olympiakos/athwos-o-marinakhs-sth-dikh-me-ton-sise.4596324.html|title=Αθώος ο Μαρινάκης στη δίκη με τον Σισέ|last=|first=|date=27 March 2017|website=Sport24.gr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug trafficking===
In March 2018, Marinakis was charged with trafficking heroin by [[prosecutor|public prosecutor]] Irene Tziva. The accusations against Marinakis were described as "very serious charges" following a three-year investigation after the tanker Noor One was intercepted at the Greek port of [[Piraeus]] carrying 2.1 tonnes of heroin in 2014. He has also been charged with financing an illegal operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43527262|title=Evangelos Marinakis: Nottingham Forest owner rejects drugs link|author=|date=24 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nottingham Forest F.C. chairman Nicholas Randall wrote an open letter to supporters reaffirming his support for Evangelos Marinakis. Randall confirmed the matter was under investigation but that "there is no ‘charge’ against Marinakis and no ‘prosecution’ is in process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No drug charge for Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/no-drug-charge-for-forest-owner-evangelos-marinakis-gmw2fk6l0|website=The Times|accessdate=18 May 2018|date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The GAO Journal''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[magazine]] published during the late 20th century that succeeded ''[[GAO Review|The GAO Review]]''.  It was published by the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the [[United States Congress]].  It began in 1988 and ceased publication in 1992.

The purpose of the ''Journal'' was to cover government and defense auditing topics and document the activities of the GAO.  Whereas the ''Review'' had primarily been an internal publication the intent of the ''Journal'' was to speak more in the direction of an outside audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''George Mathews''' ({{OldStyleDateDY|August 30, |1739|August 19, 1739}}&amp;nbsp;– {{nowrap|August 30, 1812}}) was a [[Continental Army]] officer during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and rose to the rank of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] brigadier general; he was [[Governors of Georgia|Governor of Georgia]], and a [[U.S. Congressman]]. He was the leading participant in the [[Patriot War (Seminole Wars)|Patriot War]] of East Florida, an 1810–1812 [[filibuster (military)|filibuster]] expedition to capture [[Spanish Florida]] for the United States.

Born in [[Augusta County]], [[Virginia]], Mathews was in early life a merchant and planter. He quickly became a senior officer in the colonial forces, and was credited along with Colonel [[Andrew Lewis (soldier)|Andrew Lewis]] for the victory of the Virginia provincial militia against the [[Shawnee]] and [[Mingo Indian]] tribes in the [[Battle of Point Pleasant]] of [[Dunmore's War]]. He was afterward a member of the [[Virginia House of Burgesses|House of Burgesses]] from Augusta County. He attended the [[First Virginia Convention]] when the [[Virginia General Assembly]] was dissolved by [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|royal governor]] [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]].

On the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] Mathews led the [[9th Virginia Regiment]] of the [[Continental Army]] to the [[Battle of Brandywine]] in September 1777. He and his entire regiment were captured in the [[Battle of Germantown]] the following month. He spent the next four years as a [[prisoner of war]], including two years on the British [[prison ship]] {{HMS|Jersey}}.  He was exchanged on December 5, 1781.  He was breveted to the rank of brigadier general on September 30, 1783.  He was an original member of the Virginia [[Society of the Cincinnati]].

After the war, he moved to the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and was quickly elected to the [[Georgia General Assembly]]. The same year he was elected 20th [[Governors of Georgia|governor]] of the state. He served two terms as governor, and one intermittent term in [[United States Congress|Congress]], during which he voted to [[Ratification of the United States Constitution|ratify the United States Constitution]]. During his second administration he quietly allowed the creation of the rogue state of the [[Trans-Oconee Republic]], headed by General [[Elijah Clarke]]. He oversaw the removal of the state when public opinion, coupled with pressure from the Federal government, shifted. His administration was later tainted by the [[Yazoo Land Fraud]], which ultimately led to his retirement from politics.

Mathews relocated to the [[Mississippi Territory]] and in 1810 was assigned a [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] operation by President [[James Madison]] to incite an insurrection in [[East Florida]] and capture the territory for the United States. This initiative is now referred to as the [[Patriot War (Seminole Wars)|Patriot War]] of East Florida. Mathews had launched the insurrection, capturing [[Fernandina Beach, Florida|Ferninanda Beach]] and [[Amelia Island]], before the secret mission was recalled and disowned by President Madison, fearing war with Spain and its allies. On learning of the recall, Mathews set out to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to confront Madison on the decision. He died in [[Augusta, Georgia]] on his way to the capital. He is buried at [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Augusta, Georgia)|St. Paul's Episcopal Church]].

== Early life ==

George Mathews was born on August 30, 1739 in [[Augusta County, Virginia]] to Anne (née Archer) and John Mathews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herndon|first1=G.

By the 1760s George and a brother, [[Sampson Mathews]] had acquired extensive property along the western frontier as far west as the [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia|Greenbrier district]], and set up several outpost along this stretch. They sold both frontier necessities and specialty goods and their imports included Atlantic trade markets.&lt;ref name=Handley&gt;Handley, Harry E. (1963), "The Mathews Trading Post", published in The Journal of the Greenbrier Historical Society: Volume 1, Number 1 (Lewisburg, West Virginia: Greenbrier Historical Society, August 1963) http://www.gillilandtrails.org/pages/MathewsTradingPost.asp Retrieved October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was active in civic affairs of his community, holding the offices of [[Sheriffdom|sheriff]], [[vestryman]], and [[justice of the peace]] for Augusta County,&lt;ref name=Patrick/&gt; and he was regularly involved in skirmishes against local Native American tribes, who frequently conducted raids into the colonies.

In the fall of 1774, Royal Governor [[Lord Dunmore]] assembled an invasion of Native American Virginia territory as a result of the rising tension between the two peoples, culling a thousand troops largely from the Virginia frontier. George Mathews was commissioned captain of Augusta County militia under Colonel [[Andrew Lewis (soldier)|Andrew Lewis]], whom he accompanied to [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia|Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia)]]. The October 1774 [[Battle of Point Pleasant]] of [[Dunmore's War]] was fought between Virginia militia and Native Americans from the [[Shawnee]] and [[Mingo]] tribes along the [[Ohio River]]. The Native Americans, under the Shawnee Chief [[Cornstalk]], attacked Virginia militia under Col. Lewis, attempting to halt Lewis's advance into the [[Ohio Country]].&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, George W., ''History of Kanawha County: from its organization in 1789 until the present time''; Printed at the Office of the West Virginia Journal, 1876, 345 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt; Rembert Patrick described the battle as "a typical Indian battle where every man found a tree, and military discipline in the English sense was unknown."&lt;ref name=Patrick /&gt; Mathews was credited with a flanking maneuver late in the battle that initiated Cornstalk's retreat.&lt;ref name= Herndon&gt;Herndon, G.

== American Revolutionary War ==
[[File:Germantown.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|American forces lay siege during the [[Battle of Germantown]]]]
George Mathews was commissioned colonel of the [[9th Virginia Regiment]] in the [[Continental Army]] on the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and led the regiment north to join the General [[George Washington]] and the [[Continental Army]] for the [[Battle of Brandywine]] of the [[Philadelphia campaign]]. The battle, fought between Washington's army and the British army of General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] on September 11, 1777, consisted primarily of hand-to-hand bayonet combat. The British defeated the Americans and forced them to withdraw toward the rebel capital of [[Philadelphia]]. Mathews was credited for saving the American army from rout at the battle, during which he was said to have been stabbed 5–7 times.&lt;ref name=Patrick/&gt; [[Alexander Scott Withers]] declared him the "hero of Brandywine."&lt;ref name= Herndon/&gt; The following month, he and his entire regiment were killed, captured, or scattered at the [[Battle of Germantown]], a second clash between generals Washington and Howe. Mathews led a charge early in the day that resulted in the capture up to 100 British soldiers; however, as the day progressed, his regiment had penetrated so deeply into British lines that it became isolated from Washington's army and was engulfed by opposing troops.&lt;ref name=Patrick/&gt; The given reasons for his capture vary; some claim he did not receive Washington's orders to retreat, while others claim his regiment became lost in the fog and smoke of battle.&lt;ref name= Herndon/&gt; He spent much of the remaining revolution as a [[American Revolution prisoners of war|prisoner of war]], at first held at [[Philadelphia]]. When the British withdrew from there, he was moved to the [[prison ship]] {{HMS|Jersey|1736|6}}, anchored in [[New York harbor]].&lt;ref name=Patrick/&gt;&lt;ref name= Herndon/&gt;

[[File:Interior HMS Jersey 1855.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|Interior of {{HMS|Jersey|1736|6}}]]
By 1779 he was granted a limited ''[[parole]]'' and permitted to live in New York City. He wrote to Governor [[Thomas Jefferson]] and to the [[Continental Congress]] urging a [[prisoner exchange]]. Jefferson wrote to Mathews to explain his decision to leave him in New York City as a parolee and instead exchange for others still suffering on the prison ships:

}}

He was finally exchanged on December 5, 1781, at which point he went south with Major General [[Nathanael Greene|Nathaniel Greene]], campaigning in [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and fighting with Greene at the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]].&lt;ref name=Herndon/&gt; He was named commander of the [[12th Virginia Regiment]], but this was only a nominal command, since his new regiment had been prisoners since the fall of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] in May 1780.  He was brevetted to the rank of brigadier general on September 30, 1781.

== Political career in Georgia==
Mathews was impressed with the opportunities for political and financial gain on the Georgia frontier during his campaign with Gen. Greene. When he was released from service in 1783, he bought land in [[Wilkes County, Georgia|Wilkes County]], augmenting that with [[land grant]]s given for Revolutionary War service. He liquidated his Virginia property, and moved his family to a [[log cabin]] there. He and his wife, Polly, would raise their children there and in their later, larger house. In all, they had eight: John, Charles Lewis, [[George Mathews (judge)|George]], William, Ann, Jane, Margaret, and Rebecca.

[[File:ElijahClarkeByRembrandtPeale.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|General [[Elijah Clarke]] organized the [[Trans-Oconee Republic]] in 1794]]
He became a judge in Wilkes County, and a town commissioner for [[Washington, Georgia]]. In 1787 he was a successful candidate for the [[Georgia General Assembly|Georgia Assembly]].

His bearing and military experience gained the respect of the other members, and they named him 20th [[Governor of Georgia|Governor]] of Georgia in 1787. Following his term in the governor's office he was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1789 for one term, during which he attended the state convention to ratify the [[United States Constitution]]. His identification as a [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]] and his involvement in [[land speculation]] caused him to lose the election for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1792. But, by 1793 he had regained enough support to again be chosen governor.

His second administration was more tumultuous than his first. In February 1794, General [[Elijah Clarke]], a popular veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War]], lead an expedition to establish an independent state west of the [[Oconee River]]—on hunting grounds reserved by the federal [[Treaty of New York (1790)]] exclusively for the [[Creek Indians]]. Georgia had not been consulted on the original treaty and many Georgians viewed it unfavorably because they saw it as limiting the possibilities for the future expansion of their state.&lt;ref name=Lamplugh&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pbbiqe9o0lEC&amp;dq=The+Georgia-Florida+Frontier,+1793-1796:+Spanish+Reaction+to+French+Intrigue+and+American+Designs&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s George R. Lamplugh, ''Politics on the Periphery: Factions and Parties in Georgia, 1783-1806''], Newark, University of Delaware Press, 1986, pp. 64-68, accessed 19 Nov 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke's [[frontier]]smen made settlements on lands in present-day [[Greene County, Georgia|Greene]], [[Morgan County, Georgia|Morgan]], [[Putnam County, Georgia|Putnam]], and [[Baldwin County, Georgia|Baldwin]] counties of Georgia.  The settlers built several towns and forts over the next few months. They also wrote and ratified their own constitution, indicating the permanent intention of their endeavor.  With little overt opposition from the Creek, they were taking control of the lands before the state or federal governments could react.&lt;ref name=NGE&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2532 Christopher J. Floyd, "Trans-Oconee Republic"], ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'', 2004–2010, accessed 19 Nov 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States government viewed Clarke's actions as a violation of the Treaty of New York, which provided recognition of Creek lands in an effort to maintain peace and guarantee their neutrality.  President [[George Washington]] pressured Mathews to remove the illegal settlers from the Creek lands.  Mathews initially ignored the "unauthorized military expedition", because he shared the state's resentment of the treaty&lt;ref name=Lamplugh/&gt; and was aware of Clarke's popularity as a hero of the Revolution. He took only token measures to stop Clarke and his party, such as issuing a proclamation in July 1794 that went unenforced.  It is unlikely that Mathews had enough public support to move against Clarke at that juncture, but the tide of public opinion eventually changed and he took actions to remove the rogue general from power.&lt;ref name="NGE"/&gt; In September, 1200 Georgia militiamen, acting in conjunction with federal troops stationed on the Oconee, surrounded and isolated General Clarke's fortifications.  After some negotiation, Clarke agreed to surrender, provided that he and his men would not face prosecution for their actions. Clarke and his followers departed, and the militia burned down the new settlements and fortifications.&lt;ref name=NGE/&gt;

[[Image:Yazoo-Georgia Controversy.png|thumb|upright=1.0|The three areas that constituted the 1789 [[Yazoo land scandal]]. The fraud led to Mathews' political downfall.]]
Mathews' popularity waned, in 1794 he turned to [[land speculation]] in an effort to maintain his popularity. He, along with other high-ranking Georgia officials, issued several grants of land for the same parcels, at times granting up to three times more land than existed. Four new companies: the Georgia Company, the Georgia-Mississippi Company, the Upper Mississippi Company, and the new Tennessee Company, persuaded the Georgia state assembly to sell more than 40,000,000 acres (160,000 km2) of land for $500,000. Many Georgia officials and legislators were to be stockholders in these companies. On January 7, 1795, Mathews signed into law a bill authorizing the sale of the 40,000,000 acres (160,000 km2), known as the Yazoo Act.

When the details were revealed, public outrage was widespread, and people protested to federal officials and Congressmen. [[Jared Irwin]] and U.S. Senator [[James Jackson (Georgia politician)|James Jackson]] led the reform efforts: Irwin was elected Governor of Georgia and, less than two months after taking office, signed a bill on February 13, 1796 nullifying the Yazoo Act. The state burned all copies of the bill except for one that had been sent to President George Washington. Jackson resigned as Senator to run for office as next Governor of Georgia. He was elected and took office two years later.&lt;ref name=Magrath&gt;Magrath, C. Peter. (1966)''Yazoo: Law and Politics in the New Republic. The Case of 'Fletcher v. Peck'.'' (1966). Providence, R.I.: Brown University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathews started afresh in the [[Mississippi Territory]]. His wife Polly had died, so he married a widow, Mary (Fairchild) (Lewis) Carpenter (widow of Richard Carpenter, 1729–1788.&lt;ref&gt;Terry L. Carpenter: "Richard Carpenter, Pioneer Merchant of British West Florida and the Natchez District of Spanish West Florida", in ''The National Genealogical Society Quarterly'', Vol. 72, No. 1, March 1984, pp. 51-62.&lt;/ref&gt;), who owned property there. He again returned to land speculation, buying stock in a land company the claimant of extensive acreage in the territory. A few years later he would also return to politics.

In 1798 he was appointed governor of the newly formed territory of Mississippi by President [[John Adams]]. [[Secretary of War]] [[James McHenry]] objected to the appointment, citing Mathews' financial stake in the territory. When Adams withdrew the nomination, Mathews was reported to have responded: "Sir, if you had known me, you wouldn't have taken the nomination back; if you didn't know me, you should not have nominated me to such an important office."&lt;ref name=Patrick /&gt;

== Patriot War of East Florida ==
[[File:West Florida Map 1767.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|[[West Florida]], the original target of Gen. Mathews' mission to annex the Floridas for the United States.]]

"The East Florida revolution of 1812 was an embarrassing and shameful moment in the history of early American foreign policy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stagg|first1=J. C. A.|title=James Madison and George Mathews: The East Florida Revolution of 1812 Reconsidered|journal=Diplomatic History|date=2006|volume=30|issue=1|page=23|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=19148899&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=31 May 2016|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.2006.00536.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810, Mathews was recommended to President [[James Madison]] by Georgia Senator [[William Harris Crawford]] as a confidential agent to report on conditions in the Spanish Floridas, as Crawford believed an annexation of the territory to the United States was possible. Fearing the collapse of Spanish rule, President Madison sent Mathews to meet with Spanish governor of [[West Florida]], Don [[Vicente Folch]], in November, 1810, to inform the residents of East Florida that if they were to separate from Spain they would be welcomed into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herring|first1=George C.|title=From Colony To Superpower : U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780199743773|page=111|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=257637&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;ebv=EB&amp;ppid=pp_111|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folch indicated to Mathews that he was willing to transfer West Florida to the United States peacefully. Madison, on receiving this information, decided to try to [[Annexation|annex]] both East and West Florida all at once, seeking to take West Florida peacefully and giving Mathews "official instructions to assist a revolutionary movement in East Florida." Mathews was assigned an Indian agent, [[John McKee]]. The president, seeking to keep the United States seemingly removed from the plan, gave them instructions that were "remarkably vague and general."&lt;ref name="Knott1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen F. Knott|title=Secret and Sanctioned: Covert Operations and the American Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgYxLklV7UwC&amp;pg=PA93|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510098-3|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathews, then at 72 years of age, returned to the Spanish state with a commission of [[Brigadier General|brigadier general]] and again met with Governor Folch. Folch had gone cold on the trade and told Mathews that he did not intend to negotiate with Madison for the West. Mathews delivered the message to the White House, at which point [[Secretary of State]] [[James Monroe]] instructed Mathews to focus on forceful annexation of East Florida, "if he thought he could accomplish anything there."&lt;ref name="Knott1996" /&gt;
[[File:East Florida Patriot Flag.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|East Florida Patriot Flag, raised by the Patriot Army at Fernandina]]
Mathews and McKee proceeded in the subsequent months to create an intelligence network throughout East Florida to ascertain the political attitudes of the East Floridians towards the United States, determining that an insurrection against Spanish rule was achievable. Mathews became infected with [[malaria]] during the campaign, delaying the operation several months. Isaac Cox wrote that Mathews "spent the summer of 1811 alternately fighting malaria and encouraging insurrection."&lt;ref name="Knott1996" /&gt;

On March 13, 1812, Mathews, with a force of Georgians, launched his revolution at [[Original Town of Fernandina Historic Site#History|Fernandina]] on [[Amelia Island]]. With Mathews, the local insurgents known as the "Patriots of Amelia Island" seized the island and declared their independence. They hoisted a new flag of East Florida, designed by a member of Mathews' staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cusick|first=James G.|title=The other war of 1812 : the Patriot War and the American invasion of Spanish East Florida|year=2007|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|isbn=978-0820329215|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then turned his focus inland, writing to the President&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Papers of James Madison, Presidential Series, vol. 4, 5 November 1811-9 July 1812 and supplement 5 March 1809-19 October 1811|date=1999|publisher=University Press of Virginia|location=Charlottesville|pages=326|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/03-04-02-0341|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to convey the success and to request additional United States military personnel.&lt;ref name="Knott1996" /&gt;

As the insurrection grew, Congress became alarmed at the possibility of being drawn into war with Spain and their allies, the British. (However, a few months later the U.S. declared war on Britain, setting off the [[War of 1812]]). Mathews' operation had grown large enough and quickly enough that the United States could no longer deny involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monroe|first1=James|title=[Letter] 1812 Oct. 13, Department of State, [Washington, D.C. to] David B.

He and his cabinet would deny all involvement in the matter. Mathews decided to go to Washington to appeal his case personally. But, on the trip he became ill and was forced to stop in [[Augusta, Georgia]]. He died without reaching Washington.&lt;ref name="Knott1996" /&gt;

===Interpretations===
Historians have been divided over the legacy of the Patriot War of East Florida. Some agree that Mathews overstepped his authority and deliberately departed from Madison's intentions. Historian J.C.A. Stagg, in ''George Mathews and John McKee, Revolutionizing East Florida, Mobile, and Pensacola in 1812'' (2007), found sufficient evidence in correspondence between Mathews and Madison to determine that Mathews exaggerated his "remarkably vague"&lt;ref name="Knott1996" /&gt; instructions and acted well beyond Madison's intent.

|quote     = It has become conventional to regard the East Florida revolution of 1812 as a singularly colorful and controversial episode in the history of the early republic. Its colorful aspects have lent themselves to the writing of fast-paced narratives that make for good reading because its organizers -- United States government agents George Mathews and John McKee -- brought to the performance of their duties roughly equal proportions of outright illegality, low intrigue, and not a little incompetence.

It is now reasonably clear that the actions of Mathews and McKee in Florida and on the Gulf Coast between 1810 and 1812 departed far more from the policies of the [Madison] administration than they fairly reflected them.

Others believe Mathews had followed Madison's intentions, and that Madison had disowned the filibuster for political reasons, sacrificing Mathews' reputation in the process.&lt;ref name=Patrick/&gt; Historian G. Melvin Herndon, in ''George Mathews, Frontier Patriot'' (1969), offered a vindicating perspective for Mathews and places blame for the failure of the expedition on Madison for repudiating the assignment.&lt;ref name=Herndon/&gt;

|quote     = It is generally agreed that Mathews was the victim of a vacillating administration whose dictates he had served faithfully according to his own lights. He succeeded too well; and, under pressure from several sources, President Madison and Secretary Monroe deemed it necessary to sacrifice Mathews to quell the criticism of their Florida policy.

The '''Havemeyer family''' is a prominent family from [[New York (state)|New York]], of [[Germany|German]] origins, that owned significant sugar refining interests in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sugar and Columbia University|url=https://slaveryexhibits.ctl.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/sugarcolumbia

==History==

William Havemeyer (1770-1851) left [[Germany]] at age 15 and arrived in [[New York City]] after learning the trade of sugar refining in [[London]]. In New York he managed a sugar house on Pine Street before opening his own refinery on [[Vandam Street (Manhattan)|Vandam Street]] with his brother, Frederick Christian Havemeyer, who had come to New York in 1802. Together the two brothers operated the '''W. &amp; F.C. Havemeyer Company''' sugar refineries, before passing the business on to their sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Life, Letters and Addresses of John Craig Havemeyer|url=https://archive.org/details/lifelettersanda00havegoog|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[William Frederick Havemeyer]], retired from the sugar refining business in 1842 and entered politics, eventually serving three terms as Mayor of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Business World, Volume 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnsiAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1217&amp;dq=William+Frederick+Havemeyer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih6Zqs4JPcAhVRMawKHaNVCCcQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Frederick%20Havemeyer&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles F.

The Havemeyer refineries were incorporated as the [[American Sugar Refining Company]] in 1891 and became known as [[Domino Sugar]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diamond|first1=Anna|title=These Photos of the Abandoned Domino Sugar Refinery Document Its Sticky History|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/photos-abandoned-domino-sugar-refinery-document-sticky-history-180967578/|website=Smithsonian|accessdate=19 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century several of the family's members made notable contributions to the arts.

MacCallum was a soldier at the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] before he was admitted as a solicitor of England and Wales in 1953 and then of Hong Kong in 1956. He started his practice from 1956 to 1994 in Hong Kong. He was the senior partner of the leading law firm Wilkinson &amp; Grist.

He served in many public offices, including the membership of the council from 1969, vice-president in 1973, president in 1975 and 1976 and the membership Roll of Honour of the [[Law Society of Hong Kong]] and a core member of the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]].

In 1985 he was appointed to the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee]], a consultative committee for the drafting of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]]. He was part of the conservative wing [[Group of 89]] in the committee resisting the faster pace of democratisation. He initially intended to run in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1988|1988 Legislative Council election]] for the [[Commercial (First)|First Commercial]] [[functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituency]] elected by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. However, he was persuaded by the Group of 89 to make way for Veronica Wu, daughter-in-law of tycoon [[Cha Chi-ming]], who eventually lost to [[Jimmy McGregor]].&lt;ref name="party"&gt;{{cite news|title=It's party time for Hongkong's politicians|first=Bernard|last=Fong|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=20 August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacCallum also served in voluntary positions in the [[Salvation Army]], the Methodist International Church, [[St. James' Settlement (Hong Kong)|St. James’ Settlement]], Hong Kong Bible Society and Friends of Cambridge University Prince Philip Scholarships and Honorary Permanent President of the [[HKBU]] Foundation. He was the vice-chairman and a founding trustee of the Croucher Foundation appointed by Noel Croucher.&lt;ref name="Croucher"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute: Ian MacCallum|url=https://croucher.org.hk/ian-maccallum-vice-chairman-and-trustee-of-the-croucher-foundation-died-on-5th-april-2013-aged-82|work=Croucher Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''John Cabot House''' is a [[historic house]] at 117 Cabot Street in downtown [[Beverly, Massachusetts]].  Built in 1781 by a prominent local businessman and ship owner, it was the town's first brick mansion house.  It is now owned by Historic Beverly and open to the public five days a week.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==Description==
The John Cabot House is located in Beverly's downtown business district, on the east side of Cabot Street (its major thoroughfare) between Central Street and Franklin Place.  It is a three-story timber-framed structure, its exterior clad in red brick and capped by a truncated hip roof.  The main facade is five bays wide, with windows set in rectangular openings with splayed soldier brick headers.  Projecting brick courses separate the floors, and the third-floor windows are smaller in height, and butt against the elaborate dentillated roof cornice.  The main entrance projects slightly in a surround that includes sidelight windows, pilasters, and a corniced entablature.  The interior has a typical central stair plan, and retains most of its original woodwork, which is in a heavy late Georgian style.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=BEV.101|title=NRHP nomination and MACRIS inventory record for John Cabot House|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The house was built in 1781, and was the first brick mansion in Beverly.&lt;ref name=HistoricalSite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beverlyhistory.org/houses/cabot.html|title=Houses: The John Cabot House|first=|last=|publisher=[[Beverly Historical Society]]|date=|accessdate=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built for shipowner and privateer [[Capt. John Cabot]] (b. 1745 in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] to Joseph Cabot and Elizabeth Higginson).&lt;ref name=CaptJohnCabotDate&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WG8MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA275&amp;lpg=PA275|title=Historical collections of the Essex Institute, Volume IV|first=G.M.|last=Whipple|publisher=[[Essex Institute]]|date=1862|accessdate=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabot was prominent in the town's economy, having also cofounded the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]], America's first cotton mill.&lt;ref name=CaptJohnCabotCottonMill&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEhBAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206|title=Paine Ancestry: The Family of Robert Treat Paine, Signer of the Declaration of Independence|first=Sarah Cushing|last=Paine|publisher=David Clapp &amp; Son|date=1912|accessdate=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802, the house became the first office of the Beverly Bank,&lt;ref name=HistoricalSite/&gt; the tenth oldest bank in America, with Capt. John Cabot serving as one of seven original directors.  At that time, it was extended to the rear by a two-story wood-frame addition.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

In addition to period rooms, the John Cabot House features maritime, military, and children's exhibits as well as major changing exhibits. Historic Beverly's research facilities are also located here.

In 1985 he became the 11th member of the Issa families to attend College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA, where he pursued an accountancy degree, which included one year at the London School of Economics (LSE) in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey attending LSE|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=10 February 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey attending LSE|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=21 March 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He graduated in 1988 and Valedictorian Cum Laude with a number of awards, including the youngest resident Jamaican to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).&lt;ref name="Gets Student Award"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gets Student Award|newspaper=The Crusader|date=20 November 1987|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey is Valedictorian for the Class of 1988|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=29 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey is CPA|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=4 May 1988|page= Section 1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning home from university, he joined SuperClubs Resorts, which his father had started in the early 1980s.

== Career ==
Issa started work as the purchasing manager at the Grand Lido Negril, one of SuperClubs chain of resorts.  He became Resident Manager of the hotel a year later. During the next three years, Issa helped to reorganize the hotel as a resort for romantic vacations and honeymooners.

In 1991 he assumed the position of general manager of Couples Hotel, the first to be established as an all-inclusive by his father in 1978 when Issa was 12 years old.  He oversaw the refurbishment of the hotel. Issa was moved to the money-losing Grand Lido San Souci, which he made profitable within six months.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
 
In 1995, Issa was promoted to President of Development and Special Projects in the corporate office, a position in which he was involved in developing the various brands, including the establishment of new properties. He was subsequently promoted to Senior VP of Sales in 1996, and initiated a customer satisfaction program which led to increased bookings and sustained brand loyalty through repeat visits.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 1999, when Issa became Executive Vice-President, he instituted marketing programmes, including the establishment of a new website to take reservations online 24/7, which led to higher occupancy levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey's SuperClubs 'Leach on the Beach' promotion|newspaper=Travel Magazine|date=2 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SuperCluds Radio Remote Broadcast|newspaper=North Coast Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Superclub's Launching|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=23 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pictured with John Major, former British Prime Minister|newspaper=The Observer|date=10 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained at the helm of SuperClubs until 2003, when he left to concentrate his own business, the Cool Group of Companies trading as Cool Corp.

== Business Ventures ==

In 1994 created a company called Cool Corp, and started by opening a petrol station in St. Ann's Bay named Cool Oasis. The company grew strategically over the years as Issa engaged in various business ventures.

In 2001, Cool Automotive Distributors was established to deliver motor oil and lubricants to gas stations, auto stores, companies with fleet vehicles and trucking companies. IN 2014, it is one of the leading retailers of automobile-related lubricants and accessories in Jamaica, and also sells basic household products such as toilet paper and soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Growth of Cool|newspaper=The Business Observer|date=23 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shell name and workers to remain|newspaper=The Business Observer|date=23 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Neal &amp; Massy Splits Shell with Joey|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=10 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Issa formed Cool Card to distribute telephone cards in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, offering phone cards from Jamaica's three cellular phone providers, Digicel, Cable &amp; Wireless and MiPhone, and both cellular providers in Trinidad and Tobago, Digicel and bMobile. In 2003, he created Cool Biz, and introduced 'EZ Card'  an electronic top-up of telephone credit operated by over 3,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cool Card Centre introduces the 'EZ Card|url=http://gleaner.newspaperarchive.com/kingston-gleaner/2003-01-17/page-41/pageno-22588393?tag=cool+card+centre+introduces+the+ez+card&amp;rtserp=tags/cool-card-centre-introduces-the-ez-card|newspaper=The Financial Gleaner|date=17 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cool Card investment of $125M|newspaper=North Coast Times|date=28 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Issa started Cool Petroleum, which became the licensed user of Shell brands in Jamaica. The company distributed Shell bulk fuels, Shell chemicals and Shell lubricants, and  operasted an extensive network of more than 50 Shell service stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Growth of Cool; Cool Oasis is now one of the largest petroleum retailers in Jamaica|url=http://gleaner.newspaperarchive.com/kingston-gleaner/2005-10-14/page-76/pageno-52665022?tag=growth+of+cool+cool+oasis+is+now+one+of+the+largest+petroleum+retailers+in+jamaica&amp;rtserp=tags/growth-of-cool-cool-oasis-is-now-one-of-the-largest-petroleum-retailers-in-jamaica?ndt=ex&amp;pd=14&amp;py=2005&amp;pm=10|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=14 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
Issa undertook a number of extra-curricular activities while attending [[College of the Holy Cross]] in the US. He was the founder and editor of Holy Cross Journal of Political Economy in 1988. He also had a radio programme through which he informed of Jamaica's culture and heritage while playing Reggae music.&lt;ref name= "crusader"&gt;{{cite news|title=For the Record|url=http://college.holycross.edu/departments/archives/exhibits/crusader/crusader_pages/1980s/02-08-1985.pdf|newspaper=The Crusader|date=8 February 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "WCHC"&gt;{{cite news|title=WCHC Features Two Bold Freshmen|url=http://college.holycross.edu/departments/archives/exhibits/crusader/crusader_pages/1980s/02-08-1985.pdf|newspaper=The Crusader|date=8 February 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While attending [[London School of Economics]], he became President of the Afro-Caribbean Society, a multi-ethnic group which undertakes high-level discussions on social, political and economic development throughout the world.

Issa also founded a charity, Educate the Children Fund, while at LSE and was active in fundraising to send school books to Caribbean children.

When he returned to Jamaica in 1988, his passion for advocacy did not wane, especially as it relates to a credible social and economic environment, and accountability in governance.

In 2000, Issa participated in media discussions on the impact of the high murder rate on foreign direct investments (FDIs) and economic growth in Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Answer to crime problem... Deal with economic growth|newspaper=Sunday Herald, Dollars &amp; Sense |date=27 April 2000|page= Section B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issa also commented on the state of the tourism industry, advocating for government support to the small hotel sector and seeking to stem a brewing controversy of variable head tax rates for different cruise ship ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Issa on future of tourism in Jamaica|newspaper=Travel Agent Magazine, Hotels|date=27 April 2000|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Issa battling for the small European Plan (EP) hotels- 'Ochi' hotels cry for help|newspaper=The Gleaner, Re-discover the North East|date=30 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Issa on head tax: Cruise shipping now brewing|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=10 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Issa addressed public concerns about political corruption by suggesting paying politicians more,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pay Politicians more- Issa|url=http://gleaner.newspaperarchive.com/kingston-gleaner/2001-07-29/page-3/pageno-37696912?tag=pay+politicians+more+issa&amp;rtserp=tags/pay-politicians-more-issa?ndt=ex&amp;pd=29&amp;py=2001&amp;pm=7|newspaper=The Sunday Gleaner|date=29 July 2001|page=3A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issa had based his position on KPMG Peat Marwick figures which showed that politicians earn significantly less than top civil servants and private sector counterparts.

The following year, ahead of the 16 October, general elections, Issa took a stand for accountability in governance with what became known as the "Issa Initiative", calling for those seeking political office sign a pledge with their constituents promising that if elected, they would address two pivotal issues in their constituencies within a reasonable period of time. The idea resonated with people across the country and was supported by the two main political parties – the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] and the [[People's National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business heads to hold candidates accountable|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=25 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parties back move to make MPs accountable|url=http://gleaner.newspaperarchive.com/kingston-gleaner/2002-04-08/|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=8 April 2002|page= A1 and A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Gleaner'' newspaper called it a watershed in Jamaica's political culture, and said "the proposal from Joe Issa of the St. Ann Chamber of Commerce, which was taken up by the island's Chambers of Commerce has the potential of bringing about a change in the relationship between constituents and their elected representatives," and that "it would require a greater level of consultation between those who are seeking political office and those who they hope to represent, on the priority needs of the constituencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seeking accountability|newspaper=Editorial, The Gleaner|date=20 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A cartoon in The Gleaner depicted a politician telling an agitated female constituent, "just vote fi mi an' yu get light, water, telephone, roads, etc.", while Issa steps behind him with a covenant and pen, asking, "care to sign a pledge for just two of those?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheers to Joe Issa|newspaper=Outlook, Coasting with Garwin,The Gleaner|date=21 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cartoon, LasMay|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=27 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issa represented the island's 13 Chambers of Commerce during negotiations with the government concerning the Cess on street lights, intervening to avoid a threatened protest march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Issa on cess (tax) on street light:'Roll back cess now'|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=10 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Score another one for the St. Ann Chamber of Commerce|newspaper=Outlook, The Gleaner|date=31 March 2002|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business leaders oppose street light tax|newspaper=The Sunday Observer|date=10 March 2002|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==

In 1987, Issa founded the "Educate the Children Fund" while attending the LSE. The school adopted the program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Student Special|url=http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:cos524jiw/read/single#page/2/mode/2up|newspaper=Issue No.255 of LSE's paper, The Beaver|date=26 January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Fund was officially launched by Jamaica's then Acting High Commissioner in London, Dale Anderson. In his remarks, Anderson said Issa's initiative was particularly welcome at a time of scarce resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=|newspaper=The Star edition 5|date=February 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A year later, after completing his studies at College of the Holy Cross and becoming a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Issa launched the Joe Issa Holy Cross/Jamaica Scholarship Fund, which provided a scholarship to a talented undergraduate Jamaican child once every four years to attend his alma mater university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey Launches Joe Issa Holy Cross/Jamaica Scholarship|newspaper=Jamaica Record|date=14 July 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1991, while he was working at his parents' SuperClubs Grand Lido Negril resort, Issa launched a cricket and tennis training programme for young children in the parish of Negril.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey supporting sports- cricket|newspaper=Wednesday Observer|date=21 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey raising funds for literacy- Walkathon|newspaper=Outlook, The Gleaner|date=14 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey supporting junior tennis|newspaper=Daily Observer|date=11 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new millennium, Issa founded another charity, "Global Education 2000", to help Jamaican schools by partnering them with their US counterparts. The initiative has resulted in the implementation of various exchange programmes which have benefited several Jamaican schools and were widely reported in the Jamaican media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Expanding "Global Education 2000"|newspaper=North Coast Times|date=6–12 February 2000|page=13a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, while, at SuperClubs, Issa helped employees at the resorts to buy and develop land under a project called "People Development Programme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey Celebrating staff: helping workers to buy and develop land|newspaper=North Coast Times|date=11–17 Feb 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, as Chairman of Cool Corporation, a group of 'Cool' branded companies that cut across many industries, Issa has set up Cool Charities, and has donated hundreds of computers, books, air conditioners and other school-related supplies primarily to educational institutions in the parishes of St. Mary and St. Ann.

Issa volunteers as a Justice of the Peace (JP) for the parish of St Mary. He is a former director of First Global Bank, Guardian Life Limited and Supreme Ventures Limited; and board member of Seville Great House.

He has been bestowed with an honorary life membership of the Rotary and Kiwanis clubs and is a past President of the St. Ann Chamber of Commerce.

Also, since 1983, Issa has been serving as a Eucharistic Minister for the Catholic Church.

== Honours and awards ==
Issa was Valedictorian for the Class of 1988, a first for an international student and an Economics/Accounting major in the 148-year history of College of the Holy Cross, where he graduated with honours – Cum Laude.&lt;ref name="Gets Student Award"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey is Valedictorian for the Class of 1988|newspaper=The Sunday Gleaner|date=29 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He made history again in 1988, when he became the youngest resident Jamaican to pass all four parts of the prestigious Certified Public Accountant examination in one sitting; and was awarded the Most Outstanding Junior Student by the Massachusetts Society of CPAs Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey is a CPA|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=4 May 1988|page= Section 1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after taking charge as Executive Vice-President of SuperClubs in 1999, Issa succeeded in increasing bookings and building brand loyalty, which earned him the Jamaica Observer's Tourism's Brightest Spark award and a place among Jamaica's top 10 personalities for that year. The following year, he was among Jamaica's 10 sexiest men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Awarded Tourism's Brightest Spark- Joey in top 10 Personalities of 1999|newspaper=Social lives, Observer|date=30 January 2000|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 article in [[the New Yorker]] magazine, [[Harvard]] historian [[Jill Lepore]] criticized the theory of disruptive innovation as "a theory of change founded on panic, anxiety, and shaky evidence".  Lepore postulates that Linkner advises the aspiring disruptive innovators (in which he invests) that "the world is a terrifying place, moving at a devastating pace".  She suggests that Linkner's "job appears to be to convince a generation of people who want to do good and do well to learn, instead, remorselessness.  Forget rules, obligations, your conscience, loyalty, a sense of the commonweal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''KPMG''' is a [[professional service]] company and one of the [[Big Four accounting firms|Big Four auditors]], along with [[Deloitte]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]] (EY), and [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (PwC).

Seated in [[Amstelveen]], the [[Netherlands]], KPMG employs 189,000 people&lt;ref name="globalrevenuesfy16" /&gt; and has three lines of services: [[financial audit]], tax, and [[Management consulting|advisory]]. Its tax and advisory services are further divided into various service groups.

The name "KPMG" stands for "Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler." It was chosen when KMG (Klynveld Main Goerdeler) merged with Peat Marwick in 1987.

In about 1913, Frank Wilber Main founded Main &amp; Co. in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/87969871/|date=16 February 1914|publisher= Pittsburgh Daily Post, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|page=11|title=Newspaper article|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1917 [[Piet Klijnveld]] and Jaap Kraayenhof opened an accounting firm called [[Klynveld Kraayenhof &amp; Co.]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; 

In 1925 William Barclay Peat &amp; Co. and Marwick Mitchell &amp; Co., merged to form Peat Marwick Mitchell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icaew.com/~/media/Files/Library/subjects/accounting-history/family-trees/family-tree-peat-marwick-mclintock.pdf Family tree: Peat Marwick McLintock] ICEAW&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 Main LaFrentz &amp; Co was formed by the merger of Main &amp; Co and FW LaFrentz &amp; Co. In 1969 Thomson McLintock and Main LaFrentz merged forming McLintock Main LaFrentz International &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/about/events/past-events2/past-conferences/6ahic/publications/6AHIC-68_FINAL_paper.pdf|title= The forces of deinstiutionalisation and demise|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and McLintock Main LaFrentz International absorbed the general practice of Grace, Ryland &amp; Co.&lt;ref name="Chartered Accountants in England and Wales: A Guide to Historical Records"/&gt;

In 1979 [[Klynveld Kraayenhof &amp; Co.]] (Netherlands), McLintock Main LaFrentz (United Kingdom / United States) and Deutsche Treuhandgesellschaft (Germany) formed KMG (Klynveld Main Goerdeler) as a grouping of independent national practices to create a strong European-based international firm.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Deutsche Treuhandgesellschaft CEO [[Reinhard Goerdeler]] (son of leading anti-Nazi activist [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler|Carl Goerdeler]], who would have become Chancellor if [[Operation Valkyrie]] had succeeded) became the first CEO of KMG.  In the United States, Main Lafrentz &amp; Co. merged with Hurdman and Cranstoun to form Main Hurdman &amp; Cranstoun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accountingin.com/accounting-historians-journal/volume-19-number-1/the-development-of-the-big-eight-accounting-firms-in-the-united-states-1900-to-1990/|title=The Development of “The Big Eight” Accounting Firms in the United States, 1900 to 1990|publisher=Accounting Information|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in 1987 KMG and Peat Marwick joined forces in the first mega-merger of large accounting firms and formed a firm called KPMG in the US, and most of the rest of the world, and Peat Marwick McLintock in the UK.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In the Netherlands, as a consequence of the merger between PMI and KMG in 1988, PMI tax advisors joined Meijburg &amp; Co. (The tax advisory agency Meijburg &amp; Co. was founded by Willem Meijburg, Inspector of National Taxes, in 1939). Today, the Netherlands is the only country with two members of KPMG International: KPMG Audit (accountants) and Meijburg &amp; Co (tax consultants).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meijburg.com/page/history |title=Meijburg &amp; Co - History|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the firm was renamed KPMG Peat Marwick, and in 1999 the name was reduced again to KPMG.&lt;ref&gt;Note: KPMG derived from predecessor company founders: Piet '''K'''lijnveld, William Barclay '''P'''eat, James '''M'''arwick, and Reinhard '''G'''oerdeler.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1997, KPMG and [[Ernst &amp; Young]] announced that they were to merge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-10-21/business/1997294011_1_kpmg-peat-ernst-young-merger |title=Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG Peat Marwick to merge New company would be largest accounting, consulting firm in world |work=[[Baltimore Sun]] |date=21 October 1997 |accessdate=5 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/22/business/kpmg-partners-vote-for-ernst-merger.html |title=KPMG Partners Vote For Ernst Merger |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=22 December 1997 |accessdate=5 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while the merger to form [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] was granted regulatory approval, the KPMG/Ernst &amp; Young tie-up was later abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/56509.stm |title=Accountancy merger off |work=[[BBC News]] |date=13 February 1998 |accessdate=5 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/kmpg-and-ernst-call-off-18bn-accountancy-megamerger-1144724.html |title=KMPG and Ernst call off $18bn accountancy mega-merger  |work=[[The Independent]] |date=14 February 1998 |accessdate=5 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

KPMG's member firms in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein merged to form KPMG Europe LLP in October 2007. These member firms were followed by Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] (Azerbaijan, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Georgia), Turkey, Norway, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultant-news.com/article_display.aspx?p=adp&amp;id=7325 |title=Norway and Saudi Arabia to join KPMG Europe LLP |publisher=Consultant-news.com |date=1 November 2010 |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpmg.com/be/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/the-kpmg-difference/pages/norway-and-saudi-arabia-to-join-kpmg-europe-llp.aspx |title=Norway and Saudi Arabia to join KPMG Europe LLP |publisher=KPMG International |date=30 November 2010 |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appointed joint Chairmen, John Griffith-Jones and Ralf Nonnenmacher.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

== Global structure ==
Each national KPMG firm is an independent legal entity and is a member of KPMG International Cooperative, a Swiss entity registered in the Swiss [[Canton of Zug]]. KPMG International changed its legal structure from a [[Swiss Verein]] to a [[co-operative]] under Swiss law in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrazg.ch/ Handelsregister des Kantons Zug] (Registration Number CH-020.6.900.276-5)&lt;/ref&gt;

This structure in which the Cooperative provides support services only to the member firms is similar to other [[professional services networks]]. The member firms provide the services to client. The purpose is to limit the liability of each independent member.&lt;ref&gt;This is illustrated in the cases involving [[Parmalat]] where clients sought to hold Deloitte (the Swiss Verein)and Grant Thornton International (a UK company providing administrative services to its members) liable for the negligence of other member firms.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Thomas is KPMG's Global Chairman.  He was formerly Senior Partner and CEO of KPMG LLP, the KPMG member firm in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/contacts/t/william-b-thomas.html|title=William B. Thomas|publisher=KPMG|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some KPMG member firms are registered as multidisciplinary entities which also provide legal services in certain jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/alt-legal-all-your-profits-are-belong-to-us/|title=All Your Profits Are Belong To Us|publisher=Above the law|date=5 November 2014|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], regulations do not permit foreign auditing firms to operate.&lt;ref name="et"&gt;{{cite news |title=Deloitte, KPMG have no licence to do audit work in India |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/deloitte-kpmg-have-no-licence-to-do-audit-work-in-india/articleshow/3986506.cms |accessdate=29 September 2018 |publisher=Economic Times |date=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence KPMG carries out audits in India under the name of BSR &amp; Co, an auditing firm that it bought off. B.S.R &amp; Co was an auditing firm founded by B.S.Raut in Mumbai. In 1992, after India was forced to [[Economic liberalisation in India|liberalise]] as one of the conditions of the [[world bank]] and [[IMF]] [[bail out]], KPMG was granted a license to operate in India as an [[investment bank]]. It subsequently purchased B.S.R &amp; Co and conducts audits in India under the name of this firm.&lt;ref name="ie29sep"&gt;{{cite news |title=SFIO names KPMG arm in Reebok chargesheet |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/sfio-names-kpmg-arm-in-reebok-chargesheet/ |accessdate=29 September 2018 |publisher=The Indian Express |date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==
KPMG is organised into the following three service lines (the 2016 revenue shares are listed in parentheses):&lt;ref name="globalrevenuesfy16"/&gt;

* [[Audit]] (40%)
* [[Management consulting|Advisory]] (38%)
* [[Tax advisor|Tax]] (22%)

Tax arrangements relating to [[tax avoidance]] and multinational corporations and Luxembourg which were negotiated by KPMG became public in 2014 in the so-called ''[[Luxembourg Leaks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30412293|title= Disney and Skype 'used Luxembourg tax deals'|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community involvement and advocacy ==
In March 2017 KPMG launched a campaign designed to encourage more women to pursue careers in technology-based professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/450415622/KPMG-launches-campaign-to-encourage-women-into-tech|title=KPMG launches campaign to encourage women into tech|work=ComputerWeekly|access-date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, KPMG in the UK was named the best big company to work for by ''The Times''. This was the fourth consecutive year that KPMG had made the top three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Katherine Griffiths |date=3 April 2013 |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/best_100_companies/article3477883.ece |title=Best 100 Companies |work=The Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612112944/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/best_100_companies/article3477883.ece |archivedate=12 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, in the UK, KPMG introduced a programme known as 'Flexible Futures'. This allowed staff to volunteer to give the firm the option to either send them on a [[sabbatical]] at 30% pay for up to 12 weeks, or to reduce their working hours to 4 days a week. The option remained open to the firm until October 2010. This facility has been invoked by the firm in some departments. KPMG publicised this as innovative and an alternative approach to redundancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sam Fleming |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1119431/Four-day-week-As-work-dries-KPMG-offers-11-000-staff-dramatic-cut-hours-battle-save-jobs.html |title=Four day week as work dries up: KPMG offers 11,000 staff dramatic cut in hours to save jobs |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=16 January 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, for the eighth year in a row, KPMG was named one of "[[Canada's Top 100 Employers]]" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in ''[[Maclean's]]'' news magazine. In November 2010, KPMG was also named one of [[Greater Toronto's Top Employers]], which was announced by the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-kpmg|title=Reasons for Selection, 2009 Canada's Top 100 Employers Competition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in early 2012 that KPMG has about 11,000 staff in the UK and 9,000 in mainland China and Hong Kong. KPMG's global deputy chairman predicted that headcount in China would overtake that of the UK by the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/86e13fc2-468f-11e1-85e2-00144feabdc0.html |title=China headcount to overtake UK at top firms |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |date=25 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424103636/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/86e13fc2-468f-11e1-85e2-00144feabdc0.html |archivedate=24 April 2012 |first=Adam |last=Jones |deadurl=bot: unknown |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Tax shelter fraud===
{{Main|KPMG tax shelter fraud}}

===Carillion audit role===
In January 2018 it was announced that KPMG, auditor of collapsed UK construction firm [[Carillion]], would have its role examined by the [[Financial Reporting Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/01/15/carillion-auditor-kpmg-faces-scrutiny-approving-books-months/|title=Carillion auditor KPMG faces scrutiny for approving books months before collapse|date=15 January 2018|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was summoned to give evidence before two House of Commons select committees on 22 February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/work-and-pensions-committee/news-parliament-2017/carillion-big-four-17-19/|title=Committees publish responses from Big Four on Carillion|publisher=UK Parliament|date=13 February 2018|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 February 2018, the 'Big 4' accountancy firms, including KPMG, were described by MP [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]] as "feasting on what was soon to become a carcass" after collecting fees of £72m for Carillion work during the years leading up to its collapse.&lt;ref name="Davies-13Feb2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Rob|title=Carillion: accountants accused of 'feasting' on company|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/13/carillion-accountants-accused-of-feasting-on-company|accessdate=13 February 2018|work=Guardian|date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; KPMG was singled out for particular criticism for signing off Carillion's last accounts before a profit warning in July 2017: "Either KPMG failed to spot the warning signs, or its judgement was clouded by its cosy relationship with the company and the multimillion-pound fees it received," said MP [[Rachel Reeves]].&lt;ref name="Davies-13Feb2018" /&gt; Two out of three former Carillion finance directors had also worked for KPMG.&lt;ref name="Davies-13Feb2018" /&gt;

KPMG defended itself, saying that in the construction industry "an accumulation of adverse events [...] can quite quickly cause a precipitous decline." KPMG chairman and senior partner Bill Michael said: "It does not follow automatically from a company collapse either that the opinion of management was wrong, or that the auditor did a bad job."&lt;ref name="Davies-13Feb2018" /&gt;

On 22 February 2018, MPs contested evidence from KPMG (in one exchange MP [[Peter Kyle (politician)|Peter Kyle]] told KPMG partner Peter Meehan: "I would not hire you to do an audit of the contents of my fridge").&lt;ref name="Marriage-22Feb2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marriage|first1=Madison|title=MPs turn fire on KPMG and Deloitte partners over Carillion|url=https://www.ft.com/content/71c8f2b8-17d7-11e8-9e9c-25c814761640|accessdate=22 February 2018|work=Financial Times|date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Reeves, chair of the business select committee, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Auditing is a multi-million-pound business for the Big Four. On this morning's evidence from KPMG and Deloitte, these audits appear to be a colossal waste of time and money, fit only to provide false assurance to investors, workers and the public. [...] Carillion staff and investors could see the problems at the company but those responsible - auditors, regulators, and, ultimately, the directors – did nothing to stop Carillion being driven off a cliff.&lt;ref name="ParlUK-22Feb2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carillion audits – colossal waste of time and money|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-energy-industrial-strategy/news-parliament-2017/carillion-tpr-17-191/|website=Parliament.uk|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The final report of the Parliamentary inquiry into Carillion's collapse, published on 16 May 2018,&lt;ref name="Davies-16May2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Rob|title='Recklessness, hubris and greed' – Carillion slammed by MPs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/16/recklessness-hubris-and-greed-carillion-slammed-by-mps|accessdate=16 May 2018|work=Guardian|date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticised KPMG for its "complicity" in the company's financial reporting practices:

&lt;blockquote&gt;KPMG audited Carillion for 19 years, pocketing £29 million in the process. Not once during that time did they qualify their audit opinion on the financial statements, instead signing off the figures put in front of them by the company's directors. Yet, had KPMG been prepared to challenge management, the warning signs were there in highly questionable assumptions about construction contract revenue and the intangible asset of goodwill accumulated in historic acquisitions. These assumptions were fundamental to the picture of corporate health presented in audited annual accounts. In failing to exercise—and voice—professional scepticism towards Carillion's aggressive accounting judgements, KPMG was complicit in them. It should take its own share of responsibility for the consequences.&lt;ref name="Carillion report conclusion"&gt;{{cite book|title=Carillion: Second Joint report from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Work and Pensions Committees of Session 2017–19|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmworpen/769/769.pdf|date=2018|publisher=House of Commons|location=London|pages=90–91|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The select committee chairs (Frank Field and Rachel Reeves) called for a complete overhaul of Britain's corporate governance regime, saying the government had "lacked the decisiveness or bravery" to do so, accused the big four accounting firms of operating as a "cosy club", with KPMG singled out for its "complicity" in signing off Carillion's "increasingly fantastical figures".&lt;ref name="Davies-16May2018"/&gt;

KPMG said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe we conducted our audit appropriately. However, it's only right that following a corporate collapse of such size and significance, the necessary investigations are performed. Auditing large and complex businesses involves many judgments and we will continue to cooperate with the FRC's ongoing investigation. ... We welcome any future review of our profession. If we consider how the profession has changed in the last decade […] it is clear there is a need for us to look closely at our business models.&lt;ref name="Davies-16May2018"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a June 2018 report on audit standards across eight accounting firms, the FRC identified "failure to challenge management and show appropriate scepticism across their audits." It highlighted a decline in the quality of work undertaken by the Big Four, with KPMG performing the worst. There had, the FRC said, been an "unacceptable deterioration" in the quality of KPMG's work, and the FRC would scrutinise KPMG more closely as a result.&lt;ref name="Davies-18Jun2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Davies |first1=Rob |title=KPMG singled out in critical report on audit industry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/18/kpmg-singled-out-in-critical-report-on-audit-industry |accessdate=19 June 2018 |work=Guardian |date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, the FRC proposed reforms to tackle the "underlying falling trust in business and the effectiveness of audit," and severely rebuked KPMG.&lt;ref name="Collinson-8Oct2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Collinson |first1=Patrick |title=Accounting watchdog could ban auditors from consultancy work |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/08/accounting-auditors-consultancy-frc-kpmg |accessdate=8 October 2018 |work=Guardian |date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, KPMG said it would no longer undertake consultancy work for [[FTSE 350 Index]]-listed companies if it was also auditing them, in an effort to "remove even the perception of a possible conflict" of interest.&lt;ref name="BBC-09Nov2018"&gt;{{cite news |title=KPMG stops consultancy for audit clients |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46145219 |accessdate=9 November 2018 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carillion investigation followed FRC investigations into KPMG's role at [[HBOS]], Quindell and [[The Co-operative Bank]]. In July 2018, the FRC started an investigation into KPMG's audit role at collapsed drinks merchant [[Bargain Booze|Conviviality]].&lt;ref name="Vincent-3Jul2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vincent |first1=Matthew |title=Opening Quote: KMPG audit probed . . . again |url=https://www.ft.com/content/99604c5a-7e8d-11e8-bc55-50daf11b720d |accessdate=3 July 2018 |work=Financial Times |date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 South African corruption scandal===

In 2017, KPMG was embroiled in related scandals involving the [[Gupta family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.biznews.com/global-investing/2017/07/11/mckinsey-guptaleaks-south-africans/|title=South Africans urge US law-enforcers to bring Gupta and friends down with McKinsey - BizNews.com|date=11 July 2017|work=BizNews.com|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; KPMG, whose history in South Africa dated back to 1895, and which had been part of the international organization since its founding in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://home.kpmg.com/za/en/home/about/history.html|title=History|publisher=KPMG South Africa|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; faced calls for closure, and an uncertain future, as a consequence of the damage done to the South African economy as a result of its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-radio/why-i-stepped-away-from-munich-re-of-africa-over-kpmg/|title=KPMG will die a natural death – Abedian|date=15 September 2017|publisher=Moneyweb|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kpmg-safrica-exclusive/exclusive-south-africas-central-bank-tells-lenders-that-kpmg-is-too-big-to-fail-idUSKCN1C416G|title=Exclusive: South Africa's central bank tells lenders that KPMG is 'too big to fail'|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KPMG had been working with a Gupta family company in the mining sector, Oakbay Resources and Energy, for 15 years prior to the revelations of corruption and collusion in 2016, at which point KPMG resigned. The full impact and financial profit that KPMG received is yet to be determined;&lt;ref name="timesKPMG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/businesstimes/2016/04/04/KPMG-Sasfin-cut-links-with-Gupta-firm | title=KPMG, Sasfin cut links with Gupta firm | publisher=[[Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]] | agency=Reuters| date=4 April 2016 | accessdate=7 April 2016 | author=Cropley, Ed &amp; Motsoeneng, Tisetso}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, at least one large company has terminated its services with KPMG due to its relationship with Oakbay.&lt;ref name="mgKPMG1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://mg.co.za/article/2017-07-28-00-kpmg-put-through-the-wringer | title=JSE-listed Sygnia fires KPMG over 'Gupta links' | publisher=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] | date=28 July 2017 | accessdate=30 August 2017 | author=Steyn, Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, after controversial documents were leaked by the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism, former chief executive of KPMG South Africa and the former partner that was responsible for audits related to the Gupta family, Moses Kgosana, withdrew from becoming the chairman of [[Alexander Forbes Group Holdings|Alexander Forbes]], a financial services firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wessels|first1=Vernon|title=Ex-KPMG South Africa Boss Quits New Role to Face Gupta Claims|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-03/ex-kpmg-south-africa-boss-quits-new-role-to-face-gupta-claims|accessdate=22 September 2017|agency=Bloomberg|date=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet unrepentant Gupta tax dodge ‘lapdog’ Moses Kgosana, KPMG heavyweight (5 July 2017)|url=http://www.biznews.com/guptaleaks/2017/07/05/moses-kgosana-gupta-kpmg/|website=Biznews.com|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, KPMG issued a controversial report that implicated former Finance Minister [[Pravin Gordhan]] in the creation of an illegal intelligence gathering unit of the [[South African Revenue Service]] (SARS). This report was seen by elements of the media to be part of a wider Gupta-linked [[state capture]] conspiracy, with the aim of forcing Gordhan out of his post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2017-07-04-after-the-gupta-wedding-and-the-sars-rogue-unit-report-fiascos-what-future-for-kpmg-in-south-africa/#.WcIo2oyCxPY |title=After the Gupta wedding and the SARS 'Rogue Unit' report fiascos: What future for KPMG in South Africa? |publisher=Daily Maverick |date=4 July 2017 |accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was withdrawn by KPMG in September 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pieter du Toit Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost South Africa |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/09/15/kpmg-shocker-audit-firm-disavows-sars-rogue-unit-report-eight-senior-staff-resign_a_23210381/ |title=KPMG Shocker: Audit Firm Disavows Sars 'Rogue Unit' Report, Eight Senior Staff Resign |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.za |date=15 September 2017 |accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; earning the ire of the Commissioner of SARS, Tom Moyane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2017-09-18-all-out-wars-as-sars-blames-kpmg-for-reputational-damage/|title=All out wars as SARS blames KPMG for reputational damage|date=18 September 2017|publisher=Times Live|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an internal investigation that found work done for the Gupta family fell "considerably short" of the firm's standards and amid rising political and public backlash, KPMG's senior leadership in South Africa, including its chairman Ahmed Jaffer, CEO Trevor Hoole, COO Steven Louw, and five partners, resigned in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KPMG SA leadership axed in wake of Gupta revelations|url=http://www.enca.com/south-africa/kpmg-sa-leadership-axed-in-wake-of-gupta-revelations|accessdate=15 September 2017|publisher=ENCA|date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brock|first1=Joe|title=KPMG South Africa senior leaders resign over Gupta scandal|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/kpmg-south-africa-gupta-scandal-senior-leaders-resign-auditor-government-contracts-trevor-hoole-a7948286.html|accessdate=22 September 2017|work=The Independent|date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, the ABA Economics of Law Practice Section, the predecessor of the ABA Law Practice Division, published ''Legal Economic News'' a four-page newsletter, but with an expanding audience, the Section Council determined upon a magazine format titled ''Legal Economics'' in November, 1974.  Robert P. Wilkins was instrumental in establishing the new Section magazine and served as its first Editor in Chief.  Although an attorney by profession, Wilkins published a regional magazine, ''[[Sandlapper: The Magazine of South Carolina ]]''.  Arnold Fisher was Articles Editor and Delmar L. Roberts served as Managing Editor.  The first issue of ''Legal Economics'' appeared in the Spring of 1975 with a press run of 15,000 even though the membership of the Section was significantly less.  The additional copies were utilized to promote membership in the Section.  By August, 1977, advertisements in ''Legal Economics'' surpassed those in the ABA Law Student Division’s ''Student Lawyer'', but trailed those in the ABA Young Lawyers Division’s ''Barrister'' and the ''ABA Journal''.  By August, 1981, however, advertisements in ''Legal Economics'' exceeded all but the ABA Journal.    The Division magazine is now ''Law Practice'' and has been considered one of the leading Division benefits by membership and has contributed to the immense growth of the Division. 

According to [[Ulrich's Periodicals Directory]], it has a circulation of 19,000.

'''Léon L. Gallet''' (1832–1899), watchmaker, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and past family patriarch of the [[Gallet &amp; Co.|Gallet Watch Company]] of Switzerland,&lt;ref name=GGhist&gt;"Gallet Watch Company History" [http://www.galletwatch.com/new_yesterday.html Gallet-hist]&lt;/ref&gt; is considered as one of the primary architects and founders of the 19th century industrialization of the Swiss watchmaking industry.

==Life==
The son of Julien Gallet (1806–1849), who moved the family watchmaking business from Geneva, Switzerland, to the manufacturing district of La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1826, Léon L. Gallet was responsible for the creation of numerous Swiss and American watch brands.&lt;ref&gt;Jewelers' Circular Keystone, May 17, 1899, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was the prestigious Fabrique Electa, which became the upscale line of the jewelry department at Macy’s Department store in New York City during the first quarter of the 20th century. Léon L. Gallet also established the brands National Park, Continental Watch Company, Jerome Park, Bridgeport, Eureka, Commodore, Union Square, and Lady Racine.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen H. Pritchard, Swiss Timepiece Makers 1775-1975, (2 Bände), West Kennebunk 1997&lt;/ref&gt; While the appearance and function of many of Gallet’s timepieces were tailored to the tastes of the American consumers, all of the movements in these watches were manufactured in Switzerland.

Léon Gallet played a philanthropic role in the business, cultural, and social life of his native home. As well as his prominent position as a member of both the legislature of Neuchâtel and the Council of La Chaux-de-Fonds, he was for many years, the president of the Société des Amis des Arts (Fine Arts Society) and Grand Master of the Free Masons. Together with Louis &amp; Jules Courvoisier, Ernest Francillon of Longines, and Constant Girard-Perregaux, Léon Gallet founded the Société Intercantonale des Industries du Jura (Intercantonal Society for the Industries of the Jura Area) in 1876. The purpose of this organization was to assist in the promotion and distribution of products from Switzerland's Watch Valley while addressing the growing threat of competition in European markets from American watch manufacturers.

Upon his death in 1899, Léon Gallet bequeathed a sum of 43,000 Swiss Francs (today equivalent to 1,000,000 Swiss Francs or approx. 1,000,000 US dollars) to his hometown of La Chaux-de-Fonds, of which 25,000 Swiss Francs were earmarked to build the [[Musée International d'Horlogerie]] (International Watch Making Museum).&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, Catherine; Piquet, Jean-Michel (2002), Musée International d'Horlogerie, Catalogue of Selected Pieces, Switzerland: Institut l'homme et le temps, {{ISBN|2-940088-10-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Donated by Léon Gallet’s son Georges, the museum’s collection was started with a body of over 100 of Gallet's most complicated and valuable timepieces, including the world's first wristwatch produced for mass consumption in 1892. The balance of the bequeathed funds was used to construct the Musée des beaux-arts de La Chaux-de-Fonds (Beaux Arts Museum of La-Chaux-de-Fonds), designed by renowned painter [[Charles l’Eplattenier]] and architect René Chapallaz, [[Le Corbusier]]'s architecture teacher.

Prior to his passing, Léon Gallet commissioned René Chapallaz, to design "Villa Gallet". Situated in "Parc Gallet" in the southern part of La Chaux-de-Fonds, "Villa Gallet" still retains its original name and is considered as an important historic contribution to the Swiss [[Art Nouveau]] movement of the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;L'Inventaire Suisse d'Architecture: 1850-1920, Volume 3, Bienne, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Coire, Davos.

== Léon L. Gallet &amp; The Industrialization of the Swiss Watch Industry ==

Any study of the 19th century industrialization of [[Switzerland]]’s “Watch Valley” is not complete without mentioning the role of watchmaker and entrepreneur, Léon L. Gallet.

In the years following [[American Civil War|America’s Civil War]], a powerful shift of that country’s concentration moved from agriculture to industry. With this shift came great advancements in manufacturing as centrally located factories replaced small workshops, and large scale production of items with interchangeable parts quickly displaced less efficient hand-crafting. An immediate beneficiary of this progress was America’s watch and clock industry, as northern coal powered factories began turning out hundreds of high quality timepieces per day. On the horizon for these newly empowered companies was the inevitable expansion beyond domestic borders to embark in direct competition with the Swiss watchmaking industry.

Léon L. Gallet and [[Ernest Francillon]] of [[Longines]], two Swiss watchmakers who were actively selling their wares in North America, saw the writing on the wall. Recognizing the only way that the small workshops of Switzerland’s “[[Watch Valley]]” could compete against the growing threat posed by larger American manufacturers was to unite. At the prompting of Gallet and Francillon, a new organization was created. The Société Intercantonale des Industries du Jura (Intercantonal Society of the [[Jura Mountains|Jura Industries]]) was formed to bring together the individual strengths of the region’s numerous independent watchmaking houses as a powerful cooperative entity.

Yet, in spite of the formation of this new organization, the warnings of Gallet and Francillon were met with skepticism by the other members of the group. Decades of success as the world’s primary supplier of fine timepieces had resulted in a self-assured complacency within [[Switzerland]]’s watchmaking industry.

Then on the 10th of May, 1876, the great [[Centennial Exposition|Philadelphia International Exhibition]], created to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the signing of [[United States Declaration of Independence|America’s Declaration of Independence]], opened to the public. Among the many displays was the indisputable evidence of the manufacturing superiority of such American companies as [[Waltham Watch Company|Waltham]] and [[Elgin National Watch Company|Elgin]], each capable of finishing many hundred watches per day.

Jacques David, Swiss watchmaker and machine designer, was dispatched to America by Ernest Francillon to witness the exhibitions first-hand, and report his findings back to the Intercanonal Society. Léon L. Gallet followed shortly behind, arriving in [[Philadelphia]] the next month. What both men witnessed at the exhibition further confirmed the concerns of Gallet and Francillon.

On his return to Switzerland in November, Jacques David wrote a long detailed report on the mens' findings to the Intercantonal Society of the Jura Industries. While David’s report helped to wake the Swiss watchmaking industry from its comfortable complacency, increased revenues were needed for the Society’s members to initiate the developments required to meet these new challenges.

By the time that the Philadelphia Exposition opened to the public in 1876, Léon L. Gallet had already established sales offices in both [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]], going back over ten years. He had personally suffered a number of long ocean voyages to deliver his wares and to conduct business. Besides his acute knowledge of the growing threat posed by worldwide competition from US manufactures, Gallet understood the tastes of the American consumer and the opportunities the new world also held for the Jura watchmakers.

With the now available joint resources from fellow manufacturing members of the Intercantonal Society, Gallet decided to take the competitive battle directly to the enemy. Not only could the rapidly expanding base of American consumers provide opportunities for increased sales of Swiss watches, these sales could provide the needed revenues to meet the expected competitive challenges in Europe.

Utilizing his own movements, as well as components by such friends as Auguste [[Agassiz family|Agassiz]], Ernest Francillon, Constant [[Girard-Perregaux]], Jules Jeanneret, and Louis and Jules Courvoisier, Gallet began production of 30 new watch brands, most designed specifically to appeal to the taste of the America consumer.

Within a short period, exports of Swiss watches to America rapidly increased, greatly expanding the reach of watchmakers whose previous market was limited only to the local economies. As a result, Leon L. Gallet’s American marketing activities helped to provide the needed capital for the watchmakers of the Jura region to industrialize, and successfully meet one of the greatest challenges in Swiss timekeeping’s history.

More recent reports suggest that their wealth and influence, though reduced, remain significant.&lt;ref&gt;"Serb businessman proposes Kosovo conference in Belgrade," ''Associated Press Newswires'', 17 May 1999; "Businessman reportedly wants to return to Serbia to "clear his name" in court," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 18 April 2014 (Source: Vecernje novosti website, Belgrade, in Serbian 14 Apr 14).&lt;/ref&gt; Milanka Karić has been active in several of the family's business and philanthropic concerns, including serving as president of the Karić Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/vesti/drustvo/urucene-nagrade-braca-karic/mb2shcf Uručene nagrade "Braća Karić"], ''Blic'' (Source: Tanjug), 8 October 2012, accessed 18 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otvoreniparlament.rs/poslanik/7913 MILANKA KARIĆ], Otvoreni Parlament, accessed 18 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
===2008 presidential campaign===
Karić ran as the Strength of Serbia Movement's candidate for [[president of Serbia]] in the [[Serbian presidential election, 2008|2008 election]], when her husband was outside the country to avoid criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;"Serbian ruling coalition facing more problems despite recent accord, agency says," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 27 December 2007 (Source: Beta Week, Belgrade, in English 27 Dec 07).&lt;/ref&gt; Her campaign slogan was, "Family Is the Strength of Serbia."&lt;ref&gt;"Serb politicians use old slogans in 2017 campaign - analysis," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 30 March 2017 (Source: Politika website in Serbian 0900 gmt 29 Mar 17).&lt;/ref&gt; She received 40,332 votes (0.98%), placing seventh in a field of nine candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-predsednika-2008.php Избори за председника Републике, одржани 20. јануара и 3. фебруара 2008. године (РЕЗУЛТАТИ ИЗБОРА: Извештај о резултатима избора за председника Републике одржаних 20. јануара 2008. године)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 18 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentarian===
Strength of Serbia fielded its own [[electoral list]] for the National Assembly of Serbia in the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2007|2007]] and [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2008|2008]] parliamentary elections; Karić led the list in 2007 and was given the second position in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-2007.php Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 21. јануара и 8. фебрауара 2007. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (Покрет снага Србије - Богољуб Карић)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 25 August 2017; and [http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-2008.php Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 11. маја 2008. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (Покрет СНАГА СРБИЈЕ - Богољуб Карић)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 25 August 2017. Karić received the first position on the list in 2007 and the second position in 2008. It may be noted that her numerical position was actually irrelevant to her chances of election. From 2000 to 2011, parliamentary mandates were awarded to lists rather than to individual candidates, and it was a common practice for mandates to be awarded out of numerical order. See Law on the Election of Representatives, Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 35/2000, made available via [http://www.legislationline.org/topics/country/5/topic/6 LegislationOnline], accessed 28 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In each instance, the list failed to cross the [[electoral threshold]] to win representation in the assembly.

Karić attended a major opposition rally in 2011, conveying greetings from her husband and announcing Strength of Serbia's alliance with the leadership of the [[Serbian Progressive Party]].&lt;ref&gt;"Opposition rally unlikely to produce early elections in Serbia - analysts," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 7 February 2011 (Source: Danas website, Belgrade, in Serbian 7 Feb 11).&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength of Serbia contested the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]] as part of the Progressive Party's [[Let's Get Serbia Moving]] coalition. Karić was awarded the ninth position on the coalition's electoral list and was elected when the list won seventy-three mandates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-2012.php Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине, 6. мај 2012. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (POKRENIMO SRBIJU - TOMISLAV NIKOLIĆ)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 26 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Progressive Party emerged as the head of a [[coalition government]] after this election, and Karić served as part of its parliamentary majority. The Strength of Serbia Movement's alliance with the Progressive Party continued into the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2014|2014]] and [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2016|2016]] elections; Karić was included on its list both times and was re-elected when the Progressive-led alliance won landslide victories.&lt;ref&gt;Karić received the forty-fourth position on the list in 2015 and the sixty-ninth position in 2016. See [http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-2014.php Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 16. и 23. марта 2014. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (ALEKSANDAR VUČIĆ - BUDUĆNOST U KOJU VERUJEMO)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 26 January 2017; and [http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-2016-izborne-liste.php Избори за народне посланике 2016. године » Изборне листе (АЛЕКСАНДАР ВУЧИЋ - СРБИЈА ПОБЕЂУЈЕ)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 17 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karić is a member of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee; a deputy member of the committee on the judiciary, public administration, and local self-government; the head of Serbia's parliamentary friendship group with [[Kazakhstan]]; and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Croatia]], [[Cuba]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Malta]], [[Mexico]], [[Montenegro]], [[Russia]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States of America]]. Though still a member of the Strength of Serbia Movement, she serves in the Progressive Party's parliamentary group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlament.gov.rs/national-assembly/composition/members-of-parliament.591.488.html MILANKA KARIC], National Assembly of Serbia, accessed 18 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oliver Ames''' (February 4, 1831 – October 22, 1895) was an American businessman, financier and politician from [[Massachusetts]].  He was the son of [[Oakes Ames]] (1804–1873), a railroad baron behind the construction of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (UP) who was notably censured in the [[Credit Mobilier scandal]] for actions taken while a [[United States Congress]]man.  Ames was executor of his father's estate, and took over many of his business interests.  A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he served as the [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|35th]] [[Governor of Massachusetts]] (1887–1890).  He was a major philanthropist, especially in his hometown of [[Easton, Massachusetts|Easton]], which is graced by [[H. H. Richardson Historic District of North Easton|a number of architecturally significant works]] by [[H.H. Richardson]] as a result of his influence.

==Early years==
Oliver Ames was born in [[Easton, Massachusetts|North Easton, Massachusetts]] on February 4, 1831, to [[Oakes Ames]] and Eveline Orville (Gilmore) Ames.  His father was the owner of [[Ames Shovel Shop|a shovel factory]], which became the largest such business in the country.  Ames was educated in the local schools, and then attended private academies in [[North Attleborough, Massachusetts|North Attleborough]] and [[Leicester Academy|Leicester]].&lt;ref name=Davis384&gt;Davis, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;  He was briefly employed in the family's factory before enrolling in [[Brown University]]&lt;ref name="Clarke 1885 187"/&gt;  in 1851.  He spent three years there, in a custom-designed program overseen by university president [[Francis Wayland]].&lt;ref&gt;Roe, p. 666&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Ames then entered the family business, where he learned all aspects of its manufacturing processes and worked as a traveling salesman.  When [[Oliver Ames, Sr.|his grandfather Oliver]] died in 1863, he became a partner in the business.&lt;ref name=Davis384/&gt;  During the [[American Civil War]], he oversaw the manufacturing department, introducing efficiencies in the manufacturing processes and expanding the business.&lt;ref name=Purcell255/&gt;  During these years his grandfather, uncle, and father, in addition to expanding the shovel business, invested in railroads and other industrial concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Ames, Oakes|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Oakes Ames - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Oakes Ames]], Brady-Handy portrait]]
Ames' father and uncle ([[Oliver Ames, Jr.|also named Oliver]]) were leading figures in the Union Pacific, as well as principals in [[Crédit Mobilier of America]], a corporation established by Union Pacific insiders to siphon profits from the railroad construction.&lt;ref&gt;Klein (1997), pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt;  Oakes Ames, while a member of Congress in the 1860s, sold shares of Crédit Mobiler to other Congressmen, priced at [[par value]], which was well below their estimated [[market value]].  When this was exposed in 1872, it was determined by a Congressional investigating committee to be for the purpose of influencing railroad-related legislation.  The scandal resulted in his [[censure]], and he died not long afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper and Fenton, pp. 201–214&lt;/ref&gt;  Ames became co-executor and heir to his father's fortune, which included a nationwide network of business interests, as well as $6–8 million in debts, most of them related to the Union Pacific and Crédit Mobilier scandal.  Over a period of years, Ames was able to pay off the debts, provide more than $1 million in bequests, and divide the estate amongst the heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent, p. 913&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jay Gould 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Jay Gould]], c. 1880s photo]]
Ames's relationship with the Union Pacific (UP) took years of legal action to unwind.  In 1875, financier [[Jay Gould]] obtained control of the UP, while a group of mainly Ames-dominated Boston investors retained control of Crédit Mobilier (CM).&lt;ref&gt;Klein (2006), pp. 316–320&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter company was mired in legal action related to the scandal, and its shares were a major component of Oakes Ames's estate.  The company's only major asset was a $2 million note against UP, and Ames instigated legal action by CM to recover its value.  Gould and UP countersued, offering CM shareholders equivalent UP stock in a bid to gain control over CM.  This gambit largely succeeded, with most CM shareholders, including Ames's uncle, agreeing to the deal.  Ames rejected the deal, and became the principal opponent to Gould's later actions.&lt;ref&gt;Klein (2006), pp. 321–322&lt;/ref&gt;  Gould successfully ousted Ames from the CM board, which (under Gould's control) then voted to discontinue its lawsuit.  Ames launched legal action as a shareholder, and succeeded in forcing CM into [[receivership]] in 1879, with himself as the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;Klein (2006), pp. 404–405&lt;/ref&gt;  The legal wrangling continued until 1880, with most of the holdout shareholders eventually being bought out by Gould for $20/share plus costs.&lt;ref&gt;Klein (2006), pp. 547–549&lt;/ref&gt;

During the legal wrangling over the UP, Ames scored a significant business coup with Gould.  In the 1860s, Ames acquired (for a low price) a controlling interest in the [[Central Branch Union Pacific Railroad]], a paper railroad, separate from the UP, which was chartered to provided service in [[Kansas]].&lt;ref name=Klein411/&gt;  In the late 1870s, he personally oversaw the acquisition of rights of way and construction of the railroad.&lt;ref name=Davis384/&gt;  He sold it to Gould, who was assembling pieces of a full transcontinental rail network under the UP umbrella,&lt;ref name=Klein411&gt;Klein (2006), p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; for $250/share.&lt;ref name=Davis384/&gt;

==Political career==
Ames entered public life with the stated intent to vindicate his father's memory.&lt;ref name=americana&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Ames, Oliver (son)|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His early political activities included sitting on Easton's School Committee, and chairing the local [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] committee.&lt;ref name="Clarke 1885 187"/&gt;  He decided to run for [[Massachusetts State Senate|state senate]] in 1879, after he was unsuccessful in securing passage for the separation of the [[Martha's Vineyard]] community of Cottage City, where he owned a summer house, from [[Edgartown, Massachusetts|Edgartown]].&lt;ref name=Cutter331&gt;Cutter, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;  Winning election, he saw through the incorporation of the town (now known as [[Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts|Oak Bluffs]]).&lt;ref name=Davis385&gt;Davis, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;  He also sat on the committees overseeing railroads and schools.&lt;ref name=Cutter331/&gt;

In 1882, Ames received the Republican nomination for [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts]], alongside gubernatorial nominee Senate President [[Robert R. Bishop]].  In a bitterly divisive contest dominated by issues of corruption at the national level, and temperance at the local level, Democrat [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] defeated Bishop, but Ames won his race.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, pp. 7–9&lt;/ref&gt;  Ames served from 1883 to 1886, first under Butler (for one term) and then [[George D. Robinson]] (for three).&lt;ref name=Davis385/&gt;  In 1883, the Massachusetts legislature passed a resolution exonerating his father, and called on Congress to reverse the censure.&lt;ref name=Clarke189&gt;Clarke, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period he also oversaw the sale by the state of its interests in the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] and the [[Hoosac Tunnel]].&lt;ref name=Davis385/&gt;  He was at first criticized for the relatively low price (shares were sold at 1/3 of par value), but it was later seen to be a good deal.&lt;ref name=Purcell255/&gt;

With Governor Robinson retiring in 1886, Ames won election as [[Governor of Massachusetts]], and served three lackluster one-year terms.  One of the major political issues in his first two races was his lack of service in the [[American Civil War]].  Ames had served in the state militia before the war, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel, but resigned before the war began.  Ames countered criticisms by pointing out that he had hired a substitute to serve in his place, and that he had financially supported the Union war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:William Eustis Russell.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[William E. Russell]], portrait by [[William Morton Jackson Rice]]]]
As governor, Ames was a competent administrator, hiring and promoting more on the basis of merit than politics.  He advocated the improvement of public schools, as a counter to private religious schools.  In his second term, he donated $1,000 to the [[College of the Holy Cross]], which upset anti-Catholics in the state and cost him votes in the third election against [[William E. Russell]].  He was also unpopular with [[Temperance movement in the United States|advocates of temperance]]; although he supported the work of the Massachusetts Temperance Society, he was opposed to the legislated prohibition of alcohol.&lt;ref name=Purcell255&gt;Purcell, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;  A state constitutional amendment enacting prohibition was passed by the legislature in 1889, but was voted down in the required referendum that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Hennessy, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  A project to expand the [[Massachusetts State House]] was approved during his tenure, and he in 1889 helped lay the cornerstone for its new elements.&lt;ref name=Davis385/&gt;  In 1887 he signed a bill exempting military veterns from recently enacted civil service regulations, earning him the ire of the state's progressives.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'', June 23, 1887&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, his health began to fail, probably due to the strain of office and his business interests.&lt;ref name=Davis386/&gt;  He refused to run for reelection in 1889, continuing a party tradition of three-term governors.&lt;ref name=Purcell255/&gt;  After leaving office, he traveled to Europe several times to relax and recover his health.&lt;ref name=Davis386&gt;Davis, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;  He died at his North Easton home in 1895.&lt;ref name=Davis387&gt;Davis, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family, patronage, and legacy==
Ames married Anna Coffin Ray of [[Nantucket]] in 1860.  The couple had six children;&lt;ref name=Davis387/&gt; [[Oakes Ames (botanist)|Oakes Ames]] (1874–1950), their youngest son, was a well-known American botanist and [[orchid]] expert.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich et al, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  He owned palatial properties in Boston, Martha's Vineyard, and North Easton.&lt;ref name=Purcell256/&gt;

Ames was elected an honorary member of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] music fraternity in 1917, by the fraternity's Alpha Chapter at the [[New England Conservatory]] in Boston. He is the only known member to receive such a posthumous offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss358_bioghist.html|title=Ames Family Papers, 1812–2012|publisher=Smith College|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Easton's public high school (of which he was a major financial backer)&lt;ref name=Purcell256&gt;Purcell, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; is named [[Oliver Ames High School]] in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.easton.k12.ma.us/document_center/OAH/Accreditation_Report.pdf|title=Accreditation Report|publisher=Town of Easton|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also the namesake of the small community of [[Oliver, Nebraska]],&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[Governor Ames|schooner ''Governor Ames'']], one of largest wooden sailing vessels built in the 19th century, and the first oceangoing five-masted schooner on the Atlantic coast (Ames was one the investors in the ship).&lt;ref&gt;Grenon&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with his cousin [[Frederick Lothrop Ames]], Oliver financed many important buildings and landscapes in North Easton designed by architect [[H. H. Richardson]] and landscape designer [[Frederick Law Olmsted]].  Notable among these are [[Oakes Ames Memorial Hall]] and the [[Ames Free Library]], centerpieces of the [[H. H. Richardson Historic District of North Easton]], a [[National Historic Landmark District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|87002598}}|title=NHL nomination for H.H. Richardson Historic District of North Easton|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a patron of sports and the arts, owning [[Booth's Theatre]] in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=Purcell256/&gt; and raising funds to send athletes from the [[Boston Athletic Association]] to the [[1896 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sgan, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Personal Property Securities Register''' ('''PPSR''') is an electronic register that allows security interests in personal property to be registered and searched in accordance with the New Zealand Personal Property Securities Act 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1999/0126/latest/DLM45900.html?search=ts_act_personal+property_resel&amp;p=1&amp;sr=1|title=Personal Property Securities Act 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the Act) and the Australian Personal Property Securities Act 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/0/05083AE887C340DACA257761007AD73B?OpenDocument|title=Personal Property Securities Act 2009|publisher=comlaw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The New Zealand PPSR is maintained by the [[New Zealand Companies Office]], an agency of the [[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment]].
The [[Australian Financial Security Authority]] (AFSA) is the Australian Government agency responsible for administering the Australian PPS Register.

==Electronic register==
The New Zealand PPSR is a wholly electronic register available to the public 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  It provides online searching, registration and maintenance of [[financing statement]]s. The Australian PPS Register commenced operation on 30 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://transact.ppsr.gov.au/ppsr/Home|title=Access the Australian PPS Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Act reformed the law relating to security interests in personal property and established the PPSR.  The PPSR became operational on 1 May 2002.  It replaced a number of existing registers including the Chattels Register, Motor Vehicle Securities Register and the Register of Company Charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppsr.govt.nz/cms/about-us|title=About the New Zealand PPSR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, the Australian Personal Property Securities Act 2009 ("the PPS Act") was passed.  The Australian PPS Act establishes the Personal Property Securities Register ("the PPS Register").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppsr.gov.au/ABOUTTHEREGISTER|title=About the Australian PPSR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australian PPSR became operational on the 30th of January, 2012.  It replaced a number of existing registers including the Australian Shipping Register, New South Wales Register of Encumbered Vehicles, Queensland Register of Encumbered Vehicles, South Australian Vehicle Securities Register, Tasmanian Motor Vehicle Securities Register, Vic Roads Vehicle Securities Register, and Western Australian Register of Encumbered Vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ppsr.gov.au/previous-securities-registers-and-migrated-data|title=Previous securities registers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The PPSR is used by both secured parties (creditors) and consumers.

=== Registration ===
Registering a security interest on the PPSR may give creditors a better chance of recovering a debt if a debtor defaults.

The Act contains rules for determining priority between security interests in the same collateral (see section 66 of the Act). If a creditor does not register a security interest and a debtor is adjudicated bankrupt or is placed into liquidation, secured creditors will be prioritised when payments are made or assets distributed.

=== Searching ===
The PPSR can be used to assess the level of risk that a debtor may represent to a creditor. Before entering into a contractual relationship with a debtor, a creditor may search the PPSR to check whether they may pose a risk.

It possible for potential creditors to:

* Search a debtor to determine whether there are any existing security interests over their collateral, this may mean they have a number of existing debts.
* Search a debtor to identify if the piece of collateral they are offering you as security has been used as security for another party and if so, someone else will have priority over this collateral.
* Search collateral on the PPSR before buying an item. Check to see if the item is encumbered with an existing registered security. If you are purchasing a car, you may search on the registration number or VIN. Alternatively, conduct a debtor search (against the seller of the goods).

Consumers may also search the PPSR before buying an item of personal property to check that there is no money owing. This is particularly important if purchasing a second hand car privately – it is possible to search the PPSR using the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) to check whether there may be money owed (registered security interests) on the vehicle. The PPSR also correlates information from the [[NEVDIS]] (National Exchange of Vehicle and Driver Information System) database&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austroads.com.au/drivers-vehicles/nevdis National Exchange of Vehicle and Driver Information System (NEVDIS)], [[Austroads]]&lt;/ref&gt; to provide write-off history and stolen vehicle data in the form of a PPSR certificate, which can be issued upon successful completion of a serial number (VIN) search.

==The New Zealand Companies Office==
As well as the PPSR, the [[New Zealand Companies Office]] is also responsible for the administration of the following registers:
* The New Zealand companies register and the Overseas companies register.  These are electronic registers that provide the online searching, incorporation and maintenance services for New Zealand registered companies and overseas companies registered to carry on business in New Zealand.
*The Incorporated Societies Register (including charitable trusts).
*The Motor Vehicle Traders Register (MVTR) – an electronic register that contains information on all registered motor vehicle traders, and information about the trader's business, including its physical address.

=== International activities and involvement ===
The New Zealand Companies Office is a founding member of the [[Corporate Registers Forum]] (an international association of corporate registries) and is an International member of the [[International Association of Commercial Administrators]] (IACA).

[[File:Primo Capraro.gif|right|thumb|365x365px|Primo Capraro in 1930, to the left, beside his children and a fellow.]]
'''Primo Modesto Capraro''' ([[Belluno]], Italy, 1873 – San Carlos of Bariloche, Argentina, 1933) was an Italian businessman constructor based in southern [[Argentina|Argentin]]a. He was a pioneer in the trade, the industry and the tourism of the region of [[Bariloche|San Carlos of Bariloche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Vicente Osvaldo Cutolo|title=Novísimo Diccionario Biográfico Argentino|volume=Tomo I|edition=Elche|year=2004|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
He studied in the industrial school of his home town and loaned military service like pontonier, devoting since, to carpentry and construction. He promised marriage to his girlfriend Matilde for after a trip to Latin America, where he would try to enrich himself quickly; after failing on his attempt in [[Mexico]], [[Santiago|Santiago of Chile]] and the [[Mendoza, Argentina|city de Mendoza]] – where he worked for a rail company – he traveled to the region of [[Bariloche]] to look for gold.&lt;ref name="DRN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.rionegro.com.ar/arch200109/s30j09.html|title=Hace 69 años se suicidaba Primo Capraro|publisher=Diario Río Negro|author=Juárez, Francisco N.|accessdate=30 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrived to the zone of [[Nahuel Huapi Lake|lake Nahuel Huapi]], in April 1903, and installed himself in the lake Correntoso. There he devoted to carpentry and to the construction in wood, and was the constructor of the greater part of the first houses of [[Bariloche|San Carlos of Bariloche.]] When he gathered sufficient capital, he founded the Commercial Company and Grazier Chile Argentina and created a fleet of small crafts to cross the lake.&lt;ref name="DRN"/&gt;

Of impotent appearance, he was high and, blond, weighed almost 130 kg, and impressed to the scarce travellers that visited the isolated region by his initiative and his decision, since he did not use defend himself by force of the abuses of the English company that had the greater part of the earths of the zone.&lt;ref name="DRN"/&gt;

Between his employees he had a Swiss youngster, [[Otto Meiling]], that began the manufacture of [[Skiing|skis]] and initiated the practice of this sport in Bariloche.&lt;ref name="DRN"/&gt;

He was the founder of the Pension Mrs. Rosa, that over time would turn into the Hotel Correntoso, base for the tourist development of [[Villa La Angostura|Villa]] La angostura, place that also owes his starts to Capraro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://revistaroomin.com/nota_hotel_correntoso.php|title=El llamado del bosque|publisher=Revista Roomin|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decade of 1920, almost all the economic and political activity of Bariloche went through Capraro, that was consul of Italy in the region, member of the Municipality, representative of several banks and insurance company, in addition to [[YPF]].&lt;ref name="LAD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laangosturadigital.com.ar/v3/home/interna.php?id_not=24090&amp;ori=web|title=Hace 79 años moría Primo Capraro|publisher=La Angostura Digital|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis of 1930 left it to the edge of the ruin, and the elections of this year deprived it of the absolute control of the local politics that had exerted until then.&lt;ref name="DRN"/&gt; Even so, he had time to associate with other local employers to open the radiotelegraph office of Villa La Angostura on 15 May 1932, date in that it considers founded the current city.&lt;ref name="LAD"/&gt;

He supposedly killed himself On 4 October 1932.&lt;ref name="DRN"/&gt;

A square in Villa La Angostura, an avenue and a small monument in the city of Bariloche, and the most ancient private school of Bariloche honour with his name the memory of this pioneer.

'''Revenue assurance (RA)''' is a niche business activity most commonly undertaken within businesses that provide [[telecommunication]] services.
The activity is the use of [[data quality]] and process improvement methods that improve [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]s, [[revenue]]s and [[cash flow]]s without influencing demand.  This was defined by a TM Forum working group based on research documented in its Revenue Assurance Technical Overview [http://www.tmforum.org/browse.aspx?catid=865&amp;linkID=30508].
In many telecommunications service providers, revenue assurance is led by a dedicated revenue assurance department.

==Overview==
"Revenue assurance" is a broad umbrella term.  It is used both to describe an activity performed within telecommunications service providers, and is a common name for a small business unit associated with that activity.  Revenue assurance is a practical response to perceived or actual issues with operational under performance, most commonly relating to billing and collection of revenue.  Some of the procedures associated with identifying, remedying or preventing errors may be undertaken by a dedicated Revenue Assurance department, though responsibility for revenue assurance is often diffuse and varies greatly with the organizational structure of the provider.  Assuming a provider with a typical organizational split, responsibilities for revenue assurance primarily sit between the Finance and Technology directorates, however, revenue assurance initiatives are often started in a business unit or marketing group.

The relevance to Finance rests with the responsibility for financial control, audit and reporting, while the subject matter would be network and IS systems as implemented or operated by the Technology side of the business.  Marketing groups and / or business units (e.g. wholesale or retail business lines) will often embark on revenue assurance projects in an effort to improve product line margins.  Furthermore, marketing and business units are pivotal in providing input into the "should be" state of customer bills and products.

The sphere of influence described by revenue assurance varies greatly between telecommunications service providers, but is usually closely related to back office functions where small errors may have a disproportionately large impact on revenues or costs.  The processing of transaction data in modern telecommunications providers exhibits many attributes akin to a [[complex system]].  However, there is significant disagreement about the ultimate aims and legitimate scope of revenue assurance teams.  This is in part caused by:

(1) the cross-functional nature of the activity and the consequent need for a variety of skills from IT, marketing, finance, et al.;

(2) the difficulty of generalizing across businesses with different objectives and business models;

(3) political infighting within each telco about responsibility for revenue leakages and assurance; and

(4) the difficulty in reliably measuring the value added by revenue assurance as separable from underlying performance.

There is high-level agreement between practitioners about the goals and methods of revenue assurance, though reaching a consensus on defining the boundaries of revenue assurance has proved elusive so far.  The goals relate to improving the financial performance by eliminating mistakes in the processing of transaction data.  Some take a more encompassing view of what counts as a mistake, which may extend as far as questioning the policy set by executives even when this has been executed correctly.  Others take a more open-ended view of the data that is the subject matter.  For example, in decreasing order of frequency, revenue assurance may cover:

(1) revenues from retail and corporate sales;

(2) revenues and costs from interconnect and wholesale contracts; and

(3) margins and profitability of investment in networks and information systems.

Other markets have different or more refined priorities.  For example, in the U.S.A. management of wholesale contracts has often been the first objective because of the complexity of the domestic market resulting from the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s regulatory framework.  In contrast, telcos in developing countries may prioritize management of international interconnect arrangements because of the risks posed by fraud and arbitrage.  A cable supplier or [[internet service provider]] that predominantly offers retail customers flat monthly charges and no limits on usage may be most interested in assuring the profitability of network investments.

Revenue assurance is often regarded by practitioners as a low-cost mechanism to generate significant financial returns for telecommunications service providers.   However, the returns are unpredictable as well as being hard to measure, which encourages many executives to take a sceptical view of its worth.  Comparable revenue assurance activities do occur in other industries, such as with billing of utilities or with the licensing of software, and there are many parallels with financial and operational control activities undertaken by most large businesses.  The rationale for why revenue assurance has come to be considered particularly important in telecommunications, unlike other industries, is disputed.  Reasonable conjectures are that:

(1) the fast pace of change and intense commercial competition increase the likelihood of mistakes;

(2) there is significant complexity in determining the combined effect of interacting systems and processes; and

(3) the high-volume, low-value nature of transactions amplifies the financial implications of "small" errors.

Another conjecture is that revenue assurance is a response to changing market conditions.  The thinking is that as markets reach saturation and growth potential falls off, so the value of maximizing returns from existing sales increases.  This observation has some merit but does not explain the increasing popularity of revenue assurance in telcos serving growth markets.  It also in part contradicts the assumption of a compelling costs versus benefits argument for revenue assurance, which would be enhanced in businesses undergoing rapid change.  It is also important to recognize that there is a long history of revenue assurance activities in some telcos that predates the coining of the term "revenue assurance".

The revenue assurance techniques applied in practice cover a broad spectrum, from analysis and implementation of business controls to automated data interrogation.  At one end of the spectrum, revenue assurance can appear very similar to the kinds of review and process mapping techniques applied for other financial controlling objectives like accounting integrity, as exemplified by those derived from clause 404 of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]].  This form of revenue assurance is most commonly promoted by consultancies.  The size of such consultancies covers the entire range; the Big 4 all offer some form of revenue assurance consulting, but there are also niche specialist consultancies.  At the other end of the spectrum, revenue assurance is treated as a form of reactive automated data interrogation, seeking to find anomalies in transaction data that may indicate errors and potential revenue loss.  This form of revenue assurance is most commonly promoted by software houses that aim to provide databases and configurable tools to extract and interrogate a telco's source data.  A less popular form of reactive automated assurance involves using both software and specialised hardware as a means of extracting additional data on transactions, for example by creating actual network events or interfacing directly with network elements to replicate dummy events.  As with consultancies, IT-oriented revenue assurance solutions are offered by both large vendors like providers of billing and mediation software, and by specialized niche providers.

There is some debate about the relative merits of the different techniques that can be employed in revenue assurance.

As yet, there is no professional body, no qualifications, and no academic research that would help to drive consensus about the purpose or methods of revenue assurance.  In part this is addressed by individuals working in the sector through membership and qualification in related fields such as accountancy and information systems audit.  Some scientific research in other fields is also applicable to revenue assurance, though most revenue assurance "facts" rely heavily on anecdotes and oft-repeated truisms.  Some of the most helpful and progressive initiatives in addressing the problem of consensus and scientific basis are listed below.

==The value of revenue assurance==
Revenue assurance is usually understood as a means to identify and remedy, and perhaps also to prevent, problems that result in financial under performance without seeking to generate additional sales.  The most common metaphor is that of leaking water from a pipe, where water stands in place of revenues or cash flows, and the leaks represent waste.  The value of revenue assurance is hence determined by the size of the leaks "plugged", and possibly also those leaks prevented before they occur, although estimating the value of the latter is very problematic.  The value added also includes the recovery of "lost" revenues or costs (through issuing additional bills, chasing uncollected payments, renegotiating with suppliers a refund of costs etc.) after the fact.  This last form of reactive revenue assurance is the easiest to put a value to, but is in many ways the least efficient form of revenue assurance; effort is directed towards repeatedly addressing the consequences of known flaws, and not on addressing the flaws themselves.  This can lead to a parasitical relationship between a Revenue Assurance department or vendor and the wider business, where the department/vendor finds it easiest to justify its ongoing existence/contract by repeatedly fixing symptoms and not the root causes.

The TM Forum conducted a benchmark survey in 2008 that concluded average leakage, not including losses due to fraud, was 1% of the gross revenues for those telcos that took part.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tmforum.org/TMForumPressReleases/RevenueAssuranceStudy/36002/article.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of participating telcos was relatively small compared to some other surveys, but the survey technique was more demanding than any comparable survey to date.  The survey used the most detailed and prescriptive definition of how to calculate leakage of any survey of its type.  The definition was taken from the TM Forum's own standard on how to calculate revenue assurance metrics [http://www.tmforum.org/DocumentsRevenue/GB941ARevenueAssurance/33545/article.html].  To increase confidence that participants calculated their leakages correctly, the TM Forum's benchmark program independently reviewed the results and corroborated them with representatives of the participating companies.  The survey's average of 1% leakage of gross revenue, whilst still significant, is notably lower than many other quoted estimates and reported survey findings about average leakage.  This may be because the survey used a very strict definition of leakage. The survey measured only actual under-billed and unbilled amounts discovered by the participants; it excluded other types of leakages such as cost leakages and loss of opportunity leakages, and it excluded projected leakage estimations that are commonly used (i.e., what would have been the amount of leakage, if the leakage would not been discovered by revenue assurance activities).  It may also reflect a reduction in bias or exaggeration in reported leakages, or at least the exclusion of guesswork.  Respondents were given authoritative instructions on how to quantify leakage based on actual data and were instructed to avoid making suppositions in the absence of such data.

The best known estimates of "typical" revenue leakage come from a series of annual surveys conducted by the Analysys consultancy and research business. In these surveys, leakage was commonly estimated as being worth between 5% and 15% of the total revenue of the business.  Similar research by other businesses has generated results in the same range, with none concluding leakage of less than 1% of gross revenue, and some suggesting leakage of 20% or more was not uncommon.  Reasons to doubt these estimates are as follows:

(1) All the estimates of leakage were derived from the subjective opinions of staff working in service providers;

(2) All the research was conducted by businesses wishing to promote their revenue assurance products;

(3) Increased annual spend on revenue assurance has not resulted in a clear downward trend in estimates;

(4) The estimates were broadly similar even when the criteria for what losses to include varied greatly; and

(5) Genuine losses of this scale should be a severe corporate governance issue in any publicly listed business.

What can be said with some confidence is that revenue assurance practitioners are able to provide a vast number of consistent anecdotes relating to the causes of leakage and means to resolve them.  Though there is little objective evidence relating to actual leakages approaching this scale in the public domain as this information per se is highly confidential, there are some indirect measures of data integrity that help give a sense of potential leakage.  For example, in reconciling interconnect costs and revenues between telcos, a 5% variance is the common practice to accept before a disputed invoice can lead one party to withhold payment, and a 0.5% variance would be considered industry-leading practice according to best practice advice issued by the [http://www.revenueassurancegroup.net/ UK Revenue Assurance Group].

==Revenue Assurance in Telecom==
Although Revenue Assurance has always been present in the telecom parlance{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} it has recently been brought at the forefront of the top management{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}. This is due to several factors including
* Profit: Increasing cost pressures and decreasing margins.  The high profit days for most telcos are over{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}. They all need to find alternative means to squeeze higher margins by effectively tracking their revenue. 
* Regulatory: New regulatory structure and compliance requirements{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} which force the telecom operators to report their revenue accurately.
* Technology Innovation: Ensuring new technologies and products are performing as per perceived plans. Keeping up with release of new technologies along with co-existing of legacy systems.
* Mergers and Acquisitions: With increase in the number of telco mergers and acquisitions, organizations are finding it very difficult handle multiple BSS systems including Billing, Mediation and Rating together etc. 
Revenue Assurance has been a problem for the telecom companies since the very early stages. Tracking of pulses, minutes, counts, bytes etc. has never been more difficult. One would think these would be easy for the tech-savvy telco companies. However, the truth has been just the opposite. In a hurry to release new technologies in the market, the Revenue Assurance systems are always lagging behind. Revenue Assurance in a telco environment covers a wide range of technical and business aspects. An RA operator needs to be aware of both OSS &amp; BSS processes and internal dependencies to accurately decipher the revenue code.

===What causes the problem ===
A telecom organization's revenue chain is usually a very complex set of inter-related technologies and processes providing a seamless set of services to the end consumer. As the set of technologies and business processes grows bigger and more complex, the chance of failure increases in each of its connections. A revenue leakage is typically attributed to when a telco organization is unable to bill correctly for a given service or to receive the correct payment. As the organization grows the probability of revenue leakage only increases.

===Where is the problem ===
The most debated part of revenue assurance is where to start checking, i.e. at the network side, the rating side, the billing side, the interconnect side, the CRM side, etc. However, most surveys and reports state that the maximum leakage happens during the flow of Call Detail Records (CDRs) or Event Detail Records (EDRs) from the Switch to the respective rating / billing engines. Some of the common problem areas are :		
* Network	
   * Signaling problems
   * CDRs in Switch not sent to Mediation	
   * CDRs in Mediation not send downstream	
   * CDRs rejected by rating / billing system
   * Wrong duration on the CDRs
   * Wrong TON value populated in the CDRs
   * Incorrect Business rules
   * Subscriber provisioning
   * Incorrect Routing
* Rating &amp; Billing
   * Incorrect Rejection Logic
   * Duplicate CDRs resulting in double charging
   * Incorrect tariff plans
   * Rating &amp; Billing accuracy errors
   * Late rating / billing
   * Incorrect configurations – rating minutes instead of seconds
   * Incorrect Disconnection

==Revenue assurance as a discipline==
Among the disciplines in revenue assurance are:

1. The CORE functions of a revenue assurance group: Monitoring, Baselining, Auditing, Synchronizing, Investigating and Compliance.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Decomposing an organization's revenue assurance scope (The Revenue Management Chain).&lt;br/&gt;
3. Assessing and minimizing revenue loss risk.

==Maturity of Revenue Assurance==

There is no formal maturity model for Revenue Assurance which is universally accepted. However the Revenue Assurance processes can be pegged against a generic five stage maturity model. The five stages are listed below and are described in terms of a Revenue Assurance Strategy, People, Process and technological advances.

[[File:RA maturity.JPG|thumb|Revenue Assurance Maturity Stages]]

* Initial: At this level that they are (typically) un-documented and in a state of dynamic change, tending to be driven in an ad hoc, uncontrolled and reactive manner by users or events. This provides a chaotic or unstable environment for the Revenue Assurance processes. At this stage there is no formalized Revenue Assurance strategy in place. Teams run adhoc queries on various systems. It depends entirely on personal ideas &amp; initiatives. It encompasses substantial manual effort. There are undocumented repeat processes.
* Repeatable: At this level that some processes are repeatable, possibly with consistent results. Process discipline is unlikely to be precise. This is where the Revenue Assurance functions starts to take some shape in defined procedures and outputs. However they still don’t cover the entire revenue spectrum of the telecommunications company nor do they cover all aspects of a specific revenue stream. People are still learning the skill set of revenue assurance. There are specific measurement and analysis outcomes received at this stage.	
* Defined: At this level that there are sets of defined and documented standard Revenue Assurance processes established and subject to some degree of improvement over time. These standard processes are in place (i.e., they are the AS-IS processes) and used to establish consistency of process performance across the organization. There are specific tools for Revenue Assurance identified and implemented. There is clear sense of what revenue chain coverage does, what the Revenue Assurance department cover and road maps are in place for the future. All major revenue streams are covered by now. There is a formalized and approved Revenue Assurance charter and strategy in place. There is a specific year on year budget for the department.
* Managed: At this level with the use of process metrics, management can effectively control the Revenue Assurance AS-IS process (e.g., for Issue Detection, Root Cause Analysis, Closure). There is a formalized strategy and long term road map for people, process and technology for the revenue assurance department.  In particular, management can identify ways to adjust and adapt the process to particular Revenue Streams without measurable losses of quality or deviations from specifications. Process Capability is established from this level. The people have the right skill set to execute daily operations and have subject matter expertise.
* Optimizing: At this level that the focus is on continually improving process performance through both incremental and innovative technological changes/improvements. A risk based strategy is in place to evaluate the coverage of Revenue Assurance at specific intervals of time. Controls reach a maturity where Revenue Assurance only acts as an improvement agency for other process areas including product development, product deployment, customer retention, billing, collections, dunning etc. At this stage the RA processes are concerned with addressing statistical common causes of process variation and changing the process to improve process performance.

==RA Process Categories==

The Revenue Assurance processes in many ways can be regarded as an auditing process. The objective is to ensure that policies of the organization are well implemented and that no or minimal revenue leakage is occurring. The RA processes have the capability to cover all departments and service lines in a telecommunications organization. There are many ways in which RA processes can be classified, however in view of an audit function; the RA processes can be categorized into Detective, Corrective and Preventive activities, controls or processes.  Let's understand the difference with the help of an example. Supposing the objective is to ensure trunk groups correctly entered in the MSCs. The detective control would be to monitor Trunk Groups appearing in CDRs are harmonized with the master list and any deviations are reported. The corrective control would be to initiative a process and confirm with the Network / Wholesale team of all deviations found. The preventive control would be to set up a process with the Network / Wholesale team where all new trunk groups are first informed to the RA, Mediation, Wholesale and other essential departments and then made live on the Network.

===Detective Processes===

Revenue Assurance Detection is the process of spotting a change in value of a dimension relative to its movement from System A to System B or within a given systems itself. The change in the value is relative to a dimension is question. Detection in RA can be achieved by both manual and automated means. Typical detection activities include monitoring, summarization, investigation and auditing.
* Monitoring: Typically monitoring activities in Revenue Assurance refers to observing data, system or a process for any changes which may occur over a period of time. With the use of automated tools one can typically achieve constant monitoring which can notify the user or administrator (via email, SMS or other alarms)  in case of any changes. The various processes which typically are monitored by a Revenue Assurance department include daily network usage, profile and configuration changes, mediation, rating, billing, settlement, roaming, collections and dunning related processes. 
* Summarization: When dealing with large volumes of information like network usage, it may not be practical to go through CDR by CDR and compare the same between 2 systems. In such cases summarization will help in quickly examining and finding out the preliminary problems areas. For example, one could first summarize information on the basis of few dimensions like events ( voice, sms, data), customer type (postpaid, prepaid, in roamer, out roamer), operator (self, local, national, international)  etc. and compare the measures like count and duration of these dimensions between 2 systems. Such rapid assessments help in identifying the problem areas or dimensions quickly and a further detailed investigation can be carried out for those dimensions identified. Summarization greatly reduces the manual effort in identifying problem areas within a large data stream. 
* Auditing: A revenue assurance audit is a set of activities carried out to ensure that the organization is taking necessary steps to remain compliant to the evolving changes of organizational policies, regulations and market conditions. Every Revenue Assurance audit has a list of specific objectives which may come from management, regulations or industry standards. The actual tasks of the audit can differ based on the information, system or departmental processes being audited. Some sample RA audit objectives could be like ensuring billing accuracy up to 0.01%, no configuration variances on the Network, rating &amp; invoicing process assurance etc. Each RA audit can span into different departments, each with its own specialized technical requirements.  
* Investigation: Investigation is the act of detecting something new, or something "old" that had been unknown. Investigation leads to discovery which is the observation of new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered.  An RA investigation is a series of processes or procedures carried out to identify the Root Cause of an anomaly. This is also known as Root Causes Analysis (RCA) procedures or activities.  Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a method of problem solving that tries to identify the root causes of faults or problems that cause operating events. An investigation would try to identify and correct the root causes of events, as opposed to simply addressing their symptoms. By focusing on correction of root causes, revenue assurance problem recurrence can be prevented.

===Corrective Processes===

Correction is the set of activities and processes related around getting the process structures correct in order to minimize the changes identified as per the detection techniques. Correction itself is the act or method of correcting a discrepancy. Typically some information, configuration, amount or quantity needs to be added, edited or removed from a system, process or procedure in order to correct the anomaly. In Revenue Assurance activities, the process of correction of a root cause could involve correction of information, processes, technology or people. 
* Information Correction: This refers to the process of correcting or updating a value for a configuration element or a reference table.  This is typically the result of a missing data set in a particular given table or system file. For example, a particular number series may be missing in the Switch and hence not getting connected or updating a missing tariff plan in rating engine leading to unrated CDRs etc. 
* Process Correction: Process correction refers to the modification of an activity by adding, modifying or removing an activity step which will prevent a miss-configuration or revenue leakage in the process. Typically process correction is required to have a pro-active revenue assurance step to provide better governance across the operations.  For example, the pre-bill verification process may be required to be modified when a new service line or product is introduced into the market. The new service line may be required to be included within the pre-bill process.
* People Correction: People correction is required when skills of the resources are in question. Revenue Assurance is a niche business process with limited people present with the right amount of Telecom Network, Mediation, Billing, IT and Business related experience. This leads to many Revenue Assurance teams with inexperienced people on operational departments. Owing to this, most Revenue Assurance operations end up being only re-active rather than moving into a proactive foundation.
* Technology Correction: The very nature of the telecom business changes frequently. There are 2 aspects to Technology correction i) The technology on the Network side ii) Technologies in use by the RA department themselves. 
Telecom Network technologies evolve at a rapid pace. Sometimes technologies need to be balanced in the Network. For example, having multiple vendors on the Network side could lead to a requirement of having time synchronizer equipment installed just to have CDRs showing consistent time and date related information.   
Any current implementation of Revenue Assurance becomes obsolete rapidly.  As technologies evolve revenue assurance tools and coverage of the tools also need to evolve.  This essentially means technology corrections need to be performed either on the hardware side or on the tool / application side. Technology corrections are rare and need to be performed with due diligence as technology corrections can be very expensive to an organization.

===Preventive Processes===

Prevention is the process of performing an activity in order to avoid a high risk situation. It is essentially an action carried out to de-risk a threat.  For example, if there is risk that a tariff plan is not correctly implemented, then the preventive action could be to simulate calls on test SIMs on the new tariff plans prior to launch and confirm the tariffs coming in the test CDRs against the marketing or advertising  department rates. Preventive activities lead to effective risk management around Revenue Assurance. 
* Synchronization - A set of activities which ensure that 2 data sets are synchronized over a period of time. For example, a set of Revenue Assurance activities would ensure that all prepaid customers on the CRM systems are represented in the IN - SDP (Intelligent Network) and vice versa. Similarly all trunk groups between the whole sale departments are in sync with the trunk groups mentioned in the MSCs.  Another example could be to ensure all B number tables between the MSCs are same.
* Integrity Checks - These are individual activities carried out to ensure the integrity of the system or process. This is an effective check in gaining insight into an individual process and to assess whether it has anything in their immediate background that may be a cause for concern.  For example, performing a sample based credit check for postpaid customers prior to generation of a bill.  Another example could be subscriber checks with sanction lists watch lists for involvement in/association with fraud, money laundering &amp; related illegal activities.
* Pre Process Checks - Any checks performed on the input parameters of a process to ensure that the right data is fed into the process. Pre Process checks are necessary for complex processes like rating and billing which involve multiple sub processes and consume a lot of time for each run. Some sample preprocess checks could include validation of CDR sequence number before rating, file count confirmation before rating, subscriber pre check before billing, duplicate CDR check, report all postpaid customers that do not have the correct bill cycle etc.
* Post Process Checks - Post process checks are required to verify the reliability on the outputs of a given process. Some processes of Revenue Assurance can produce multiple co-related outputs which need to be verified before being released to the consumer either internally or externally. Some examples of post process checks are formats checking on the target outputs like TAP 3 files, cross reference subscribers on the bill cycle with pre bill list, numbers terminated directly on OSS systems and not via CRM / BSS systems etc.

==Tool for Revenue Assurance==

Since Revenue Assurance is a very niche area in the telecommunications environment, there are some specific products and solutions supporting this subject. There are various vendors in the market which address either the complete suite of Revenue Assurance requirements or specialize in the specific domains.  This section describes the basic features of a generic Revenue Assurance tool.

One must keep in mind that software RA solutions can only help in pointing toward the error locations or problem areas. When one addresses the question of developing an RA solution they need to consider the magnitude, scope and capacity of the systems available along with the intellect, skills, and the number of people accessible. Finally it is the people, their skills and knowledge that make a complete RA solution. An organization should be careful when automating revenue assurance as it may end up with an expensive and inflexible solution which no one can manage effectively.
There are a variety of specialized RA products which have different characteristics including probing, RA add on modules on respective OSS / BSS elements. However the most common tool adopted by most Telecommunication companies is one which can simulate the natural process of the CDR flow from Network generation to Invoicing.  Given below are some of the requirements (not exhaustive) of such a Revenue Assurance product.

===Extract, Transform and Load===

Telecommunications is an environment where there are many heterogeneous systems creating a multitude of data. Typically a single day’s information runs into many Giga Bytes or in some cases Tera Bytes also. This creates a need to have very proficient and rigorous extraction, transformation and loading tool for a Revenue Assurance application. Some of the common features of this tool are:

*It should be able to import data in all common formats of data (ASCII, ASN, BCD, Binary etc.) 
* It should be able import data directly from common databases 
* It should have the ability to receive data feeds from various data sources of the Network, Operational and Business support systems
* It should have an extensive audit log to track files and records status - received, processing, duplicate, loading, error etc.
* The solution must provide an integrated environment to perform data integrity checks
* It should be configurable using a user friendly GUI.
* It should provide the ability to normalize, enrich and transform business rules as applicable into a data model 
* It should be able to look up large tables or files for reference information
* It should enable the creation of new data fields by manipulating and calculating values based on other fields 
* It should provide the capability to monitor the progress and success of the whole ETL process from start to end
* It should handle unexpected errors and continue processing and maintain the appropriate audit logs
* It should support full automation of the ETL procedure from file pick up to record entry in the DB or file system.
* It should have the ability to store historical summary and detail information for a period of time configurable by the user
* It should be able to summarize information on the fly based on configurable dimensions
* It should have the ability to configure ETL level alarms and thresholds on data and notify relevant users of any exceptions
* The solution must be highly scalable so that the data processing platform can be sized to accommodate current and projected, with business growth, traffic volumes &amp; audit points.

===Reconciliations===

One of the primary focus areas of a Revenue Assurance tool is to compare CDRs or XDRs from 2 different sources and checking if all the records from the first system have transferred properly to the second system keeping the appropriate business rules in consideration. This is achieved via comparative analysis of the records between the 2 systems either at the details record level or summary level by evaluating the common dimensions between the 2 data sets. Given below are some of the requirements (not exhaustive) which a Revenue Assurance Reconciliation side of the product should provide.	

* It should have a graphical user interface to enable the RA analysts to create/update reconciliation and business rules 
* It should support various reconciliation and controls rules types e.g. missing records, unmatched records, problems in source file (duplicates, invalid values) 
* It should be able to filter the data prior to the rule executing to ensure efficient system operation 
* It should be able to set effective start and end date from which a newer business rule will be applied and valid for.
* It should be to define rules using a naturalized user friendly language or a “drag and drop” GUI.
* It should be able to associate monetary values with discrepancies identified based on predefined business rules
* It should support the creation of a hierarchy of rules, when the results of a rule can become a source for further rules definition.

===Analysis and KPIs===

Once all the information has been received into the Revenue Assurance systems it time to crunch numbers and generate reports. The critical part is the analytical capabilities of the tool. The tool needs to have the ability to make sense of the problems in the vast set of data that it has gathered. This can only be done by a high performance analytical engine which should be capable of the following activities (non exhaustive):

* It should have the capability to create measures based on the output of selected reconciliation and control rules and/or other user-definable criteria e.g. Customer Account Number, Product Code 
* This tool should be able to create alerts based on the application of thresholds to measures and dynamically change the thresholds based on business logic
* It should be able to create KPIs based on various measures (such as count, sum, average, etc..) and multiple dimensions. 
* It should be able to showcase trends based on KPI values over the period of time and raise alarms when thresholds are crossed (for example alarms could be raised on a) Zero duration CDRs; b) Short duration calls; c) Long duration calls; d)Duration discrepancies; e) Invalid structure code/call types etc.)
* It should be able to forecast information based on past records and raise alarms or reports
* Users should be able to set thresholds of KPIs on the total value as well as on the value per specified dimension, e.g. the system should be able to alert on the situations when the threshold per a specific attribute is violated. 
* It should be able to categorize alerts and alarms based on priorities (e.g. critical, major, minor) 
* It should enable users to create new, and update and delete existing, KPIs and measures at any time through a simple graphical user interface. This should include full KPIs definition – calculation, dimensions, thresholds, calculation frequency. 
* The solution must have the ability to support detection, investigation, validation and correction of discrepancies resulting from audit comparisons
* It should be able to co-relate gaps in the reconciliations with missing profile information or missing reference information or other system errors and prepare a consolidated report.

===Dash boarding===

A Revenue Assurance dashboard is an easy to read, often single page, real-time user interface, showing a graphical presentation of the current status (snapshot) and historical trends of an organization’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to enable instantaneous and informed decisions to be made at a glance. For example, a prepaid dashboard may show KPIs related to prepaid CDRs reconciliation, prepaid user profile reconciliation, balance reconciliations and voucher reconciliations carried out in real time or near real time.

* It should be able to provide a fully personalized dashboard screen to present concise summary and/or detailed information 
* It should be composed of ‘building blocks’ or ‘sections’, each containing valuable information for the user e.g. summary of all currently defined dimensions &amp; measures 
* It should allow different building blocks to display the information of different types (e.g. grid tables, trend graphs, bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, gauges, URLs, Maps etc..). 
* It should enable each block or section to be linked on a functional level e.g. once a user selected a specific gauge, for example, in one building block, a specific relevant pre-defined table or graph in other building block(s), is being refreshed accordingly, to reflect the selection of the user 
* It should provide information on each source on the dashboard with drill down capabilities to investigate detailed information related to the building block whether presented with textual of graphical means 
* It should provide a designer module with full flexibility in defining data sources based on any information type stored in the RA database as well as the ability to use external information sources 
* It should enable users to search on a predefined set of fields within the source data for records using a complex combination of logical operators e.g. “=”, ”&lt;”, ”&gt;”, including wildcards 
* It should provide drill down capabilities from the list of records resultant from a search into specific record details.

===Case Management===
A case management capability in Revenue Assurance should be able to provide a 360 degree view of a given case. The tool should be able to track and resolve the identified discrepancies. The tool should handle each “case” in the system from the point where the system detected it, and manage follow up through the correction and reclamation processes, until the case is resolved. Based on a discrepancy in one given area, It should be able connect relevant information from various sources. For example, if a CDRs reconciliation has a problem, the case tool should be able to co-relate with respective user profiles, non-usage information, credits risks, network configurations etc.  The case management component may have some of the following non exhaustive capabilities:

* Ability to create a unique case identification reference for each discrepancy (or group of discrepancies) where user-defined criteria are met 
* It should enable users to manage and track cases by updating different case’s attributes such as: Status, Value, Priority, Assignee, Description, etc. 
* The user should have a full case history mechanism associated with cases and the case details. The history should be kept throughout the case life cycle including when the case is reopened by the system 
* It should be completely user-definable with content based on any data field available in the RA database by a simple drag and drop mechanism 
* It should enable users to include in case details all case related information and also any additional information (not necessarily case related) that can help in case analysis 
* It should enable users to create new fields in the case that will include either the automatically calculated value or will be opened for the user update. These fields should retain their value throughout the case life cycle 
* It should support case report output manipulation including sorting, multi-level grouping and filtering based on any one of the displayed attributes 
* It should have the ability to “multi-assign” cases (such as changing the assignee or closing a large number of cases) to one another
* It should enable users to print the displayed discrepancies and export them to Excel, Word, Csv and PDF etc. files with restrict user access so that they can only see and update only the cases that are assigned to them

==Pre-war life and career==

He had one older brother, [[Sven Dysthe|Sven]], and the younger siblings Gunnar, Ingeborg and Helge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalarkivet.arkivverket.no/ft/person/pf01036392099998 1910 Census]&lt;/ref&gt; He [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in 1921, and took his education abroad, in commerce, wine and liquor production.&lt;ref name=merkbio/&gt; He started a business career together with his brother Sven.&lt;ref name=nkl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Dahl|first=Hans Fredrik|authorlink=Hans Fredrik Dahl|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl, Hans Fredrik]]|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]]|title=Dysthe, Roald (1903—) og Sven (1901—88)|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/d/d3.html#dysthe-roald|accessdate=24 February 2010|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|volume=|location=Oslo|isbn=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810021546/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/d/d3.html#dysthe-roald|archivedate=10 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1928 to 1930 they were involved in a major public case. On 4 May 1928 they wrote a letter to the [[Mowinckel's Second Cabinet|government]], complaining that the state semi-monopoly [[Vinmonopolet]] disfavorized their father's wine importing agency [[Dysthe &amp; Co]]. A scrutiny commission was set up to review Vinmonopolet's business practice. Vinmonopolet, on the other hand, sued the Dysthe brothers to have the complaints declared [[Void (law)|null and void]], but a year later, in April 1930, Vinmonopolet lost the legal case. The Dysthe brothers' defender was [[Ole Røed]]. The case became a major scandal in the media as Vinmonopolet's role was unveiled. The board chairman [[Hans Halvorsen]], who was a brother-in-law of the Prime Minister [[Johan Ludwig Mowinckel]], had to resign together with board member [[Trygve Wettre]] and three employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skandalen som rystet Polet|last=Salvesen|first=Geir|date=29 November 2003|work=[[Aftenposten]]|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulateig, 1993: pp. 15–27&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s the brothers were active in the Norwegian-Third Reich friendship society [[Norsk-Tysk Selskap]].&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Sørensen|first=Øystein|authorlink=Øystein Sørensen|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl, Hans Fredrik]]|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]]|title=Norsk-Tysk Selskap, NTS|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/n/n4.html#norsk-tysk|accessdate=24 February 2010|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|volume=|location=Oslo|isbn=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301185754/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/n/n4.html#norsk-tysk|archivedate=1 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in [[McKesson &amp; Robbins]].&lt;ref name=aft93&gt;{{cite news|title=Frikjent for hard landssvikdom etter mange år|last=Storvik|first=Olav Trygge|date=8 November 1993|work=[[Aftenposten]]|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a board member of Dysthe &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=merkbio/&gt;

==World War II==
After [[Operation Weserübung|Nazi Germany invaded Norway]] on 9 April 1940, and [[Vidkun Quisling]]'s party [[Nasjonal Samling]] (NS) became the only legal party, Dysthe sided with the German occupiers. He intrigued in order to weaken NS, and had contacts in the ''[[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]]''. At the same time he was a member of NS, although he claimed the reason for his membership was to [[Informant|inform]] the Germans about party affairs.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; Among others, he contributed to the downfall of [[Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie (Nazi)|Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie]] as president of the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NRK).&lt;ref name=p297&gt;Dahl, 1978: p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Christie was a Norwegian nationalist and Quisling supporter,&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, 1978: pp. 294–295&lt;/ref&gt; and as Dysthe was a special supervisor in the NRK from September 1941 he reported Christie to the ''Reichskommissariat'', who fired him. NRK had earlier been scrutinized by police inspector [[Gard Holtskog]]; however he advised to keep Christie and to limit the German influence.&lt;ref name=p297/&gt;

From 28 September 1940 Dysthe was also the chief executive of the company Nordisk Radio-Press.&lt;ref name=p297/&gt; He also owned one share of stock.&lt;ref name=p318&gt;Dahl, 1978: p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Norwegian News Agency]] also had one share, but Nordisk Radio-Press took over the News Agency's task of delivering news to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. Historian [[Hans Fredrik Dahl]] has referred to Dysthe's company as a "pure parasite". It bought news from the Norwegian News Agency, and sold this expensively to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation without changing it. Members of the company's supervisory council were paid refunds for meetings that were never held.&lt;ref name=p318/&gt; Dysthe was also behind the merger of the [[broadcast programming]] magazines ''[[Hallo-Hallo!]]'' and ''Radiobladet'' into ''Norsk Programblad'' in 1940.&lt;ref name=p319&gt;Dahl, 1978: p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, 1978: p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Nordisk Radio-Press was the publisher of ''Norsk Programblad'',&lt;ref name=p319/&gt; but it went bankrupt in 1941 when the authorities confiscated all radios (except for those belonging to Nasjonal Samling members).&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, 1978: p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

Dysthe had a personal campaign against cabinet member [[Albert Viljam Hagelin]]. In 1944 Dysthe intrigued and advised the ''Reichskommissariat'' to depose Quisling and his [[Quisling's Second Cabinet|cabinet]]. For this Dysthe was excluded from Nasjonal Samling, and imprisoned.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; He was incarcerated in [[Bredtveit concentration camp]] from November 1944, then in [[Berg concentration camp]] from January 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Kristian Ottosen|Ottosen, Kristian]]|title=Nordmenn i fangenskap 1940–1945|edition=2nd|year=2004|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=82-15-00288-9|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war life==
After the war, when the Nazis were ousted and the [[legal purge in Norway after World War II]] took place, Dysthe was released from prison but subsequently convicted for [[treason]] in September 1946. He was sentenced to six years of [[forced labour]], {{NOK|320,000}} payable in compensation and the loss of his civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dagbladet for 50 år siden|date=26 September 1996|work=[[Dagbladet]]|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later [[Acquittal|acquitted]] for treason in 1950, and moved to [[Canada]] in 1951.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; This was not uncontroversial as he probably contributed to the saving of many Norwegian lives, both by persuading German forces to enforce milder penalties, but also by leaking information.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt;&lt;ref name=aft93/&gt; He received compensation from the [[Parliament of Norway]] in 1984. In 1993 the newspaper ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' called him a "war hero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Helten som forlot Norge|first=Børre|last=Haugstad|author2=Solberg, Trond |date=8 November 1993|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time he was still living, in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Ulateig, 1993: p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Established on June 16, 2007, the '''SME Infocomm Resource Centre''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''SIRC'''), is a [[not-for-profit organisation]] that seeks to help Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) in Singapore to advance their use of Info-Communications Technology (ICT).

Launched in 2007 by then [[Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (Singapore)|MICA]] minister [[Lee Boon Yang|Dr Lee Boon Yang]], the vision behind SIRC was for Singapore SMEs to become active users of ICT technologies, and to help them to use the Internet to improve their operations and market their companies at home and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mica.gov.sg/pressroom/press_070619.htm Launch of SIRC and Infocomm@SME Programme]&lt;/ref&gt; The first SIRC (SIRC@SP) at [[Singapore Polytechnic]] is jointly created by [[Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore|IDA]] and [[Singapore Polytechnic]].

The SME Infocomm Resource Centre is modelled after organizations such as the [http://www.mirc.org.my/ MIRC], [http://actetsme.info APEC Center for Technology Exchange and Training for SMEs] and [http://www.apec-smeic.org/ APEC SME Innovation Centre]

SIRC seeks to reach out to existing SMEs and new Start-up SMEs in Singapore through a series public workshop programmes. In addition, the SIRC assists SMEs by providing technical resources to companies embarking on innovative and prototype ICT applications. Local industries have been encouraged in several minister speeches&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mica.gov.sg/pressroom/press_070816.htm Speech By Dr Lee Boon Yang At Singapore Chinese Chamber Of Commerce And Industry’s 11th Infocomm Commerce Conference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mica.gov.sg/pressroom/press_071008.htm Speech By Dr Lee Boon Yang, Minister For Information, Communications And The Arts, At The 72nd Anniversary Dinner Of The Singapore Metal And Machinery Association]&lt;/ref&gt; to take advantage of the services by the SIRC and other government assistance schemes.

== Key Programmes ==
The SIRC@SP is involved in several key initiatives under the Infocomm@SME programme by the [Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore]. A recent IDA survey (circa 2006) showed that more could be done to help Singapore ’s small &amp; medium enterprises, or SMEs, tap the power of infocomm technology. IDA had launched a new Infocomm@SME programme. This programme is not just to equip SMEs with basic ICT know-how. Infocomm@SME is aimed at helping SMEs to explore the latest ICT technologies and solutions to transform and enhance their businesses.

=== SIRC Workshops ===
The SIRC Workshops are an important means to achieving the mission of the SIRC. The workshops are conducted by industry experts in various fields. The topics of the workshops include:
* Creating business value using Web 2.0
* Infocomm Security
* E-Commerce and E-Payment
* Improving Business Operations through Accounting Software.
* Search Engine Marketing

=== SIRC Application Jumpstart ===
IDA’s survey of SMEs found that many local SMEs faced difficulties in starting innovative projects because of the high cost of manpower in Singapore. Many SMEs also face difficulties in recruiting and keeping talented technical staff. The SIRC helps to bridge the gap by providing technical expertise to help in project implementations. Funding for such projects can come from [[SPRING Singapore]]. [http://www.business.gov.sg/EN/Government/GovernmentAssistance/index.htm Government assistance] includes funding from SPRING Singapore under the LETAS and TIP programmes.

The '''Samuel J. Friedman Theatre''' (formerly the '''Biltmore Theatre''') is a [[Broadway theatre]] located at 261 West [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th Street]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

==History==
Designed by architect [[Herbert J. Krapp]] for [[impresario]] [[Irwin Chanin]], the theatre opened on December 7, 1925, with the play ''Easy Come Easy Go''. With a seating capacity of 903, it was one of Broadway's smaller venues.

The theatre was used by [[Federal Theatre]]'s [[Living Newspaper]] project in the 1930s. [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] leased it for use as a radio and television studio from 1952 until 1961. The producer David Cogan acquired the Biltmore in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/nyregion/david-cogan-a-raisin-in-the-sun-producer-dies-at-78.html| title=David Cogan, 'A Raisin in the Sun' Producer, Dies at 78| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=February 24, 2002| accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the groundbreaking [[rock musical]] ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' opened at the theatre.

In 1986, Cogan sold the Biltmore to developer Samuel Pfeiffer in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/01/theater/biltmore-theater-s-owner-rejects-5.25-million-offer.html| title=Biltmore Theater's Owner Rejects $5.25 Million Offer| date=April 1, 1989| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, a fire struck the Biltmore. The blaze, which was later determined to be an act of [[arson]], destroyed the interior. After the fire, the building sat vacant for fourteen years, suffering more structural damage from water and vandals. Most plans proposed for its future use – such as a showcase for "Best of Broadway" revues – were rejected since its [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City landmark]] designation required it to operate only as a legitimate Broadway house if renovated. In 1993, the [[Nederlander Organization]] and [[Stewart F. Lane]] acquired the Biltmore; after being unable to secure a deal with theatre unions, the theatre was sold to developer [[Joseph Moinian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/24/theater/nederlanders-and-partner-buy-the-biltmore-theater.html| title=Nederlanders and Partner Buy the Biltmore Theater| last=Dunlap| first=David W.| date=July 24, 1993| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/18/nyregion/43-story-hotel-planned-over-shuttered-biltmore-theater.html| title=43-Story Hotel Planned Over Shuttered Biltmore Theater| last=Foderaro| first=Lisa W.| date=April 18, 1997| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the theatre was assumed by the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] as a permanent home for its productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/12/nyregion/dawning-of-a-new-age-for-the-biltmore.html| title=Dawning of a New Age for the Biltmore| last=Dunlap| first=David. W.| newspaper=The New York Times| date=December 12, 2001| accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Polshek Partnership Architects restored surviving sections of the original theatre and [[EverGreene Architectural Arts]] restored plasterwork and reconstructed missing parts. With 622 seats the new Biltmore has about two-thirds of the capacity of the old venue, although it now boasts modern conveniences such as elevators and meeting rooms. The Biltmore's landmarked features, such as the proscenium arch, dome, staircases and a vaulted second-floor gallery, were restored or replicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David W. |last=Dunlap |title=For Venerable Theater, It's a Body Transplant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/23/theater/for-venerable-theater-it-s-a-body-transplant.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |quote=Time was when the Biltmore reminded people of ''Hair'', ''Barefoot in the Park'', ''My Sister Eileen'' and ''Deathtrap''; of George Abbott, a co-owner who used it as a showcase; Jean-Paul Sartre, whose ''No Exit'' was staged there; and Mae West, whose ''Pleasure Man'' brought in the police. |newspaper=The New York Times| date=September 23, 2003 |accessdate=2011-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was renamed the "Samuel J. Friedman Theatre" in a dedication ceremony held on September 4, 2008. The new name honors Broadway publicist [[Samuel J. Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Jones| first=Kenneth| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/120950.html| title=Broadway's Biltmore Becomes the Friedman on Sept. 4| journal=[[Playbill]]| date=September 4, 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906222313/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/120950.html| archivedate=September 6, 2008| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manhattan Theatre Club took ownership of the Samuel J.

'''Service science and service engineering''' is an area of [[expertise]] which can be placed at the interface of [[software service]] systems and new globe-spanning [[business]] processes. It is especially relevant to disciplines which involve both business and [[information technology]].  A master course that focuses on [[service engineering]] and service science is the International Master in Service Engineering (IMSE).

==Service Science==
[[Service science, management and engineering]] has developed in response to the need to combine [[technology|technological]] and non-technological [[innovation]]s in a rapidly growing environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tilburguniversity.nl/eriss/about/&lt;/ref&gt; The term covers [[research]], scientific projects, and innovative forms of education.
The discipline addresses the service sector's unique problems by using various approaches. It focuses on [[Information and communication technologies for environmental sustainability|ICT]], business, management, [[industrial engineering]], socio-legal sciences, and economics. The innovative creation of value for both customers and shareholders is the heart of this interdisciplinary approach.

A 'service-dominant' approach is starting to take over from the traditional goods-dominant approach. Some key factors of this service-dominant approach are:
1.	the realisation of a service as a process;
2.	a focus on dynamic resources, such as [[knowledge]] and skills
Service science stresses global economic developments such as [[globalization]], competition, outsourcing, and interdependence.

==What is meant by ‘services’?==
A 'service' can be described as: all intangible effects that result from a [[Customer|client]] interaction that creates and captures value.&lt;ref name="tilburguniversity.nl"&gt;http://www.tilburguniversity.nl/eriss/research/service/&lt;/ref&gt; Services are everywhere in today's world. The sector ranges from common [[intangible goods|'intangible' goods]], such as health and education, to newer goods, such as modern [[communications]] and IT. Services are said to be essential to increase productivity and growth, and are considered salient to the development of knowledge-based economies. The growth of the service sector is in part a response to the change of traditional manufacturing industries into services. Many modern services combine both products and services, and the distinction between the two has blurred. However, a number of typical shared characteristics still distinguish services from goods-producing sectors. These include a clear focus on knowledge and ICT, ever-changing business processes, and unique [[finance|financial]], regulatory and [[investment]] structures.&lt;ref name="tilburguniversity.nl"/&gt; Service industries also cover a large variety of business types, from travel to highly knowledge-intensive services, such as [[global communication]] networks and specialized financial services.&lt;ref name="tilburguniversity.nl"/&gt; In general, knowledge-intensive services encompass both professional services (e.g. financial, legal), and [[science]] and technology-linked services (e.g. environmental, mining, health).

==Why is service engineering important?==
The explosive growth in services worldwide is seen as the next major revolution in the [[world economy]]. As service economies continue to expand and powerful digital communications networks – such as the [[Internet]] – evolve rapidly, companies are transforming from regional businesses to globally integrated enterprises. With the ever-increasing use of the Internet around the world, [[service network]]s and [[cloud computing]] will be key ingredients for this generation. The fast-growing discipline of service engineering is related to service economy growth and the global need for service innovation. Research and education in this field are therefore in high demand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6884">The '''Systemic Risk Council''' was formed in 2012 by [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] and [[CFA Institute]] to help ensure the effective implementation of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] and related measures related to mitigating [[systemic risk]].

==Charter==
''“This new council is composed of experts with a thorough understanding of the issues, and we are pleased to support their efforts to find nonpartisan and independent recommendations. The reforms to our nation’s financial system enacted by Congress and signed by the president in 2010 were an important first step. The task now is to implement these reforms, especially those related to systemic risk.”'' '''Rebecca W. Rimel, president and CEO of The Pew Charitable Trusts'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rimel|first=Rebecca|title=Press Release|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=85899396370|work=Press Release|accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''“Despite the magnitude of the financial crisis, prospects for major reform of regulatory systems are inadequate and vague ”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=John|title=Web Site Article|url=http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/marketintegrity/2012/06/06/cfa-institute-co-sponsors-systemic-risk-council-led-by-former-bank-regulator-sheila-bair/|work=CFA Institute|accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''John D. Rogers, president of the CFA Institute''' 
*''“The great challenge is to devise a system to identify risks that threaten market stability before they become a danger to the general public. As evidenced by the 2008 crisis and even recent headlines, we need a more effective and efficient early-warning system to detect issues that jeopardize the functioning of U.S. financial markets before they disrupt credit flows to the real economy. And two of the most critical tasks are how to impose greater market discipline on excess risk taking and effectively end the doctrine [[too-big-to-fail]].”'' '''[[Sheila Bair]], chair of the Systemic Risk Council.''' 
* *''“nothing has been finalized. [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] is M.I.A. [[Office of Financial Research]] is barely functional. The [[Volcker Rule]] is mired in controversy. [[Securitization]] reform is stalled. They haven’t even proposed new bank capital rules. The public is becoming cynical about whether the regulators can do anything right, which is undermining support for reforms.”'' '''[[Sheila Bair]], chair of the Systemic Risk Council.''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Group Forms to Urge Strict Oversight of Wall Street|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/business/new-systemic-risk-council-to-press-for-stricter-financial-regulations.html?_r=2|newspaper=NYT|date=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plans==
The council issued a call to action on June 18, 2012 at The Pew Charitable Trusts in Washington, D.C., detailing the objectives and future plans for the Systemic Risk Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Systemic Risk Council is a 'Strong, Independent Voice' to Help Implement Financial Reforms |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/analysis/2012/06/18/systemic-risk-council-is-a-strong-independent-voice-to-help-implement-financial-reforms |work=The Pew Charitable Trusts |accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Our overriding concern stems from the lack of progress made by the members of the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] (FSOC) and the [[Office of Financial Research]] (OFR) to address several critical issues as mandated by the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (Dodd-Frank), enacted in 2010. That concern increases each day that the implementation of systemic risk reform languishes. A sense of complacency has made reforms for effective oversight seem less urgent despite escalating problems elsewhere in the global financial system. In many ways, the financial system faces larger potential challenges today than it did in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, given the troubled state of the [[European Union]] and uncertainties at home related to fiscal and monetary policy.  It is essential that the FSOC show leadership in coordinating the rule-writing process to promote the development of cohesive, consistent regulations and provide clear and transparent explanations of the reforms in a way that is understandable to the general public. We have created this Council to assist in that effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Systemic Risk Council: A Call to Action |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2012/06/18/src_call_to_action_061812.pdf |work=Systemic Risk Council |format=PDF |accessdate= 11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workmanship''' is a human attribute relating to knowledge and skill at performing a task. The type of work may include the creation of [[handcrafts]], [[art]], [[writing]], [[machinery]] and other products.  Workmanship is also a [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] imparted to a product.

==Workmanship in society==
Workmanship is considered to have been a valued human attribute even in prehistoric times.  In the opinion of the economist and sociologist [[Thorstein Veblen]], the sense of workmanship is probably the single most important attribute governing the material well being of a people, with only the parental instinct coming a close second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Veblen|1914|loc= Chpt 1: Introduction |quote = "Chief among those instinctive dispositions that conduce directly to the material well-being of the race, and therefore to its biological success, is perhaps the instinctive bias here spoken of as the sense of workmanship." }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have however been periods in history where workmanship was looked down on; for example in [[Classical Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], where it had become associated with slavery. This was not always the case - back in the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]], Greeks had valued workmanship, celebrating it in [[Homeric hymns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sennett|209|loc= pp. 22-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the western world, a return to a more positive attitude towards work emerged with the rise of Christianity.&lt;ref name="Rasmussen 2008 loc= Chpt 2: Work Curse or Blessing"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rasmussen|2008|loc= Chpt 2: Work Curse or Blessing }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, Veblen considers that the social value of workmanship reached its peak with the "Era of handicraft". The era began as workmanship flourished with the relative peace and security of property rights that Europe had achieved by the [[Late middle ages]]. The era ended as machine driven processes began to displace the need for workmanship after the [[Industrial revolution]].  Workmanship was such a central concept during the handicraft era, that according to Veblen, even key theological questions about God's intentions for humanity were re-framed from "What has God ordained?"  to "What has God wrought?".&lt;ref name="Veblen 1914 loc= Chpt 6: The era of handicraft"&gt;{{Harvnb|Veblen|1914|loc= Chpt 6: The era of handicraft }}&lt;/ref&gt;    The high value placed on workmanship could sometimes be an oppressive force for certain individuals - for example, one explanation for the origin of the English phrase [[sent to Coventry]] is that it was born from the practice where London [[guild]] members expelled due to poor workmanship were forced to move to Coventry, which used to be a guild free town.  But workmanship was still widely appreciated by the [[common people]] themselves.&lt;ref name="Veblen 1914 loc= Chpt 6: The era of handicraft"/&gt; For example,  when workers accustomed to practicing high standards of workmanship were first recruited to work on production lines in factories, it would be common for them to walk out, as the new roles were relatively monotonous, giving them little scope to use their skills.  After [[Henry Ford]] introduced the first [[Assembly line]] in 1913, he could need to recruit about ten men to find one willing to stay in the job. Over time, and with Ford offering high rates of pay,  the aversion of labor to the new ways of working was reduced.&lt;ref name = "soulCraft"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Workmanship began to receive considerable attention from scholars once its place in society came under threat by the rise of industrialization. The [[Arts and Crafts movement]] arose in the late 19th and early 20th century, as workmanship began to be displaced by developments like greater emphases on process, machine work, and the separation of design and planning skills from the actual execution of work.  Scholars involved in founding the movement, like [[William Morris]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[Charles Eliot Norton]], argued that the opportunity to engage in workmanship used to be a great source of fulfillment for the working class.&lt;ref name="Veblen 1914 loc= Chpt 6: The era of handicraft"/&gt;   From a historical perspective however, the arts and crafts movement has been seen as a palliative, which unintentionally reduced resistance to the displacement of workmanship.&lt;ref name = "soulCraft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson Lear 1994 loc= Chpt 2: The figure of the artisan: arts and crafts ideology"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackson Lear|1994|loc= Chpt 2: The figure of the artisan: arts and crafts ideology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book written on the nature of workmanship, [[David Pye (furniture)|David Pye]] writes that the displacement of workmanship has continued into the late 20th century. He writes that since World War II especially, there has been "an enormous intensification of interest in design", at the expense of workmanship. The trend started in the 19th century has continued, with Industrial processes increasingly designed to minimize the skill needed for workers to produce quality products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pye|1968|loc= Chpt 1: Design proposes: Workmanship disposes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 21st century scholars such as [[Matthew Crawford]] have argued that office and other white collar work is now being displaced by similar technological developments to  the ones that caused large numbers of manual workers to be made redundant from the late 19th to early 20th century. Even when the jobs remain, the cognitive aspects of the jobs taken away from the workers, due to knowledge being centralized.  He calls for a revaluing of workmanship, saying that certain manual roles like mechanics, plumbers and carpenters have been resistant to further automation, and are among the most likely to continue offering the worker the chance for independent thought.&lt;ref name = "soulCraft"/&gt; Writers like [[Alain de Botton]] and [[Jane McGonigal]] have argued that the world of work needs to be reformed to make it more fulfilling and less stressful. In particular, workers need to be able to make a deeply felt imaginative connection between their own efforts and the end product.  McGonigal argues that computer games can be a source of ideas for doing this; she says the primary reason for [[World of Warcraft]] being so popular is the sense of "blissful productivity" that its players enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Botton|2010| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McGonigal|2011|loc= Chpt 3: More satisfying work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workmanship and craftsmanship===
[[File:Rubens - Vulcano forjando los rayos de Júpiter.jpg|thumb| [[Peter Paul Rubens|Ruben's]] 1536  rendition of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], the  Roman counterpart of [[Hephaestus]], the Greek God of Craftsmen.]]    
Workmanship and Craftsmanship are sometimes considered synonyms, but many draw a distinction between the two terms, or at least consider craftsmanship to mean "workmanship of the better sort".&lt;ref name="Pye 1968 loc= Chpt 2: The workmanship of risk and the workmanship of certainty"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pye|1968|loc= Chpt 2: The workmanship of risk and the workmanship of certainty }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who do consider  workmanship and craftsmanship to be different, the word "workmanlike" is sometimes even used as a pejorative, to suggest for example that while an author might understand the basics of their craft, they lack flair. David Pye has written that no one can definitively state where workmanship ends and craftsmanship begins.&lt;ref name="Pye 1968 loc= Chpt 2: The workmanship of risk and the workmanship of certainty"/&gt;

{{cquote|Sing clear-voiced Muse, of Hephaestus famed for skill. With bright-eyed Athena he taught me glorious crafts throughout the world - men who before used to dwell in caves in the mountains like wild beasts. But now that they have learned craftsmanship through Hephaestus famous for his art they live a peaceful life in own houses the whole year round.}}
- an extract from a Homeric hymn celebrating craftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Sennett (2009) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, smiths and especially armor smiths developed unique symbols of workmanship&lt;ref&gt;Ffoulkes, John. The Armourer and His Craft: From the XIth to the XVIth Century. Dover, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish the quality of their work. These became some of the most unusual signs of workmanship, comparable to the ''mon'' family crests of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuya Piece-Goods Store. Japanese Design Motifs: 4,260 Illustrations of Japanese Crests. Dover, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workmanship and aversion to labor===
It has often been held in older economic writings that people are always adverse to labor and can only be motivated to work by threats or tangible rewards such as money. While Christianity has generally been positive about workmanship, certain Bible passages such as Genesis 3:17 ("...Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.") have contributed to the view that labor is a necessary evil, part of the punishment for [[original sin]],&lt;ref name="Rasmussen 2008 loc= Chpt 2: Work Curse or Blessing"/&gt; but work existed before original sin and the [[fall of man]] in Genesis 2:15 ("Yahweh God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.") The view that work is a punishment takes Genesis 3:17 out of context. God's curse wasn't work, but that work would inherently be harder. Veblen and others agree with this view, saying that work can be inherently joyful and satisfying in its own right. Veblen acknowledges that humans have an innate tendency towards idleness, but asserts that they also have a countervailing tendency to value work for its own sake, as is demonstrated by the vast amount of work that is undertaken without obvious external pressure. As evidence for the widely shared instinct towards workmanship, Veblen also notes the near universal tendency for humans to approve of others' good work. Psychologist Pernille Rasmussen has written that the tendency to value work can become so strong that it stops being a positive source of motivation, contributing instead to some people losing balance and becoming workaholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In November 2014, it was reported that The Business Council along with JR Simplot Co, are examining the possibility of re-opening the Fremont County iron mine. The mine was shuttered in 1983 and was one of the highest employers in the area. The study will examine the cost of reviving the mine along with the benefits of an estimated 150 million to 200 million tons of iron remaining in the old mine.&lt;ref&gt;http://trib.com/business/energy/wyoming-business-council-jr-simplot-co-study-reopening-fremont-county/article_026fea42-7af5-586c-a48b-d323ec4c97a9.html&lt;/ref&gt;
