      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8587">'''Asymmetric negotiation''' is influence that occurs between counterparts of significantly different sizes as measured by the parties’ relative resources and clout in a particular context. The context for these negotiations or conflicts can range from mergers &amp; acquisitions and international trade deals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pretsch|first=Frank|last2=Landau|first2=Alice|title=Symmetry and Asymmetry in International Negotiations|url=https://eduedi.dongguk.edu/files/20070519075111526.pdf|journal=International Negotiation}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to hostage-takings and initiating change at a local school board. 

A larger party in one context can be a smaller party in another. For instance, a US corporation may be a much larger buyer in an asymmetric negotiation with a North American supplier, while reduced to being a relatively small player overseas in negotiations with the [[European Union]] where it has fewer resources and less clout. 

Just as in [[asymmetric warfare]], research has shown that smaller players can prevail in getting what they want from much larger players by applying distinct approaches, strategies and tactics that increase their odds of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://negotiatingwithgiants.com|title=Negotiating with Giants|last=Johnston|first=Peter D.|publisher=Negotiation Press|year=2008|isbn=0980942101|location=United States|pages=1-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This specific form of negotiation contrasts with symmetrical or standard negotiations where the parties are more similar in size.

== History ==
Given the growing number of large corporations and government entities worldwide, and the corresponding growth in asymmetric negotiations, this phenomenon has received increasing attention in recent decades, with numerous journalists and academics addressing the subject in articles and journals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21707210-rise-corporate-colossus-threatens-both-competition-and-legitimacy-business|title=In the shadow of giants|last=|first=|date=|work=The Economist|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haber|first=Lawerence J.|date=Summer 2006|title=Labor Negotiations and Game Theory: The Case of Asymmetric Bargaining Power|url=http://klasrum.weebly.com/uploads/9/0/9/1/9091667/labor_negotiations.pdf|journal=Journal of Collective Negotiations|volume=|pages=|via=Indiana-Purdue University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivanitsky|first=Nicholai|date=November 19, 2014|title=Asymmetric negotiations: a journey in unchartered Waters|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141119083842-182746213-asymmetric-negotiations-a-journey-in-uncharted-waters|journal=Global Intermediate Storage Systems|volume=|pages=|via=LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;. International negotiator [[Peter D. Johnston]]’s book ''Negotiating with Giants'' provides an in-depth survey of “size-imbalanced” negotiations. In this 2008 book, Johnston studied more than 100 negotiations from across history to the present day, where smaller players got what they wanted from much larger players, with the author identifying unique strategies that worked for these “Davids” in their negotiations with wide-ranging giants or “Goliaths.” 

== Asymmetric strategies for smaller players ==
According to Johnston, successful smaller players should change the game on their larger counterparts by using seven distinct approaches given the unique challenges they face in asymmetric negotiations:
#  They should defend themselves from the start, earlier than one might normally expect, including defenses for their reputations, ideas and information to ensure that hurting them won’t be as easy as it could be otherwise.
#  They should negotiate away from the negotiation table as long as possible to even the playing field with larger counterparts, making themselves bigger and stronger before meeting face-to-face—if and only if that is ever required.
#  They should draw on seven different types of “helpers” that smaller players across history have employed to their benefit: Decision-makers, Influencers, Arm-Twisters, Networkers, Allies, Counselors and Informants.
#  They should find rules and laws to undermine larger players&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Robert S.|last2=Silverstein|first2=Elliot M.|date=Spring 2000|title=When David Meets Goliath: Dealing with Power Differentials in Negotiations|url=http://www.hnlr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/WHEN_DAVID_MEETS_GOLIATH_DEALING_WITH_POWER_DIFFERENTIALS_IN_NEGOTIATIONS.doc|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, join them to weaken them from the inside, or remove key assets that contribute to their strengths.
#  They should act unilaterally and unpredictably when it meets their interests, using their smaller size to react swiftly and catch their giants flat-footed, often by pursuing their back-up plans.
#  They should weave together their different negotiations and operating decisions to maximize value in any single negotiation, a strategy referred to by the author as "integrated negotiation".
#  They should think differently about building rapport and trust, focusing on positives that connect them to their giants, modeling desired behaviors, building trust incrementally, and redefining trust by knowing that they can always trust larger players will act consistent with what they perceive to be in their own best interests.

== Historical examples ==
* [[Magna Carta]], the Barons and King John. In 1215, Magna Carta, Europe’s first written constitution guaranteeing basic rights for citizens, was agreed to by King John, but only after the land-owning Barons weakened the Monarch by claiming London as their own. The Barons would only relinquish control of the city once they saw that the Crown had followed through on its commitments related to Magna Carta.
* [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and the [[abolition of slavery in the United States]]. As a housewife and abolitionist in 1851, Stowe wrote the novel ''[[Uncle Tom’s Cabin]]'', drawing attention to the evils of slavery. The book, second only to the Bible in worldwide readership by the end of the 1800s, helped forge a broad coalition of abolitionists, enabling Stowe to influence the creation of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], the choice of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as president, and ultimately, the end of slavery in the United States.
* [[Rachel Carson]] and the [[environmental movement]]. In the 1950s, the scientist uncovered troubling links between bird deaths and pesticides, soon linking cancer to chemical usage and building a coalition of environmentalists through her non-fiction bestselling book, ''[[Silent Spring]]''. Her influence helped lead to the banning of [[DDT]], the establishment of America’s [[Environmental Protection Agency]], and the early development of the environmental movement itself. 

== Contemporary examples ==
* The 1989 [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]] between Canada and the United States. Rather than continuing to negotiate a series of smaller bilateral trade deals by sector, Canada at one-tenth the size of America, reached a wide-ranging trade agreement. The deal was large enough to attract the attention of its southern neighbor, while valuable enough to the Americans to ensure Canada could also negotiate important protections for its culture, healthcare and education.
* ''[[Friends]]'', [[Warner Brothers]], and [[Courteney Cox|Courtney Cox]]. When the ''Friends'' television show quickly became a sensation in the mid-1990s, Cox (Monica), the highest profile member of the cast at the time, could have easily commanded the largest salary increase for herself. Instead, she rallied [[David Schwimmer]] (Ross) and their other four main cast members into a coalition to negotiate as one with more collective clout. This led to the same immediate financial gains for each actor, culminating in each actor being paid $1 million per episode by the end of the show’s run in 2004.
* [[Ashley Smith (author)|Ashley Smith]] and hostage-taker [[Brian Nichols]]. In March 2005, Smith was taken hostage by Nichols in her Atlanta apartment, and managed in fewer than eight hours to build rapport, trust and mutual understanding with the armed killer, reading excerpts from [[The Purpose-Driven Life]] and the Bible, before he let her go unscathed. She was later one of the key witnesses against Nichols, who was found guilty of a range of crimes and sentenced to multiple life sentences.

'''Sūrat Al-Tawbah''' ({{lang-ar|سورة التوبة}}, "The Repentance"), also known as ''Barā'ah'' ("Repudiation"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Study Qur'an|last=Nasr|first=Seyyed Hossein|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2015|isbn=978-0-06-112586-7|location=New York|pages=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the ninth chapter of the Qur'an. It contains 129 verses and is one of the last Medinan chapters. It is the only ''sūrah'' of the Qur'an that does not begin with the [[basmala]]. This ''sūrah'' was revealed at the time of the [[Battle of Tabuk]].

Verse 37 documents the prohibition of [[Nasi'|nasīʾ]], the calculation of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] for the [[lunar calendar]] by the priests of the [[Banu Kinanah]] tribe of the [[Quraysh]]. This prohibition was repeated by Muhammad during the [[Farewell Sermon]] on [[Mount Arafat]], which was delivered during the [[Farewell Pilgrimage]] to Mecca on 9 [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] AH 10.

According to [[Zayd ibn Thabit]], when the Qu'ran was first being compiled, he found the last verses of this ''sūrah'' in the possession of [[Khuzaima ibn Thabit|Abu'l-Khuzayma al-Ansari]] and no one else.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Muḥammad ibn Ismāʻīl Bukhārī]], [https://books.google.it/books?id=yp9RLUAS8zsC&amp;pg=PT1727  ''Sahih al-Bukhari,''] Peace Vision, 1971 p.1727.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Peters]], [https://books.google.it/books?id=KnAO36Jh6bMC&amp;pg=PA180  ''A Reader on Classical Islam,''] Princeton University Press 1993 p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; In another account, [[Ubay ibn Ka'b]] informed Zayd that the Prophet taught him the end of this ''sūrah'' and recited the same verses.&lt;ref name="Imam"&gt;Ahmad Ali Al-Imam, [https://books.google.it/books?id=R2iYf0bvYGwC&amp;pg=PA29 ''Variant Readings of the Qurʼan: A Critical Study of Their Historical and  Linguistic Origins,''] International Institute of Islamic Thought, 2006 pp.28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, like [[Ibn Hazm]], suggested that Abu Khuzayma was the only one to have the last verses in written form, as Zayd and others had memorized them.&lt;ref name="Imam" /&gt;

At-Tawba also features [[At-Tawba 29|Verse 29]], a verse that appears to promote [[jihad]] against "people of the Scripture" and as such is a subject of much debate.
==Exegesis==
In [[Kitab al-Kafi]], [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] has narrated that Imams are not needy to what people own but rather collect religious tax on accord that Allah said '''9:103 Take from their wealth (religious tax) and charity by which you purify them and cause them increase and invoke blessings upon them.''' Therefore, it is the people who need that the Imam accept from them. &lt;ref name="Kulayni"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kitab al-Kafi|last1=Al-Kulayni|first1=Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ya’qub|date=2015|publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc.|isbn=9780991430864|location=South Huntington, NY|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''''Biblioteca Nacional de Chile''''' is the [[national library]] of [[Chile]]. It is located on the [[Avenida Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins]] in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], in a building completed in 1925, though its history reaches to the early nineteenth century before it was relocated to its current home.

== History ==
[[File:Auroradechile-01.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Aurora de Chile]]'', Chile's first newspaper, is kept at the Biblioteca Nacional.]]
The Biblioteca Nacional is, together with the [[Instituto Nacional]] and a small number of institutions, one of the first institutions created by the newly formed Republic of Chile in the [[Patria Vieja]] period. In the newspaper ''[[El Monitor Araucano]]'', a ''Proclama de Fundación'' ("Proclamation of Foundation") of the Biblioteca Nacional was published on August 19, 1813. With this vision, a call was made to all the citizens to submit their books for the formation of one great public library. As with other republican institutions, the library was closed after the [[Disaster of Rancagua]], in which the national troops were defeated by the army of the ''[[realistas]]''. With the victorious [[Battle of Chacabuco]], it was reopened and supported by the government, and started to receive important collections. The [[Supreme Director of Chile]], [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], named professor [[Manuel de Salas]] as the first director of the Biblioteca Nacional. In 1822 Friar [[Camilo Henríquez]] (director of the ''[[Aurora de Chile]]'') newspaper was named as the second head librarian.
 
Since its creation, the library had been a dependency of the [[Universidad de San Felipe]] and its successor, the [[Universidad de Chile]], until it gained autonomy in 1852. In 1913, upon its 100th anniversary, the Biblioteca Nacional acquired the ''Monasterio de Santa Clara'', located on the Alameda de las Delicias on present-day [[Cerro Santa Lucía]]. At the creation in 1929, the library was made into a dependency of the ''[[Dirección de Bibliotecas, Archivos y Museos]]''.

== Location ==
[[File:Sala Gabriela Mistral de la Biblioteca Nacional de Chile.jpg|thumb|Chilean Hallroom (Sección Chilena) of the Biblioteca Nacional de Chile]]
Since 1925, Biblioteca Nacional has been situated in the centre of [[Santiago, Chile]]. It was formerly located in the square where now stands the ''Teatro Municipal de Santiago'' ([[Municipal Theater of Santiago]]).

Construction of the present building began in 1913. It was commissioned as one of the commemorative public works in honour of the first [[centenary]] of the independence of Chile. The building boasts an imposing façade of columns and arches, of very pronounced French [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] influence. The library shares its building with the [[Archivo Nacional de Chile]] (the National Archive). Adjoining the building is the [[Santa Lucía metro station]], and to the east is [[Cerro Santa Lucía]].

The interior, spread out over two main levels and a basement, has been embellished and decorated with carved marble staircases, sculptures and paintings from some of the country’s classic artists, such as [[Alfredo Helsby]] and [[Arturo Gordon]].

== Collections ==

The Biblioteca Nacional has an extensive and valuable collection of books and manuscripts. Several of these were acquired from or donated by their owners, making up an important national historical treasure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisischile.cl/8990/2/chilean-national-library-a-captivating-historic-treasure/News.aspx] www.thisischile.cl  Friday, November 08, 2013, retrieved November 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The most important collections include:

'''Black suffrage''' is  [[Black people]]'s [[right to vote]]. Black suffrage has been at issue in countries established under conditions of [[white supremacy]]. It may be limited through official or informal (''[[de facto]]'') discrimination. In many places, black people have obtained suffrage through national independence. It should also be pointed out that "Black suffrage" in the [[United States]] in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]] explicitly refers to "Black Male Suffrage".  While women citizens, regardless of race, held rights to vote in some states, at the federal level, the U.S. Constitution was not interpreted to prohibit discrimination against women in voting, regardless of their race, until the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] which was ratified by the [[United States Congress]] on August 18 and then certified by law on August 26, 1920.

* Beginning in [[Simon de Montfort's Parliament|1265]], a small number of landed aristocrats and gentry had the right to vote for members of the [[Parliament of England]] and Knights of the Shire. From 1432, only [[forty-shilling freeholders]] held the parliamentary franchise. Suffrage was restricted to males by custom rather than statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The History of the Parliamentary Franchise|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP13-14|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=1 March 2013|chapter=Ancient voting rights|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Olaudah Equiano]] and the [[London Corresponding Society]] (founded 1792) argued for expanded suffrage. ''Also see:'' [[Radicalism (historical)]].
* The [[Reform Act 1832]] extended the vote to landed middle class men.
**Incremental reform continued with various [[Reform Act]]s, 
**The [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] ended property qualification for male suffrage.

==France==
* Before the Revolution, only some local elections were held, the first real national suffrage appeared in 1791. 
* From 1791, France installed several male suffrage system, alternating between census and universal suffrage. In mainland France, there was no racial criterion to be a voter so technically from this date, Black (male) voters existed and received the same rights as non-Blacks. They were still rare as segregation on France was not based directly on skin color or racialism but on the status as a slave or as a free human. Later it would be based on status as a mainland citizen or as a colony citizen.
* From there, through the first half of the 19th century, frequent changes in the national government caused the colonies (where most slaves were, as their presence was restricted in mainland France) to have different rules than mainland France, often illegally. Several uprising occurred in the colonies during this period and the colonial rules diverged considerably from mainland France.
* In mainland France:
** In 1794 the government abolished slavery.
** In 1802 Napoleon Bonaparte re-established slavery and, possibly owing to his disagreements with [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas]], a black general, forbade Blacks and people of mixed-ancestry (''mulâtres'') to enter mainland France.
** In 1815 slave trade was abolished, but not slavery
** In 1848 slavery is formally abolished in France and all slaves are freed.
* In the [[French Colonial Empire]], however, most indigenous people were not recognized as full French citizens and therefore often did not have the right to vote: 
**[[Vincent Ogé]], who had been working in Paris during the Revolution, returned to the island slave colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] and demanded voting rights. Ogé led an insurrection in 1790 and was executed in 1791. Enslaved people took control of the island in the subsequent [[Haitian Revolution|Revolution]] and established the Republic of [[Haiti]]. (Elections were held but [[History of Haiti#Independence: The early years .281804.E2.80.931843.29|the democracy was not stable]].)
**France promoted a [[Assimilation (French colonial)|model of assimilation]] according to which Blacks and indigenous people could gain voting (and other) rights by successfully conforming to French culture. These high-status Blacks were known as ''les [[Évolué]]es''.
** People living in French colonies primarily fell under the ''[[Code de l'indigénat]]''. ''Les'' ''indigènes'' had some voting privileges, but these could be modified without their consent.
**Following the Revolution of 1848, France granted limited representation to the [[Four Communes]] of Senegal. Ordinary residents of these cities gained full voting rights in 1916 after the election of [[Blaise Diagne]].
** [[Lamine Guèye]] (another Senegalese politician) also achieved expanded voting rights ("''loi Lamine Guèye''") for people in the colonies.
**Residents of African colonies were permitted to vote in the [[French constitutional referendum, 1958]], which established the [[French Community]]. Most colonies voted for independence, resulting in the creation of 17 Black nations in the [[Year of Africa]].

==Belgian Congo==
* Blacks in the Belgian Congo voted for the first time in [[Belgian Congo#Political Organization|municipal elections of 1957]].
* The first nationwide election was the [[Belgian Congo general election, 1960]]. ''See also:'' [[Mouvement National Congolais]]
* The assassination of elected President Patrice Lumumba led to years of crisis followed by the Zaire dictatorship. The next free, multi-party election was the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006]].

{{Politics of Libya|constitution}}
The '''1951 Libyan Constitution''' was brought into force on 7 October 1951, prior to Libya's formal declaration of its independence on 21 December 1951 as a constitutional and hereditary monarchy under [[King Idris]]. The enactment of the Libyan Constitution was significant in that it was the first and only piece of legislation that formally entrenched the rights of Libyan citizens after the post-war creation of the Libyan nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Chronology of International Events and Documents, Royal Institute of International Affairs. Vol. 7, No. 8 (5–18 April 1951), pp. 213-244&lt;/ref&gt;

The Libyan National Assembly drafted the Constitution and passed a resolution accepting it in a meeting held in the city of Benghazi on Sunday, 6th Muharram, Hegiras 1371: October 7, 1951. [[Mohamed Abulas’ad El-Alem]], President of the National Assembly and the two Vice-Presidents of the National Assembly, [[Omar Faiek Shennib]] and [[Abu Baker Ahmed Abu Baker]] executed and submitted the Constitution to [[King Idris]] prior to its publication in the Official Gazette of Libya.

The enactment of the Libyan Constitution was significant in that it was the first piece of legislation to formally entrench the rights of Libyan citizens following the post-war creation of the Libyan nation state. Following on from the intense UN debates, during which Idris had argued that the creation of a single Libyan state would be of benefit to the regions of Tripolitania, Fezzan, and Cyrenaica, the Libyan government was keen to formulate a constitution which contained many of the entrenched rights common to European and North American nation states.

Following the "Green Revolution" military coup of 1969, led by Colonel [[Gaddafi]], that overthrew the monarchy and the Libyan National Assembly, the Libyan Constitution was no longer in effect. [[The Green Book (Libya)|''The Green Book'']] put forth by Gaddafi became the foundation of the laws of Libya.

==Constitution of the Kingdom of Libya==

The Constitution of the Kingdom of Libya included a Preamble and twelve Chapters outlining the protection of human rights in Libya and regulating the nature and functions of the institutional apparatus of the Libyan State. Law N. 1 of 1963 abolished Chapter 3 and Articles 173, 174, and 175, thereby suppressing the Federal Regime originally established by the 1951 Constitution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://democracy-reporting.org/dri_publications/briefing-paper-28-assessment-of-the-1951-libyan-constitution/|title=Briefing Paper 28: Assessment of the 1951 Libyan Constitution|work=Democracy Reporting International is a non-partisan, independent, not-for-profit organisation registered in Berlin|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 1 of the 1951 Constitution defined the “Form of State and System of Government of the Country”, while Chapter 2 described the “Rights of People”. Chapter 3, repealed in 1963, included a first section regarding the “Powers of the Federal Government” and a second section pertaining to “Joint Powers.”

Chapter 4 organized the Libyan State’s “General Powers” arrangement, further articulated in Chapters 5 through 8 (“The King”; “The Ministers”; “Parliament”, including three sections regulating “The Senate”, “The House of Representatives”, and “Provisions Common to the Two Chambers”; “The Judiciary”).

Finally, Chapter 9 through 12 discussed Libya’s “Fiscal System” (as amended in 1963), the “Local Administration”, as well as “General Provisions” and “Transitory and Provisional Provisions.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Preamble==
The Preamble to the Libyan Constitution sets out the terms under which the union of the regions of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan into Libyan came about:

''In the name of God the beneficent, the merciful.
''We, the representatives of the people of Libya from Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan, meeting by the will of God in the cities of Tripoli and Benghazi in a National Constituent Assembly. Having agreed and determined to form a union (1) between us under the Crown of King Mohammad Idris el Senussi, to whom the nation has offered the Crown and who was declared constitutional King of Libya by this the National Constituent Assembly. And having decided and determined to establish a democratic independent sovereign State which will guarantee the national unity, safeguard domestic tranquillity, provide the means for common defence, secure the establishment of justice, guarantee the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity and promote economic and social progress and the general welfare. And trusting in God, Master of the Universe, do hereby prepare and resolve this Constitution for the Kingdom of Libya (2).

(1) Federal Regime repealed by Law No. 1 of 1963.
(2) Name of the State amended to read "The Kingdom of Libya" by Law No. 1 of 1963.''''&lt;ref name="libyanconstitutionalunion.net"&gt;http://www.libyanconstitutionalunion.net/constitution%20of%20libya.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Libyan National Assembly prepared and resolved this Constitution in its meeting held in the city of Benghazi on Sunday, 6th Muharram, Hegera 1371 corresponding to 7 October 1951, and delegated its president and the two Vice-Presidents to promulgate it and submit it to His Majesty, the Exalted King, and published in the Official Gazette in Libya.
In pursuance of the Resolution of the National Assembly we have promulgated this Constitution in the city of Benghazi on Sunday, the 6th day of Muharram, Hegera 1371, corresponding to the 7th day of October 1951.

== Strengths and weaknesses ==
The Libyan Constitution contained many elements traditional to the regional, such as proclaiming Islam the religion of the State and setting out in detail the terms on which the hereditary monarchy should govern together with the procedure for succession. In particular, Articles 44 and 45 of the 1951 Constitution specify that Throne of the Kingdom of Libya is transmitted through male preference primogeniture, in line with the Libyan tradition codified by two Royal Orders promulgated on 22nd of Safar 1374 H. and the 25th of Rabi’e el-Thani 1376 H.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, the charter also contain several provisions which entrenched the rights of its citizens to enjoy certain rights common to European and North American nation states, indicating the influence of the key western players in the region. Thus, while stopping short of a secular state (Article 5 proclaims Islam the religion) and while envisioning an inviolable Monarch (Article 59 exempts the King from all responsibility), the 1951 Constitution established a robust democratic apparatus and instituted solid mechanisms for the protection of human rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/06/where-next-libya|title=Where next for Libya?|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Chapter II (Rights of the People) of the Constitution of Libya set out rights such as equality before the law as well as equal civil and political rights, equal opportunities, and an equal responsibility for public duties and obligations, "without distinction of religion, belief, race, language, wealth, kinship or political or social opinions" (Article 11).

Many provisions appear to be in line with modern international standards for the protection of human rights, especially those pertaining to the right to recourse before the courts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, several profiles of the institutional apparatus established by the Constitution of Libya – particularly articles regulating the autonomy of the members of the Parliament in their legislative function (Art. 108), the independence of the judiciary (Art. 142), and procedures for overturning a veto by the King (Art. 136) – present elements of democracy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similarly, the accountability of ministers and public officers is guaranteed by Artt. 90, 114, and 122. Art. 197 enshrines the representative form of the Libyan government and prohibits future amendments that could alter that nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The document sets out a representative parliamentary system based on universal adult suffrage and a Constitutional monarchy in which the King promulgates but cannot veto the Parliament’s acts. Nonetheless, the system of checks and balances among the branches of the Libyan government that the charter enshrines appears to relatively week, especially in light of the limited independence of the judiciary. Moreover, no detailed provision pertaining to democratic elections is available in the document.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Following the coup led by the Libyan army on 1 September 1969 and Idris's subsequent abdication, the Libyan Constitution ceased to have any direct applicability. Several actors, however, have asserted the enduring relevance of the 1951 Constitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113030205/https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2014/04/libya-foreign-minister-interview-return-monarchy.html|title=Libya Foreign Minister calls for return of monarchy|last=Cheaib|first=Ali|date=2014-04-08|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=2017-10-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enduring relevance ==
The document was received as a forward-thinking model of good governance for the region at the time it was released. Significantly, a paper produced in 2012 by Berlin-based independent NGO Democracy Reporting International emphasized that especially the constitutional provisions regarding the protection of human rights, transparency, and safeguards against antidemocratic power accumulations continue to make the charter an attractive document and an important reference point towards a solution to Libya’s political crisis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Growing support on the ground in Libya for the idea that a return to the 1951 Constitution could best serve a transition to a unified and politically stable country was recorded since 2011. Grassroots campaigns promoted by groups devoted to the “Return of the Constitutional Legitimacy” developed in major cities across Libya – from Tripoli, to Zliten, to Benghazi, to Misrata – and gathered significant traction and following on social media.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%83-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-_-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%B3-317037058450330/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%83-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-_-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%B6%D8%B1-605483792899854&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/ZLITENoo/&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar support to the restoration of the Constitution of Libya was voiced by several members of the Libyan committee responsible for drafting a new constitution, the so-called Constitution Drafting Assembly, in 2015 through an online petition. Then-Bayda Mayor Ali Hussain Bubaker wrote a letter to formally endorse the cause as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/605483792899854/photos/a.605722619542638.1073741829.605483792899854/870884159693148/?type=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/ar/north-africa/libya|title=ليبيا - العربية.نت {{!}} الصفحة الرئيسية|website=www.alarabiya.net|language=ar|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2015 Cyrenaican party supporting federalist solutions, the National Federal Bloc, petitioned the Parliament to adopt the Constitution of Libya as a valid and legitimate charter for the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alwasat.ly/ar/news/libya/85676/|title=التكتل الفيدرالي يدعو إلى اعتماد دستور 1951 ويحذر من عدم الاستجابة|last=|first=|date=|work=بوابة الوسط|access-date=2017-10-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing support for the call for the reinstatement of the Constitution of Libya was also recorded by the international press, especially The National Interest in July 2014 and New York Times in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/world/middleeast/a-radical-idea-to-rebuild-a-shattered-libya-restore-the-monarchy.html|title=A Radical Idea to Rebuild a Shattered Libya: Restore the Monarchy|last=Walsh|first=Declan|date=2016-02-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-case-monarchy-libya-10867?page=2|title=The Case for Monarchy in Libya|last=Varga|first=Mark|work=The National Interest|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, British Member of the Parliament Daniel Kawczynski publicly advocated for the return of the Constitution of Libya in response to the increasing support to the cause.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In parallel, the vast majority of the local supportive actors have called for the reinstatement of the Senussi monarchy under the leadership of Mohammed El Hassan El Rida El Senussi as part of the same political project.

When Gaddafi seized power in 1969, Crown Prince Hasan as-Senussi was acting as Regent on behalf of King Idris. He was arrested along with his family and many members of the extended royal household, isolated for years and publicly humiliated by the Gaddafi regime. When, in 1984, he was released from house arrest, he travelled to the UK to seek medical treatment after a stroke had seriously compromised his health. Before dying, in 1992, he designated his second son, Prince Mohammed, as the legitimate heir to the Senussi Crown of Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://24dec1951.com/index.php/libya/the-senussi-family|title=The Senussi Family|last=|first=|date=|website=24dec1951.com|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/med-south/news/heir-to-libyan-throne-under-brussels-spotlight/|title=Heir to Libyan throne under Brussels spotlight|website=EURACTIV.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, in April 2014 leading pan-Arab newspaper Al-Hayat published an interview with Mohamed Abdelaziz, who was then serving as Libya’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, claiming that the reinstatement of the Constitutional Monarchy as regulated by the 1951 Constitution would serve as a “uniting symbol for the nation” as well as “a political umbrella” towards the institution of a regime with a two-council parliament and a technocratic government directed by a prime minister.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== 2017 conference ==
On October 31, 2017, nearly a thousand supporters gathered for the National Conference for the Activation of the Constitution of Independence in [[Gharyan]], one of the largest towns in the Western Mountains.&lt;ref name="libyaherald.com"&gt;https://www.libyaherald.com/2017/11/01/monarchist-conference-in-gharyan-calls-on-prince-mohamed-el-senussi-to-take-up/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7-2005433186410319/&lt;/ref&gt;  Supporters feel the return to the pre-Gaddafi political governance – a time of stability and unity in Libya – will help pull the country out of its enduring crisis.

Prince [[Mohammed El Senussi]], the legitimate heir to the Libyan monarchy, was widely referenced during the event as the would-be leader of the Libyan people if the Constitution of 1951 is restored.&lt;ref name="libyaherald.com"/&gt;  Supporters called for Senussi to “assume all his constitutional powers and resume the constitutional life that the founding fathers created.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://alwasat.ly/ar/news/libya/157629/|title=بالصور: المؤتمر الوطني لتفعيل دستور الاستقلال وعودة الملكية إلى ليبيا يختتم أعماله|last=|first=|date=|work=بوابة الوسط|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was broadcast live on Libyan television, and attendees traveled from many various parts of the region, including Tripoli, [[Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy – Zliten|Zliten]], Benghazi, and Misrata, where grassroots movements advocating for “Return of the Constitutional Legitimacy” have gained momentum.

Ashraf Baoudoura, who coordinated the event, said similar conferences will be held in Beida, Jaghbub and Tobruk.&lt;ref name="libyaherald.com"/&gt;

{{for|a person convicted of a felony crime|Convicted felon}}
{{hatnote|See also [[Conviction]].}}

A '''convict''' is "a person found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of a [[crime]] and [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]d by a [[court]]" or "a person serving a sentence in [[prison]]".&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, p. 311 (2d Coll. Ed. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Convicts are often also known as "[[prisoner]]s" or "inmates" or by the [[slang]] term "con",&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, p. 292 (2d Coll. Ed. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; while a common label for former convicts, especially those recently released from prison, is "'''ex-con'''" ("'''ex-convict'''"). Persons convicted and sentenced to [[Community sentence|non-custodial sentence]]s tend not to be described as "convicts".

The legal{{cn|date=December 2014}} label of "ex-convict" usually has lifelong implications, such as [[social stigma]] and/or reduced opportunities for employment. The [[Government of Australia|federal government of Australia]], for instance, will not, in general, employ an ex-convict, while some [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments may limit the time for or before which a former convict may be employed.{{cn|date=December 2014}}

==Historical usage==
[[File:Convicts at Botany Bay.jpg|thumb|Convicts at [[Botany Bay]], [[New South Wales]], 1789]]
[[File:Prisoners and gendarms on the road to Siberia (Geoffroy, 1845).JPG|thumb|Convicts and guards on the road to [[Siberia]], 1845]]
The particular use of the term "convict" in the English-speaking world was to describe the huge numbers of criminals, both male and female, who clogged British [[gaol]]s in the 18th and early 19th century.  Their crimes would today be regarded as petty misdemeanours (stealing small items or food), or are no longer in the criminal code ([[Debtors' prison|such as being in unresolved debt]]).  Most of the punishments at this time were severe, with the death penalty (hanging) applied for fairly minor crimes.  However, this ultimate sentence was often commuted to a lesser one, commonly for transportation (for 7 or 14 years, or for life) to the colonies.  Thus, in the British context, the term "convict" has come to refer in particular to those criminals transported overseas.

Initially many British convicts were sent to the American colonies, such as the [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], and the [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]], as cheap labour. The transportation of convicts from the United Kingdom began around 1615 and became increasingly common in the following years.  Initially most people were transported to North America or the West Indies, but from 1718 onwards transportation was entirely to North America.  The arrangements ceased when the [[American Revolutionary War]] meant it was no longer possible for the United Kingdom to send convicts to what had become the United States.

The British Government then looked to the newly discovered east coast of Australia to use as a penal colony. Convicts were transported to [[Australia]] in 1787, arriving in Botany Bay, then Sydney Cove, in January 1788. From the very start of European settlement convicts were used as indentured labourers in five out of the six colonies. Many were used on public works, but a significant number were "assigned" to private individuals as domestic servants, rural workers, etc. Transportation was progressively abolished from 1853, eventually ceasing altogether in 1868.

In Australia, convicts have come to be key figures of cultural [[mythology]] and [[historiography]]. Many became prominent businesspeople and respected citizens, and some prominent families in present-day Australian society can trace their origins to convict ancestors who rose above their humble origins.  However, during the transportation era and for many years after, previous convicts and their descendants tended to hide their former criminal background, sometimes resulting in distorted or completely missing family history.  Extensive and comprehensive records kept on every individual are now able to fill in the gaps; and, in fact, many family historians can find out more about their convict ancestors than they can about those who arrived in Australia as free settlers.

British convicts were also sent to [[Canada]], [[West Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Emma |last=Christopher |title=A Merciless Place. The Lost Story of Britain's Convict Disaster in Africa |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-969593-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]]. [[France]] also sent convicts to [[New Caledonia]] and to [[Devil's Island]] in [[French Guiana]].

The '''copyright law of Chile''' is governed by Law No. 17,336, on Intellectual Property of October 2 of 1970 and subsequent amendments.  It was implemented in the Decree No. 1122 of the [[Ministry of Education of Chile]] on May 17 of 1971.

This law aims to protect the economic and [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] of Chilean authors and foreigners residing in [[Chile]], granted by the mere fact of creating works that are literary, artistic and scientific.

It states that foreign authors who aren't [[Domicile (law)|domiciled]] in the country enjoy the protection that is recognized by the international conventions that Chile has signed and ratified.

== History ==
The [[Constitution of Chile]] of 1833 stipulated in Article 152 that "Every author or inventor shall have exclusive ownership of his discovery or production .." resulting in the act Literary and Artistic Property of July 24 of 1834 being passed.

It was replaced by Decree Law No. 345, Intellectual Property, of May 5 of 1925.

In turn, the 1950 Act 9.549 extended the copyright duration after the death of the author to fifty years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}&lt;!-- this is at odds with the Duration section which says it was extended to 50 pma in 1992 --&gt;

In 1970, Chile signed and ratified the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] which states, among other principles, that the protection of the works should not be conditional upon compliance with any [[copyright formalities|formality requirements]].

Before it was due to issue a new law compatible with the international treaty, the Chilean government enacted Law No. 17,336, on Intellectual Property of October 2 of 1970 which, repealed the previous legislation on the subject.

== Types of works ==
Although the law provides a list of protected works, it is not exhaustive.

* Books, pamphlets, articles and writings.
* Conferences, speeches, lectures, reports, reviews, etc., both written or recorded versions
* Dramatic, dramatic-musical and theater in general, pantomimes and choreographic
* Music
* Adaptations of literary or original works, his librettos and screenplays, radio or television productions of literary works
* Newspapers and magazines
* Photographs, engravings and lithographs
* Films
* Projects, sketches and architectural models
* Audio-visual materials relating to any science
* Paintings, drawings, illustrations, etc.
* Sculptures and works of figurative art
* Scenographic sketches and scenes
* Adaptations, translations and other transformations, when authorized by the original author of the work if it is not in the public domain
* Video and slide shows
* Software

== Types of rights ==
The types of rights under Chilean law is divided in two:
* [[Moral rights (copyright law)|Moral rights]] consists in the recognition of authorship of the work, being able to oppose any changes, keep the work unpublished, and so on. These rights are inalienable and not transferable, but can be transmitted to the surviving spouse and heirs.
* [[Property rights]] consist of the use of the work, whether its publication, reproduction, adaptation, translation or processing performance.  These rights can be transferred to third parties after permission of the author or rights holder.

== Duration of protection ==
The protection of copyright in Chile is for the life of the author and 70 years after his death.

Originally, the Law No. 17,336 established an extension of 30 years, which was amended in 1992, increasing that period to 50 years after the death of the author.  In turn, this duration was increased again in 2003 by Law No. 19,914, to 70 years.

Article 10 of Law 17,336 provides that if there is a spouse or unmarried daughters or widows whose spouse or affected by an inability to perform any kind of work, this period will extend until the date of death last of the survivors.

== Public domain ==
Law No. 17,336, recognizes the existence of [[public domain]].

Included in this type of work common cultural heritage of the following:
* Works whose term of protection has been extinguished
* Works of unknown authorship, including the songs, legends, dances and expressions of folklore
* Works whose holders waived the protection afforded by this law
* Works of foreign authors, residing abroad, who are not protected by copyright laws abroad or in Chile.
* Works expropriated by the state, unless a beneficiary is specified by law.

== Exceptions to copyright ==
There are exceptions where the law authorised certain uses of works protected by intellectual property law, without going through the permission of the copyright owner, thereby balancing between protecting the interests of authors and the public interest.

Among the exceptions that the Chilean law are:

; Quotations

== 2010 law ==
In May 2007, President [[Michelle Bachelet]] sent Congress a proposed amendment to this law, pretending to make procedures more effective prosecution of crimes, increase penalties for violations of fronts to establish a system of limiting liability for [[Internet service providers]], incorporate exceptions and limitations that are favorable to libraries, educational establishments and the general public, and regulate the establishment of tariffs by the collecting societies.

The project was very controversial due to the opposition of interests, including the Sociedad Chilena del Derecho de Autor (SCD), the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]], the Chilean Book Chamber&lt;ref&gt;Chilean Association of Publishers, Distributors and Booksellers {{Cite web|title=Quiénes somos |publisher=La Cámara Chilena del Libro (Chilean Book Chamber) |url=http://camaradellibro.cl/quienes-somos/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RhSsKHMh?url=http://camaradellibro.cl/quienes-somos/ |archivedate=9 August 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand, and on the other hand are the academic institutions, [[College of Librarians of Chile]], [[Library Council of Rectors of Universities]], [[NGO Digital Rights]], among many others.

The Ministry of Culture, in turn, led the process in Congress, in which signed a controversial confidentiality agreement with the collecting society who agreed to accept a series of demands of copyright holders including the elimination of a number of exceptions for educational use, libraries and primarily uses the exception of the proposal fair. One of the most controversial provisions has been the establishment of an exemption permitting certain uses of protected works without permission, equivalent to the American [[fair use]].

After all the discussion, on 13 January 2010, this flagship project of the administration of [[Paulina Urrutia]] was approved unanimously by the National Congress of Chile, entered into force on 4 May 2010, as No. 20.435.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Campbell, Dennis|year=2010|title=Internet: Laws and Regulatory Regimes|edition=second|publisher=Juris Publishing|location=Huntington, New York|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=R3TlAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR231 231]|isbn=978-1-57823-291-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Espinoza, Helder Binimelis|year=2013|chapter=La experiencia personal y el diálogo teórico como insumos para el desarrollo de un problema deinvestigación social|editor1=Julio Aibar, Julio |editor2=Cortés, Fernando |editor3=Martínez, Liliana |editor4=Zaremberg, Gisela |title=El helicoide de la investigación: metodología en tesis de ciencias sociales|language=Spanish|publisher=Flacso México|location=Mexico, DF|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eRL8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT65 65]|isbn=978-607-9275-21-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criminal anarchy in the United States''' is the doctrine that organized government should be overthrown by force or violence, or by assassination of the executive head or of any of the executive officials of government, or by any unlawful means. The advocacy of such doctrine either by word of mouth or writing is a felony in many U.S. states. Circa 1955, the [[United States Solicitor General]] said that forty-two States plus Alaska and Hawaii had statutes which in some form prohibited advocacy of the violent overthrow of established government.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|350|497|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==

===Federal===
At the federal level, criminal anarchy is criminalized by {{usc|18|2385}}, which makes it an offense punishable by 20 years' imprisonment to advocate the overthrow of the U.S. government. Violation of this statute can also result in losing one's [[U.S. citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|8|1481|a|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Constitution|Constitutionality]] of these statutes at the present time is highly questionable. In 1925, criminal anarchy statutes were ruled constitutional in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'', {{ussc|268|652|1925}}. However, in 1969, the subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decision of ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|395|444|1969}} overturned nearly all criminalization of political speech, including advocacy of the violent overthrow of the government, unless such speech "is directed to inciting or producing [[imminent lawless action]] and is likely to incite or produce such action."&lt;ref&gt;[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]], pg. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

===State===
At the state level, the remaining criminal anarchy statutes (in 2013) are:

'''Cujas Library''' ({{lang-fr|Bibliothèque Cujas}}), named after the French jurist and scholar [[Jacques Cujas]] (1520&amp;ndash;1590), is an academic research library, and the largest law library in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, Godfrey (2008). ''[[Library world records]]'' (2nd ed.) McFarland &amp; Company, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the [[Latin Quarter]], next to the [[Panthéon]] and [[Sainte-Geneviève Library]], in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris]].

== History ==

Cujas Library was originally the library of the Law School of the University of Paris (which dates back to 1215).&lt;br /&gt;
The collections of the library were dispersed during the [[French Revolution]] . Consequently the current collections have been built since 1829 only.&lt;br /&gt;
From 1876 to 1914, Paul Viollet, head librarian, dedicated much effort to developing the library’s collections. At that time, the library was located in the main building of the Law School of Paris, on the [[Place du Panthéon]]. In 1958, a new building was opened to house the Library.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1970, the University of Paris was split into several universities. The former Law School library became an inter-university library. In 1978, the library took the name of Cujas Library.&lt;br /&gt;
Since 1979, Cujas Library has been operating under the supervision of [[Panthéon-Assas University]] and [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]].

== Privileges ==

Access to the library is mainly for scholars, [[Panthéon-Assas University]] and [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University|Panthéon-Sorbonne University]] 3rd-year undergraduates and postgraduates, and other universities' students (LLM and PhD students), and people with special interests in law, economics, and political sciences.

== Collections ==

The library is specialized in Law, since it has been and still is a major reference and research library in legal studies. But Economics and Political Sciences are also targeted for acquisitions.&lt;br /&gt;
The library holds 750,000 items, including all [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University|Panthéon-Sorbonne University]] and [[Panthéon-Assas University]] legal dissertations and some doctoral dissertations from other universities. It is also a European Documentation Centre and has official documents by the United Nations and its committees from 1948 to 2010. Documents from the League of Nations, from the International Labour Organization and from the International Labour Office (journals) are also present.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a significant rare book collection and reading room ({{lang-fr|salle du patrimoine}}) whose items have been acquired over the years.&lt;br /&gt;
Cujas Library has a partnership with the French National Library ({{lang-fr|[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]}}), as far as projects in the field of Law are concerned, especially in preservation and digitization.

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}'''South African customary law''' refers to a usually [[codification (law)|uncodified]] [[legal system]] developed and practised by the indigenous communities of [[South Africa]]. [[custom (law)|Customary law]] has been defined as

&lt;blockquote&gt;an established system of immemorial rules [...] evolved from the way of life and natural wants of the people, the general context of which was a matter of common knowledge, coupled with precedents applying to special cases, which were retained in the memories of the chief and his councilors, their sons and their sons' sons until forgotten, or until they became part of the immemorial rules.{{Sfn|Bekker|1989|p=11}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Most African states follow a pluralistic form of law that includes customary law, [[religious law]]s, received law (such as [[common law]] or [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]) and state legislation.{{Sfn|Ndulo|2011|p=87-88}} The [[Constitution of South Africa|South African Constitution]] recognizes traditional authority and customary law under Section 211.{{Sfn|Ndulo|2011|p=98}} A ruling under ''[[Bhe v Magistrate, Khayelitsha|Bhe v. Magistrate, Khayelitsha]]'' specified that customary law was "protected by and subject to the Constitution in its own right."{{Sfn|Ndulo|2011|p=98}} Customary law, prior to [[colonialism]], had its "sources in the practices, traditions and customs of the people."{{Sfn|Ndolu|2011|p=88}} Customary law is fluid, and changes over time and among different groups of people.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/customary-law-south-africa-historical-development-legal-system-and-its-relation-women%E2%80%99s-righ|title=Customary Law in South Africa: Historical Development as a Legal System and its Relation to Women’s Rights|last=Wall|first=Devon|date=15 June 2015|website=South African History Online|publisher=|access-date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] is often tied into customary law.{{Sfn|Nwauche|2015|p=570}} [[Sally Falk Moore]] suggests that to have a more realistic idea of the manner in which people live according to 'the law' and 'social mores' it is necessary to study the law in the context of society, rather than attempting to separate the 'law' from 'society'.{{Sfn|Griffiths|2006|p=298}}

== Constitutional recognition of customary law ==
{{see also|Law of South Africa}}Recognition of customary law comes through the [[Constitution of South Africa|South African Constitution]] under section 211,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/chp12.html|title=Chapter 12, Section 211-212|last=|first=|date=|website=The South African Constitution|publisher=The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|access-date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is not a "textual connection in the definition of customary law to the communities recognised in section 31(1)."{{Sfn|Nwauche|2015|p=575}} The application of African Customary Law (ACL) is subject to the Constitution as well as to any legislation that specifically deals with it.

African Customary Law (ACL) is further protected within the Bill of Rights, most notably under the right to freedom, belief and opinion (s 15), the individual right to language and culture (s 30) as well as the collective right pertaining to cultural, religious and linguistic communities (s 31). The protection of ACL within the Bill of Rights is not subject to the same conditions as in s 211(3), namely that it must be used where applicable and subject to the relevant legislation. Accordingly, the rights in the Bill of Rights protecting ACL are subject only to the Constitution (and specifically, other rights in the Bill of Rights), and can only be limited in terms of s 36, being the general limitations clause.{{Sfn|Lehnert|2005|p=245}}

Pursuant to the Constitutional Principles, the Constitution protects and recognises ACL in various ways. Chapter 12 (ss 211 and 212) affords official recognition to ACL as well as to the institution, status and role of traditional leadership. Specifically, s 211(3) mandates the application of ACL by the courts, where applicable.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The applicability of customary law rules is governed by the common law choice of law rules.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Colonial rule ===
Developments in customary law took place primarily after 1652, when [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial settlers]] arrived in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It didn't take long for the coloniser to realise that colonial law was not always appropriate or convenient for the colonised in dealing with instances of everyday life (such as family law).{{Sfn|Griffiths|2006|p=291}} Accordingly, the colonial state began to define the parameters that marked the jurisdictions of legal systems within its control and, in so doing, divided colonial and customary law into "separate and [allegedly] autonomous spheres."{{Sfn|Griffiths|2006|p=291}} In addition, there were many different types of customary law, each based on the indigenous group practicing the law.{{Sfn|Mamdani|1996|p=110}}

[[Mahmood Mamdani]] has emphasized the importance of [[Theophilus Shepstone]]'s role in creating the system known today as [[indirect rule]] and, with it, official customary law.&lt;ref&gt;Mamdani, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Shepstone, as the highest colonial official in [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]], was responsible for all native affairs from the creation of the colony until his transfer to the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] in 1877. He combined both "indigenous customs and British legal procedures" into what was called "native customary law."{{Sfn|Carton|2000|p=25}} Combining these two types of law into one allowed the colonizers to "use" traditional leaders and traditional ceremonies to support their own legal legitimacy in South Africa.{{Sfn|Ranger|1994|p=15-16}} The "Shepstone system" enforced a "[[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] arrangement" of hierarchy and became the foundation of policy for dealing with indigenous peoples in South Africa for many decades afterwards.{{Sfn|Carton|2000|p=25}}

In 1847, the Natal Commission found that any "African law which was not incompatible with [[Roman-Dutch law]] would have to be used for the time being."{{Sfn|Chanock|2001|p=245-246}} In Natal, customary law was further recognized through the Natal Code of 1878.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The code defined "native law" and "included the subjugation of women to men, the subjugation of children their father or to the head of the family, and the rule of [[primogeniture]]."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Northern Republics of South Africa (Transvaal and the [[Free State (province)|Free State]]) were less inclined to allow or accommodate a system of African customary law that was separate to the Republican law.{{Sfn|Chanock|2001|p=270}}

The British defeat by the Zulu in 1879 and the [[Bambatha Rebellion|Zulu rebellion of 1906]] had profound effects on South African law and customary law in Natal.{{Sfn|Chanock|2001|p=245}} Likewise, the [[Cape Colony]] met customary law with a policy of assimilation. The assimilation was started by the abolition of slavery and lip service was given to the notion of 'rights to all', regardless of race.{{Sfn|Chanock|2001|p=250}} In 1880, the government looked into native laws and customs in order to codify criminal and civil law.{{Sfn|Chanock|2001|p=252}} Natives were never used as a source of information for their own culture.{{Sfn|Chanock|2001|p=252}} However, many objections stifled assimilation, including the colonial objection to customary practices pertaining to inheritance and marriage, especially in regard to [[polygamy]] and [[bride price]]s.{{Sfn|Chanock|2001|p=253}}

After the Union of South Africa was created in 1910, customary law was handled by each separate territory as needed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because of the confusion created by this system, the government created the [[Native Administration Act, 1927|Native Administration Act of 1927]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This law, in Section 11, recognized customary law, so that it would be "granted full recognition in both chiefly and Commissioner courts," with the commissioner deciding where and when customary law may be applied.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Apartheid era ===
After the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] gained power, they introduced [[apartheid]] in 1948 and used the [[Bantu Authorities Act, 1951|Bantu Authorities Act of 1951]] to create "an administrative hierarchy of tribal, regional, and territorial authorities in traditional communities."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== South African Constitution ===
{{See also|Constitution of South Africa}}

South Africa's transition to a constitutional democracy came about through an intricate negotiation process between the various political parties. In essence, it was a two-step process. It involved, in the first instance, the drafting of an Interim Constitution in 1993 and its subsequent approval by the parties in the Multi-Party Negotiating Process (MPNP). Constituencies of traditional leaders were represented at the MPNP.{{Sfn|Bennet|2004|p=77}} The issues that concerned these leaders, mainly relating to the status of African Customary Law (ACL) and the recognition of a right to culture in the Constitution, became some of the most hotly contested issues during the negotiations.{{Sfn|Kaganas and Murray|1994|p=409}}

The effect of a supreme constitution would allow for judicial review of the actions of traditional leaders as well as scrutiny and amendment of ACL more generally. The debate centred on the issue of [[gender equality]] because some of the tenets of ACL accord more rights and authority to men than they do women.{{Sfn|Kaganas and Murray|1994|p=410}} At times, the bargaining process was used as a means to secure the role of the traditional leaders in the new constitutional era.{{Sfn|Kaganas and Murray|1994|p=410}} One difficulty is that ACL was subverted by colonialism and apartheid rule.{{Sfn|Kaganas and Murray|1994|p=411}}

Initially, the traditional leaders tried to get an exemption for ACL from the application of the Bill of Rights.{{Sfn|Bennet|2004|p=77}} They based their arguments on the Zimbabwean Constitution.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The Zimbabwean constitution shields customary law from the provision forbidding discrimination at s 23(1) and (3)(b)&lt;/ref&gt; The interim Constitution came into effect on 27 April 1994, coinciding with South Africa's first democratic elections. After an intensive Constitutional Assembly negotiation process, and a process of its certification by the Constitutional Court against the Constitutional Principles in the Interim Constitution, the final Constitution was passed in 1996 and came into force in early 1997.

== Constitutional Court case law ==
There have been a number of cases that have come before the Constitutional Court requiring it to interpret and apply the rights and principles in the Constitution pertaining to ACL. In doing so, the CC has not only been faced with the challenge of elucidating the extent to which ACL is now recognised, but it has also had to address the issue of how to go about ascertaining what that law in fact is. The first such substantive case is ''[[Alexkor v Richtersveld Community|Alexkor Ltd and Another v the Richtersveld Community and Others]]'', which involved the appeal of a claim for restitution of land by the [[Richtersveld]] Community ('the Community'), an indigenous South African community, in terms of the [[Restitution of Land Rights Act]]. The Constitutional Court therefore had to examine whether or not the Community had rights in land in 1913 and, if so, whether or not it was subsequently dispossessed 'as a result of past racially discriminatory laws or practices.' It was in answering the first of these questions that the Court made various authoritative comments regarding the extent to which ACL is now recognised.

The Court essentially stated two broad principles. Firstly, ACL is an independent source of law, not to be interpreted 'through the common-law lens.'&lt;ref&gt;''Alexkor'', para 51&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is to be seen as parallel to the common law. Secondly, the recognition of ACL is circumscribed by its consistency with the Constitution and any legislation concerning ACL. The CC drew specifically on s 211(3) of the Constitution. Applying these principles, the Court found that the Community did indeed have (indigenous) rights in land in 1913, which were left unaltered by British annexation. It then added an important third principle – that customary law in the Constitution really referred to the living form of that law:

:…It is important to note that indigenous law is not a fixed body of formally classified and easily ascertainable rules. By its very nature it evolves as the people who live by its norms change their patterns of life…In applying indigenous law, it is important to bear in mind that, unlike common law, indigenous law is not written. It is a system of law that was known to the community, practised and passed on from generation to generation. It is a system of law that has its own values and norms. Throughout its history it has evolved and developed to meet the changing needs of the community. And it will continue to evolve within the context of its values and norms consistently with the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Alexkor'', 52–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The court specifically acknowledged the difficulty of establishing customary law, given the relative unreliability of written sources on customary law, and the fact that there may be competing versions of customary law presented in evidence, when such is appealed to.

In a subsequent case of ''Shilubana and Others v Nwamitwa'', the Constitutional Court spelled out the principles that should govern how living customary law rules are identified by courts and when courts should develop the customary law. Ms Shilubana, of the Valoyi traditional community, which is located in the [[Limpopo|Limpopo Province]] of South Africa, was appointed as hosi (chief) of her people contrary to the past practice of the eldest son of the previous hosi succeeding his father as the new hosi. The resolution adopted in appointing her specifically referred to the constitutional provision for gender equality as part of the community's motivation in adapting its rules. Mr Nwamitwa sought to dispute Ms Shilubana's appointment based on his purported right as the eldest son of the previous hosi. The matter was decided in favour of Mr Nwamitwa in both the High Court and the SCA, and the case was eventually taken on appeal to the Constitutional Court. In a unanimous judgment, the Court decided that Ms Shilubana was legitimately appointed as hosi of the Valoyi people. The Court emphasised the fact that ACL is a living system of law not bound by historical precedent.&lt;ref name=shilubana44&gt;''Shilubana'', 44&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, it set aside a series of prior decisions that had set a test for determining the content of customary law by referencing long-standing and historical practices. The Court found that ACL is meant to reflect the current practices of a particular community and hence is developed with reference to the constantly evolving practices that indicate the current system of norms by which that community has chosen to live.&lt;ref&gt;''Shilubana'', 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; The Court therefore held that the ACL regarding the hosi had legitimately developed to allow for a woman to be appointed and that this development was consistent with the Constitution.&lt;ref name=shilubana44/&gt; Therefore, the appeal was upheld, the Court finding that Ms Shilubana had been validly appointed.

The precedent of ''Shilubana'' stopped courts from avoiding the difficulties by devising a test that finally forced them to confront these challenges directly.Woodman refers to the second option as "selective legal pluralism" and affords the state with the opportunity to consider the needs of justice in each case involving customary law. Consequently, Woodman argues that to achieve justice, elements of state law pluralism should coincide with deep legal pluralism with the operation of is doctrine of selective legal pluralism. It would seem that, in this decision, the Constitutional Court espoused Woodman's theory of "selective legal pluralism". Woodman refers to two options available at this point; either an unqualified tolerance can be afforded to customary law, or allowance can be made for the purposeful and principled intrusion by the state into the field of customary law.{{Sfn|Woodman|1996|p=166}}

== Rights, women and culture ==
Customary law in South Africa is tied to ethnicity, so that "a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] who desires expressly or by implication to be bound by [[Sotho people|Sotho]] customary law could be faced with considerable difficulties despite the promise of section 30 of the Constitution."{{Sfn|Nwauche|2015|p=570}} Customary law and ethnicity has roots in the idea of [[kinship]], which colonizers used to enforce morality within tribes and between tribes.{{Sfn|Ranger|1994|p=14}}

The recognition of ACL has tended to be seen as a danger to women's rights and interests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The system of customary law, running parallel to state legislation "create a stumbling block for advancing gender equality and women's rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/gender-inequality-95-billion-issue-sub-saharan-africa/|title=Gender inequality is a $95 billion issue in sub-Saharan Africa|last=Moritz-Rabson|first=Daniel|date=28 August 2016|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=20 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have been denied many rights under customary law and were even seen as legal minors, regardless of their age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlce.co.za/index.php/2013-04-30-11-53-09/2013-05-08-11-48-14/land-housing/209-women-s-property-rights-under-customary-law|title=Women's Property Rights Under Customary Law|last=|first=|date=|website=Women's Legal Centre|publisher=|access-date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women seeking redress in a traditional court may, according to customary law, be unable to represent herself.{{Sfn|Nhlapo|2014|p=30-31}} As a result, most strategies to secure women's rights (in land) in rural South Africa have tended to avoid the customary law arena and instead favoured formal legal initiatives.{{Sfn|Claassens and Mnisi|2009|p=493}}

Aninka Claassens and Sindiso Mnisi advocate that legal strategies to support women's rights cannot avoid the customary law arena and should, in fact, engage with it fully.{{Sfn|Claassens and Mnisi|2009|p=493}} This is because of the impact of ACL on power relations, which means that rural women have no option but to grapple with issues of rights and custom at the local level.{{Sfn|Claassens and Mnisi|2009|p=493}} Legal strategies therefore need to pay attention to the legal changes taking place outside the statutory law arena, where women are playing a key role in negotiating the content of rights under custom, and appealing to both the discourses of rights and custom as they do so.{{Sfn|Claassens and Mnisi|2009|p=500}} The [[National Movement of Rural Women]] (NMRW) was created to help rural women keep control of their land and to give them a greater voice in government.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Bachram|first=Heidi|date=2007|title=Power Surge|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=26753812&amp;site=ehost-live|magazine=New Internationalist|volume=|issue=400|page=9|doi=|pmid=|access-date=17 September 2016|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The customary laws of marriage and succession are the main areas where the South African legislature and courts have attempted to advance women's rights. With regard to marriage, in 1998, Parliament passed the [[Recognition of Customary Marriages Act, 1998|Recognition of Customary Marriages Act]] with the intention of ridding the customary law of marriage of elements that discriminated against women. The Act makes provision for customary marriages in two ways: firstly, all marriages prior to the Act that were valid in terms of ACL are valid for all legal purposes (this did away with the ambivalence in South African history toward the legitimacy of African marriages); and secondly, all marriages conducted in terms of ACL after the Act came into force are valid if they fulfil the Act's requirements. Both customary marriages and civil marriages could be registered at [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Home Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201603011722.html|title=South Africa: Customary Marriage - Is the Law Working?|last=Moore|first=Elena|date=1 March 2016|work=All Africa|last2=Himonga|first2=Chuma|access-date=19 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act accommodates what might be called common law provisions in areas of minors' marriages, the status of spouses, as well as the proprietary consequences of marriage and divorce.

Officially, in terms of the [[Recognition of Customary Marriages Act]], "'customary law' means the customs and usages traditionally observed among the indigenous African peoples of South Africa and form part of the culture of those peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite act|title=Recognition of Customary Marriages Act|number=120|date=1998|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1998-120.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no clear distinction, then, between the religion, the culture and the law of such peoples.{{Sfn|Nwauche|2015|p=576}} In terms of the eventually rejected&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.womeninandbeyond.org/?p=9171|title=The Traditional Courts Bill is dead.

A '''droit''' ([[French language|French]] for ''[[right]]'' or ''[[Law]]'') is a legal title, claim or due.

==Droits of admiralty (English law)==
{{Update-EB|section=yes|date=March 2016}}
The term is used in [[English law]] in the phrase "[[droits of admiralty]]".  This refers to certain customary rights or perquisites, formerly belonging to the [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]], but now to the crown, for public purposes and paid into the [[Exchequer]]. These ''droits'' (see also [[Shipwreck|wreck]]) consisted of [[flotsam]], [[jetsam]], ligan -  (goods or wreckage on the sea bed that is attached to a buoy so that it can be recovered), [[treasure]], [[deodand]], [[derelict (maritime)]], within the admiral's jurisdiction; all [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[Forfeiture (law)|forfeitures]], [[ransom]]s, [[recognizance]]s and pecuniary punishments; all [[sturgeon]]s, [[whale]]s, [[porpoise]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[orca|grampuses]] and such large fishes; all ships and goods of the enemy coming into any creek, road or port, by durance or mistake; all ships seized at sea, salvage, etc., with the share of prizes such shares being afterwards called "tenths", in imitation of the French, who gave their admiral a ''droit de dixième''. The droits of admiralty were definitely surrendered for the benefit of the public by Prince [[George of Denmark]], when Lord High Admiral of England in 1702. [[American law]] does not recognize any such droits, and the disposition of captured property is regulated by various acts of [[United States Congress|Congress]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=588}}

==Other legal connexions (French law, etc.)==
The term ''droit'' is also used in various legal connexions (i.e., [[French law]]), such as the ''droit'' of [[angary]], the ''droit d'achat'' ([[right of pre-emption]]) in the case of [[contraband]], the [[feudal]] ''droit de bris'' (see wreck), the ''[[droit de regale]]'' or ancient royal privilege of claiming the revenues and patronage of a vacant [[Diocese|bishopric]], and the feudal droites of [[seignory]] generally.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=588}}

In French, ''droit'' can mean ''the whole body of the [[Law]]'', as in the motto "[[dieu et mon droit]]," which is to say "God and my whole body of Law."  ''Droit d'auteur'' is a term for [[French copyright law]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

'''Echelon''' is a [[warez]] group which specializes in the illegal release and distribution of copyrighted console games, such as [[Dreamcast]] and [[PlayStation 2]] [[ISO image]]s. They also created [[Demo (computer programming)|demos]] on both platforms.

Between September 4, 2000 to April 30, 2002, Echelon's Dreamcast division released 188 game titles and 34 other various fixes, tutorials, [[trainer (games)|trainers]], and loaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theisonews.com/release.php?releaseid=48757 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070927121255/http://www.theisonews.com/release.php?releaseid=48757 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |title=Evil_Twin_Cypriens_Chronicles_DC-ECHELON |accessdate=2009-09-17 |date=2002-04-30 |publisher=[[The iSONEWS]] }} See also [http://ludibria.com/nfo.php?sys=sdc&amp;sysid=300].&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, 2001, Echelon released [[Final Fantasy X]] as their first of several hundred PlayStation 2 titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orlydb.com/6?q=PS2+ECHELON |title=Echelon pre database search query |accessdate=2010-02-02 |publisher=OrlyDB}} Site name is based on the [[O RLY?]] Internet phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, Echelon continues to release games for the PS2 platform.

In 2004, Echelon was named as one of six groups targeted as part of [[Operation Fastlink]] by the [[United States Department of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/fastlink.htm| title= Justice Department Announces International Internet Piracy Sweep| accessdate= 2009-09-17| authorlink= Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section| date= 2004-04-22| publisher= [[United States Department of Justice]]| location= [[Washington, D.C.]]| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090531150417/http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/fastlink.htm| archivedate= 2009-05-31| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2005, Echelon's [[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King|Dragon Quest VIII]] USA PS2 [[.nfo|nfo file]] stated that Echelon was indeed [[Kalisto (warez group)|Kalisto]]: ''We errr Kalisto released it on November 2nd 2001 as Dragon_Warrior_VII_USA_PS1-KALISTO'', referring to the previous game in the series and the nfo ended with ''-- the dragon warrior of KALiSTO''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ludibria.com/nfo.php?sys=ps2&amp;sysid=932 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714002327/http://www.ludibria.com/nfo.php?sys=ps2&amp;sysid=932 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-14 |title=Dragon_Quest_VIII_USA_PS2-ECHELON |date=2005-11-16 |publisher=LUDiBRiA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sega Smash Pack ROM Loader==
The '''Sega Smash Pack ROM Loader''' is a front-end loader program released by the [[warez]] group Echelon, allowing a user to load their own [[ROM image|ROMs]] into the [[Sega Genesis]] [[emulator]] built into [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Smash Pack]] Volume 1 game for the [[Dreamcast]].  Provided in the release are the emulation software, tools, and instructions on burning a CD with custom ROMs.

The legality of such a loader is dubious, even if one owns the original title.  As it runs in full speed with very few issues (the most prominent being its poor sound), the emulator, being dubbed "Segagen" to avoid legal issues, was originally embraced in the Dreamcast [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] community.  However, after much controversy, most Dreamcast web sites soon stopped hosting the ROM loader.

Due to the loader's small text and poor controls, [[Obsidian (software developer)|Obsidian]] later released their own version of the Sega Smash Pack ROM Loader, called "Lemec."  It featured larger, easier-to-read text, quick scrolling through files, additional [[VMU]] functionality, and added stability.  Obsidian's release did not include the Smash Pack emulator software for legal reasons.  As such, the user requires the original Echelon release in order to build a disk using the Lemec loader.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14007">'''Exceptional circumstances''' are the conditions required to grant additional powers to a government agency or government leader so as to alleviate, or mitigate, unforeseen or unconventional hardship. The term is commonly used in [[Australia]], where it has been applied in various contexts, most recognizably in relation to special consideration policies for students and [[drought relief]] payments for farmers known as ''Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payments'' or ECRP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daff.gov.au/agriculture-food/drought/ec DAFF Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payments]&lt;/ref&gt; It is similarly used in the [[law of the United States]], particularly in the [[Immigration and Nationality Act]] (INA).&lt;ref name="INA"/&gt;

==Australia==

===Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payments===

The Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payments or ECRP program was established in 1992 and has continued in various forms since. It provides financial assistance to farmers considered to be experiencing exceptional circumstances. Eligibility is generally determined by geographic location; specific areas are considered to be experiencing worse-than-normal drought conditions and, as such, farmers in those areas qualify for assistance. Farm-dependent [[small business]]es may also be eligible for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/agriculture-food/drought/assistance/small_businesses |title=Small Businesses |accessdate=2009-11-12 |work=Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Australia) |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the [[Australian Government]] [[Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Australia)|Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry]] announced that the payments would continue for an additional 12 months in 52 areas throughout Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rural/news/content/200902/s2490440.htm ABC Rural News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptional Circumstances Interest Subsidy===
The Australian Government has also established a program to provide low-interest [[loan]]s via private financial institutions which receive a subsidy from the Government. The program is known as the Exceptional Circumstances Interest Subsidy support scheme.

Qualification is based on terms (geographical location) set by the Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payments program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raa.nsw.gov.au/assistance/ec/primary-producers NSW Rural Assistance Authority - EC Interest Support]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Australian Government Departments===
The term has been used in a range of other governmental contexts in Australia including, but not limited to:

*The [[Department of Health and Ageing]] accreditation of [[aged care]] facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/Publishing.nsf/Content/ageing-rescare-excpcirc.htm Health.gov.au Aged Care Exceptional Circumstances]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Department of Immigration and Citizenship]] - [[visa (document)|visa]]s, [[immigration]] and [[refugee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immi.gov.au/refugee/circumstances.htm Immigration - Exceptional Circumstances]&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States==
In the [[Immigration and Nationality Act]] (INA) of the [[United States]], "[t]he term 'exceptional circumstances' refers to exceptional circumstances (such as [[Battery (crime)|battery]] or extreme [[cruelty]] to the [[alien (law)#United States|alien]] or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the [[spouse]], child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien."&lt;ref name="INA"&gt;{{uscsub|8|1229a|e|1}}; see also ''Matter of Jean'', [https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/07/25/3472.pdf 23 I&amp;N Dec. 373] ([[United States Attorney General|A.G.]] 2002) ("(2) The [[Board of Immigration Appeals]]' authority under 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(c) (2002) to certify cases to itself in [[sua sponte|its discretion]] '''''is limited to exceptional circumstances''''', and is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the [[Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations|regulations]], where enforcing them might result in hardship.")

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5112">{{Politics of the Falkland Islands}}
A '''referendum on reforming the electoral system''' is scheduled to be held in the [[Falkland Islands]] on Thursday 7 November 2019.&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;{{cite news |title=Falklands: Referendum on Single Constituency on Thursday 7 November 2019 |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2018/08/29/falklands-referendum-on-single-constituency-on-thursday-7-november-2019 |accessdate=29 August 2018 |agency=[[MercoPress]] |date=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters will be asked if they want to replace the two existing [[Electoral district|electoral constituencies]]  ([[Camp (constituency)|Camp]] and [[Stanley (constituency)|Stanley]]) with a single constituency for the whole of the Islands.

==Background==
Under section 27 of the [[Falkland Islands Constitution]], any change to the constituencies on the islands must be supported in a referendum by at least two-thirds of those who are registered as electors in each constituency.&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Falkland Islands Constitution Order 2008 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/2846/pdfs/uksi_20082846_en.pdf#page=22 |publisher=gov.uk |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elections in the Falkland Islands]] are held every four years to elect eight members to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Assembly]] using [[multiple non-transferable vote]]. The [[Camp (constituency)|Camp constituency]] is currently heavily over-represented in the Legislative Assembly, electing three of the eight seats (38% of the total) with the remaining five seats being elected from the [[Stanley (constituency)|Stanley constituency]] (62.5%). However, according to the 2016 census, 87% of the islands' population live in Stanley, compared to 13% in Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2016 census report |url=https://falklandstimeline.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/falkland_islands_census_2016_-_report_without_data_tables.pdf |publisher=falklandstimeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the third time in 18 years that the Falkland Islanders will have been asked to vote on creating a single constituency for the whole of the Islands. The [[Falkland Islands electoral system referendum, 2001|first referendum]] was held on 22 November 2001, to coincide with that year's [[Falkland Islands general election, 2001|general election]], and asked "Do you agree that there should be a single constituency for the Falkland Islands, with a new voting system for proportional representation?". This was rejected by 56.65% to 43.35% overall and there were majorities against in both constituencies, with the 'No' vote in Camp being over 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklandnews.com/public/story.cfm?get=1045&amp;source=7 |title=Falklands Voters Polled on Single Constituency |author = J. Brock |publisher=The Falklands News Network |date=24 August 2001 |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Falkland Islands electoral system referendum, 2011|Another referendum]] was held ten years later on 3 November 2011, but this time only asked voters if they wanted a single constituency and did not include provisions for changing the voting system. The question was again rejected, this time by 58.78% to 41.22% overall. A narrow majority of voters in Stanley (50.2% to 49.8%) voted in favour but over 80% in Camp voted against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Falkland Islands voters overwhelmingly reject single constituency proposal |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2011/11/04/falkland-islands-voters-overwhelmingly-reject-single-constituency-proposal |accessdate=29 August 2018 |work=MercoPress |date=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, the Falkland Islands Government announced that another referendum on creating a single constituency would be held on 7 November 2019.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt; The date was chosen to allow sufficient preparation time for the referendum and also (in the event the referendum question is approved) have enough time to make appropriate amendments to the Electoral Ordinance and Constitution before the [[Falkland Islands general election, 2021|next election]], due in November 2021.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;

Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in [[Pakistan]] is a set of laws that permit the general population of Pakistan to access documents that are in possession of the federal and provincial governments.

== Constitutional structure ==
The [[1973 Constitution of Pakistan]] does not explicitly recognize citizens’ right to access information as it states that "every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression, and there shall be freedom of the press, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law”.  As Pakistan signed the International Covenant for Civil and Political rights (ICCR), it is required to issue its citizens such right. The right to access information was further specified in the 2010 constitutional amendment, which declared that under Article 19-A “Every citizen shall have the right to have access to information in all matters of public importance subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions imposed by law.”  Both federal and provincial governments issued various laws in order to allow Pakistani citizens to exercise their right to access public data.

== History ==
Pakistan was the first South Asian country to enact a law on freedom of information, when it passed the Freedom of Information (FOI) Ordinance at the Federal level in 1997. This Ordinance was later revoked and a new Freedom of Information Ordinance was issued in 2002, which has a legal status to this day as it was covered under the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|17th Amendment to the Constitution]].  In 2004, the Freedom of Information Rules 2004 were enforced by the Federal Government, which described the procedural aspect of the Freedom of Information Ordinance. In 2016, a draft of a new federal Right to Information (RTI) bill was proposed by Pakistan’s federal government in hopes of replacing the Freedom of Information Ordinance of 2002, but the approval of the bill is still pending.

== Federal ==
The FOI Ordinance authorizes Pakistani citizens to gain access to data held by the national government. The Ordinance only pertains to the Federal Government organizations and does not apply to any provincial governments or private entities funded by the national government. The Freedom of Information Rules 2004 details the procedure through which the governmental data can be requested: applicants must pay a fee and enclose the purpose of their inquiry by providing specific reasons as to why they need the information. If the requested information is not provided in 21 days, the applicant may file a complaint to the head of the public body. Only access to public records is permitted, which excludes such documents as notes, timings of meetings, personal bank account data, classified information, data pertaining to national security, etc. The draft of the federal RTI bill is not significantly different from the FOI Ordinance of 2004, however, it has a change in scope as the new bill is not restricted to only governmental organizations, but it also applies to non-governmental bodies that are funded or registered by the national government.

== Provincial ==
The FOI Ordinance of 2004 laid the basis for the following two provincial laws: The Baluchistan Freedom of Information Act in 2005 and Sindh Freedom of Information Act in 2006.  In addition, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Right to Information Act (KPK RTI) and the Punjab Transparency and Right to Information Ordinance were both passed in 2013. The KPK RTI Act covers not only official governmental bodies, but also non-governmental entities that are funded by the government (for example, locally funded public service organizations).  The Punjab RTI Act can be used not only by the citizens of Pakistan, but also by legal bodies that are registered within Pakistan territorial borders.

'''''Hamilton v. Regents of the University of California''''', 293 U.S. 245 (1934), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court upheld the "[[rights|right]] of [[California]] to [[force (law)|force]] its university students to take classes in [[military education and training|military training]]" and reiterated that "[i]nstruction in [[military science]] is not instruction in the practice or tenets of a religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Hamilton v. Regents of the University of California|volume=293|page=245|pin=266|year=1934}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/court/hami_v_rege.html The Religious Freedom Page summary], Library of the [[University of Virginia]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also held that the [[University of California]] constituted a corporation created by the state to administer the University, its president, and its provost,&lt;ref name=Hamilton250&gt;''Hamilton'', 293 U.S. at 250.&lt;/ref&gt; and as held &lt;!-- Williams v. Wheeler (1913) 23 Cal.App. 619, 623, 138 P. 937; Wallace v. Regents (1925) 75 Cal.App. 274, 277, 242 P. 892. --&gt; is a constitutional department or function of the state government and as such an order by the regents is in effect a statute or law of the state.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton'', 293 U.S. at 265.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Background ==
On March 23, 1868, the Legislature of California passed an act ([http://192.234.213.35/clerkarchive/archive/Statutes/1867/1867_68.pdf Stats. 1867-8], ch. 244, p. 248) creating the University "in order to devote to the largest purposes of education the benefaction made to the State" by the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]]. The act stated:&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton'', 293 U.S. at 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://192.234.213.35/clerkarchive/archive/Statutes/1867/1867_68.pdf Stats. 1867-8], ch. 244, section 6, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;and in order to fulfil the requirements of the said Act of Congress, all able-bodied male students of the University, whether pursuing full or partial courses in any college, or as students at large, shall receive instruction and discipline in military tactics in such manner and to such extent as the Regents shall prescribe, the requisite arms for which shall be furnished by the State.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On September 15, 1931, the regents promulgated an order requiring students to take the course in [[military science]] and tactics in the [[Reserve Officers Training Corps]] as prescribed by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton'', 293 U.S. at 250-51.&lt;/ref&gt; The order prescribed the following:&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton'', 293 U.S. at 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every able-bodied student of the University of California who, at the time of his matriculation at the University, is under the age of twenty-four years and a citizen of the United States and who has not attained full academic standing as a junior student in the University and has not completed the course in military science and tactics offered to freshmen and sophomore students at the University shall be and is hereby required as a condition to his attendance as a student to enroll in and complete a course in not less than one and one-half units of instruction in military science and tactics each semester of his attendance until such time as he shall have received a total of six units of such instruction or shall have attained full academic standing as a junior student.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October, 1933, several [[Minor (law)|minors]] belonging to the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] and of the [[Epworth League]] enrolled in the [[University of California]] system. The students at the beginning of the fall term in 1933 petitioned the University for exemption from military training and participation in the activities of the training corps, upon the ground of their religious and [[conscientious objection]] to war and to military training.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton'', 293 U.S. at 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The regents refused to make military training optional or to exempt these students.&lt;ref name=Hamilton250/&gt;

[[Connecticut]] is known as the "constitution state."  The origin of this title is uncertain, but the nickname is assumed to be a reference to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638–39 which represent the framework for the first formal government written by a representative body in Connecticut.  Connecticut's government has operated under the direction of five separate documents in its history. The [[Connecticut Colony]] at Hartford was governed by the Fundamental Orders, and the [[New Haven Colony|Quinnipiac Colony]] at New Haven had its own Constitution in ''The Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony'' which was signed on 4 June 1639.

In 1662, Connecticut was granted governmental authority and a royal charter by King [[Charles II of England]]. These two documents laid the groundwork for the state's government, but lacked characteristics of what is generally thought of as a constitution.&lt;ref name="Horton 1988"&gt;{{harvnb|Horton|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority.&lt;ref name="Horton 1988"/&gt; A true constitution was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Meghan, [http://www.cga.ct.gov/2008/rpt/2008-r-0296.htm "Connecticut Constitutional Conventions"], Connecticut General Assembly Office of Legislative Research, May 6, 2008. Retrieved 2016-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The current state constitution was implemented in 1965; it absorbed the majority of its 1818 predecessor and incorporated a handful of important modifications.

==Connecticut's foundation as a religious colony==
{{main|Fundamental Orders of Connecticut}}
{{wikisource|Fundamental Orders}}
The [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]] were adopted on January 14, 1639, and the document has often been referred to as the world's first written constitution.  At the urging of influential preacher [[Thomas Hooker]], the Connecticut legislative body (or General Court) began secret committee meetings to discuss drafting the orders in June 1638.  The Council completed its efforts by the beginning of 1639, and the Fundamental Orders became the cornerstone of government in Connecticut soon after.

Connecticut was founded by [[Congregationalists]] who split away from the [[Massachusetts colony]] between 1635 and 1636. The first settlers founded three towns on the [[Connecticut River]] in [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]], [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]], and [[Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Cohn 1988"&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main purposes of the Fundamental Orders was to formalize the relationship among these three towns.  The foundation of the Fundamental Orders incorporated the religious background of the colony's founders.  They called for "an orderly and decent government according to God" in attempts to pursue "the liberty and purity of the gospel of our Lord [[Jesus]]"&lt;ref&gt;The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut (1639)&lt;/ref&gt; and stipulated that "the Governor be always a member of some approved congregation".

[[New Haven Colony]] was separate at the time, and their [[Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony|Fundamental Agreement]] (1639) states that "church members only shall be free burgesses". Voting rights were further limited under the Fundamental Orders.  All males at least 21 years of age could become freemen (voters) if they met certain property qualifications.  In order to vote, the citizen must own real estate assessed at a yearly rental value of 40 shillings or own taxable property assessed at 40 pounds sterling.&lt;ref name="Horton 1988" /&gt;

==Separation of powers from 1639 to 1818==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
The governance of Connecticut developed over the roughly 180 years from the ideas presented by Rev. [[Thomas Hooker]] in 1638, to the Constitution of 1818. Connecticut's government had [[separation of powers]] as defined by the original ''Fundamental Orders'' of 1639, but with a strong single assembly. However, instead of having a Royally appointed governor, it elected its own and appointed its own judges.  It changed over the next 50 years into a bicameral legislature with a strong governor and a more independent judiciary.

The legislative body was the General Court, which began as a one-house legislature that wielded supreme authority.  The General Court split in 1698 and was renamed the General Assembly, although it continued to enjoy dominance over the executive and judiciary until 1818.  After the 1698 split, the General Assembly consisted of the houses of the Council and the Assembly.  The Council was the more powerful of the two houses, consisting of the governor and lieutenant governor ''ex officio'', and 12 elected assistants.  The 12 assistants were not elected from particular jurisdictions, but rather represented the state as a whole.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  The Council varied in number up to 200 members, with each town sending one or two representatives.

Initially, the position of governor was somewhat symbolic.  The executive had no power of pardon and no ability to veto bills passed by the General Assembly.  Under the Fundamental Orders, the maximum term for the governor was two years, and he could not succeed himself.  For many years, [[John Haynes (governor)|John Haynes]] and [[Edward Hopkins]] took turns with the position, each serving a two-year term and then rotating back to the role of lieutenant governor.  The primary responsibilities of the governor were as an official statesman and a member of the legislature.  Before the split into two houses, the governor acted as the moderator of the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Court]].  Afterwards, he held the spot on the Council.

In 1667, Sir [[Edmund Andros]] was sent by King James II to take control as governor of the [[Dominion of New England]], provoking the famous [[Charter Oak]] incident. As a result, the office of governor was made stronger; from the time of [[Robert Treat]] in 1689 to [[Jonathan Trumbull]] in 1776, there were only nine [[List of colonial governors of Connecticut|Connecticut governors]] with an average of 10 years in office. Connecticut became known as "the land of steady habits" for re-electing the same men over and over. Various wars also strengthened the position of the governor, who organized the militia.  The governorship was an extremely important role during the [[American Revolutionary War]] due to his position as commander-in-chief of the state militia.

Perhaps the least influential branch of government under the Fundamental Orders was the judiciary.  Until 1818, the legislative branch was the court of final resort in the state, holding [[appellate jurisdiction]] over all lower courts.  If a litigant was dissatisfied with the court's decision, he simply had to go to the legislature to request a review.  This often led to circumstances where a representative or assistant sat in review of a case in which he was personally interested as an attorney, litigant, or friend of one of the parties.  When it became too burdensome for the entire assembly to handle appeals, the Supreme Court of Errors was created in 1784.  Instead of being composed of the entire assembly, only the members of the Council sat as the Supreme Court of Errors.  This change failed to alleviate many of the conflict of interest problems inherent in the appellate process.

Under political pressure, the General Assembly changed the makeup of the Supreme Court of Errors in 1806.  Members of the Council no longer sat on the court; instead, the nine Superior Court judges acted as the Supreme Court of Errors when all of them sat together.  This created a judicial body, but the General Assembly still retained the power to reverse decisions of the court.  It also resulted in the constant situation of a Superior Court judge sitting in review of a case over which he had presided at the trial level.

A notorious instance of legislative interference with the courts occurred in 1815, when Peter Lung was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.  Lung filed a petition with the General Assembly and his conviction was overturned. The court retried him, convicted him—and promptly executed him.  ''Lung's Case'' outraged all Connecticut judges, most notably Chief Justice Zephaniah Swift, who spoke out for judicial independence in a pamphlet the following year.  Establishment of an independent judiciary became one of the central rallying cries in support of a new constitution.

==The Connecticut Charter of 1662==
The English Parliament restored the monarchy in 1660, and King Charles II assumed the English throne.  Connecticut had never been officially recognized as a colony by the British government, so the General Court determined that the independence of Connecticut must be legitimized.  Governor [[John Winthrop, Jr.]] was sent as an emissary to negotiate with the English government, and set sail for England on July 23, 1661.  He proved successful in his mission, and the English attorney general approved a bill for incorporation of the Connecticut Charter.  The document was returned to Connecticut after being officially sealed and registered, and was adopted by the General Court on October 9, 1662.

The Connecticut Charter displaced the Fundamental Orders and became the governing authority for the colony.  Its practical effect was minimal on the government, however, and Connecticut continued to operate much as it had under the Fundamental Orders.  The Charter did incorporate a few noteworthy changes.  All colonists in Connecticut were given "all liberties and immunities" of the realm of England.  The governor was granted the additional authority to convene a session of the General Court, while freemen were stripped of this ability.  The colony's borders were to be [[Narragansett Bay]] on the east and [[Massachusetts]] on the north, while its southwestern boundary was expanded to the "South Sea on the West", meaning the Pacific Ocean.  Connecticut's borders never approached this limitation, but the Charter did place the separate [[New Haven Colony]] within its jurisdiction. Several judges who had sentenced [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to death had subsequently been given refuge in New Haven, and Charles II may have been exacting revenge.  After a brief dispute, New Haven decided to voluntarily join Connecticut in 1665. Today the city of New Haven still maintains Three Judges Cave on [[West Rock]] as a tribute to the judges who hid from Charles II's agents.

==The Charter Oak==
[[Edmund Andros]] was appointed governor of New York in 1675 and promptly demanded that Connecticut Colony surrender their charter and fall under his authority. Connecticut refused to surrender it, and Andros waited until 1686, when he served a writ on the governor, again demanding the surrender of the charter; he finally went to [[Hartford]] with a band of soldiers on October 31, 1687.

The historical accuracy of what followed is somewhat uncertain, but the commonly accepted version is that Andros met with the leaders of the colony one night at the meetinghouse, expecting them to relinquish the charter. The charter was lying on a table when colonists suddenly blew out the candles, throwing the room into darkness; when the lights were reignited, it had vanished.  Joseph Wadsworth fled with the document and hid it in an oak tree on the Wyllys estate, and this tree became known as the [[Charter Oak]], a famous landmark in Connecticut.  The precise details of this account have never been confirmed, but it is certain that Andros never got his hands on the charter.

Despite this accomplishment, Andros briefly succeeded in forcing Connecticut to succumb to his rule, and the General Court of Connecticut declared itself dissolved.  Andros's reign ended after [[The Glorious Revolution]] took place in England in November 1688 when [[James II of England|James II]] was overthrown in favor of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]. Andros was deposed from power shortly after.

Connecticut was left with several options of how to restart its government.  Some advocated direct ties to the crown with a royal government, while others lobbied for drafting a completely new charter, but Connecticut finally opted to return to the status quo. The government under the Charter was reinstated, including the reinstatement of all leaders previously in place before the interruption. In May 1689, the General Court issued a declaration that "all the laws of this colony formerly made, according to the Charter, and Courts constituted in this colony for administration of justice as they were before the late interruption, shall be of full force and virtue for the future."  After reaching this conclusion, the colony petitioned the monarchy for approval of their return to operation under the charter.  In the meantime, New York Governor [[Benjamin Fletcher]] attempted to claim military authority over Connecticut. John Winthrop's son Fitz John went as the emissary to England as his father had done more than 30 years earlier in 1661, and he was successful in his mission. The Attorney General and Solicitor General reported to the king that the charter remained valid, and the king ratified it on April 19, 1694. This represented the end of serious challenges to Connecticut's autonomy.

==Connecticut governance after the Revolution==
The General Assembly formally approved the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] with the other colonies, especially since its own [[Roger Sherman]] had helped to draft it. The legislature declared in its resolution that Connecticut's government "shall continue to be as established by Charter received from Charles the second, King of England, so far as an adherence to the same will be consistent with an absolute independence of this State on the Crown of [[Great Britain]]".  Even in independence, Connecticut wished to remain governed in accordance with King Charles' Charter. Eleven of the [[thirteen colonies]] had drafted state constitutions by 1786, but Connecticut elected to continue operation under the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rhode Island]] was the only other colony not to draft a constitution by this point.&lt;/ref&gt;   Connecticut forged ahead under this scheme of government until 1818, when the first true constitution was adopted.

==The Constitution of 1818==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
In 1816, Connecticut was entirely in the control of the Federalist Party and the established Congregationalist Church. Connecticut was known as "the land of steady habits" for its custom of re-electing those in power until they died; the [[Democratic-Republican]] party had been organized in 1804, yet Connecticut remained the last holdout of the [[Federalist]] party in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|2013|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the last state to effectively have an established state religion and a Constitution going back to the days of the British Empire. In 1815, Episcopalians, Baptists, Methodists, and members of other dissident denominations to the established Congregationalist church combined with the Democratic-Republican party to form the [[Toleration Party]].  In 1816, they held a convention and ran a slate of candidates. In 1817, they took control of the state Assembly (lower house), and elected [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr.]] as Governor and [[Jonathan Ingersoll]] as Lieutenant-governor.

In 1639, a year after the founding of the state, the Rev. [[Thomas Hooker]] gave a sermon that formed the basis of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]], the first state Constitution.  Since then, an "Anniversary Election Sermon" was given at the [[First Church of Christ and the Ancient Burying Ground|Center Church]] in Hartford to celebrate the fusion of church and state.  A procession of militia, assemblymen, and clerics from all over the state would move through Hartford; then a prominent cleric would preach a political sermon to the assembly. One measure of the event's importance is the attention given to the sometimes long-winded sermons; President [[Ezra Stiles]] of Yale preached one in 1783 that lasted five hours and was 99 pages when printed.&lt;ref name="Olsen 2013, p. 63"&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|2013|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Wolcott knew that the Toleration Party would soon have the votes to take a slim majority in the upper house, after the spring elections of 1818. He asked Episcopalian Rev. Harry Croswell to give the politically important Anniversary Election Sermon the next year, an event that signaled the end of the Standing-Order in Connecticut.  Croswell was a former Federalist crusading journalist who had been sued for seditious libel by the Jefferson-party in New York in the famous ''[[People v. Croswell]]'' case. He had entirely abandoned politics for religion; he was now the Rector of the large and influential [[Trinity Church on the Green]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. But he did not give the expected triumphant political sermon, or yet another standard election sermon of the sort that had been delivered since almost the founding of Connecticut in 1638. Instead, he gave an Election sermon in the spring of 1818 that strongly insisted on the total separation of church and state.  Croswell's sermon had strong and immediate impact. It was ordered printed in an unprecedented four editions around the state. Croswell had been a newspaper editor during a time when paper was scarce and space was tight; his sermon was only 11 pages when printed, or about 30 minuets long when preached.&lt;ref name="Olsen 2013, p. 63"/&gt;

The General Assembly met just after the unusually short Anniversary Election Sermon was delivered and made a significant change to [[voting rights]] in Connecticut.  All males who paid taxes or served in the militia were deemed eligible to vote.  This eliminated the previous property requirements that had grown onerous, as more of the population moved to jobs in commerce or manufacturing rather than agriculture.

Even more significantly, the General Assembly also called for a constitutional convention that year. The most important ballot cast in the General Assembly was the vote on whether only a [[Majority|simple majority]] of the [[legislature]] would be required to approve whatever constitution was ultimately drafted. Many favored requiring anywhere from a sixty to eighty percent majority for adoption of a new government.

It seems that Croswell's well-received and powerful short sermon was efficacious;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|2013|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; those in favor of a simple majority carried the vote by 81–80. Thus a single-vote margin passed the resolution vital to the future success of the constitution that disestablished the state church, separated church and state, and ended the last theocracy in America.

Each town sent a number of [[delegates]] equal to the number of representatives held in the Assembly.  The convention convened in Hartford on August 26, 1818.  As one of the first orders of business, a twenty-four man committee was appointed to prepare a draft constitution.  The very next day, the committee returned with the Preamble and Bill of Rights.  Their speed was not due to ingenuity.  The draft was borrowed almost verbatim from the constitution that [[Mississippi]] had created a year earlier in 1817.  After the remainder of the constitution was drafted, the convention approved the document by a two-to-one margin on September 16, 1818.  The voters were given three weeks to consider the proposed constitution. A vote was held on October 5.  A small majority cast their ballots in favor of the constitution, with the resolution passing 13,918 to 12,364.  The ultimate vote proved the importance of requiring only a simple majority's approval, for a sixty or eighty percent requirement would not have been met.

As a result of the new constitution, the [[Congregational Church]] was finally disestablished, although Christianity remained the constitutionally favored religion. Newly received voting rights were also solidified, as the convention provided constitutional rights to vote for all males who paid taxes or had served in the militia. With the 1818 Constitution, separation of powers was finally brought to Connecticut government. An independent judiciary was approved. Both Supreme and Superior Court judges were now given life tenure to the age of seventy (this was changed to eight years in 1856). The Supreme Court of Errors was reduced to five judges, with each judge retaining a role as a Superior Court judge. Decisions of the court could no longer be appealed to the legislature.

The constitution did not significantly change the role of the executive, and the branch remained relatively weak.  The executive did became a constitutional and independent part of the government, however.  The governor was no longer granted a seat in the legislature.  He was granted the new power of veto, but any of his vetos could be overruled by a simple majority vote from the Assembly.  This made the [[veto power]] essentially useless since any bill would have to pass both houses by a majority anyway.  The General Assembly retained the authority to [[nominate]] judges under the new constitution.  This was not changed until 1880, when nomination powers were transferred to the governor.

The legislative branch also experienced a few changes. The Council was renamed the Senate.  By constitutional mandate, half the legislative sessions were to take place in [[Hartford]] with the other half convening in [[New Haven]].  Surprisingly, the method in which towns were assigned a number of representatives was left unchanged.  Each town predating the constitution retained two representatives in the lower house regardless of population, with the exception of several newer towns which were granted one vote.  Many amendments were added over the years, but the Constitution of 1818 remained in operation until 1965.  There was also a Constitution of 1955, but it merely incorporated prior amendments into the main body of the constitution.

==Constitution of 1965==
{{main|Constitution of Connecticut}}
Connecticut currently operates under the constitution passed in 1965.  The primary purpose of the 1965 constitutional convention was reapportionment of the representatives in the lower legislative house.  Assigning each town one or two representatives had resulted in grossly disproportional representation.  Small rural towns enjoyed equal representation with large urban communities.  Apart from this major change, a majority of the language from the 1818 Constitution was reaffirmed verbatim or almost verbatim in 1965.  Non-Christians were finally granted official freedom of religion in 1965, although a law had been passed by the legislature in 1843 which recognized [[Jews]]' right to worship, though these laws were largely ignored following large-scale Jewish and Catholic immigration in the last half of the 19th century.  The reference to [[Christianity]] from the earlier constitution was deleted.  After 1965, the Supreme Court of Errors' title was changed to the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]].  The executive obtained a significant power under the new constitution.  The governor still does not enjoy the privilege of [[pardon]], but the office was granted a more significant power of veto under the latest constitution.  Instead of being able to be overridden by a second majority vote, the legislature now must muster two-thirds support in both houses to defeat a veto.  Also of note, the 1965 Constitution includes a constitutional right to free [[public education]].  In addition, the most recent constitution has provided a mechanism to convene future constitutional conventions if necessary.

The Constitution of 1965 remains the supreme authority in Connecticut today.  It represents the fourth distinct document in state history laying out the mechanics for its form of government.  Connecticut is known as the Constitution State because of its early adoption of the Fundamental Orders in 1639, thought to be the earliest document of its kind in [[western world|western civilization]].  Since that time Connecticut has undergone several constitutional crises and alterations, which have led the state to its present state of affairs today.

'''''Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc.''''', 581 U.S. ___ (2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Impression Prods., Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.|link=|volume=581|year=2017|docket=15-1189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on the [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|exhaustion doctrine]] in [[patent]] law in which the Court held that after the sale of a patented item, the patent holder cannot sue for patent infringement relating to further use of that item, even when in violation of a contract with a customer or imported from outside the United States. The case concerned a patent infringement lawsuit brought by [[Lexmark]] against Impression Products, Inc., which bought used [[ink cartridge]]s, refilled them, replaced a microchip on the cartridge to circumvent a [[digital rights management]] scheme, and then resold them. Lexmark argued that as they own several patents related to the ink cartridges, Impression Products was violating their patent rights. The U.S. Supreme Court, reversing a 2016 decision of the [[Federal Circuit]], held that the exhaustion doctrine prevented Lexmark's patent infringement lawsuit, although Lexmark could enforce restrictions on use or resale of its contracts with direct purchasers under regular contract law (but not as a patent infringement lawsuit). Besides printer and ink manufacturers, the decision of the case could affect the markets of high tech consumer goods and prescription drugs.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

==Background==

===Factual setting===

[[File:Lexmark_toner_cartridge_drawing_from_U.S._Pat._No._5,802,431.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Drawing of toner cartridge from one of Lexmark's patents]]

Lexmark International, Inc. makes and sells printers and toner cartridges for its printers. Lexmark owns a number of patents that cover its cartridges and their use. Lexmark sold the cartridges at issue in this case—some in the United States and some abroad.

==== Domestic sales ====

Lexmark's domestic sales were in two categories. A "Regular Cartridge" is sold at "list price" and confers an absolute title and property right on the buyer.{{efn|This litigation does not involve these domestically sold cartridges.}} A "Return Program Cartridge” is sold at a discount of about 20 percent, and is subject to post-sale restrictions: The buyer may not reuse the cartridge after the toner runs out and may not transfer it to anybody else. The first branch of the case turns on the legal status of these post-sale restrictions.

Lexmark manufactured the toner cartridges with microchips in them, which send signals to the printers indicating toner level. When the amount of toner in a cartridge falls below a certain level, the printer will not operate with that cartridge. Also, the printer will not operate with a Return Program Cartridge that has been refilled by a third party. Thus, Lexmark's technology prevented violation of the post-sale restriction against refilling the Return Program Cartridges. The Regular Cartridges do not have this anti-refill feature and can therefore be refilled and reused (but they cost 20 percent more).{{efn|It was stipulated that the 20% price difference "reflects the value of the property interest and use rights conveyed to the purchaser under the express terms of the conditional sale contract and conditional single-use license conferred by Lexmark."}}

“To circumvent this technological measure,” however, “third parties have ‘hacked’ the Lexmark microchips. They created their own "unauthorized replacement" microchips that, when installed in a Return Program cartridge, fool the printer into allowing reuse of that cartridge. Various companies{{efn|For example, Static Control Components, Inc., which became involved in related litigation with Lexmark. See, e.g., ''[[Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.|Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.]]'', 487 F. Supp. 2d 830 (E.D. Ky. 2007).}} purchase used Return Program Cartridges from the customers who bought them from Lexmark. They replace the microchips with "unauthorized replacement" microchips, refill the cartridges with toner, and sell the "re-manufactured" cartridges to resellers such as Impression Products for marketing to consumers for use with Lexmark printers. Lexmark had previously argued in ''[[Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.]]'' that replacing these microchips violated copyright law and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), but both federal and the Supreme Court have ruled against Lexmark, affirming that replacing the microchips is not in violation of copyright.

====Imported cartridges====

The second branch of the case involves cartridges that Lexmark sold outside the US. While some of the foreign-sold cartridges were Regular Cartridges and some were Return Program Cartridges, this branch of the case does not involve any distinction among the two types of imported cartridges.

===Trial court decision===

The district court granted Impression's motion to dismiss Lexmark's claim of infringement involving the single-use cartridges Lexmark had first sold in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Ink Techs. Printer Supplies, LLC'', 2014 WL 1276133 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The district court concluded that the Supreme Court in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;553 U.S. 617 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  found exhaustion where “the Supreme Court determined that the agreements [at issue] broadly authorized Intel [the seller] to sell the licensed products without restrictions or conditions."&lt;ref&gt;2014 WL 1276133, at *5.&lt;/ref&gt; The district court said “that ''Quanta'' overruled ''Mallinckrodt'' ''sub silentio'',” and therefore "those post-sale use restrictions do not prevent patent rights from being exhausted given that the initial sales were authorized and unrestricted." &lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court held, however, that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply to the cartridges that Lexmark had sold abroad. It said that international exhaustion did not apply to patents because ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.'', 568 U.S. __, 133 S. Ct. 1351 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;, which established international exhaustion in at least some cases, applied only to copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Ink Techs. Printer Supplies, LLC'', 9 F. Supp. 3d 830, 833-34 (S.D. Ohio 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The court therefore denied Impression's motion to dismiss Lexmark's claim of infringement involving the cartridges Lexmark had sold abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 838.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government ''amicus curiae'' position===

In its ''amicus curiae'' brief, the US Government argued that ''Mallinckrodt'' had been wrongly decided in 1992 and in any case it had been overruled ''sub silentio'' in ''Quanta''. It stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the view of the United States, the first authorized sale of a patented article in the United States wholly exhausts the patentee’s exclusive rights in that article, notwithstanding any post-sale restriction imposed by the patentee.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The government also argued that the decision of ''[[Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States International Trade Commission]]'' (2001) should be partially overruled in light of ''Kirtsaeng'' insofar as it held that foreign sales can ''never'' exhaust US patent rights. When the patentee neither makes nor authorizes a foreign sale, as occurred in ''[[Boesch v. Graff]]'',&lt;ref&gt;133 U.S. 697 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; it is proper to say no exhaustion occurred. But when the patentee makes or authorizes a foreign sale, and fails expressly to reserve its US rights, then exhaustion should be found. In the present case, Lexmark made the foreign sales and failed to expressly reserve its US rights; therefore, the sale exhausted the patent rights.

[[File:Active_and_senior_judges_of_the_Federal_Circuit_2016.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Judges of the Federal Circuit]]

==Federal Circuit decision==
[[File:Fed. Cir. oral argument. 2014-1617 Lexmark International, Inc. v. Impression Products, Inc.ogg|thumb|Federal Circuit oral argument on March 6, 2015.]]
[[File:Fed. Cir. oral argument. 2014-1617 Lexmark International, Inc. v. Impression Products, Inc. (Re-argument en-banc).ogg|thumb|Federal Circuit re-argument en banc on October 15, 2015.]]
The parties each appealed.  After a three judge panel had heard oral argument the Federal Circuit ''[[sua sponte]]'' set the case for argument ''en banc'' in the first instance and invited the filing of ''amicus curiae'' briefs.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Impression Prods., Inc.'', 785 F.3d 565 (Fed. Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majority opinion===

Judge Taranto, writing for a 10-2 majority, reaffirmed both of the prior Federal Circuit rulings. In summary, the court held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, we adhere to the holding of ''[[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;976 F.2d 700 (Fed. Cir. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; that a patentee, when selling a patented article subject to a single-use/no-resale restriction that is lawful and clearly communicated to the purchaser, does not by that sale give the buyer, or downstream buyers, the resale/reuse authority that has been expressly denied. Such resale or reuse, when contrary to the known, lawful limits on the authority conferred at the time of the original sale, remains unauthorized and therefore remains infringing conduct under the terms of §&amp;nbsp;271. Under Supreme Court precedent, a patentee may preserve its §&amp;nbsp;271 rights through such restrictions when licensing others to make and sell patented articles; ''Mallinckrodt'' held that there is no sound legal basis for denying the same ability to the patentee that makes and sells the articles itself. We find ''Mallinckrodt''’s principle to remain sound after the Supreme Court’s decision in ''Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.''&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;553 U.S. 617 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Second, we adhere to the holding of ''[[Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States International Trade Commission|Jazz Photo Corp. v. International Trade Comm’n]]'',&lt;ref&gt;264 F.3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; that a U.S. patentee, merely by selling or authorizing the sale of a U.S.-patented article abroad, does not authorize the buyer to import the article and sell and use it in the United States, which are infringing acts in the absence of patentee-conferred authority. ''Jazz Photo''’s no-exhaustion ruling recognizes that foreign markets under foreign sovereign control are not equivalent to the U.S. markets under U.S. control in which a U.S. patentee’s sale presumptively exhausts its rights in the article sold. A buyer may still rely on a foreign sale as a defense to infringement, but only by establishing an express or implied license—a defense separate from exhaustion, as ''Quanta'' holds—based on patentee communications or other circumstances of the sale. We conclude that ''Jazz Photo''’s no-exhaustion principle remains sound after the Supreme Court’s decision in ''Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;– U.S. –, 133 S.Ct. 1351 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Court did not address patent law or whether a foreign sale should be viewed as conferring authority to engage in otherwise-infringing domestic acts. ''Kirtsaeng'' is a copyright case holding that 17 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;109(a) entitles owners of copyrighted articles to take certain acts “without the authority” of the copyright holder. There is no counterpart to that provision in the Patent Act, under which a foreign sale is properly treated as neither conclusively nor even presumptively exhausting the U.S. patentee’s rights in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;- F.3d at -.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Domestic exhaustion====

In this part of its opinion, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed its ''Mallincrodt'' decision and rejected contentions that ''Quanta'' had silently overruled it.

=====§&amp;nbsp;271 abrogates common-law rule=====

The court began by distinguishing the Patent Act's and Copyright Act's respective approaches to infringement. in 17 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;109(a) the Copyright Act says, "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3)," defining infringement by selling, a purchaser "is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession" of a purchased copy of a work. In contrast, the Patent Act contains no exhaustion provision. Therefore, the Patent Act requires a "conferral of 'authority' by the patentee .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. in order for the actions listed in §&amp;nbsp;271(a) not to constitute infringement." This means there must be "permission from the patentee" to avoid infringement. The court does not accept exhaustion as a form of "constructive" permission. Hence, if the patentee places explicit limits or conditions on its permission, they qualify the scope of the permission. This has the effect of limiting the common law.

=====''General Talking Pictures'' rule applies to "conditional" sale=====

The court turned to the ''General Talking Pictures'' decision,{{efn|''General Talking Pictures Corp v Western Electric Co.'', 304 U.S. 175, 182 (1938) (upholding as legitimate field-of-use limitations on scope of patent licenses to make and sell amplifiers only in “non-commercial” field), aff’d on reh’g, 305 U.S. 124 (1938).}} which holds "that Lexmark would not have exhausted its patent rights in those cartridges, upon the manufacturing licensee’s sale (the first sale), if a buyer with knowledge of the restrictions resold or reused them in violation of the restrictions." Although the government in its ''amicus curiae'' brief and defendant Impression argue "that a different result is required—that Lexmark automatically lost its patent rights—simply because Lexmark sold the Return Program cartridges itself, subject to the same communicated restriction, rather than having left the manufacture and sale to others under license," the court does not accept that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We conclude otherwise, as we did in ''Mallinckrodt'' and subsequent decisions. A sale made under a clearly communicated, otherwise-lawful restriction as to post-sale use or resale does not confer on the buyer and a subsequent purchaser the "authority" to engage in the use or resale that the restriction precludes. And there is no sound reason, and no Supreme Court precedent, requiring a distinction that gives less control to a practicing-entity patentee that makes and sells its own product than to a non-practicing-entity patentee that licenses others to make and sell the product.{{efn|But see ''[[United States v. General Electric Co.]]'', in which the Court stated that it was well settled that “where a patentee makes the patented article and sells it, he can exercise no future control over what the purchaser may wish to do with the article after his purchase. It has passed beyond the scope of the patentee's rights.” On the other hand, the Court said, “the question is a different one ... when we consider what a patentee who grants a license to one to make and vend the patented article may do in limiting the licensee in the exercise of the right to sell.”}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====''Quanta'' distinguishable and inapplicable=====

The court turned to the ''Quanta'' decision and found it inapplicable to the present issues. "'Quanta did not involve a patentee’s sale at all, let alone one subject to a restriction or, more particularly, a single-use/no-resale restriction." Rather, ''Quanta'' involved a patentee's (LGE's) license to a manufacturer (Intel) that sold to the accused infringer (Quanta). LGE had not limited Intel's license to manufacture the patented product, although it imposed contractual obligations on Intel. "No conditions limited Intel’s authority to sell products substantially embodying the patents." The Federal Circuit emphasized: "There were no patentee sales, and there were no restrictions on the sales made by the licensee." Those facts were removed from the case at bar. Thus the ''Quanta'' "Court’s discussion of that issue does not undermine ''Mallinckrodt''&amp;#8202;’s ruling that a patentee can preserve its patent rights through restrictions on its sales." The Federal Circuit also emphasized as significant the failure of the ''Quanta'' Court to explicitly repudiate ''Mallinckrodt'' despite the fact that in its ''amicus'' brief "the government prominently featured an argument that ''Mallinckrodt'' was incorrect and should be repudiated."

=====Prior cases=====

The court then turned to the prior Supreme Court cases. Reviewing them, it found that although they used sweeping language that a patentee's sale of the patented product placed it beyond the reach of the patent, so that no post-sale restriction could be enforced under the patent laws, that language went beyond the actual facts of the cases. First, the sales were in most cases without any condition or restriction on what the buyer might do with the product. Second, in the cases where an explicit condition or restriction was imposed, the case involved a tie-in or a price-fix.

The Court conceded that in the ''[[United States v. General Electric Co.|General Electric]]'' case, the Supreme Court had said: “It is well settled, as already said, that where a patentee makes the patented article, and sells it, he can exercise no future control over what the purchaser may wish to do with the article after his purchase. It has passed beyond the scope of the patentee’s rights.” But that case involved an antitrust challenge to GE's distribution of lamps that did not meet that description. The case involved price restrictions on a licensed manufacturer. The Federal Circuit then explained that the word "settled" in the Supreme Court's statement had a special, narrow meaning:
"We read that language to deem 'settled' only what was settled in the cited precedents—a patentee’s sales ''without restrictions'' exhaust patent rights in the item sold." Thus, the Supreme Court's sweeping exhaustion language applies precedentially only to cases in which either the sale was without condition or restriction or else the sale was made with a tie-in or price-fixing condition. "But the Court did not rule that all restrictions on a patentee’s sale were ineffective to preserve the patentee’s patent-law rights."

Similarly, in ''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]'', the Supreme Court's sweeping language must now be limited to the factual context of the case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moreover, although some language in ''Univis'',  like language in other decisions in the area, can be taken out of context and read as going beyond the specific restrictions involved, the most the Court ruled, even as to patent law all by itself, was that a vertical price-control restriction was ineffective to preserve patent rights after sales of articles embodying the patents. While ''Univis'' is controlling on what it decided on the issues before it, we do not think it appropriate to give broad effect to language in ''Univis'', taken out of context, to support an otherwise-unjustified conclusion here on a question not faced there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Federal Circuit therefore drew this conclusion from the past series of Supreme Court cases on exhaustion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the foregoing reasons, we think that the best lesson to draw from the Supreme Court’s precedents, as applied to the question before us, is that a patentee may preserve its patent rights by otherwise-proper restrictions when it makes and sells patented articles itself and not only when it contracts out manufacturing and sales.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Patent law trumps common law=====

The Federal Circuit returned to the common law and Lord Coke's commentary on it. Again, the court insisted that Congress had overridden the common law's prohibitions on post-sale restraints, in order to promote technological progress:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hatever considerations might go into a jurisdiction’s choice as to the background rule for personal property in general, lawmaking authorities may reasonably make different choices for particular kinds of property. Notably, as to intellectual property in its various forms, Congress, implementing the Constitution, has long deemed it important to incentivize creation and disclosure through grants to the creator of rights to exclude others for a time.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. That overriding legislative prescription removes the patented-article sale from the scope of Lord Coke’s 1628 description of his country’s general judicially fashioned property law.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. In short, notwithstanding Lord Coke’s description of English general personal-property judge-made law, the patent-specific statutory analysis must govern here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Likely effects on public=====

The court then turned to what it called "the likely real-world consequences of one answer or another to the exhaustion question presented here." The court noted that in ''Kirtsaeng'' the Supreme Court had envisioned serious adverse effects on competition unless Coke's 1628 property law rules were followed. The Federal Circuit said that did not apply to patents:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e see no basis for predicting the extreme, lop-sided impacts the Court found plausible in ''Kirtsaeng'' in different circumstances. ''Mallinckrodt'' has been the governing case law since 1992 and has been reiterated in subsequent precedent. And yet we have been given no reliable demonstration of widespread problems not being solved in the marketplace. Given ''General Talking Pictures'', the only question is about patentees’ ability to do for their own sales what they already can do by contracting out their manufacturing and sales. Regarding the specific scenario we are addressing today—in which the patentee has sought to preserve its patent rights by conditioning its first sale on a single-use/no-resale restriction of which the accused infringer had adequate notice at the time of purchase—we have been given no proof of a significant problem with enforcing patent rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, the Federal Circuit maintained, the conduct challenged here can have benefits. Under Lexmark's program, customers who agree to the restriction pay a lower price than those who do not. It could be that the companies that refill the cartridges use inferior products that could harm the Lexmark machines, which "could harm Lexmark’s reputation." To assume that the restrictions are illegitimate would run counter to the trends "over the last four decades, that have displaced the strict condemnation of various vertical restrictions that characterized" earlier antitrust and patent-misuse law in the first part of the twentieth century. “Field-of-use, territorial, and other limitations on intellectual property licenses may serve procompetitive ends by allowing the licensor to exploit its property as efficiently and effectively as possible.” Therefore, the court concluded it is appropriate to apply to post-sale restrictions the same tolerance that the ''General Talking Pictures'' doctrine accords limitations in manufacturing licenses.

====International exhaustion====

In this part of its opinion, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed it ''Jazz Photo'' opinion and rejected contentions that ''Kirtsaeng'' had undermined the basis for ''Jazz Photo''. The Federal Circuit insisted that "''Kirtsaeng'' says nothing about patent law."

The court emphasized the differences between patent law and copyright law. For example, patent law gives patentees an exclusive right to use of the invention but copyright law gives no general exclusionary right as to use (it gives exclusive public performance and display "use" rights, but not others). Also, it is much more costly and time-consuming to obtain a patent than a copyright. The court did not explain, however, the way that or other differences between copyrights and patents called for contrary results as to international exhaustion.

The court did say that the US patent statute gives patentees the reward available from "sales in American markets, not from sales in foreign markets." A sale in a foreign market therefore does not furnish a proper basis for finding exhaustion. "American markets differ substantially from markets in many other countries, and not just because of disparities in wealth that can lead to dramatically different prices" in this country and abroad (as was the case in ''Kirtsaeng''). "Government policies differ dramatically, including policies on price regulation and, most particularly, policies on the availability and scope of patent protection." The court did not explain further, however, whether and how such dramatic differences in policy applied to the toner cartridges at issue in the present case.

The court then turned to the only Supreme Court case on foreign exhaustion, ''Boesch v. Graff''.&lt;ref&gt;133 U.S. 697 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, Graff was the assignee of a US patent. Boesch bought the product from a German supplier who had a prior-user right under German law to make and sell the product, because the supplier had begun activity before the application for the German counterpart patent was filed. The US assignee and the inventor had no connection with Boesch. When Graff imported the product into the US, Boesch sued for infringement. The US courts found Boesch liable. The rights that Boesch had under German law did not entitle him to import the product into the US. That is governed by US law. The US patentee had never "received any royalty or given any license to use the patented article in any part of the United States."
Accordingly, the court held, a foreign sale does not of its own force authorize importation into the US.

This does not mean, however, that a patentee by its conduct cannot waive its US rights, be estopped from asserting them, or be found to have granted an implied license.

The court expressed concern that overruling ''Jazz Photo'' would harm the US drug industry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There seems to be no dispute that U.S.-patented medicines are often sold outside the United States at substantially lower prices than those charged here and, also, that the practice could be disrupted by the increased arbitrage opportunities that would come from deeming U.S. rights eliminated by a foreign sale made or authorized by the U.S. patentee.There seems to be no dispute that U.S.-patented medicines are often sold outside the United States at substantially lower prices than those charged here and, also, that the practice could be disrupted by the increased arbitrage opportunities that would come from deeming U.S. rights eliminated by a foreign sale made or authorized by the U.S. patentee.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, the court rejected a proposal that exhaustion should be presumed unless the patentee express states that it reserves its US rights. Foreign governments might "prohibit sellers from stating reservations of rights that would make importation into and sale in the United States more difficult." Also: "Intermediary companies between the foreign purchase and the importation into the United States may be created that make it difficult for the U.S. patentee to carry an affirmative burden of proving adequate notice of reservations attached to a foreign-sold article."

===Dissenting opinion===

Judge Dyk, joined by Judge Hughes, dissented from both branches of the court's exhaustion analysis. Judge Dyk summarized his dissent in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would overrule our decision in ''Mallinckrodt'' as inconsistent with governing Supreme Court authority and overrule ''Jazz Photo'' to the extent that it imposes a blanket ban on foreign exhaustion. I would recognize foreign exhaustion where the U.S. rights holder has not notified the buyer of its retention of the U.S. patent rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Domestic exhaustion====

In this part of the dissent, Judge Dyk argued that the majority had misunderstood the Supreme Court's exhaustion jurisprudence in order to substitute its own ideas of the proper balance between patent rights and public rights. He began by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, I agree with the government that ''Mallinckrodt'' was wrong when decided, and in any event cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court’s recent decision in ''Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.''&lt;ref&gt;553 U.S. 617 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; We exceed our role as a subordinate court by declining to follow the explicit domestic exhaustion rule announced by the Supreme Court.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He argued that since 1850 the Supreme Court has held that a sale by the patentee or its licensee exhausts all patent rights. In such cases, "The question of whether the seller has 'authorized' the buyer to use or resell the item is simply irrelevant." Post-sale restrictions could not be enforced under federal patent law. The only Supreme Court case to depart from that principle was ''[[Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;224 U.S. 1 (1912).&lt;/ref&gt; and it was explicitly overruled five years later by ''[[Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. 502, 518 (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of the overruled ''Dick'' case that a patentee could impost a post-sale restriction by giving a buyer notice of it was "the same as the panel’s holding in ''Mallinckrodt'' and the majority’s holding in this case."

He insisted that the majority opinion misread the ''Motion Picture Patents'' decision by asserting "that it only 'held particular restrictions improper' .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. but 'did not rule that all restrictions on a patentee’s sale were ineffective to preserve the patentee’s patent-law rights.'" He explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That is not accurate. ''Motion Picture Patents'' did not leave behind the remnants of ''A.B. Dick''—minus tie-ins and resale price maintenance. To the contrary, the Court in ''Motion Picture Patents'' found that “[t]he patent law furnishes no warrant for” the restrictions imposed by the patent owner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later cases, such as ''Quanta'', confirmed this "broad patent exhaustion rule [in ''Motion Picture Patents''] and left no room for a resurrection of ''A.B. Dick''."

He next turned to the majority's referenced to "conditional sales" and "unconditional sales," and said that the majority misconstrued the terms. "Conditional sales," he said, as used in pre-''Mallinckrodt'' case law referred only to the retention of title for a security interest in installment purchases. "In other words, a sale with restrictions could nonetheless be an 'unconditional' sale in which title passes, with the restrictions invalid under the patent laws because of exhaustion."

He then criticized the majority for making up special rules for patent cases that differed from the common law and general legal principles, citing Supreme Court admonitions not to do that--"The Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed us not to ignore traditional legal principles to fashion rules 'unique to patent disputes.'"{{efn|He cited as examples: ''eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.'', 547 U.S. 388, 393 (2006); ''Global–Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A.'', 563 U.S. 754 (2011); ''MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.'', 549 U.S. 118, 132 n. 11 (2007).}}

Finally, Judge Dyk took issue on multiple grounds with the majority's efforts to distinguish and limit the Supreme Court's rulings. "The majority’s justifications for refusing to follow Supreme Court authority establishing the exhaustion rule misconceive our role as a subordinate court." Each justification in the majority decision was unsupportable, he said.

* "First, the majority characterizes the statement of the exhaustion rule in the Supreme Court cases as mere dictum because in those cases there was either no restriction imposed or the restriction would otherwise violate the antitrust laws. But the cases impose no such qualification on the rule announced. The Supreme Court has repeatedly advised the courts of appeals that our task is to follow the rules proclaimed by the Court, and not to attempt to distinguish Supreme Court cases on their facts."
* "Second, the majority relies on 35 U.S.C. §§&amp;nbsp;271(a) and 154(a)(1) to suggest that a broad reading of the exhaustion doctrine is inconsistent with statutory language making an act of infringement .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. any use or sale of a patented invention 'without authority' of the patent owner, and providing the patent owner with a 'right to exclude.'" But the patent exhaustion doctrine is a limitation on the operation of those sections, and applies notwithstanding them.
* "Third, the majority claims that giving full sweep to the articulation of the exhaustion doctrine in Quanta and other cases would be inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in ''[[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.]]'' .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The majority suggests it would be incongruous if 'a patentee cannot preserve its patent rights against uses of a patented article .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. if, instead of licensing someone else to make and sell the article, it chooses to make and sell the article itself.'&amp;#8239;”

:But ''General Talking Pictures'' was a case of a license to manufacture in a limited field,  not a sale with a post-sale restriction. The cases recognize that distinction. Thus, in ''Quanta'' the Supreme Court stated that ''General Talking Pictures'' "held that exhaustion did not apply because the manufacturer had no authority to sell the amplifiers for commercial use.”&lt;ref&gt;553 U.S. at 636.&lt;/ref&gt; And where the manufacturer in that case (Intel) did have a general authority to make and sell, the Supreme Court held that exhaustion applied to the sale.

:The majority found "tension" between "the Supreme Court’s broad statement of the exhaustion rule and ''General Talking Pictures''" and sought to resolve it by extending the rule of ''General Talking Pictures'' and contracting the exhaustion doctrine in the area of possible conflict. But, Dyk maintained:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t is not our task to ignore Supreme Court rulings as "unjustifi[ed]" or "unsound" because they are purportedly inconsistent with other Supreme Court cases. The distinction between restrictions on sales (impermissible) and restrictions on licensees (permissible) exists in the Court’s precedent, and it is not for us to decide if it is a sound distinction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* "Finally, the majority proposes that we should somehow sustain the restriction here because it may be pro-competitive. Exhaustion does not turn on whether a particular post-sale restriction is desirable or undesirable, pro-competitive or anti-competitive, but whether the sale was authorized and the item has passed beyond the scope of the patent monopoly." Furthermore, the Supreme Court said in ''Kirtsaeng'' that a prohibition on resale is "manifestly anti-competitive."&lt;ref&gt;''Kirtsaeng'', 133 S.Ct. at 1363.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyk concluded his discussion of domestic exhaustion with the statement: "There is, in sum, no colorable basis for the majority’s failure to follow the exhaustion rule for domestic sales as articulated by the Court in ''Quanta'' and numerous other cases."

====International exhaustion====

In this part of the dissent, Judge Dyk argued for a nuanced balance that called for different results depending on whether the patentee was responsible for the sale abroad that was alleged to trigger exhaustion.

He began by pointing out that because Lexmark's foreign sales were made without any restrictions or reservations, "even under the majority’s cramped view of exhaustion, there is no question that the sales would have exhausted Lexmark’s domestic patent rights. The issue is whether the foreign location of the sale should lead to a different result, as we previously held in ''Jazz Photo''."

He then turned to "the centerpiece of the majority’s holding that there is a doctrinal blanket ban on foreign exhaustion, namely the Supreme Court’s decision in ''Boesch v. Graff''.&lt;ref&gt;133 U.S. 697 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; But "''Boesch'' announced no such blanket ban," he said. "It did not even involve an authorized sale by the holder of U.S. patent rights but rather a sale by a third party under a foreign law’s prior use exception."{{efn|Under German law, the defendant had a ''prior user right'' to use the invention because it had begun to do so before the patentee filed its patent application.}} But "''Boesch'' does not apply here because the foreign sales were made by Lexmark."

In every US lower court decision before ''Jazz Photo'': "When the sale was made by an entity not holding U.S. patent rights, as in ''Boesch'', or when the authorized foreign seller clearly reserved U.S. rights, there was no exhaustion." In contrast, "where the foreign sale was made by a seller holding U.S. patent rights without a contractual reservation of U.S. rights, exhaustion occurred as a result of an authorized foreign sale."

Dyk maintained that "''Kirtsaeng'' provides significant guidance and cannot be dismissed as simply a copyright case, or as limited to the 'first sale' provision of the Copyright Act." Rather, the policies that animated ''Kirtsaeng'' typically apply to patent exhaustion. But because in some cases a difference may be significant, there should be abalanced approach. Dyk argued for "put[ting] the burden on the U.S. rights holder to provide notice of a reservation of U.S. rights to the purchaser." Thus, he "would recognize foreign exhaustion where the U.S. rights holder has not notified the buyer of its retention of the U.S. patent rights."

==Supreme Court==
In March 2016, Impression filed a petition for ''[[certiorari]]'' in the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Impression-Products-v.-Lexmark-cert-petition-no-appendix.pdf Petition for a Writ of Certiorari], ''Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc.'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1189.htm No. 15-1189].&lt;/ref&gt; Impression presented these questions in its petition:&lt;ref&gt;Br. Pet. at ''i''.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1. Whether a "conditional sale" that transfers title to the patented item while specifying post-sale restrictions on the article’s use or resale avoids application of the patent exhaustion doctrine and therefore permits the enforcement of such post-sale restrictions through the patent law’s infringement remedy.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2. Whether, in light of this Court’s holding in ''Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.'', 133 S. Ct. 1351, 1363 (2013), that the common law doctrine barring restraints on alienation that is the basis of exhaustion doctrine "makes no geographical distinctions," a sale of a patented article—authorized by the U.S. patentee—that takes place outside of the United States exhausts the U.S. patent rights in that article.

[[File:SCOTUS Oral Argument. 15-1189. Impressions Products, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.ogg|thumb|Supreme Court oral argument 03/21/17]]

===Majority===
A unanimous Court{{efn|Justice Gorsuch joined the Court after oral arguments were heard and took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', syllabus at 5.&lt;/ref&gt;}} found that Lexmark exhausted its patent rights upon first sale domestically, even with the single-use/no-resale restrictions imposed by Lexmark in contracts with its customers, although such restrictions could be enforced under contract law.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court noted that the exhaustion doctrine has a long history&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 5-9.&lt;/ref&gt; and that any change would have significant effects on commerce in the modern world, noting that "extending the patent rights beyond the first sale would clog the channels of commerce, with little benefit from the extra control that the patentees retain,"&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; noting that complex modern [[supply chain]]s can involve large numbers of patents.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 8 (citing [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/15-1189-tsac-Costco-et-al.pdf Brief for Costco Wholesalers, Corp. et al.] as ''[[Amicus curiae|Amicus Curiae]]'' at 7-9; [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Intel-Vizio-Amicus-Brief-as-Filed.pdf Brief for Intel, Corp. et al.] as ''Amicus Curiae'' at 17, n. 5).&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Citing, ''inter alia'', an [[Amicus curiae|''amicus'' brief]] filed by [[Intel]] that a generic smartphone could practice an estimated 250,000 patents.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Chief Justice Roberts, in his opinion, compared the situation to automobile repair shops: "The business works because the shop can rest assured that, so long as those bringing in the cars own them, the shop is free to repair and resell those vehicles. That smooth flow of commerce would sputter if companies that make the thousands of parts that go into a vehicle could keep their patent rights after the first sale."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/business/supreme-court-patent-rights-lexmark.html | title = Supreme Court Rules Patent Laws Can’t Be Used to Prevent Reselling | first1=  Adam | last1 = Liptak | first2=Vindu | last2=Goel | date = May 30, 2017 | accessdate = May 30, 2017 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven justices joined the Court's opinion extending that reasoning to items imported from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', syllabus at 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 13-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Lexmark had argued, and the Federal Circuit agreed, that sale abroad "does not trigger patent exhaustion unless the patentee 'expressly or implicitly transfers or licenses' its rights."&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 13 (quoting [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/15-1189-respondent-merits.pdf Brief for Respondent] 36-37)(some internal punctuation marks removed).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court, however, ruled that "[a]n authorized sale outside the United States, just as one within the United States, exhausts all rights under the Patent Act."&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court relied on its 2013 decision in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'' on a nearly identical issue under copyright law. Because the underlying statute was not clear as to its geographical scope, the Court in ''Kirtsaeng'' decided that, because the statute was based in the common law exhaustion doctrine, which is not limited in geographic extent, the statute at issue was therefore not intended to be limited to only U.S. sales.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the same principle to patent law, which historically has a close connection with copyright law, was "straightforward"&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the bond between [copyright and patent law] leaves no room for a rift on the question of international exhaustion".&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial dissent===
Justice Ginsburg dissented from the Court's holding with respect to imported items. Adhering to substantially the same reasoning of her dissent in ''Kirtsaeng'', Justice Ginsburg argued that because patent law is territorial and the sale of an item abroad is "independent[] of the U.S. patent system, it makes little sense to say that such a sale exhausts an inventor's U.S. patent rights."&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).&lt;/ref&gt; She would have upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that sale abroad does not exhaust a patentee's rights in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 2-3 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gerstein===

Robert M. Gerstein concluded that further review in the Supreme Court was likely:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Given the Supreme Court’s interest in patent cases, a vigorous dissent in ''Lexmark'' that relies on a number of Supreme Court precedents, including ''Quanta'' and ''Kirtsaeng'', and the position of the Justice Department that ''Quanta'' overruled ''Mallinckrodt'', it would not be surprising to see the Supreme Court take up Lexmark in its next term.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Gerstein, [http://www.marshallip.com/publications/federal-circuit-sidesteps-supreme-court-twice-in-exhaustion-ruling/ ''Federal Circuit Sidesteps Supreme Court Twice in Exhaustion Ruling''] (Feb. 15, 2016).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dodd and Dowd===

Jeff C. Dodd and Matthew J. Dowd viewed the decision as an affirmation of strong patent rights:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Lexmark'' embraces a very strong view of patent rights and a narrow view of the scope of exhaustion. It affirms that patent holders have wide latitude to segment and control distribution in the market channels for products covered by patents. This latitude is particularly wide with respect to limiting the import into the United States of patented goods sold in authorized sales in foreign markets even where restrictions on resale were not proven to have been communicated to foreign buyers. Even so, the court left open the possibility that foreign sales, under the right circumstances, may incorporate an implied license to import and use the product within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff C. Dodd and Matthew J. Dowd, [https://www.andrewskurth.com/insights-1307.html ''The En Banc Federal Circuit Holds That Patent Rights Are Not Exhausted by Prior Restricted Sales or by Foreign Sales''] (Feb. 19, 2016).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Cukierski and Masia===

Kevin J. Cukierski and Adam H. Masia see the decision as "pro-patent owner" but warn again premature celebration:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But take caution—it is likely that the Supreme Court will be asked to hear the case. Given the tension between this case and the Supreme Court’s language in ''Quanta'' and ''Kirtsaeng'', along with the discord at the district court level and among commentators before the Federal Circuit’s decision, there’s a good chance the Supreme Court will do so. Until the Supreme Court has its say, you should take precautions in case the Supreme Court takes an expansive view of patent exhaustion and decides to remove these exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Cukierski and Adam H. Masia, [http://www.ngelaw.com/Patent-Exhaustion/ ''Federal Circuit Affirms Pro-Patent Owner Limits on Patent Exhaustion''] (Feb. 16, 2015),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="Without Precedent"===

Another commentator (unsigned comment) indicated a skeptical view of the Federal Circuit's tendency to march to a different drummer. After quoting Judge Dyk's admonition, “We exceed our role as a subordinate court by declining to follow the explicit domestic exhaustion rule announced by the Supreme Court,” he (or she) observed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For present purposes, it is simply worth noting that the Federal Circuit appears to be inching closer again to the concept that patent law is simply a unique beast, with unique rules and requirements. The Supreme Court has taken a skeptical view of that approach in the past. And may well again.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brannlaw.com/ip-wise/without-precedent/ ''Without Precedent''] (Feb. 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Jahn, Pichler, and Lo===

Paul Jahn, Rufus Pichler and Lincoln Lo raise many questions (mostly about "clear communication") about what the ''Lexmark'' majority opinion left unresolved:

* Conflict or tension with Quanta: "''Quanta'' expressly distinguished implied licenses and exhaustion, holding that disclaimers of license rights are 'irrelevant' where 'the right to practice the patents is based not on implied license but on exhaustion.'&amp;#8239;" But "the Federal Circuit appears to treat exhaustion like an implied license—one that the patentee can disclaim by 'clearly communicate[d]' restrictions." ''Quanta'' appears to hold that the patentee's attempt to impose a post-sale restriction on a manufacturing licensee is ineffective if the license does not conform to the ''General Talking Pictures'' case.
* "[W]hat arrangement between a seller and buyer is sufficient to deny 'authority.'? It was undisputed in ''Lexmark'' that there was 'an express and enforceable contractual agreement' between Lexmark and each end-user, and that the no-resale and no-reuse restrictions were binding on end users.  Yet throughout the ''Lexmark'' opinion, the majority suggests that restrictions may be sufficient if 'clearly communicated'—even if well short of a contractual meeting of the minds."
* Another way to put this is what is a "clear communication"? In ''Jazz Photo'', the Federal Circuit noted that the “package instructions [were] not in the form of a contractual agreement by the purchaser to limit reuse of the cameras.”  Accordingly, “There was no showing of a ‘meeting of the minds’ whereby the purchaser, and those obtaining the purchaser's discarded camera, may be deemed to have breached a contract or violated a license limited to a single use of the camera.”&lt;ref&gt;''Jazz Photo'', 264 F.3d at 1108.&lt;/ref&gt; The writers conclude, therefore, "It is unclear if the Federal Circuit intended an expansion of the patentee-seller’s ability to avoid exhaustion."
* Also, how clear must a "clear communication" be? "The Federal Circuit appears to limit infringement claims against subsequent downstream buyers to those 'having knowledge of the restrictions.' The appellate court did not elaborate on what defenses a subsequent downstream purchaser ''without knowledge'' may have, assuming no exhaustion. The court only mentions in passing that 'we do not have before us the questions that would arise, whether under principles governing ''bona fide'' purchasers or otherwise, if a downstream re-purchaser acquired a patented article with less than actual knowledge of the restriction.'&amp;#8239;"
* Finally, does the court's focus on “clear communication” have a negative impact on post-sale restrictions that a limited licensee under ''General Talking Pictures'' is required to impose? "The Federal Circuit suggested repeatedly that buyers’ knowledge of the licensee's field of use limitation may be required for a licensee's sale to be non-exhaustive. While ''General Talking Pictures'' did not clearly resolve this question, many licensors have assumed that sales by a licensee outside of its licensed field are unauthorized altogether and are therefore non-exhaustive regardless of the purchaser's knowledge of the field of use limitation." Therefore, does the emphasis, here "on the buyer’s knowledge, even if ''dicta'', add to the uncertainty concerning this issue"?&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jahn, Rufus Pichler, and Lincoln Lo. [http://www.mofo.com/resources/publications/2016/02/160222restrictedsales ''Federal Circuit Holds that Restricted Sales and Foreign Sales Do Not Exhaust Patent Rights''] (Feb. 22, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castanias, Nix, and Kazhdan===

Gregory A. Castanias, Kelsey I. Nix, and Daniel Kazhdan also point to unresolved issues over which patent owners "must still be cautious":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Lexmark'' explicitly left open several fact-specific questions, including (i) what happens if someone acquires a patented article with "less than actual knowledge" of the restrictions placed on the original sale by the patent owner and (ii) when would a foreign buyer have an "implied license" to sell in the United States, independent of patent exhaustion. These issues will surely be raised in future cases.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Castanias, Kelsey I. Nix, and Daniel Kazhdan, [http://www.jonesday.com/ien-banci-federal-circuit-reaffirms-that-foreign-sales-and-restricted-domestic-sales-dont-exhaust-patent-rights-02-17-2016/ '' En Banc Federal Circuit Reaffirms that Foreign Sales and Restricted Domestic Sales Don't Exhaust Patent Rights''] (Feb. 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Crouch===

Dennis Crouch, in ''Patently-O'' commented on the issues and provided a summary of the merits briefs filed in the Supreme Court as of January 31, 2017. Crouch opposed the Federal Circuit's ruling on these grounds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;With personal property courts long ago rejected servitudes (such as use and resale restrictions) that bind subsequent purchasers. Unlike real property, personal property moves and is often transferred without substantial paperwork or record-keeping, and allowing a set of unique restrictions has the potential of gumming up the marketplace.  The Federal Circuit in this case went all the way to the other side — holding that the presumption in foreign sales is that no US patent rights are exhausted.  I purchased my last couple of smart phones through the used market – and have also repaired them several times.  Under the law, I probably should have taken steps to ensure that all of the original equipment manufacturers affirmatively granted repair and resale rights.  Coming together, the Federal Circuit’s approach here has the potential to limit the market for the repair and reselling of goods.  I would suggest that those activities are incredibly beneficial to our society in terms of resource allocation and avoiding waste as well as empowering citizens and avoiding anticompetitive market behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Crouch, [http://patentlyo.com/patent/2017/01/resale-prevent-arbitrage.html ''Can Your Patent Block Repair and Resale and Prevent Arbitrage?''], {{smallcaps|Patently-O}} (Jan. 31, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Distinguish|text = a [[secret trial]], whose existence is unknown to the public}}

'''''In camera''''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ŋ|ˈ|k|æ|m|r|ə|,_|-|m|ə|r|ə}}; [[Latin]]: "in a chamber")&lt;ref name=uscourts&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.uscourts.gov/Common/Glossary.aspx | title = Glossary | publisher = USCourts.gov }}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[law| legal]] term that means ''in private''.&lt;ref name = Amo /&gt; The same meaning is sometimes expressed in the English equivalent: '''''in chambers'''''. Generally, ''in-camera'' describes [[court]] cases, parts of it, or process where the public and press are not allowed to observe the procedure or process.&lt;ref name= Amo&gt;{{Citation | first = Eugene | last = Ehrlich | title = Amo, Amas, Amat and More | page = 151 | ISBN = 0-06-272017-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''In-camera'' is the opposite of [[trial]] [[in open court]] where all parties and witnesses testify in a public [[courtroom]], and [[Lawyer|attorneys]] publicly present their arguments to the [[trier of fact]].

==''In camera'' hearings during trials==
Entire cases may be heard ''in-camera'' when, for example, matters of [[national security]] are involved. ''In-camera'' review by a judge may be used during otherwise open trials—for example, to protect trade secrets or where one party asserts privilege (such as [[attorney–client privilege]]d communications).  This lets the judge review documents in private to determine if revelation of documents in open court will be allowed.

In United States courts in-camera review describes a process or procedure where a judge privately looks at confidential, sensitive, or private information to determine what, if any, information may be used by a party or made public. An ''in camera review'' may be at someone's request (such as counsel in the case), or by order of the court. 

An example of "in-camera review" by the court: a defendant prosecuted for the alleged murder of a high school student asserts his was an act of self-defense, a last resort after the deceased physically assaulted the defendant. Witnesses tell investigators and lawyers that the victim "was always getting into fights in school" and frequently had to visit the principal's office. The defendant seeks to obtain the deceased's high school files to see if there's anything proving the deceased fighting at school. A party for the deceased's family might argue against disclosure on the basis that school records which are presumably private should not be provided to the defendant. While a judge might acknowledge the general presumption, the court might permit the defendant limited use at trial any school records that may establish the deceased's physically aggressive tendencies. 

In this example, before allowing disclosure of files to the defendant, or for revelation of the records to the jury, the judge would "in camera" inspect the deceased's high school records to determine what records, if any, the judge will release to the defendant. Note: The judge has complete authority on an in-camera review. The judge may disallow use of some or all of the records reviewed, limit use or purpose, and to order a party to take all steps necessary to keep private and confidential the information released. 

==Non-legal definitions==
''In-camera'' can also describe closed board meetings that cover information not recorded in the minutes or divulged to the public. Such sessions may discuss personnel, financial, or other sensitive decisions that must be kept secret (e.g., a proposed merger or strategic change the organization does not want disclosed to competitors). It can also apply to diplomatic and political affairs, such as during the American [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787 when the drafting of the [[Constitution of the United States]] was discussed in such strict privacy so delegates could negotiate in full confidence that they were free to reconsider particular positions as necessary without embarrassment or political repercussions with their constituents. 

''In camera'' may also mean the portion of a graduate level thesis examination that includes only the examining committee and the student.  This follows a presentation by the student that the public may attend.

'''Intangible property''', also known as '''incorporeal property''', describes something which a [[Natural person|person]] or [[corporation]] can have ownership of and can transfer ownership to another person or corporation, but has no physical substance, for example brand identity or knowledge/[[intellectual property]].  It generally refers to statutory creations such as [[copyright]], [[trademark]]s, or [[patent]]s.  It excludes tangible property like [[real property]] (land, buildings, and [[Fixture (property law)|fixtures]]) and [[personal property]] (ships, automobiles, tools, etc.).  In some jurisdictions intangible property are referred to as ''choses in action''.  [https://www.royaltyrange.com/home/blog/what-are-intangibles Intangible] property is used in distinction to [[tangible property]].  It is useful to note that there are two forms of intangible property: legal intangible property (which is discussed here) and competitive intangible property (which is the source from which legal intangible property is created but cannot be owned, extinguished, or transferred).  Competitive intangible property disobeys the intellectual property test of voluntary [[extinguishment]] and therefore results in the sources that create intellectual property (knowledge in its source form, collaboration, process-engagement, etc.) escaping quantification.

Generally, ownership of intangible property gives the owner a set of legally enforceable rights over reproduction of personal property containing certain content&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.royaltyrange.com/home/blog/what-are-intangibles|title=What are intangibles? {{!}} RoyaltyRange|website=www.royaltyrange.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  For example, a copyright owner can control the reproduction of the work forming the copyright.  However, the intangible property forms a set of rights separate from the tangible property that carries the rights.  For example, the owner of a copyright can control the printing of books containing the content, but the book itself is personal property which can be bought and sold without concern over the rights of the copyright holder.

In [[English law]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] legal systems, intangible property is traditionally divided in ''pure intangibles'' (such as debts, intellectual property rights and [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]]) and ''documentary intangibles'', which obtain their character through the medium of a document (such as a [[bill of lading]], [[promissory note]] or [[bill of exchange]]).  The recent rise of [[electronic document]]s has blurred the distinction between pure intangibles and documentary intangibles.

'''Italian irredentism in Nice''' was the political movement supporting the annexation of the [[County of Nice]] to the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. The term was coined by [[Italian irredentism|Italian Irredentists]].

According to some [[nationalism|Italian nationalists]] and [[Fascism|fascists]] like Ermanno Amicucci, [[Italian language|Italian]]- and [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]]-speaking populations of the County of Nice ({{lang-it|Nizza}}) formed the majority of the county's population until the mid-[[19th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Amicucci, Ermanno. ''Nizza e l’Italia''. p 64&lt;/ref&gt; However, French nationalists and linguists argue that both [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and Ligurian languages were spoken in the County of Nice.

During the [[Italian unification]], in 1860, the [[House of Savoy]] allowed the [[Second French Empire]] to annex Nice from the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in exchange for French support of its quest to unify Italy. Consequently, the Niçois were excluded from the Italian unification movement and the region has since become primarily [[French language|French-speaking]].

== History ==
The region around ''Nicaea'', as Nice was known in Latin, was inhabited by the [[Ligures]] until its occupation by the [[Roman Empire]]. The Ligures were conquered by [[Augustus]] and, according to [[Theodor Mommsen]], fully [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanised]] by the [[4th century]], when the invasions of the [[Migration Period]] began.

The [[Franks]] conquered the region after the fall of Rome, and the local Romance language speaking populations became integrated within the County of Provence, with a period of independence as a maritime republic (1108–1176). In 1388, the [[Comune|commune]] of Nice sought the protection of the [[Counts and dukes of Savoy|Duchy of Savoy]], and Nice continued to be controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Savoy monarchs right up until 1860.

During this time, the maritime strength of Nice rapidly increased until it was able to cope with the [[Barbary pirates]]. Fortifications were largely extended by the [[House of Savoy]] and the roads of the city and surrounding region improved. [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]], abolished the use of [[Latin]] and established [[Italian language|Italian]] as the official language of Nice in 1561.&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Mettler, Hans &amp; Éthier, Benoit ''Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur'' (1998) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Conquered in 1792 by the armies of the [[French First Republic]], the County of Nice was part of France until 1814; but after that year it was placed under the protection of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] by the [[Congress of Vienna]].

By a treaty concluded in 1860 between the Sardinian king and [[Napoleon III]], the County of Nice was again ceded to France, along with Savoy, as a territorial reward for French assistance in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] against Austria, which saw Lombardy unified with Piedmont-Sardinia.

[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], born in Nice, strongly opposed the cession to France, arguing that the plebiscite that ratified the treaty was not "universal" and contained irregularities. He was elected at the "French National Assembly" for Nice with 70% of the votes in 1871, and quickly promoted the withdrawal of France from Nice, but the elections were invalidated by the French authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://storage.canalblog.com/76/72/572678/57843167.png The Times on the 1871 riots in Nice]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871/72 there were popular riots in the city (called by Garibaldi ''Vespri Nizzardi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrè|first=Giuseppe|authorlink=Giuseppe André|title=Nizza, negli ultimi quattro anni|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24ouAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA334|year=1875|publisher=A. Gilletta|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Nizzard Vespers), promoted by the "Garibaldini" in favour of unification with the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, J. Woolf. ''Il risorgimento italiano'' p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen Nizzardi Italians were processed and condemned for these riots, supported by the 'Nizzardo Republican Party'&lt;ref&gt;André, G. ''Nizza, negli ultimi quattro anni'' (1875) p. 334-335&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Plan-Nice-1624.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Nice]] in 1624, when it was called ''Nizza'']]

More than 11,000 Nizzardi Italians refused to be French and moved to Italy (mainly [[Turin]] and [[Genoa]]) after 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comune.torino.it/cittagora/article_10165.shtml Italian exiled from Nizza:"Quelli che non vollero diventare francesi" (in Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101003436/http://www.comune.torino.it/cittagora/article_10165.shtml |date=2012-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The French government closed the Italian language newspapers ''Diritto di Nizza'' and ''Voce di Nizza'' in 1861, and ''Il Pensiero di Nizza'' in 1895. In these newspapers wrote the most famous writers in [[Italian language]] of Nice: Giuseppe Bres, [[Henri Sappia]], Giuseppe André.

One of the most renowned Nizzardo Italians was Luciano Mereu, a follower of Garibaldi. On November 1870 he was temporarily exiled from Nice together with the "Garibaldini" Adriano Gilli, Carlo Perino and  Alberto Cougnet.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Alberto Cougnet to Giuseppe Garibaldi, Genova, 7 dicembre 1867,"Archivio Garibaldi", Milano, C 2582)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Luciano Mereu was elected in 1871 as counselor of Nizza under Mayor Augusto Raynaud (1871–1876) and was member of the ''Commissione garibaldina di Nizza'' with Donato Rasteu, its President until 1885.

[[Benito Mussolini]] considered the annexation of Nice to be one of his main targets. In 1942, during [[World War II]], after [[Operation Torch]] (the landing of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]  in [[North Africa]]), the former County of Nice was [[Italian occupation of France|occupied and administered by Italy]] from November 11, 1942 until September 8, 1943.

The Italian occupation government was far less severe than that of [[Vichy France]]. Therefore, thousands of [[Jews]] took refuge there. For a while the city became an important centre for various Jewish organizations. However, when the Italians signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] with the Allies, German troops invaded the region on September 8, 1943 and initiated brutal raids. [[Alois Brunner]], the SS official for Jewish affairs, was placed at the head of units formed to search out Jews. Within five months, 5,000 Jews were caught and deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paldiel|first=Mordecai|authorlink=Mordecai Paldiel|title=Saving the Jews: Amazing Stories of Men and Women who Defied the "final Solution"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRdUvDLC3pgC&amp;pg=PA281|year=2000|publisher=Schreiber|isbn=978-1-887563-55-0|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was returned to France following the war and in 1947, the areas of [[La Brigue]] and [[Tende]], which had remained Italian after 1860 were ceded to [[French Fourth Republic|France]]. Thereafter, a quarter of the Nizzardi Italians living in that mountainous area moved to [[Piedmont]] and [[Liguria]] in Italy (mainly from the [[Roya (river)|Roya Valley]] and Tenda).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intemelion.it Intemelion]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, after a sustained process of [[Francization]] conducted since 1861, the former county is predominantly French-speaking. Only along the coast around [[Menton]] and in the mountains around Tende there are still some native speakers of the original [[Intemelio dialect]] of Ligurian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intemelion.it Intemelion 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the area is part of the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] department of France.

[[File:Contea di Nizza.JPG|thumb|300 px|right|A map of the [[County of Nice]] (''Nizza'' in Italian) showing the area of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] annexed in 1860 to France (plain light brown) with the actual borders of the department of Alpes-Maritimes (light brown line)]]

Before the year 1000 the area of Nice was part of the Ligurian League, under the [[Republic of Genoa]]; the population spoke a dialect different from the one of western Liguria, whereas in the eastern part the language, which today is called Intemelio&lt;ref&gt;Werner Forner.''À propos du ligurien intémélien - La côte, l'arrière-pays'', Travaux du Cercle linguistique de Nice, 7-8, 1986, pp. 29-62.&lt;/ref&gt; was spoken. The medieval writer and poet [[Dante Alighieri]] wrote in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' that the [[Var (river)|Var]] near Nice was the western limit of the Italian Liguria.

Around the [[12th century]], Nice came under the control of the French [[Capetian House of Anjou]]. They favoured the immigration of peasants from [[Provence]], who brought with them their [[Occitan language]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Ezio. ''Le terre nostre ritornano... Malta, Corsica, Nizza''. Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; From 1388 to 1860, the County of Nice was under Savoyard rule and remained connected to the Italian dialects and peninsula. In the fantastic linguistics and historical inventions of the Italian fascists, in this era, the people of the mountainous areas of the upper Var Valley started to lose their former Ligurian linguistic characteristics and began to adopt Provençal influences. They believe that in those centuries the local [[Niçard dialect]] became distinct from the [[Monégasque dialect|Monégasque]] of the [[Principality of Monaco]].

Traditionally, Italian linguists maintained that Niçard originated as a Ligurian dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Zuccagni-Orlandini, Attilio. ''Raccolta di dialetti italiani con illustrazioni etnologiche'' 1864&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, French linguists argue that Niçard is a dialect of Occitan&lt;ref&gt;Bec, Pierre. ''La Langue Occitane''. pag 58&lt;/ref&gt; while conceding that Monégasque is a dialect of Ligurian. However, Sue Wright notes that before the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] ceded the County of Nice to [[France]], "Nice was not French-speaking before the annexation but underwent a shift to French in a short time... and it is surprising that the local Italian dialect, the Nissart, disappeared quickly from the private domain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gubbins|first1=Paul|last2=Holt|first2=Mike|title=Beyond Boundaries: Language and Identity in Contemporary Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2WyS7i9UxowC&amp;pg=PA91|year=2002|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=978-1-85359-555-4|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote that one of the main reasons of the disappearance of the Italian language in the County was because "(m)any of the administrative class under Piedmont-Savoy ruler, the soldiers; jurists; civil servants and professionals, who used Italian in their working lives, moved [back] to Piedmont, after the annexation and their places and roles were taken by newcomers from France".

Indeed, immediately after 1861, the French government closed all the Italian language newspapers and more than 11,000 Nizzardi Italians moved to the Kingdom of Italy. The dimension of this exodus can be deducted by the fact that in the Savoy census of 1858, Nice had only 44,000 inhabitants. In 1881, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Before the French annexation, the Niçois were quite as much Italian as the Genoese and their dialect was if anything, nearer the Tuscan, than is the harsh dialect of Genoa.&lt;ref&gt;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/03/29/98551254.pdf New York Times, 1881&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] defined his "Nizzardo" as an Italian dialect, albeit with strong similarities to Occitan and with some French influences, and for this reason promoted the union of Nice to the Kingdom of Italy.

Today some scholars, like the German Werner Forner, the French Jean-Philippe Dalbera and the Italian Giulia Petracco Sicardi, agree that the Niçard has some characteristics - phonetic, lexical and morphological - that are typical of western Ligurian. The French scholar Bernard Cerquiglini pinpoints in his ''Les langues de France'' the actual existence of a Ligurian minority in Tende, [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]] and [[Menton]].

Another reduction in the number of the Nizzardi Italians happened after [[World War II]], when defeated Italy was forced to surrender to France the small mountainous area of the County of Nice, that had been retained in 1860. From the ''Val di Roia'', Tenda and Briga one quarter of the local population moved to Italy in 1947.

In the century of [[nationalism]] between 1850 and 1950, the Nizzardi Italians were reduced from the 70% majority &lt;ref&gt;Amicucci, Ermanno. ''Nizza e l’Italia''. pag 126&lt;/ref&gt; of the 125,000, living in the County of Nice at the time of the French annexation, to an actual minority of nearly two thousand (in the area of [[Tende]] and [[Menton]]) today.

Nowadays, the populations of Nice and its surroundings are fluent in [[French language|French]], but a few of them still speak the original Niçard language of ''[[Nissa La Bella]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3133">'''Judicial activism''' is said to be the overreaching or incorrect interpretation of the law, which are thought by critics to be a misuse of the power of interpretation of the law by a [[judge]] or judges for political or personal reasons.

==Overview==

Judges in Canada are given the power to interpret law passed down from the legislature, discretionary power to resolve disputes, and the power to use [[common law]] and accepted judicial policy to render judgement. By the principle of [[separation of powers]], a strong tradition in Canada and accepted practice, judges should respect the role of the legislature to create law. Judges are also charged to impartially apply the law as it is written.

Canada has a [[Law of Canada|legal system]] that is derived from British system of common law (and the French system in the province of Quebec). [[Court system of Canada|Canadian Courts]] have a structure that relies more heavily on the discretion of its judges, policy and common law to create a workable body of law. Thus Canada's legal system may have more potential for conflicts with regards to the accusation of [[judicial activism]], as compared to the United States. 

Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada Beverley McLachlin stated that:

:''the charge of judicial activism may be understood as saying that judges are pursuing a particular political agenda, that they are allowing their political views to determine the outcome of cases before them. ... It is a serious matter to suggest that any branch of government is deliberately acting in a manner that is inconsistent with its constitutional role.''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060717004216/http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/aboutcourt/judges/speeches/DemocraticRoles_e.asp]

Such accusations often arise in response to rulings involving the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Specifically, rulings that have favored the extension of gay rights, have prompted accusations of judicial activism. Justice [[Rosalie Abella]] is a particularly common target of those who perceive activism on the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] bench.

The recent judgment  ''[[Chaoulli v Quebec]]'' [2005] 1 R.C.S. which declared unconstitutional the prohibition of private healthcare insurance, and challenged the principle of Canadian [[universal health care]] in Quebec was deemed by many as a prominent example of judicial activism. The judgment was written by Justice Deschamps with a tight majority of 4 against 3.

The '''Liechtensteinische Landesbibliothek''' (in [[English language|English]]: ''Liechtenstein State Library'') is the [[legal deposit]] and [[copyright]] library for [[Liechtenstein]].

==Legal basis and tasks==
The Liechtenstein State Library, locally known as the State Library, was established by law in 1961 by the National Library Foundation. The State Library possesses a legal depository. Aside from forming the library itself, the National Library Foundation also provides librarians’ commissions. The governing board members are appointed by the national government, which also acts as the supervisory body of the Foundation. 
The State Teachers Library, founded in 1906, was incorporated as a separate department via elected decision by the teachers’ conference three-member Commission and also by the State Board of Education. 
The Office of the Librarian, which governs the National Library Foundation, amended the statutes for the separation. The amended statutes changed the roles of the State Library; it now functions as a national library as well as a scientific and public library. As a national library, the State Library collects print materials, pictures and music created by national citizens, as well as items related to Liechtenstein. The State Library also acts as a patent library for Liechtenstein and as such provides access to comprehensive international patent information. The State Library’s rules and regulations must follow the current legislation under Liechtenstein’s European Economic Area as well as Swiss legislation.&lt;ref name=law&gt;[http://www.landesbibliothek.li Establishment Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library inventory==
As of 2012, the State Library contained about 250,000 items, with nearly 130,000 loans out to 3,956 library patrons. 2,524 of these patrons are from Liechtenstein and 1,432 people are from the local region. In 1999, the State Library’s online library system joined with [[Ex Libris Group#History|Ex Libris’ Aleph 500]]. This automated tracking system provides the library catalogues for every public library in and outside of the Liechtenstein region. The State Library is an associate member of the Information Network of German Switzerland. In addition, the State Library is participating in the Dandelon.com project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dandelon.com/intelligentSEARCH.nsf/fmQSF?OpenForm ''dandelon.com'' (website)]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Liechtenstein State Library is scanning their materials for online access; this also includes materials which the [[University of Liechtenstein]] donated to the library in 2003.

In August 2012 the State Library mounted Project eLiechtensteinesia, which provides online access to scans of the Yearbook of the Historical Society for the Principality of Liechtenstein, old national newspapers, and other publications from Liechtenstein.&lt;ref name=law/&gt;

'''Civil rights leaders''' are influential figures in the promotion and implementation of [[political freedom]] and the expansion of personal [[civil liberties]] and [[civil rights|rights]]. They work to protect individuals and groups from [[political repression]] and [[discrimination]] by governments and private organizations, and seek to ensure the ability of all members of society to participate in the civil and political life of the [[State (polity)|state]]. 

Civil rights include [[individual rights]] to equal protection and service, [[privacy]], [[freedom of thought]], [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of movement|freedom to travel]], [[freedom of religion|freedom of worship]], protection of [[civil liberties]], the [[right to vote]], and the right to freely share ideas and opinions through all forms of communication and [[freedom of the press|media]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6538">In [[business]] or [[commerce]], an '''order''' is a stated intention, either spoken or written, to engage in a commercial transaction for specific products or services. From a buyer's point of view it expresses the intention to buy and is called a [[purchase order]]. From a seller's point of view it expresses the intention to sell and is referred to as a [[Sales Order|sales order]]. When the purchase order of the buyer and the sales order of the seller agree, the orders become a [[contract]] between the buyer and seller.

Within an organization, the term order may be used to refer to a [[work order]] for manufacturing, a [[preventive maintenance]] order, or an order to make repairs to a facility.

In many businesses, orders are used to collect and report [[cost]]s and [[revenue]]s according to well-defined purposes. Then it is possible to show for what purposes costs have been incurred.

==Spoken orders==
Businesses such as [[retail store]]s, [[restaurant]]s and [[filling station]]s conduct business with their customers by accepting orders that are spoken or implied by the buyer's actions. Taking a shopping cart of merchandise to a check-out counter is an implied intent to buy the merchandise. Placing a [[take-out]] or eat-in order at a restaurant is a spoken purchase order. Putting gasoline in one's tank at a filling station is an implied order. The seller usually expects immediate payment by cash, check or credit card for these purchases, and the seller provides the buyer with a receipt for the payment. In legal terms, this form of business order is an "[[implied in fact contract]]".

==Steps in commercial orders==
In commerce, various business documents are used to record the negotiation of an agreement to buy and sell, record the agreement itself, and record compliance with the agreement and closure of the contract. An agreement to buy and sell is a form of contract.

There are five basic requirements for a contract to exist between two parties: agreement, voluntary, consideration, capacity, and legality. A sixth requirement of "in writing" sometimes applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mallor |first=Jane P. |author2=A. James Barnes |author3=Thomas Bowers |author4=Michael J. Phillips |author5=Arlen W. Langvardt  |title=Business Law and the Regulatory Environment: Concepts and Cases |publisher=Irwin/McGraw-Hill |year=1998 |pages=175 |isbn=0-256-19716-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main concern for commercial orders is that there must be '''agreement''' (offer and acceptance) for the order to be a contract. Prior to this, businesses often record the details of negotiations by using a [[request for quotation]], request for bid, sales quotation, or sales bid. Quotations are non-binding and part of the negotiation process. A request for bid can be binding or non-binding, depending on the terms of the bid.{{citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Once an agreement or contract is in place, businesses record these as confirmed purchase orders and confirmed sales orders.{{citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Uniform Commercial Code==
In the US, Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] covers commercial contracts, and section 2-103 gives definitions of terms under this code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/ Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2-106 describes the difference between a '''present sale''' (recorded as a sales order) and a '''sale''' (recorded as a transfer of title to the buyer).

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) In this Article unless the context otherwise requires "[[contract]]" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods.  "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time.  A "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2-401).  A "present sale" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aggregate level of orders==
In their "Advance Monthly Sales for Retail Trade and Food Services", the US Census Bureau publishes estimates of US retail and food services sales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/svsd/www/retail.html Advance Monthly Sales For Retail And Food Services: Latest Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These "sales" are orders that have been filled; payment has been made or is an account receivable.
In their "Preliminary Report on Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories and Orders", the US Census Bureau publishes statistics for "new orders", shipments, "unfilled orders" and inventories for manufactured durable goods. This gives an indication whether trade is increasing or decreasing for manufactured durable goods in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/indicator/www/m3/index.htm Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, &amp; Orders (M3)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7187">In financial markets '''payment for order flow''' refers to the compensation that a [[Stockbroker|broker]] receives, not from its client, but from a third party that wants to influence how the broker routes client orders.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/answers/payordf.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, [[market maker]]s such as [[Broker-dealer|dealers]] and [[securities exchange]]s are willing to pay a broker for the right to transact with that broker's clients because they believe those clients will be uninformed traders—retail or other investors who are trading because of emotion or the need to raise cash and not because they know an asset is misvalued.&lt;ref&gt;Div. of Mkt. Reg., SEC, [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/market2000.pdf Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments], 22 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

By purchasing what it expects to be uninformed order flow, a market-maker can buy at the [[bid price|bid]] and sell at the [[ask price|ask]] with less risk of trading at a loss than with an informed trader who knows that the market is mispricing the security.&lt;ref name="TnEHarris"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Larry |title=Trading and Exchanges: Market Microstructure for Practitioners |publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2003 |pages=155, 518–519 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd9hDRR1Yx4C&amp;q=Madoff#search_anchor |isbn=0195144708 |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, market-makers who pay for order flow can capture the [[bid-offer spread|spread]] while reducing the risk that the spread is too narrow to adequately compensate them for the risk of loss.

==History==
Payment for order flow was a practice pioneered by [[Bernard Madoff]], and the practice has long been controversial.&lt;ref name="FTFarrell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grasso"&gt;{{cite news | last =Frank | first =Allan Dodd | title =Former NYSE Chairman Grasso Speaks, Part II | work =The [[Daily Beast]] | pages = |publisher = | date =March 31, 2009 | url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-03-31/former-nyse-chairman-grasso-speaks-part-ii/full/ | accessdate =April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAlpha"&gt;{{cite web | last =Pellecchia | first =Ray | title ='Payment for Order Flow': Madoff's Earlier Days
 | work =Seeking Alpha| publisher = | date =December 30, 2008 | url =http://seekingalpha.com/article/112537-payment-for-order-flow-madoff-s-earlier-days | accessdate =April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on February 27, 2009, after years of opposing payment for order flow, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] sought permission from the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) to allow payment for order flow on its electronic exchange(s).&lt;ref name="NyseSEC"&gt;{{cite web | last =NYSE Alternext US, LLC | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Proposed Rule Change Amending Schedule of Fees and Charges for Exchange  Services | work =www.sec.gov | publisher =U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission | date =February 27, 2009 | url =https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysealtr/2009/34-59478.pdf| format =PDF | doi = | accessdate =April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NYSE is proposing to pay for [[limit order]]s in order to put more cash into the market. This contrasts with the traditional model of payment for order flow that pays only for [[market order]]s.  
Payment for order flow has become less lucrative on a per share basis because of the decline in the [[tick size]] and the bid/ask spread. When stocks traded on 1/8ths of a dollar, payments for order flow were much larger than they became after 2001 when the tick size in U.S. markets fell to one cent.&lt;ref name="TnEHarris" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FTFarrell"&gt;{{cite news 
  | last =Farrell  | first =Greg  | title =SEC inaction that helped fuel scheme  | work =[[Financial Times]]
  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =December 23, 2008 
  | url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c510411e-d12e-11dd-8cc3-000077b07658.html  | accessdate =April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Harris reports that in 1997, 24% of [[E-Trade]]'s transaction revenue came from payment for order flow, but that by the second quarter of 2001 such payments accounted for only 15% of transaction revenue.&lt;ref name="TnEHarris" /&gt;

==Analysis==
The benign view is that in competitive markets, the payments that brokers receive for selling uninformed order flow reduce commissions for retail investors so that the retail investors are no worse off.&lt;ref name="TnEHarris" /&gt; Payment for order flow may also allow smaller [[trading venue]]s to compete more effectively with the NYSE.&lt;ref name="Joel Seligman 2002"&gt;Joel Seligman, "Rethinking Securities Markets", 57 ''Bus. Law''. 665 (2001-2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

A more negative view is that exchanges and other market-makers who pay for order flow reduce [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] on exchanges that do not pay for order flow and thus increase the bid–ask spread. This means that traders whose orders do not receive payment bear the cost to their detriment.&lt;ref name="CNNfn"&gt;{{cite web | last =McMillan | first =Alex Frew|title =Q&amp;A: Madoff talks trading, The founder of one of Wall Street's big market makers goes one-on-one | work =CNNMoney| date =May 29, 2000 | url =http://money.cnn.com/2000/05/29/investing/q_madoff/ | accessdate =April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes122008"&gt;{{cite news | last =Henriques | first =Diana B. |  title =Madoff Scheme Kept Rippling Outward, Across Borders| work =[[New York Times]] | date =December 19, 2008 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/20/business/20madoff.html?pagewanted=2 | accessdate =April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joel Seligman]] has noted that "Few practices are more likely to subvert quote competition" than payment for order flow.&lt;ref name="Joel Seligman 2002"/&gt; [[John C. Coffee]] has described it as a "bribe".&lt;ref&gt;John C. Coffee, "Brokers and Bribery", ''N.Y.L.J.'' Sept. 27, 1990 at 5&lt;/ref&gt;  He notes, however, that the SEC permits the practice because it sustained competitors to the NYSE and reduces the likelihood that NYSE specialists will obtain monopoly power.&lt;ref&gt;John. C. Coffee and Hillary A. Sale, ''Securities Regulation'', p. 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
In the United States, accepting payment for order flow is only allowed if no other trading venue is quoting a better price on the [[National Market System]]. Moreover, the broker must inform its client in writing that it accepts payment for order flow:
* Upon the opening of the [[brokerage account]]
* On an ongoing annual basis
* On trade confirmations&lt;ref name="SECpfof"&gt;{{cite web
  | last =  | first = | title =Payment for Order Flow  | work =www.sec.gov
  | publisher =[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] 
  | url =https://www.sec.gov/answers/payordf.htm  | doi =  | accessdate =April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The notification on trade confirmations may read as follows "[Brokerage] receives remuneration for directing orders to particular broker/dealers or market centers for execution. Such remuneration is considered compensation to the firm and the source and amount of any compensation received by the firm in connection with your transaction will be disclosed upon request."&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike an [[initiative]] or legislative referendum that allows voters to suggest new legislation, a popular referendum allows them to suggest repealing existing legislation.&lt;ref name=ncsl/&gt;&lt;ref name=nne3/&gt;

As with an initiative, a popular referendum is held after a given number of signatures supporting it have been submitted to the authorities; in some cases such a referendum may also be initiated by regional authorities.&lt;ref name=ms2/&gt;&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; Depending on local legislation, the popular referendum may be implemented only in a short window of time after the legislation has been passed; in others it may be used to defeat any existing legislation.&lt;ref name=ms2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ace&gt;[http://aceproject.org/ace-en/focus/direct-democracy/referendums Referendums], ACE Encyclopedia, Electoral Knowledge Network&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Butler, Austin Ranney, ''Referendums around the world: the growing use of direct democracy'', American Enterprise Institute, 1994, {{ISBN|0-8447-3853-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GXV-HFnk_9wC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22abrogative+referendum%22++-wiki+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JDMgfmbcnT&amp;sig=orhRXI6TPjl9DPP717w00PSn1Kc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ea1US-a9HsKYlAfN0I2UBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22abrogative%20referendum%22%20%20-wiki%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false Google Print, p.63]&lt;/ref&gt; Specific details on the applicable procedure (such as the number of signatures, whether there is a time limit and its duration on when the popular referendum may be passed, and the body to which they must be submitted) vary from country to country (and in the [[United States]], from state to state).

Supporters of the popular referendum point out that it is a safeguard against special interests taking over, and protects the rights of minorities.&lt;ref name=ms/&gt;&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; Critics point out that [[direct democracy]] votes are dominated by people who have strong feelings about the issue at hand, and as such, it empowers special interests.&lt;ref name=sun/&gt;&lt;ref name=ace/&gt;

The '''Priestley 11''' are eleven [[legal education|law subjects]] required to be successfully completed for candidate status for admission into practice as a [[lawyer|legal practitioner]] in [[Australia]]. They are named after the Law Admissions Consultative Committee (LACC, commonly known as the Priestley Committee as it was chaired by Lancelot John Priestley) which in 1992 determined the minimum academic study requirements for legal practice.  The Priestley 11 list is set out in LACC, Uniform Admission Rules 2015, Schedule 1.  A law degree or diploma will be recognised as a qualification for admission to practice only if every student has to study all of these subjects.  However, the subjects do not have to be taught separately:  it is sufficient if they are covered within the syllabus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20374">The passage of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] in 1982 allowed for the provision of challenging the constitutionality of laws governing '''prostitution law in Canada''' in addition to interpretative case law. Other legal proceedings have dealt with [[ultra vires]] issues (whether a jurisdiction, such as a Provincial Government or municipality, has the powers to legislate on the matter). In 2013, three provisions of the current law were overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada, with a twelve-month stay of effect. In June 2014, the Government introduced amending legislation in response.

== Constitutional law ==

=== 20th century ===

==== Sections 193, 195 (213) ====

The new formulations of section 213 found themselves under challenge in the lower courts within a year, with conflicting results 
({{cite court |litigants= R. v. McLean|vol=28 |reporter= C.C.C. (3d) |opinion=176 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1986 |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}; {{cite court |litigants=R. v. Bear |vol=54  |reporter=C.R. (3d) |opinion= 68|pinpoint= |court= |date=1986 |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}).

[[Nova Scotia]]'s Appeal Court ruled the legislation violated the guarantee of freedom of expression in the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], by constraining communication in relation to legal activity (R. v. Skinner (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 203). The [[Alberta Court of Appeal]] disagreed, holding that infringement of freedom of expression was a justifiable limitation as no “clear and convincing” alternative was available for dealing with the nuisance of street prostitution (R. v. Jahelka (1987), 79 A.R. 44).

The [[Manitoba Court of Appeal]] upheld section 195.1(1)(c) on the grounds that there was no [[prima facie]] case of freedom of expression (Reference Re Sections 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, [1987] 6 W.W.R. 289).

When referred to the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]], it upheld the sections (Reference Re Sections 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123])Chief [[Brian Dickson|Justice Dickson]] for the majority (Madam [[Bertha Wilson|Justice Wilson]] and Madam [[Claire L'Heureux-Dubé|Justice L'Heureux‑Dubé]] dissenting), agreed that freedom of expression was restricted by what was now 213(1)(c) it did not infringe or deny the freedom of association guaranteed by section 2(d) of the Charter. He also held that it did not infringe the right to be treated fairly when life, liberty and security are affected by governmental action, as guaranteed by section 7 of the Charter. The reference to the court also included the bawdy house provisions which were held to not infringe the guarantee of freedom of expression provided for by section 2(b) of the Charter. Finally the impugned infringement of the freedom of expression guaranteed by section 2(b) of the Charter was justifiable under section 1 of the Charter as being a reasonable limit on a protected right.

The justification was set out in three stages:
# The court must first characterize the objective of the law (a remedy for solicitation in public places and the eradication of social nuisance from the public display of the sale of sex). This was constructed as restricted to taking prostitution off the streets and out of public view. In this respect, Dickson disagreed with the opinion of another justice that the legislative objective addressed the broader questions of the exploitation, degradation and subordination of women.
# The court must assess the proportionality of the legislation to the objectives; in particular any infringement of rights must be the minimum to achieve this. It was held the provisions were not unduly intrusive.
# The court must determine if the effects of the law so infringe a protected right that it outweighs the objective. It was held that the curtailment of street solicitation was in keeping with the interests of society, for its nuisance‑related aspects.

==== Section 198 ====
A part of section 198(1)(d) was challenged in 1991, namely that a previous conviction of keeping a disorderly house amounts to proof of the nature of the premises in subsequent proceedings. This was held to contravene sections 11(d) and 7 of the Charter (R. v. Janoff (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 454 (Que. C.A.)), and became inoperative.

==== Ontario constitutional challenge 2007 ====
{{Main article|Bedford v. Canada}}
A legal challenge to three of Canada's many prostitution laws was filed in [[Ontario Superior Court]] in March 2007.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/194455 |title=Charter Challenge on Prostitution Filed Toronto Star March 21, 2007 |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a decision handed down by Madam Justice [[Susan Himel]] in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on September 28, 2010, the prostitution laws were declared invalid.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2010/2010onsc4264/2010onsc4264.html |title=Bedford v.

Two of the five judges dissented from the last ruling, stating that the law on solicitation was not justifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prostitution law: Ontario's top court allows brothels, but soliciting ruled illegal |author=Jayme Poisson |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/1151925--prostitution-law-ontario-s-top-court-allows-brothels-but-soliciting-ruled-illegal |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oca&gt;[http://www.ontariocourts.ca/decisions/2012/2012ONCA0186.pdf Canada v.

==== British Columbia constitutional challenge 2007 ====
A related challenge was mounted in British Columbia in 2007
&lt;ref&gt;[http://raincoaster.com/2007/08/04/charter-challenge-launched-to-strike-down-prostitution-laws/ Press Release: Charter Challenge Launched to Strike Down Prostitution Laws. August 4 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
, but did not proceed due to a procedural motion by the [[Attorney General of Canada]] seeking dismissal on the grounds of lack of [[Standing (law)|standing]] by the litigants. This was upheld by the [[British Columbia Supreme Court|BC Supreme Court]] in 2008, 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/SC/08/17/2008BCSC1726.htm Downtown Eastside Sex Workers United Against Violence Society v. Attorney General (Canada), 2008 BCSC 1726 Dec 15 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

but successfully appealed in October 2010. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/british-columbia/bc-challenge-to-prostitution-laws-to-proceed/article1753641/ |title=B.C. court gives green light to prostitution laws challenge |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Attorney General then appealed this decision of the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] who released their decision on September 21, 2012. They dismissed the appeal enabling the case to once again proceed in the court of first instance.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc.lexum.org/en/2012/2012scc45/2012scc45.html Canada (Attorney General) v. Downtown Eastside Sex Workers United Against Violence Society, 2012 SCC 45 Sept 21 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925021343/http://scc.lexum.org/en/2012/2012scc45/2012scc45.html |date=2012-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court made a number of observations regarding the issues involved:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"In this case, all three factors, applied purposively and flexibly, favour granting public interest standing to the respondents. In fact, there is no dispute that the first and second factors are met: the respondents’ action raises serious justiciable issues and the respondents have an interest in the outcome of the action and are fully engaged with the issues that they seek to raise. Indeed, the constitutionality of the prostitution provisions of the Criminal Code constitutes a serious justiciable issue and the respondents, given their work, have a strong engagement with the issue...

''This case constitutes public interest litigation: the respondents have raised issues of public importance that transcend their immediate interests. Their challenge is comprehensive, relating as it does to nearly the entire legislative scheme. It provides an opportunity to assess through the constitutional lens the overall effect of this scheme on those most directly affected by it...
''''
It is obvious that the claim is being pursued with thoroughness and skill...''

''The impugned Criminal Code provisions, by criminalizing many of the activities surrounding prostitution, adversely affect a great number of women. These issues are also clearly justiciable ones, as they concern the constitutionality of the challenged provisions...
''
''Some aspects of the statement of claim raise serious issues as to the invalidity of the legislation...''

''Granting standing will not only serve to enhance the principle of legality with respect to serious issues of direct concern to some of the most marginalized members of society, but it will also promote the economical use of scarce judicial resources"''''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In view of the subsequent decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, this application became moot.

==== Supreme Court decision 2013 ====
In a decision dated 20 December 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the laws in question, ruling that a ban on solicitation and brothels violated prostitutes' rights to safety. They delayed the enforcement of their decision for one year—also applicable to the Ontario sections—to give the government a chance to write new laws. Following the announcement of the decision Valerie Scott, one of the applicants, stated in the media that, regardless of the decision, sex workers must be involved in the process of constructing the new legislation: "The thing here is politicians, though they may know us as clients, they do not understand how sex work works. They won't be able to write a half-decent law. It will fail. That's why you must bring sex workers to the table in a meaningful way."&lt;ref name="Cbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court strikes down Canada's prostitution laws|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/supreme-court-strikes-down-canada-s-prostitution-laws-1.2471572?cmp=rss|accessdate=21 December 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CITATION: Canada (Attorney General) v.

== Case law ==

=== Section 197: Bawdy house definition ===
The wording of section 197 allows of some interpretation. As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Cohen [1939] "Prior to 1907, a common bawdy house was defined by section 225 of the Code as “a house, room, set of rooms or place of any kind kept for purposes of prostitution,” but in that year, by 6-7 Edward VII, chapter 8, section 2, the section was repealed and a new one enacted in the same terms but with the addition at the end, of the words “or occupied or resorted to by one or more persons for such purposes.” That case reversed an Ontario Court of Appeal decision acquitting a woman convicted of offering sexual services on her own. The court pointed to the words ''one or more persons'' as clearly indicating that operating on one's own constituted a bawdy house.  
&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc.lexum.org/en/1938/1939scr0-212/1939scr0-212.html Supreme Court of Canada. The King v. Cohen, &amp;#91;1939&amp;#93; S.C.R. 212] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415064830/http://scc.lexum.org/en/1938/1939scr0-212/1939scr0-212.html |date=2013-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another requisite is that a place must be resorted to for prostitution on a habitual and regular basis (R. v. Patterson  (1968), 67 D.L.R. (2d) 82 (S.C.C.)). A woman who used her own apartment, alone, but regularly was convicted (R. v. Worthington (1972), 22 C.R.N.S. 34 (Ont. C.A.)).

Another relates to the alternative definition of "the practice of acts of indecency", since this leaves open the definition of [[indecency]], which may not be universally understood or accepted. One definition of [[community standards]] comes from the Supreme Court decision in [[R. v. Tremblay]],  [1993] 2 S.C.R. 932. In considering [[nude dancing]] the majority held that the acts were not indecent since they did not fall below the community standard of tolerance, citing the circumstances surrounding the act, the degree of harm that could result from public exposure, and expert evidence.  No complaints had been received; the acts were in a closed room between consenting adults without physical contact, while expert witnesses suggested this was [[voyeurism]] and [[exhibitionism]] that caused no harm.

When ''Tremblay'' was used in Ontario to determine that [[Lap dance|lap dancing]] or [[table dancing]] was not indecent Toronto passed a by-law prohibiting close-contact dancing. However the Court of Appeal  reversed the decision on the grounds that this constituted prostitution (R. v. Mara, 27 O.R. (3d) 643).  Furthermore, the court ruled that Parliament intended to abolish prostitution as a form of violence against women, and thus the dancing exceeded public acceptability. The Supreme Court confirmed this in June 1997 holding that sexual contact constitutes prostitution and exceeds community standards.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''This type of activity is harmful to society in many ways.  It degrades and dehumanizes women; it desensitizes sexuality and is incompatible with the dignity and equality of each human being''.  Mr. Justice Sopinka, 26 June 1997 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Section 210: Bawdy house Bawdy house keeping ===
Participation alone is insufficient under 210 (1), without “some degree of control over the care and management of the premises” (R. v. Corbeil, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 83).
&lt;ref name="justice03"/&gt;

=== Section 212: Procuring ===
Subsection 3 provides a presumption of offence of living on the avails, if associated with a sex worker or premise. A [[reverse onus]] such as this contravenes the presumption of evidence under section 11(d) of the Charter and was challenged. The Supreme Court found this justifiable in Downey v. R.( [1992] 2 S.C.R. 10). The majority accepted that an accused might be convicted despite the existence of [[reasonable doubt]], for instance, a person may share accommodation with someone without necessarily living on their earnings. The Court found this a reasonable limit on the presumption of innocence because the intent was to prevent exploitation by pimps and that there was no real danger of innocent persons being found guilty if they provided evidence to the contrary, thereby constituting reasonable doubt. It was felt that this provision protected sex workers from abuse.

The '''Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act''' (officially titled '''Bill C-30''', originally titled '''Lawful Access Act''') was a proposed amendment to the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] introduced by the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government of [[Stephen Harper]] on February 14, 2012, during the [[41st Canadian Parliament]].

The bill would have granted authorities new powers to monitor and track the digital activities of Canadians in real-time, required service providers to log information about their customers and turn it over if requested, and made [[backdoor (computing)|back door]] entrances mandatory allowing remote access of individuals' electronic information, each without needing a [[warrant (law)|warrant]]&lt;ref name="bracelet"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/14/online-surveillance-bill-will-put-electronic-prisoners-bracelet-on-every-canadian/ |title=Online surveillance bill ‘will put an electronic prisoner’s bracelet on every Canadian’ |work=National Post |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Failed verification|date=April 2013}} Documents obtained under the ''[[Access to Information Act]]'' show that the government desired to use the expanded powers in cases not involving criminality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theprovince.com/news/Tories+stand+firm+lawful+access+legislation/6146676/story.html |title=Tories stand firm on 'online spying' legislation |publisher=Theprovince.com |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2012-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219174612/http://www.theprovince.com/news/Tories+stand+firm+lawful+access+legislation/6146676/story.html |archivedate=February 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Rehearsal and Performance of Lawful Access|url = https://curve.carleton.ca/4c458bdb-33fb-42b1-bf6b-a390e973c792|website = curve.carleton.ca|date = 2015-01-01|access-date = 2016-01-16|first = Tomblin,|last = Jordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill did not mention children, or internet predators, other than in its title;&lt;ref name="change" /&gt; critics claimed the "feel-good name" was unrelated to the content of the bill, and chosen simply to "sell legislation to the public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheadle |first=Bruce |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/business/motherhood-titles-for-government-bills-used-to-sell-legislation-to-public-139473103.html |title=Motherhood titles for government bills used to sell legislation to public |publisher=Winnipeg Free Press |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claimed that authorities would likely use the powers to harass peaceful protestors and activists.&lt;ref&gt;First Perspective, [http://www.firstperspective.ca/news/562-human-rights-lawyer-warns-feds-internet-surveillance-bill-could-lead-to-massive-internet-sweep Human rights lawyer warns feds’ internet surveillance bill could lead to massive internet sweep]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/02/22/chris-selley-we-wont-let-c-30-limit-our-freedoms-without-a-fight/ |title=Chris Selley: We won’t let C-30 limit our freedoms without a fight &amp;#124; Full Comment &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=Fullcomment.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole |first=Yolande |url=https://www.straight.com/article-615111/vancouver/demonstrators-protest-against-conservative-bills-outside-richmond-casino |title=Demonstrators protest against Vic Toews and Conservative bills outside Richmond casino &amp;#124; Vancouver, Canada |publisher=Straight.com |date=2012-02-22 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was widely opposed within Canada, particularly after Public Safety Minister [[Vic Toews]] told an opposition MP that he could "either stand with us or with the child pornographers" during a debate. The government ultimately withdrew the bill in 2013, citing that opposition. Similar legislation had been unsuccessfully proposed in the past, by both the Liberal and Conservative parties in Canada, and mirrored legislation introduced in other countries. This bill, however, was re-introduced under the name Bill C-13 (short titled [[Bill C-13|Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act]]) by Stephen Harper's Conservative government on November 20, 2013 and it passed through all legislative stages to receive royal assent on December 9, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = LEGISinfo - House Government Bill C-13 (41-2)|url = http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?billId=6301394&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1|website = www.parl.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of bill ==
There had been multiple attempts to introduce "lawful access" legislation, allowing police to avoid the necessity of a warrant to obtain information, since 1999 when the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] first proposed it. However none of them have been successfully passed.&lt;ref name="change"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/02/15/pol-online-surveillance-amendments.html|title=Online surveillance bill could change, Harper signals|date=15 February 2012|publisher=CBC.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="every" /&gt; Bill C-30 largely mirrored the unsuccessful attempts by the Conservatives to table C-50, C-51 and C-52 that were abandoned upon the dissolution of Parliament for the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]].&lt;ref name="every"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6316/125/|title=Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Lawful Access, But Were (Understandably) Afraid To Ask|date=13 February 2013|publisher=Michaelgeist.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; NDP MPs [[Anne Minh-Thu Quach]] and [[Carol Hughes (politician)|Carol Hughes]] have criticised the Liberal party given their previous support for near-identical legislation in the past.&lt;ref name="hansard289"&gt;{{cite web|author=Anne Minh-Thu Quach |url=https://openparliament.ca/hansards/2454/289/ |title=Business of Supply |publisher=openparliament.ca |date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hansard95"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/hansards/2454/95/ |author=Carol Hughes |title=Business of Supply |publisher=openparliament.ca |date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association]] and ''Canadian Lawyer'' magazine have suggested that such proposals may violate the [[Constitution of Canada]], and be challenged before the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] as [[unreasonable search and seizure]] of digital information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bccla.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/201202-Report-BCCLA-Moving-Toward-a-Surveillance-Society.pdf |title=Moving toward a surveillance society |publisher=British Columbia Civil Liberties Association |date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Toews' predecessor [[Stockwell Day]] stated that "we have not and we will not be proposing legislation to grant police the powers to get information from internet providers without a warrant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/searchengine_20070920_3369.mp3 |title=CBC Podcast |publisher=CBC.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toews has dismissed the comment, and noted that the requirement for court oversight of police was "an additional burden on the criminal justice system."&lt;ref name="every" /&gt;

On February 14, 2012 Toews formally tabled the "Bill C-30: Lawful Access Act", but withdrew the bill an hour later and resubmit it with a "last minute change",&lt;ref name="nationalpostvic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/15/protecting-children-from-internet-predators-act-vic-toews/ |title=Vic Toews will 'entertain amendments' to Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=News.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the title "Bill C-30: Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act" instead.&lt;ref name="nationalpostvic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt |first=Sarah |url=http://blogs.canada.com/2012/02/15/can-you-spot-the-difference-on-lawful-access-bill/ |title=Can you spot the difference on "lawful access" bill? &amp;#124; Canada.com |publisher=Blogs.canada.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content of bill ==

{{rquote|right|If the police have a legitimate reason to snoop into my banking, email or web-browsing records, a judge would clearly allow for that lawful search to happen.

The bill would have allowed authorities to demand access to subscriber information from both [[ISP]]s and telephone providers without needing to present a warrant - and would have required telecommunications providers to ensure that there was a [[backdoor (computing)|back door]] entrance to allow all communications to be intercepted when desired.&lt;ref name="online" /&gt;

The bill would not only have granted these powers to police agencies, but also to the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] and [[Competition Bureau]] officials, as well as anybody "appointed" by the Minister of Public Safety to carry out such actions.&lt;ref name="online" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ctv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20120219/ctv-question-period-toews-twitter-c-30-fallout-120219/ |title=Ottawa's ISP spying law heading to committee &amp;#124; CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would also have allowed any of these persons to make copies of the data taken from citizens' digital devices, without oversight or a right of appeal.&lt;ref name="ctv" /&gt;

The bill would have prohibited ISPs from answering affirmatively if a customer asked them whether authorities had been searching their data.&lt;ref&gt;David T.S. Fraser,, [http://blog.privacylawyer.ca/2012/02/hidden-gag-order-in-bill-c-30-aka.html The hidden gag order in Bill C-30 (aka the lawful access bill)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalnews.ca/gag+order/6442584281/story.html |title=Global News &amp;#124; 'Gag order' in Internet snooping bill prevents Canadians from knowing whether personal information is handed to authorities |publisher=Globalnews.ca |date=2012-02-19 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill would have increased the number of actions that can be legally carried out by police officers without a warrant. In the current Criminal Code, section 487.11 allows a police officer to "exercise any of the powers described in subsection 487(1) or 492.1(1) without a warrant". In Bill C-30, the section was amended to include "exercise any of the powers described in section 487, 492.1 or 492.2 without a warrant".&lt;ref name="billc30" /&gt;

Section 487 of the Criminal Code was left unchanged by Bill C-30; ts subsection 487(2.1) allows a police officer to search a building and "use any computer system at the building or place to search any data contained in or available to the computer system", among other things. Section 492.1 was to be slightly amended by Bill C-30 to allow a police officer to obtain location tracking data by means of a tracking device and "install, activate, use, maintain, monitor and remove the tracking device, including covertly". Section 492.2 was also to be amended by Bill C-30 to allow a police officer to obtain transmission data by means of a transmission data recorder and "install, activate, use, maintain, monitor and remove the transmission data recorder, including covertly".&lt;ref name="billc30"&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=5380965&amp;file=4 C-30] [https://www.webcitation.org/65gNy1bUN?url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=5380965&amp;file=4 Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/FullText.html Criminal Code] [https://www.webcitation.org/65gOC3Xmv?url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/FullText.html Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bill C-30, tracking data was defined as "data that relates to the location of a transaction, individual or thing". Transmission data has a more complicated definition, but essentially refers to meta-data that is attached to a message/communication in order to aid in its transmission to its intended destination, such as IP address, phone number, time, duration, size.&lt;ref name="billc30" /&gt;

Section 64 of the bill was a final "catch-all" that says that if the government decided it overlooked any additional abilities it believed it needed to fulfill "generally, for carrying out the purposes and provisions of this act", it could have retroactively add those abilities to the law.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1" /&gt;

A coalition of citizens and civil liberties organizations formed the StopSpying.ca coalition in June 2011 to speak out against lawful access. The coalition was led by OpenMedia.ca and considered responsible for leading the public outcry against bill c-30. 
Without commenting on the morality of the bill, the [[Canadian Network Operators Consortium]] noted that smaller, independent ISPs would likely be unable to afford expensive new equipment to allow authorities real-time monitoring of their customers and may have to discontinue business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itworldcanada.com/news/surveillance-law-could-close-small-isps-lawyer/144316 |title=Surveillance law could close small ISPs: Lawyer - Page 1 - Voice, Data, and IP |publisher=Itworldcanada.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry had estimated that the initial cost of the bill to be $80 Million over four years, and $6.7 Million dollars each year after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Feb 22, 2012 1:11 PM ET |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/02/22/pol-lawful-access-costs.html |title=Online surveillance bill setup costs estimated at $80M - Politics - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2012-02-22 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISPs claimed the cost could be much higher.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Steven Chase |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-hits-pause-on-web-surveillance-act/article2349818/ |title=Ottawa hits pause on Web surveillance act |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CBC, the costs would have either translated as higher telecommunications costs for Canadian consumers, or increased federal taxes to pay for the program.&lt;ref name="howshouldpay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2012/02/how-should-canadians-pay-for-the-online-surveillance-bill.html |title=How should Canadians pay for the online surveillance bill? |publisher=CBC.ca |date=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]] leader [[Elizabeth May]] dubbed the title [[propaganda]], noting that "other than the fact it’s for propaganda purposes, there’s no reason to call it about Internet predators", suggesting that the Conservatives were trying to use the rhetorical ploy of [[Children's interests (rhetoric)|appealing to the sake of children]] to garner support.&lt;ref name="oakbaynews1" /&gt; [[The Province]] suggested a more accurate name might be the "Spying on Every Single Canadian any Time We Feel Like it Act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark |first=Gordon |url=https://theprovince.com/news/believe+spacemen+less+sure+about+space+cadets/6179237/story.html |title=I believe in spacemen, but I'm less sure about space cadets |publisher=Theprovince.com |date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition had focused on the provisions that would allow law enforcement agencies and government-appointed inspectors to access identifying information from ISPs on demand, without a warrant. Documents leaked online showed the [[Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police]] asking members to find examples of cases that would have profited from lawful access,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2012/01/18/police-scrambling-to-justify-lawful-access-laws/ |title=Police ‘scrambling’ to justify lawful access laws &amp;#124; FP Tech Desk &amp;#124; Financial Post |publisher=Business.financialpost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no cases had been found, leading critics to charge that police were already able to prosecute predators successfully in Canada with existing legislation.&lt;ref name="every" /&gt;

The international advocacy group [[Reporters Without Borders]] opined the bill went too far, and failed to account for "respect for people’s private lives and the presumption of innocence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/canada/2012/02/21/bill_c30/ |title=Online surveillance bill threatens web users' rights |publisher=IFEX |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal deputy privacy commissioner Chantal Bernier argued the proposed powers are too broad: "As the legislation is written now, it could impact any law-abiding Canadian citizen."&lt;ref name="BigBrother" /&gt;

== Similar legislation in other countries ==

Government officials claimed that similar legislation has been introduced in several other countries already, including the United States, Great Britain and Australia.&lt;ref name="GlobeBacklash"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chase |first=Steven |last2=Curry |first2=Bill |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/facing-a-backlash-ottawa-moves-to-retool-cybercrime-bill/article2339856/ |title=Facing a backlash, Ottawa moves to retool cybercrime bill |work=The Globe and Mail |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics have said that other countries should serve as a warning to Canada, noting the many errors and broad overreach of their legislation, with police requesting the private information for mundane tasks such as determining [[school district]] eligibility.&lt;ref name="every" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christopher-parsons.com/blog/technology/announcement-lawful-access-report-now-available/ |title=Announcement: Lawful Access Report Now Available &amp;#124; Technology, Thoughts, and Trinkets |publisher=Christopher-parsons.com |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar legislation has been drafted in the Philippines despite being met with up to eight petitions filed with the highest court in the Philippines questioning the constitutionality of the legislation. The Filipino legislation is intended, like the Canadian bill, to prevent cybersex, online child pornography, identity theft, and spamming. However, in addition to these crimes, the Filipino bill also makes libel a cybercrime punishable by up to twelve years. It is generally this last issue that has privacy and right’s groups concerned over the legislation. “It violates Filipinos' rights to free expression and it is wholly incompatible with the Philippine government's obligations under international law,” said Brad Adams, Asia director of US-based Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19810474|title=Philippine cybercrime law takes effect amid protests|publisher=BBC News|date=2012-10-03|accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 allows telecommunications companies to retain customer traffic data for longer if a customer is suspected in a cybercrime, unlike the proposed Canadian legislation however, this information cannot be handed over to police without a warrant. Like the Canadian bill, the Australian version was met with heavy criticism and a report from the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety of Australia took issue with four main flaws in the Australian legislation and made 13 recommendations, which Attorney-General Robert McClelland said the government will “consider”. 
	The first flaw of the bill according to the Joint Select Committee is that the bill “fails to distinguish between the retention of traffic metadata, such as the time and destination of an online communication, and the contents of that communication.” The second flaw of the bill is that “there is a possibility foreign governments could be given access to data in relation to crimes that in Australia would not be serious enough to warrant an interception, like political crimes”. Thirdly there is a possibility that foreign governments would not assist the investigation into some cases of child exploitation because they are not treated as seriously in some countries. "Many countries, including many European countries, impose a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment for the possession, dissemination, sale or rent of [[child sexual abuse material]]," the report said, which would not trigger the penalty threshold for a "serious" crime. The final flaw the Joint Select Committee found with the bill is “the potential for data on Australians to be shared with countries "at large", rather than limited to those that have also acceded to the Council of Europe convention or have an existing formal mutual assistance arrangement with Australia.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.com.au/article/397865/inquiry_picks_holes_government_cybercrime_bill/|title=Inquiry picks holes in government Cybercrime Bill|author=Stilgherrian|publisher=CSO Online|date=2011-08-19|accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] highlighted the fact that the warrantless British system has resulted in police making an average of more than 1,700 queries daily, for personal information about citizens from their telecommunications providers.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Danny|last= O&amp;#039;Brien |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/08/uks-half-million-intercepts |title=The UK's Surveillance Society: Half A Million Intercepts of Communications Data in 2008 &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the FISA act (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) along with the amendments made to it in 2008 can be considered a similar bill to that of the Canadian bill C-30. The FISA protects telecommunications companies complicit in providing user information to federal law enforcement authorities. In addition to this the 2008 amendments, which were extended another five years at the end of 2012, allow the NSA (National Security Agency) to conduct electronic surveillance on any US citizen suspected of conversing with any person outside of the USA suspected by the US government of terrorist activities. No warrant is needed for the execution of surveillance over American citizens, which is the central issue privacy and rights’ activists have had with this legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/usa/scotus-FISA-FAA-surveillance-483/|title=US Supreme Court refuses to let Americans challenge FISA eavesdropping law|publisher=Rt.com|date=2013-02-26|accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minister of Public Safety (Canada)|Public safety minister]] [[Vic Toews]], who introduced the bill, had become a lightning rod for criticism after suggesting people had to choose to "either stand with us or with the child pornographers",&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/02/13/technology-lawful-access-toews-pornographers.html |title=Online surveillance critics accused of supporting child porn |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a remark that was said to be "so far out whack with the standards of polite discourse that it kind of scared [supporters] off".&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1" /&gt; NDP MP [[Jasbir Sandhu]] commented that "We are often warned that rights and freedoms are not permanent, that we only keep them if we stand up and fight for them. However, when [we] stand up and fight to protect these rights[...], we are accused of being sympathetic to child pornographers".&lt;ref name="hansard35"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/hansards/2454/35/ |author=Jasbir Sandhu |title=Business of Supply |publisher=openparliament.ca |date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toews drew additional criticism after admitting that he had not entirely read the legislation that he put forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.canada.com/technology/Video+Toews+admits+entirely+reading/6186446/story.html |title=Video: Vic Toews admits not entirely reading C-30 |publisher=Canada.com |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Feb 18, 2012 1:08 PM ET |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/02/18/pol-thehouse-vic-toews.html |title=Toews surprised by content of online surveillance bill - Politics - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2012-02-18 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; NDP MP [[Charlie Angus]] went so far as to ask "How can Canadians trust a minister who cannot even read his own legislation?".&lt;ref name="hansard125"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/hansards/2453/125/ |author=Charlie Angus |title=Public Safety |publisher=openparliament.ca |date=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, Toews had become a target of [[social media]] protests against the bill, including a [[Twitter]] campaign to inform him of Canadians' everyday mundane activities in an ironic bid to highlight their perceived loss of privacy if the bill should pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/02/16/pol-twitter-tell-vic-everything.html |title='Tell Vic Everything' tweets protest online surveillance |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Twitter user retrieved a copy of Toews' 2008 divorce particulars from the local Winnipeg courthouse and began spreading the contained information, as well as his spending habits,&lt;ref name="spend" /&gt; over the internet as retaliation to highlight the lack of privacy Toews' bill would afford Canadians.&lt;ref name="vik"&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/16/vikileaks-house-of-commons/|title=Vikileaks Twitter account on Vic Toews linked to ‘pro-NDP’ address in House of Commons|date=16 February 2012|publisher=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed that the [[IP address]] associated with the account originated within the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]] suggested the account was a creation of the NDP playing a "dirty, sleazy, Internet game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Steven|last1=Chase|first2=Stephanie|last2=Chambers|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/twitter-site-attacking-vic-toews-shut-down-as-tories-accuse-ndp-of-dirty-sleazy-tactics/article2342111/ |title=Twitter site attacking Vic Toews shut down as Tories accuse NDP of ‘dirty, sleazy’ tactics |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the account was quickly shut down, although later determined to belong to a Liberal staffer named Adam Carroll.&lt;ref name="spend"&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/16/vikileaks-twitter-account-shifts-focus-to-minister-vic-toews-spending-habits/|title=Vikileaks moves on to Vic Toews’ spending habits as Tories hint at online surveillance backdown|date=16 February 2012|publisher=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liberalattack"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/Liberal+staffer+Adam+Carroll+behind+Vikileaks+attack+Toews/6217188/story.html |title=Liberal staffer Adam Carroll behind Vikileaks attack on Vic Toews |publisher=Montreal Gazette |date=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] stated that Toews had referred them to online threats, and that they were "pondering" an investigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Canadian Press |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1134337--rcmp-pondering-investigation-into-threats-against-vic-toews?bn=1 |title=Canada News: RCMP pondering investigation into threats against Vic Toews |publisher=thestar.com |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] hacker collective stated that it would be launching "Operation White North", and threatened to reveal further details from Toews' private life if the bill were not withdrawn, noting they "will not allow a politician who allows his citizens no secrets to have any secrets of his own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/20/vic-toews-anonymous-hackers/ |title=Vic Toews targeted by Anonymous, Vikileaks revived &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=News.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymous released the name of Vic Toews' mistress in a release on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sb0-QF0ew8 |title=Vic Toews - You Were Warned: Identity of Vic Toews' Mistress, Stacey Meek, Revealed |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill C-30 was also one of the targets of the new initiative by Anonymous called "Operation Kill Billz" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cananon.info/opkillbillz.php |title=Canadian Anonymous &amp;#124; #opkillbillz |publisher=Cananon.info |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progression of bill ==

As a result of the opposition to the bill, the government referred it back to the [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights|House Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights]] for possible amendment before introducing it for [[Second Reading]].&lt;ref name="GlobeBacklash" /&gt; The bill was quietly shelved during the summer of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/john-ibbitson-remember-that-internet-surveillance-bill-its-dying-a-quiet-death/article4602164/|title=John Ibbitson: The quiet death of the Internet surveillance bill|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=2012-10-11 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing public opposition, the government announced in February 2013 that the legislation had been withdrawn. Nicholson stated that the government had "listened to the concerns of Canadians who have been very clear on this and responding to that". He added, “We will not be proceeding with Bill C-30. And any attempts to modernize the criminal code will not contain …warrantless mandatory disclosure of basic subscriber information or the requirement for telecommunications service providers to build intercept capability within their systems.”&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/harper-government-kills-controversial-internet-surveillance-bill/article8456096/|title=Harper government kills controversial Internet surveillance bill|first=John|last=Ibbitson|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=2013-02-11|accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill C-55, which was originally part of the original Internet surveillance legislation, is all that remains of the contentious Bill C-30. Bill C-55 is needed to bring Canada’s emergency wiretapping powers into conformity with a 2012 Supreme Court decision that struck down a 20-year-old law on the grounds that it did not require police to inform those who had been wiretapped after the fact or provide for any other oversight of the police power. Thus on account of this bill, any persons subject to government surveillance or wiretapping in Canada must legally be informed of the surveillance after the fact.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19812">'''Prudential capital controls''' are typical ways of [[Macroprudential regulation|prudential regulation]] that takes the form of [[capital controls]] and regulates a country’s [[capital account]] inflows. Prudential capital controls aim to mitigate [[systemic risk]], reduce business cycle volatility, increase macroeconomic stability, and enhance [[social welfare]].&lt;ref name="JAJ"&gt;Jeanne, O., A. Subramanian, and J. Williamson, 2012, Who Needs to Open the Capital Account? Washington, DC: Peterson Institute for International Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions from the Capital Controls in General==

The term “prudential” distinguishes such typical capital control measures from other general capital controls by emphasizing both the motive of “prudence” and the [[ex-ante]] timing. Firstly, the prudence motivation requirement says that such regulation should curb and manage the excessive risk accumulation process with cautious forethoughts for the purpose of preventing an emerging financial crisis and economic collapse. Secondly, the ex-ante timing means that such regulation should be taken effectively before the realization of any unfettered crisis as opposed to taking policy interventions after a severe crisis already hits the economy.&lt;ref name="NEW"&gt;Korinek, Anton 2011, [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp11298.pdf "The New Economics of Prudential Capital Controls: A Research Agenda"], IMF Economic Review 59, 523-561.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, prudential capital controls only apply to capital inflows because the excessive risk accumulation process that intrinsically creates the domestic financial vulnerability is usually associated with capital inflow rather than outflow.&lt;ref name="JAJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NEW" /&gt; Neely (1999) summarized some other nonprudential ways of exercising capital controls.&lt;ref&gt;Neely, C.J., 1999, “An Introduction to Capital Controls,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, November/December, pp. 13–30.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, restrictions on the volume and price for domestic currency and financial asset transactions, requirements for administrative approval of capital outflow, or limits on the amount of money that a citizen is allowed to take out of the country.

==History==

The history of capital free flows and controls unfolds with the history of financial globalization. At the onset, capital moved freely across borders during the [[Gold Standard]] period before [[World War I]]. After World War II, owing to the suspicion that a country’s macroeconomic instability could be due to the volatile capital flows, capital flows were deliberately managed under a variety of administrative controls as part of the governance in the international monetary [[Bretton Woods system]].&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;Michael W. Klein, 2012. "Capital Controls: Gates versus Walls," NBER Working Papers 18526, National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from early 1970s, increasingly relaxed capital controls along with the adoptions of [[floating exchange rate]] regime worldwide, though in the midst of concerns, announced the collapse of the Bretton Woods. Roughly from 1990s to 2009 known as the [[Washington Consensus]] period, it was widely accepted that the economic prosperity in the [[emerging market]] economies was attributed to the liberalization of their capital accounts and the increasing capital inflow. Then the policy prescriptions for these countries were that capital controls should be loosened and eventually abandoned.&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt;

The pro-capital flow arguments were not reviewed and critiqued until the [[Great Recession]] in the late 2000s. Emerging markets experienced strong capital inflows in the boom stage of a business cycle whereas they witnessed huge flow reverse and financial collapse in the bust period. This boom and bust cycles in international capital flows imposed significant welfare costs.&lt;ref name="NEW" /&gt; Then the theoretical underpinnings of the Great Recession crisis mechanism give a role for the prudential capital controls as an intervention to adjust the market imperfections in order to mitigate the systemic boom-bust cycle effects brought by the international capital flows&lt;ref name="JAJ" /&gt;

== Theoretical Paradigms for Prudential Regulations ==

To justify the necessity of the external regulation, [[market failure|market imperfections]] of a [[free market]] economy must be identified as socially inefficient and adjustable in the sense of [[Pareto efficiency|pareto improving]]. Three different theoretical paradigms can be used to illustrate the market imperfections and to introduce the role of prudential regulations: 1. The Agency Paradigm; 2. The Mood Swing Paradigm. 3. The [[Externality]] Paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;De la Torre, A. and Lze, A. (2009). Regulatory reform: Integrating paradigms. The World Bank. Policy Research Working Paper 4842.&lt;/ref&gt; The Prudential Capital Controls, as a particular form of prudential regulations, builds its theory foundation heavily on the paradigm of externalities.&lt;ref name="NEW" /&gt;

The Agency paradigm highlights various forms of [[principal-agent problems]]. An example is a [[moral hazard]] problem: considered as [[lender of last resort]] and provider of [[deposit insurance]], government induces the under-regulated banks to take excessive risks which creates the financial vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Farhi, Emmanuel and Jean Tirole. 2012. “Collective Moral Hazard, Maturity Mismatch, and Systemic Bailouts”. American Economic Review, 102(1):  60-93.&lt;/ref&gt; The moral hazard problem occurs in both the individual level and in a collective fashion, which justifies the prudential regulations.

In the Mood Swing paradigm, investors’ and consumers’ [[animal spirits (Keynes)|animal spirit]] induces an overly optimistic mood in good times of tracing the mispriced asset price signals, which accumulates excessive risk that runs down the financial system and the economy when there is a bad shock. Then ex-ante macroprudential regulations can play a role to manage overall mood and alert the risks.&lt;ref&gt;Akerlof, George A. and Shiller, Robert J. (2009). ''[[Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism]]''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4008-3012-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Justifying Prudential Capital Controls ==
Based on the Externality Paradigm, prudential capital controls, as one of the prudential regulations, are called to deal with the typical market imperfection known as the [[pecuniary externality]] in an open economy in order to curb the destabilizing effects of capital flows on domestic financial market.&lt;ref name="JAJ" /&gt;

=== Pecuniary Externality and Market Incompleteness ===


The key market imperfection, the pecuniary externality, is defined as a particular form of externality that a private agent's optimal decision affects the welfare of another agent through prices. Other market distortions, such as the [[incomplete markets]] in which private agents cannot fully insure their idiosyncratic risks, the [[information asymmetry]] and [[Capital market imperfections#Limited Commitment|limited commitment]] by which lenders do not know whether or not the borrowers will default and thus have collateral requirements on the borrowers, could aggravate the role of pecuniary externality.&lt;ref name="STIG"&gt;Greenwald, B. and Stiglitz, J., 1986. “Externalities in economies with imperfect information and incomplete markets”, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 101(4): 229-264.&lt;/ref&gt; When applied to the open economy context with incomplete markets that involves external borrowing and collateral constraint, the pecuniary externality can be used to explain the stylized fact of an open economy’s excessive borrowing from outside the country as seen by overly large amount of capital inflow: small, rational and individual domestic private agents take as given the exchange rates and asset prices that determine the external borrowing limit, but they do not internalize the price effects of their individual actions that their joint behavior could determine the level of exchange rates and asset prices and hence the degree of [[financial fragility]] in the economy.&lt;ref name="NEW" /&gt; In other words, private agents take too much risk.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne, O., and A. Korinek, 2010, “Excessive Volatility in Capital Flows: A Pigouvian Taxation Approach,” American Economic Review, Vol. 100, No. 2, pp. 403–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Then their aggregate borrowing exceeds the socially efficient level so that the risk of a financial systemic collapse is created and it could potentially lead to a financial crisis and economic downturn.&lt;ref name="NEW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bianchi, Javier. 2011. "Overborrowing and Systemic Externalities in the Business Cycle." American Economic Review, 101(7): 3400-3426.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Financial Amplification Feedback Loop.jpg|thumb|Financial Amplification Feedback Loop]]

===Financial Amplification Effects===

Such a problem of excessive borrowing rooted on the pecuniary externality and market incompleteness can be much more severe when some financial [[financial accelerator|amplification]] mechanism is present:&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman, 1999. "Balance Sheets, the Transfer Problem, and Financial Crises," International Tax and Public Finance, Springer, vol. 6(4), pages 459-472, November.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aghion, Philippe &amp; Bacchetta, Philippe &amp; Banerjee, Abhijit, 2000. "A simple model of monetary policy and currency crises," European Economic Review, Elsevier, vol. 44(4-6), pages 728-738, May.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, E.G., 2002, “Credit, Prices, and Crashes: Business Cycles with a Sudden Stop,” in Preventing Currency Crises in Emerging Markets, ed. by S. Edwards and J.A. Frankel (Chicago: University of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some negative shocks on the aggregate demand could lead to the real depreciation and the fall of domestic asset prices, which brings about the incipient adverse balance sheet effects that decrease the firm [[net worth]] and value of collateral. Consequently, the shrink of collateral value further constrains the private agents’ accesses to external borrowing through the binding borrowing constraint, which in turn results in the economy-wise spending cut and initial aggregate demand contraction is thus amplified. As shown in the graph depicting such a loop of effects, it is even striking that adverse shock on any step of this feedback loop could trigger this amplification of initial negative effects. Hence the overly large inflow of capital would potentially create a systemic risk and activate the amplification mechanism, which ultimately would generate large business cycle volatility, sudden collapse of the financial system and the economic recessions only given such a small incipient adverse shock on the feedback loop.&lt;ref name="NEW" /&gt;

===Policy Interventions===

To curb the amplification mechanism, mitigating the pecuniary externality that results in the excessive risk-taking and excessive capital inflow for an open economy is the key,&lt;ref name="JAJ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne, O., and A. Korinek, 2010, “Managing Credit Booms and Busts: A Pigouvian Taxation Approach,” NBER Working Paper, w16377.&lt;/ref&gt; As proved by Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986), in the presence of pecuniary externality and market incompleteness, some policy intervention that aims to reduce the pecuniary externality problem could achieve larger social benefits while incur only small social cost.&lt;ref name="STIG" /&gt; This justifies the role for external intervention. In the case of excessive external borrowing problem in the open economy, the prudential capital controls are the desired regulations that kick in to induce private agents to internalize the externality and to reduce the excessive risk-taking exposures.

==Optimal Policy Exercises==

Classic textbook policy recommendation that deals with externalities includes variations of [[Pigouvian Tax]].&lt;ref&gt;Varian, Hal R., 1992. "Microeconomic Analysis", Third Edition, W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pigouvian Taxation===

Pigouvian type of taxation can be introduced to induce private agents to internalize their contributions to the systemic risk so as to improve the social welfare with only small magnitude of social cost incurred.&lt;ref name="NEW" /&gt; In reality, the appropriate intervention does not have to be in the form of taxation.&lt;ref name="JAJ" /&gt; Restricting certain types of capital inflow or creating market to trade permits of liability issuance could be other forms of implementable policies. However, all the policies in a reduced form amount to take some effective Pigouvian Taxation to optimally control the capital inflow.&lt;ref name="JAJ" /&gt; It is argued that a straightforward tax on capital inflows is the best form of capital controls.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, John, 2002. "Proposals for Curbing the Boom-Bust Cycle in the Supply of Capital to Emerging Markets," Working Papers UNU-WIDER Research Paper, World Institute for Development Economic Research (UNU-WIDER).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Magnitude of Externalities.jpg|thumb|Magnitude of Externalities for Different Types of Capital Inflows]]

===Differentiated Controls and Optimal Magnitude===


The prudential capital controls should differentiate the types of capital inflow based on their contributions to the systemic risk. Since different forms of capital inflow would result in different probabilities of future capital outflows with different payoff characteristics in the event of a crisis, thus they lead to different degrees of negative externality.&lt;ref name="JAJ" /&gt;  In the case of an emerging market economy, Korinek (2010) found that dollar debt imposes a larger negative externality, followed by CPI-indexed debt that hedges against the exchange rate risk as dollar debt suffers, local currency debt and portfolio investment. The non-financial foreign direct investment often stays in the country when a financial crisis occurs so that it has no externalities. In other words, the pigouvian tax should be set equal to the magnitude of the externalities of different inflow types.&lt;ref name="Anton2010"&gt;Korinek, Anton, 2010. [http://www.korinek.com/download/CapitalFlows.pdf " Regulating Capital Flows to Emerging Markets: An Externality View "], Mimeo. University of Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Korinek’s (2010) estimated the optimal annual magnitude of externalities for various types of capital inflows for Indonesia. As the graph shows, the magnitude of externalities confirms the indicated order of magnitude for different types. Long run average indicates an average magnitude of externalities for the past 20 years. And red bars capture the magnitude during the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|1997-1998 Asian Crisis]]. It is clear that externalities of foreign capital inflow rise during booms and leverages were built up. After a crisis, the externalities are smaller once the economy was de-leveraged. Therefore, the magnitude of optimal tax should be time-variant which depends on the financial vulnerability over business cycles.  The optimal tax rates should be tighter during the boom and lowered even to zero during the bust.

==Prudential Capital Control Experience – Evidence from Peru==

During roughly the period of the first quarter in 2000 to the second quarter in 2008, Peru took some conventional controls on capital inflow and outflows along with prudential capital control measures as listed below:&lt;ref name = "IMF1"&gt;Habermeier, K., Kokenyne, A., and Chikako Baba, 2011. [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2011/sdn1114.pdf " The Effectiveness of Capital Controls and Prudential Policies in Managing Large Inflows"], IMF Staff Discussion Note 11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The average reserve requirement on foreign exchange deposits was reduced by 3 percentage points, and the mandatory minimum reserve requirement was lowered to 6 percent from 7 percent in 2004. Reserve requirements were increased from February 2008.
# The minimum unremunerated reserve requirement for both domestic and foreign currencies was increased from 6 percent to 9 percent by November 2008 and reduced to 7.5 percent a month later.
# The marginal reserve requirement on banks’ foreign currency liabilities was raised from 20 percent in 2004 to 50 percent in September 2008. The marginal reserve requirement for domestic currency deposits of residents and nonresidents was increased from zero to 15 percent in February 2008.
# The rate of remuneration on the reserve requirements in foreign currency was gradually increased from 2005 to 2007.
# Banks were required to make additional provisions if “unhedged” borrowers were not properly identified or adequate provisions had not been already established for foreign currency loans. in 2006, and they were required to consider in their lending decisions the overall exposure of borrowers with the entire financial system.
# Prudential limits were set on government securities in pension funds portfolios in May 2008.
As a result, these measures helped ease the appreciation pressures, significantly reduced net inflows, slowed credit expansion and lengthened the maturity of capital inflows.&lt;ref name = "IMF1"/&gt; However, it was recognized that Peru was one of the very few cases that prudential capital control measures were indeed effective. Other countries who ever took the prudential measures on capital controls are Croatia, Korea, Romania, Colombia, Thailand and Philippines etc.

== Effectiveness and Evaluating Empirics ==
It could be extremely hard to identify the “true” causal links between the prudential capital controls and the economic stability, financial development and economic growth with the conventional econometric tools. Therefore, the empirical evidences can be hard to directly infer on the effectiveness of prudential capital controls not to mention the mixed findings themselves.&lt;ref name="IMFPolicy"&gt;IMF 2012 [http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2012/111412.pdf "The Liberalization and Management of Capital Flows - An Institutional View"], IMF Policy Paper.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the reduced volatility could be explained by prudential inflow measures, then the reversed causality can be still valid since the more developed domestic capital markets with smaller fluctuations could also temper foreign investors’ incentive to inject capital inflow due to smaller interest differential.&lt;ref name = "NEW" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Klein" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korinek, Anton, 2011. "Hot Money and Serial Financial Crises," IMF Economic Review, Vol. 59, Issue 2, pp. 306-339&lt;/ref&gt; A few key findings to shed lights on the effectiveness of the prudential capital controls measures are listed below. Some are unambiguously positive, some mixed and some contingent on covariates:

# Prudential measures contributed to mitigating the macroeconomic impact of capital inflows in some cases.
# Targeted prudential measures often appear to be effective in reducing credit growth.
# The effectiveness of prudential measures often depends on the accompanying macroeconomic policies.
# Adding capital inflow controls to prudential measures often seems to have little additional effect on credit growth.
# The effectiveness of prudential measures in reducing foreign currency lending is mixed.
# Prudential measures usually did little to restrain asset prices.
# Prudential measures have helped to address some other financial stability concerns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9447">The '''Pujo Committee''' was a [[United States congressional subcommittee]] in 1912–1913 that was formed to investigate the so-called "money trust", a community of [[Wall Street]] bankers and financiers that exerted powerful control over the nation's finances.  After a resolution introduced by congressman [[Charles August Lindbergh|Charles Lindbergh Sr.]] for a probe on Wall Street power, congressman [[Arsène Pujo]] of Louisiana was authorized to form a subcommittee of the [[United States House Committee on Banking and Currency|House Committee on Banking and Currency]]. In 1913–1914, the findings inspired public support for ratification of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] that authorized a federal income tax, passage of the [[Federal Reserve Act]], and passage of the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]].

==Background and overview==

Beginning in the late 1800s, a concern regarding the power of bankers and monopolies began to grow. This led to a breaking point in July 1911, when Congressman [[Charles August Lindbergh]] asserted that a banking trust existed within the United States and that it should be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;"The 'Money Trust.'" ''The New York Times'', July 24, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; A move to create an investigation was then made on February 7, 1912, when the democratic Money Trust Caucus decided to pass House Resolution 405.&lt;ref&gt;"To Investigate the Money Trust." ''The New York Times'', February 8, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after this resolution's passage, amendments followed placing the investigation of the Money Trusts into the hands of then-chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee, [[Arsène Paulin Pujo]] of Louisiana. Pujo submitted a resolution, later amended and passed by a vote of 268-8, to establish the footing upon which the rest of the investigation would base itself.

As early as December 12, 1911, the lawyer [[Samuel Untermyer]] supported the creation of such an investigation, encouraging Lindbergh to continue fighting for its creation despite early setbacks. Untermyer, a strong proponent of the investigation himself, eventually came to be the committee's counsel.&lt;ref&gt;"Untermyer to Lead Money Trust Inquiry." The New York Times, January 12, 1912. See also page 53 of Pujo Committee Report and "Plan Inquiry Into the 'Money Trust,'" The New York Times, December 22, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being called the Pujo Committee, in March 1912, approximately a month after it received authorization, Pujo's wife became ill, forcing him to take an indefinite leave of absence from the investigation. His successor was Representative [[Hubert D. Stephens]] of Mississippi.

The investigation originally intended to examine data from 1905–1912 regarding all loans of $1,000,000 or greater; however, the Comptroller of the Currency furnished only a fraction of the overall data, hampering the investigation's scope. Three sections of the economy were the focus of attention: clearing houses, the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and the growing concentration of wealth within the economy. Witnesses were first examined on May 16, 1912.&lt;ref name=Report&gt;Pujo, Arsene. [https://www.scribd.com/doc/34121180/Pujo-Committee-Report-Report-of-the-Committee-Appointed-Pursuant-to-House-Resolutions-429-and-504-1912-1913-Pujo-Committee-Report ''Report of the Committee Appointed Pursuant to House Resolutions 429 and 504 to Investigate the Concentration of Control of Money and Credit'']. Washington: Government Printing Office. February 28, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings and aftermath==

===Clearing houses===
The Committee concluded that clearing house associations (associations created for the clearing of checks to and from individual banks) based in New York were gaining power at the public's expense. This was done via minimum capital requirements as well as predatory membership and discriminatory member policies. The report states, "Non-member banks must engage a member bank as its clearing agent, which in effect leaves its future up to the discretion a single bank."&lt;ref name=Report/&gt; This clause allowed member banks and the boards of these clearing houses to stifle any competition that might arise from smaller upstart banks by simply telling their member banks not to act as their clearing agents. In fact, the [[Panic of 1907]] started with the closing of the Knickerbocker Trust Co., when its member clearing bank (the National Bank of Commerce of New York) refused to act as its clearing agent anymore.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

===New York Stock Exchange===
The Committee discovered that, much like the clearing houses, certain predatory listing practices were forcing certain restrictions on both members and non-members of its exchange. Additionally, the Committee discovered large amounts of "unwholesome speculation" and price manipulation, citing examples of large groups colluding for profit and ultimately running companies out of business.

===Concentration and control of money and credit===
The Committee discovered several forces, such as the consolidation of banks and interlocking directorates (small groups of the same men serving as directors on several different boards) had led to increased wealth accumulation of 42.9% of America's total banking resources held by its twenty largest banks.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt; Furthermore, with much surprise to the investigators, it was found that "180 individuals" covering "341 directorships in 112 corporations...[possessed] $22,245,000,000 in aggregate resources of capitalization."&lt;ref&gt;"Morgan Reveals Business of Firm." ''The New York Times''. December 19, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it was concluded that a system known counterintuitively as "Banking Ethics" prohibited competition among banks and firms.

Despite the fact that lead attorney Samuel Untermyer had predetermined that no money trust would be found as part of the Investigation because “There is no agreement existing among these men that is in violation of the law”,&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/01/12/100604553.pdf "Say Money Trust is Now Exposed."] ''The New York Times'', January 12, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; and despite the refusal of aid by the Comptroller of the Currency, the failure of the Senate to pass the bill to amend section 5241 of the Revised Statutes, and the lack of any authoritative decision by the courts sustaining the committee's right to access the books of the national banks, the Pujo Committee Report concluded in 1913 that a community of influential financial leaders had gained control of major manufacturing, transportation, mining, telecommunications and financial markets of the United States.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}} The report revealed that at least eighteen different major financial corporations were under the control of a cartel led by J.P. Morgan, George F. Baker and James Stillman. These three men, through the resources of seven banks and trust companies (Banker’s Trust Co., Guaranty Trust Co., Astor Trust Co., National Bank of Commerce, Liberty National Bank, Chase National Bank, Farmer’s Loan and Trust Co.) controlled an estimated $2.1 billion.  The report revealed that a handful of men held manipulative control of the New York Stock Exchange and attempted to evade interstate trade laws.

The Pujo Report singled out individual bankers including [[Paul Warburg]], [[Jacob H. Schiff]], [[Felix M. Warburg]], Frank E. Peabody, [[William Rockefeller]] and [[Benjamin Strong, Jr.]].  The report identified over $22 billion in resources and capitalization controlled through 341 directorships held in 112 corporations by members of the empire headed by [[J.P. Morgan]].&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

Although Pujo left Congress in 1913, the findings of the committee inspired public support for ratification of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] in 1913 that authorized a federal income tax, passage of the [[Federal Reserve Act]] that same year, and passage of the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] in 1914. The findings were also widely publicized in the [[Louis Brandeis]] book, ''Others People's Money—and How the Bankers Use It''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[House of Morgan]] partners blamed the April 1913 death of [[J.P. Morgan]] on the stress of testifying in the Pujo hearings, though other health factors were certainly involved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[File:Vattensagspan2.JPG|thumb|Pykrete is made of 14 percent sawdust and 86 percent water by mass.]]

'''Pykrete''' is a frozen [[composite material]], originally made of approximately 14 percent [[sawdust]] or some other form of [[wood pulp]] (such as paper) and 86 percent [[ice]] by weight (6 to 1 by weight).  During [[World War II]], [[Geoffrey Pyke]] proposed it as a candidate material for a [[Project Habakkuk|supersized aircraft carrier]] for the British [[Royal Navy]]. Pykrete features unusual properties, including a relatively slow melting rate due to its low [[thermal conductivity]], as well as a vastly improved [[strength of materials|strength]] and [[toughness]] compared to ordinary ice. These physical properties can make the material comparable to [[concrete]], as long as the material is kept frozen.

Pykrete is slightly more difficult to form than concrete, as it expands during the freezing process. However, it can be repaired and maintained using [[seawater]] as a raw material. The mixture can be moulded into any shape and frozen, and it will be tough and durable, as long as it is kept at or below freezing temperature. Resistance to gradual creep or sagging is improved by lowering the temperature further, to {{convert|-15|C|F}}

==History==

===During World War II===
[[Geoffrey Pyke]] managed to convince [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] of the potential of his proposal (actually prior to the invention of pykrete) some time around 1942, and trials were made at two locations in [[Alberta]], Canada.  The idea for a ship made of ice impressed the United States and Canada enough that a {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}}-long, 1,000-ton ship was built in one month on [[Patricia Lake (Alberta)|Patricia Lake]] in the [[Canadian Rockies]]. However, it was constructed using plain ice (from the lake), before pykrete was proposed. It took slightly more than an entire summer to melt, but plain ice proved to be too weak. Pyke learned from a report by [[Herman Francis Mark|Herman Mark]] and his assistant that ice made from water mixed with wood fibres formed a strong solid mass&amp;mdash;much stronger than pure water ice. [[Max Perutz]] later recalled:

{{quote|
Then, one day, Pyke handed me a report that he said he found hard to understand. It was by Herman Mark, my former professor of physical chemistry in Vienna, who had lost his post there when the Nazis overran Austria, and found a haven at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. As an expert on plastics, he knew that many of them were brittle when pure, but could be toughened by embedding fibres such as [[cellulose]] in them, just as [[concrete]] can be [[Reinforced concrete|reinforced]] with steel wires. Mark and his assistant, Walter P. Hohenstein,&lt;ref&gt;Walter Peter Hohenstein (1908 - 1987), [http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hohenstein-2 bio]&lt;/ref&gt; stirred a little cotton wool or wood pulp&amp;mdash;the raw material of newsprint&amp;mdash;into water before they froze it, and found that these additions strengthened the ice dramatically.

When I had read their report, I advised my superiors to scrap our experiments with pure ice and set up a laboratory for the manufacture and testing of reinforced ice. Combined Operations requisitioned a large meat store five floors underground beneath Smithfield Market, which lies within sight of St. Paul's Cathedral, and ordered some electrically heated suits, of the type issued to airmen, to keep us warm at less than {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}} temperatures. They detailed some young commandos to work as my technicians, and I invited Kenneth Pascoe, who was then a physics student and later became a lecturer in engineering at Cambridge, to come and help me. We built a big wind tunnel to freeze the mush of wet wood pulp, and sawed the reinforced ice into blocks. Our tests soon confirmed Mark and Hohenstein's results. Blocks of ice containing as little as four percent wood pulp were weight for weight as strong as concrete; in honor of the originator of the project, we called this reinforced ice "pykrete". When we fired a rifle bullet into an upright block of pure ice two feet square and one foot thick, the block shattered; in pykrete the bullet made a little crater and was embedded without doing any damage.  My stock rose, but no one would tell me what pykrete was needed for, except that it was for [[Project Habakkuk]].|''I Wish I'd Made You Angry Earlier''|&lt;ref name = "Perutz p83 "&gt;Perutz, 2002, p83.&lt;/ref&gt; Perutz, Max}}

Perutz would later learn that Project Habakkuk was the plan to build an enormous aircraft carrier, actually more of a [[floating island]] than a ship in the traditional sense. The experiments of Perutz and his collaborators in [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Meat Market]] in the [[City of London]] took place in great secrecy behind a screen of animal carcasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gratzer |first=Walter |title=Max Perutz (1914–2002) |journal=Current Biology |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=R152–R154 |date=2002-03-05 |url=http://download.current-biology.com/pdfs/0960-9822/PIIS0960982202007273.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(02)00727-3 |accessdate=2008-01-12 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081216215050/http://download.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/PIIS0960982202007273.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramaseshan |first=S |title=Max Perutz (1914–2002) |journal=Current Science |volume=82 |pages=586–590 |date=2002-03-10 |publisher=Indian Academy of Sciences |issn=0011-3891 |hdl=2289/728 |doi= |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collins |first=Paul |title=The Floating Island |journal=Cabinet Magazine |issue=7 |year=2002 |url=http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/7/floatingisland.php |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tests confirmed that pykrete is much stronger than pure ice and does not shatter, but also that it sags under its own weight at temperatures higher than {{convert|-15|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="Max Perutz OM"&gt;{{cite news |title=Max Perutz OM |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2002-02-07 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/02/07/db0701.xml |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mountbatten’s reaction to the breakthrough is recorded by Pyke's biographer David Lampe:
{{quote|What happened next was explained several years after the war by Lord Mountbatten in a widely-quoted after-dinner speech. "I was sent to [[Chequers]] to see the Prime Minister and was told he was in his bath. I said, 'Good, that's exactly where I want him to be.' I nipped up the stairs and called out to him, 'I have a block of a new material which I would like to put in your bath.' After that he suggested that I should take it to the Quebec Conference."

The demonstration in Churchill's steaming bath had been most dramatic. After the outer film of ice on the small pykrete cube had melted, the freshly exposed wood pulp kept the remainder of the block from thawing.|''Pyke, the Unknown Genius''|&lt;ref&gt;Lampe, 1959, p136.&lt;/ref&gt; Lampe, David}}

Another tale is that at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] of 1943 Mountbatten brought a block of pykrete along to demonstrate its potential to the entourage of admirals and generals who had come along with [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]].  Mountbatten entered the project meeting with two blocks and placed them on the ground. One was a normal ice block and the other was pykrete. He then drew his service pistol and shot at the first block. It shattered and splintered. Next, he fired at the pykrete to give an idea of the resistance of that kind of ice to projectiles.  The bullet ricocheted off the block, grazing the trouser leg of Admiral [[Ernest King]] and ending up in the wall. According to Perutz's own account, however, the incident of a ricochetting bullet hitting an Admiral actually happened much earlier in London and the gun was fired by someone on the project&amp;mdash;not Mountbatten.&lt;ref&gt;Perutz, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these tests, the main Project Habakkuk was never put into action because of limitations in funds and the belief that the tides of the war were beginning to turn in favour of the Allies using more conventional methods.&lt;ref name=perutz48 &gt;{{cite journal |last=Perutz |first=M.

According to the memoirs of British [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|General Ismay]]:

{{quote|A good deal of consideration, much of it highly technical, was also given to the feasibility of building floating platforms which could either be used by fighters to support opposed landings until such time as airfields ashore were available, or act as staging points for ferrying aircraft over long distances. The idea as originally conceived by a member of Combined Operations staff, and vehemently supported by Mountbatten, was that these floating platforms should be constructed out of icebergs. They would be provided with engines which would enable them to steam at slow speed, and with refrigeration plants to prevent them melting. They would be unsinkable. The whole thing seemed completely fantastic, but the idea was not abandoned without a great deal of investigation. Various alternative methods of construction were then considered by the United States naval authorities, but in the end there was general agreement that carriers and auxiliary carriers would serve the same purpose more effectively.|''The Memoirs of Lord Ismay''|&lt;ref&gt;Ismay 1960, p319.&lt;/ref&gt; Ismay, General Lord}}

===After World War II===
[[File:Ice Dome - foto Bart van Overbeeke 28453.jpg|thumb|Construction of a pykrete-reinforced ice dome by [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]]]
[[File:Ice Dome - foto Bart van Overbeeke 28484.jpg|thumb|Daytime view of the ice dome]]
Since World War II, pykrete has remained a scientific curiosity, unexploited by research or construction of any significance. New concepts for pykrete however crop up occasionally among architects, engineers and [[futurist]]s, usually regarding its potential for mammoth offshore construction or its improvement by applying super-strong materials such as synthetic [[Composite material|composites]] or [[Kevlar]].

In 1985, pykrete was considered for a [[quay]] in [[Oslo]] harbour. However, the idea was later shelved, considering pykrete's unreliability in the real-world environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A New Chip Off an Old Block |first=Paul |last=Breeze |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1985-08-01 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since pykrete needs to be preserved at or below freezing point, and tends to sag under its own weight at temperatures above {{convert|-15|C|F}}, an alternative was considered that would guarantee effectiveness and public safety.&lt;ref name="Max Perutz OM"/&gt;

In 2011, the [[Vienna University of Technology]] successfully built a pykrete ice dome, measuring {{convert|10|m}} in diameter. They improved on an original Japanese technique of spraying ice on a balloon by using the natural properties of ice and its strength. This structure managed to stand for three months before solar radiation started melting the ice, rendering the structure unreliable.&lt;ref name="livescience.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/11704-austria-imbibe-ice-dome.html |title=In Austria, Imbibe in the New Ice Dome |publisher= |accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Johann Kollegger of [[Vienna University of Technology]] thinks his team's alternative new method is easier, avoiding icy sprayback onto the workers. To build their freestanding structure, Kollegger and his colleagues first cut an {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} plate of ice into 16 segments. To sculpt the segments to have a dome-like curve, the researchers relied on ice's [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] behavior. If pressure is applied to ice, it slowly changes its shape without breaking. One of the mechanisms by which glaciers move, called glacial creep, functions similarly, the researchers say.&lt;ref name="livescience.com"/&gt;

In 2014, the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] worked on a pykrete architecture project in [[Juuka]], Finland, which included an ice dome and a pykrete scale model of the [[Sagrada Família|Sagrada Familia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.structuralice.com/sagrada-familia-in-ice.html |title=Sagrada Familia in ice |date= |accessdate=18 October 2014 |website=structuralice.com |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to build the largest ice dome in the world. Due to human error, the plug to a compressor that kept the balloon inflated was pulled, leading to the balloon deflating. The team of Dutch students quickly re-inflated the balloon, and resprayed the part of the dome that had collapsed. They continued with their construction, and eventually opened the dome to the public. However within a matter of days the roof caved in; there were no visitors on the site at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/maailman_suurimman_jaakupolin_katosta_romahti_pala_juuassa/7056718 |title=Maailman suurimman jääkupolin katosta romahti pala Juuassa |website=Yle Uutiset |language=Finnish|trans-title=A piece of ice collapsed from the roof of the world's largest ice cap|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical properties==
The durability of pykrete is still debated. Perutz has estimated a crushing strength value of around {{convert|1100|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=perutz48/&gt;

A September 1943 proposal for making smaller pykrete vessels included the following table of characteristics:&lt;ref name="ADM 1/15677" &gt;[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], ADM 1/15677 – Proposals and inventions of Mr Geoffrey Pyke; gravity propelled ball bomb, pykrete and power driven rivers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
In 2009, the [[Discovery Channel]] program ''[[MythBusters]]'' [[MythBusters (2009 season)#Episode 115 – Alaska Special 2|episode 115]] tested the properties of pykrete and the myths behind it. First, the program's hosts, [[Adam Savage]] and [[Jamie Hyneman]] compared the mechanical properties of common ice, pykrete, and a new material specially created for the show, dubbed "super pykrete", using newspapers instead of woodpulp. Both versions of pykrete indeed proved to be much stronger than the chunk of ice, withstanding hundreds of pounds of weight. The super pykrete was much stronger than the original version.

The MythBusters then built a full-size boat out of the super pykrete, naming it ''Yesterday's News'', and subjected it to real-world conditions. The MythBusters vessel did not contain refrigeration units to keep the pykrete frozen as the original plans called for, and the boat had a much thinner construction than the massive ships proposed in World War II. Though the boat managed to float and stay intact at speeds of up to {{convert|23|mph}}, it quickly began to spring leaks as the boat slowly melted. After 20 minutes the boat was deteriorating, and the experiment was ended. The boat lasted another 10 minutes while being piloted back to shore. Though the boat worked, it was noted that it would be highly impractical for the original proposal, which claimed that an entire aircraft carrier could be built out of pykrete.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Naval Museum Library, 2001. http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_Habbakkuk.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Their conclusion was "Plausible, but ludicrous", since it would involve building vessels out of tens of thousands of tons of the material that would sink without being kept cool.

In 2010, the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Bang Goes the Theory]]'' [[Bang Goes the Theory#Series 3|episode 26]] tested a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}}, 5-tonne pykrete boat made with hemp rather than wood pulp.  All four presenters, [[Jem Stansfield]], [[Dallas Campbell]], [[Liz Bonnin]], and [[Yan Wong]], had to be rescued from Portsmouth Harbour after the boat took on water through the engine mounts. It eventually capsized after melting much faster than anticipated in the warmer-than-expected September waters.

[[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[Seveneves]]'' describes the fictional use of pykrete to construct [[low earth orbit]] habitats and space ship hulls for humans to survive the destruction that follows the breakup of the Moon.{{cn|date=March 2018}}&lt;!-- book citation and page reference needed --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1869">A '''quasi-corporation''' is&lt;ref&gt;https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2225&lt;/ref&gt; an entity that exercises some of the functions of a [[company (law)|corporation]], but has not been granted [[Juristic person|separate legal personality]] by [[statute]]. For example, a public corporation with limited authority and powers such as a county or school district is a quasi-corporation. In the [[United States]], such entities are often referred to as ''quasi-municipal corporations''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

A quasi corporation is a business which has operated as a corporation without completing the legal requirements, often in the period just before formal incorporation. It is a corporation formed with good faith intent but lacking a formality.

It is also a corporation consisting of a person or body of persons invested with some of the qualities of an artificial person, though not expressly incorporated, esp. the official of certain municipal divisions such as counties, schools districts, and the towns of some states of the United States, certain church officials, as a churchwarden, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/q/quasi-corporation/|title=Quasi Corporation Law and Legal Definition {{!}} USLegal, Inc.|last=Inc.|first=US Legal,|website=definitions.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sicilian Constitution of 1848''' was the constitution adopted during the [[Sicilian revolution of 1848]] by the newly proclaimed [[Kingdom of Sicily]].

Inspired by the English constitution, it was considered a very liberal constitution for its time, however its duration was short. The constitution's effect ended with the reconquering of Sicily by the army of [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies]] in May 1849.

'''Stieller v Porirua City Council''' [1986] 1 NZLR 84 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding council liability in tort for negligent inspection.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts|edition=4th|last1=McLay|first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Stiellers purchased a new house. Later, they discovered that they weatherboards were substandard, and that a stormwater drain was not connected.

Both defects had gone unnoticed by the local council building inspector.

The Stieller's sued the council for negligent building inspections.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal ruled that the council owed the buyers of the house a duty of care, and awarded damages against the council.

'''Footnote:''' The Court of Appeal decided Stieller v Porirua City Council on the same day as [[Brown v Heathcote County Council]] and [[Craig v East Coast Bays City Council]] which also involved negligent council building inspections.

      <comment>I added information on tax planning by companies that lowers the effective corporate tax rate significantly compared to the standard rate. Only the standard tax rate was included in the article previously. I referred the edit to three sources from mainstream media and from the European Commission, which is the central regulatory body of the European Union.</comment>

In [[Belgium]], taxes are collected on both state and local level. The most important taxes are collected on federal level, these taxes include an [[income tax]], [[social security]], [[corporate taxes]] and [[value added tax]]. At the local level, [[property taxes]] as well as various fees are collected. Tax revenue stood at 48% GDP in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Tax_revenue_statistics|title = EU - Tax Revenue Statistics |date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effective taxation rate in Belgium is commonly cited as among the highest in the world; see [[list of countries by tax rates]].

Income tax is calculated by applying a progressive tax rate schedule to taxable income, with rates that go from 25% to  a maximum rate 50%. The rates, as of 2015, are as follows:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://papayaglobal.com/countrypedia/country/be/|title=Belgium - CountryPedia - Papaya Global|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=|language=en-US|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, a long list of tax allowances can be deducted from both the employer and the employee, including a general deduction, benefits deduction, and a deduction for dependents. Tax deductions are granted according to the following table:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
*  Child benefits:
**  Employer - 7%
**  Employee - 0%
*  Unemployment:
**  Employer - 1.46%
**  Employee - 0.87%
*  Medical care in the case of sickness: 
**  Employer - 2.35%
**  Employee - 1.15%
*  Occupational illnesses:
**  Employer - 1%
**  Employee - 0%
*  Industrial accidents:
**  Employer -  0.30%
**  Employee - 0%
Employment income is also subject to social security contributions. Employee contributions are 13.07% and are deducted by the employer. In addition, the employer contributes about 35% of employees wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.kpmg.com/BE/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/TaxCard-2013-EN.PDF|title = KPMG - Tax Card|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; No ceiling for contributions apply on contributions for either employee and employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.swisslife.com/content/dam/id_corporateclients/downloads/ebrm/Belgium.pdf|title = Belgium Social Security|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Value-Added Tax (VAT) applies to most sales of goods and services. The standard rate of value-added tax is 21%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/vat-gst-essentials/pages/belgium.aspx|title = KPMG - Belgium: VAT essentials|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A lower rate of 12% applies to social housing, meals and margarine. Another reduced rate of 6%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VATGlobal|url=http://www.vatglobal.com/countries/belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; applies to foods, drinks, hotels and medicine. Certain goods and services are exempted from VAT by law, this includes exports, and financial services. The Belgian VAT is part of the European Union value added tax system. Smaller businesses with a turnover lower than €25000 are exempt as of 01/01/2016.

Corporate tax applies at a standard rate of 33.99%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pkf.com/media/1954296/belgium%20pkf%20tax%20guide%202013.pdf|title = PKF - Tax Card|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effective corporate tax rate in Belgium can be lowered through the use of various tax schemes. In 2016 the European Commission ruled that a Belgian corporate tax scheme, which had provided tax breaks to 35 multinational companies was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-42_en.htm|title = Decision by the European Commission on Belgian corporate tax scheme|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = European Commission|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-11/eu-orders-belgium-to-claw-back-763-million-illegal-tax-breaks|title = Belgium's $762 Million Tax Loophole Shut in EU Payback Order|date = 11 January 2016|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Bloomberg|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;Anheuser-Busch InBev is known to benefit from a very low effective corporate tax rate in Belgium, where the company has its headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/business/international/anheuser-busch-a-b-inbev-sabmiller.html|title = Anheuser-Busch InBev Aims Its Tax-Trimming Skills at SABMiller|date = 20 October 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = New York Times|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Third Way''' is a position akin to [[centrism]] that tries to reconcile [[right-wing]] and [[left-wing]] politics by advocating a varying synthesis of some [[centre-right]] economic and some [[centre-left]] social policies.&lt;ref&gt;Bobbio, Norberto; Cameron, Allan.''Left and right: the significance of a political distinction''. University of Chicago Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-226-06245-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-226-06245-7}}. Pp. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/458626.stm|title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— UK Politics — What is the Third Way?|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Way was created as a re-evaluation of political policies within various centre-left [[Progressivism|progressive]] movements in response to doubt regarding the economic viability of the state and the overuse of [[Economic interventionism|economic interventionist]] policies that had previously been popularized by [[Keynesianism]] but at that time contrasted with the rise of popularity for [[economic liberalism]] and the [[New Right]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?''. Oxford University Press, 2004. Pp. 3-4, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Way is promoted by [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Richardson. ''Contending Liberalisms in World Politics: Ideology and Power''. Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2001 Pp. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Third Way social democratic proponent [[Tony Blair]] claimed that the [[socialism]] he advocated was different from traditional conceptions of socialism and said: "My kind of socialism is a set of values based around notions of [[social justice]]...Socialism as a rigid form of [[economic determinism]] has ended, and rightly".&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Hastings, Alistair Mason, Hugh Pyper. ''The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought''. Oxford University Press, 2000. P677.&lt;/ref&gt; Blair referred to it as "social-ism" that involves politics that recognized individuals as socially interdependent and advocated social justice, social cohesion, equal worth of each citizen and equal opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freeden. Liberal Languages: Ideological Imaginations and Twentieth-Century Progressive Thought. Princeton University Press, 2004. P. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Third Way social democratic theorist [[Anthony Giddens]] has said that the Third Way rejects the traditional conception of socialism and instead accepts the conception of socialism as conceived of by [[Anthony Crosland]] as an [[Ethical socialism|ethical doctrine]] that views social democratic governments as having achieved a viable ethical socialism by removing the unjust elements of [[capitalism]] by providing social welfare and other policies and that contemporary socialism has outgrown the Marxist claim for the need of the abolition of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Giddens. ''Beyond Left and Right: The Future of Radical Politics''. 1998 edition. Cambridge, England, UK: Polity Press, 1994, 1998. Pp. 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Blair publicly declared support for a "new capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyblairoffice.org/speeches/entry/speech-by-tony-blair-at-the-new-world-new-capitalism-conference/|title=Speech by Tony Blair at the 'New world, new capitalism' conference|work=tonyblairoffice.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310133446/http://www.tonyblairoffice.org/speeches/entry/speech-by-tony-blair-at-the-new-world-new-capitalism-conference/|archivedate=10 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Third Way supports the pursuit of greater [[egalitarianism]] in society through action to increase the distribution of skills, capacities and productive endowments while rejecting income redistribution as the means to achieve this.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?''. Oxford University Press, 2004. Pp. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes commitment to [[balanced budget]]s, providing [[equal opportunity]] which is combined with an emphasis on [[Moral responsibility|personal responsibility]], the [[decentralization]] of government power to the lowest level possible, encouragement and promotion of [[public–private partnership]]s, improving [[labour supply]], investment in [[Human development (humanity)|human development]], preserving of [[social capital]] and protection of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Vaillancourt Rosenau.

New York Times Calls Wall Street Front Group "Center-Left"]. [[AlterNet]]. Retrieved 3 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific definitions of Third Way policies may differ between Europe and the United States.

== Origins ==
The term "Third Way" has been used to explain a variety of political courses and ideologies in the last few centuries. These ideas were implemented by [[progressives]] in the early 20th century.

The term was picked up again in the 1950s by German [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] economists such as [[Wilhelm Röpke]], resulting in the development of the concept of the [[social market economy]]. Later Röpke distanced himself from the term and located the social market economy as "first way" in the sense of an advancement of the free market economy.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Röpke: Die Lehre von der Wirtschaft, Erlenbach-Zürich (1951), p. 56-59&lt;/ref&gt;

In Czechoslovakia during the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968, reform communist economist [[Ota Šik]] proposed third way economic reform, as part of political liberalization and democratization within socialist society.

Subsequently, [[Enrico Berlinguer]], General Secretary of the [[Italian Communist Party]] in the 1970s and 1980s, used the term "Third Way" to advocate a vision of a socialist society which was more pluralist than the "[[real socialism]]" which was typically advocated by [[official communist]] parties, whilst being more economically egalitarian than social democracy. This was part of the wider trend of [[Eurocommunism]] in the official communist movement and provided a theoretical basis for Berlinguer's pursuit of a [[Historic Compromise]] with the Italian [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Sassoon|first=Donald|date=July 1984|title=Berlinguer: architect of Eurocommunism |url=http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/84_07_14.pdf|magazine=[[Marxism Today]]|publisher=[[Communist Party of Great Britain]]|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most significantly, [[Harold Macmillan]], British Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963, based his philosophy of government on what he summarized in a book, ''[[The Middle Way (Harold Macmillan book)|The Middle Way]]'' (1938).

== Modern usage ==
{{New Democrats|expanded=none}}
The Third Way has been defined as such: {{quote|[S]omething different and distinct from liberal capitalism with its unswerving belief in the merits of the free market and democratic socialism with its demand management and obsession with the state. The Third Way is in favour of growth, entrepreneurship, enterprise and wealth creation but it is also in favour of greater social justice and it sees the state playing a major role in bringing this about. So in the words of... Anthony Giddens of the [[London School of Economics|LSE]] the Third Way rejects top down socialism as it rejects traditional neo liberalism.|Report from the BBC, 1999|&lt;ref&gt;''[[#bbc|What is the Third Way?]].''BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Usage by social democrats ===
{{social democracy sidebar|development}}
A variant of the Third Way exists which approaches the centre from a social democratic perspective. It has been advocated by its proponents as an alternative to both capitalism and what it regards as the traditional forms of socialism, including [[Socialism (Marxism)|Marxist socialism]] and [[state socialism]], that Third Way social democrats reject.&lt;ref name="N.D. Arora. 2010"&gt;N.D. Arora. ''Political Science for Civil Services Main Examination''. Tata McGraw-Hill Education, 2010. 9.22.&lt;/ref&gt; It advocates [[ethical socialism]], [[reformism]] and [[gradualism]] that includes advocating the humanization of capitalism, a [[mixed economy]], political pluralism and [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref name="N.D. Arora. 2010"/&gt;

It has been advocated by proponents as a "competition [[socialism]]", an ideology in between traditional socialism and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Döring. ''Is ‘Third Way’ Social Democracy Still a Form of Social Democracy?''. Norderstedt, Germany: GRIN Verlag, 2007. Pp. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent social democratic proponent of the Third Way, [[Anthony Giddens]], has publicly supported a modernized form of socialism within the social democracy movement, but claims that "traditional socialist" ideology (referring to [[state socialism]]) that involves economic management and planning are flawed and states as a theory of the managed economy that socialism barely exists any longer.&lt;ref name="Flavio Romano 2006. Pp. 3-4"&gt;Flavio Romano. Clinton and Blair: the political economy of the third way. Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2006. Pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In defining the Third Way, Tony Blair once wrote: "The Third Way stands for a modernized social democracy, passionate in its commitment to social justice".&lt;ref&gt;''The Welfare State in Britain since 1945'' by Rodney Lowe.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Under the nominally [[centre-left]] [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) from 1983 to 1996, the [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]] governments pursued many economic policies associated with [[economic rationalism]], such as [[Floating currency|floating]] the [[Australian Dollar]] in 1983, reductions in trade [[tariff]]s, taxation reforms, changing from centralized wage-fixing to [[Enterprise Bargaining Agreement|enterprise bargaining]], heavy restrictions on union activities including on strike action and pattern bargaining, the privatization of government run services and enterprises such as [[Qantas]] and the [[Commonwealth Bank]] and wholesale deregulation of the banking system. Keating also proposed a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST) in 1985, but this was scrapped due to its unpopularity amongst both Labor and electorate. The party also desisted from other reforms, such as wholesale labour market deregulation (e.g. [[WorkChoices]]), the eventual GST, the privatization of [[Telstra]] and [[welfare reform]] including "[[work for the dole]]", which [[John Howard]] and the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] were to initiate after winning office in 1996.

Various ideological beliefs were factionalized under reforms to the ALP under [[Gough Whitlam]], resulting in what is now known as the [[Labor Left]], who tend to favour a more interventionist economic policy, more authoritative top-down controls and some socially progressive ideals; and [[Labor Right]], the now dominant faction that is pro-business, more economically liberal and focuses to a lesser extent on social issues. The Whitlam government was first to use the term [[economic rationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/johnquiggin/JournalArticles97/Econrat97.html|title=John Quiggin&amp;nbsp;— Journal Articles 1997 - Economic rationalism|work=uq.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gough Whitlam Labor government from 1972 to 1975 changed from a [[democratic socialism]] platform to social democracy, their precursor to the party's "Third Way" policies. Under the Whitlam government, [[tariff]]s across the board were cut by 25 per cent after 23 years of Labor being in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitlam.org/collection/1973/19730718_Tariff_Reduction/ The Whitlam Institute: The Whitlam Collection: Tariff Reduction&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050720062736/http://www.whitlam.org/collection/1973/19730718_Tariff_Reduction/|date=20 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Labor Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]]'s first speech to parliament in 1998 stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;Competitive markets are massive and generally efficient generators of economic wealth. They must therefore have a central place in the management of the economy. But markets sometimes fail, requiring direct government intervention through instruments such as industry policy. There are also areas where the public good dictates that there should be no market at all. We are not afraid of a vision in the Labor Party, but nor are we afraid of doing the hard policy yards necessary to turn that vision into reality. Parties of the Centre Left around the world are wrestling with a similar challenge—the creation of a competitive economy while advancing the overriding imperative of a just society. Some call this the "third way". The nomenclature is unimportant. What is important is that it is a repudiation of Thatcherism and its Australian derivatives represented opposite. It is in fact a new formulation of the nation's economic and social imperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kevin|last=Rudd|title=First Speech to Parliament|publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]]|date=11 November 1998|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/members/firstspeech.asp?id=83T|accessdate=9 December 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223222531/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/members/firstspeech.asp?id=83T|archivedate=23 December 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Matteo Renzi 2015.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|The former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is considered a Third Way politician]]
The Italian [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] is a plural [[social democratic]] party including several distinct ideologic trends. Politicians such as former Prime Ministers [[Matteo Renzi]] and [[Romano Prodi]] are Third Way-ers.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/298465.stm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Renzi's secretariat, the Democratic Party took a strong stance in favour of constitutional reform and of a new electoral law, on the road toward a [[two-party system]].

It is not an easy task to find the exact political trend represented by Renzi and his supporters, who have been known as ''Renziani''. The nature of Renzi's [[progressivism]] is a matter of debate and has been linked both to [[liberalism]] and [[populism]].&lt;ref name="ricerca.repubblica.it"&gt;{{cite web|author=Concita De Gregorio |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2011/10/31/il-populista-di-centro.html |title=IL POPULISTA DI CENTRO&amp;nbsp;— la Repubblica.it |language=it|publisher=Ricerca.repubblica.it |date=31 October 2011 |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ricerca.repubblica.it" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europaquotidiano.it/2013/09/06/la-cura-omeopatica-renzi-per-battere-berlusconi/ |title=La cura omeopatica Renzi per battere Berlusconi &amp;#124; Europa Quotidiano |publisher=Europaquotidiano.it |date= |accessdate=17 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006072326/http://www.europaquotidiano.it/2013/09/06/la-cura-omeopatica-renzi-per-battere-berlusconi/ |archive-date=6 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maria Teresa Meli of ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', Renzi "pursues a precise model, borrowed from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]", comprising "a strange mix (for Italy) of liberal policy in the economic sphere and populism. This means that on one side he will attack the privileges of trade unions, especially of the [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|CGIL]], which defends only the already protected, while on the other he will sharply attack the vested powers, bankers, ''[[Confindustria]]'' and a certain type of capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2013/novembre/11/Renzi_pensa_che_premier_punti_co_0_20131111_3a9d8bc8-4a9a-11e3-af53-696773e76c0b.shtml|title=Ma Renzi pensa che il premier punti a un futuro in Europa |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[Harold Macmillan]] wrote a book entitled ''The Middle Way'', advocating a compromise between capitalism and socialism, which was a precursor to the contemporary notion of the Third Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samuelbrittan.co.uk/spee3_p.html|title=Some reflections on the third way|last=Brittan|first=Samuel|date=20 November 1998|accessdate=10 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719021726/http://www.samuelbrittan.co.uk/spee3_p.html|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], "Third Way" adherents embrace [[fiscal conservatism]] to a greater extent than traditional economic liberals, advocate some replacement of [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] with [[workfare]] and sometimes have a stronger preference for market solutions to traditional problems (as in [[pollution market]]s) while rejecting pure ''laissez-faire'' economics and other [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] positions.

== Criticisms ==
In 1990, after the dismantling of his country's communist government Czechoslovakia's conservative finance minister [[Václav Klaus]] declared: "We want a market economy without any adjectives. Any compromises with that will only fuzzy up the problems we have. To pursue a so-called 'third way' is foolish. We had our experience with this in the 1960s when we looked for a socialism with a human face. It did not work, and we must be explicit that we are not aiming for a more efficient version of a system that has failed. The market is indivisible; it cannot be an instrument in the hands of central planners".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/34729.html No Third Way Out: Creating A Capitalist Czechoslovakia] ''Reason'', June 1990. Accessed 22 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should be noted that in historical context the "third way" proposals of 1960s Czechoslovakia were better described as "liberalized centrally-planned socialism" rather than the "socially-sensitive capitalism" that Third Way policies tend to have been identified with in the West.

Left-wing opponents{{who|date=October 2018}} of the Third Way argue that it represents social democrats who responded to the [[New Right]] by accepting capitalism. The Third Way most commonly uses market mechanics and private ownership of the means of production and in that sense it is fundamentally capitalistic.&lt;ref&gt;Flavio Romano. Clinton and Blair: the political economy of the third way. Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2006. Pp. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to opponents{{which|date=October 2018}} who have noticed this, other reviews{{which|date=October 2018}} have claimed that Third Way social democrats adjusted to the political climate since the 1980s that favoured capitalism by recognizing that outspoken opposition to capitalism in these circumstances was politically nonviable and that accepting capitalism as the current [[The powers that be (phrase)|powers that be]] and seeking to administer it to challenge ''laissez-faire'' capitalists was a more pressing immediate concern.&lt;ref&gt;Flavio Romano. Clinton and Blair: the political economy of the third way. Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2006. Pp. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Clarke]], a former United Kingdom [[Home Secretary]] and the first senior "Blairite" to attack Prime Minister Gordon Brown openly and in print, stated: "We should discard the techniques of '[[Triangulation (politics)|triangulation]]' and 'dividing lines' with the Conservatives, which lead to the not entirely unjustified charge that we simply follow proposals from the Conservatives or the right-wing media, to minimize differences and remove lines of attack against us".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/text/articles/2008/05/07/1210131068738.html TheAge.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, American lawyer and former bank regulator [[William K. Black]] wrote that "Third Way is this group that pretends sometimes to be center-left but is actually completely a creation of Wall Street—it's run by Wall Street for Wall Street with this false flag operation as if it were a center-left group. It's nothing of the sort".&lt;ref name="Bill-Black-TRNN-2013-03-31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bill-Black-HuffPo-2013-01-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bill-Black-AlterNet-2013-03-03"/&gt;

=== Third Way and social capital ===
The shift towards a political discourse heavily influenced by social capital is observable comparing the 1979 and 1997 Labour Party manifestos (Ferragina and Arrigoni 2016).&lt;ref name="psw.sagepub.com"&gt;[http://psw.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/04/06/1478929915623968.abstract Ferragina, E. and Arrigoni, A. (2016) "The Rise and Fall of Social Capital: Requiem for a Theory?", Political Studies Review]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the Labour Party professed a complete adherence to social democratic ideals and rejected the choice between a "prosperous and efficient Britain" and a "caring and compassionate Britain" (Labour Party, 1979: 23). Coherent with this position, the main commitment of the party was the reduction of economic inequality via the introduction of a wealth tax (Labour Party, 1979: 1). In the 1990s, this agenda drastically changed with the progressive dismissal of traditional social democratic ideology. In particular, New Labour de-emphasized the need to tackle economic inequality and instead focused its political strategy on the expansion of opportunities for all, keeping public intervention in the market to a minimum. In this context, the aim to foster social capital creation by holding together the modernization of the state and the creation of stronger social ties became the flagship of New Labour (Ferragina and Arrigoni 2016:5).&lt;ref name="psw.sagepub.com"/&gt;

This change of political orientation was based on a profound revision of social democratic principles. These principles were considered by New Labour to be an obstacle to the activation of evidence-based policy-making. In this context, the prevention of market failures, which is targeting child poverty and educational disadvantage, was preferred over the redistributive approach endorsed by the Labour Party during the 1970s. The new vision implied the full acceptance of market principles and pushed traditional social democratic values even further away. This ideological shift took place despite the fact that the period between 1979 and 1995 was characterized by the sharpest increase in economic inequality since World War II (Ferragina and Arrigoni 2016: 5).&lt;ref name="psw.sagepub.com"/&gt;

The importance attributed to the creation of social capital is symptomatic of New Labour's interest in civil society. This interest can be explained by the effect of growing individual freedom, fostered by economic and technological modernization, in a context where traditional forms of solidarity and interdependence are needed to prevent social disintegration; a "social paradox" already identified by the founding fathers of sociology. For this reason, New Labour considered the creation of social capital as a good antidote to the tension between traditional and modern values.

Tony Blair proposed to manage social change by unifying moral values, represented by the Tocquevillian quest for community and scientific evidence, used to inform evidence-based policy-making. According to Blair, the fusion of these two elements in the Third Way was the only remedy for the social paradox illustrated above. One could say, as Durkheim, that during an age of modernization and transformation the values cultivated in secondary groups need to be universally accepted because they confer a human face to a society dominated by competition and the pursuit of efficiency. In this vision, the creation of social capital balances growing individualism with the need for interdependence, serving as a sort of glue to prevent modernization from heading towards societal disintegration. After merging social capital’s argument and the Third Way discourse (Giddens,1998), New Labour also bridged theory and practice through policy making at various levels, that is in education, health and neighbourhoods; and attempting to measure the direct impact of these reforms on social capital. In this context, the objective of creating social capital through the empowerment of families and communities and the decentralization of social services became one of the leading driving forces of New Labour's political action (Ferragina and Arrigoni 2016: 5).&lt;ref name="psw.sagepub.com"/&gt;

== Weakening of Third Way ==
According to one article submitted in 2017 to an open-contribution website, marketMogul.com, the Third Way movement was at its peak in the 1990s and 2000s, but has since been on the decline, and by 2017 it becomes clear that the ideology is not as popular as it used to be outside of established Third Way circles. Third Way economic policies began to be challenged following the [[Great Recession]]. The rise of [[Right-wing populism]] has put the ideology into question. Many on the left have become more vocal in opposition to the Third Way, with the most prominent example in the United Kingdom being the rise of Labour leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]]. A large number of Third Way politicians have been either voted out of office or forced to change their positions due to the ideology's weakening base. However, in 2017, [[Emmanuel Macron]] was elected [[President of France]], which has given some hope to Third Way proponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themarketmogul.com/macron-third-way/|title=Emmanuel Macron: Third Way Redux|last=Mildren|first=William|publisher=The Market Mogul|date=5 June 2017|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Russian conquest of Turkestan]] Russia gained control of eastern Kazakhstan up to the current Chinese border. During the [[Dungan Revolt (1862-77)|Dungan Revolt]] China lost control of much of its western territory and power passed to various factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8vAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|title=Tso Tsung-tʼang and the Muslims: statecraft in northwest China, 1868-1880|first=Lanny B. |last=Fields|year=1978|publisher=Limestone Press|location=|page=81|isbn=0-919642-85-3|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871 Russia occupied the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]] territory. There was talk of permanent annexation, but Saint Petersburg declared that it was occupying the territory to protect its citizens.&lt;ref name="Millward2007"/&gt; Chinese authority in Xinjiang was reestablished by 1877. [[Wanyan Chonghou]] was sent to Russia to negotiate. In September 1879, he concluded the [[Treaty of Livadia]]. Russia would retain the Tekes valley at the southwest end of the Ili Valley and passes over the mountains to the Tarim Basin. China would pay 5 million rubles and various trade concessions were made. In January 1880 Chonghou returned to Peking and was greeted with indignation. He was declared to have betrayed his country, was arrested and later sentenced to death. [[Zeng Jize]], was appointed as the new ambassador. Russia refused to negotiate unless Chonghou was released and this was backed by the other powers. In August 1880 Chonghou was released and negotiations resumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paine|first=S. C.

Two years later (March 1883) Russia evacuated the province. There were some minor border problems and a final protocol was signed on {{OldStyleDate|31 October|1883|19 October}}.

The Russian side was represented by [[Nicholas de Giers]], head of Asiatic Affairs department of Foreign Ministry (who later in 1882 ascended to the Minister's seat), and [[Eugene Bützow]], Russia's Ambassador in China.

==Summary==
According to the treaty (Article 1), Russia agreed to return most of the occupied area to China. The Chinese government agreed (Article 2) to hold the residents of the area, regardless of their ethnicity and religion, harmless for their actions during the rebellion. The residents of the area would be allowed (Article 3) to stay or to move to Russian Empire; they would be asked about their choice before the withdrawal of the Russian troops.

Under Article 6 of the treaty, Chinese government would pay Russia 9,000,000 "metal rubles" ({{lang-ru|металлических рублей}}; {{lang-fr|roubles métalliques}}; probably, silver roubles are meant) to serve as a payment for the occupation costs, compensation for the claims of Russian subjects who lost their property during the rebellion, and for material assistance to the families of Russian subjects killed during the rebellion.

Article 7 set the new international border in the Ili Valley. The area west of the border was retained by Russia "for the settlement of the region's residents who will choose to become Russian subjects and will have to leave the lands that they have owned" east of the new border.

The treaty also provided (Article 8) for minor adjustments of the border between the two countries in the area east of [[Lake Zaysan]] (where today [[East Kazakhstan Province]] borders on the northern part of [[Xinjiang]]'s [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]]).

Article 10 of the treaty allowed Russia to expand its consular network in the northwestern parts of the Chinese Empire ([[Xinjiang]], [[Gansu]], and [[Mongolia|Outer Mongolia]]). Besides the consulates in Ili City ([[Yining (city)|Kulja]]), Tarbagatai (Chuguchak, [[Tacheng]]), [[Kashgar]] and Urga ([[Ulan Bator]]) provided for in earlier treaties (see [[Treaty of Kulja]], 1851), Russia would also open consulates in Suzhou ([[Jiuquan]]), and [[Turpan]]. In Kobdo ([[Khovd (city)|Khovd]]), Uliasutai ([[Uliastai]]), Hami ([[Kumul (city)|Kumul]]), [[Urumqi]], and Gucheng ([[Qitai County|Qitai]]), Russia would be allowed to establish consulates later on, as demanded by the volume of trade.

Article 12 affirmed the right of duty-free trade for Russian traders in Mongolia and Xinjiang. The treaty also contained various provisions designed to facilitate activities of Russian merchants and to regulate bilateral trade. An appendix to the treaty specified the list of border crossings the two countries were to operate.

== Consequences ==
The Treaty of Saint Petersburg was perceived as a huge loss and step backward by many in Russia, as Minister of War [[Dmitry Milyutin]] and the military, as notable commander [[Aleksei Brusilov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.hist.asu.ru/biblio/ruskit/08.html РУССКО-КИТАЙСКИЕ ПЕРЕГОВОРЫ О ВОЗВРАЩЕНИИ КУЛЬДЖИ.

Several thousands [[Dungans|Dungan]] ([[Hui people|Hui]]) and [[Taranchi]] ([[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]) families made use of the treaty to move to Russian-controlled territory, i.e. to today's south-eastern [[Kazakhstan]] and northern [[Kyrgyzstan]]. While some of them soon returned to China,  most stayed in Russian domains, and descendents of them have lived in [[Kazakhstan]] and Northern [[Kyrgyzstan]] ever since.

The border between the two empires set by Article 7 of the treaty remains the border between [[Kazakhstan]] and [[China]] until this day.

Historians have judged the Qing dynasty's vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness while it achieved military success against westerners on land, the historian Edward L. Dreyer said that "China’s nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea. At the start of the Opium  War, China had no  unified navy and no sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea; British forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go......In the Arrow War (1856-60), the Chinese had no way to prevent the  Anglo-French expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing. Meanwhile, new if not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the midcentury rebellions, bluffed Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in Central Asia, and [[Battle of Bang Bo (Zhennan Pass)|defeated the French forces on land in the Sino-French War (1884-85)]]. But the defeat of the fleet, and the resulting threat to steamship  traffic to Taiwan, forced China to conclude peace on unfavorable terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=PO  |first=Chung-yam |date=28 June 2013 |publisher=Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg |title=Conceptualizing the Blue Frontier: The Great Qing and the Maritime World in the Long Eighteenth Century |type= |chapter= |page=11 |docket= |oclc= |url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/18877/1/PhD_Dissertation_CyPO.pdf |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British observer Demetrius Charles de Kavanagh Boulger suggested a British-Chinese alliance to check Russian expansion in Central Asia.

During the Ili crisis when Qing China threatened to go to war against Russia over the Russian occupation of Ili, the British officer [[Charles George Gordon]] was sent to China by Britain to advise China on military options against Russia should a potential war break out between China and Russia.&lt;ref name="Fairbank1978"/&gt;

The Russians observed the Chinese building up their arsenal of modern weapons during the Ili crisis, the Chinese bought thousands of rifles from Germany.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Marshall|title=The Russian General Staff and Asia, 1860-1917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDXfGErwPtsC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=22 November 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25379-1|pages=78–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880 massive amounts of military equipment and rifles were shipped via boats to China from Antwerp as China purchased torpedoes, artillery, and 260,260 modern rifles from Europe.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006"/&gt;

The Russian military observer D. V. Putiatia visited China in 1888 and found that in Northeastern China (Manchuria) along the Chinese-Russian border,the Chinese soldiers were potentially able to become adept at "European tactics" under certain circumstances, and the Chinese soldiers were armed with modern weapons like Krupp artillery, Winchester carbines, and Mauser rifles.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006"/&gt;

Compared to Russian controlled areas, more benefits were given to the Muslim Kirghiz (Kazakhs) on the Chinese controlled areas. Russian settlers fought against the Muslim nomadic Kirghiz, which led the Russians to believe that the Kirghiz would be a liability in any conflict against China. The Muslim Kirghiz were sure that in an upcoming war, that China would defeat Russia.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006"/&gt;

Russian sinologists, the Russian media, threat of internal rebellion, the pariah status inflicted by the Congress of Berlin, the negative state of the Russian economy all led Russia to concede and negotiate with China in St Petersburg, and return most of Ili to China.&lt;ref name="Fairbank1978"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1131">'''United States extradition relations with Mexico''' can trace its history to the 19th century, when [[Mexico]] first became independent from [[Spain]].  Mexico has long held a reputation for being a haven for criminals fleeing the United States with the term "heading south of the border" often applied to those seeking to flee the [[United States legal system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26839">The '''Universal Periodic Review''' ('''UPR''') is a mechanism of the [[United Nations]] (UN) [[Human Rights Council]] (HRC) that emerged from the 2005 UN reform process.&lt;ref name="reform"&gt;[https://www.un.org/largerfreedom/ ‘In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all’], Report of the Secretary-General (A/59/2005), 21 March 2005; [http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UN/UNPAN021752.pdf World Summit Outcome], General Assembly resolution 60/1, 24 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly referred to as the UN-UPR, it was established by [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/A.RES.60.251_En.pdf resolution 60/251] of 3 April 2006, the UN-UPR periodically examines the [[human rights]] performance of all 193 UN Member States. It is intended to complement, not duplicate, the work of other human rights mechanisms, including the UN [[human rights treaty bodies]].This is the first international human rights mechanism to address all countries and all human rights. The Working Group on the UPR, which is composed of the HRC’s 47 Member States and chaired by the HRC President, conducts country reviews.

== Principles and objectives ==
HRC [http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_5_1.doc Resolution 5/1] of 18 June 2007 and HRC [http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/decisions/A_HRC_DEC_6_102.pdf decision 6/102] of 27 September 2007 elaborated on the UPR’s functions in its first cycle from 2008 - 2012. For the second and subsequent cycles, a few amendments were introduced to the UPR by [http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/RES/16/21 HRC Resolution 16/21] of 12 April 2011 and [https://web.archive.org/web/20111114172632/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/17session/docs/A-HRC-DEC-17-119.pdf HRC decision 17/119] of 19 July 2011, after a review by the HRC (for further details, see HRC review process below). HRC resolution 5/1 provides that the UPR should:&lt;ref name="IB"&gt;[http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_5_1.doc Annex to resolution 5/1], para. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Promote the universality, interdependence, indivisibility and interrelatedness of all human rights
* Be a cooperative mechanism based on objective and reliable information and on interactive dialogue
* Ensure universal coverage and equal treatment of all States
* Be an intergovernmental process, UN Member-driven and action oriented
* Fully involve the country under review
* Complement and not duplicate other human rights mechanisms, thus representing an added value
* Be conducted in an objective, transparent, non-selective, constructive, non-confrontational and non-politicized manner
* Not be overly burdensome to the concerned State or to the agenda of the HRC
* Not be overly long; it should be realistic and not absorb a disproportionate amount of time or human and financial resources
* Not diminish the HRC’s capacity to respond to urgent human rights situations
* Fully integrate a gender perspective
* Take into account the level of development and specificities of countries
* Ensure the participation of all relevant stakeholders, including [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) and [[national human rights institutions]] (NHRIs).

The objectives of the UN-UPR are:&lt;ref name="object"&gt;[http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_5_1.doc Annex to resolution 5/1], para. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The improvement of the human rights situation on the ground
* The fulfilment of the State’s human rights obligations and commitments and assessment of positive developments and challenges faced by the State
* The enhancement of the State’s capacity and of technical assistance, in consultation with, and with the consent of, the State concerned
* The sharing of best practice among States and other stakeholders
* Support for cooperation in the promotion and protection of human rights
* The encouragement of full cooperation and engagement with the HRC, other human rights bodies and the [[Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR).

HRC resolution 16/21 further provides that the second and subsequent cycles should focus on the implementation of the accepted recommendations and the developments of the human rights situation in the State under review.

== Procedure ==

=== UN-UPR cycle ===
While the first UN-UPR operated on a four-year cycle, the second was extended to four and a half years, and the third lasts five years. Forty-two States are now reviewed each year during three sessions of the HRC’s Working Group on the UPR, with 14 States reviewed at each session. The HRC determined the [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/uprlist.pdf order of review] for the first UPR cycle (2008-2012) on 21 September 2007 through the drawing of lots&lt;ref name="BF"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/BasicFacts.aspx ‘Basic facts about the UPR’], OHCHR.&lt;/ref&gt; and the same order will be maintained during the second and subsequent cycles. The first order of review was instructed by the resolution 5/1 requirements&lt;ref name="req"&gt;[http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_5_1.doc Annex to resolution 5/1], paras. 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt; that all 47 member States of the HRC be reviewed during their term of membership, in addition to a few other criteria.

=== Basis of country reviews ===
The basis of country reviews is: (a) the [[Charter of the UN]]; (b) the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]; (c) [[international human rights instruments|human rights instruments]] to which a State is party; and (d) voluntary pledges and commitments made by the State, including those undertaken when presenting their candidature for election to the HRC. Country reviews also take into account applicable [[international humanitarian law]].&lt;ref name="IHL"&gt;[http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_5_1.doc Annex to resolution 5/1], paras. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentation upon which country reviews are based ===
Country reviews are based on three documents:&lt;ref name="IB"/&gt;
* A 20-page national report prepared by the State under review
* A ten-page compilation of UN information (including Special Procedures reports, human rights treaty body reports, and other relevant UN documentation) prepared by OHCHR
* A ten-page summary of information received from stakeholders (including NHRIs, NGOs, and other civil society actors) also prepared by the OHCHR

In decision 6/102, the HRC provided guidelines for the preparation of information under the UPR. It specifies that States, in preparing national reports, should address/provide:
* A description of the methodology and the broad consultation process followed for the preparation of information provided under the UPR
* Background of the country under review and framework (particularly normative and institutional framework) for the promotion and protection of human rights: constitution, legislation, policy measures, national jurisprudence, human rights infrastructure including NHRIs, and scope of international obligations identified in the “basis of review” in resolution 5/1
* Promotion and protection of human rights on the ground: implementation of international human rights obligations identified in the “basis of review” in resolution 5/1, national legislation and voluntary commitments, NHRI activities, public awareness of human rights, cooperation with human rights mechanisms
* Identification of achievements, best practices, challenges and constraints
* Key national priorities, initiatives and commitments that the State concerned intends to undertake to overcome those challenges and constraints and improve its human rights situation
* Expectations of the State concerned in terms of capacity-building and requests, if any, for technical assistance; and
* In the second and subsequent UPR cycles, this should also contain a presentation by the State concerned of its work on the follow-up to the previous review.

=== Working Group on the UPR ===
The Working Group on the UPR is composed by the 47 Member States of the HRC, chaired by the HRC President and conducts country reviews. The Working Group held its first review in 2008. It allocates three and a half hours to each review, 70 minutes of which is given to the State under review to discuss its domestic human rights framework, measures taken to promote and protect human rights in country, human rights issues of particular national pertinence, and steps taken to address and redress violations. It is also an opportunity for the State to present voluntary human rights pledges and commitments. An interactive dialogue of 140 minutes follows the State’s presentation, during which UN member States question the State and make recommendations towards the improvement of its human rights situation and performance. It is worth noting that all 193 UN member states (both HRC members and not) can take the floor.

A wide variety of issues have been addressed during the country reviews and potentially all human rights issues could be addressed during this session. While the counting of the actual number of recommendations is complicated by the fact that they are clustered together in the Working Group report, the NGO [[UPR Info]] has calculated the first cycle of the UPR to have provided a total of 21,356 recommendations and 599 voluntary pledges.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upr-info.org/database/index.php?limit=0&amp;f_SUR=All&amp;f_SMR=All&amp;order=&amp;orderDir=ASC&amp;orderP=true&amp;f_Issue=All&amp;issueFilterType=OR&amp;searchReco=&amp;resultMax=300&amp;response=&amp;action_type=&amp;session=12-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1&amp;SuRRgrp=&amp;SuROrg=&amp;SMRRgrp=&amp;SMROrg=&amp;pledges=RecoAndPledge&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The role of the Troika and drafting of the Working Group report ===

Each review is facilitated by a group of three States, known as the “troika”, that serve as rapporteurs. The troika is responsible for receiving the advanced questions from UN member States to the country under review. The second role of the troika is to prepare an outcome document on the review, which includes a summary of the review proceedings, recommendations suggested by States, conclusions, and voluntary commitments presented by the State under review. The outcome document is prepared with the assistance of the UPR secretariat and the recommendations contained in the outcome of the review should preferably be clustered thematically with the full involvement and consent of the State under review and the States that made the recommendations.&lt;ref name="HRCResolution16/21"&gt;[http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/RES/16/21 "Review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights Council"] at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adoption ===

Thirty minutes are allocated to the adoption of the outcome document at a later stage in the same Working Group session, during which the State under review is given a preliminary opportunity to indicate whether it supports the recommendations suggested to it by States as well as the conclusions reflected in the outcome document. Once adopted, the outcome document is transferred to the HRC for discussion and adoption in plenary. In the intervening period between the Working Group and plenary sessions, the reviewed State is expected to confirm which UPR recommendations it accepts and does not accept.

=== HRC plenary session ===
The UPR is a standing item on the HRC’s agenda (item 6). At each HRC session, time is allocated to the consideration and adoption of the outcome documents transferred from the Working Group on the UPR. An hour is allocated to the adoption of each document, during which the reviewed State is offered the opportunity to present replies to questions or issues not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue at the Working Group.&lt;ref name="action"&gt;[http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_5_1.doc Annex to resolution 5/1], para. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; HRC member and observer States are also given the opportunity to express their views on the outcome of the review before the HRC takes action on it.&lt;ref name="actionB"&gt;[http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_5_1.doc Annex to resolution 5/1], para. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; NHRIs with ‘A’ status&lt;ref name="NHRI"&gt;NHRIs accredited by the [http://nhri.net/default.asp?PID=85&amp;DID=0 International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions](ICC) as compliant with the [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/parisprinciples.htm Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326052023/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/parisprinciples.htm |date=2011-03-26 }} (Paris Principles).&lt;/ref&gt; and NGOs in consultative status with the UN [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) have the opportunity to make ‘general comments’ before the adoption of the outcome report.&lt;ref name="GC"&gt;[http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_5_1.doc Annex to resolution 5/1], para. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only opportunity for civil society to take the floor during the UPR.

=== Follow-up to UPR outcome ===

While the outcome of the review, as a cooperative mechanism, should be implemented primarily by the State concerned, States are encouraged to conduct broad consultations with all relevant stakeholders in this regard.

States are encouraged to provide the Council, on a voluntary basis, with a midterm update on follow-up to accepted recommendations. As of 20 February 2013, 28 countries so far have provided the HRC with an implementation report.&lt;ref name="UPR Implementation"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRImplementation.aspx "UPR Implementation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Resolution 16/21, other relevant stakeholders are encouraged to include information on the follow-up to the preceding review in their contributions. The summary of the information provided by other relevant stakeholders should contain, where appropriate, a separate section for contributions by the national human rights institution of the State under review that is accredited in full compliance with the Paris Principles.

The Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance, established by the Council in its resolution 6/17, should be strengthened and operationalized in order to provide a source of financial and technical assistance to help countries to implement the recommendations emanating from their review.

States may request the United Nations representation at the national or regional level to assist them in the implementation of the follow-up to their review. Financial and technical assistance for the implementation of the review should support national needs and priorities, as may be reflected in national implementation plans.&lt;ref name="HRCResolution16/21"/&gt;

The NGO [[UPR Info]] has from 2011 to 2014 undertaken 165 assessments at a two-years distance after the review in order to see how the recommendations (the main UPR outcome) are implemented,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.upr-info.org/followup/ The Follow-up Programme on UPR recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt; and what is the real effect of the UPR on the ground. In 2012 it published its first [https://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/general-document/pdf/2012_on_the_road_to_implementation.pdf study] on the assessment of these implementations by 66 countries. A second publication followed in 2014, titled [https://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/general-document/pdf/2014_beyond_promises.pdf Beyond Promises], assessed 165 countries and shared best practices observed from States, NHRIs, and NGOs. A third publication, released in 2016 and dubbed [https://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/general-document/pdf/2016_the_butterfly_effect.pdf The Butterfly Effect], aimed to spread UPR best practices and inspire all actors.

=== State non-cooperation with the UPR ===
After exhausting all efforts to encourage a State to cooperate with the UPR mechanism, the HRC will address, as appropriate, cases of persistent non-cooperation with the mechanism.&lt;ref name="NC"&gt;[http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_5_1.doc Annex to resolution 5/1], para. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first case where persistent non-cooperation was discussed is Israel's UPR. Israel was not reviewed as scheduled on 29 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upr-info.org/en/news/israel-absent-its-own-upr&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the HRC discussed in March&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upr-info.org/en/news/human-rights-council-discusses-cases-non-cooperation&lt;/ref&gt; and June&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upr-info.org/en/news/hrc-president-presents-report-dialogue-israel&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 the issue of "persistent non-cooperation". Eventually, Israel resumed its cooperation with the HRC and was reviewed on 29 October 2013,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upr-info.org/en/news/universality-preserved-israel-expected-be-reviewed-tuesday-29-october-2013&lt;/ref&gt; but the HRC missed the opportunity to define what "persistent non-cooperation" is.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upr-info.org/en/news/non-cooperation-upr-paving-way&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stakeholders UPR contribution opportunities ===
The rules governing the participation of NHRIs and NGOs at the HRC, and therefore in the UPR mechanism, are prescribed by resolution 5/1, which states that their participation shall be based on the ‘practices observed by the [former] Commission on Human Rights, while ensuring the most effective contribution of these entities’.&lt;ref name="Part"&gt;[http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_5_1.doc Annex to resolution 5/1], at rule 7. Resolution 5/1 also stipulates that NGO participation is to be informed by [https://www.un.org/documents/ecosoc/res/1996/eres1996-31.htm Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/31] of 25 July 1996, and NHRI participation by [http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-74.doc CHR resolution 2005/74] of 20 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the UPR is an intergovernmental process, a number of opportunities for contribution are available to non-governmental stakeholders. These include:
* Participating in national consultations for the preparation of a State’s national report. States are encouraged to undertake broad national consultation processes towards the preparation of their national reports
* Submitting information to State reviews. Submissions may be incorporated into the OHCHR-prepared summary of stakeholders’ information discussed above
* Attending the review of the State at the Working Group on the UPR. Stakeholders may attend Working Group sessions, but cannot participate in the interactive dialogue
* Attending the HRC session at which the outcome report on a State is adopted. ‘A’ status [[National human rights institutions|NHRIs]] and [[ECOSOC]]-accredited NGOs may make ‘general comments’ before the adoption of the outcome report
* Submitting written statements under HRC agenda item 6 (UPR). NHRIs and ECOSOC-accredited NGOs can submit written statements
* When appropriate, working on the follow-up of UPR recommendations

== HRC review process ==
In resolution 60/251, the General Assembly required the HRC to review and report on its work and functioning after its first five years.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/A.RES.60.251_En.pdf General Assembly resolution 60/251] at operative para. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, the HRC established the open-ended intergovernmental working group on the review of the work and functioning of the HRC (composed by the 47 member States of the HRC) to lead its review process.&lt;ref name="WG"&gt;HRC resolution 12/1 of 12 October 2009, [http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/12/L.28 ‘Open-ended intergovernmental working group on the review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights Council’].&lt;/ref&gt; Chaired by the then HRC President (Ambassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow of Thailand), the Working Group met for two substantive sessions. The first Working Group session took place on 25–29 October 2010; the second session was held on 7, 17-18, and 23–24 February 2011.

On 25 March 2011, the HRC adopted as resolution 16/21 the outcome of its review of the work and functioning of the HRC, later followed by HRC decision 17/119 of 19 July 2011 with the following changes to the UPR:&lt;ref name="NewModalities"&gt;[https://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/news/new_upr_modalities_second_cycle.pdf "New UPR Modalities for the Second Cycle"]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Length of the next cycles: The second and subsequent cycles will last 4.5 years with 14 sessions per cycle
* Number of States per session : 14 States will be reviewed per session, in a total of 42 states per year
* Duration of the review : Each country review will last 3.5 hours. The State under Review (SuR) will be given 70 minutes and other States 140 minutes
* Order of review: The order of review will be exactly the same. As there will be only by 14 States reviewed per session, the two last States of session 1 will be moved to the beginning of session 2, the last four of session 2 will be moved to the beginning of session 3, etc.
* Focus of the next cycles: The second and subsequent cycles of the review should focus on, inter alia, the implementation of the accepted recommendations and the developments of the human rights situation in the SuR
* List of speakers: For each review, States will be arranged in English alphabetical order and the first state of the list will be drawn by lot. States will be able to swap place and all States will be given the floor. If needed be, time per speakers will be reduced to two minutes each or the 140 minutes will be divided by the number of speakers.
* General guidelines: The General Guidelines Decision A/HRC/DEC/6/102 for the drafting of the three reports that form the basis of the review were slightly modified to give greater emphasis on the need for States to report on the implementation of recommendations
* Clustering of recommendations: The recommendations contained in the UPR outcome document should preferably be clustered thematically, with the full involvement and consent of the State under review and the States that made the recommendations
* Responses to recommendations: States should clearly communicate to the Council, in a written format preferably prior to the Council plenary, its positions on all received recommendations
* Mid-term reports: States are encouraged to provide the Council, on a voluntary basis, with a midterm update on follow-up to accepted recommendations
* Role of [[National human rights institutions]] : National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) with A status will have a dedicated section in the summary of other stakeholders’ information and will be given the floor directly after the SuR during the adoption at the HRC plenary session
* Role of NGOs : States are encouraged to conduct broad consultations with all relevant stakeholders on the follow-up. Other relevant stakeholders are encouraged to include information on the follow-up to the preceding review in their contributions

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6968">'''''Čelnik''''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|челник}}) was a high court title in the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom of Serbia]], [[Serbian Empire]] and [[Serbian Despotate]].
 
In its early form, the holder was entrusted with the security of property belonging to the Orthodox Church from the aristocrats (compare Catholic [[Vidame]]), so the holder appeared in the role of a judge or executor of the ruler's decisions, in disputes between the church and the nobility.
 
At the beginning of the 15th century, during the Serbian Despotate, the title of '''''veliki čelnik''''' (велики челник, "grand čelnik") was the equivalent of [[count palatine]] and was the highest court title, with the title-holders holding great provinces, property and honours.

== History ==
During the reign of King [[Stefan Milutin]] (r. 1282–1321), the title holder was entrusted with the security of property belonging to the Church from the aristocrats, so the holder appeared in the role of a judge or executor of the ruler's decisions, in disputes between the church and the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Сима Ћирковић|author2=Раде Михальчић|title=Лексикон српског средњег века|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AypYAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Knowledge|page=813}} {{quote|На двору краља Милутина 1284. године налазио се челник Градислав, а касније ( 1 305/06) челник Бранко. Овој категорији челника биће поверена заштита црквених земљопоседа од самовоље властеле, па се они појављују у улози судија или извршитеља владаревих одлука, када су у питању спорови између цркава и властеле.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the title of ''čelnik'' was of a higher rank than ''[[stavilac]]'', but lower than ''[[kaznac]]'' and ''[[tepčija]]'', with ''[[vojvoda]]'' being the supreme title.{{sfn|Blagojević|2001|p=211}} It is unclear if there was one or several with that title at the court at that time.{{sfn|Blagojević|2001|p=211}}

During King Stefan Dečanski's reign there were two or three title holders at the same time.{{sfn|Blagojević|2001|p=212}} During Stefan Dušan's reign, the title of '''''veliki čelnik''''' is first mentioned. The ''veliki čelnik'' supervised over several čelniks,{{sfn|Blagojević|2001|p=209}} each ''čelnik'' being a commander of military fortifications (and presumably its troops){{sfn|Blagojević|2001|p=213}} or a senior (''starešina'') of a larger number of villages.{{sfn|Blagojević|2001|p=215}} After [[Jovan Oliver]] and Dimitrije, it seems that the title was not given at the court of Stefan Dušan.{{sfn|Blagojević|2001|p=237}} During the service of Branilo (fl. 1347) and Đurica (fl. 1350), there is also a mention of Andronik, a čelnik in Polog, though he likely was not of the same category as the former two.{{sfn|Blagojević|2001|p=215}}

== Veliki čelnik ==
At the beginning of the 15th century, during the [[Serbian Despotate]], the title of ''veliki čelnik'' was the equivalent of [[count palatine]] and was the highest court title, with the title-holders holding great provinces, property and honours.
