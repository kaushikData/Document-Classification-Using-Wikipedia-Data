Athleisure can be considered as a [[fashion industry]] movement, enabled by improved textile materials, which allow sportswear to be more versatile, comfortable, and fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Aktar | first=Alev | title=Active or Idle, Everyone Is Wearing Gym Clothes Now | website=Entrepreneur | date=2014-11-30 | url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/239685 | ref=harv | access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
By some accounts, the athleisure trend grew out of women wearing yoga pants.&lt;ref name=twsLATimes&gt;ADAM TSCHORN, February 11, 2015, Los Angeles Times, [http://www.latimes.com/fashion/alltherage/la-ar-mens-new-york-fashion-week-20150211-story.html New York Fashion Week: For men, athleisure gains ground on workwear], Retrieved May 6, 2015, "....athleisure is on its way in, with the trend that started with luxe sweatpants a year ago..."&lt;/ref&gt; Another account suggests that the trend came about because people could wear them for multiple occasions without having to change, which meant greater convenience since people did not have to carry an extra gym outfit on the way to the office, for example.&lt;ref name="twsNPR" /&gt; A decade ago, denim workwear uniforms were more popular, but today, athleisure is increasingly popular in places such as public streets and fashion stores and fashion runways.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sourcingjournalonline.com/workout-workwear-athleisure-works-new-angle/|title=From Workout to Workwear, Athleisure Works a New Angle - Sourcing Journal|date=2017-02-02|work=Sourcing Journal|access-date=2017-05-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sportswear that had been worn exclusively in gyms is now being worn elsewhere by young adults and fitness-conscious consumers and has been accompanied by a relaxation in dress codes. Its popularity may have stemmed from its ability to fill a gap in the market, when sportswear was once merely functional rather than stylish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2016/10/06/the-athleisure-trend-is-here-to-stay/#598ae34028bd|title=The Athleisure Trend Is Here To Stay|last=Speculations|first=Great|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to innovations in textiles and technology, improvements have been made in functionality, such that garments and footwear have become more breathable, lightweight, and waterproof. The new garments are performance enhancing, in the sense that they allow wearers to carry out everyday activities easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodrum|first=Alison|date=2016-04-02|title=The dress issue: introduction|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11745398.2016.1169581|journal=Annals of Leisure Research|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145–161|doi=10.1080/11745398.2016.1169581|issn=1174-5398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer trends==
Athleisure buyers desire the active lifestyle that comes with each purchase.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fungglobalretailtech.com/research/gym-clothes-making-way-gym-primer-athleisure/|title=A Primer on Athleisure - Fung Global Retail &amp; Technology|website=fungglobalretailtech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The styles, colors, and fabrics of athleisure suggest a broader emphasis on fashion as opposed to functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/athleisures-winners-and-losers|title=Athleisure’s Winners and Losers|date=2016-11-16|work=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2017-05-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Sales trends==
[[File:Wunder Groove Crop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Athleisure clothing frequently uses accents of brightly-colored fabric against a dark background.]]
Reports in ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' describe the athleisure market as growing,&lt;ref name="twsWSJ1"/&gt; displacing typical workwear styles, and cutting in to sales of [[jeans]],&lt;ref name=twsUSAToday3&gt;Anne D'Innocenzio, Associated Press, September 6, 2014, ''[[USA Today]]'', [https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/09/06/jeans-face-an-uncertain-future-amid-yoga-wear-rage/15146265/ Jeans face uncertain future amid yoga wear rage], Retrieved May 6, 2015, "...Levi Strauss, which invented the first pair of blue jeans 141 years ago, is among jean makers that acknowledge their women's business has been hurt ..."&lt;/ref&gt; with a market size in 2014 as $35 billion, representing an 8% increase from the previous year.&lt;ref name=twsUSAToday&gt;Natalie DiBlasio, December 29, 2014, ''[[USA Today]]'', [https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2014/12/23/athleisure-activewear-shopping-holiday/19616825/ "Retailers rush to tap Millennial 'athleisure' market"], Retrieved May 6, 2015, "...Sales for 'athleisure,' a new clothing category ... comfy-casual-athletic action....Millennial women are flocking to athleisure clothing — fashionable, dressed up sweats and exercise clothing—for their casual go-to clothing for both leisure and work. For many of the Millennials, jeans have dropped to a distant second for weekend wear..."&lt;/ref&gt; According to one estimate, the athleisure market, including footwear, was $270 billion in 2016, and was estimated to grow by 30% by the year 2020.&lt;ref name=Digiday1&gt;Milnes, H., March 22, 2016, ''[[Digiday]]'', [http://digiday.com/brands/designer-sneakers-200-leggings-luxury-stepped-rise-athleisure/ Designer sneakers and $200 leggings: How luxury stepped into the rise of athleisure], Retrieved May 30, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market size==
In 2016, the global athleisure sector was valued at over $83 billion USD,&lt;ref name="blog.trendstop.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.trendstop.com/2016/03/the-rise-of-athleisure/|title=Trendstop {{!}} The Rise of Athleisure|website=blog.trendstop.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the U.S. market reported a 16% increase to $44 billion USD. A 30% growth is also predicted in Asia and the U.S. by 2020.&lt;ref name="blog.trendstop.com"/&gt; Furthermore, analysts at Morgan Stanley, believe that global sales may therefore rise to over $350 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2016/10/06/the-athleisure-trend-is-here-to-stay/#565def428bd4.|title=The Athleisure Trend Is Here To Stay|last=Speculations|first=Great|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of this, there is an arising issue regarding market saturation, due to the continuous entry of traditional luxury, and mass merchant brands, tapping into this trend.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The athleisure market for casual athletic clothing, which took off a few years ago, also has become increasingly crowded with big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target, as well as fast-fashion brands joining the fray—often at cheaper prices.&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday3" /&gt; An analyst estimated that the athleisure market was not slowing down, with much competition and pressure on various retail outlets including sporting goods stores.&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday3" /&gt; Therefore, the best performing brands have proven their ability to withstand the emerging competition, as they sell clothes and a lifestyle as a package.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Global shifts toward a rise in health and fitness trends has led to growing interest and participation in sports among the public. Many have actively joined clubs and competitions in order to fully adopt the characteristics of this lifestyle. Consequently, sportswear brands can utilize this opportunity to improve and introduce better quality apparel, footwear, and gear. By presenting their devotion towards a lifestyle, it thus allows brands to garner customer loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jefffromm/2016/07/06/the-lululemon-lifestyle-millennials-seek-more-than-just-comfort-from-athleisure-wear/#42fb221714d9|title=The Lululemon Lifestyle: Millennials Seek More Than Just Comfort From Athleisure Wear|last=Fromm|first=Jeff|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{EarlyBuddhism}}
'''Bhāṇakas''' ([[Pali language|Pali]]: '''reciter''') were [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] who specialized in the memorization and recitation of a specific collection of texts within the [[Tripitaka|Buddhist canon]]. Lineages of bhāṇakas were responsible for preserving and transmitting the teachings of the Buddha until the canon was committed to writing in the 1st Century BC, and declined as the oral transmission of early Buddhism was replaced by writing.

==Early Buddhist era==
Academic consensus and Buddhist tradition holds that all early Buddhist traditions preserved their texts via [[oral transmission]]- significant evidence of this includes the structure and distinctive features of early Buddhist texts, the absence of [[Vinaya]] regulations dealing with writing and writing materials, and terms derived from practices of listening and recitation used to describe the Buddha's teaching and the acts of the early [[Sangha]].&lt;ref name=Norman2/&gt; 

The bhāṇaka system is believed to have originated in India, but the majority of the literary and inscriptional evidence relating to bhāṇakas comes from [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=Deegalle/&gt; Scholars suspect that the same techniques were used by the monks of all [[early Buddhist schools]] to fix and transmit the contents of the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]], but outside of the [[Theravada]] tradition little information about the pre-literary period of these traditions is available.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt; The earliest evidence for the association of monks known as bhāṇaka with knowledge and recitation of specific parts of the Buddhist canon dates to the 2nd or 3rd Century BCE.&lt;ref name=Deegalle/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norman2/&gt;

All schools of Buddhism agree that shortly after the death of the [[Buddha]], a council of his senior students was held to clarify and record his teachings.&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;{{cite book

Once the council had agreed on the contents of the teachings, they acknowledged their acceptance of the sutras by reciting them together.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt; 

Subsequent major and minor [[Buddhist Councils|councils]] are depicted as following the same basic procedure to compare, correct, and fix the contents of the canon, with specialists in each area of the collection called upon to recite the complete text for confirmation by the gathered Sangha.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt;

== Theravada tradition ==
Buddhaghosa reported that according to the oral tradition of the [[Mahavihara]], each of the four Nikayas were entrusted to an individual elder of the early [[Sangha]] and their students for preservation.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt; [[Ananda]] was given responsibility for the [[Digha Nikaya]], [[Sariputta]] for the [[Majjhima Nikaya]], [[Mahakassapa]] for the [[Samyutta Nikaya]], and [[Anuruddha]] for the [[Anguttara Nikaya]].&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt;

Scholars doubt that the sutras and four Nikayas were established in their final form this early, with [[K.R. Norman]] suggesting that this story may be a reflection of later practices.&lt;ref name=Norman2/&gt; Some texts of the Theravada [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]] and Khuddaka Nikaya clearly originate after the First Council, but Theravadins have generally regarded portions of the Abhidhamma as being included at this stage as part of the dhamma/suttas.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt; Texts known to have relatively late origins (after the Third Council) are included in the Theravada accounts of the First Council.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norman2/&gt; Texts that did not fit into any of the four Nikayas were assigned to the Khuddaka (which included the Abhidhamma in some traditions).&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt;

In the [[Theravada]] commentaries, references are found to bhāṇakas that specialized in each of the four Nikayas, as well as [[Jataka]]-bhāṇakas, [[Dhammapada]]-bhāṇakas, and [[Khuddaka Nikaya|Khuddaka]]-bhāṇakas.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt; Each group of bhāṇakas was responsible for reciting and teaching their texts, and seem to have exercised independent judgement as to how their texts were organized and the versions of stories and doctrines that they preserved- variant readings between versions of content preserved in both the [[Digha Nikaya]] and [[Majjhima Nikaya]], for instance, may be attributable to the preservation of different versions by different schools of bhāṇakas.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt; Different schools of bhāṇakas may have 'closed' their canon at different times, and seem to have differed in some cases in which texts of the Khuddaka Nikaya and [[Abhidharma Pitaka]] they accepted as canonical.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt; 

[[Stupa]] inscriptions from India dating to the 2nd Century BCE mention bhāṇakas who specialized in teaching the sutras or knew the four Nikayas/Agamas but do not represent them as specializing in a single Nikaya.&lt;ref name=Deegalle&gt;

KR Norman suggests that the Theravada practice of organizing bhāṇakas by Nikaya may not have originated until after the [[Second Buddhist Council]].&lt;ref name=Norman2/&gt; The [[Dipavamsa]] mentions a 'nine-fold' organization of the early texts being divided into individual chapters at the First Council, which may reflect an earlier method of organization.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt;

References to ''abhidhammikas'' (specialists in the Abhidhamma) but not to Abhidhamma-bhāṇakas in the [[Milindapanha]] may suggest that the bhāṇaka system originated before the Abhidhamma Pitaka was 'closed' by the Theravadins (dated by them to the era of [[Ashoka]] at the [[Third Buddhist Council]]) but, since the Abhidhamma may have been recited by some variety of sutta-bhāṇaka, could also indicate that being a specialist in a branch of texts was distinct from being responsible for its recitation.&lt;ref name=Norman2/&gt;

== Decline ==
No fixed date has been established for the end of the bhāṇaka tradition, but scholars generally believe that the tradition went into decline as the Buddhist canon increasingly began to be preserved through written texts.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Deegalle/&gt; Buddhaghosa wrote about the bhāṇakas as though they were contemporary in approximately the 5th Century CE, but may have been reflecting the perspective of the earlier Sinhala commentaries- his remarks don't definitively establish that the bhāṇaka practice persisted into his own era.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Deegalle/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norman2&gt;{{cite book

The [[Culavamsa]] refers to a bhāṇaka as late as the 13th Century CE, but by this date the term may have become generic for a preacher or specialist in recitation, rather than a monk who preserved a significant portion of the canon by memory.&lt;ref name=Deegalle/&gt;

''' Bilingual interactive activation plus''' ('''BIA+''') is a model for understanding the process of [[bilingual]] language comprehension and consists of two interactive subsystems: the word identification subsystem and task/decision subsystem.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;van Heuven, W.J.B., Dijkstra, T., 2010. Language comprehension in the bilingual brain: fMRI and ERP support for psycholinguistic models. Brain Research Reviews 64, 104–122&lt;/ref&gt; It is the successor of the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA) model &lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, T., Van Heuven, W.J.B., &amp; Grainger, J. (1998). Simulating cross-language competition with the bilingual interactive activation model. Psychologica Belgica, 38, 177–196.&lt;/ref&gt; which was updated in 2002 to include [[phonologic]] and [[semantic]] [[lexicon|lexical]] representations, revise the role of language nodes, and specify the purely bottom-up nature of bilingual language processing.

== Overview ==
The BIA+ is one of many models that was defined based on data from [[psycholinguistic]] or [[behavioral]] studies which investigate how the languages of bilinguals are manipulated during listening, reading and speaking each of them; however, BIA+ is now being supported by [[neuroimaging]] data linking this model to more neurally inspired ones which have a greater focus on the brain areas and mechanisms involved in these tasks.

The two basic tools in these studies are the [[event-related potential]] (ERP) which has high [[temporal resolution]] but low [[spatial resolution]] and the [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) which typically has high spatial resolution and low temporal resolution. When used together, however, these two methods can generate a more complete picture of the time course and interactivity of bilingual language processing according to the BIA+ model.&lt;ref name=review/&gt; These methods, however, do need to be considered carefully as overlapping activation areas in the brain do not imply that there is no functional separation between the two languages at the neuronal or higher-order level.&lt;ref name="hernandez2005 "&gt;Hernandez, A., Li, P., MacWhinney, B., 2005.

===Distinction of 2 subsystems: word identification vs. task/decision ===
	According to the BIA+ model shown in the figure, during word identification, the visual input activates the sublexical [[orthography|orthographic]] representations which simultaneously activate both the orthographic whole-word lexical and the sublexical [[phonological]] representations. Both whole-word orthographic and phonological representations then activate the semantic representations and language nodes which indicate membership to a particular language. All of this information is then used in the task/decision subsystem to carry out the remainder of the task at hand. The two subsystems are further described by the assumptions associated with them below.

==== ''Word identification subsystem'' ====

===== ''Integrated lexicon'' =====
	The integrated lexicon assumption describes the interactivity of the visual representation of word or word parts and [[orthography]], the [[phonologic]] or auditory component of language processing, and the [[semantic]] or significance and meaning representations of words.&lt;ref name="briellmann"&gt;Briellmann, R.S., Saling, M.M., Connell, A.B., Waites, A.B., Abbott, D.F., Jackson G.D., 2004. A high-field functional MRI study of the quadric-lingual subjects. Brain Land. 89, 531–542&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was tested with orthographic neighbors, words of the same length that differ by one letter only (e.g. BALL and FALL). The number of target and non-target language neighbors influenced target word processing in both the primary language (L1) and the secondary language (L2).&lt;ref&gt;van Heuven, W.J.B., Dijkstra, T., Grainger, J., 1998. Orthographic neighborhood effects in bilingual word recognition. Journal of Memory and Language 39, 458–483&lt;/ref&gt; This cross-language neighborhood effect was supposed to reflect a co-activation of words whatever the language they belong to, that is a lexical access that is language nonselective. Both target and nontarget languages can be automatically and unconsciously activated even in a pure monolingual mode. This does not imply, however, that there may not be features unique to one language (i.e. the use of different alphabets) or that, at the semantic level, there are no shared features.

===== ''Language nodes/tags'' =====
	This assumption states that language nodes/tags exist to provide a representation for the language of membership based on the information from upstream orthographic and phonological word ID processes. According to the BIA+ model, these tags have no effect on the activation level representation of words.&lt;ref name=review/&gt; The focus of activation of these nodes is postlexical: the existence of these nodes enables bilingual individuals not to get too much interference from the nontarget language while they process one of their language.

===== ''Nonselective/Parallel access'' =====
	Parallel access assumes that language is nonselective and that both potential word choices are activated in the bilingual brain when exposed to the same stimulus. For example, test subjects reading in their second language have been found to [[unconsciously]] translate to their primary language.&lt;ref name="Thierry2007"&gt;Thierry, G., Wu, Y.J., 2007. Brain potential reveal unconscious translation during foreign-language comprehension. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. U.S.A. 104, 12530-12535&lt;/ref&gt; [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] stimulus response activation measurements show that semantic [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] effects were seen in both languages and an individual cannot consciously focus their attention to only one language, even when told to ignore the second.&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;Martin, C.D., Dering, B., Thomas, E.M., Thierry, G., 2009. Brain potentials reveal semantic priming in both the 'active' and the 'non-attended' language in early bilinguals. NeuroImage 47, 326–333&lt;/ref&gt;
This language nonselective lexical access has been shown during semantic activation across languages, but also at the orthographic and phonological levels.

===== ''Temporal delay of L2'' =====
	The temporal delay assumption is based on the principle of [[resting potential]] activation which reflects the frequency of word use by the bilingual such that high frequency words correlate to high resting level activation potentials, and words used with little frequency correlate to low resting level activation potentials. A high resting potential is one that is less negative or closer to zero, the point of activation, and therefore needs less stimuli in order to become activated. Because the less commonly used words of L2 have a lower resting level activation, L1 is likely to be activated before L2 as seen by N400 ERP patterns.&lt;ref name="moreno2005"&gt;Moreno, E.M., Kutas, M., 2009. Processing semantic anomalie in two languages: an electrophysiological exploration in both language of Spanish-English bilinguals. Cognitive Brain Research 22, 205–220&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
	This resting level activation of words also reflects the proficiency level of bilinguals and their frequency of usage of the two languages. When a bilingual’s [[language proficiency]] is lower in L2 than L1, the activation of L2 lexical representations will be further delayed as more extensive or higher-level brain activation is necessary for language control.&lt;ref name=briellmann/&gt; Both low and high proficiency bilinguals have parallel activation of the word representations, however the less proficient language, L2, becomes active more slowly contributing to the temporal delay assumption.

===== Word identification localization in the brain =====
	The locations of many of the word identification processing tasks have been determined with fMRI studies. Word retrieval is localized in [[Broca's area]] of the [[prefrontal cortex]],&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;Thompson-Schill, S.L., D'Esposito, M., Aguirre, G.K., Farah, M.J., 1997. Role of the left inferior parietal cortex in retrieval of semantic knowledge: a reevaluation. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America  94, 14792-14797&lt;/ref&gt; whereas storage of information is localized in the inferior [[temporal lobes]].
Globally, the same brain areas have been shown to be activated across the L1 and L2 in highly proficient bilinguals. Some subtle differences between L1 and L2 activations emerge though when testing lower proficient bilinguals.

==== ''Task/decision subsystem'' ====
	The task/decision subsystem of the BIA+ model determines which actions must be executed for the task at hand based on the relevant information that becomes available after word identification processing.&lt;ref name=review/&gt; This subsystem involves many of the executive processes including monitoring and control associated with the [[prefrontal cortex]].

===== ''Bottom-up control of task/decision from word identification'' =====
	Action plans that meet the task at hand are executed by the task/decision system on the basis of activation information from the word identification subsystem.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; Studies that tested bilinguals with [[homographs]] showed that conflicts between target and non-target language readings of the homographs still led to a difference in activation between it and a control, implying that bilinguals are not able to regulate activation in the word identification system.&lt;ref name="vanHeuven2008"&gt;van Heuven, W.J.B., Schriefers, H., Dijkstra, T. Hagoort, P., 2008. Language conflicts in the bilingual brain. Cerebral Cortex 18, 458–483&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the action plans of the task/decision system have no direct influence on activations of word identification language subsystem.

===== Task/decision localization in the brain =====
	The neural correlates of the task/ decision subsystem consist of multiple components that map onto different areas of prefrontal cortex responsible for executing control functions. For example, the general executive functions of language switching have been found to activate the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] areas.,&lt;ref name="hernandez2009"&gt;Hernandez, A.E. 2009. Language switching in the bilingual brain: what’s next?. Brain and Language 109, 133–140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="price1999"&gt;Price, C.J., Green, D.W., von Studnitz, R.1999. A functional imaging study of translation and language switching. Brain 122, 2221–2235&lt;/ref&gt;
	
	Translation, on the other hand, requires controlled actions in language representations and has been associated with the left [[basal ganglia]],&lt;ref name=price1999/&gt;&lt;ref name="lehtonen"&gt;Lehtonen, M.H., Laine, M., Niemi, J., Thomsen, T., Vorobyev, V.A., Hugdhal, K., 2005. Brain correlates of sentence translation in Finnish-Norwegian bilinguals. NeuroReport 16, 607–610&lt;/ref&gt; The left [[caudate nucleus]] has been associated with control of in-use language,&lt;ref&gt;Crinion, J., Turner, R., Grogan, A., Hanakawa, T., Noppeney, U., Devlin, J.T., et al, 2006. Language control in the bilingual brain. Science 312, 1537–1540&lt;/ref&gt; and the left mid-[[prefrontal cortex]] is responsible for monitoring interference and suppressing competing responses between languages.,&lt;ref name=lehtonen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodriquez-Fornells, A., van der Lugt, A., Rotte, M., Britti, B., Heinze, H.J., Munte, T.F., 2005. Second language interferes with word production in fluent bilinguals: brain potential and functional imaging evidence. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 17, 422–433&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
	According to the BIA+ model, when a bilingual with English as their primary language and Spanish as their secondary language translates the word ''advertencia'' from Spanish to English, several steps occur. The bilingual would use the orthographic and phonological cues to differentiate this word from the similar English word ''advertisement''. At this point, however, the bilingual automatically derives the semantic meaning of the word, not only for the correct Spanish meaning of advertencia which is ''warning'' but also for the Spanish meaning of advertisement which is ''publicidad''.

	This information would then be stored in the bilingual’s [[working memory]] and used in the task/decision system to determine which of the two translations best fits the task at hand. Since the original instructions were to translate from Spanish to English, the bilingual would choose the correct translation of ''advertencia'' to be ''warning'' and not ''advertisement''.

== Differences between BIA+ and BIA precursor ==
	While the BIA+ models shares several similarities with its predecessor, the BIA model, there are a few distinct differences that exist between the two. First and most notable is the purely bottom-up nature of the BIA+ model which assumes that information from the task/decision subsystem cannot influence the word identification subsystem, while the BIA model assumes that the two systems can fully interact.

	Second is that the language membership nodes of the BIA+ model do not affect the activation levels of the word identification system, whereas they play an [[inhibitory]] role in the BIA model. 	

	Finally participant expectations could potentially affect the task/decision system in the BIA+ model; however the BIA model assumes there is no strong effect on the activation state of words based on expectations.&lt;ref name=review/&gt;

== Future ==
The BIA+ model has been supported by many of the quantitative [[neuroimaging]] studies but more research needs to be completed in order to strengthen the model as a frontrunner in the accepted models for bilingual language processing. In the task/decision system, the task components are well-defined (e.g. translation, language switching) but the decision components involved in the execution of these tasks in the subsystem are underspecified. The relationship of the components in this subsystem need further exploration in order to be fully understood.

Scientists are also considering the use of [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG) in future studies. This technology would link the spatial activation processes with the temporal patterns of brain response more accurately than simultaneously considering the response data from ERP and fMRI which are more limited.

Not only have studies suggested that the executive functioning of bilingualism extends beyond the language system, but bilinguals have also been shown to be faster processors who display fewer conflict effects than monolinguals in attentional tasks&lt;ref&gt;Costa, A., Hernandez, M., Sebastian-Galles, N., 2008. Bilingualism aids conflict resolution: evidence from the ANT task. Cognition 106, 59–86&lt;/ref&gt; This research implies that there may be some spillover effects of learning a second language on other areas of cognitive function that could be explored.

One future direction theories on [[bilingual word recognition]] should take is the investigation of developmental aspects of [[bilingual lexical access]].&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, J., Midgley, K., &amp; Holcomb, P.J. (2010). Re-thinking the bilingual interactive-activation model from a developmental perspective (BIA-d). In M. Kail &amp; M. Hickmann (Eds.), Language Acquisition across Linguistic and Cognitive Systems. New York: John Benjamins (pp. 267–284).&lt;/ref&gt; Most studies have investigated highly proficient bilinguals, but not many have looked at low-proficient bilinguals or even L2 learners. This new direction should prove to bring a lot of educational applications.

'''Bislama''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|b|ɪ|s|l|ə|m|ɑː|}};&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-all|bislaˈma|Bislama:}}; also known under its earlier name in French {{lang|fr|bichelamar}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/bis Bislama], Ethnologue.  Accessed Jan. 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|biʃlamaʁ|}}) is a [[creole language]], one of the official languages of [[Vanuatu]].  It is the first language of many of the "Urban [[ni-Vanuatu]]" (those who live in [[Port Vila]] and [[Luganville]]), and the second language of much of the rest of the country's residents. "[[Yumi, Yumi, Yumi]]", the Vanuatu national anthem, is in Bislama.

More than 95% of Bislama words are of English origin; the remainder combines a few dozen words from French, as well as some vocabulary inherited from various [[languages of Vanuatu]], essentially limited to flora and fauna terminology.&lt;ref&gt;See Charpentier (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; While the influence of these vernacular languages is low on the vocabulary side, it is very high in the morphosyntax. Bislama can be basically described as a language with an English vocabulary and an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] grammar and phonology.&lt;ref&gt;See Camden (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the period of "[[blackbirding]]", in the 1870s and 1880s, hundreds of thousands of Pacific islanders (many of them from the [[New Hebrides]] – now the [[Vanuatu]]  archipelago) were taken as indentured labourers or sometimes kidnapped and forced to work on plantations, mainly in [[Queensland, Australia]] and [[Fiji]].&lt;ref&gt;Emma Christopher, Cassandra Pybus and Marcus Buford Rediker (2007). ''Many Middle Passages: Forced Migration and the Making of the Modern World'', University of California Press, pp 188–190. {{ISBN|0-520-25206-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With several languages being spoken in these plantations, a [[pidgin]] was formed, combining English vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;In addition, whaling captains who picked up workforce from Africa and the Pacific Islands had already developed some sort of pidginized English. Modern Bislama bears a striking resemblance to Pidgin Englishes of West Africa{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (where the slave trade was also active at one time); it is possible that Bislama is one branch of an evolution of pidgins from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} when the first truly global trading system began. See [[Monogenetic theory of pidgins]].&lt;/ref&gt; with grammatical structures typical of languages in the region.&lt;ref&gt;For this whole section, see: Tryon &amp; Charpentier (2004), and Crowley (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; This early plantation pidgin is the origin not only of Bislama, but also of [[Tok Pisin]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Pijin]] of the [[Solomon Islands]], though not of [[Torres Strait Creole]] north of Australia.

This pidgin started spreading over the Vanuatu archipelago at the turn of the 20th century, as the survivors of blackbirding began to come back to their native islands: knowledge of this pidgin would facilitate communication not only with European traders and settlers, but also between native populations, and because Vanuatu is the most language-dense country in the world (one count puts it at [[Languages of Vanuatu|113 languages]] for a population of 225,000),&lt;ref&gt;See Crowley ([[#TC-situation|2000]]:50); François ([[#AF-diversity|2012]]:86).&lt;/ref&gt; Bislama usefully serves as a [[lingua franca]] for communication between ni-Vanuatu, as well as with and even between foreigners. Although it has been a spoken-only language for most of its history, in 1995, has the first dictionary of Bislama been published.&lt;ref&gt;See Crowley ([[#TC-dict|1995]]).&lt;/ref&gt; This, along with its second edition in 2004 has helped to create a uniform spelling of written Bislama.

Besides Bislama, most ni-Vanuatu also know their local language, the local language of their father and that of their mother, and their spouse – and formal schools are taught in English or in French.

===Name===
The name of Bislama (also referred to, especially in French, as "Bichelamar") comes via the early 19th century word "Beach-la-Mar" from pseudo-French "biche de mer" or "bêche de mer", [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]], which itself comes from an alteration of the Portuguese "bicho do mar".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=B%C3%AACHE-DE-MER bêche-de-mer]", [[American Heritage Dictionary]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1840s, sea cucumbers were also harvested and dried at the same time that [[sandalwood]] was gathered. The names ''biche-la-mar'' and 'Sandalwood English' came to be associated with the kind of pidgin that came to be used by the local laborers between themselves, as well as their English-speaking overseers.&lt;ref&gt;See Crowley (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Louis Stevenson]] wrote in an account of his travels through the Pacific in 1888 and 1889, "the natives themselves have often scraped up a little English&amp;nbsp;... or an efficient pidgin, what is called to the westward 'Beach-la-Mar'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevenson|first=Robert Louis|title=In the South Seas|year=2004|publisher=1st World Publishing|location=Fairfield, IA|isbn=1-59540-504-6|pages=15|url=http://www.1stworldlibrary.org|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jack London]]'s story "Yah! Yah! Yah!", one of his "[[South Sea Tales (1911)|South Sea Tales]]", there is repeated a reference to "a bastard lingo called ''bech-de-mer''", and much of the story's dialogue is conducted in it.

Today, the word "bislama" itself is seldom used by younger speakers of Bislama to refer to sea slugs, as a new re-borrowing from pseudo-French "bêche de mer", which has taken the form "besdemea", has become more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Terry|title=Beach-la-Mar to Bislama: The Emergence of a National Language in Vanuatu|year=1990|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=33|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
Its alphabet uses A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, [[Velar nasal|digraph NG]], O, P, R, S, T, U, V, W, and Y; along with the ''AE'' and ''AO''.

Before 1995, an older orthography had an ''É'', (now written E); ''AI'' and ''AU'' instead of ''AE'' and ''AO''. For hiatus, ''AÏ'' and ''AÜ'' (now written ''AI'' and ''AU'') were used, and ''M̄'' was used for {{IPA|/mʷ/}}, and ''P̄'' for {{IPA|/pʷ/}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://eki.ee/letter/chardata.cgi?lang=bi+Bislama&amp;script=latin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eki.ee/letter/chardata.cgi?lang=bi+Bislama&amp;script=latin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/54584756/FULL_TEXT.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; – the orthography after 1995 has no diacritics and writes these sounds as  ''MW'' and ''PW''.

==Grammar==
Two frequent words in Bislama are "long" and "blong", which take the place of many prepositions in English or French.

==="Long"===
*''Long'' as 'next to', 'by', 'beside' etc.
*;Stoa long haos: The store next to the house.
*''long'' as 'at' or 'to'
*;Mi bin stap long ples ia bifo: I have been to this place before.
*;Mi stap long stoa: I am at the store.
*''long'' as 'in'
*;Jea long haos: The chair in the house.

''Long'' holds many other related meanings, and is sometimes used in improvisation.

==="Blong"===
Originally from the English word "belong", ''blong'' takes the place of 'of' or the genitive case in other languages. Just like ''of'' in English, it is one of the most widely used and versatile words in the language, and can indicate possession, country of origin, defining characteristics, intention, and others.

;Buk blong mi: The book that belongs to me, my book
;Man blong Amerika: Man from America, American.
;Hemi woman blong saiens: She is a woman of science, She is a scientist.
;Man blong dring: Man of drinking i.e. a drinker

===Verbs===
Verbs in Bislama usually consist of a stem word (borrowed from English, French or indigenous languages); most [[transitive verb]]s add to this a transitive suffix.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of transitive verbs which exceptionally don't take this suffix include: ''kakae'' 'eat, bite'; ''trink'' 'drink'; ''save'' 'know'; ''se'' 'say'.&lt;/ref&gt;
The form of that suffix is /-em/, /-im/, or /-um/, depending on [[vowel harmony]]. If the last vowel of the verb's stem is either -u- or -i-, then that vowel will be copied into the transitive suffix. For all other stem vowels, the transitive suffix has its default form /-em/:

Verbs do not conjugate. The [[tense, aspect and mood]] of a sentence are indicated with markers such as ''stap'', ''bin'' and ''bae'' that are placed in the sentence.

;Mi '''stap''' kakae taro: I'm eating taro
;Mi '''bin''' kakae taro: I have eaten taro
;'''Bae''' mi kakae taro: I will eat taro

===Nouns===
The plural is formed by putting ''ol'' before the word. For example, ''bia'' 'beer'; ''ol bia'' = "beers". ''Ol'' comes from the English "all". When used with numbers, the singular form is used. 2 bia, 3 bia, etc.

===Pronouns===
The [[personal pronoun]]s of Bislama feature four grammatical numbers (singular, dual, trial and plural). They also encode the [[clusivity]] distinction: 1st person non-singular pronouns (equivalent of English ''we'') are described as ''inclusive'' if they include the addressee (i.e. {you + I}, {you + I + others}), but ''exclusive'' otherwise (i.e. {I + other people}). Bislama pronouns do not [[Grammatical case|decline]].

===Tense/aspect/mood markers===
*'''stap''' + V : ([[Progressive aspect|progressive]]) ongoing or habitual action
*;hem i stap kukum kumala: he/she is cooking sweet potatoes
*'''bin''' + V : [[past tense]]  (with implication that the state is no longer true)
*;hemi bin sik long fiva: she was sick with fever [but is no longer sick]
*V + '''finis''' : ([[Perfective aspect|perfective]]) "already" (when placed at the end of a phrase; elsewhere it means "finish")
*;hem i kakae finis: she has already eaten
*'''bae''' + V (occasionally '''bambae'''): ([[irrealis]]) future or hypothetical actions (though, like in English, generally not used in [[conditional sentences]])
*;bae mi go long Santo: I will go to Santo
*;sipos plen i no bin fulap, bae mi go long Santo: If the plane hadn't been full, I would have gone to Santo
*'''no''' + V : negative, "not"
*;hem i no wantem yam: he doesn't want yam
*'''nomo''' + V: "no longer" (when placed after the predicate; elsewhere it means "only")
*;hem i nomo kakae yam: he no longer eats yam
*;hem i kakae yam nomo: he only eats yam
*'''neva''' + V : never
*;hem i neva kakae yam: he's never eaten yam
*'''jes''' + V : (&lt;"just") an action that has recently occurred
*;mifala i jes wekap: we just woke up
*In a future context, ''jes'' entails a delay, rendered in English as "eventually":
*;bae mi pem: I will buy it / Let me buy it
*;bae mi jes pem, be noyet: I will buy it (eventually), but not yet
*V + '''gogo''' : continued action
*;hemi kukum kumala gogo: he keeps on cooking sweet potatoes
*'''mas''' + V : "must", be obliged to
*;hem i mas kakae: he must eat
*'''traem''' + V : "try to"; also sometimes used for politeness in requests
*;hem i stap traem katem: he's trying to cut it
*;traem soem long mi: could you show it me? (request)
*'''wantem''' + V :  "want to"
*;hem i wantem go long Santo: she wants to go to Santo
*'''save''' + V : be able to, or be in the habit of doing
*;mi save rid: I can read
*;mi no save dring suga: I don't take sugar in drinks
*;fish ia i save kilim man: this fish can kill a person

Some of these markers also have lexical meanings. For example, ''save'' can mean "be able to" but it is also a verb "know".

==Subordination==
*'''sapos''' + Clause :  if
;sapos yumitu faenem pig, bae yumitu kilim i ded: if we find a pig, we'll kill it

==Internal variation==
Dialects exist, based mainly on different pronunciations in different areas which stem from the different sounds of the native languages. The future tense marker can be heard to be said as: Bambae, Mbae, Nambae, or Bae. There are also preferences for using Bislama or native words that vary from place to place, and most people insert English, French, or local language words to fill out Bislama. So in the capital city it is common to hear 'computer'; in other places you might hear 'ordinateur'.

A '''burr''' is a raised edge or small piece of material remaining attached to a workpiece after a modification process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillespie|1999|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usually an unwanted piece of material and is removed with a '''deburring tool''' in a process called 'deburring'. Burrs are most commonly created by [[machining]] operations, such as [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], [[drilling]], [[Milling machine|milling]], [[engraving]] or [[turning]]. It may be present in the form of a fine wire on the edge of a freshly sharpened tool or as a raised portion of a surface; this type of burr is commonly formed when a [[hammer]] strikes a surface. Deburring accounts for a significant portion of manufacturing costs.

In the [[printmaking]] technique of [[drypoint]], burr, which gives a rich fuzzy quality to the engraved line, is highly desirable—the great problem with the drypoint medium is that the burr rapidly diminishes after as few as ten impressions are printed.

==Types==
There are three types of burrs that can be formed from machining operations: ''Poisson burr'', ''rollover burr'', and ''breakout burr''. The rollover burr is the most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stephenson | first = David A. | last2 = Agapiou | first2 = John S. | title = Metal cutting theory and practice | page = 435 | publisher = Marcel Dekker | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=19AdVu1O4fQC&amp;lpg=PA435 | isbn = 978-0-8247-9579-5 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrs may be classified by the physical manner of formation. Plastic deformation of material includes lateral flow (Poisson burr), bending (rollover burr), and tearing of material from the workpiece (tear burr). Solidification or redeposition of material results in a recast bead. Incomplete cutoff of material causes a cutoff projection.&lt;ref name="tmeh"&gt;Tool and Manufacturing Engineers Handbook (TMEH), Volume 3, Materials, Finishing and Coating. Society of Manufacturing Engineers, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrs can be minimized or prevented by considering materials, function, shape, and processing in the design and manufacturing engineering phases of product development.&lt;ref name="tmeh"/&gt;

Burrs in drilled holes cause fastener and material problems. Burrs cause more stress to be concentrated at the edges of holes, decreasing resistance to fracture and shortening fatigue life. They interfere with the seating of fasteners, causing damage to fastener or the assembly itself. Cracks caused by stress and strain can result in material failure. Burrs in holes also increase the risk of corrosion, which may be due to variations in the thickness of coatings on a rougher surface. Sharp corners tend to concentrate electrical charge, increasing the risk of static discharge. Burrs in moving parts increase unwanted friction and heat. Rough surfaces also result in problems with lubrication, as wear is increased at the interfaces of parts. This makes it necessary to replace them more frequently. Electrical charge buildup can cause corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, David. "Surface Condition Impacts Part Performance," ''Metal Finishing'', February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deburring==
[[File:Deburring tool.jpg|thumb|upright|60px|A manual deburring tool]]

There are many deburring processes, but the most common are [[mass-finishing]], [[spindle finishing]], [[media blasting]], [[sanding]], [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], [[wire brushing]], [[abrasive flow machining]], electrochemical deburring, [[electropolishing]], thermal energy method, [[machining]], and manual deburring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillespie|1999|pp=7–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manual deburring===
''Manual deburring'' is the most common deburring process because it is the most flexible process. It also only requires low cost tools and allows for instant inspection.&lt;ref name="gillespie11"&gt;{{harvnb|Gillespie|1999|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Manual deburring is either done with tools like scrapers, files, sandpaper, stones and reamers or with handheld power tools that use abrasive points, sandpaper, or cutters similar to those used to deburr during machining.

===Electrochemical deburring===
''Electrochemical deburring'' is the use of [[electrochemical machining]] to deburr precision work pieces and edges that are hard-to-reach, such as intersecting holes. The process uses a salt or [[glycol]] solution and electricity to dissolve the burr. The electric current is applied with a specialized tool to reach the burr location. Burrs are removed in 5 to 10 seconds, while the rest of the work piece is unaffected.&lt;ref name="gillespie11"/&gt;

===Thermal energy method===
''Thermal energy method'' (TEM), also known as ''thermal deburring'', is a deburring process used to remove hard-to-reach burrs or burrs from multiple surfaces at the same time. The process uses an explosive gas mixture to provide thermal energy to burn off the burrs. It is the fastest burr removal process, requiring only 20 milliseconds to remove a burr.&lt;ref name="benedict"&gt;{{Citation | last = Benedict | first = Gary F. | title = Nontraditional manufacturing processes | pages = 349–350 | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1987 | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=xdmNVSio8jUC&amp;pg=PA349 | isbn = 978-0-8247-7352-6 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process starts by loading the workpiece into an [[explosion-proof]] chamber, which is then sealed and clamped with approximately {{convert|220|metric ton|short ton|abbr=on}}. The chamber is then evacuated of air and filled with an oxygen and fuel mix; this mixture is pressurized to {{convert|0.5|to|1.9|MPa|abbr=on}}. An electrical igniter then ignites the mixture, which burns for approximately 20 milliseconds, causing all of the sharp corners and burrs to burn away. The peak temperature reaches {{convert|3000|C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="benedict"/&gt;

===Cryogenic deburring===
''Cryogenic deburring'' is a [[cryogenic]] process used to remove burrs and [[flash (manufacturing)|flash]] from [[plastic]] and [[die cast]] workpieces. The process works by tumbling and/or abrasively blasting the workpieces at cryogenic temperature levels. The low temperatures (approximately {{convert|-195|C|abbr=on}}) are achieved using [[liquid nitrogen]], liquid [[carbon dioxide]], or [[dry ice]]. This low temperature brings the material below its [[Embrittlement|embrittlement temperature]], which causes the flash or burrs to be easily removed via tumbling or media blasting. This process has been around since the 1960s to deflash plastic and rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillespie|1999|pp=195–196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Common materials that are typically cryogenically deburred with blast media include PEEK, nylon, Teflon, Delrin, polypropylene, polycarbonate, acetal, PTFE, PET, HDPE, PVC, ABS and many others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nitrofreeze.com/services/deburring/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical deburring===
[[File:Mechanical Deburring Tool.jpg|thumb|A typical example of a 'Burraway' tool, deburring the back of a hole.]]
''Mechanical deburring'' is a deburring process that either mechanically grinds a burr off of metal or rolls the edge of dangerous slit or sheared metal burrs into itself.  Rolled mechanical deburring was first developed in the 1960s by Walter W. Gauer from Gauer Metal Product, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gauermetal.com/products/edging-machines/|title = Gauer Edging Machines|date = |accessdate = |website = Gauer Edging Machines|publisher = |last = Schultz|first = Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a means to speed up the process of hand deburring strips of metal that were used in bakery racks.&lt;ref&gt;Metal Progress, Volume 96&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], the '''canopy''' is the aboveground portion of a [[plant community]] or [[crop]], formed by the collection of individual [[Crown (botany)|plant crowns]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, G.S., and J.M. Norman. 1990. The description and measurement of plant canopy structure. pp. 1-19 In: Russell, G., B. Marshall, and P.G. Jarvis (editors). ''Plant Canopies: Their Growth, Form and Function''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moffett, M.W. 2000. What's ''up''? A critical look at the basic terms of canopy biology. ''Biotropica'' 32:569-596.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hay, R., and R. Porter. 2006 ''Physiology of Crop Yield'' (Second edition). Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|1-4051-0859-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0859-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[forest ecology]], canopy also refers to the upper layer or [[habitat]] zone, formed by mature [[Crown (botany)|tree crowns]] and including other biological organisms ([[epiphytes]], [[lianas]], [[Arboreal|arboreal animals]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Parker, G.G. 1995. Structure and microclimate of forest canopies. pp. 73-106 In: Lowman, M.D. and N.M. Nadkarni (editors). ''Forest Canopies''. Academic Press, San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term canopy is used to refer to the extent of the outer layer of leaves of an individual [[tree]] or group of trees.{{cn|date=October 2015}} [[Shade tree]]s normally have a dense canopy that blocks light from lower growing plants.

== Canopy structure ==
[[File:Monkey Ladder Vine canopy.jpg|thumb|A [[Entada gigas|Monkey Ladder Vine]] canopy over a road]]
Canopy structure is the organization or spatial arrangement (three-dimensional geometry) of a plant canopy. [[Leaf Area Index]] (LAI), leaf area per unit ground area, is a key measure used to understand and compare plant canopies. It is also taller than the understory layer.

== Canopy layer of forests ==

Dominant and co-dominant canopy trees form the uneven canopy layer.  Canopy trees are able to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] relatively rapidly due to abundant light, so it supports the majority of primary productivity in forests.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  The canopy layer provides protection from strong winds and storms, while also intercepting sunlight and precipitation, leading to a relatively sparsely vegetated [[understory]] layer.

Forest canopies are home to unique flora and fauna not found in other layers of forests.  The highest terrestrial [[biodiversity]] resides in the canopy of [[tropical rainforest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowman, M.D. and M.W. Moffett. 1993. The ecology of tropical rain forest canopies. ''Trees'' 8:104-107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many rainforest animals have evolved to live solely in the canopy, and never touch the ground.

The canopy of a [[rainforest]] is typically about 10m thick, and intercepts around 95% of sunlight.&lt;ref name=Garden.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Light in the Rain Forest|url=http://assoc.garden.org/courseweb/course1/week4/page5a.htm|website=garden.org|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The canopy is below the [[Rainforest#Layers|emergent layer]], a sparse layer of very tall trees, typically one or two per [[hectare]].  With an abundance of water and a near ideal temperature in rainforests, light and nutrients are two factors that limit tree growth from the understory to the canopy.

In the [[permaculture]] and [[forest gardening]] community, the canopy is the highest of seven layers.

'''Central Bavarian''', also known as '''Central Austro-Bavarian''', form a subgroup of [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] dialects in large parts of [[Austria]] and the German state of [[Bavaria]] along the [[Danube]] river, on the northern side of the [[Eastern Alps]]. They are spoken in the '[[Altbayern|Old Bavarian]]' regions of [[Upper Bavaria]] (with [[Munich]]), [[Lower Bavaria]] and in the adjacent parts of the [[Upper Palatinate]] region around [[Regensburg]], in [[Upper Austria|Upper]] and [[Lower Austria]], in [[Vienna]] (see [[Viennese German]]), in the state of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], as well as in the northern and eastern parts of [[Styria]] and [[Burgenland]].

==Differences==
There are noticeable differences in the language within the group, but changes occur along a west-east [[dialect continuum]] on both sides of the historic border of the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] stem duchy with the later [[Duchy of Austria]]. That means that the distinct languages of Vienna and Munich are very different from each other, but the dialects of any two neighboring towns in between will be quite similar. However, due to influences of the corresponding political centers, discontinuous change is nowadays noticeable along the national border between [[Austria]] and [[Germany]].
Generally, Viennese has some characteristics differentiating it from other Bavarian dialects due to the influence of languages spoken by people moving to Vienna from many areas of [[Austria-Hungary]] during the 19th century.

==Characteristics==
A characteristic of Central Bavarian is the vocalization of ''l'' and ''r'' after ''e'' or ''i''. E.g. the standard German ''viel'' becomes either ''vui'' (in Western Central Bavarian) or ''vüü'' (in Eastern Central Bavarian).
The border between the western and eastern subgroups roughly coincides with the border between [[Bavaria]] and [[Austria]]. 

In all subgroups, hard consonants such as ''p, t, k'' are softened to become ''b, d, g''.

The communicative constitution of organizations (CCO) perspective is broadly characterized by the claim that communication is not something that happens within organizations or between organizational members; instead, communication is the process whereby organizations are constituted. Specifically, this view contends: “organization is an effect of communication not its predecessor." &lt;ref name="Blaschke2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lou.econ.uni-hamburg.de/tag/communication-as-constitutive/|title=Building Blocks of Postmodern Organizational Communication|last=Blaschke|first=Steffen|date=13 November 2009|publisher=Universitat Hamburg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112042548/http://lou.econ.uni-hamburg.de/tag/communication-as-constitutive/|archivedate=12 January 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=19 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective is part of a broader constitutive view of communication arguing, "elements of communication, rather than being fixed in advance, are reflexively constituted within the act of communication itself".&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=Robert T.|title=Communication|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~craigr/Communication.htm|work=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric|date=3 September 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220030311/http://spot.colorado.edu/~craigr/Communication.htm|archivedate=20 December 2011|deadurl=yes|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of the perspective==

The model of communication as constitutive of organizations has origins in the linguistic approach to organizational communication taken in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Blaschke"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blaschke|first=Steffen|url=http://lou.econ.uni-hamburg.de/tag/communication-as-constitutive/|title=Building Blocks of Postmodern Organizational Communication|publisher=Universitat Hamburg|date=13 November 2009|accessdate=19 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112042548/http://lou.econ.uni-hamburg.de/tag/communication-as-constitutive/|archivedate=12 January 2015|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Karl E. Weick]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weick|first=Karl|title=The social psychology of organizing|year=1979|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among the first to posit that organizations were not static but inherently comprised by a dynamic process of communicating.

The notion of a communicative constitution of organization comprises three schools of thought:&lt;ref name="Schools"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoeneborn|first=Dennis|author2=Steffen Blaschke|title=The Three Schools of CCO Thinking:Interactive Dialogue and Systematic Comparison.|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|volume=28|issue=2|year=2014|pages=285–316|url=http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/28/2/285.abstract|doi=10.1177/0893318914527000}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) The Montréal School, (2) the McPhee's Four Flows based on Gidden's [[Structuration theory|Structuration Theory]], and (3), Luhmann's Theory of [[Social system|Social Systems]].

==McPhee &amp; Zaug's Four Flows==

In their seminal 2000 article, which was republished in 2009 &lt;ref name="McPheeZaug-21-45"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McPhee|first=Robert D|author2=Pamela Zaug|title=The communicative constitution of organizations: A framework for explanation|journal=Building Theories of Organization: The Constitutive Role of Communication.|year=2000|pages=21–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Communicative Constitution of Organizations: A Framework for Explanation'', Robert D. McPhee and Pamela Zaug distinguish four types of communicative flows generate a social structure through interaction. The flows, though distinct, can affect one another in the model and lead to multi-way conversation or texts typically involving reproduction of as well as resistance to the rules and resources of the organization.

[[File:ConstitutiveRoleofComm.jpg|thumb|Model of the four flows or interaction processes which constitute an organization.]]

=== Organizational self-structuring ===

Reflexive self-structuring separates organizations from other groupings such as a [[crowd]] or mob. The self-structuring process is deliberately carried out through communication among role-holders and groups. Communication regarding self-structuring is recursive and [[dialogic]] in nature. It concerns the control, design, and documentation of an organization's relations, [[Norm (social)|norms]], processes, and entities. Communication of formal structure predetermines work routines rather than allowing them to emerge and controls the collaboration and membership-negotiation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McPhee|first=Robert|title=Organizational communication: Traditional themes and new directions|year=1985|publisher=Sage|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=149–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical examples of organizational self-structuring include a [[charter]], [[organizational chart]], and policy [[Business and company operating manual|manual]].

Organizational self-structuring is a political, subjective process that can be affected by systems, individuals, interests, and traditions in which it takes place.&lt;ref name="McPheeZaug-1-16"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McPhee|first=Robert D|author2=Pamela Zaug|year=2000|title=The communicative constitution of organizations: A framework for explanation|url=http://www.cios.org/EJCPUBLIC/010/1/01017.html|journal=Electronic Journal of Communication/La Revue Electronique de Communication.|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=1–16}} Reprinted in: {{cite book|title=Building Theories of Organization: The Constitutive Role of Communication.|last=Putnam|first=Linda L|author2=Anne M Nicotera|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0805847109|location=New York|pages=21–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not necessarily free of error or ambiguity. To constitute an organization, the communication must imply the formation and governance of a differentiated whole with its own reflexive response cycle and mechanisms.

=== Membership negotiation ===

Organizations are necessarily composed of, yet are distinct from, individual members. Because humans are not inherently members of organizations, negotiatory communication must occur to incorporate them. Membership negotiation links an [[organization]] to its members by establishing and maintaining relationships. Practices in membership negotiation include job [[recruitment]] and socialization.&lt;ref name="McPheeZaug-1-16" /&gt; In recruitment, potential members are evaluated, both parties must agree to a relationship, and the member must be incorporated into the structure of the organization. The negotiation process can be influenced by powers including prior existence and supervision, and all parties involved may redefine themselves to fit expectations. Among higher status members, power-claiming and spokesmanship are examples of negotiation processes to gain resources of an organization.

=== Activity coordination ===

Activity coordination is a result of the fact that organizations inherently have at least one purpose to which the members' activity is contributing. Often an organization's self-structuring defines the division of labor, work flow sequences, policies, etc. that set the course for activity coordination. The structure is reflexively changing and may not be complete, relevant, fully understood, or free of problems. Therefore, a necessity of communication arises among members to amend and adjust the work process. Activity coordination can include adjusting the work process and resolving immediate or unforeseen practical problems.

Activity coordination operates on the assumption that members are working in an interdependent social unit beyond the work tasks themselves. It incorporates any processes and attitudes and therefore includes coordination for members to not complete work or to seek power over one another. The work of [[Henry Mintzberg|Dr. Henry Mintzberg]] exemplifies activity coordination in the mechanism of mutual adjustment in his theory of organizational forms. In this example, co-workers informally coordinate work arounds for issues on the job.

=== Institutional positioning ===

Institutional positioning links the organization to the environment outside the organization at a macro level. Examples of entities outside the organization include suppliers, customers, and competitors. Communication outside the organization negotiates terms of recognition of the organization’s existence and place in what is called "identity negotiation" or "positioning".&lt;ref name="McPheeZaug-1-16" /&gt; Often the communicators of this message are individuals who concurrently negotiate their own relationships but messages can come from the greater organization as a whole.

Though there is not one configuration that an organization must embody, in order to be considered by peer institutions, the minimum process involves negotiating inclusion in the environment. Organizations must establish and maintain a presence, image, status, and a two-way communication channel with partners. Objects such as organizational charts can assert a particular image and demonstrate legitimacy. Organizations which are marginalized due to their lack of institutional positioning include [[startup companies]] and illegal groups such as [[the Mafia]]. Generally, the more secure an organization, the stronger relationships and control over uncertainty and resources it has in its environment. Pre-existing institutional ([[corporations]], agencies), political, legal, cultural, etc. structures allow for easier constitution of complex organizations.

== The Montréal School ==
One of the most distinctive stances of the Montreal School approach, birthed in the Universite de Montreal by James Taylor, Francois Cooren (see particularly Cooren, 2004), and Bruno Latour amongst others, is that texts have agency. Texts do something to humans that is not reducible to certain human interactions and human actions.&lt;ref&gt;Cooren, F. (2004). Textual Agency: How Texts Do Tings in Organizational Settings. Organization, 11, pp. 373-393. DOI 10.1177/1350508404041998&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montreal flavor of CCO is exemplified by Taylor et al. (1996) &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Taylor, J. R., Cooren, F., Giroux, N., &amp; Robichaud, D. (1996). The communicational basis of organization: Between the conversation and the text. Communication theory, 6(1), 1-39.&lt;/ref&gt; and the volume edited by Cooren, Taylor, and Van Emery (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Cooren F., Taylor J. R., Van Emery E. J. (2006). Communication as organizing: Empirical and theoretical exploration in the dynamic of text and conversation. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The Montréal school foregrounds process of coorientation, or the orientation of two individuals to one another, and the object of conversation. Cooren, Kuhn, Cornelissen, and Clark (2011) &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Cooren F., Kuhn T., Cornelissen J. P., Clark T. (2011). Communication, organizing, and organization: An overview and introduction to the special issue. Organization Studies, 32, 1149-1170.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that coorientation occurs when individuals focus on each other and the multitudes of agencies within the organizational environment. Cooren et al. (2011), the current leading voice in the Montréal school, suggests that Greimas language theory (described by Cooren &amp; Taylor, 2006 as almost incomprehensible) and Latour’s (1995, 2005) Actor Network Theory are the basis of the Montréal school’s thinking. Taylor and Van Every (2001) rely on Austin’s (1962) and Searle’s (1975) Speech Act Theory.

Two central terms to the Montréal school are derived from Austin’s work on language: text and conversation. The text represents big ‘D’ Discourse in the organization, or the way people talk, while conversation represents the messages exchanged between two parties that solidify into text. In this way, Taylor et al. (1996) claim that organizations are not real in the material sense; instead, organizations are a culmination of conversations and texts. Further, Taylor et al. (1996) suggest that organizations always speak through an agent. Over the course of time, distanciation, or solidification of various texts lead to what laypeople refer to as the organization, occurs.

Taylor et al. (1996) propose several degrees of separation between text and conversation. First, text is translated into action through the ability of communication to carry intention. Second, conversation turns into a narrative representation as interlocutors agree on meaning. Third, text is translating into (semi)permanent medium; for example, we write down regulations in an employee handbook. Such medium permits storage of texts to help them become conversation. Fourth, these media specialize the language as professionalism. Fifth, physical and material structures are created by the organization to perpetuate conversation. Finally, publication, dissemination, diffusion, and other forms of broadcast are employed to convey the message created by members of the organization. Through this CCO process, the social arrangements of the workplace become codified. The Montréal school’s proponents contend that the essence of organizing is captured in the submission, imbrication, and embeddedness of text and conversation (Schoeneborn et al., 2014).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Schoeneborn, D., Blaschke, S., Cooren, F., McPhee, R. D., Seidl, D., &amp; Taylor, J. R. (2014). The three schools of CCO thinking: Interactive dialogue and systematic comparison. Management Communication Quarterly, 28(2), 285-316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other key terms are related with the Montréal school: coorientation (Taylor, 2009),&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, James R.
2009 Organizing from the bottom up? Reflections on the constitution of organization in communication in Building theories of organization: The constitutive role of communication. L. L. Putnam and A.

R., Van Every E. J. (Eds.), Communication as organizing: Empirical and theoretical explorations in the dynamic of text and conversations (pp. 81-100). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; closure (Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2004),&lt;ref&gt;Cooren, F., &amp; Fairhurst, G. T. (2004). Speech timing and spacing: The phenomenon of organizational closure. Organization, 11(6), 793-824.&lt;/ref&gt; hybridity (Castor &amp; Cooren, 2006), imbrication (Taylor, 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J. R. (2011). Organization as an (imbricated) configuring of transactions. Organization Studies, 32(9), 1273-1294.&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently ventriloquism (Cooren et al. 2013). Coorientation, as described above is an A-B-X relationship between two actors and an object; the object can be psychological, physical, or social. A plenum of agencies refers to the potential of both human and non-human actants (a term borrowed from Actor Network Theory; Latour, 1995) to interact within the organizational environment. Closure is the punctuation of conversations to provide deeper understanding by interlocutors. Hybridity refers to human and nonhuman actants working together to co-orient a claim. Imbrication refers to the emerging structures created by discourse in the organization over time that become an unquestioned part of what we call the organization. Finally, ventriloquism is the study of how interacts (both human and non-human) position and are positioned by the need to act via different values, principles, interests, norms, experiences, and other structures.

== Luhmann's Social Systems ==
Luhmann's systems theory focuses on three topics, which are interconnected in his entire work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schoeneborn|first=Dennis|date=2011-05-19|title=Organization as Communication|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0893318911405622|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=663–689|doi=10.1177/0893318911405622|issn=0893-3189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Systems theory as societal theory
# Communication theory and
# Evolution theory
 
The core element of Luhmann's theory is communication. Social systems are systems of communication, and society is the most encompassing social system. Being the social system that comprises all (and only) communication, today's society is a world society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A system is defined by a boundary between itself and its environment, dividing it from an infinitely complex, or (colloquially) chaotic, exterior. The interior of the system is thus a zone of reduced complexity: Communication within a system operates by selecting only a limited amount of all information available outside. This process is also called "reduction of complexity". The criterion according to which information is selected and processed is meaning (in German, Sinn). Both social systems and psychical or personal systems (see below for an explanation of this distinction) operate by processing meaning.

The third strand of CCO was first acknowledged by Taylor (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, L. L., Phillips, N., &amp; Chapman, P. (1996). Metaphors of communication and organizations. In S. R. Clegg, &amp; W. R. Nord (Eds''.'')'', Handbook of organization studies'' (pp. 375-408). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. &lt;/ref&gt; but has only recently been included as a strand of CCO theorizing&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Luhmann (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. (1995). ''Social systems''. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; claims that individuals do not create meaning, instead all meaning comes from social systems. Perhaps this is why Luhmann’s general system perspective has only recently been considered a part of the CCO body of scholarship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Luhmann takes care to define communication as a tripartite conceptualization of interactive forces. Specifically, Seidl (2014)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; explains that Luhmann suggests communication is an amalgam of information, utterance, and understanding. Whereas information is what is contained in a message, utterance is how the communication is conducted, and understanding “refers to the distinction between information and utterance” (p.&amp;nbsp;290). Luhmann’s perspective is a radical departure from traditional communication scholarship. Putnam and Fairhurst (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Linda L.|last2=Fairhurst|first2=Gail T.|date=2015-10-21|title=Revisiting “Organizations as Discursive Constructions”: 10 Years Later|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/comt.12074|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=375–392|doi=10.1111/comt.12074|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt; explain that the Luhmannian perspective is wholly communicative; that is, meaning is complete up to utterances in a given communicative interaction.

Luhmann’s perspective gives less value to human agency in favor of a social agentic perspective. For this reason, Seidl claims that CCO research using Luhmann’s version should focus on communication not on actors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Human agency is minimized by this perspective. Psychic systems (i.e., the mind) interact with social systems (i.e., an organic conglomerate of multiple psychic systems) and human actors are not relevant to the constitution of organizations.&lt;ref name="Schools" /&gt;

'''Cuitlatec''', or '''Cuitlateco''', is an extinct language of [[Mexico]], formerly spoken by an [[indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous people]] known as [[Cuitlatec people|Cuitlatec]].

==Classification==
Cuitlatec has not been convincingly classified as belonging to any [[language family]].  It is believed to be language isolate.  In their controversial classification of the [[indigenous languages of the Americas]], Greenberg and Ruhlen include Cuitlatec in an expanded [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan]] language family ([[Macro-Chibchan]]), along with a variety of other Mesoamerican and South American languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Geographic distribution==
Cuitlatec was spoken in the [[Mexican state|state]] of [[Guerrero]].  By the 1930s, Cuitlatec was spoken only in [[San Miguel Totolapan]].  The last speaker of the language,  Juana Can, is believed to have died in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Hern/&gt;

A '''defensible space''', in the context of [[fire control]], is a natural and/or landscaped area around a structure that has been maintained and designed to reduce fire danger. The practice is sometimes called  '''firescaping'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/landscape%20checklist.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626085521/http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/landscape%20checklist.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-26 |df= }} SBCFD-Firescaping.

Firefighters sometimes do not attempt to protect structures without adequate defensible space, as it is less safe and less likely to succeed.

*A first concept of defensible space for most fire agencies' primary goal of fuel reduction is a recommended or required defensible space around a structure to extend for at least {{convert|100|ft|m}} in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/defensible_space_requlation.pdf SBCFD-regulation. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*A second concept of defensible space is "fuel reduction." This means plants are selectively thinned and pruned to reduce the combustible fuel mass of the remaining plants. The goal is to break up the more continuous and dense uninterrupted layer of vegetation.
*A third concept of defensible space is "[[fuel ladder]]" management. Like rungs on a ladder, vegetation can be present at varying heights from groundcover to trees. Ground fuel "rungs", such as dried grasses, can transmit fire to shrub rungs, which then transmit up tree branch rungs into the tree canopy. A burning tree produces embers that can blow to new areas, spreading and so making it more difficult to control a wildland fire. One guideline is for a typical separation of three times the height of the lower fuel to the next fuel ladder. For example, a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} shrub under a tree would need a spacing of {{convert|6|ft|m}} to the lowest limbs of the tree. Since wildfires burn faster uphill than on flat land, fuel ladder spacing may need to be greater for slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419051651/http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp.html |archivedate=2010-04-19 |df= }} SBCFD-intro. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape use==
The term defensible space in landscape ("firescape") use refers to the {{convert|100|ft|m}} zone surrounding a structure. Often the location is in the [[wildland–urban interface]]. This area need not be devoid of vegetation by using naturally fire resistive plants that are spaced, pruned and trimmed, and irrigated, to minimize the fuel mass available to ignite and also to hamper the spread of a fire.

#The first {{convert|30|ft|m}} is the "Defensible Space Zone," of a defensible space around a structure. It is where [[vegetation]] is kept to a minimum combustible mass. A guideline used in this zone can be "low, lean and green."
#The second distance of {{convert|30|to|100|ft|m}}, is the "Reduced Fuel Zone" of a defensible space around a structure. In this area of the defensible space, fuels/vegetation are separated vertically and horizontally depending on the vegetation type. This is done by: thinning, pruning, and removal of selected vegetation; and limbing up trees from lower vegetation and the lateral separation of [[canopy (forest)|tree canopies]]. types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/defensible_space_guidelines.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716012355/http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/defensible_space_guidelines.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }} CAL-FIRE-guidelines. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An important component is ongoing maintenance of the fire-resistant landscaping for reduced fuel loads and fire fighting access. Fire resistive plants that are not maintained can [[Desiccation|desiccate]], die, or amass [[Coarse woody debris|deadwood debris]], and become fire assistive. Irrigation systems and pruning can help maintain a plant's fire resistance. Maintaining access roads and driveways clear of side and low-hanging vegetation can allow large fire equipment to reach properties and structures.
Some agencies recommend clearing combustible vegetation at minimum horizontal 10&amp;nbsp;ft from roads and driveways a vertical of 13&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;inches above them. Considering the plant material involved is important to not create unintended consequences to habitat integrity and unnecessary aesthetic issues. Street signs, and homes clearly identified with the numerical address, assist access also.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/homeowners_checklist.pdf  SBCFD Retrieved 4/26/2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/landscape%20checklist.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626085521/http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/landscape%20checklist.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-26 |df= }} SBCFD-checklist. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unintended consequences==
The unintended negative consequences of [[erosion]] and native [[habitat]] loss can result from some unskillful defensible space applications. The disturbance of the soil surface, such as garden [[Tillage|soil cultivation]] in and [[firebreak]]s beyond native landscape zones areas, destroys the native plant cover and exposes open soil, accelerating [[invasive species]] of plants ("invasive exotics") spreading and replacing native [[habitat]]s.&lt;ref name=neutral&gt;{{citation| last=Colautti| first=Robert I.; MacIsaac, Hugh J.| title=A neutral terminology to define 'invasive' species| journal= Diversity and Distributions|year=2004|url=http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf|format=PDF| volume=10| pages=135–141| accessdate=2007-07-11| doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In suburban and [[wildland–urban interface]] areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for defensible space can result in mistaken excessive [[clearcutting]] of native and [[Introduced species|non-invasive introduced]] shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for [[Invasive species|invasive plant species]], and also to erosion and landslides. Negative aesthetic consequences to natural and landscaped areas can be minimized with integrated and balanced defensible space practices.&lt;ref&gt;(September 21, 2006).

[[Image:Beaver.jpg|thumb|[[Beavers]] are the prototypical ecosystem engineer because of the effects their [[beaver dam|dams]] have on [[Channel (geography)|channel]] flow, [[geomorphology]], and ecology.]]
[[Image:Rockfish around kelp Monterey Bay Aquarium.jpg|thumb|upright|Kelp are autogenic ecosystem engineers, by building the necessary structure for kelp forests]]

An '''ecosystem engineer''' is any [[organism]] that creates, significantly modifies, maintains or destroys a [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. These organisms can have a large impact on the [[species richness]] and landscape-level [[heterogeneity]] of an area.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Justin P | last2 = Jones | first2 = Clive G | last3 = Flecker | first3 = Alexander S | year = 2002 | title = An ecosystem engineer, the beaver, increases species richness at the landscape scale | url = | journal = Ecosystems Ecology | volume = 132 | issue = 1| pages = 96–101 | doi=10.1007/s00442-002-0929-1| pmid = 28547281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, ecosystem engineers are important for maintaining the health and stability of the environment they are living in. Since all organisms impact the environment they live in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in one way or another, it has been proposed that the term "ecosystem engineers" be used only for [[keystone species]] whose behavior very strongly affects other organisms.&lt;ref name= Haemig&gt;[Haemig PD (2012). Ecosystem Engineers: wildlife that create, modify and maintain habitats.  ECOLOGY.INFO #12]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Jones et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = CG | last2 = Lawton | first2 = JH | last3 = Shachak | first3 = M | year = 1994 | title = Organisms as ecosystem engineers | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 69 | issue = 3| pages = 373–386 | doi=10.2307/3545850| jstor = 3545850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified two different types of ecosystem engineers:

===Allogenic engineers===

Allogenic engineers modify the [[environment (biophysical)]] by mechanically changing living or nonliving materials from one form to another. [[Beaver]]s are the original model for ecosystem engineers; in the process of [[clearcutting]] and damming, beavers alter their [[ecosystem]] extensively. The addition of a dam will change both the distribution and the abundance of many organisms in the area.&lt;ref name= Haemig /&gt; [[Caterpillars]] are another example in that by creating shelters from leaves, they are also creating shelters for other organisms which may occupy them either simultaneously or subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = CG | last2 = Lawton | first2 = JH | last3 = Shachak | first3 = M | year = 1997 | title = Positive and negative effects of organisms as physical ecosystem engineers | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 78 | issue = 7| pages = 1946–1957 | doi=10.2307/2265935| jstor = 2265935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional example may be that of [[woodpecker]]s or other birds who create holes in trees for them to nest in. Once these birds are through with them, the holes are used by other species of birds or mammals for housing.&lt;ref name= Haemig /&gt;

===Autogenic engineers===

Autogenic engineers modify the environment by modifying themselves. Trees are a good example, because as they grow, their trunks and branches create habitats for other living things; these may include squirrels, birds or insects among others. In the tropics, [[liana]]s connect trees, which allow many animals to travel exclusively through the forest canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.eoearth.org/article/Ecosystem_engineer|title= Ecosystem engineer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Being able to identify ecosystem engineers in an environment can be important when looking at the influence these individuals may have over other organisms living in the same environment – especially in terms of resource availability.&lt;ref name= Chapman&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = Colin A | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Are primates ecosystem engineers? | doi = 10.1007/s10764-012-9645-9 | journal = International Journal of Primatology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of some ecosystem engineers has been linked to higher species richness at the [[landscape]] level. By modifying the habitat, organisms like the beaver create more habitat heterogeneity and so can support species not found elsewhere.&lt;ref name= Wright /&gt; Thoughts may be that similar to other [[umbrella species]] by conserving an ecosystem engineer you may be able to protect the overall diversity of a landscape.&lt;ref name= Wright /&gt; Beavers have also been shown to maintain habitats in such a way as to protect the rare [[Saint Francis' satyr]] butterfly and increase plant diversity.&lt;ref name= Bartel&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bartel | first1 = Rebecca A | last2 = Haddad | first2 = Nick M | last3 = Wright | first3 = Justin P | year = 2010 | title = Ecosystem engineers maintain a rare species of butterfly and increase plant diversity | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 119 | issue = 5| pages = 883–890 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.18080.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biodiversity]] may also be affected by ecosystem engineer's ability to increase the complexity of processes within an ecosystem, potentially allowing greater [[species richness]] and diversity in the local environments. As an example, beavers have the capacity to modify riparian forest and expand wetland habitats, which results in an increase of the diversity of the habitats by allowing a greater number of species to inhabit the landscape. [[Coral reef|Coral-reef habitats]], created by the ecosystem engineer coral species, hold some of the highest abundances of aquatic species in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Biodiversity effects of ecosystem engineers are stronger on more complex ecosystem processes|journal = Ecology|date = 1 September 2013|issn = 1939-9170|pages = 1977–1985|volume = 94|issue = 9|doi = 10.1890/12-1385.1|language = en|first = Adriano|last = Caliman|first2 = Luciana S.|last2 = Carneiro|first3 = João J. F.|last3 = Leal|first4 = Vinicius F.|last4 = Farjalla|first5 = Reinaldo L.|last5 = Bozelli|first6 = Francisco A.|last6 = Esteves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduced species as ecosystem engineers==
Species are able to be transported across all parts of the world by humans or human-made vessels at boundless rates resulting in foreign ecosystem engineers changing the dynamics of species interactions and the possibility for engineering to occur in locations that would not have been accessible by engineers without the mediation by humans.

[[Introduced species]], which may be [[invasive species]], are often ecosystem engineers. [[Kudzu]], a leguminous plant introduced to the southeast U.S., changes the distribution and number of animal and bird species in the areas it invades. It also crowds out native plant species. The [[zebra mussel]] is an ecosystem engineer in North America. By providing refuge from [[predator]]s, it encourages the growth of freshwater [[invertebrate]]s through increasing microhabitats. Light penetration into infected lakes also improves the ecosystem, resulting in an increase in [[algae]]. In contrast to the benefits some ecosystem engineers can cause, invasive species often have the reverse effect.

[[File:Gordon Dam.jpg|thumb|Gordon Dam]]

==Humans as ecosystem engineers==
Humans are thought to be one of the most dramatic ecosystem engineers. [[Niche construction]] has been prevalent since the earliest days of human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Bruce D.|date=30 March 2007|title=The Ultimate Ecosystem Engineers|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5820/1797|journal=Science|language=en|volume=315|issue=5820|pages=1797–1798|doi=10.1126/science.1137740|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17395815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through urban development, agricultural practices, logging, damming and mining, humans have changed the way they interact with the environment. 
This interaction is more studied in the field of [[human ecology]].

Due to the complexity of many communities and ecosystems, restoration projects are often difficult. Ecosystem engineers have been proposed as a means to restore a given area to its previous state. While ideally these would all be natural agents, with today's level of development some form of human intervention may be necessary as well. In addition to being able to assist in [[restoration ecology]], ecosystem engineers may be a helpful agent in [[invasive species]] management.&lt;ref name= Byers&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Byers | first1 = James E | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2006 | title = Using ecosystem engineers to restore ecological systems | url = | journal = Ecology and Evolution | volume = 21 | issue = 9| pages = 493–500 | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.06.002| pmid = 16806576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New fields are developing which focus on restoring those ecosystems which have been disrupted or destroyed by human activities as well as developing ecosystems that are sustainable with both human and ecological values.&lt;ref name= Mitsch&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitsch | first1 = William J | year = 2012 | title = What is ecological engineering? | url = | journal = Ecological Engineering | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 5–12 | doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.04.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Terrestrial environments===

Besides the previously mentioned beaver acting as an ecosystem engineer, other terrestrial animals do the same. This may be through feeding habits, migration patterns or other behaviors that result in more permanent changes.

Research has suggested primates as ecosystem engineers as a result of their feeding strategies – [[frugivory]] and [[folivory]] – making them act as seed dispersers.&lt;ref name= Chapman /&gt; As a whole primates are very abundant and feed on a large quantity of fruit that is then distributed around their territory. Elephants have also been designated ecosystem engineers as they cause very large changes to their environment whether it be through feeding, digging or migratory behavior.&lt;ref name= Hayes&gt;[Hayes, Gary. (2012). Elephants (and extinct relatives) as earth-movers and ecosystem engineers. Geomorphology 157–158: 99–107.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only animals are ecosystem engineers. Fungi are able to connect regions that are distant from one another and translocate nutrients between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boddy|first1=Lynne|last2=Watkinson|first2=Sarah C.|title=Wood decomposition, higher fungi, and their role in nutrient redistribution|journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|date=31 December 1995|volume=73|issue=S1|pages=1377–1383|doi=10.1139/b95-400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doing so they create nutritional niches for xylophagous invertebrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Filipiak|first1=Michał|last2=Sobczyk|first2=Łukasz|last3=Weiner|first3=January|title=Fungal Transformation of Tree Stumps into a Suitable Resource for Xylophagous Beetles via Changes in Elemental Ratios|journal=Insects|date=9 April 2016|volume=7|issue=2|pages=13|doi=10.3390/insects7020013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Filipiak|first1=Michał|last2=Weiner|first2=January|last3=Wilson|first3=Richard A.|title=How to Make a Beetle Out of Wood: Multi-Elemental Stoichiometry of Wood Decay, Xylophagy and Fungivory|journal=PLoS ONE|date=23 December 2014|volume=9|issue=12|pages=e115104|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0115104|pmid=25536334|pmc=4275229}}&lt;/ref&gt; supply trees with N translocated from previously predated animals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wardle|first1=D. A.|title=Ecological Linkages Between Aboveground and Belowground Biota|journal=Science|date=11 June 2004|volume=304|issue=5677|pages=1629–1633|doi=10.1126/science.1094875|pmid=15192218}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even form an "underground pipeline" that redistributes carbon between trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=T.|last2=Siegwolf|first2=R. T. W.|last3=Korner|first3=C.|title=Belowground carbon trade among tall trees in a temperate forest|journal=Science|date=14 April 2016|volume=352|issue=6283|pages=342–344|doi=10.1126/science.aad6188|pmid=27081070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus fungi are engineers controlling nutrient cycles in ecosystems.

[[Prairie dogs]] are another terrestrial form of allogenic ecosystem engineers due to the fact that the species has the ability to perform substantial modifications by burrowing and turning soil. They are able to influence soils and vegetation of the landscape while providing underground corridors for [[arthropods]], [[avians]], other small [[mammals]], and [[reptiles]]. This has a positive effect on species richness and diversity of their habitats which results in the prairie dogs being labelled as keystone species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Bruce W.|last2=Augustine|first2=David J.|last3=Sedgwick|first3=James A.|last4=Lubow|first4=Bruce C.|date=1 February 2013|title=Ecosystem engineering varies spatially: a test of the vegetation modification paradigm for prairie dogs|journal=Ecography|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=230–239|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07614.x|issn=1600-0587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine environments===

In marine environments, [[filter feeders]] and [[plankton]] are ecosystem engineers because they alter turbidity and light penetration, controlling the depth at which [[photosynthesis]] can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berke | first1 = Sarah K | year = 2012 | title = Functional Groups of Ecosystem Engineers: A Proposed Classification with Comments on Current Issues | doi = 10.1093/icb/icq077 | pmid = 21558195 | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 50 | issue = 2| pages = 147–157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn limits the primary productivity of [[benthic zone|benthic]] and [[pelagic zone|pelagic]] habitats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abrahams | first1 = MV | last2 = Kattenfeld | first2 = MG | year = 1997 | title = The role of turbidity as a constraint on predator–prey interactions in aquatic environments | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 169–74 | doi=10.1007/s002650050330}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influences consumption patterns between [[trophic level|trophic]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartman | first1 = EJ | last2 = Abrahams | first2 = MV | year = 2000 | title = Sensory compensation and the detection of predators: the interaction between chemical and visual information | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 267 | issue = 1443| pages = 571–75 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1039| pmid = 10787160 | pmc = 1690576 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of ecosystem engineers in marine environments would be [[scleractinian corals]] as they create the framework for the habitat most coral-reef organisms depend on.&lt;ref name=Wild&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wild | first1 = Christian | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Climate change impedes scleractinian corals as primary reef ecosystem engineers | doi = 10.1071/mf10254 | journal = Marine and Freshwater Research | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 205–215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ecosystem engineers such as coral have help maintaining their environment. [[Parrotfish]] often help maintain coral reefs as they feed on macroalgae that competes with the coral.&lt;ref name= Bozec&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bozec | first1 = Yves-Marie | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Reciprocal facilitation and non-linearity maintain habitat engineering on coral reefs | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 122 | issue = 3| pages = 428–440 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20576.x| citeseerx = 10.1.1.457.9673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As this relationship is mutually beneficial, a positive feedback cycle is formed between the two organisms, making them both responsible for creating and maintaining coral reef ecosystems.&lt;ref name= Bozec /&gt;

'''Elizabeth Watkin-Jones''' (13 July 1887 – 9 June 1966)&lt;ref name="Welsh Biography"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-WATK-ELI-1887.html| title=Watkin-Jones, Elizabeth | work=[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]] | author=[[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]] | year=1959 | accessdate=29 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Wales|Welsh]] children's book author, who wrote in the [[Welsh language]].

==Life history==

Henry Parry was a sea captain who drowned in [[Iquique]] harbour in Chile without seeing his daughter.&lt;ref name="BBC Biog"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=cy&amp;u=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/adloniant/llyfrau/straeon/010621watkin.shtml&amp;ei=rcIETMe6GYHw0wTZ_q3MAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCIQ7gEwAg&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DCymru%2527r%2BPlant%2B%2Bwatkin-jones%26hl%3Den%26rls%3Dcom.microsoft:en-gb:IE-SearchBox%26rlz%3D1I7GFRE_en| title=Ei thaflu o'r capel efo'i bwgan brain! | work=BBC | author= | date=21 June 2001 | accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watkin-Jones was educated in the school in Nefyn, Pwllheli county school, and in the Normal College, Bangor.&lt;ref name="Welsh Biography"/&gt; She became an infants teacher and taught in several schools, in South and North Wales, including [[Aberdare]], [[Onllwyn]], [[Porthmadog]], [[Trefriw]] and Nefyn . In February 1916 she married John Watkin-Jones, who was also a school teacher. After World War I, she lived for a short time in [[Merthyr Tydfil|Merthyr]] before returning to Nefyn in 1920 after her husband was appointed headteacher there.&lt;ref name="Welsh Biography"/&gt; She died in 1966 and was cremated at [[Colwyn Bay]] where her ashes were scattered.

==Writing career==
Watkin-Jones first wrote stories in the English language for children, published in children's publications such as ''Chicks' Own'' and ''Fairyland Tales''. She then turned her hand to writing in Welsh, and between 1939 and 1949 she won many awards at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] for stories, novels and plays for children.

Watkin-Jones wrote five books of short plays for children, including ''Onesimus'' (1947) and ''Pwt a Moi'' (1953). She also wrote seven novels or historical stories, all for children, between 1939 and 1955, her personal favourite being ''Plant y Mynachdy'' (1939).

Sexual harassment by strangers, as with any type of harassment, has been a notoriously difficult crime to prove, as perpetrators often devise discreet ways to harass women, although Eve teasing usually occurs in [[public space]]s and streets and on public transport.&lt;ref name=cho&gt;{{citation| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=G4oDbma2Y0MC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=eve-teasing#PPA44,M1 |title= In Public Spaces: Security in the Street and in the Chowk |work= Women, Security, South Asia: A Clearing in the Thicket |first1= Farah |last1= Faizal |first2= Swarna |last2= Rajagopalan| publisher= SAGE |year= 2005| isbn= 0-7619-3387-5 |page= 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some guidebooks to the region warn female tourists to avoid attracting the attention of these kinds of men by wearing conservative clothing.&lt;ref name="LonelyPlanet001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/practical-information/health |title=India – Practical information – Health &amp; Safety |publisher=Lonely Planet |work=Lonelyplanet.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68FQlO5FC?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/practical-information/health |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FrommersIndia001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/india/3475028784.html |title=India – Tips for Women Travelers |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |work=Frommer's |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68FRnELMb?url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/india/3475028784.html |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this harassment is reported both by Indian women and by conservatively dressed foreign women.&lt;ref name=BBC-13Jan12&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16503338 |title= Eve teasing in India: Assault or harassment by another name |first= Nidhi |last= Dutt |publisher= BBC |date= 13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The problem first received public and media attention in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Eve-Teasing |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897530,00.html |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=12 September 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waywordradio.org/?s=eve-teasing Historical citations of the phrase] at WayWordRadio.org&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decades, more and more women started attending college and working independently, meaning that they were often no longer accompanied by a male escort as had been the norm in traditional society. In response, the problem grew to alarming proportions, despite this not being the case in other cultures where women go and come as they please.&lt;ref name=pol&gt;{{citation| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RKnClbGW9-AC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=eve-teasing&amp;lr= |title= Role of Women Police |work= Women Police in a Changing Society: Back Door to Equality |first= Mangai |last= Natarajan |publisher= Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year= 2008| isbn= 0-7546-4932-6 |page= 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the [[Government of India|Indian government]] had to take remedial measures, both judicial and law enforcement, to curb the practice. Efforts were made to sensitise the police about the issue, and police started to round up Eve teasers. The deployment of plain-clothed female police officers for the purpose has been particularly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.oneindia.com/2006/08/28/special-squad-to-nab-eve-teasers-formed-in-kerala-1156746313.html |title= Special squad to nab eve teasers formed in Kerala | work= OneIndia | publisher= Greynium Information Technologies Pvt. Ltd. | date= 28 August 2006 |accessdate= 8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other measures taken in various [[States and union territories of India|states]] by the police were setting up of dedicated women's helplines in various cities, police stations staffed by women, and special police cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indopia.in/India-usa-uk-news/latest-news/507034/National/1/20/1 |title=Special team to check roadside romeos in Allahabad |date=20 February 2009 |website=Indopia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413024554/http://www.indopia.in/India-usa-uk-news/latest-news/507034/National/1/20/1 |archive-date=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also seen during this period was a marked rise in the number of women coming forward to report cases of sexual harassment, due to changing public opinion against this practice. In addition, the severity of these incidents grew as well, in some cases leading to [[acid throwing]], which in turn led to states like [[Tamil Nadu]] making it a non-bailable offense. The number of women's organisations and those working for [[women's rights]] also increased, and during this period reports of [[bride burning]] increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.sage-ereference.com/view/law/n64.xml | title= Bride Burning | author=Linda S. Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in the number of violent incidents involving women meant previously lackadaisical attitudes towards women's rights had to be revised and supported by law. In the coming years, certain organisations played a key role in lobbying for the passing of legislation designed to protect women from aggressive behaviour from strangers, including 'The Delhi Prohibition of Eve-teasing Bill 1984'.&lt;ref name=pol/&gt;

The death of a female student, Sarika Shah, in [[Chennai]] in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Hindu : Hassled, but helpless|url = http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/09/10/stories/2002091000070100.htm|website = www.thehindu.com|access-date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in some tough laws to counter the problem in [[South India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 July 1998 |title=Murder charges in eve-teasing case |url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19980727/20850084.html |newspaper=Indian Express |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015021542/http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19980727/20850084.html |archive-date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After murder charges were brought, about a half-dozen reports of [[suicide]] have been attributed to pressures caused by this behaviour.&lt;ref name=pol/&gt; In February 2009, female students from [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda|Maharaja Sayajirao University]] (MSU) in [[Vadodara]] assaulted four young men near the family and community sciences faculty, after the men made lewd comments about a girl student staying in SD Hall hostel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-02-23/vadodara/28032265_1_eve-teasers-hostel-girl-students |title= MSU hostel girls beat up eve teasers |newspaper= The Times of India |date= 23 February 2009 |location= Vadodara | accessdate= 8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other cases go unreported for fear of reprisals and exposure to public shame. In some cases police let the offenders go, after public humiliation through the [[murga punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/lucknow-times/public-prosecution-crime-and-instant-punishment/articleshow/1690507.cms |title= Public prosecution: Crime and instant punishment! |first= Arunima |last= Srivastava |newspaper= The Times of India |date= 29 June 2006 |accessdate= 9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a Delhi court ordered a 19-year-old youth caught making lewd remarks to passing females to distribute 500 handbills to youngsters outside schools and colleges detailing the consequences of indecent conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 June 2008 |title=Youth held for eve-teasing, told to distribute handouts |url=http://www.screenindia.com/news/youth-held-for-eveteasing-told-to-distribute-handouts/320866/ |publisher=ScreenIndia.com |agency=[[Indian Express]] News Service |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224210700/http://www.screenindia.com/news/youth-held-for-eveteasing-told-to-distribute-handouts/320866/ |archive-date=24 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction in popular culture==
Some depictions in [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]] shows mild teasing as a part of flirtatious beginnings of a courtship, along with the usual accompaniment of song and dance routines, which invariably results in the heroine submitting to the hero's advances towards the end of the song. Young men tend to emulate the example depicted so flawlessly on screen; the term ''roadside Romeos''&lt;ref name=cho/&gt; even made it to film in ''[[Roadside Romeo]]'' (2007).

It also has been popularly depicted that when a girl is teased in this way, the hero will come and beat the guy up, such as in the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] films ''Madhumasam'', ''Magadheera''and Eega. and also the [[Hindi]] film ''Wanted''. Nowadays, this issue is also featured in Indian television [[soap opera|soaps]] like ''[[Savdhaan India]]'' and [[Crime Patrol (TV series)|''Crime Patrol'']].

==Legal redress==
[[File:INAFI-WIKI 01.jpg|thumb|Campaign "I Never Ask for It", organised by [[Blank Noise]], that addresses eve teasing and violence justified through blame, across spaces and as experienced by multiple identities of women in India]]
Although [[Law of India|Indian law]] doesn't use the term ''Eve teasing'', victims earlier usually seek recourse through Section 294 of the [[Indian Penal Code]], which sentences a man found guilty of making a girl or woman the target of obscene gestures, remarks, songs or recitation to a maximum jail sentence of three months. Section 292 of the IPC clearly spells out that showing pornographic or obscene pictures, books or papers to a woman or girl results in a fine of {{INRConvert|2000}} with two years' imprisonment for first offenders. In the case of a repeated offense, the offender may have a fine of {{INRConvert|5000}} with five years' imprisonment imposed. Under Section 509 of the IPC, obscene gestures, indecent body language and negative comments directed at any woman or girl or exhibiting any object which intrudes upon the privacy of a woman, carries a penalty of imprisonment for one year or a fine or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jO2ts0jpNsAC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=eve-teasing&amp;lr= |title= Eve teasing |work= Encyclopaedia of Social Change |first= Laxmi |last= Devi |publisher= Anmol Publications PVT.

The Amendment also introduced new sections making acts like disrobing a woman without consent, [[stalking]] and sexual acts by person in authority an offense.

The [[National Commission for Women]] (NCW) also proposed No 9. Eve Teasing (New Legislation) 1988.&lt;ref name=nat&gt;[http://ncw.nic.in/frmReportLaws09.aspx Laws and Legislative Measures Affecting Women], [[National Commission for Women]] (NCW).&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Parliament has passed the [[Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013]], which add protections for female workers in most workplaces. The Act came into force from 9 December 2013.

==Public response==

''Nirbhaya Karnataka'' ("Fearless Karnataka") is a coalition of many individuals and groups including Alternative Law Forum, Blank Noise, Maraa, Samvada and Vimochana. After the rise of eve teasing cases in the 2000s, it organised several public awareness campaigns, including [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]], followed by another public art project titled, The [[Blank Noise]] Project, starting in [[Bangalore]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Mar72009/metrosat20090306122452.asp | title= Not just eve-teasing! | newspaper= [[Deccan Herald]] | date= 7 March 2009 | accessdate= 9 February 2015 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150209202959/http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Mar72009/metrosat20090306122452.asp | archivedate= 9 February 2015 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar program to fight eve-teasing was also hosted in [[Mumbai]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/mar/04mumbai.htm |title= Join the fight against eve teasing in Mumbai |work= [[Rediff.com]]| date= 4 March 2008 |accessdate= 9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22959">In [[abstract algebra]], the '''free monoid''' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is the [[monoid]] whose elements are all the [[finite sequence]]s (or strings) of zero or more elements from that set, with [[string concatenation]] as the monoid operation and with the unique sequence of zero elements, often called the [[empty string]] and denoted by ε or λ, as the [[identity element]]. The free monoid on a set ''A'' is usually denoted ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;. The '''free semigroup''' on ''A'' is the sub[[semigroup]] of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; containing all elements except the empty string. It is usually denoted ''A''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Lot23&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|1997|pp=2–3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eATLTZzwW-sC&amp;pg=PA2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PF2&gt;{{harvtxt|Pytheas Fogg|2002|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, an abstract monoid (or semigroup) ''S'' is described as '''free''' if it is [[isomorphic]] to the free monoid (or semigroup) on some set.&lt;ref name=Lot5&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name implies, free monoids and semigroups are those objects which satisfy the usual [[universal property]] defining [[free object]]s, in the respective [[category (mathematics)|categories]] of monoids and semigroups. It follows that every monoid (or semigroup) arises as a homomorphic image of a free monoid (or semigroup). The study of semigroups as images of free semigroups is called combinatorial semigroup theory.

== Examples ==

=== Natural numbers ===
The monoid ('''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''',+) of [[natural numbers]] (including zero) under addition is a free monoid on a singleton free generator, in this case the natural number 1. 
According to the formal definition, this monoid consists of all sequences like "1", "1+1", "1+1+1", "1+1+1+1", and so on, including the empty sequence. 
Mapping each such sequence to its evaluation result
&lt;ref&gt;Since addition of natural numbers is associative, the result doesn't depend on the order of evaluation, thus ensuring the mapping to be well-defined.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the empty sequence to zero establishes an isomorphism from the set of such sequences to '''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''.
This isomorphism is compatible with "+", that is, for any two sequences ''s'' and ''t'', if ''s'' is mapped (i.e. evaluated) to a number ''m'' and ''t'' to ''n'', then their concatenation ''s''+''t'' is mapped to the sum ''m''+''n''.

=== Kleene star ===
In [[formal language]] theory, usually a finite set of "symbols" A (sometimes called the alphabet) is considered. A finite sequence of symbols is called "word over ''A''", and the free monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is called the "[[Kleene star]] of ''A''".
Thus, the abstract study of formal languages can be thought of as the study of subsets of finitely generated free monoids. There are deep connections between the theory of semigroups and that of [[automata theory|automata]]. For example, the [[regular language]]s over ''A'' are the homomorphic [[Image_(mathematics)#Inverse_image|pre-images]] in ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; of subsets of finite monoids.{{clarify|reason=At least, a reference to a definition of 'homomorphic pre-image' and a reference to a proof should be added here. Also, rephrasing the sentence in singular may improve clarity.|date=August 2013}}

For example, assuming an alphabet ''A'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c''}, its Kleene star ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; contains all concatenations of ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'':
:{ε, ''a'', ''ab'', ''ba'', ''caa'', ''{{not a typo|cccbabbc}}'', ...}.

If ''A'' is any set, the ''word length'' function on ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is the unique [[monoid homomorphism]] from ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; to ('''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''',+) that maps each element of ''A'' to 1.  A free monoid is thus a '''graded monoid'''.{{clarify|reason=Give a definition of 'graded monoid' or a reference to it. A Wikipedia article 'graded ring' exists, but it doesn't define graded monoids. In case 'graded' is meant just informally, the sentence should better be rephrased as e.g. 'Due to this additional functionality, some authors call a free monoid a ⟨graded⟩ one.'|date=August 2013}}&lt;ref name=Sak382&gt;Sakarovitch (2009) p.382&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally,  the [[regular language]]s over an alphabet A are the closure of the finite subsets of A*, the free monoid over A, under union, product, and generation of submonoid.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5QbCAAAQBAJ|title=Groups, Languages, Algorithms: AMS-ASL Joint Special Session on Interactions Between Logic, Group Theory, and Computer Science, January 16-19, 2003, Baltimore, Maryland|last=Borovik|first=Alexandre|date=2005-01-01|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=9780821836187|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjugate words==
[[File:Example of strings equidivisibility.gif|thumb|Example for 1st case of equidivisibility: m="UNCLE", n="ANLY", p="UN", q="CLEANLY", and s="CLE"]]
We define a pair of words in ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; of the form ''uv'' and ''vu'' as '''conjugate''': the conjugates of a word are thus its [[circular shift]]s.&lt;ref name=Sak27&gt;Sakarovitch (2009) p.27&lt;/ref&gt;  Two words are conjugate in this sense if they are [[Conjugation (group theory)|conjugate in the sense of group theory]] as elements of the [[free group]] generated by ''A''.&lt;ref name=PF297&gt;{{harvtxt|Pytheas Fogg|2002|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equidivisibility===
A free monoid is '''equidivisible''': if the equation ''mn'' = ''pq'' holds, then there exists an ''s'' such that either ''m'' = ''ps'', ''sn'' = ''q'' (example see image) or ''ms'' = ''p'', ''n'' = ''sq''.&lt;ref name=Sak26&gt;Sakarovitch (2009) p.26&lt;/ref&gt; This result is also known as [[Levi's lemma]].&lt;ref name="LucaVarricchio2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aldo de Luca|author2=Stefano Varricchio|title=Finiteness and Regularity in Semigroups and Formal Languages|year=1999|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-64150-3|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monoid is free if and only if it is graded and equidivisible.&lt;ref name=Sak26/&gt;

== Free generators and rank ==
The members of a set ''A'' are called the '''free generators''' for ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; and ''A''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The superscript * is then commonly understood to be the [[Kleene star]]. More generally, if ''S'' is an abstract free monoid (semigroup), then a set of elements which maps onto the set of single-letter words under an isomorphism to a semigroup ''A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'' (monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) is called a ''set of free generators'' for ''S''.

Each free semigroup (or monoid) ''S'' has exactly one set of free generators, the [[cardinality]] of which is called the ''rank'' of ''S''.

Two free monoids or semigroups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same rank. In fact, ''every'' set of generators for a free semigroup or monoid ''S'' contains the free generators (see definition of generators in [[Monoid]]) since a free generator has word length 1 and hence can only be generated by itself. It follows that a free semigroup or monoid is finitely generated if and only if it has finite rank.

A [[submonoid]] ''N'' of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is '''stable''' if ''u'', ''v'', ''ux'', ''xv'' in ''N'' together imply ''x'' in ''N''.&lt;ref name=BPR61&gt;{{harvtxt|Berstel|Perrin|Reutenauer|2010|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A submonoid of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is stable if and only if it is free.&lt;ref name=BPR62&gt;{{harvtxt|Berstel|Perrin|Reutenauer|2010|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, using the set of [[bit]]s { "0", "1" } as ''A'', the set ''N'' of all bit strings containing evenly many "1"s is a stable submonoid because if ''u'' contains an even number of "1"s, and ''ux'' as well, then ''x'' must contain an even number of "1"s, too. While ''N'' cannot be freely generated by any set of single bits, it ''can'' be freely generated by the set of bit strings { "0", "11", "101", "1001", "10001", ... }.

===Codes===
A set of free generators for a free monoid ''P'' is referred to as a '''basis''' for '''P''': a set of words ''C'' is a '''code''' if ''C''* is a free monoid and ''C'' is a basis.&lt;ref name=Lot5/&gt;  A set ''X'' of words in ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is a '''prefix''', or has the '''prefix property''', if it does not contain a proper [[prefix (computer science)|(string) prefix]] of any of its elements&lt;!--- deleted, since "≤" as shorthand for "string prefix of" has not been defined yet, and is not used elsewhere in the article: that is, ''x'',''y'' in ''X'' with ''x'' ≤ ''y'' implies ''x'' = ''y''---&gt;.  Every prefix in ''A''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is a code, indeed a [[prefix code]].&lt;ref name=Lot5/&gt;&lt;ref name=BPR58&gt;{{harvtxt|Berstel|Perrin|Reutenauer|2010|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A submonoid ''N'' of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is '''right unitary''' if ''x'', ''xy'' in ''N'' implies ''y'' in ''N''.  A submonoid is generated by a prefix if and only if it is right unitary.&lt;ref name=Lot15&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free hull==
The intersection of free submonoids of a free monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is again free.&lt;ref name=Lot6&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|1997|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LotII204&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|2011|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If ''S'' is a subset of a free monoid ''A''* then the intersection of all free submonoids of ''A''* containing ''S'' is well-defined, since ''A''* itself is free, and contains ''S''; it is a free monoid.  A basis for this intersection is the '''free hull''' of ''S''.

The '''defect theorem'''&lt;ref name=Lot6/&gt;&lt;ref name=LotII204/&gt;&lt;ref name=BPR66&gt;{{harvtxt|Berstel|Perrin|Reutenauer|2010|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that if ''X'' is finite and ''C'' is the free hull of ''X'', then either ''X'' is a code and ''C'' = ''X'', or

:|''C''| ≤ |''X''| − 1 .

==Morphisms==
A [[monoid morphism]] ''f'' from a free monoid ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; to a monoid ''M'' is a map such that ''f''(''xy'') = ''f''(''x'')⋅''f''(''y'') for words ''x'',''y'' and ''f''(ε) = ι, where ε and ι denotes the identity element of ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; and ''M'', respectively.  The morphism ''f'' is determined by its values on the letters of ''B'' and conversely any map from ''B'' to ''M'' extends to a morphism.  A morphism is '''non-erasing'''&lt;ref name=Lot7&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|1997|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''continuous'''&lt;ref name=Sak25&gt;{{harvtxt|Sakarovitch|2009|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; if no letter of ''B'' maps to ι and '''trivial''' if every letter of ''B'' maps to ι.&lt;ref name=Lot164&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|1997|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A morphism ''f'' from a free monoid ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; to a free monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is '''total''' if every letter of ''A'' occurs in some word in the image of ''f''; '''cyclic'''&lt;ref name=Lot164/&gt; or '''periodic'''&lt;ref name=Sal77&gt;Salomaa (1981) p.77&lt;/ref&gt; if the image of ''f'' is contained in {''w''}&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; for some word ''w'' of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;.  A morphism ''f'' is '''''k''-uniform''' if the length |''f''(''a'')| is constant and equal to ''k'' for all ''a'' in ''A''.&lt;ref name=ApCoW522&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|2005|p=522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BR103&gt;{{cite book | last1=Berstel | first1=Jean | last2=Reutenauer | first2=Christophe | title=Noncommutative rational series with applications | series=Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Its Applications | volume=137 | location=Cambridge | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-521-19022-0 | zbl=1250.68007 | page=103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1-uniform morphism is '''strictly alphabetic'''&lt;ref name=Sak25/&gt; or a '''coding'''.&lt;ref name=AS9&gt;{{harvtxt|Allouche|Shallit|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A morphism ''f'' from a free monoid ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; to a free monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is '''simplifiable''' if there is an alphabet ''C'' of cardinality less than that of ''B'' such the morphism ''f'' factors through ''C''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, it is the composition of a morphism from ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; to ''C''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; and a morphism from that to ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;; otherwise ''f'' is '''elementary'''.  The morphism ''f'' is called a '''code''' if the image of the alphabet ''B'' under ''f'' is a code: every elementary morphism is a code.&lt;ref name=Sal72&gt;Salomaa (1981) p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test sets===
For  ''L'' a subset of ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, a finite subset ''T'' of ''L'' is a ''test set'' for ''L'' if morphisms ''f'' and ''g'' on ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; agree on ''L'' if and only if they agree on ''T''.  The '''Ehrenfeucht conjecture''' is that any subset ''L'' has a test set:&lt;ref name=Lot1789&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|1997|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been proved&lt;ref name=LotII451&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|2011|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; independently by Albert and Lawrence; McNaughton; and Guba.  The proofs rely on [[Hilbert's basis theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=A. | last=Salomaa | authorlink=Arto Salomaa | title=The Ehrenfeucht conjecture: A proof for language theorists | journal=Bulletin of the EATCS  | number=27 | date=October 1985 | pages=71–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endomorphisms==
An '''[[endomorphism]]''' of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is a morphism from ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; to itself.&lt;ref name=LotII450&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|2011|p=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[identity map]] ''I'' is an endomorphism of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the endomorphisms form a [[monoid]] under [[composition of functions]].

An endomorphism ''f'' is '''prolongable''' if there is a letter ''a'' such that ''f''(''a'') = ''as'' for a non-empty string ''s''.&lt;ref name=AS10&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

===String projection===
The operation of [[String operations#String projection|string projection]] is an endomorphism. That is, given a letter ''a'' &amp;isin; &amp;Sigma; and a string ''s'' &amp;isin; &amp;Sigma;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, the string projection ''p''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') removes every occurrence of ''a'' from ''s''; it is formally defined by

:&lt;math&gt;p_a(s) = \begin{cases} 
\varepsilon &amp; \text{if } s=\varepsilon, \text{ the empty string} \\
p_a(t) &amp; \text{if } s=ta  \\ 
p_a(t)b &amp; \text{if } s=tb \text{ and } b\ne a.   
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that string projection is well-defined even if the rank of the monoid is infinite, as the above recursive definition works for all strings of finite length. String projection is a [[morphism]] in the category of free monoids, so that

:&lt;math&gt;p_a\left(\Sigma^*\right)= \left(\Sigma-a\right)^*&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_a\left(\Sigma^*\right)&lt;/math&gt; is understood to be the free monoid of all finite strings that don't contain the letter ''a''.  The identity morphism is &lt;math&gt;p_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;,{{clarify|reason=Up to here, string projection has been defined only for single letters, not for arbitrary strings. However, the empty string ε is not a letter.|date=August 2013}} as clearly &lt;math&gt;p_\varepsilon(s)=s&lt;/math&gt; for all strings ''s''. Of course, it commutes with the operation of string concatenation, so that &lt;math&gt;p_a(st)=p_a(s)p_a(t)&lt;/math&gt; for all strings ''s'' and ''t''. There are many right inverses to string projection, and thus it is a [[split epimorphism]].

String projection is commutative, as clearly

:&lt;math&gt;p_a(p_b(s))=p_b(p_a(s)).&lt;/math&gt;

For free monoids of finite rank, this follows from the fact that free monoids of the same rank are isomorphic, as projection reduces the rank of the monoid by one.

String projection is [[idempotent]], as

:&lt;math&gt;p_a(p_a(s))=p_a(s)&lt;/math&gt;

for all strings ''s''. Thus, projection is an idempotent, commutative operation, and so it forms a bounded [[semilattice]] or a commutative [[band (algebra)|band]].

===Sturmian endomorphisms===
An endomorphism of the free monoid ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; on a 2-letter alphabet ''B'' is '''Sturmian''' if it maps every [[Sturmian word]] to a Sturmian word&lt;ref name=LotII83&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|2011|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PF197&gt;{{harvtxt|Pytheas Fogg|2002|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''locally Sturmian''' if it maps some Sturmian word to a Sturmian word.&lt;ref name=LotII85&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|2011|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sturmian endomorphisms form a submonoid of the monoid of endomorphisms of ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=LotII83/&gt;

Define endomorphisms φ and ψ of ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''B'' = {0,1}, by φ(0) = 01, φ(1) = 0 and ψ(0) = 10, ψ(1) = 0.  Then ''I'', φ and ψ are Sturmian,&lt;ref name=LotII84&gt;{{harvtxt|Lothaire|2011|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sturmian endomorphisms of ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; are precisely those endomorphisms in the submonoid of the endomorphism monoid generated by {''I'',φ,ψ}.&lt;ref name=PF197/&gt;&lt;ref name=LotII85/&gt;&lt;ref name=BS1994&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Berstel | first1=J. | last2=Séébold | first2=P. | title=A remark on morphic Sturmian words | journal=RAIRO, Inform.

==The free commutative monoid==
Given a set ''A'', the '''free [[commutative monoid]]''' on ''A'' is the set of all finite [[multiset]]s with elements drawn from ''A'', with the monoid operation being multiset sum and the monoid unit being the empty multiset.

For example, if ''A'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c''}, elements of the free commutative monoid on ''A'' are of the form
:{ε, ''a'', ''ab'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''b'', ''ab''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, ...}.

The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] states that the monoid of positive integers under multiplication is a free commutative monoid on an infinite set of generators, the [[prime number]]s.

The '''free commutative semigroup''' is the subset of the free commutative monoid which contains all multisets with elements drawn from ''A'' except the empty multiset.

==Generalization==

The [[free partially commutative monoid]], or ''[[trace monoid]]'', is a generalization that encompasses both the free and free commutative monoids as instances. This generalization finds applications in [[combinatorics]] and in the study of [[Parallel computing|parallelism]] in [[computer science]].

==Free monoids and computing==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
The free monoid on a set ''A'' corresponds to [[List (computing)|lists]] of elements from ''A'' with concatenation as the binary operation.  A [[monoid homomorphism]] from the free monoid to any other monoid (''M'',&amp;bull;) is a function ''f'' such that
* ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;…''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;bull; … &amp;bull; ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
* ''f''() = ''e''
where ''e'' is the identity on ''M''.  Computationally, every such homomorphism corresponds to a [[Map (higher-order function)|map]] operation applying ''f'' to all the elements of a list, followed by a [[Fold (higher-order function)|fold]] operation which combines the results using the binary operator &amp;bull;. This [[squiggol|computational paradigm]] (which can be generalised to non-associative binary operators) has inspired the [[MapReduce]] software framework.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

'''''Fuck''''' is an [[obscene]] [[English-language]] word&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-wiles/on-the-origin-of-fuck_b_4784565.html |title=On the Origin of F*ck |first1=Kate Wiles Ph D. in Medieval |last1=Studies |first2= |last2=researcher |first3= |last3=writer |first4=Language |last4=Consultant |date=18 February 2014 |publisher= |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which often refers to the act of [[sexual intercourse]] but is also commonly used as an [[intensifier]] or to denote disdain. While its origin is obscure, it is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475. In modern usage, the term "fuck" and its [[morphological derivation|derivatives]] (such as "fucker" and "fucking") can be used as a [[noun]], a [[verb]], an [[adjective]], an [[interjection]] or an [[adverb]]. There are many common phrases that employ the word as well as [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] that incorporate it, such as "[[motherfucker]]," "[[wikt:fuckwit|fuckwit]]" and "[[wikt:fucknut|fucknut]]".

==Offensiveness==

The word is considered obscene but is common in many informal and familiar situations.

It is unclear whether the word has always been considered vulgar or, if not, when it first came to be used to describe (often in an extremely angry, hostile or belligerent manner) unpleasant circumstances or people in an intentionally offensive way, such as in the term ''[[motherfucker]]'', one of its more common usages in some parts of the [[List of countries where English is an official language|English-speaking world]]. Some English-speaking countries censor it on television and radio. Andrea Millwood Hargrave's 2000 study of the attitudes of the British public found that ''fuck'' was considered the third-most severe profanity and its derivative ''motherfucker'' second. ''[[Cunt]]'' was considered the most severe.&lt;ref name="Hargrave"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Millwood Hargrave |first=Andrea |title=Delete Expletives?: Research Undertaken Jointly by the Advertising Standards Authority, British Broadcasting Corporation, Broadcasting Standards Commission and the Independent Television Commission |publisher=Advertising Standards Authority |year=2000 |accessdate=1 June 2013 |url=http://www.ligali.org/pdf/delete_expletives.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the word has become increasingly less vulgar and more publicly acceptable, an example of the "[[dysphemism treadmill]]", wherein former vulgarities become inoffensive and commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journalism.uoregon.edu/~tbivins/J496/readings/LANGUAGE/euphemism_defandlist.pdf |title=Euphemism definitions and list |publisher=University of Oregon |accessdate=1 June 2013 |work=Persuasion and Ethics |last=Bivins |first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;{{cite book |first=Brian |last=Christian |page=208 |title=The Most Human Human: What Artificial Intelligence Teaches Us About Being Alive |publisher=Random House Digital |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to linguist Pamela Hobbs, "notwithstanding its increasing public use, enduring cultural models that inform our beliefs about the nature of sexuality and sexual acts preserve its status as a vile utterance that continues to inspire moral outrage." Hobbs considers ''users'' rather than ''usage'' of the word and sub-divides ''users'' into 'non-users', for whom the word "evokes the core sexual meanings and associated sexual imagery that motivate the taboo", and 'users' for whom "metaphorical uses of the word ''fuck'' no more evoke images of sexual intercourse than a ten-year-old’s ‘My mom’ll kill me if she finds out’ evokes images of murder," so that the "criteria of taboo are missing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hobbs |first=Pamela |title=''Fuck'' as a metaphor for male sexual aggression |journal=[[Gender and Language]] |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=149–176 |doi=10.1558/genl.v7i2.149 |year=2013 |ref=harv }} [http://home.earthlink.net/~p37954/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/Fuck.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its increasing usage in the public forum, in 2005 the word was included for the first time as one of three vulgarities in [[The Canadian Press|The Canadian Press's]] ''Canadian Press Caps and Spelling'' guide. Journalists were advised to refrain from censoring the word but use it sparingly and only when its inclusion was essential to the story.&lt;ref name="CPmanual"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/08/14/CP_manual_adds_four-letter_expletive20050815.html |title=New edition of Canadian Press handbook includes infamous four-letter word |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430213520/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/08/14/CP_manual_adds_four-letter_expletive20050815.html |archivedate=2008-04-30 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=14 August 2005|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' states that the ultimate etymology is uncertain, but that the word is "probably cognate" with a number of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] words with meanings involving striking, rubbing and having sex or is derivative of the [[Old French]] word that meant "to fuck."&lt;ref name=oed&gt;"Fuck." ''[[OED Online]]''. Draft Revision, June 2008. [[Oxford University Press]]. Accessed 26 August 2008 [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50090566 OED.com] http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/previous-updates/march-2008-update/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germanic cognates===

The word has probable [[cognate]]s in other Germanic languages, such as German ''ficken'' (to fuck); [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''fokken'' (to breed, to beget); dialectal [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''fukka'' (to copulate), and dialectal [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''focka'' (to strike, to copulate) and ''fock'' ([[penis]]).&lt;ref name=oed /&gt; This points to a possible etymology where [[Common Germanic]] ''fuk-'' comes from an [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root meaning "to strike", cognate with non-Germanic words such as Latin ''pugno'' "I fight" or ''pugnus'' "fist".&lt;ref name=oed /&gt; By application of [[Grimm's law]], this hypothetical root has the form *''pug–''. There is a theory that ''fuck'' is most likely derived from Flemish, German, or Dutch roots, and is probably not derived from an Old English root.&lt;ref name="Sheidlower1998"/&gt;

===Latin and Greek cognates===

There may be a kinship with the Latin ''[[wikt:futuo#Latin|futuere]]'' (''futuo''), a verb with almost exactly the same meaning as the English verb "to fuck". From ''fūtuere'' came French ''foutre'', [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''fotre'', Italian ''fottere'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''futere'', vulgar peninsular Spanish ''joder'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''foder'', and the obscure English equivalent ''to [[wikt:futter|futter]]'', coined by [[Richard Francis Burton]]. However, there is no clear past lineage or derivation for the Latin word. These roots, even if cognates, are not the original Indo-European word for ''to copulate'', but [[Wayland Young]] argues that they derive from the Indo-European *''b&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;u–'' or *''b&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;ug–'' ("be", "become"), or as causative "create" [see Young, 1964]. A possible intermediate might be a Latin 4th-[[declension]] [[verbal noun]] *''fūtus'', with possible meanings including "act of (pro)creating".

However, the connection to ''futuere'' has been disputed{{nsmdns}}[[Anatoly Liberman]] calls it a "coincidence" and writes that it is not likely to have been borrowed from the [[Low German]] precursors to ''fuck''.&lt;ref name="Liberman"&gt;{{cite book |first=Anatoly |last=Liberman |title=An Analytic Dictionary of the English Etymology |year=2008 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=9781452913216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek ''phyō'' (φύω) has various meanings, including (of a man) "to beget", or (of a woman), "to give birth to".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Liddell, Henry George, &amp; Scott, Robert. ''Greek-English Lexikon''; 3rd ed. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1857; p. 1638a, b.&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] ''pephyka'' (πέφυκα) can be likened{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} to "fuck" and its equivalents in other Germanic languages.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===False etymologies===
One reason that the word ''fuck'' is so hard to trace etymologically is that it was used far more extensively in common speech than in easily traceable written forms. There are several [[urban legend|urban-legend]] [[false etymology|false etymologies]] postulating an [[acronym]]ic origin for the word. None of these acronyms were ever recorded before the 1960s, according to the authoritative [[lexicographer|lexicographical]] work ''[[The F-Word (book)|The F-Word]]'', and thus are [[backronym]]s. In any event, the word ''fuck'' has been in use far too long for some of these supposed origins to be possible. Some of these urban legends are that the word ''fuck'' came from Irish law. If a couple were caught committing [[adultery]], they would be punished "For Unlawful [[carnal knowledge|Carnal Knowledge]] In the Nude," with "FUCKIN" written on the [[stocks]] above them to denote the crime. A similar variant on this theory involves the recording by church clerks of the crime of "Forbidden Use of Carnal Knowledge." Another theory is that of a royal permission. During the [[Black Death]] in the [[Middle Ages]], towns were trying to control populations and their interactions. Since uncontaminated resources were scarce, supposedly many towns required permission to have children. Hence, the legend goes, that couples that were having children were required to first obtain royal permission (usually from a local magistrate or lord) and then place a sign somewhere visible from the road in their home that said "[[fornicate|Fornicating]] Under Consent of King," which was later shortened to "FUCK." This story is hard to document, but has persisted in oral and literary traditions for many years; however, it has been demonstrated to be an urban legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/fuck.asp |title=snopes.com: Etymology of Fuck |author= |date=8 July 2007 |work=Snopes.com |publisher= |accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different false etymology, first made popular on the radio show ''[[Car Talk]]'', states that the phrase "fuck you" comes from the phrase "pluck yew" and relates the origins of ''fuck'' to the myth surrounding the [[V sign]]. This myth states that French archers at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] insulted the English troops' ability to shoot their weapons by waving their fingers in a V shape; after the English secured an overwhelming victory, they returned the gesture. The addition of the phrase "fuck you" to the myth came when it was claimed that the English yelled that they could still "pluck yew" ([[Taxus baccata|yew]] wood being the preferred material for longbows at the time), a phrase that evolved into the modern "fuck you".&lt;ref name="Sheidlower1998"/&gt;

==Grammar==
''Fuck'' has a very flexible role in English grammar, including use as both a [[Transitive verb|transitive]] and [[intransitive verb|intransitive]] [[verb]], and as an [[adjective]], [[adverb]], and [[noun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26UA578yQ5g |title=the word fuck |first= |last=wickedwildabeast666 |date=23 September 2007 |publisher= |accessdate=30 December 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as an [[interjection]] and a [[Ejaculation (grammar)|grammatical ejaculation]]. Linguist Geoffrey Hughes found eight distinct usages for English curse words, and ''fuck'' can apply to each. For example, it fits in the "curse" sense ("fuck you!") as well as the "personal" sense ("You fucker"). Its vulgarity also contributes to its mostly figurative sense, though the word itself is used in its literal sense to refer to sexual intercourse, its most common usage is figurative—to indicate the speaker's strong sentiment and to offend or shock the listener.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/05/11/the_modern_history_of_swearing_where_all_the_dirtiest_words_come_from/ |date=11 May 2013 |last=Mohr |first=Melissa |title=The modern history of swearing: Where all the dirtiest words come from |accessdate=3 June 2013 |journal=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early usage==
In 2015, Dr. [[Paul Booth (historian)|Paul Booth]] claimed to have found "(possibly) the earliest known use of the word 'fuck' that clearly has a sexual connotation": in English court records of 1310–11, a man local to [[Chester]] is referred to as "[[Roger Fuckebythenavele]]", probably a nickname. "Either this refers to an inexperienced copulator, referring to someone trying to have sex with the navel, or it's a rather extravagant explanation for a dimwit, someone so stupid they think that this is the way to have sex," says Booth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Booth |authorlink=Paul Booth (historian) |title=An early fourteenth-century use of the F-word in Cheshire, 1310–11 |journal=Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire |volume=164 |year=2015 |pages=99–102}}&lt;br/&gt;

Otherwise, the usually accepted first known occurrence of the word is found in [[Code (cryptography)|code]] in a poem in a mixture of [[Latin]] and English composed in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Sheidlower1998"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Revising the F-Word |last=Sheidlower |first=Jesse |journal=Verbatim: the Language Quarterly |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=18–21 |date=Autumn 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem, which satirizes the [[Carmelite]] friars of [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]], England, takes its title, "[[Flen flyys]]", from the first words of its opening line, ''Flen, flyys, and freris'' ("Fleas, flies, and friars"). The line that contains ''fuck'' reads ''Non sunt in coeli, quia gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk''. [[Substitution cipher|Deciphering]] the phrase "''gxddbou xxkxzt pg ifmk''", here by replacing each letter by the previous letter in [[alphabetical order]], as the English alphabet was then, yields the [[macaronic]] ''non sunt in coeli, quia fuccant vvivys of heli'', which translated means, "They are not in heaven, because they fuck the women of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=fuck |title=American Heritage Dictionary definition of ''fuck'' |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was probably encoded because it accused monks of breaking their vows of celibacy;&lt;ref name="Sheidlower1998"/&gt; it is uncertain to what extent the word ''fuck'' was considered acceptable at the time. The stem of ''fuccant'' is an English word used as Latin: English [[medieval Latin]] has many examples of writers using English words when they did not know the Latin word: "''workmannus''" is an example. In the [[Middle English]] of this poem, the term ''wife'' was still used generically for "woman".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

[[William Dunbar|William Dunbar's]] 1503 poem "Brash of Wowing" includes the lines: "Yit be his feiris he wald haue fukkit: / Ye brek my hairt, my bony ane" (ll. 13–14).

The oldest occurrence of the word in adjectival form (which implies use of the verb) in English comes from the margins of a 1528 manuscript copy of [[Cicero|Cicero's]] ''[[De Officiis]]''. A monk had scrawled in the margin notes, "fuckin Abbot." Whether the monk meant the word literally, to accuse this abbott of "questionable monastic morals," or whether he used it "as an intensifier, to convey his extreme dismay" is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openculture.com/2014/02/the-very-first-written-use-of-the-f-word-in-english-1528.html |title=The Very First Written Use of the F Word in English (1528) |last1=Marshall |first1=Colin |date=February 11, 2014 |website=openculture |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Florio|John Florio's]] 1598 Italian-English dictionary, ''A Worlde of Wordes'', included the term, along with several now-archaic, but then-vulgar synonyms, in this definition:
* Fottere: ''To jape, to sard, to fucke, to swive, to occupy.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=Geoffrey |title=Fuck |journal=An Encyclopedia of Swearing: The Social History of Oaths, Profanity, Foul Language, and Ethnic Slurs in the English-Speaking World |date=2006 |url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/11/fuck.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150124223531/http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/11/fuck.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of these, "occupy" and "jape" still survive as verbs, though with less profane meanings, while "sard" was a descendant of the Anglo-Saxon verb ''seordan'' (or ''seorðan'', [[Old Norse|ON]] ''serða''), to copulate; and "swive" had derived from earlier ''swīfan'', to revolve i.e. to swivel (compare modern-day "screw"). As late as the 18th century, the verb ''occupy'' was seldom used in print because it carried sexual overtones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silverton |first=Peter |authorlink=Joe Bloggs |date=2011 |title=Filthy English: The How, Why, When And What Of Everyday Swearing |publisher=Portobello Books |location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSErq0ssG74C&amp;pg=PT25 |access-date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=occupy |work=Oxford Dictionaries |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/occupy  |accessdate=July 4, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1790 poem by [[George Tucker (politician)|George Tucker]] has a father upset with his bookish son say "I'd not give [a fuck] for all you've read". Originally printed as "I'd not give ------ for all you've read", scholars agree that the words "a fuck" were removed, making the poem the first recorded instance of the now-common phrase "I don't give a fuck".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mohr |first1=Melissa |title=Holy Shit: A Brief History of Swearing |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0199742677 |pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmer and Henley's 1893 dictionary of slang notes both the adverbial and adjectival forms of ''fuck'' as similar to but "more violent" than ''bloody'' and indicating extreme insult, respectively.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;

==Rise of modern usage==

Though it appeared in English lexicographer [[John Ash (divine)|John Ash's]] 1775 ''A New and Complete Dictionary'', listed as "low" and "vulgar," and appearing with several definitions,&lt;ref&gt;"Expletive Deleted – A good look at bad language" by Ruth Wajnryb, Copyright 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ''fuck'' did not appear in any widely consulted dictionary of the English language from 1795 to 1965. Its first appearance in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (along with the word ''cunt'') was in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/previous-updates/march-2008-update/ |title=March 2008 update |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The variant ''feck'' appeared in the ''[[English Dialect Dictionary]]'', compiled by [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Joseph |date=1900 |title=The English Dialect Dictionary: Volume 2, D-G |url=https://archive.org/stream/englishdialectdi02wrig#page/n5/mode/2up |location=Oxford |publisher=Henry Frowde |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}

The modern usage and flexibility of ''fuck'' was established by the mid to late 19th century, and has been fairly stable since.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt; Most literally, to ''fuck'' is to [[Sexual intercourse|copulate]], but it is also used as a more general [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] or intensifier. Some instances of the word can be taken at face value, such as "Let's fuck," "I would fuck her/him," or "He/she fucks." Other uses connotations that are offensive either about the subject matter or to the audience, or to both: The sexual connotation, usually connected to [[masturbation]] (in the case of "go fuck yourself" or "go fuck yourself in the ass"), is invoked to incite additional disgust, or express anger or outrage. For example, "Fuck that!", "Fuck no!", "Fuck off!", or "Fuck you!" By itself, ''fuck'' is usually used as an exclamation, indicating surprise, pain, fear, disgust, disappointment, anger, or a sense of extreme elation. In this usage, there is no connection to the sexual meaning of the word implied, and is used purely for its "strength" as a vulgarity. Additionally, other uses are similarly vacuous; ''fuck'' (or variations such as ''the fuck'' or ''fucking'') could be removed and leave a sentence of identical [[syntax|syntactical]] meaning. For example, rap music often uses the word ''fucking'' as an emphatic adjective ("I'm the fucking man") for the word's rhythmic properties. In [[British English]], to express surprise and/or disbelief towards a given statement or a question, one can say "does/is it fuck".

Insertion of the [[trochaic]] word ''fucking'' can also be used as an exercise for diagnosing the [[wikt:cadence|cadence]] of an English-language word. This is the use of ''fuck'' or more specifically ''fucking'' as an [[infix]], or more properly, a [[tmesis]] (see [[expletive infixation]]). For example, the word ''in-fucking-credible'' sounds acceptable to the English ear, and is in fairly common use, while ''incred-fucking-ible'' would sound very clumsy (though, depending on the context, this might be perceived as a humorous [[improvisation]] of the word). ''Abso-fucking-lutely'' and ''motherfucking'' are also common uses of ''fuck'' as an [[affix]]. While neither dysphemistic nor connected to the sexual connotations of the word, even the vacuous usages are considered offensive and gratuitous, and censored in some media; for example, "None of your fucking business!" or "Shut the fuck up!" A common insult is "Get fucked", which in a non-offensive context would translate as "get stuffed." The word is one of the few that has legitimate colloquial usage as a [[verb]], [[adverb]], [[adjective]], command, [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Interjection|exclamatory]], [[noun]] and [[pronoun]].

In another usage, the word ''fucker'' is used as a term of endearment rather than antipathy. This usage is not uncommon; to say "you're one smart fucker" is often a term of affection. However, because of its ambiguity and vulgarity, the word ''fucker'' in reference to another person can easily be misinterpreted. Though ''fuck'' can serve as a noun, the ''fucker'' form is used in a context that refers to an individual. Normally in these cases, if ''fuck'' is used instead of ''fucker,'' the sentence refers to the sexual ability of the subject (for example, "He's a great fuck!"), although confusingly in a minority of occasions the word "fuck" can hold exactly the same meaning as ''fucker'' (e.g., when preceded by an adjective: "You're a pretty clever fuck.").

Related to ''fucker'' is the word ''[[motherfucker]].'' Sometimes used as an extreme insult—an accusation of [[incest]]—this term is also occasionally used to connote respectful awe. For example, "He's a mean motherfucker" does not mean "He's abusive, filthy and copulates with his mother," but "He's someone to be afraid of." In this context, some people (particularly young men) might even describe themselves as "motherfuckers." In a famous example, the wallet of ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' character Jules Winnfield, played by [[Samuel L. Jackson]], is embroidered with the phrase "Bad Motherfucker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2014/05/15/video-youngstown-cop-loves-drivers-pulp-fiction-inspired-bad-motherfucker-wallet-excuses-traffic-ticket |title=Video: Youngstown Cop Loves Driver's Pulp Fiction-Inspired "Bad Motherfucker" Wallet, Excuses Traffic Ticket |author=Doug Brown |date=15 May 2014 |work=Cleveland Scene |accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''fuck'' is used in many forms of music, with ''motherfucker'' being used as a rhythmic filler in [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[urban music]] and some rock genres; examples include [[The Crystal Method]]'s song "Name of the Game" and [[Turbonegro]]'s "Don't Say Motherfucker Motherfucker". Perhaps ''motherfucker's'' rhythmic compatibility is due to its [[syllable|quadrisyllabic]] [[pronunciation]], making it a natural fit for popular music that is written in 4/4 [[Meter (music)|metre]]; a notable example of this occurs in [[Sublime (band)|Sublime's]] 1996 single "[[What I Got]]" ("I can play the guitar like / a motherfucking riot"). Also contributing to its use in aggressive, high-energy music is the fact that it includes a hard "k" sound in its third syllable, making it easy to exclaim, particularly when pronounced as "mutha fucka". Despite these rhythmic qualities, ''motherfucker'' has not become as accepted in English usage as its root ''fuck''.

The word was used to induce stress during military [[recruit training]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/library/polls/blprofanity.htm |title=Profanity in Basic Training |last= |first= |website=About.com |publisher= |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a dominant element of an English military dialect identified by [[Tom Wolfe]] as ''[[Army creole]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolfe |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Wolfe |title=The Right Stuff |publisher=Macmillan |volume= |edition= |date=2008 |location= |pages=112&amp;113 |isbn=1429961325}}&lt;/ref&gt; A succinct example of the flexibility of the word is its use as almost every word in a sentence. In his book, ''Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War'', [[Paul Fussell]], literary historian and professor emeritus of [[English literature]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], recounted&lt;blockquote&gt;Once, on a misty Scottish airfield, an [[airman]] was changing the [[ignition magneto|magneto]] on the engine of a [[Wellington bomber]]. Suddenly his wrench slipped and he flung it on the grass and snarled, "Fuck! The fucking fucker's fucked." The bystanders were all quite well aware that he had stripped a bolt and skinned his knuckles.&lt;ref&gt;Fussell P: ''Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War'', Oxford University Press, New York, NY, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the United States military air services, the nicknames applied to some aircraft included the word fucker as the letter "F" in their slang-acronyms. For instance, the [[B-52 stratofortress]] strategic bomber was often referred to as the BUFF, or Big Ugly Fat Fucker. Similarly, the [[A-7 Corsair]] was often referred to as the SLUF, or Short Little Ugly Fucker. In polite conversation, these acronyms usually substituted the word "Fellow" for fucker.

The phrase "Fuck you, you fucking fuck!" is a memorable quote from the movie ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' from 1986. Because of its vulgar status, the word ''fuck'' is usually restricted in mass media and barred from titles in the United States. In 2002, when the controversial [[Cinema of France|French film]] ''[[Baise-moi]]'' ([[2000 in film|2000]]) was released in the US, its title was changed to ''Rape Me'', rather than the literal ''Fuck Me''. Similarly, the [[Sweden|Swedish]] film ''[[Fucking Åmål]]'' was retitled ''Show Me Love''.

Online forums and public blogs may censor the word by use of [[wordfilter|automatic filters]]. For example, [[Fark.com]] replaces the word ''fuck'' with ''fark''. Others replace the word with [[asterisk]]s (''****'') to censor it (and other profanities) entirely. To avert these filters, many online posters will use the word ''fvck''. This particular alteration is in common usage at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where students use it in reference to the inscriptions on MIT's [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] buildings, in which the letter ''[[U]]'' is replaced by ''[[V]].'' A typical coinage in this idiom would be "I'm fvcked by the Institvte." (Other less common spellings to cheat a censor are "fück" and "phuck".) Another way to bypass a word filter is to use [[leet]]: fuck becomes F(_) c|&lt; or |=(_)Ck, for example.

{{anchor|WTF}}
The word ''fuck'' is a component of many acronyms, some of which—like ''[[Military acronym|SNAFU]]'' and ''[[FUBAR]]''—date as far back as [[World War II]]. Many more recent coinages, such as the shorthand "[[wikt:WTF|WTF]]?" for "what the fuck?," "[[Shut up|STFU]]" for "shut the fuck up," or "FML" for "fuck my life," have been widely extant on the Internet, and may count as examples of [[internet meme]]s. Many acronyms will also have an "F" or "MF" added to increase emphasis; for example, "OMG" ("[[wikt:oh my God|oh my God]]") becomes "OMFG" ("oh my fucking God"). Abbreviated versions of the word do not tend to be considered offensive. Although the word is proclaimed vulgar, several comedians rely on ''fuck'' for comedic routines. [[George Carlin]] created several literary works based upon the word. Other comedians who use or have used the word consistently in their routines include [[Billy Connolly]], [[Denis Leary]], [[Lewis Black]], [[Andrew Dice Clay]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Eddie Murphy]], and [[Sam Kinison]].

===Examples of more recent usage===

In 1928, English writer [[D. H. Lawrence|D. H. Lawrence's]] novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' gained notoriety for its frequent use of the words ''fuck'', ''fucked'', and ''fucking''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/22/dh-lawrence-lady-chatterley-trial "The trial of Lady Chatterley's Lover"].

''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' by [[J. D. Salinger]] featured the use of ''fuck you'' in print. First published in the United States in 1951, the novel remains controversial to this day due in part to its use of the word, standing at number 13 for the most banned books from 1990 to 2000 according to the American Library Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=bbwlinks&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=85714 |title=ALA 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000 |publisher=Ala.org |date=2009-07-20 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented use of the word ''fuck'' on live British television (and probably on any television system) has been attributed to theatre critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] in 1965, though it has been claimed Irish playwright [[Brendan Behan]] used the word on [[Panorama (TV series)|''Panorama'']] in 1956 (although no one could understand him because he was drunk) or the man who painted the railings on Stranmillis Embankment alongside the river Lagan in Belfast, who in 1959 told Ulster TV's teatime magazine programme, Roundabout, that his job was "fucking boring".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/16/tvs-five-magic-moments?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 Television's magic moments] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 16 August 2013.

[[John Cleese]] during his eulogy in the memorial service for [[Graham Chapman]] was proud to declare himself to be the first person to use the word "fuck" on such occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm2XPkqENaw |title=Graham Chapman's Memorial Service (Longer version) |date= |accessdate=2015-09-09 |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word began to break into cinema when it was uttered once in each of two 1967 British releases, ''[[Ulysses (1967 film)|Ulysses]]'' and ''[[I'll Never Forget What's'isname]]''. It was used several times in the 1969 British film ''[[Bronco Bullfrog]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/bronco-bullfrog-1969 BBFC page for Bronco Bullfrog], under "insight" section - ''LANGUAGE: Infrequent strong language ('f**k') occurs, as well as a single written use of very strong language ('c**t') which appears as graffiti on a wall.''&lt;/ref&gt; According to director [[Robert Altman]], the first time the word "fuck" was used in a major American studio film was in 1970's ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]'', spoken by Painless during the football match at the end of the film.&lt;ref&gt;''M*A*S*H'' (1970) DVD commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in politics===

''Fuck'' is not widely used in politics, and use of the word by politicians often produces controversy. Some events include:
* In 1965, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] said to the Greek ambassador [[Alexandros Matsas]] when he objected to American plans in [[Cyprus]], "Fuck your parliament and your constitution. America is an elephant. Cyprus is a flea.

===Use in marketing===

In April 1997, clothing retailer [[French Connection (clothing)|French Connection]] began branding their clothes "fcuk" (usually written in lowercase), stating it was an [[acronym]] for "French Connection United Kingdom". Its similarity to the word "fuck" caused controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1258961.stm "Time called on FCUK posters"], ''BBC News'', 4 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; French Connection produced a range of T-shirts with messages such as "fcuk this", "hot as fcuk", "mile high fcuk", "fcuk me", etc.

===Band names===

The word "fuck" has been used in a number of band names, generally based on common compounds.

===Machine mistranslation===

The word ''fuck'' occurs sometimes in Chinese/English bilingual public notices in China as a machine translation of the [[Simplified Chinese]] character [[干]] (干), which replaced the three [[Traditional Chinese]] characters 干 meaning "a pole", 幹 meaning "to do" or "to work" (and having a secondary slang meaning of "to fuck"), and 乾 meaning "dried". (Traditional Chinese 乾 can also be pronounced ''qian'', which is a [[Taoist]] stem word meaning "sky".) Some examples are "spread to fuck the fruit" for "loose dried fruit", "fuck to adjust the area" for "dry seasonings section", and "fuck the certain price of goods" for "dry foods price counter". The fault occurred in some versions of commonly used Chinese to English [[machine translators]], for example Jinshan (金山 = "Gold Mountain") by [[Kingsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005195.html |title=Language Log: The Etiology and Elaboration of a Flagrant Mistranslation |accessdate=2008-08-16 |date=December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===F-bomb===

The term "dropping an F-bomb" usually refers to the unanticipated use of the word "fuck" in an unexpected setting, such as public media, a play on the nickname for the [[hydrogen bomb]] (the "H-bomb") and the [[shock value]] that using the word "fuck" in discourse carries. The term was first reported in a newspaper ([[Newsday]]) in 1988 when Hall of Fame baseball catcher [[Gary Carter]] used it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/08/14/the_f_bomb_and_gary_carter_did_the_late_mets_catcher_invent_the_phrase_.html |title=The F-Bomb and Gary Carter: Did the late Mets catcher invent the phrase? |author= |date=2012-08-14 |work=Slate Magazine |accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was listed, for the first time, in the mainstream ''[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Italie |first=Leanne |title=F-bomb makes it into mainstream dictionary |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/13/f-bomb-makes-it-mainstream-dictionary/ |publisher=The Washington Times |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==

On August 19, 1969 the [[acid rock]] band [[Jefferson Airplane]] played their song "[[We Can Be Together]]" uncensored on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', including the 1960s countercultural slogan "Up against the wall, motherfucker!" (which was also [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers|the name of an anarchist group]] at that time). This was the first appearance of the word on U.S. television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1678 |title=We Can Be Together |publisher=Song Facts |date=1969-08-19 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "motherfucker" was also censored on the song's printed lyrics that came with the [[Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)|Volunteers album]] as "fred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Doggett |first=Peter |title=There's a Riot Going on: Revolutionaries, Rock Stars, and the Rise and Fall of the '60s |year=2009 |publisher=Canongate U.S. |isbn=978-1847671936 |page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films edited for broadcast use matching [[euphemism]]s so that [[lip synch]]ing will not be thrown off. In the film ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', [[John Goodman]]'s character repeatedly yells, "This is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass" while trashing a car. It was censored on television as "This is what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/22717626/lebowski_on_the_web |title=Lebowski on the web |author= |work= |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of expression===

In 1971, the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] decided that the public display of ''fuck'' is protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth amendments]] and cannot be made a criminal offense. In 1968, Paul Robert Cohen had been convicted of [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]] for wearing a jacket with a slogan titled "Fuck the Draft" (in a reference to conscription in the [[Vietnam War]]). The conviction was upheld by the court of appeals and overturned by the Supreme Court. ''[[Cohen v. California]]'', ''403 U.S. 15'' (1971).

==Common alternatives==
{{Main|Minced oath}}

In conversation or writing, reference to or use of the word ''fuck'' may be replaced by any of many alternative words or phrases, including "the F-word" or "the F-bomb" (a play on "[[atomic bomb|A-bomb]]" and "[[hydrogen bomb|H-bomb]]"), or simply, ''eff'' or ''f'' (as in "What the eff" or "You effing fool", "What the F" or "You f'ing fool"). Also, there are many commonly used substitutes, such as ''flipping'', ''frigging'', ''fricking'', ''freaking'', ''[[feck]]'', ''fudge'', ''flaming'' or any of a number of similar-sounding nonsense words. In print, there are alternatives such as, "F***", "F––k", etc.; or a string of non-[[alphanumeric]] characters, for example, "@$#*%!" and similar (especially favored in [[comic book]]s).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A replacement word used mainly on the Internet is "[[fsck]]", derived from the name of the Unix ''f''ile ''s''ystem ''c''hec''k''ing utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |first=David D. |last=Huff Jr. |title=Re: Mandrake 8.2 Musings |newsgroup=alt.os.linux.mandrake |year=2002 |url=https://groups.google.com/group/alt.os.linux.mandrake/msg/3641a310fcc6ed93?dmode=source |quote=At some point in your Linux career you should ask yourself: 'If there are 3.4&amp;nbsp;million successful, happy Mandrake users...what the ''fsck'' is wrong with me?' |accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' the bowdlerized form '[[Frak (expletive)|frack]]' (spelt '[[Frak (expletive)|f-r-a-k]]' in the [[Battlestar Galactica (reimagining)|reimagined 2003 version]]) was used as a substitute for fuck. The word was sometimes jokingly used as a curse by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=Associated Press |title=What the 'frak'? Faux curse seeping into language |first=Chris |last=Talbott |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/09/02/entertainment/e084605D27.DTL |date=2008-10-20}}http://archive.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/2008/09/03/20080903whatthefrak0903.html&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the word "frell" is used as a substitute on the TV show ''[[Farscape]]'', and Dr. [[Elliot Reid]] (played by [[Sarah Chalke]]) has frequently used the substitute "frick" on the TV show ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. Stu Braudy, a recurring character on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' played by [[Don Stark]], is teased by [[Larry David]] for constantly using the substitute "freak" ("Ahh, freak you!").

The phrase ''[[feck]]'' is a common substitute for ''fuck'' in Ireland, where it is considered to be less rude, though still not acceptable in many contexts. It has come into occasional use across the UK in the last 15 years as a result of its frequent use in the ''[[Father Ted]]'' comedy series. Although the word is considered to be equally as rude as ''fuck'', its appearance in ''Father Ted'' and in a [[C&amp;C Group#21st Century|Magner's Cider]] ad suggest the opposite.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29600">'''Gliosis''' is a nonspecific reactive change of [[Neuroglia|glial cells]] in response to damage to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). In most cases, gliosis involves the [[Cell growth|proliferation]] or [[Cellular adaptation#Hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] of several different types of glial cells, including [[astrocyte]]s, [[microglia]], and [[oligodendrocyte]]s. In its most extreme form, the proliferation associated with gliosis leads to the formation of a [[glial scar]].

The process of gliosis involves a series of cellular and molecular events that occur over several days.&lt;ref name="Fa"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0361-9230(99)00072-6 |pmid=10483914 |title=The glial scar and central nervous system repair |journal=Brain Research Bulletin |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=377–91 |year=1999 |last1=Fawcett |first1=James W |last2=Asher |first2=Richard.A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the first response to injury is the migration of [[macrophage]]s and local microglia to the injury site. This process, which constitutes a form of gliosis known as microgliosis, begins within hours of the initial CNS injury.&lt;ref name="Fa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Str"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0301-0082(98)00069-0 |pmid=10221782 |title=Reactive microgliosis |journal=Progress in Neurobiology |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=563–81 |year=1999 |last1=Streit |first1=Wolfgang J |last2=Walter |first2=Sharon A |last3=Pennell |first3=Nathan A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after 3–5 days, [[Oligodendrocyte progenitor|oligodendrocyte precursor cells]] are also recruited to the site and may contribute to [[remyelination]].&lt;ref name="Fa"/&gt; The final component of gliosis is [[astrogliosis]], the proliferation of surrounding astrocytes, which are the main constituents of the glial scar.

Gliosis has historically been given a negative connotation due to its appearance in many CNS diseases and the inhibition of [[Neuroregeneration|axonal regeneration]] caused by glial scar formation. However, gliosis has been shown to have both beneficial and detrimental effects, and the balance between these is due to a complex array of factors and molecular signaling mechanisms, which affect the reaction of all glial cell types.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

==Astrogliosis==
{{Main article|Astrogliosis}}
[[File:Hemangioblastoma - nse - intermed mag.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Image of gliosis in tissue|Micrograph showing gliosis in the cerebellum. Reactive astrocytes on the left display severe proliferation and domain overlap.]]

Reactive astrogliosis is the most common form of gliosis and involves the [[Cell growth|proliferation]] of [[astrocyte]]s, a type of [[Neuroglia|glial cell]] responsible for maintaining extracellular ion and [[neurotransmitter]] concentrations, modulating [[synapse]] function, and forming the [[blood–brain barrier]].&lt;ref name="Ri"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/PAP.0b013e31825c6a04 |pmid=22692287 |title=Gliosis Versus Glioma? |journal=Advances in Anatomic Pathology |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=239–49 |year=2012 |last1=Rivera-Zengotita |first1=Marie |last2=Yachnis |first2=Anthony T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other forms of gliosis, astrogliosis accompanies [[traumatic brain injury]] as well as many neuropathologies, ranging from [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]] to [[Fatal Familial Insomnia]]. Although the mechanisms which lead to astrogliosis are not fully understood, neuronal injury is well understood to cause astrocyte proliferation, and astrogliosis has long been used as an index for neuronal damage.&lt;ref name="Zh"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12035-010-8098-4 |pmid=20148316 |pmc=3629545 |title=Astrogliosis in CNS Pathologies: Is There a Role for Microglia? |journal=Molecular Neurobiology |volume=41 |issue=2–3 |pages=232–41 |year=2010 |last1=Zhang |first1=Dan |last2=Hu |first2=Xiaoming |last3=Qian |first3=Li |last4=o'Callaghan |first4=James P |last5=Hong |first5=Jau-Shyong }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, astrogliosis has been defined as an increase in [[intermediate filament]]s and cellular hypertrophy as well as an increase in the proliferation of astrocytes. Although this [[Cellular adaptation#Hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] and proliferation in their extreme form are most closely associated with the formation of a [[glial scar]], astrogliosis is not an all-or-none process in which a glial scar forms. In fact, it is a spectrum of changes that occur based on the type and severity of [[central nervous system]] (CNS) injury or disease triggering the event.&lt;ref name="S9"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2009.08.002 |pmid=19782411 |pmc=2787735 |title=Molecular dissection of reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=32 |issue=12 |pages=638–47 |year=2009 |last1=Sofroniew |first1=Michael V }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in astrocyte function or morphology which occur during astrogliosis may range from minor hypertrophy to major hypertrophy, domain overlap, and ultimately, glial scar formation.&lt;ref name="S9"/&gt; The severity of astrogliosis is classically determined by the level of expression of [[glial fibrillary acidic protein|glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)]] and [[vimentin]], both of which are [[Downregulation and upregulation|upregulated]] with the proliferation of active astrocytes.&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Si"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn1326 |pmid=14735117 |title=Regeneration beyond the glial scar |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=146–56 |year=2004 |last1=Silver |first1=Jerry |last2=Miller |first2=Jared H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modulation of astrogliosis===
Changes in astrogliosis are regulated in a context-dependent fashion, and the signaling events which dictate these changes may modify both their nature and severity.&lt;ref name="S9"/&gt; It is these changes in astrogliosis which allow the process to be complex and multifaceted, involving both a gain or loss of function as well as both beneficial and detrimental effects. Reactive astrocytes are affected by molecular signals released from a variety of CNS cell types including neurons, [[microglia]], [[Oligodendrocyte progenitor|oligodendrocyte precursor cells]], leukocytes, endothelia, and even other astrocytes. Some of the many signalling molecules used in these pathways include the [[cytokine]]s [[Interleukin 6|interleukin 6 (IL-6)]], [[Ciliary neurotrophic factor|ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)]], and [[Leukemia inhibitory factor|leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)]].&lt;ref name="S9"/&gt; Although many of these specific modulatory relationships are not yet fully understood, it is known that different specific signaling mechanisms result in different morphological and functional changes of astrocytes, allowing astrogliosis to take on a graduated spectrum of severity.&lt;ref name="S9"/&gt;

===Effects of astrogliosis===
Although astrogliosis has traditionally been viewed as a negative response inhibitory to [[Neuroregeneration|axonal regeneration]], the process is highly conserved, suggesting it has important benefits beyond its detrimental effects.&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt; Generally, the effects of astrogliosis vary with the context of the initial CNS insult and also with time after the injury. A few of the most important effects of astrogliosis are listed below.

====Beneficial effects====
*[[Neuroprotection|Neuroprotective]] effects — Reactive astrocytes release [[neurotrophic factors]], such as [[Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor|glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)]], which protects against programmed cell death
*Maintenance of the extracellular environment — Astrocytes are responsible for the uptake of [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], which restricts [[excitotoxicity]] to neurons and other cell types, as well as the elimination of [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]]&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ve"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.nurt.2010.05.017 |pmid=20880504 |pmc=5084302 |title=Astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease |journal=Neurotherapeutics |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=399–412 |year=2010 |last1=Verkhratsky |first1=Alexei |last2=Olabarria |first2=Markel |last3=Noristani |first3=Harun N |last4=Yeh |first4=Chia-Yu |last5=Rodriguez |first5=Jose Julio }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Release of [[anti-inflammatory]] molecules
*Restoration of blood brain barrier function
*Seclusion of the injury site and containment of infection from healthy tissue &lt;ref name="S9"/&gt;

====Detrimental effects====
*Restriction of axon regeneration — In cases of glial scar formation, reactive astrocytes enmesh the [[lesion]] site and deposit an inhibitory [[extracellular matrix]] consisting of [[chondroitin sulfate]] [[proteoglycan]]s. The dense structure of these proteins is a physically and chemically inhibitory barrier to axon regeneration and the reestablishment of axon connections.&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S9"/&gt;
*Secretion of [[Neurotoxicity|neurotoxic]] substances — These may include [[Proinflammatory cytokine|pro-inflammatory]] and [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] [[cytokine]]s. Examples of these molecules include [[nitric oxide]] radicals and [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF-α]].&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt;
*Release of excitotoxic glutamate&lt;ref name="S9"/&gt;
*Hindrance of functional recovery and worsening of [[Medical sign|clinical signs]]&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S9"/&gt;

==Microgliosis==
Microglia, another type of glial cell, act as macrophage-like cells in the CNS when activated. Unlike other glial cell types, microglia are extremely sensitive to even small changes in the cellular environment, allowing for a rapid response to inflammatory signals and prompt destruction of infectious agents before sensitive neural tissue can be damaged.&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt; Due to their fast response time, microgliosis, or the activation of microglia, is commonly the first observed stage of gliosis.

Microgliosis following a CNS insult most commonly involves the development of an altered cellular morphology, specifically the enlargement of cellular processes.&lt;ref name="Str"/&gt; The microglial immunological surface [[Macrophage-1 antigen|receptor CR3]] is also upregulated within 24 hours after the initial injury. Within the first week following the injury, microglia begin to proliferate abnormally and while doing so exhibit several [[Immunophenotyping|immunophenotypic]] changes, particularly an increased expression of [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC antigens]].&lt;ref name="Str"/&gt; The population of activated microglia at the site of a CNS injury includes not only endogenous microglia of the CNS but also exogeneous [[Pericyte|perivascular cells]] originating in the [[bone marrow]] that migrate to the area and transform into microglia to supplement the microgliosis response.&lt;ref name="Wi"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jnr.20659 |pmid=16237722 |title=Reactive microgliosis engages distinct responses by microglial subpopulations after minor central nervous system injury |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Research |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=507–14 |year=2005 |last1=Wirenfeldt |first1=Martin |last2=Babcock |first2=Alicia Anne |last3=Ladeby |first3=Rune |last4=Lambertsen |first4=Kate Lykke |last5=Dagnaes-Hansen |first5=Frederik |last6=Leslie |first6=Robert Graham Quinton |last7=Owens |first7=Trevor |last8=Finsen |first8=Bente }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in their activated state, microglia may serve a variety of beneficial functions. For example, active microglia are the primary effectors of [[Innate immune system|innate immunity]] and fulfill this role by [[Phagocytosis|phagocyting]] the proteins of dead neurons, presenting [[antigen]]s at their surface, and producing a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and toxic molecules that compromise the survival of surrounding neurons which may be similarly damaged or infected.&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt; Active microglia also perform critical [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] activity, including the clearing of cell debris through phagocytosis, a function essential to neuron survival.&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt; In addition, active microglia release anti-inflammatory factors and other molecules, such as IL-6 and [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-β]], which regulate [[neurogenesis]] after injury.&lt;ref name="Str"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt; However, the over-activation of microglia can also be detrimental by producing several neurotoxic substances including pro-inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α, [[prostaglandin E2]], and [[Interferon-gamma|interferon-γ]], and [[oxidative stress]] factors, including nitric oxide and [[hydrogen peroxide]].&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt; Notably, unlike astrogliosis, microgliosis is a temporary and self-limited event, which generally lasts only one month after injury, even in cases of extreme damage.&lt;ref name="Str"/&gt;

===Neural modulation of microgliosis===
Microglial activation has been shown to be a reactive process in which microglia respond to signals given off by injured neurons. Because various characteristics of microgliosis occur in different time frames after the initial triggering insult, microgliosis must depend on mechanisms which fluctuate temporally based on injured neuronal signals. Studies have shown that in cases of reversible neuronal injury, such as [[axotomy]], neuron signals cause microglia to produce trophic factors, which promote neuron survival. In cases of irreversible injury, however, microglia are induced to release neurotoxic factors that promote increased [[Neurodegeneration|degeneration]] of the neuron and more rapid phagocytosis by the microglia.&lt;ref name="Str"/&gt; Such specificity of the process of microgliosis indicates that it primarily serves a beneficial purpose, selectively conserving some neural tissue while eliminating others, based on the specific initial CNS insult.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

===Microglial regulation of astrogliosis===
Although the molecular triggers of gliosis, including both astrogliosis and microgliosis, are not fully understood, in vitro studies have indicated that activated microglia have an important role in initiating and modulating astrogliosis.&lt;ref name="Roh"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.10.057 |pmid=17169340 |title=The effect of activated microglia on astrogliosis parameters in astrocyte cultures |journal=Brain Research |volume=1129 |issue=1 |pages=43–52 |year=2007 |last1=Röhl |first1=Claudia |last2=Lucius |first2=Ralph |last3=Sievers |first3=Jobst }}&lt;/ref&gt; One critical piece of evidence supporting this relationship is the widely documented temporal correlation between the onsets of the two processes. Unlike the microglial response, which occurs rapidly, the start of astrogliosis is often delayed. A likely cause of this relationship is the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released at elevated levels by microglia upon activation. These include [[Macrophage inflammatory protein|macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP)]], [[Macrophage colony-stimulating factor|macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)]], the interleukins [[Interleukin 1 family|IL-1]], IL-6, and [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]], and TNF-α.&lt;ref name="Ba"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-510X(95)00209-K |pmid=8847546 |title=The microglial cell. A historical review |journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences |volume=134 |pages=57–68 |year=1995 |last1=Barron |first1=Kevin D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Receptors for these molecules have been identified on astrocytes, and the molecules, when exogenously introduced, have been shown to induce, enhance, or accompany astrogliosis. Astrocytes themselves also produce cytokines, which may be used for self-regulation or for the regulation of microglia, which contain similar cytokine receptors. This phenomenon creates a [[Feedback|feedback loop]], allowing both microglia and astrocytes to regulate one another. In addition, evidence suggests microglial regulation of astrogliosis may also include inhibitory effects. Reduced levels of microgliosis have been associated with reduced astrocyte numbers, which also suggests that microglia are important regulators of the degree of astrocyte activation.&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt;

==Response of oligodendrocytes==

[[Oligodendrocytes]] are another type of glial cell which generate and maintain the formation of [[myelin]] around the [[axon]]s of large neurons in the CNS, allowing for rapid transmission of neural signals. Unlike astrocytes and microglia, oligodendrocytes undergo a much more limited reaction to injury.&lt;ref name="Ri"/&gt; Rather, in cases of CNS trauma, they are more similar to neurons in their susceptibility to sustaining damage.&lt;ref name="Str"/&gt; The degeneration of axons as a result of trauma or pathology invariably results in the degeneration of the myelin sheath.&lt;ref name="Fa"/&gt; Depending on the mechanism of insult, several different patterns of oligodendrocyte injury and reaction may be observed. In all cases, however, some oligodendrocytes are lost, through [[necrosis]] or [[apoptosis]], while others survive and may form part of the glial scar along with myelin debris.&lt;ref name="Fa"/&gt; Oligodendrocyte precursor cells are also affected by CNS insult and are recruited to demyelinated areas within a week following traumatic injury. Some of these cells may produce new myelin when exposed to signals from activated microglia and astrocytes.&lt;ref name="Br"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00401-009-0601-5 |pmid=19847447 |pmc=2799635 |title=Oligodendrocytes: Biology and pathology |journal=Acta Neuropathologica |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=37–53 |year=2009 |last1=Bradl |first1=Monika |last2=Lassmann |first2=Hans }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triggers of gliosis==
In general after any CNS insult, gliosis begins after the blood brain barrier is disrupted, allowing non-CNS molecules, such as blood and [[Serum (blood)|serum]] components, to enter the brain.&lt;ref name="Si"/&gt; These components, along with activated [[macrophages]] they carry, are known to have a role in beginning the formation of the glial scar by inducing the disconnection of axons, also called secondary axotomy, and the upregulation of fibrous extracellular matrix components which eventually form the scar tissue.&lt;ref name="Si"/&gt; The specific molecular triggers responsible for this action, however, remain unknown. One potential trigger is transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). [[TGF beta 2|TGF-β2]], whose expression is gradually increased as gliosis occurs, has been shown to increase astrocyte production of scar-forming proteoglycans. Experimental reduction of both TGF-β2 and [[TGF beta 1|TGF-β1]], which is expressed immediately after injury, has resulted in reduced glial scarring.&lt;ref name="Si"/&gt; The interleukins are another potential molecular trigger of gliosis. These molecules, notably IL-1, initiate an inflammatory response in various cells including astrocytes that contributes to the gliosis reaction.&lt;ref name="Si"/&gt; Finally, interactions between the inflammatory cytokines [[Interferon-gamma|interferon-γ (IFN-γ)]] and [[Basic fibroblast growth factor|fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)]] may also be responsible for the induction of gliosis. In culture, both molecules act as [[mitogen]]s, prompting the proliferation of astrocytes.&lt;ref name="Di"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/exnr.1997.6700 |pmid=9417838 |title=Inflammatory Cytokines Interact to Modulate Extracellular Matrix and Astrocytic Support of Neurite Outgrowth |journal=Experimental Neurology |volume=148 |issue=2 |pages=628–39 |year=1997 |last1=Diprospero |first1=Nicholas A |last2=Meiners |first2=Sally |last3=Geller |first3=Herbert M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, addition of IFN-γ to brain legion sites has resulted in an increase in glial scarring.&lt;ref name="Si"/&gt;

==Gliosis in CNS injury and disease==
Gliosis is the universal response of the CNS to tissue injury and occurs as a result of many acute conditions such as trauma, [[ischemia]], and [[stroke]]. Additionally, gliosis is present in a wide variety of CNS pathologies, including [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Korsakoff's syndrome]], [[multiple system atrophy]], [[prion disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[AIDS dementia complex]], [[vasculitis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]], and [[Huntington's disease]].&lt;ref name=McMillan&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(94)90086-8 |pmid=7517589 |title=Brain injury in a dish: A model for reactive gliosis |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=138–42 |year=1994 |last1=McMillian |first1=Michael K |last2=Thai |first2=Linda |last3=Hong |first3=J-S |last4=O'Callaghan |first4=James P |last5=Pennypacker |first5=Keith R }}&lt;/ref&gt; In every case, gliosis involves some degree of hypertrophy or proliferation of glial cells, but the extent and nature of the gliosis response vary widely based on the triggering insult. Gliosis in any form entails an alteration in cellular activity that has the potential to create widespread effects on neurons as well as other non-neural cells, causing either a loss of normal functions or a gain of detrimental ones.&lt;ref name="S1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00401-009-0619-8 |pmid=20012068 |pmc=2799634 |title=Astrocytes: Biology and pathology |journal=Acta Neuropathologica |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=7–35 |year=2009 |last1=Sofroniew |first1=Michael V |last2=Vinters |first2=Harry V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ha"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.nurt.2010.07.003 |pmid=20880511 |pmc=2952540 |title=Reactive astrocytes as therapeutic targets for CNS disorders |journal=Neurotherapeutics |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=494–506 |year=2010 |last1=Hamby |first1=Mary E |last2=Sofroniew |first2=Michael V }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this light, gliosis may be seen not only as a characteristic of many neuropathologies but as a potential contributor to, or even cause of, many CNS disease mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Ha"/&gt; A select group of CNS conditions associated with gliosis are described below.

===CNS trauma===
Acute trauma to the [[brain]] or [[spinal cord]] results in gliosis, most often in its severe form with the development of a glial scar. Different locations around the lesion site may exhibit different severities of gliosis; for example, a glial scar at the location of damaged tissue may be surrounded by areas with less severe astrocyte proliferation or hypertrophy. Diffuse traumatic injury can result in diffuse or more moderate gliosis without scar formation. In such cases, gliosis may also be reversible. In all instances of gliosis resulting from CNS trauma, the long-term clinical outcome is highly dependent on the degree of astrogliosis and scar formation.&lt;ref name="S1"/&gt;

===Multiple sclerosis and autoimmune inflammatory disorders===
Gliosis is a prominent feature of many [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] inflammatory disorders, notably [[multiple sclerosis]], in which demyelinated plaques are surrounded by reactive astrocytes. These astrocytes often exhibit extreme hypertrophy and multiple distinct [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]], and their production of pro-inflammatory molecules has been implicated in several inflammatory disorders.&lt;ref name="S1"/&gt; Cytokines produced by both active astrocytes and microglia in inflammatory conditions may contribute to myelin damage and may alter blood-brain barrier permeability, allowing the migration of [[lymphocyte]]s into the CNS and heightening the autoimmune attack.&lt;ref name="Ba"/&gt;

===Retinal Gliosis===
In vertebrates, the retina contains Müller cells, a type of glia not found elsewhere in the CNS. Upon retinal injury, gliosis of these cells occurs, functioning to repair damage, but often having harmful consequences in the process, worsening some of the diseases or problems that initially trigger it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/78774 |pmid=10966617 |title=Control of Müller glial cell proliferation and activation followingretinal injury |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=873–80 |year=2000 |last1=Dyer |first1=Michael A |last2=Cepko |first2=Constance L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactive gliosis in the retina can have detrimental effects on vision; in particular, the production of proteases by astrocytes causes widespread death of retinal ganglion cells. A 2011 study compared the effects of two glial toxins, AAA and Neurostatin, on retinal gliosis in mice. AAA did not inhibit the production of protease by astrocytes, and so did not prevent ganglion cell apoptosis. However, Neurostatin successfully inhibited activation of astrocytes, in turn decreasing retinal ganglion cell death significantly. Neurostatin is also effective in the inhibition of other glial cells, and may be an area of interest in the treatment of degenerative diseases such as glaucoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0018305 |pmid=21483783 |pmc=3069086 |title=Inhibition of Reactive Gliosis Attenuates Excitotoxicity-Mediated Death of Retinal Ganglion Cells |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=e18305 |year=2011 |last1=Ganesh |first1=Bhagyalaxmi S |last2=Chintala |first2=Shravan K |bibcode=2011PLoSO...618305G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Massive retinal gliosis (MRG) is a phenomenon in which the retina is completely replaced by proliferation of glial cells, causing deterioration of vision and even blindness in some cases. Sometimes mistaken for an intraocular tumor, MRG can arise from a neurodegenerative disease, congenital defect, or from trauma to the eyeball, sometimes appearing years after such an incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0301-4738.81050 |pmid=21586853 |pmc=3120251 |title=Massive retinal gliosis: An unusual case with immunohistochemical study |journal=Indian Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=246–8 |year=2011 |last1=Deshmukh |first1=Sanjayd |last2=Ashturkar |first2=Amrutv |last3=Babanagare |first3=Shridharv |last4=Gokhale |first4=Suvarnak |last5=Deshpande |first5=Ananda }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ali |first1=Zafar |first2=Muhammed |last2=Atique |title=Massive Retinal Gliosis: A Rare Entity |journal=The Annals of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences  |volume=8 |issue=2 |year=2012 |pages=152–3 |url=http://apims.net/apims_old/Volumes/Vol8-2/Massive%20Retinal%20Gliosis%20A%20Rare%20Entity.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alzheimer's Disease===
Gliosis has long been known as a characteristic of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), although its exact role in the disease remains unknown. Gliosis and glial scarring occur in areas surrounding the [[Amyloid|amyloid plaques]] which are hallmarks of the disease, and postmortem tissues have indicated a correlation between the degree of astrogliosis and cognitive decline.&lt;ref name="Ve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S1"/&gt; Exposure of reactive astrocytes to [[Beta amyloid|β-amyloid (Αβ)]] peptide, the main component of amyloid plaques, may also induce astroglial dysfunction and neurotoxicity. In addition, the ability of reactive astrocytes to degrade extracellular Αβ deposits may suggest that astrogliosis may affect the progression or severity of AD.&lt;ref name="S1"/&gt;

===Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis===
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a debilitating disease involving the degeneration of [[motor neuron]]s in the CNS. Reactive astrocytes have been implicated in this condition through either a loss of their neuroprotective ability or through the gain of neurotoxic effects. Late stages of ALS are also characterized by significant astrogliosis and astrocyte proliferation around areas of degeneration.&lt;ref name="Ve"/&gt;

==Potential therapeutic targets in gliosis==
The implications of gliosis in various neuropathologies and injury conditions has led to the investigation of various therapeutic routes which would regulate specific aspects of gliosis in order to improve clinical outcomes for both CNS trauma and a wide range of neurological disorders. Because gliosis is a dynamic process which involves a spectrum of changes depending on the type and severity of the initial insult, to date, no single molecular target has been identified which could improve healing in all injury contexts. Rather, therapeutic strategies for minimizing the contribution of astrogliosis to CNS pathologies must be designed to target specific molecular pathways and responses. One promising therapeutic mechanism is the use of [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|β-lactam antibiotics]] to enhance the glutamate uptake of astrocytes in order to reduce excitotoxicity and provide neuroprotection in models of stroke and ALS. Other proposed targets related to astrogliosis include manipulating [[Aquaporin 4|AQP4]] channels, diminishing the action of [[NF-kB]], or regulating the [[STAT3]] pathway in order to reduce the inflammatory effects of reactive astrocytes.&lt;ref name="S9"/&gt; Astrogliosis may also be attenuated by inhibiting the microgliosis response. One notable microglial activation inhibitor is [[minocycline]], which is a known suppressor of astrogliosis.&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt; The cell cycle inhibitor [[Glial scar#Olomoucine|olomoucine]] also has been shown to suppress both microglial and astroglial proliferation as well as glial scar formation.&lt;ref name="Zh"/&gt; Future directions for identifying novel therapeutic strategies must carefully account for the complex array of factors and signaling mechanisms driving the gliosis response, particularly in different stages after damage and in different lesion conditions.&lt;ref name="Bu"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2009.09.014 |pmid=19765548 |title=Astrocytes in the damaged brain: Molecular and cellular insights into their reactive response and healing potential |journal=Biochemical Pharmacology |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=77–89 |year=2010 |last1=Buffo |first1=Annalisa |last2=Rolando |first2=Chiara |last3=Ceruti |first3=Stefania }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hari Krishna Devsare''' ({{IPA-hns|ɦəri ˈkr̩ʂɳə d̪eʋsre|hi}}; 9 March 1938 – 14 November 2013) was a [[Hindi language|Hindi]] writer, known for his work in the field of [[children's literature]]. He received the first Vatsalya Award, instituted by Padma Binani Foundation, for his contribution to children's literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Briefly (Sealing responsible for Congress defeat)|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/briefly/article1825200.ece |date=8 April 2007|accessdate=14 November 2013|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2011, he was honoured with Life Time Contribution Award in the field of Children's Literature by Sahitya Akademi, the Indian Academy of Letters.

==Early life==
Devsare was born on 9 March 1938 in [[Nagod]], [[Madhya Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="timesofindia" /&gt;

==Work==
Known for experimentation in his writings, Dr Devsare had launched a serious debate by questioning the relevance of the tales of kings and queens and fairies in the modern context. Instead, he has encouraged creativity in children's literature in Indian languages and tried to fill the vacuum in science fiction and one-act plays for children. With over 300 books for children to his credit, he has contributed a number of authentic and standard works in this category in Hindi. In addition, he has written scripts for serials, telefilms and programmes based on science and technology. Dr Devsare was a recipient of several awards and honours, including Bal Sahityakar Samman, Bal Sahitya Samman of Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sansthan, Kriti Samman (2001) and Sahityakar Samman (2004) of Hindi Akademi, Delhi.

Devsare worked for 22&amp;nbsp;years in [[All India Radio]] and after with voluntary retirement he started working with Parag magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=जानेमाने साहित्यकार हरिकृष्ण देवसरे का निधन|trans-title=Noted author Hari Krishna Devsre died|url=http://abpnews.newsbullet.in/ind/34-more/59554-2013-11-14-14-18-03|publisher=ABP News|date=14 November 2013|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Hindi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the editor of Hindi magazine ''[[Parag (magazine)|Parag]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H K Devsare wins first 'Vatsalya Award' for children's literature|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2007/02/08/h-k-devsare-wins-first-vatsalya-award-for-childrens-literature-1170938517.html|publisher=[[Oneindia]]|date=8 February 2007|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote several books in Hindi in different genres, including mystery, adventure and science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Once there was a story|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/once-there-was-a-story/article653000.ece|publisher=The Hindu|date=12 February 2009|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Devsare died on 14 November 2013 in [[Indirapuram]], [[Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="timesofindia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prominent Hindi writer Hari Krishna Devsare dies in Ghaziabad|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Prominent-Hindi-writer-Hari-Krishna-Devsare-dies-in-Ghaziabad/articleshow/25770221.cms|author=|date=14 November 2013|accessdate=14 November 2013|publisher=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hindi author Devsare dies|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/hindi-author-devsare-dies-113111400999_1.html|publisher=Business Standard|date=14 November 2013|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devsare is survived by his wife Vibha Devsare, two sons, a daughter and five grandchildren.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2541">The '''''Harley Glossary''''' is an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[glossary]], mostly providing glosses on [[Latin language|Latin]] words. It mostly survives in the fragmentary British Library, MS Harley 3376, but fragments are also found in Lawrence, University of Kansas, Kenneth Spenser Research Library, Pryce P2 A: 1, and Oxford, Bodleian Library, Lat. Misc. a. 3., fol. 49. The manuscript was produced in western England in the eleventh century, and has been argued to have been produced at [[Worcester Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Cooke, ‘Worcester Books and Scholars, and the Making of the Harley Glossary: British Library MS. Harley 3376’, ''Anglia'', 115 (1997), 441–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

About two thirds of the glosses are themselves in Latin, while about a third are in [[Old English language|Old English]]. In the assessment of Jessica Cooke, 'it appears that the compiler wished to emphasise the Latin element of his work as opposed to the vernacular, and wrote the Latin words in large letters on the ruled lines of the pages, while according the English a lower status in smaller writing between the lines. In addition, he reversed the usual trend by re-translating some Old English glosses from his exemplars back into Latin’.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Cooke, ‘Worcester Books and Scholars, and the Making of the Harley Glossary: British Library MS. Harley 3376’, ''Anglia'', 115 (1997), 441–68 (p. 454-55).&lt;/ref&gt; Cooke found that about half the entries in the glossary derive from earlier Anglo-Saxon glossaries, with the closest parallels being afforded by the [[Corpus Glossary]] of c. 800 and the [[Cleopatra Glossaries]] of the tenth century:&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Cooke, ‘Worcester Books and Scholars, and the Making of the Harley Glossary: British Library MS. Harley 3376’, ''Anglia'', 115 (1997), 441–68 (p. 456-57).&lt;/ref&gt; about two third of the material in the latter appears in the Harley Glossary.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Pulsiano, ‘Prayers, Glosses and Glossaries’, in ''A Companion to Anglo-Saxon Literature'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano and Elaine Treharne (Oxford, 2001), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
The principal edition is Jessica Cooke, ‘The Harley Manuscript 3376: A Study in Anglo-Saxon Glossography’ (Unpublished PhD thesis, Cambridge, 1994). An earlier edition is ''The Harley Latin-Old English Glossary Edited from British Museum MS Harley 3376'', ed. by Robert T. Oliphant, Janua Linguarum, Series Practica 20 (The Hague: Mouton, 1966).

'''Helvetisms''' ([[New Latin]] ''[[Helvetia]]'' "[[Switzerland]]" and ''[[:wikt:-ism|-ism]]'') are features distinctive of [[Swiss Standard German]], that distinguish it from [[Standard German]]. The most frequent Helvetisms are in [[vocabulary]] and [[pronunciation]], but there are also some distinctive features within [[syntax]] and [[orthography]].

The [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] spoken in Switzerland have similar terms, which are also known as Helvetisms. Current French dictionaries, such as the [[Petit Larousse]], include several hundred helvetisms.&lt;ref name="Clyne1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael G. Clyne|title=Pluricentric Languages: Differing Norms in Different Nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wawGFWNuHiwC&amp;pg=PA164|accessdate=7 September 2013|year=1992|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-012855-0|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The definitive work for German orthography, the [[Duden]], explicitly declares a number of helvetisms as correct Standard German – albeit with the ''[schweiz.]'' annotation, denoting that the usage of the word is limited to Switzerland. However, not all words may be considered part of the "Swiss standard language"/"Swiss standard German" category, because frequency of usage must be evaluated as well; if this does not apply, or if a word's use is known to span only one or more specific dialectal regions, the word must be categorized "dialectal" (German: ''mundartlich'', often abbreviated ''mdal.'')

In orthographical terms, the most significant difference to Standard German outside Switzerland is the absence of ''[[ß]]'' (eszett). (After having been officially abandoned in the [[Canton of Zürich]] in 1935, this character gradually fell into disuse, until it was eventually dropped by the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'' in 1974.)

In everyday language, Helvetisms may be used both consciously and unconsciously by a Swiss German native speaker. Classic examples of Helvetism usage throughout entire literary works are found in a large part of Swiss literature, notably [[Jeremias Gotthelf]]'s novels located in the [[Emmental]]; a contemporary example would be [[Tim Krohn]] in his ''Quatemberkinder''. Another group, the most notable of whom is [[Peter Bichsel]], deliberately use Helvetisms to arouse a sort of emotional attachment to the readers' home country: Bichsel is notorious for using dialectal words like ''Beiz'' (instead of ''Kneipe'' [English: "pub"]), or ''Kasten'' (instead of ''Schrank'' [English: "cupboard/cabinet/closet"]) in his "San Salvador" short story. Lastly, there is yet another group of authors whose readers are known to be located all over the German-speaking territory (Germany, Austria, Switzerland as well as some smaller minorities in other European countries) and therefore traditionally refrain from using any Helvetisms in their literary works.

In addition, words which are used outside Switzerland, but which  originate from Swiss German may be called "Helvetisms".

Analogously to "Helvetisms", there are also Austricisms and [[Germanism (linguistics)|Germanisms]] (also ''Teutonicisms'').

== Pronunciation ==
{{main|Swiss German|Swiss Standard German}}
Because of their characteristic pronunciation, speakers of Swiss Standard German will be instantly recognized by other German speakers in most cases.

In general, the pronunciation of Swiss Standard German is influenced by the respective Swiss German dialect of each speaker. The degree of that influence may vary according to their education.

===Differing pronunciation===
In Switzerland some words are stressed on different syllables from in the rest of the German-speaking area (marked with an accent here):
*Family names that have a [[preposition]] are always accentuated on the preposition, even when those names are written with a space between the preposition and the rest of the name. For example, in [[Michael von Grünigen]].
*[[Acronyms]] like CD, WC, FDP etc. are not stressed on the last, but on the first letter. (like this: CéDe, WéZe, éffdeepee)
*A lot of foreign words from different languages are stressed on the first syllable, e.g. ''Ásphalt'', ''Ápostroph'', ''Bíllet'', ''Búdget'', ''Fílet'', ''Gárage'', ''Lábor'', ''Pápagei'', ''Pénalty'', ''Pórtemonnaie''.

===Consonants===
*/b d g z/ are voiceless [[lenis|lenes]] {{IPA|[b̥ d̥ ɡ̊ z̥]}}
*There is no [[final-obstruent devoicing]].
*/v/ is pronounced as an [[approximant]] {{IPA|[ʋ]}}; in some words, it is replaced by a voiceless lenis {{IPA|[v̥]}}, e.g. in ''Möve'' or ''Advent''.
*Double consonants are often [[gemination|geminated]], e.g. ''immer'' as {{IPA|[ˈɪmːər]}}.
*Initial {{angbr|ch}} is pronounced as a {{IPA|[x]}}, for instance in local names like [[Chur]] and [[Cham ZG|Cham]] or in foreign words like ''China'' or ''Chemie'', ''Chirurgie'' etc.
*The ending {{angbr|-ig}} is pronounced {{IPA|[-ɪɡ̊]}}, not {{IPA|[-ɪç]}}, e.g. ''König'' {{IPA|[køːnɪɡ̊]}} 'king'
*{{angbr|chs}} is pronounced [xs] or [çs], not [ks], e.g. ''Dachs'' as [daxs] or ''sechs'' as {{IPA|[z̥ɛçs]}} 'six'.
*{{angbr|r}} is not vocalized (that is, SSG is [[Rhoticity in German|rhotic]]). In Switzerland, ''Vater'' 'father' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈfaːtər]}} and not {{IPA|[ˈfaːtɐ]}}.
*In Switzerland (except the eastern part and Basel-Stadt) the alveolar {{IPA|[r]}} is more usual than the uvular {{IPA|[ʀ]}}.
*There is often no [[glottal stop]] which in other varieties of German is present at start of vowel-initial words.
*For some speakers, {{IPA|/x/}} is always pronounced as {{IPA|[x]}}, and not differentiated into [x] and [ç], e.g. in ''nicht'' {{IPA|[nɪxt]}} instead of {{IPA|[nɪçt]}} 'not'.
*For some speakers, {{IPA|/k/}} is pronounced as velar [[affricate]] {{IPA|[k͡x]}}, e.g. ''Kunst'' {{IPA|[k͡xʊnst]}}.
*For a few, {{IPA|/st sp/}} are pronounced {{IPA|[ʃt ʃp]}} instead of {{IPA|[st sp]}} in all positions, and not only at the beginning of a word stem, e.g. ''Ast'' as {{IPA|[aʃt]}} 'branch'.

===Vowels===
*Unstressed {{angbr|e}} is often not pronounced as [[schwa]], but as {{IPA|[e]}} or {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, e.g. ''Gedanke'' {{IPA|[ɡ̊ɛˈd̥aŋkɛ]}} or {{IPA|[ɡ̊eˈd̥aŋke]}} 'thought'.
*{{angbr|ä}} is usually pronounced as an open {{IPA|[æ]}} like in English "hat", "patch".
*Depending on the dialect, {{angbr|a}} may be pronounced as a back {{IPA|[ɑ]}}).
*Depending on the dialect, short vowels may be pronounced more closed, e.g. ''Bett'' {{IPA|[b̥et]}} instead of {{IPA|[b̥ɛt]}} 'bed', ''offen'' {{IPA|[ˈofən]}} instead of {{IPA|[ˈɔfən]}} 'open', ''Hölle'' {{IPA|[hølːe]}} instead of {{IPA|[ˈhœlːe]}} 'hell'.
*Depending on the dialect, long vowels may be pronounced more open, e.g. ''See'' {{IPA|[z̥ɛː]}} instead of {{IPA|[ˈz̥eː]}} 'lake', ''schon'' {{IPA|[ʃɔːn]}} instead of {{IPA|[ʃoːn]}} 'already', ''schön'' {{IPA|[ʃœːn]}} instead of {{IPA|[ʃøːn]}} 'beautiful'.

===Prosody===
A special feature of Swiss Standard German, is a somewhat "singing" cadence. That means that each word's stressed syllable isn't only marked through the higher voice volume, but also through a distinguishable modification of the voice's sound. In general, the pitch of the stressed syllable sinks.

*In the word ''Merci'' ("thanks!"), the first syllable is spoken louder and deeper than the second.
*In the announcement ''Profitieren Sie!'' (Benefit!) in the shopping malls' transmissions, the pitch sinks from ''pro-'' to ''-fi-'', until it has reached the deepest point at ''-tie-''; at ''-ren'' and ''Sie'' the voice approximately reaches its original pitch again.

==Orthography==
In orthography, the most visible difference from Standard German usage outside Switzerland is the absence of ''[[ß]]'' (officially abolished in the [[Canton of Zürich]] in 1935; the sign fell gradually out of use and was dropped by the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'' (''NZZ'') in 1974).

French and Italian [[loanword]]s are written in their original forms – despite the spelling reform. ''Majonäse'' stays ''Mayonnaise'', and ''Spagetti'' stays ''Spaghetti''. The ''NZZ'' has even chosen the word ''placieren'', to not have to write ''platzieren''.

Geographical names, such as streets, are mostly written together: ''Baslerstrasse'', ''Genfersee'', ''Zugerberg'' etc., but also ''Schweizergrenze'', ''Schweizervolk'' (very often).

[[Umlaut (diacritic)|Umlaut]]s on the first letter of Swiss proper names are written as &lt;Ae&gt;, &lt;Oe&gt; and &lt;Ue&gt;: ''[[Aebi]]'', ''[[Oerlikon (Zürich)|Oerlikon]]'', ''[[Uetliberg]]'' (pronounced Üetliberg, not Ütliberg).

Finally, there are specialities like e.g.
*''Bretzel'' instead of ''Brezel'' ("[[pretzel]]")

Some of the above-mentioned characteristics are due to the general introduction of the [[typewriter]] in economics and administration. Because a Swiss typewriter must be able to write not only German texts but also French and Italian texts, the limited number of keys wasn't enough for all these languages' special characters to be included. So, the [[eszett]] and the uppercase umlauts (''Ä'', ''Ö'' and ''Ü''), as well as other upper-case accented vowels (e.g. ''À'' or ''É''), were missed out.

==Syntax==
Swiss German differs from Standard German in, for example, the gender of nouns ('''''das''' E-Mail'', '''''das''' Tram'' and '''''das''' SMS'' instead of ''die'') or in the preposotion that verbs require (''jemanden anfragen'' instead of ''bei jemandem anfragen'').

In general, more often than in Germany or Austria, the Swiss use '''female descriptions of professions''' instead of using a [[generic masculine]] (''Bundesrätin [[Ruth Metzler]]'', ''Frieda U. wurde zur Primarschullehrerin gewählt''). The ''Binnen-I'' (as in ''ProfessorIn'') is not used only by "politically correct" people.

'''[[Relative pronouns]]''': The relative pronoun ''welche(r)'', considered clumsy and antiquated in Standard German, is used without hesitation: in ''Damit wurde in der Schweiz ein Kompetenzzentrum für Klimafragen geschaffen, '''welches''' verstärkt die Bedürfnisse der Bevölkerung in den Mittelpunkt ihrer Forschung stellt.'' (from [http://old.cc.ethz.ch/publikationen/jb2001/d/notabene/index.htm Jahresbericht 2001], Annual report of the [[Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich|ETH Zürich]]).

=== Grammatical case  ===
''[[Rabatt]]'' is used in the [[dative case]]; in Standard German in the [[accusative case]]. Example: ''20% Rabatt auf allen Artikeln''.

=== Sentence structure ===
The syntax has a lot of constructions with a shortened main clause and a following subordinate clause, which is only marked by the initial position of a verb, e.g.
*''Gut, gibt es Schweizer Bauern.'' instead of ''Es ist gut, dass es Schweizer Bauern gibt.''
*''Schön, haben Sie heute Zeit.'' instead of ''(Es ist) schön, dass Sie heute Zeit haben.''
*''Schade, bist du gestern nicht hier gewesen.'' instead of ''(Es ist) schade, dass du gestern nicht hier gewesen bist.''

==Grammatical gender==
In his book ''[[Zündels Abgang]]'', author [[Markus Werner]] uses ''Tram'' ("tram") – which takes the female article ''die'' in Germany's Standard German – with the typically Swiss neuter article ''das''.

== Swiss expressions loaned into Standard German==
The word [[Coup d'état#Putsch|''Putsch'']] is one example which is widely used in political contexts, even in notable Standard German newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwds.de/?view=1&amp;qu=Putsch Etymology and definition of ''Putsch''] in German&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryZurich&gt;{{cite book | title = Kleine Zürcher Verfassungsgeschichte 1218–2000 | language = German | url = http://www.staatsarchiv.zh.ch/internet/justiz_inneres/sta/de/ueber_uns/veroeffentlichungen/_jcr_content/contentPar/downloadlist_1/downloaditems/download_stark_reduz.spooler.download.1282812455918.pdf/zh_verfassungsgeschichte.pdf | publisher = [[:de:Staatsarchiv des Kantons Zürich|State Archives of the Canton of Zurich]] | location = Zurich | page = 51 | date = September 13, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Etymology&gt;{{cite book | author = [[:de:Wolfgang Pfeifer (Etymologe)|Pfeifer, Wolfgang]] | title = Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Deutschen | trans-title = Etymological Dictionary of German | language = German | publisher = [[Akademie Verlag]] | location = Berlin | isbn13 = 978-3050006260 | edition = second | date = January 31, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[Müsli (disambiguation)|Müsli]]'', however, is a special case: in Swiss Standard German (and only there), ''Müsli'' is the [[diminutive]] of ''Mus'' ("mouse") and stands for "little mouse". To describe the food, the Swiss use the spelling ''Mü'''e'''sli'' (reflecting the pronunciation {{IPA|[ˈmyəsli]}} of the dialects).

'''Lakota''' ({{lang|lkt|Lakȟótiyapi}}), also referred to as '''Lakhota''', '''Teton''' or '''Teton Sioux''', is a [[Siouan languages|Siouan language]] spoken by the [[Lakota people]] of the [[Sioux]] tribes. Though generally taught and considered by speakers as a separate language, Lakota is mutually intelligible with the other two languages (such as [[Dakota language]]), and is considered by most linguists as one of the three major [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of the [[Sioux language]]. 

Speakers of the Lakota language make up one of the largest [[Native American language]] speech communities in the United States, with approximately 2,000 speakers, who live mostly in the northern plains states of [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lkt |title=Lakota |last=Gordon |first=Raymond G., Jr. |year=2005 |website=Ethnologue: Languages of the World |edition=15th |publisher=SIL International |accessdate=2009-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a Lakota language program online available for children to use.&lt;ref name="lakhota.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lakota Language Consortium |url=http://www.lakhota.org |accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a Lakota Language Program with classes for children at Red Cloud Indian School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redcloudschool.org/LLP|title=About the Lakota Language Program |publisher=Red Cloud Indian School |accessdate=28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language was first put into written form by European-American missionaries around 1840. It has since evolved to reflect contemporary needs and usage.

==History and origin==
The [[Lakota people]]'s creation stories say that language originated from the creation of the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sneve |first1=Paul |year=2013 |title=Anamnesis in the Lakota Language and Lakota Concepts of Time and Matter |journal=Anglican Theological Review |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=487–493 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=Thomas G |year=2002 |title=Turning the Tables on Assimilation: Oglala Lakotas and the Pine Ridge Day Schools 1889–1920s |journal=Western Historical Quarterly |volume=33 |issue=4 |page=407 |doi=10.2307/4144766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Lakota has five oral vowels, {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}, and three nasal vowels, {{IPA|/ĩ ã ũ/}} (phonetically {{IPA|[ɪ̃ ə̃ ʊ̃]}}). Lakota {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} are said to be [[open-mid vowel|more open]] than the corresponding cardinal vowels, perhaps closer to {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}}. Orthographically, the nasal vowels are written with a following {{angle bracket|ƞ}}, {{angle bracket|ŋ}}, or {{angle bracket|n}}; historically, these were written with [[ogonek]]s underneath, {{angle bracket|į ą ų}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Elementary Bilingual Dictionary English–Lakhóta Lakhóta–English'' (1976) CU Lakhóta Project University of Colorado&lt;/ref&gt; No syllables end with consonantal {{IPA|/n/}}.

A neutral vowel ([[schwa]]) is [[epenthesis|automatically inserted]] between certain consonants, e.g. into the pairs {{angle bracket|gl}}, {{angle bracket|bl}} and {{angle bracket|gm}}. So the clan name written phonemically as {{angle bracket|Oglala}} has become the place name ''[[Ogallala, Nebraska|Ogallala]]''.

The [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|/ʁ/}} becomes a [[uvular trill]] ({{IPA|[ʀ]}}) before {{IPA|/i/}}&lt;ref name="rood96"&gt;Rood, David S., and Taylor, Allan R. (1996). [https://web.archive.org/web/20050405024744/http://lakxotaiyapi.freecyberzone.com/sk1uni.htm Sketch of Lakhota, a Siouan Language, Part I]. Handbook of North American Indians, Vol. 17 (Languages), pp. 440–482.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lako04"/&gt; and in fast speech it is often realized as a [[voiced velar fricative]] {{IPA|[ɣ]}}. The voiceless aspirated plosives have two allophonic variants each: those with a delay in voicing {{IPA|([pʰ tʰ kʰ])}}, and those with velar friction {{IPA|([pˣ tˣ kˣ])}}, which occur before {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/ã/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/ĩ/}}, and {{IPA|/ũ/}} (thus, {{lang|lkt|lakhóta}}, {{IPA|/laˈkʰota/}} is phonetically {{IPA|[laˈkˣota]}}). For some speakers, there is a phonemic distinction between the two, and both occur before {{IPA|/e/}}. No such variation occurs for the affricate /tʃʰ/. Some orthographies mark this distinction; others do not. The uvular fricatives {{IPA|/χ/}} and {{IPA|/ʁ/}} are commonly spelled {{angle bracket|ȟ}} and {{angle bracket|ǧ}}.

All [[morpheme|monomorphemic]] words have one vowel which carries primary [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and has a higher tone than all other vowels in the word. This is generally the vowel of the second syllable of the word, but often the first syllable can be stressed, and occasionally other syllables as well. Stress is generally indicated with an acute accent: {{angle bracket|á}}, etc. Compound words will have stressed vowels in each component; proper spelling will write compounds with a hyphen. Thus {{lang|lkt|máza-ská}}, literally "metal-white", i.e. "silver; money" has two stressed vowels, the first ''a'' in each component. If it were written without the hyphen, as {{lang|lkt|mazaska}}, it would imply a single main stress.

===Orthography===
The majority of educational institutions across Lakota country adopted the writing system of the ''New Lakota Dictionary'' as the standard orthography. It is used, among other places, at [[Sitting Bull College]], Oglala Lakota College, by all schools of the [[Standing Rock Sioux Tribe]], by the majority of teachers of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and in almost all schools on Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;. [[Sinte Gleska University]] is said to have been using an orthography developed by [[Albert White Hat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arlene B. Hirschfelder|title=Native Heritage: Personal Accounts by American Indians, 1790 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2OhBCKfo-sC|year=1995|publisher=VNR AG|isbn=978-0-02-860412-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but apart from one elementary level textbook, no literature, learning materials, or dictionaries have been developed with this orthography. The spelling system is not used by Sinte Gleska University language instructors during classes. Historically several orthographies as well as ''[[ad hoc]]'' spelling have been used to write the Lakota language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&amp;LangID=3 |title=Language Materials Project: Lakota |publisher=UCLA |accessdate=23 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powers |first=William K. |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/680162 |title=Comments on the Politics of Orthography |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=92 |year=1990 |page=496 |accessdate=23 Dec 2010|doi=10.1525/aa.1990.92.2.02a00190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 2&lt;/ref&gt; 

The spelling system of the ''New Lakota Dictionary'' is presented below:

The vowels are ''a, e, i, o, u;'' nasal vowels are ''aŋ, iŋ, uŋ.'' [[Pitch accent]] is marked with an [[acute accent]]: ''á, é, í, ó, ú, áŋ, íŋ, úŋ'' on stressed vowels (which receive a higher tone than non-stressed ones)&lt;ref&gt;Cho, Taehong. "Some phonological and phonetic aspects of stress and intonation in Lakhota: a preliminary report", Published as a PDF at :[http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/linguistics/people/grads/taehong/Lakhota.pdf humnet.ucla.edu "Lakhota"], Linguistics, UCLA&lt;/ref&gt;

The following consonants approximate their IPA values: ''b, g, h, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w, z''. ''Y'' has its English value of {{IPA|/j/}}. An apostrophe, ’, is used for [[glottal stop]].

A [[caron]] is used for sounds which are not written with Latin letters in the IPA: ''č'' {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, ''ǧ'' {{IPA|/ʁ/}}, ''ȟ'' {{IPA|/χ/}}, ''š'' {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, ''ž'' {{IPA|/ʒ/}}. Aspirates are written with ''h'': ''čh, kh, ph, th,'' and velar frication with ''ȟ'': ''kȟ, pȟ, tȟ.'' Ejectives are written with an apostrophe: ''č’, ȟ’, k’, p’, s’, š’, t’&amp;zwnj;''.

The spelling used in modern popular texts is often written without diacritics. Besides failing to mark stress, this also results in the confusion of numerous consonants: {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} are both written ''s'', {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/χ/}} are both written ''h'', and the aspirate stops are written like the unaspirates, as ''p, t, c, k''.

====Alphabet====

Standard Lakota Orthography, as used by the majority of schools, is in principle phonemic, which means that each character ([[grapheme]]) represents one distinctive sound ([[phoneme]]), except for the distinction between glottal and velar aspiration, which is treated phonetically.

All digraphs (i.e. characters created by two letters, such as kh, kȟ, k’) are treated as groups of individual letters in alphabetization. Thus for example the word {{lang|lkt|čhíŋ}} precedes {{lang|lkt|čónala}} in a dictionary.

===Phonological processes===

A common phonological process which occurs in rapid speech is ''vowel contraction'', which generally results from the loss of an intervocalic glide. Vowel contraction results in phonetic long vowels ([[phoneme|phonemically]] a sequence of two identical vowels), with falling pitch if the first underlying vowel is stressed, and rising pitch if the second underlying vowel is stressed: ''kê:'' (falling tone), "he said that", from {{lang|lkt|kéye}}; ''hǎ:pi'' (rising tone), "clothing", from {{lang|lkt|hayápi}}. If one of the vowels is nasalized, the resulting long vowel is also nasalized: ''čhaŋ̌:pi'', "sugar", from {{lang|lkt|čhaŋháŋpi}}.&lt;ref name="rood96" /&gt;

When two vowels of unequal height contract, or when feature contrasts exist between the vowels and the glide, two new phonetic vowels, {{IPA|[æː]}} and {{IPA|[ɔː]}}, result:&lt;ref name="rood96" /&gt; ''iyæ̂:'', "he left for there", from {{lang|lkt|iyáye}}; ''mitȟa:'', "it's mine", from {{lang|lkt|mitȟáwa}}.

The plural [[clitic|enclitic]] ''=pi'' is frequently changed in rapid speech when preceding the enclitics ''=kte'', ''=kiŋ'', ''=kštó'', or ''=na''. If the vowel preceding ''=pi'' is high/open, ''=pi'' becomes [u]; if the vowel is non-high (mid or closed), ''=pi'' becomes [o] (if the preceding vowel is nasalized, then the resulting vowel is also nasalized): ''hi=pi=kte'', "they will arrive here", [hiukte]; ''yatkáŋ=pi=na'', "they drank it and...", {{IPA|[jatkə̃õna]}}.&lt;ref name="rood96" /&gt;

Lakota also exhibits some traces of sound symbolism among fricatives, where the [[point of articulation]] changes to reflect intensity: {{lang|lkt|zí}}, "it's yellow", {{lang|lkt|ží}}, "it's tawny", {{lang|lkt|ǧí}}, "it's brown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mithun |first=Marianne |year=2007 |title=The Languages of Native North America|location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Compare with the similar examples in [[Mandan language#Vocabulary|Mandan]].)

==Grammar==

===Word order===

The basic word order of Lakota is [[subject–object–verb]], although the order can be changed for expressive purposes (placing the object before the subject to bring the object into focus or placing the subject after the verb to emphasize its status as established information). It is [[adposition#Postpositions|postpositional]], with adpositions occurring after the head nouns: {{lang|lkt|mas'óphiye él}}, "at the store" (literally 'store at'); {{lang|lkt|2=thípi=kiŋ ókšaŋ}}, "around the house" (literally 'house=the around') (Rood and Taylor 1996).

Rood and Taylor (1996) suggest the following template for basic word order. Items in parenthesis are optional; only the verb is required. It is therefore possible to produce a grammatical sentence that contains only a verb.
&lt;blockquote&gt;(interjection) (conjunction) (adverb(s)) (nominal) (nominal) (nominal) (adverb(s)) verb (enclitic(s)) (conjunction)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Interjections===

When [[interjection]]s are used, they begin the sentence. A small number of interjections are used only by one gender, for instance the interjection expressing disbelief is {{lang|lkt|ečéš}} for women but {{lang|lkt|hóȟ}} for men; for calling attention women say {{lang|lkt|máŋ}} while men use {{lang|lkt|wáŋ}}. Most interjections, however, are used by both genders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Conjunctions===

It is common for a sentence to begin with a conjunction. Both {{lang|lkt|čhaŋké}} and {{lang|lkt|yuŋkȟáŋ}} can be translated as ''and''; {{lang|lkt|k’éyaš}} is similar to English ''but''. Each of these conjunctions joins clauses. In addition, the conjunction {{lang|lkt|na}} joins nouns or phrases.

===Adverbs and postpositions===

Lakota uses [[preposition and postposition|postpositions]], which are similar to English prepositions, but follow their noun complement. [[Adverb]]s or postpositional phrases can describe manner, location, or reason. There are also [[interrogative word|interrogative]] adverbs, which are used to form questions.

====Synonymity in the postpositions {{lang|lkt|él}} and {{lang|lkt|ektá}}====

To the non-Lakota speaker, the postpositions {{lang|lkt|él}} and {{lang|lkt|ektá}} sound like they can be interchangeable, but although they are full synonyms of each other, they are used in different occasions. Semantically (word meaning), they are used as locational and directional tools. In the English language they can be compared to prepositions like "at", "in", and "on" (when used as locatives) on the one hand, and "at", "in", and "on" (when used as directionals), "to", "into", and "onto", on the other. (Pustet 2013)

A pointer for when to use {{lang|lkt|él}} and when to use {{lang|lkt|ektá}} can be determined by the concepts of location  (motionless) or motion; and space vs. time. These features can produce four different combinations, also called semantic domains, which can be arranged as follows (Pustet 2013):

# space / rest: "in the house" [thípi kiŋ él] (This sentence is only describing location of an object, no movement indicated)
# space / motion: "to the house [thípi kiŋ ektá] (This sentence is referring to movement of a subject, it is directional in nature)
# time / rest: "in the winter" [waníyetu kiŋ él] (This sentence refers to a static moment in time, which happens to be during winter)
# time / motion: "in/towards the winter" [waníyetu kiŋ ektá] (Pustet 2013) (This sentence is delegated to time, but time which is soon to change to another season)

Summed up, when a context describes no motion, {{lang|lkt|él}} is the appropriate postposition; when in motion, {{lang|lkt|ektá}} is more appropriate. They are both used in matters of time and space.

===Nouns and pronouns===

As mentioned above, [[noun phrase|nominals]] are optional in Lakota, but when nouns appear the basic word order is subject–object–verb. Pronouns are not common, but may be used [[contrast (linguistics)|contrastively]] or emphatically.

Lakota has four [[article (grammar)|articles]]: {{lang|lkt|waŋ}} is indefinite, similar to English ''a'' or ''an'', and {{lang|lkt|kiŋ}} is definite, similar to English ''the''. In addition, {{lang|lkt|waŋží}} is an indefinite article used with hypothetical or [[irrealis mood|irrealis]] objects, and {{lang|lkt|k’uŋ}} is a definite article used with nouns that have been mentioned previously.

===Demonstratives===

There are also nine [[demonstrative]]s, which can function either as pronouns or as [[determiner (class)|determiners]].

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" class="wikitable"
| 
! colspan=3 | Distance from speaker
|-
| 
!'''near'''
!'''neutral'''
!'''far'''
|-

| '''singular''' || {{lang|lkt|lé}} || {{lang|lkt|hé}} || {{lang|lkt|ká}}
|-
| '''dual''' || {{lang|lkt|lenáos}}/&lt;br/&gt;{{lang|lkt|lenáyos}} || {{lang|lkt|henáos}}/&lt;br/&gt;{{lang|lkt|henáyos}} || {{lang|lkt|kanáos}}/&lt;br/&gt;{{lang|lkt|kanáyos}}
|-
| '''plural''' || {{lang|lkt|lená}} || {{lang|lkt|hená}} || {{lang|lkt|kaná}}
|}

The demonstrative {{lang|lkt|hé}} is the most neutral. Once a noun has been located, either by pointing or by description, in space or in the listener’s mind, {{lang|lkt|hé}} can then be used. Before that, {{lang|lkt|lé}} or {{lang|lkt|ká}} is usually used to demonstrate exactly what is meant, although {{lang|lkt|hé}} may also be used while pointing.

===Verbs===

Verbs are the only word class that are obligatory in a Lakota sentence. Verbs can be active, naming an action, or [[Stative verb|stative]], describing a property. (Note that in English, such descriptions are usually made with [[adjective]]s.)

Verbs are [[Inflection|inflected]] for first-, second- or third [[Grammatical person|person]], and for singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] or plural [[grammatical number]].

===Morphology===

====Verb inflection====

There are two paradigms for verb [[inflection]]. One set of [[morpheme]]s indicates the [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] of the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of active verbs. The other set of morphemes [[Agreement (linguistics)|agrees]] with the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of [[Transitive verb|transitive]] action verbs ''or'' the subject of stative verbs.&lt;ref name="rood96" /&gt;

Most of the morphemes in each paradigm are prefixes, but plural subjects are marked with a suffix and third-person plural objects with an [[infix]].

First person arguments may be singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], or plural; second or third person arguments may be singular or plural.

'''Example:''' ''waŋwíčhayaŋke'' "He looked at them" from ''waŋyáŋkA'' "to look at something/somebody".

'''Subject and object pronouns in one verb'''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If both the subject and object need to be marked, two affixes occur on the verb. Below is a table illustrating this. Subject affixes are marked in ''italics'' and object affixes are marked in &lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt;. Some affixes encompass both subject and object (such as ''čhi''- ...). The symbol '''∅''' indicates a lack of marking for a particular subject/object (as in the case of 3rd Person Singular forms). Cells with three forms indicate Class I, Class II, and Class III verb forms in this order.

*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The affix ''čhi''- covers cases where I-subject and you-object occurs in transitive verbs.
*&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Class II and Class III verbs have irregular ''yal''- and ''yan''- respectively.
*&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; These prefixes are separated when ''uŋ(k)''- must be prefixed while ''ni''- et al. must be infixed.
'''Example:''' '''''uŋk'''á'''ni'''pȟepi'' "We are waiting for you" from ''apȟé'' "to wait for somebody".
*&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ''uŋ(k)''- precedes all affixes except ''wičha''-. In the last column, verbs which require ''uŋ(k)''- to be prefixed are more complex because of competing rules: ''uŋ(k)''- must be prefixed, but must also follow ''wičha''-. Most speakers resolve this issue by infixing ''wičhauŋ(k)'' after the initial vowel, then repeating the initial vowel again.
'''Example:''' ''i'''wíčhauŋk'''iču'''pi''''' "We took them" from ''ičú'' "to take something/somebody".
*&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Since the suffix -''pi'' can appear only once in each verb, but may pluralize either subject or object (or both), some ambiguity exists in the forms: ''uŋ- ... -pi'', ''uŋni- ... -pi'', and ''uŋya-/uŋl-/uŋn- ... -pi''.

====Enclitics====

Lakota has a number of [[enclitic]] [[Grammatical particle|particles]] which follow the verb, many of which differ depending on whether the speaker is male or female.

Some enclitics indicate the aspect, mood, or number of the verb they follow. There are also various [[interrogative]] enclitics, which in addition to marking an utterance as a question show finer distinctions of meaning. For example, while ''he'' is the usual question-marking enclitic, ''huŋwó'' is used for [[rhetorical question]]s or in formal [[Public speaking|oratory]], and the [[dubitative mood|dubitative]] ''wa'' functions somewhat like a [[tag question]] in English (Rood and Taylor 1996; Buchel 1983). (See also the section below on men and women's speech.)

=====Men's and women's speech=====
A small number of enclitics (approximately eight) differ in form based on the gender of the speaker. ''Yeló'' (men) ''ye'' (women) mark mild assertions. ''Kštó'' (women only according to most sources) marks strong assertion. ''Yo'' (men) and ''ye'' (women) mark neutral commands, ''yetȟó'' (men) and ''nitȟó'' (women) mark familiar, and ''ye'' (both men and women) and ''na'' mark requests. ''He'' is used by both genders to mark direct questions, but men also use ''hųwó'' in more formal situations. ''So'' (men) and ''se'' (women) mark [[dubitative mood|dubitative]] questions (where the person being asked is not assumed to know the answer).

While many [[First language|native speakers]] and [[Linguistics|linguists]] agree that certain enclitics are associated with particular [[gender]]s, such usage may not be exclusive. That is, individual men sometimes use enclitics associated with women, and vice versa (Trechter 1999).

===Ablaut===
*All examples are taken from the ''New Lakota Dictionary''.

The term [[ablaut|"ablaut"]] refers to the tendency of some words to change their final vowel in certain situations. Compare these sentences.

''Šúŋka kiŋ sápa čha waŋbláke.'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Šúŋka kiŋ sápe.'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Šúŋka kiŋ sápiŋ na tȟáŋka.''

The last vowel in the word "''SápA''" changed each time. This vowel change is called "ablaut". Words which undergo this change are referred to as A-words, since, in dictionary citations, they are written ending in either -A or -Aŋ. These words are never written with a final capital letter in actual texts. Derivatives of these words generally take the ablaut as well, however there are exceptions.

There are three forms for ablauted words: ''-a/-aŋ'', ''-e'', ''-iŋ''. These are referred to as a/aŋ-ablaut, e-ablaut, and iŋ-ablaut respectively. Some words are ablauted by some and not others, like "gray" ''hóta'' or ''hótA''. Ablaut always depends on what word follows the ablauted word.

====A/aŋ-ablaut====

This is the basic form of the word, and is used everywhere in which the other forms are not utilized.

====E-ablaut====

There are two cases in which e-ablaut is used.
# Last word in the sentence
# Followed by a word which triggers e-ablaut

=====1. Last word in sentence=====
;Examples

:''Héčhiya yé'' He went there. (e-ablaut of the verb ''yÁ'')
:''Yúte'' She ate it. (e-ablaut of the verb ''yútA'')
:''Thípi kiŋ pahá akáŋl hé.'' The house stands on a cliff. (e-ablaut of the verb ''hÁŋ'')

=====2. Followed by a word which triggers e-ablaut=====
There are three classes of words which trigger e-ablaut

a) various enclitics, such as ''ȟča, ȟčiŋ, iŋčhéye, kačháš, kiló, kštó, któk, lakȟa, -la, láȟ, láȟčaka, ló, séčA, sékse, s’eléčheča, so, s’a, s’e, šaŋ, šni, uŋštó''&lt;br /&gt;
b) some conjunctions and articles, such as ''kiŋ, kiŋháŋ, k’éaš, k’uŋ, eháŋtaŋš''&lt;br /&gt;
c) some auxiliary verbs, such as ''kapíŋ, kiníča (kiníl), lakA (la), kúŋzA, phiča, ši, wačhíŋ, -yA, -khiyA''&lt;br /&gt;

;Examples

:''Škáte šni.'' He did not play. (enclitic)
:''Škáte s’a.'' He plays often. (enclitic)
:''Škáte ló.'' He plays. (enclitic (marking assertion))
:''Okȟáte eháŋtaŋš...'' If it is hot... (conjunctive)
:''Sápe kiŋ'' The black one (definite article)
:''Glé kúŋze.'' He pretended to go home. (auxiliary verb)
:''Yatké-phiča.'' It is drinkable. (auxiliary verb)

====Iŋ-ablaut====

The ''iŋ''-ablaut (pronounced ''i'' by some) occurs only before the following words:

''ktA'' (irrealis enclitic)&lt;br /&gt;
''yetȟó'' (familiar command enclitic)&lt;br /&gt;
''na, naháŋ'' (and)&lt;br /&gt;
''naíŋš'' (or, and or)&lt;br /&gt;
''yé'' (polite request or entreaty enclitic)

;Examples

:''Waŋyáŋkiŋ yetȟó.'' Take a look at this, real quick.
:''Yíŋ kte.'' She will go.
:''Skúyiŋ na wašté.'' It was sweet and good.
:''Waŋyáŋkiŋ yé.'' Please, look at it.

==Phrases==

"''Háu kȟolá''", literally "Hello, friend", is the most common greeting, and was transformed into the generic motion picture American Indian "[[How (greeting)|How]]!", just as the traditional feathered headdress of the Teton was "given" to all movie Indians. As ''háu'' is the only word in Lakota which contains a [[diphthong]], /au/, it may be a loanword from a non-Siouan language.&lt;ref name="rood96" /&gt;

''Háu'' is spoken only by men; women use the greeting ''Háŋ'' or ''Háŋ kȟolá''.

Other than using the word "friend", one often uses the word "cousin" or "cross-cousin" since everyone in the tribe was as family to each other. These words are very important to the speaker's tone of proper respect. The terms are as follow:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

''Tȟaŋháŋši'' N - my male cross-cousin (man speaking, term of address)&lt;br&gt;
''Tȟaŋháŋšitku'' N - his male cross-cousin&lt;br&gt;
''TȟaŋháŋšiyA'' V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a male cross-cousin

''Haŋkáši'' N - my female cross-cousin (man speaking, term of address)&lt;br&gt;
''Haŋkášitku'' N - his female cross-cousin&lt;br&gt;
''HaŋkášiyA'' V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a female cross-cousin

''(S)čépȟaŋši'' N - my female cross-cousin (woman speaking, term of address)&lt;br&gt;
''(S)čépȟaŋšitku'' N - her female cross-cousin&lt;br&gt;
''(S)čépȟaŋšiyA'' V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a female cross-cousin

"šič'éši" N - my male cross-cousin (woman speaking, term of address)&lt;br&gt;
"šič'éšitku" N - her male cross-cousin&lt;br&gt;
"šič'éšiyA" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a male cross-cousin

''Hakátaku'' N - her brothers and male cross cousins, his sisters and female cross-cousins (i.e. relative requiring respect)&lt;br&gt;
''HakátayA'' V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a sibling or cross-cousin of the opposite sex

==Learning Lakota: language revitalization efforts ==

Assimilating indigenous tribes into the expanding American society of the late 19th and early 20th centuries depended on suppression or full eradication of each tribe's unique language as the central aspect of its culture. Government boarding schools that separated tribal children from their parents and relatives enforced this assimilation process by corporal punishment for speaking tribal languages (Powers). The Lakota language survived this suppression. "Lakota persisted through the recognized natural immersion afforded by daily conversation in the home, the community at reservation-wide events, even in texts written in the form of letters to family and friends. people demonstrated their cultural resilience through the positive application of spoken and written Lakota." (Powers)

Even so, employment opportunities were based on speaking English; a Lakota who was bilingual or spoke only English was more likely to be hired. (Powers)&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt;

Schools on the five Lakota reservation started offering Lakota language classes beginning in the early 1970s, but Lakota language instruction suffered very low quality primarily due to lack of linguistic and methodological background of the teachers. Positions of Lakota language teachers were filled with native Lakota speakers without teaching accreditation under the assumption that a native speaker is logically an effective teacher of the language. But for several decades Lakota instruction did not result in creating proficiency among graduates of reservation schools. Students and observers reported repeatedly that Lakota classes from elementary level all the way to college commonly involved mere rote memorization of isolated vocabulary items (usually the terms for colors, number and animals).

In the mid 1970s the situation with Lakota language instruction improved on the Rosebud Reservation where the Lakota Language and Culture department was established at the Sinte Glešká University under the chairmanship of Ben Black Bear, Jr., who promoted standardization of orthography and curricula. He employed college level textbooks and orthography developed by the Colorado University Lakota Project (CULP). A few years later Black Bear was replaced as a chair of the department by Albert White Hat who discontinued the use of the consistent phonemic orthography and the Colorado University textbooks. In 1992 White Hat published an elementary level textbook and promoted it as the only teaching material for schools of all levels in Rosebud. White Hat established his own orthography, one that is very diacritic heavy and impractical. This had a detrimental impact on the quality of instruction in Rosebud and resulted in almost complete disintegration of Lakota language teaching infrastructure in Rosebud, because school boards and administrators gradually lost trust in the effectiveness of Lakota language teachers and classes. By 2015, only one Rosebud school offered Lakota language classes and there were only 2 Lakota language teachers.

Lakota language classes continued to be offered between 1970s and 2000s on other Lakota reservations (Pine Ridge, Cheyenne River and Standing Rock), but the three decades did not result in developing any proficiency among students. The situation started improving gradually in early 2000’s when teacher training started to be offered to Lakota language teachers and especially after 2006 when the Lakota Summer Institute was established by the Lakota Language Consortium and the Sitting Bull College on Standing Rock. The institute offers high quality training for Lakota language teachers, educating them in Lakota linguistics and language teaching methodology. Since 2008 the institute also started offering classes for Lakota language learners.

By 2015, there has been a major improvement of Lakota language proficiency levels among students of reservation schools. This was due to teacher training available through the Lakota Summer Institute and to the adoption of consistent phonemic orthography introduced in the New Lakota Dictionary (2008) and the Lakota Grammar Handbook (2016). This orthography and the effective teaching methods enabled teachers and students for the first time to teach and learn correct pronunciation. It has been reported repeatedly that students are increasingly able to have Lakota conversations with elders. Revitalization efforts were further strengthened by the establishment of several Lakota language immersion schools (such as the Language Nest in Standing Rock and the immersion school in Oglala, Pine Ridge).

One of the most influential and consistent figures of the Lakota Language Revitalization has been Ben Black Bear, Jr., who established the Lakota Language Department at the Sįté Glešká University in 1970s. Since 2009 he has been teaching Lakota at the Lakota Summer Institute at Sitting Bull College in Standing Rock. He has been a long term board member of the Lakota Language Consortium and he co-authored the Lakota Audio Series and the Lakota Grammar Handbook, which is the most accurate grammar of the language and probably the most detailed grammar ever written for a Native American language.&lt;ref&gt;''Lakota Grammar Handbook'' (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 five Lakota tribes (Pine Ridge, Standing Rock, Rosebud, Cheyenne River and Lower Brule) united with second-language education professionals and academic linguists to form the Lakota Language Consortium,&lt;ref name="lakhota.org"/&gt; to produce and implement a comprehensive educational effort to standardize and professionalize Lakota language teaching in tribal and neighboring public and parochial schools. This intertribal movement has resulted in sequenced textbooks, audio materials, reference books and professional teacher trainings that create a new Lakota-centered career path. In November 2012, the incoming president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Bryan Brewer, announced that he intended "to lead a Lakota Language Revitalization Initiative that will focus on the creation and operation of Lakota language immersion schools and identifying all fluent Lakota speakers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

=== Lakota Language Education Program (LLEAP) ===
In 2011, Sitting Bull College (Fort Yates, North Dakota, Standing Rock) and the University of South Dakota began degree programs to create effective Lakota language teachers. By earning a Bachelor of Arts in Education at the University of South Dakota or a Bachelor of Science in Education at Sitting Bull College, students can major in "Lakota Language Teaching and Learning" as part of the Lakota Language Education Action Program, or LLEAP.

LLEAP is a four-year program designed to create at least 30 new Lakota language teachers by 2014, and was funded by $2.4 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Education. At the end of the initial phase, SBC and USD will permanently offer the Lakota Language Teaching and Learning degree as part of their regular undergraduate Education curriculum. The current LLEAP students' tuition and expenses are covered by the grant from the U.S. Department of Education. LLEAP is the first program of its kind, offering courses to create effective teachers in order to save a Native American language from going extinct, and potentially educate the 120,000 prospective Lakota speakers in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Kimberlee | year = 2011 | title = Sitting Bull Offers New Lakota Curriculum | url = | journal = Tribal College Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 69–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government support===
In 1990, Senator [[Daniel Inouye]] (D-HI) sponsored the Native American Languages Act in order to preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedoms of Native people in America to practice, develop and conduct business in their native language. This Act reversed over 200 years of American policy that would have otherwise eliminated the indigenous languages of the United States. This legislation gave support to tribal efforts to fund language education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|title=Faded but Vibrant, Indian Languages Struggle to Keep Their Voices Alive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/08/us/faded-but-vibrant-indian-languages-struggle-to-keep-their-voices-alive.html|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lakota influences in English==
Just as people from different regions of countries have accents, Lakota Native Americans who speak English have some distinct speech patterns. These patterns are displayed in their grammatical sequences and can be heard through some phonological differences. These unique characteristics are also observed in Lakota youth, even those who only learned English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flanigan|first=Olson|title=Language Variation Among Native Americans: Observations of Lakota English|url=http://eng.sagepub.com/content/20/2/181.extract|work=Journal of English Linguistics|accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Livre des Esperitz''''' (or ''Book of Spirits'') is a 15th or 16th century French [[grimoire]] that inspired later works including [[Johann Weyer]]'s ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'' and the ''[[Lesser Key of Solomon]]''.&lt;ref name="Boudet"&gt;"Les who's who démonologiques de la Renaissance et leurs ancêtres médiévaux" by Jean-Patrice Boudet, ''Médiévales'' 44, Spring 2003, [http://medievales.revues.org/1019 (online link)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;[http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/weyer.htm Introduction by Joseph Peterson to Johann Weyer's Pseudomonarchia Daemonum], Twilit Grotto -- Esoteric Archives, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kieckhefer-Esperitz"&gt;''Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer's Manual of the Fifteenth Century''; Richard Kieckhefer; Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, PA; 1997.

Like the ''Lesser Key of Solomon'', the ''Livre des Esperitz'' has been attributed to [[Solomon]].&lt;ref&gt;Boudet, ''Médiévales'', par.27&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Livre des Esperitz'' merely lists the hierarchy of hell, and does not include prayers, conjurations, invocations, or spells to summon any being described.  It does provide detailed descriptions of each spirit's appearance and function, and lists how many legions of demons serve under each.  Many of these descriptions eventually found their way into later works, often unmodified.&lt;ref name="BoudetR" /&gt;

'''Maharashtrian Konkani''' more commonly spelt as '''Maharashtrian Kokani''' is a group of dialects spoken in the [[Konkan#The Konkan division|Konkan region]]. It is often mistakenly extended to cover [[Goan Konkani]], which is part of a distinct language, because speakers of both refer to their language as simply "Konkani". [[George Abraham Grierson]] refers to this dialect as the ''Konkan Standard of Marathi'' in order to differentiate it from the [[Konkani language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosettaproject.org/archive/knn/detail-1?page_view=image_view Konkani Detailed Description — ]&lt;/ref&gt; The dialects which make up Maharashtrian Konkani are Parabhi, Koli, Kiristanv, Kunbi, [[Agri dialect|Agri]], Dhangari, [[Thakri dialect|Thakri]], Karadhi, [[Sangameshwari]], Bankoti and Maoli. These varieties form a gradual continuum between standard Marathi and Goan Konkani, but are considered by some linguists to be a dialect of [[Marathi language|Marathi]].

'''Note-taking''' (sometimes written as '''notetaking''' or '''note taking''') is the practice of recording [[information]] captured from another source. By taking notes, the writer records the essence of the information, freeing their mind from having to [[Information retrieval|recall]] everything.&lt;ref name="Dror"&gt;British Journal of Educational Technology (2008)

Optimising the use of note-taking as an external cognitive aid for increasing learning

http://www.idemployee.id.tue.nl/g.w.m.rauterberg/amme/makany-et-al-2008.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; Notes are commonly drawn from a transient source, such as an oral discussion at a meeting, or a lecture (notes of a meeting are usually called [[minutes]]), in which case the notes may be the only record of the event.
Note taking is a form of [[Discipline#Self Discipline|self discipline]].

== History ==

Note-taking has been an important part of human history and scientific development. The Ancient Greeks developed [[hypomnema]], personal records on important subjects. In the Renaissance and early modern period, students learned to take notes in schools, academies and universities, oftentimes producing beautiful volumes that served as reference works after they finished their studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Nature of Notebooks: How Enlightenment Schoolchildren Transformed the Tabula Rasa|journal=Journal of British Studies|date=2018|volume=57|pages=275–307|url=https://www.academia.edu/34448924/The_Nature_of_Notebooks_How_Enlightenment_Schoolchildren_Transformed_the_Tabula_Rasa_Journal_of_British_Studies_57_2018_275-307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Interactive Notebook: How Students Learned to Keep Notes during the Scottish Enlightenment|journal=Book History|date=2016|volume=19|pages=87–131|url=https://www.academia.edu/11429336/The_Interactive_Notebook_How_Students_Learned_to_Keep_Notes_during_the_Scottish_Enlightenment_Book_History_19_2016_87-131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In predigital times there were many kinds of notebooks used by adults, some of which included accounting waste books, marginalia, and [[commonplace books]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/commonplace.html Commonplace Books]. Harvard University Library Open Collections Program.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[John Locke]] developed an indexing system&lt;ref&gt;Locke J. (1706). [http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/13925922 A new method of making common-place-books]. Google Books: [A new method of making common-place-books https://books.google.com/books?id=sF0HMAEACAAJ]. Also included in Locke's&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a model for commonplace books; for example, it inspired another book, ''Bell’s Common-Place Book, Formed generally upon the Principles Recommended and Practised by Mr Locke'' nearly a century later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stevenberlinjohnson.com/2010/04/the-glass-box-and-the-commonplace-book.html The Glass Box And The Commonplace Book].&lt;/ref&gt; Note-taking is something that many people haven't yet noticed how much it's changed over the course of history.

== Cognitive psychology ==

Note-taking is a central aspect of a complex human behavior related to information management involving a range of underlying mental processes and their interactions with other cognitive functions.&lt;ref name="piolat"&gt;Piolat, A., Olive, T. &amp; Kellogg, R. T. (2005). Cognitive effort during note-taking. Applied Cognitive
Psychology, 19, 291–312.&lt;/ref&gt; The person taking notes must acquire and filter the incoming sources, organize and restructure existing knowledge structures,  comprehend and write down their explanation of the information, and ultimately store and integrate the freshly processed material. The result is a knowledge representation, and a [[Storage (memory)|memory storage]].&lt;ref name="Dror"/&gt; Studies comparing the performance of students who took handwritten notes to students who typed their notes found that students who took handwritten notes performed better on examinations, hypothetically due to the deeper processing of learned material through selective rephrasing instead of word-for-word transcription which is common when typing notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Notes on Note-Taking: Review of Research and Insights for Students and Instructors|author=Michael C. Friedman|publisher=Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching, Harvard University|url=https://hilt.harvard.edu/files/hilt/files/notetaking_0.pdf|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems ==

Many different formats are used to structure information and make it easier to find and to understand, later. The format of the initial record may often be informal and/or unstructured. One common format for such notes is [[shorthand]], which can allow large amounts of information to be put on [[paper]] very quickly.  Note-taking is an important [[skill]] for [[student]]s, especially at the [[college]] level. Many students gain skills as they go through High School and most grasp onto the best and easiest note-taking techniques. Practice in note-taking may lead to great skills in it that may also lead to success in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tru.ca/arts/php/history/A_Handbook_for_TRU_History_Students/Note-taking.html|title=Note-taking: History: Thompson Rivers University|last=www.tru.ca|first=Thompson Rivers University,|website=www.tru.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some contexts, such as college lectures, the main purpose of taking notes may be to implant the material in the mind; the written notes themselves being of secondary importance. Historically, note-taking was an analog process, written in [[notebook]]s, or other  paper methods like [[Post-It]] notes. In the digital age, [[computer]]s,  [[Tablet computer|tablet PC]]s and [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs) are common.

Note-taking is a race against time. The note taker typically is under severe time pressure, and different note-taking styles and techniques try to make the best use of time. The average rate of speech is 2–3 words per second, but the average handwriting speed as only 0.2–0.3 words per second.&lt;ref name="piolat"/&gt;

Regardless of the medium (paper, computer), note-taking can be broadly divided into linear and nonlinear methods, which can be combined.

People tend to write down the most important information to prevent losing time and be ready to note subsequent information provided.

It's also always important to go over the notes you write down on a loop to easily remember any of the information you went over.

== Linear note-taking ==
Linear note-taking is the process of writing down [[Information and communication technologies for development|information]] in the order in which you receive it. Paper is itself [[Two-dimensional materials|two-dimensional]] so linear notes follow the natural succession of time 1,2, and so on, beginning, middle and end. However, the human brain is thought to be multi-dimensional: the more connections one makes to current knowledge, the greater the likelihood of understanding, remembering and applying the information.

===Outlining===
Outlining &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citruscollege.edu/lc/studyskills/Pages/NoteTakingOutlineMethod.aspx|title=Note Taking: Outline Method|website=www.citruscollege.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most common but still one of the best note-taking systems. Notes and thoughts are organised in a structured, logical manner, reducing the time needed to edit and review, allowing a lot of information to be digested in a short period of time. Outlining is less effective for classes that involve many formulas and graphs, like mathematics or chemistry. In these situations, a system such as [[Cornell Notes|Cornell notes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornellcollege.edu/academic-support-and-advising/study-tips/reading-textbooks.shtml|title=Reading a Textbook for True Understanding - Cornell College|website=www.cornellcollege.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be superior.

[[Outline (list)|Outlines]] tend to proceed down a page, using headings and [[Bullet (typography)|bullets]] to structure information. A common system consists of [[Subject heading|heading]]s that use [[Roman numerals]], letters of the [[alphabet]], and [[Arabic numerals]] at different levels.  A typical structure would be:

:I. First main topic
::A. Subtopic
::# Detail
::# Detail
::# Detail
::B. Subtopic 
::# Detail
::# Detail
::# Detail
:II. Second main topic
::A. Subtopic
::# Detail
::# Detail
::# Detail    
::B. Subtopic
::# Detail
::# Detail
::# Detail

However, this sort of structure has limitations in written form since it is difficult to go back and insert more information. Adaptive systems are used for paper-and-pen insertions, such as using the reverse side of the preceding page in a spiral notebook to make insertions. Or one can simply leave large spaces in between items, to enable more material to be inserted. The above method is effective for most people, but you can be creative in making your own method. (See [[:Category: Outliners]] for more about application software that supports outlining).

However, computerized note-taking, whether with a [[word processor]], an outliner like [[Workflowy]], or a digital notebook program such as [[OneNote]], [[Evernote]] or [[TiddlyWiki]], provides the opportunity to revise easily and add more entries or rows to the outline.

== Non-linear note-taking ==

[[Non-linear editing system|Non-linear]] note-taking involves using mind maps and [[Mind map|spidergrams]] that start with notes in the middle of a page, commonly in an oval representing the topic. Non-linear note taking  may require additional sheets of paper extending the notes at the top, bottom or sides, giving an [[Holistic health|holistic]] overview of the information. The many types of non-linear note-taking include clustering,&lt;ref&gt;Rico, G. L. (1983). Writing the natural way: using right-brain techniques to release your expressive powers.

===[[Charting]]===
This method of note taking is useful for subject matter that can be broken into categories, such as similarities, differences, date, event, impact, etc. Charting works best if students are able to identify categories and draw a table prior to the lecture. This method is also useful as an editing tool. Students may review and rewrite notes using the charting method. The method may work well  for students who like to organize information neatly and who learn by recognizing patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://msliewsclass.weebly.com/charting-method.html|title=Charting Method|website=Ms. Liew's Class|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Mindmap.gif|thumb|right|A mind map connects ideas together visually]]

===Mapping===
Mapping is one of the many forms of note-taking that employs geographic organizers and diagrams to assemble information. This specific method encourages students to continually practice and also to create flash cards because mapping method doesn't come naturally to everyone in the beginning, so practice is essential. Here, ideas are written in a [[tree (graph theory)|tree structure]], with lines connecting them together. [[Mind map]]s, also referred to as [[Brainstorming|brain-storming]] are commonly drawn from a central point, purpose or goal in the center of the page and then branching outward to identify all the ideas connected to that goal. Colors, small graphics and symbols are often used to help to visualize the information more easily. This note-taking method is most common among visual learners and is a core practice of many accelerated learning techniques. It is also used for planning and writing essays.

This method are also for people that have a visual mindset when they take notes better on drawing pictures with different shapes and diagrams. Those who feel comfortable using this method tend to use a lot of colors in their diagrams to make them focused and concentrated in what they  are writing.  For instance, many who use this method might feel more focused when their teacher or professor who use a lot of colors in their power point slides since, the person themselves might like to use colors and use different colors to categorize different kinds of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cristine|first=Goldberg,|date=November 2004|title=Brain Friendly Techniques: Mind Mapping.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ720682|journal=School Library Media Activities Monthly|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|issn=0889-9371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentence method===
Sentence note taking is simply writing down each topic as a short, simple sentence. This method works well for fast paced lesson where a lot of information is being covered. Everyone should record every new thought, fact or topic on a separate line. All information is recorded but is not organized into major and minor topics. Every new thought is written as a new line. Speed is essential, because not much thought about [[Page layout|formatting]] is needed to  create space for more notes. Notes can be numbered or set off with bullets showing where a new thought begins. This strategy is especially helpful when a professor or teacher asks to read the notes. It also saves the time required to formulate and write long, complex sentences.

===SQ3R===
[[SQ3R]] is a method of taking notes from written material, though it might be better classed as a method of reading and gaining understanding. Material is skimmed to produce a list of headings, that are then converted into questions. These questions are then considered whilst the text is read to provide motivation for what is being covered. Notes are written under sections headed by the questions as each of the material's sections is read. One then makes a summary from memory, and reviews the notes.  (SQ3R—Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review.). However, there is another updated version called '''''[[SQ3R|SQ4R,]]'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brazosport.edu/programs/academics/Learning-Frameworks/SQ4R/index|title=SQ4R Reading Method|website=brazosport.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been used by students since the early 60's. It's probably worth your time to try the steps first, then choose and apply only those that really work effectively. It provides a systematic way of comprehending and studying the content that is being spoken. Now students are able to monitor their own [[Understanding|comprehension]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.readnaturally.com/research/5-components-of-reading/comprehension|title=Strategies for Reading Comprehension :: Read Naturally, Inc.|website=www.readnaturally.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; through review. Current research shows that students who use the SQ3R strategy retain more information and achieve higher test scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlston|first=David L.|date=2011-06-14|title=Benefits of Student-Generated Note Packets|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0098628311411786|journal=Teaching of Psychology|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=142–146|doi=10.1177/0098628311411786|issn=0098-6283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guided notes ===
Sometimes lecturers may provide handouts of guided notes, which provide a "map" of the lecture content with key points or ideas missing. Students then fill in missing items as the lecture progresses. Guided notes may assist students in following lectures and identifying the most important ideas from a lecture. This format provides students with a framework, yet requires active listening (as opposed to providing copies of power point slides in their entirety), and promotes active engagement during lecture or [[independent reading]], provide full and accurate notes for use as a study guide, helping the student to identify the most important information covered. Research suggests that guided notes improve student recording of critical points in lecture, as well as quiz scores on related content. In addition, an investigation carried out on students with learning problems showed that the use of the guided notes is an effective strategy to improve the performance of these students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=Sheri L.|last2=Seibert|first2=Marilyn A.|last3=Gardner|first3=Ralph|last4=Talbert-Johnson|first4=Carolyn|date=May 2000|title=Using Guided Notes to Improve the Academic Achievement of Incarcerated Adolescents with Learning and Behavior Problems|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/074193250002100302|journal=Remedial and Special Education|volume=21|issue=3|pages=133–170|doi=10.1177/074193250002100302|issn=0741-9325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic note-taking methods==
{{see also|Electronic notetaking}}
The growing ubiquity of laptops in universities and colleges has led to a rise in electronic note-taking. Many students write their notes in [[word processor]]s or prepare digital hand-written notes using a [[graphics tablet]] or [[tablet computer]] and [[stylus|styli]] or [[digital pen]]s, with the aid of note-taking [[software]]. Online applications are receiving growing attention from students who can forward notes using email, or otherwise make use of collaborative features in these applications and can also download the texts as a file (txt, rtf...) in a local computer. It has also become common for [[lecturer]]s to deliver [[lecture]]s using these and similar technologies, including [[electronic whiteboard]]s, especially at [[Institute of technology|institutes of technology]].

Online note-taking has created problems for teachers who must balance educational [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom]] with copyright and intellectual property concerns regarding course content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.becoming-a-lawyer.com/law-students/how-to/take-notes-law-student/|title=How to take notes as a law student - Becoming A Lawyer|date=2017-01-06|work=Becoming A Lawyer|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic note-taking has shown ineffectiveness when compared to traditional methods of note-taking. A study done by Pam A. Mueller of Princeton University and Daniel M. Oppenheimer of the University of California have shown that students who take notes digitally against students who take notes on paper retain less information and have difficulties remembering what they've typed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away|title=Attention, Students: Put Your Laptops Away|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic note-taking has created computer-aided distractions in class as multitasking on laptops is very easy to accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cain|first=J|last2=Bird|first2=ER|last3=Jones|first3=MK|date=2008|title=Mobile computing initiatives within pharmacy education.|pmc=4812780|journal=Am J Pharm Educ.|volume=4|pages=72|via=US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. American Journal Of Pharmaceutical Education.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However these researches are only about typing notes on laptops, not writing on tablets.

Laptops are usually a controlled device in classrooms and students may or not be able to take notes on their digital devices when required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noteshel.com/blog/22-the-advantages-of-handwritten-notes-vs-digital|title=The Advantages of handwritten notes vs. digital|last=|first=|date=April 25, 2018|website=NoteShel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Cornell Notes|Cornell Method]] ==
[[File:NotesCornell.png|thumb|Cornell Method "One of the most influential method of developmental education and study skills"]]
The [[Cornell method|Cornell Method]] is a systematical structure that help organize your notes, actively involve you in the creation of knowledge, improve your study expertness, and lead to academic success. The Cornell method of taking notes was developed by Dr. [[Walter Pauk]] of [[Cornell University]] in 1940's. This effective system for taking notes was made prestigious by Pauk's best selling book ''How To Study In College'' and is commonly used at many universities today. The Cornell method consists of dividing a single page into three sections: Notes, Cues and a Summary, its own system is characterized by a right hand column for notes, a left hand column for provoking key words or some type of questions that might help remember key aspects of the topic. Cornell Method also help students worldwide combat the effects of forgetting, which can be instantaneous and complete. It is recommended to read the notes at least 3 times in order for the content to sink in. Otherwise, with time it will be forgotten. For more information please refer to the article  [[Forgetting curve|Forgetting Curve]].

== Professional Notetaking Services ==

Professional notetakers provide access to information for people who cannot take their own notes, in particular the [[deaf]] and [[hearing impaired]].  Professional Notetakers most frequently work in [[colleges]] and [[universities]], but are also used in workplace meetings, appointments, conferences, and training sessions. They are usually educated to degree level. In the UK they are increasingly expected to have a professional note-taking qualification, such as that offered by the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-08-13|title=Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Council_for_the_Advancement_of_Communication_with_Deaf_People&amp;oldid=795341248|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CACDP). Professional freelance notetakers can also be supplied by transcription services companies, such as [https://takenotetyping.com/services/live-notetaking-minutes/ Take Note]

'''Osman Sabri''' ({{lang-ku|Osman Sebrî }}), (1905, [[Kâhta]], [[Ottoman Empire]] – October 11, 1993, [[Damascus]], [[Syria]]) was a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] poet, writer and journalist. He was born in ''Narînç'' or ''Narinc'' (present-day village of [[Narince, Kahta|Narince]], Kâhta) in what was then the eastern provinces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (present-day [[Adıyaman Province]] of [[Turkey]]). He and his family were involved in the revolt led by [[Sheikh Said]], and as a result he was imprisoned in [[Denizli]] in 1928 and after release moved to [[Syria]] and later [[Iraq]] in 1929. While in Syria, he got to know many Kurdish intellectuals such as: [[Celadet Bedir Khan]], [[Cegerxwîn]], ''Tîrêj'' and [[Qedrîcan]]. After the establishment of [[Republic of Ararat]] during the [[Ararat rebellion]], he tried to join the revolt, but he was again imprisoned by the [[British Empire|British]] authorities in [[Mosul]] and [[Baghdad]]. Although he was freed in 1935, the British forced him into exile in [[Madagascar]] one year later in 1936. He went to [[Lebanon]] in 1937, and became involved in the Kurdish party of [[Xoybûn]] and in the Kurdish publications in [[Beirut]]. He also took part in founding the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria]] in 1957 and was elected as the secretary general of that party. Due to his nationalist activities, he was arrested and imprisoned several times until 1972.

==Works==
He published many articles in different Kurdish journals, such as ''Hawar'' (1932), ''Ronahî'' (1943), ''Roja Nû'' (1943), ''Hêviya Welêt'' (in Europe, 1963), ''Çiya'' (in Europe, 1966), ''Hêvî'' (Paris, 1983), ''Berbang'' (Sweden, 1983), ''Roja Nû'' (Sweden, 1979). He published a book on the Kurdish Latin-based alphabet in 1954.

'''Structural steel pipe racks''' typically support pipes, power cables and instrument cable trays in petrochemical, chemical and power plants. Occasionally, pipe racks may also support mechanical equipment, vessels and valve access platforms. Main pipe racks generally transfer material between equipment and storage or utility areas. Storage racks found in warehouses are not pipe racks, even if they store lengths of pipe.&lt;ref name=drakewalter&gt;Drake, Richard M., P.E., S.E., SECB and Walter, Robert J., P.E., S.E. {{cite web|url=http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=1388 |title=Seismic Design of Structural Steel Pipe Racks |publisher=Structure Magazine |date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pipe rack is the main artery of a process unit. Pipe racks carry process and utility piping and may also include instrument and cable trays as well as equipment mounted over all of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bausbacher|first=Ed|title=Process Plant Layout and Piping Design|year=1993|publisher=PTR Prentice-Hall,inc|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-13-138629-8|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipe racks consist of a series of transverse bents that run along the length of the pipe system, spaced at uniform intervals typically around 20&amp;nbsp;ft.  To allow maintenance access under the pipe rack, the transverse bents are typically moment frames.  Transverse bents are typically connected with longitudinal struts.&lt;ref name="drakewalter"/&gt;

A proto-city is distinguished from a true [[city]] in that it lacks [[urban planning|planning]] and  [[political system|centralized rule]]. For example, Jericho evidently had a class system, but no roads, while Çatalhöyük apparently lacked social stratification. This is what distinguishes them from the first city-states of the early Mesopotamian cities in the 4th millennium B.C. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?id=IJusBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT736&amp;lpg=PT736&amp;dq=jericho+proto+city+class+system&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TFHOO6Q5dV&amp;sig=R34LRe541hEUftopRpyvPe4Yiik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNjKHv5vHTAhWMChoKHbo5BE0Q6AEIdTAR#v=onepage&amp;q=jericho%20proto%20city%20class%20system&amp;f=false The Archaeology Coursebook: An Introduction to Themes, Sites, Methods and Skills]&lt;/ref&gt;

The break from these later mentioned settlements and urban settlements is the emergence of [[Eridu]], the first Sumerian city, in the [[Uruk period]] around 4000 BC. A [[Europe]]an example of this would be the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]], which dates back to the fourth millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trypillia.com/ Trypillian Civilization Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''rundlet''' is an archaic unit-like size of [[wine]] casks once used in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. It was equivalent to about 68 litres. It used to be defined as 18 ''wine gallons''—one of several gallons then in use—before the adoption of the [[imperial unit|imperial system]] in 1824, afterwards it was 15 ''imperial gallons'', which became the universal [[English unit|English base unit]] of volume in the British realm.

'''Scandoromani''' ({{lang-sv|romani}}, {{lang-no|romani}}, {{lang-rmu|romani rakripa}}&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[:nn:Romani rakripa|Romani rakripa]]&lt;/ref&gt; alt. ''tavringens rakripa''&lt;ref name="TRRO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A recent suggestion apparently backed by the [[Swedish Language Council]] is to call the language ''Svedo romani'' (i.e. "Swedish Romani").[http://www.sprakradet.se/2967] This usage, however, is not widely documented amongst Scandoromani speakers.&lt;/ref&gt;), also known as '''Tavringer Romani'''&lt;ref&gt;Ethnologue [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rmu Romani, Tavringer]&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Tattare language''',&lt;ref&gt;LLOW Language Server - [http://languageserver.uni-graz.at/ls/lang?id=4511 Tavringer Romani]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] based [[Para-Romani]]. It is spoken by the [[Norwegian and Swedish Travellers|Scandinavian Travellers]], a [[Romani people|Romani]] minority community, in Norway (ca. 100–150 elderly speakers),&lt;ref name=Carling/&gt; and formerly in Sweden and Denmark.

"Scandoromani" is a term coined by academics. In Sweden, Scandoromani is referred to as ''resande rommani'' (Traveller Romani) or ''svensk rommani'' (Swedish Romani), while in Norway the same language is known as ''norsk romani'' (Norwegian Romani).

Like [[Angloromani language|Angloromani]] in Britain and [[Caló language|Caló]] in Spain, Scandoromani draws upon a (now extinct) vocabulary of inflected Romani. Much of the original Romani grammar, however, has been lost to the users, and they now communicate in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] or [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] grammar.

There is no standardised form of Scandoromani, so variations exist in vocabulary, pronunciation, and usage, depending on the speaker. In print, Scandoromani words are often written with Swedish (S) or Norwegian (N) letters (''ä'', ''æ'', ''ø'', ''å'') and letter combinations to represent Romani sounds, e.g., ''tj-'' ({{IPAslink|ɕ}}) or ''kj-'' ({{IPAslink|ç}} alt. {{IPAslink|tʃ}}) to represent the Romani ''č'' {{IPAslink|tʃ}} and ''čh'' {{IPAslink|tʃʰ}}. Some examples of Scandoromani variant spellings are: ''tjuro''&lt;ref name="ORR"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ordlista i resandespråket romani |author=Resande Folkets Riksorganisation |year=2006 |publisher=Föreningen Resande Folkets Riksorganisation |location=Malmö |edition=2nd |language=Swedish, Scandoromani |isbn=91-631-9668-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (S) / ''kjuro''&lt;ref name="TRRO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lor.no/lor/spraak.htm |title=Tavringens Rakripa: Romanifolkets Ordbok |accessdate=18 November 2008 |last=Karlsen |first=Ludvig |publisher=Landsorganisasjonen for Romanifolket |language=Norwegian, Scandoromani |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517183211/http://www.lor.no/lor/spraak.htm |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (N) 'knife'; ''gräj''&lt;ref name="ORR"/&gt; (S) / ''grei''&lt;ref name="TRRO"/&gt; (N) 'horse'.

'''Sexual inversion''' is a term used by [[sexologist]]s, primarily in the late 19th and early 20th century, to refer to [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis]]'s definition was "sexual instinct turned by inborn constitutional abnormality toward persons of the same sex".  Ellis, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13611/13611-h/13611-h.htm#2_Page_1 1].&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexual inversion was believed to be an inborn reversal of [[gender]] traits:  male inverts were, to a greater or lesser degree, inclined to traditionally female pursuits and dress and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Doan, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sexologist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] described female sexual inversion as "the masculine soul, heaving in the female bosom".&lt;ref name="Taylor-288"&gt;Taylor, 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt;  In its emphasis on [[gender role]] reversal, the theory of sexual inversion resembles [[transgender]], which did not yet exist as a separate concept at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Prosser, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially confined to medical texts, the concept of sexual inversion was given wide currency by [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s 1928 [[lesbian fiction|lesbian novel]] ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'', which was written in part to popularize the sexologists' views.  Published with a foreword by the sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]], it consistently used the term "invert" to refer to its protagonist, who bore a strong resemblance to one of Krafft-Ebing's case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Prosser, 133; Taylor, 288–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
According to this theory, [[gay men]] and [[lesbian]]s were sexual "inverts", people who appeared physically male or female on the outside, but felt internally that they were of the "opposite" [[anatomical sex]] (according to the [[gender binary|binary view of gender]]). Therefore, same-gender desires and attraction were explained as "latent heterosexuality", and bisexual desire was known as ''psychosexual hermaphroditism'' – in other words, gay men and lesbians were really just [[heterosexual]]s who were "born in the wrong body", and "[[bisexual]]s" were what modern-day sexologists would call [[intersexual]]s (formerly ''[[hermaphrodite]]s'') by this theory (the bisexual person's "male" part supposedly has attractions towards females, and the "female" part have attractions towards males).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisner|first1=Shiri|title=Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution|date=2 Jul 2013|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=9781580054751|pages=8-9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbJaZIosLwQC&amp;pg=PT8|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory fails to explain though the attraction of a "male" part towards males.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9666">'''Statement analysis''', also called '''scientific content analysis''' ('''SCAN'''), is a technique for analyzing the words people use to try to determine if what they said is accurate. Proponents claim this technique can be used to detect concealed information, missing information, and whether the information that person has provided is true or false.&lt;ref name="Leo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skepdic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=167485|title=Statement Analysis: What Do Suspects' Words Really Reveal?|last=Adams|first=Susan H.|date=October 1996|publisher=Polygraph  Volume:25  Issue:4|pages=266–278|accessdate=14 September 2010|archiveurl=http://www.crimeandclues.com/index.php/criminal-investigation/statement-analysis/29-statement-analysis-what-do-suspects-words-really-reveal|archivedate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents say statement analysis has proven effective as a police interrogation technique, but critics argue that it has not been subjected to objective analysis, with most of the studies failing to have used any outside criteria to confirm whether the statements were actually true or false. As it has not been proven experimentally and is generally unaccepted by courts, skeptics call it an example of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Skepdic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leo"/&gt;

== About ==

Related to statement analysis is a different technique for analyzing the words people use called "statement validity assessment" (SVA). The SVA is a tool that was originally designed to determine the credibility of child witnesses testimonies in trials for sexual offences. The "criteria-based content analysis" (CBCA) is a core component of the SVA and is a tool used to distinguish true statements from false statements as CBCA scores are expected to be higher for truth tellers than liars.&lt;ref name="Amado, Bárbara G. 2015"&gt;Amado, Bárbara G., Ramón Arce, and Francisca Fariña. "Undeutsch hypothesis and Criteria Based Content Analysis: A meta-analytic review". The European Journal of Psychology Applied to Legal Context 7.1 (2015): 3–12.&lt;/ref&gt; A qualitative review of the CBCA analyzed 37 studies, strong support for the tool was established as truth tellers obtained significantly higher CBCA scores compared to the liars.&lt;ref&gt;Vrij, A. (2005). Criteria-Based Content Analysis: A Qualitative Review of the First 37 Studies. Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 11(1), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a meta-analytic review found CBCA criteria to be a valid technique for discriminating between memories of real self-experienced events and invented or false accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Amado, Bárbara G., Ramón Arce, and Francisca Fariña. "Undeutsch hypothesis and Criteria Based Content Analysis: A meta-analytic review". The European Journal of Psychology Applied to Legal Context 7.1 (2015): 3–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries such as Holland, Germany and Sweden use these techniques as scientific evidence in court.&lt;ref name="Amado, Bárbara G. 2015"/&gt; However, countries such as the United States, Canada and the UK do not consider these techniques as legally valid evidence in court.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Mercedes Novo, and María Dolores Seijo Martínez. "Judicial judgement-making and legal criteria of testimonial credibility". The European Journal of Psychology Applied to Legal Context 2.2 (2010): 9–115.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have raised serious questions and concerns about the validity of CBCA for assessing the credibility of children's testimonies. One study using 114 children showed that CBCA scores were higher for the group of children describing a familiar event compared to the group of children describing an unfamiliar event.&lt;ref&gt;Pezdek, Kathy, et al. "Detecting deception in children: event familiarity affects criterion-based content analysis ratings". Journal of Applied Psychology 89.1 (2004): 119&lt;/ref&gt; The potential influence of familiarity on CBCA scores raises concerns about the validity of the tool for assessing credibility in children.

It has also been noted that the error rate of CBCA in the laboratory is high, that the error rate of SVA in practice is unknown and that the methodology continues to be disputed among the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;Vrij, A. (2005). Criteria-Based Content Analysis: A Qualitative Review of the First 37 Studies. Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 11(1), 3&lt;/ref&gt; In conclusion, there is still great controversy surrounding the use of the SVA and many studies have investigated its core component, the CBCA, in order to determine its validity and reliability. More research is needed to conclude whether or not the information obtained from these tests should be admissible in court.

==Example==

Statement analysis involves an investigator searching for linguistic cues and gaps in a subject's testimony or preliminary statements.  Ideally, the technique would guide investigators to ask follow-up questions to uncover discrepancies. The creator of Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN), [[Avinoam Sapir]], gives the example of someone saying, "I counted the money, put the bag on the counter, and proceeded to go home." Sapir says the statement was literally true:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He counted the money (when you steal you want to know how much you are stealing), and then the subject put the bag on the counter.  The subject didn't say that he put the money back in the bag after counting it, because he didn't; he left the empty bag on the counter and walked away with the money.&lt;ref name="Leo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skepdic" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sapir says that a fundamental principle of statement analysis is that "denying guilt is not the same as denying the act. When one says 'I am not guilty' or 'I am innocent,' they are not denying the act; they are only denying guilt." Sapir claims that it is almost impossible for a guilty person to say "I didn't do it." He asserts that guilty people tend to speak in even greater circumlocutions by saying things like "I had nothing to do with it" or "I am not involved in that".&lt;ref name="Leo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skepdic" /&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Aldert Vrij]], one of the leading authorities on detection of deception (DOD) techniques, points out that most studies of the technique did not rely on the ground truth being established and thus examiners could not be certain if "examinees were actually telling the truth or lying".&lt;ref name="Aldert Vrij 2008, p. 290"&gt;Aldert Vrij, ''Detecting Lies and Deceit: Pitfalls and Opportunities'', 2nd ed., Chichester, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also notes that there is no standardization among the different methods of analysis and this "implies that much depends on the subjective interpretation and skill of the individual" performing the analysis.  Vrij attributes this to an absence of theoretical underpinning behind SCAN/statement analysis.&lt;ref name="Aldert Vrij 2008, p. 290"/&gt;  Vrij characterizes SCAN/statement analysis as weaker than CBCA because SCAN/statement analysis lacks "a set of cohesive criteria", being instead "a list of individual criteria".&lt;ref name="Aldert Vrij 2008, p. 290"/&gt;  Vrij argues that SCAN/statement analysis is best used as a technique to guide investigative interviews rather than as a "lie detection tool".&lt;ref&gt;Aldert Vrij, ''Detecting Lies and Deceit: Pitfalls and Opportunities'', 2nd ed., Chichester, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that the technique encourages investigators to prejudge a suspect as deceptive and affirm a presumption of guilt before the interrogation process has even begun. Statement analysis in general has been criticized as "theoretically vague" with little or no empirical evidence in its favor, and SCAN in particular has been characterized as "junk science"&lt;ref name="Leo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leo|first=Richard A. |title=Police interrogation and American justice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5kd9C-VwTAC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=%22Statement+Analysis+Scan+or+Scam%3F,%22+by+Robert+A.+Shearer,+Skeptical+Inquirer,+May/June+1999&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yEKLULdFHL&amp;sig=jEAxDI1THoaYWU_VtZin1LH-bK0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T7iPTO_MNMXflgfhtPCkAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Statement%20Analysis%20&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02648-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Submission wrestling''' (also known as '''submission fighting''', '''submission [[grappling]]''', '''sport grappling''' or ''' no-[[Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi|gi]] jiu-jitsu''') or '''combat wrestling''' (in [[Japan]]),{{clarify|date=September 2015|reason=Give the actual Japanese name; they obviously don't call it by the English term "combat wrestling".}} is a form of competition and a general term for [[martial art]]s and [[combat sport]]s that focus on [[Clinch fighting|clinch]] and [[ground fighting]] with the aim of obtaining a [[Submission (combat sport term)|submission]] through the use of [[Grappling hold#Submission hold|submission holds]].  The term "submission wrestling" usually refers only to the form of competition and training that does not use a ''[[Keikogi|gi]]'', or "combat kimono", of the sort often worn with belts that establish rank by color, though some may use the loose trousers of such a uniform, without the jacket.

The sport of submission wrestling brings together techniques from [[catch wrestling]], [[folk wrestling]], [[Greco-Roman wrestling]], [[freestyle wrestling]], [[judo]], [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[Jujutsu|Japanese jiu-jitsu]], [[Luta Livre|Brazilian Luta Livre]] and [[Sambo (martial art)|sambo]]. Submission fighting as an element of a larger sport setting is very common in [[mixed martial arts]], Brazilian jiu-jitsu, catch wrestling, and others. Submission wrestlers or ''grapplers'' usually wear shorts, skin-sticky clothing such as [[rash guards]], speedos, and mixed short clothes so they do not rip off in combat. They are also known for using submission techniques normally banned in other arts or competitions such as heel hooks, toe holds, wrist locks.

==Generic term==
[[Mixed martial arts]] schools and fighters may use the term ''submission wrestling'' to refer to their grappling methods while avoiding association with any one art. The label is sometimes also used to describe the tactic in mixed martial arts competition of relying primarily upon submission wrestling skills to defeat an opponent.

==Styles==
*[[Catch wrestling]]: Also called "catch-as-catch-can", the style of grappling (without the gi) originating in [[Northern England]] has experienced a resurgence during recent years.
*[[Judo]]: A Japanese martial art focusing on high impact throws, pins, joint-locks, and chokes. It is also an Olympic sport, practiced wearing the ''{{nihongo|||[[judogi]]}}'', but has been adapted to submission wrestling purposes.
*[[Jujutsu|Japanese jiu-jitsu]] or jujutsu: An ancient art of Japanese wrestling/grappling that places a heavy emphasis on joint-locks, chokes and throws. Uses a ''gi'' traditionally, but training without one is not uncommon.
*[[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]]: The Russian style of grappling that typically uses a jacket, but without ''gi'' pants. Sambo utilizes leglocks, but most styles do not permit chokes.
*[[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]]: An increasingly popular style with great emphasis on ground grappling. It involves training with and without a ''gi''.
*[[Luta livre|Luta livre esportiva]] ([[:pt:Luta livre esportiva|pt]]): A form of submission wrestling which derived from Catch wrestling, native to Brazil. Trained without the ''gi''.
*[[Malla-yuddha]]: One of the oldest practiced forms of submission/combat wrestling, originating in pre-partition India, malla-yuddha is divided into four parent techniques, each named after particular Hindu gods and legendary fighters: Hanumanti concentrates on technical and positional superiority, Jambuvanti uses locks and holds to force the opponent into submission, Jarasandhi concentrates on breaking the limbs and joints and applying tracheal chokes while Bhimaseni focuses on sheer strength .
*[[Pankration]]: Originating from ancient Greece, it combines elements which today are found mainly in the punches of boxing (''pygmachia'') and in the kicking of many martial arts (''laktisma'') with moves from the also Greece-originating wrestling (pale) and joint locks, thus creating a broad fighting sport similar to today's mixed martial arts.
*[[10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu]]: An American hybrid of no-''gi'' Brazilian jiu-jitsu founded by Eddie Bravo, influences from American folk wrestling and Jean Jacques Machado's (a grappler with several missing digits) style of BJJ. More focus on no-gi half-guard and guard techniques that may be considered unorthodox in BJJ.
*[[Shoot wrestling]]: A Japanese martial art (without the ''gi'') based on freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, Sambo, and catch wrestling, which later incorporated karate, [[Muay Thai]], and judo. The two major sub-disciplines of shoot wrestling are shooto and shootfighting.
**[[Shooto]]: A Japanese martial art consisting of catch wrestling, judo, jujutsu, sambo, and kickboxing.
**Combat Submission Wrestling (CSW): A modern form of wrestling (and MMA system), without the ''gi'', that borrows elements and techniques from catch wrestling, freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, shoot wrestling, judo, and sambo. This style also has a system of striking. Developed by [[Erik Paulson]].
**[[Shootfighting]]:  A Japanese martial art consisting of Muay Thai and catch wrestling.
*[[Submission Arts Wrestling (SAW)]]: A Japanese version of Catch Wrestling borrowing principles from Judo and Sambo. Originally created by founder and former Sambo World Champion Hidetaka Aso. It is now practiced in Japan - Aso Sensei, Australia - Ito Sensei, Canada - Martelle Sensei and Puerto Rico - Ramos Sensei. 
* [[Karo Parisyan#Hayastan Grappling System|Hayastan freestyle fighting]] A submission grappling style developed by Gokor Chivichyan and Gene Lebell{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} that  blends elements of judo, sambo, catch wrestling, Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling.

A '''tagmeme''' is the smallest functional element in the [[grammar|grammatical]] structure of a language. The term was introduced in the 1930s by the linguist [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who defined it as the smallest [[meaning (linguistic)|meaningful]] unit of grammatical form (analogous to the [[morpheme]], defined as the smallest meaningful unit of [[lexis (linguistics)|lexical]] form). The term was later adopted, and its meaning broadened, by [[Kenneth Pike]] and others beginning in the 1950s, as the basis for their '''tagmemics'''.

==Bloomfield's scheme==
According to the scheme set out by [[Leonard Bloomfield]] in his book ''Language'' (1933), the tagmeme is the smallest meaningful unit of grammatical form.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard (1933), ''Language'', New York: Henry Holt, pp. 166–169.&lt;/ref&gt; A tagmeme consists of one or more '''taxemes''', where a taxeme is a primitive grammatical feature, in the same way that a [[phoneme]] is a primitive phonological feature. Taxemes and phonemes do not as a rule have meaning on their own, but combine into tagmemes and [[morpheme]]s respectively, which carry meaning.

For example, an utterance such as "John runs" exemplifies a tagmeme whose meaning is that an actor performs an action. The taxemes making up this tagmeme include the selection of a [[nominative]] expression, the selection of a [[finite verb]] expression, and the ordering of the two such that the nominative expression precedes the finite verb expression.

Bloomfield makes the taxeme and tagmeme part of a system of [[emic unit]]s, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, op.cit., p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The smallest (and meaningless, when taken by itself) unit of linguistic signaling is the '''pheneme'''; this may be either lexical (phoneme) or grammatical (taxeme).
*The smallest meaningful unit of linguistic signaling is the '''[[glosseme]]''', either lexical (morpheme) or grammatical (tagmeme).
*The meaning of a glosseme is a '''noeme''', either a [[sememe]] (the meaning of a morpheme) or an episememe (the meaning of a tagmeme).

More generally, he defines any meaningful unit of linguistic signaling (not necessarily smallest) as a ''linguistic form'', and its meaning as a ''linguistic meaning''; it may be either a ''lexical form'' (with a ''lexical meaning'') or a ''grammatical form'' (with a ''grammatical meaning'').

==Pike and tagmemics==
Bloomfield's term was adopted by [[Kenneth Pike]] and others to denote what they had previously been calling the ''[[grammeme]]'' (earlier ''grameme'').&lt;ref&gt;Pike, K.L. (1958), "On tagmemes, née gramemes", ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' 24(4):273ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pike's approach, consequently called ''tagmemics'', the hierarchical organization of levels (e.g. in syntax: word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, discourse) results from the fact that the elements of a tagmeme on a higher level (e.g. 'sentence') are analyzed as syntagmemes on the next lower level (e.g. 'phrase').

The tagmeme is the correlation of a [[Syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] function (e.g. subject, object) and [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] fillers (e.g. nouns, pronouns or proper nouns as possible fillers of the subject position). Tagmemes combine to form a '''syntagmeme''': a syntactic construction consisting of a sequence of tagmemes.

Tagmemics as a linguistic methodology was developed by Pike in his book ''Language in Relation to a Unified Theory of the Structure of Human Behavior'', 3 vol. (1954–1960). It was primarily designed to assist linguists to efficiently extract coherent descriptions out of corpora of fieldwork data. Tagmemics is particularly associated with the [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]], an association of missionary linguists devoted largely to [[Bible]] translations, of which Pike was an early member.

Tagmemics makes the kind of distinction made between [[Phone (phonetics)|phone]] and [[phoneme]] in [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]] at higher levels of linguistic analysis ([[Grammar|grammatical]] and [[Semantics|semantic]]); for instance, contextually conditioned synonyms are considered different instances of a single tagmeme, as sounds which are (in a given language) contextually conditioned are [[allophone]]s of a single phoneme.  The [[emic and etic]] distinction also applies in other [[social sciences]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8427">[[Malayalam]] has seen the most number of [[Tirukkural translations]] than that of any other [[Languages of India|language in India]]. As of 2007, there are at least 21 translations of the [[Kural text]] available in Malayalam. Malayalam also has the distinction of producing the first ever translation of the Kural text among the languages in [[India]] and the world at large. The Annual Report of the Cochin Archeological Department for the year 1933–34 reported an unpublished manuscript of a Malayalam translation of the Tirukkural made in 1595.

==History of translations==
===Background===
Malayalam translations of the Kural text range from old Malayalam to modern Malayalam. With the Malayalam language tracing its origin in [[old Tamil]], both old Malayalam and modern Malayalam have a rich vocabulary of both [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit]] origin. [[Kerala]] had a long and enduring connection with the Tamil region and culture since [[Ancient India|antiquity]], which flourished during the [[Chera Dynasty]]. For centuries, Tamil remained the educational and administrative language of Kerala, with Malayalam being the language of the common people. The salutary influence of the Tamil literature on early Malayalam literature was more pronounced during the 12th and the 13th centuries, with the ''pattu'' style of literature being a significant example of this influence. Until the 19th century, educated people of Kerala studied Tamil as a second language, and scholars had studied important Tamil classics such as the Tirukkural, [[Silappatikaram|Chilappathikaram]], and [[Kamba Ramayanam]]. However, these were considered as part of the common heritage, and there was no serious attempt to translate these into Malayalam, until at least the late 16th century.&lt;ref name="TK_SeminarPapers"/&gt;

===Beginning of translations===
The first Malayalam translation of the Kural text, and the very first translation of the Kural text into any language, appeared in 1595. Written by an unknown author, it was titled ''Tirukkural Bhasha'' and was a prose rendering of the entire Kural, written closely to the spoken Malayalam of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Govinda Pillai, a judge of the erstwhile Travancore State High Court. He was a translator and versifier who had translated Shakespearean works into Malayalam. This translation is not available now.&lt;ref name="TK_SeminarPapers"/&gt;

In 1957, two translations of the Kural were published in Malayalam. The first one was by Sasthamangalam Ramakrishna Pillai of Trivandrum. Although he completed the translation with a comprehensive commentary and notes in 1933, he published it only in September 1957 with abridged commentary under the title "Ramakrishna Tirukkural." Ramakrishna chose a short metre similar to the original Kural, reflecting the epigrammatic qualities of the original.&lt;ref name="TK_SeminarPapers"/&gt; The second one was by Malayalam poet [[Vennikkulam Gopala Kurup]], who started studying the Kural 25 years ago and learning Tamil in the process, and translated the work with the help of Pandit E. V. Raman Nambudiri of the Oriental Manuscript Library, Trivandrum. The completed work with commentary was published in December 1957 by the Writers Co-operative Society in [[Kottayam]]. Unlike Ramakrishna Pillai, who translated the Kural in a "tight verse" form, Vennikkulam Kurup employed three different metres for the three parts, making it more comprehensive to the average reader without the aid of a commentary.&lt;ref name="TK_SeminarPapers"/&gt;

Several translations started appearing ever since, both partial and complete, including those by P. Damodaran Pillai (1951), [[Tiruvallam Bhaskaran Nair|Tiruvallam G. Bhaskaran Nair]] (1962), K. Chellan Nadar (1962), G. Balakrishnan Nair (1963), M. R. R. Variar (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Tjwao''' (formerly Tshwao) is an endangered [[Khoe languages|Khoe language]] spoken by fewer than 20 people in the [[Tsholotsho District]] of [[Zimbabwe]], all over 60 years of age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.channelzim.net/home/16-featured/4131-khosian-tshwao-language-in-near-extinction|title=Khosian Tshwao language in near extinction|last=Dialogue|first=Radio|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2018|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.southerneye.co.zw/2014/05/14/daunting-task-crafting-san-language-syllabus/|title=Daunting task in crafting San language syllabus|date=2014-05-14|website=Southern Eye|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slightly larger group of 100 have passive or partial knowledge of the language.

It is the only [[Khoisan language]] in Zimbabwe, where "Koisan" is an officially recognised language in the constitution.

Tjwao belongs to the [[Tshwa language|Tshwa]] (Tsoa-Kua) cluster of East Kalahari Khoe languages. It is very similar to the varieties of [[Ganade language|Ganade]] noted by Westphal and Traill. Although mentioned by scholars for several decades, documentation of the language only began in 2012.

The '''Tlingit language''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|ɪ|t|,_|-|ɡ|ɪ|t}};&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lingít'' {{IPA-ath|ɬìnkít|}})&lt;ref&gt;Maddieson et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; is spoken by the [[Tlingit]] people of [[Southeast Alaska]] and [[Western Canada]]. It is a branch of the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene language family]]. Extensive effort is being put into revitalization programs in Southeast [[Alaska]] to revive and preserve the Tlingit language and culture.

Missionaries of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] were the first to develop a written version of Tlingit, using the [[Cyrillic script]] to record and translate it, when the [[Russian Empire]] had contact with Alaska and the coast of North America down to [[Sonoma County, California]]. After the [[Alaska Purchase]], English-speaking missionaries from the [[United States]] developed a written version of the language using the [[Latin alphabet]].

==History==

The history of Tlingit is poorly known, mostly because there is no written record until the first contact with Europeans around the 1790s.  Documentation was sparse and irregular until the early 20th century. The language appears to have spread northward from the [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]]–[[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] area towards the [[Chilkat Peninsula|Chilkat]] region, since certain conservative features are reduced gradually from south to north. The shared features between the [[Eyak language]], found around the [[Copper River (Alaska)|Copper River]] delta, and [[Tongass Tlingit]] near the [[Portland Canal]] are all the more striking for the distances that separate them, both geographic and linguistic.

==Classification==
Tlingit is currently classified as a distinct and separate branch of Na-Dene, an [[indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous language family of North America]]. [[Edward Sapir]] (1915) argued for its inclusion in the Na-Dené family, a claim which was subsequently debated by [[Franz Boas]] (1917), [[Pliny Earle Goddard|P.E. Goddard]] (1920), and many other prominent linguists of the time.

Studies in the late 20th century by (Heinz-)Jürgen Pinnow (1962, 1968, 1970, int. al.) and [[Michael E. Krauss]] (1964, 1965, 1969, int. al.) showed a strong connection to [[Eyak language|Eyak]] and hence to the [[Athabaskan languages]].  This relationship is now widely accepted.

Sapir initially proposed a connection between Tlingit and [[Haida language|Haida]], but the debate over Na-Dene gradually excluded Haida from the discussion. Haida is now considered an [[language isolate|isolate]] with some borrowing through long proximity with Tlingit. In 2004, the Haida linguist John Enrico presented new arguments and reopened the debate. [[Victor Golla]] writes in his 2011 ''California Native Languages'', "John Enrico, the contemporary linguist with the deepest knowledge of Haida, continues to believe that a real, if distant, genetic relationship connects Haida to Na-Dene[.]"&lt;ref name="Golla2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Golla|first=Victor|authorlink=Victor Golla|title=California Indian Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_yqdSE1F8wC&amp;pg=PA303|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-26667-4|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
The Tlingit language is distributed from near the mouth of the [[Copper River (Alaska)|Copper River]] down the open coast of the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and throughout almost all of the islands of the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in [[Southeast Alaska]]. It is characterized by four or five distinct but mostly mutually intelligible dialects, for which see below. Almost all of the area where the Tlingit language is endemic is contained within the modern borders of [[Alaska]].

The exception is an area known as "Inland Tlingit" that extends up the [[Taku River]] and into northern [[British Columbia]] and the [[Yukon]] around [[Atlin Lake]] (''Áa Tleen'' "Big Lake") and [[Teslin Lake]] (''Desleen'' &lt; ''Tas Tleen'' "Big Thread") lake districts, as well as a concentration around [[Bennett Lake]] at the end of the [[Chilkoot Trail]] (''Jilkhoot''). Otherwise, Tlingit is not found in [[Canada]]. Tlingit legend tells that groups of Tlingit once inhabited the [[Stikine River|Stikine]], [[Nass River|Nass]], and [[Skeena River|Skeena]] river valleys during their migrations from the interior. There is a small group of speakers (some 85) in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/map_data_states&amp;mode=lang_tops&amp;lang_id=866 "Tlingit territory"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817053334/http://www.mla.org/map_data_states%26mode%3Dlang_tops%26lang_id%3D866 |date=2007-08-17 }}, Modern Language Association&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use and revitalization efforts ===
Golla (2007) reported a decreasing population of 500 speakers in Alaska.  The [[First Peoples' Cultural Council]] (2014) reported 2 speakers in Canada out of an ethnic population of 400.&lt;!--sourced from ethnologue--&gt;

As of 2013, Tlingit courses are available at the [[University of Alaska Southeast]].&lt;ref name = "ktoo201310"&gt;{{Cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
Tlingit is divided into roughly five major dialects, all of which are essentially mutually intelligible:
* The northernmost dialect is called the Yakutat (''Yakhwdaat'') dialect, after its principal town. The Northern dialect is spoken in an area south from [[Lituya Bay]] (''Litu.aa'') to [[Frederick Sound]].
* The Transitional dialect, which is a two-tone dialect like the Northern, but which has phonological features of the Southern, is historically spoken in the villages of [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]] (''Gántiyaakw Séedi'' "Steamboat Canyon"), [[Kake, Alaska|Kake]] (''Khéixh' '' "Daylight"), and [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]] (''Khaachxhana.áak'w'' "Khaachxhan's Little Lake"), and in the surrounding regions, although it has almost disappeared.
* The similarly moribund Southern dialects of ''Sanya'' and ''Heinya'' are spoken from [[Sumner Strait]] south to the Alaska-Canada border, excepting [[Annette Island]], which is the reservation of the [[Tsimshian]], and the southern end of [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]] which is the land of the Kaigani [[Haida people|Haida]] (''K'aayk'aani'').
* The [[Inland Tlingit]] dialect is spoken in Canada around [[Atlin Lake]] and [[Teslin Lake]].
* The Tongass Tlingit dialect was once spoken in the Cape Fox area south of [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]], but recently died with its last speakers in the 1990s.

The various dialects of Tlingit can be classified roughly into two-tone and three-tone systems. Tongass Tlingit, however, has no tone, but a four-way [[register (phonology)|register]] contrast between short, long, glottalized, and "fading" vowels. (In the last type, the onset of the vowel is articulated normally but the release is [[murmured voice|murmured]], essentially a rapid opening of the glottis once articulation is begun.)

The tone values in two-tone dialects can be predicted in some cases from the three-tone values, but not the reverse. Earlier it was hypothesized that the three-tone dialects were older and that the two-tone dialects evolved from them. However, following [[Jeff Leer]]'s discovery of the Tongass dialect in the late 1970s, it has been shown{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} that the Tongass vowel system is adequate to predict the tonal features of both the two-tone and three-tone dialects, whereas none of the tonal dialects could be used to predict vocalic feature distribution in Tongass Tlingit. Thus Tongass Tlingit is the most conservative of the various dialects of Tlingit, preserving contrasts which have been lost in the other dialects.

The fading and glottalized vowels in Tongass Tlingit have also been compared with similar systems in the [[Coast Tsimshian dialect]]. But, Krauss and Leer (1981, p.&amp;nbsp;165) point out that the fading vowels in Coastal Tsimshian are the surface realization of [[underlying representation|underlying]] sequences of vowel and glottalized sonorant, i.e. {{IPA|VʔC}}. This is in contradistinction to the glottal modifications in Tongass Tlingit which Leer argues are symmetric with the modifications of the consonantal system. Thus a fading vowel {{IPA|V̤}} is symmetric{{clarify|date=September 2015}} with an aspirated consonant {{IPA|Cʰ}}, and a glottalized vowel {{IPA|Vʔ}} is symmetric with an ejective (glottalized) consonant {{IPA|Cʼ}}. This implies that the two systems have no familial relationship. Leer (1978) speculated that the maintenance of the pretonal system in Tongass Tlingit was caused by the proximity of its speakers around the Cape Fox area near the mouth of the [[Portland Canal]] to Coastal Tsimshian speakers just to the south.

==Phonology==

Tlingit has a complex [[phonology|phonological]] system compared to [[Indo-European languages]] such as English or Spanish. It has an almost complete series of [[ejective]] consonants accompanying its stop, fricative, and affricate consonants. The only missing ejective consonant in the Tlingit series is pronounced {{IPA|[ʃʼ]}}. Tlingit is also notable for having several [[lateral consonant|laterals]] but no voiced {{IPA|[l]}}, and no [[labial consonant|labials]] in most dialects, except for {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[p]}} in recent English [[loanword]]s.

The consonant ''m'' is a variant of ''w'' found in the Interior dialect, for example in ''amsikóo'' "(he) knew it", which would be ''awsikóo'' in the Coastal dialects. It is not strictly an [[allophone]] as Interior speakers appear to distinguish the two; it is more likely that the distinction is allomorphic. The consonant ''ll'' is an allophone of ''n'' now mostly obsolete, but still occasionally heard among the oldest speakers, particularly in the Interior dialect. However its former allophony with ''n'' is still evident in many Tlingit loanwords where ''n'' replaces the {{IPA|[l]}} in the source language, such as ''sgóon'' "school".

The consonant ''ÿ'' ({{IPA|/ɰ/}}) has recently merged with ({{IPA|/j/}}) ''y'' or ({{IPA|/w/}}) ''w'' depending on the phonological environment, with ''w'' next to [[roundedness|rounded]] vowels and [[labialisation|labialized]] consonants, and ''y'' elsewhere. It shows up as a ''g'' occasionally in placenames derived from Tlingit during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as well as in some broad transcriptions by earlier anthropologists, e.g. "Gan Gulihashee Hit" for ''Ÿan Ÿuliháshi Hít'' "Drifted Ashore House" as recorded by Olson, today written ''Yan Wuliháshi Hít''. Because the use of ''y'' versus ''w'' is predictable from context where it was originally a ''ÿ'', this graph is used consistently in linguistic transcription, but not in ordinary writing. Note that this consonant has been erroneously referred to as "gamma", confused with the similar {{IPA|[ɣ]}} which is however the [[voiced velar fricative]], not an [[approximant]].

Leer (1991) argues the existence of two labialized glottal consonants, {{IPA|[ʔʷ]}} and {{IPA|[hʷ]}}, which could be written in the popular orthography as ''.w'' and ''hw''. The latter sound does appear in the speech of some speakers, but only in the highly variable word ''oohwaan'' ("first person plural independent pronoun"). This particular word is also pronounced (and hence spelled) ''oohaan'', ''hoowaan'', and ''oowaan'' among other variations. The labialized glottal stop is not attested in any Tlingit transcriptions or recordings, although speakers seem to be able to produce it when requested.

[[Nasal stop|Nasal consonant]] [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] with {{IPA|/n/}} and the [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]] [[stop consonant|plosives]] is common among Tlingit speakers of all dialects. For example, the sequence ''nk'' ({{IPA|/nk/}}) is often heard as {{IPA|[ŋk]}} and ''nkh'' ({{IPA|/nq/}}) as {{IPA|[ɴq]}}. Native speakers in a teaching position may admonish learners when they produce these assimilated forms, deriding them as "not Tlingit" or "too English", but it is not uncommon to later hear the speakers producing these forms themselves. It is uncertain whether this assimilation is autochthonous or if it arose from contact with English, although the former is more likely from a purely articulatory perspective.

Young speakers and second language learners of Tlingit are increasingly making a [[voice (phonetics)|voiced/unvoiced]] distinction between consonants rather than the traditional [[aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated/aspirated]] distinction. This is due to the influence of English and its similar distinction. For speakers which make the voiced/unvoiced distinction the distribution is symmetrical with the unaspirated/aspirated distinction among other speakers.

[[Ian Maddieson|Maddieson]], Smith, and Bessel (2001) note that all word final non-ejective stops are phonemically unaspirated. This contrasts with the orthography which typically represents them as aspirated stops, e.g. ''t'' {{IPA|[tʰ]}} for the more accurate ''d'' {{IPA|[t]}}. There is wide variation in ordinary speech, ranging from unreleased {{IPA|[t̚]}} to a very delayed aspiration {{IPA|[tːʰ]}}. However the underlying phoneme is certainly unaspirated {{IPA|/t/}} because it is consistently produced when the word is suffixed. The orthography usually but not always reflects this, for example ''hít'' "house" is written ''(du) hídi'' "(his) house" when marked with the possessive suffix ''-ÿí''. It is possible that aspirated and unaspirated stops are collapsed into a single phoneme word-finally, however this has not been verified.

Maddieson and colleagues also confirm that the [[ejective consonant|ejective]] [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] in Tlingit are in fact true ejectives. This is counter to the widely held assumption that ejective fricatives are not actually phonetically ejective, but are instead produced as a sequence of fricative and glottal stop. In Tlingit, at least, the articulation of ejective fricatives does include complete closure of the glottis before frication begins, and the larynx is raised in the same manner as with ejective stops. Characteristically, the ejective fricatives in Tlingit feature a much smaller aperture for frication than what is found in ordinary fricatives. This articulation provides increased resistance to counter the continual loss of dynamic airstream pressure. In addition, ejective fricatives appear to include tightening of the pharyngeal muscles which reduces the diameter of the air column and thus further increases pressure. This pharyngeal constriction is not true pharyngealization, however, since the diameter is still greater than that found in pharyngealized consonants in other languages.

===Vowels===

Tlingit has eight [[vowel]]s, four vowels further distinguished formally by [[vowel length|length]]. However, the length distinction is often in terms of [[tenseness]] rather than length, particularly in rapid speech. For the Northern dialect, the dominant spoken dialect of Tlingit and the standard for written Tlingit, every vowel may take either high or low [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]; in the orthography high tone is indicated by an [[acute accent]], e.g. ''áa'', and low tone is unmarked, e.g. ''aa''. The Southern and Transitional dialects have a mid tone which is unmarked and additional low tone which is marked by a [[grave accent]], e.g. ''àa''.

|}

As noted in the vowel chart above, there is an allophone of {{IPA|/aː/}} (orthographic ''aa'') which is realized as {{IPA|[ɒː]}} under the influence of uvular consonants, however this is not consistent for all speakers. The backness influence arises from articulation with uvular consonants, thus the word ''kháa'' "person" is often spoken as {{IPA|[qʰɒ́ː]}}, whereas the word ''(a) káa'' "on (its) surface" is said as {{IPA|[(ʔʌ) kʰáː]}} by the same speakers.

Word onset is always consonantal in Tlingit, i.e. no word may begin with a vowel. Where one would occur theoretically by e.g. prefixing or compounding, the vowel is obligatorily preceded by either {{IPA|[ʔ]}} or {{IPA|[j]}}. The former is universal in single words, and the latter is found varying with {{IPA|[ʔ]}} in word-medial position in compounds. The orthography does not reflect the {{IPA|[ʔ]}} in word-initial position, but either ''.'' or ''y'' may be seen in medial position. For example, the word ''khoowat'áa'' "the weather is hot" (''khu-ÿu-ÿa-t'áa'', &lt;small&gt;INDH.OBJ&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;PERF&lt;/small&gt;-(0, -D, +I)-hot) is phonetically {{IPA|[qʰuːwʌtʼáː]}}, but when the perfective prefix ''ÿu-'' is word initial in ''uwat'áa'' "it is hot" (''0-ÿu-ÿa-t'áa'', 3&lt;small&gt;NEU.OBJ&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;PERF&lt;/small&gt;-(0, -D, +I)-hot) the phonetic form is {{IPA|[ʔʊwʌtʼáː]}} where the glottal stop appears to ensure that the word begins with a consonant.

==Writing system==
{{main article|Tlingit alphabet}}
Until the late 1960s, Tlingit was written exclusively in phonetic transcription in the works of linguists and anthropologists, except for a little known Cyrillic alphabet used for publications by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. A number of amateur anthropologists doing extensive work on the Tlingit had no training in linguistics whatsoever and left numerous samples in vague and inconsistent transcriptions, the most famous being [[George T. Emmons]]. However, such noted anthropologists as [[Franz Boas]], [[John R. Swanton]], and [[Frederica de Laguna]] have transcribed Tlingit in various related systems which feature accuracy and consistency, though sacrificing readability.

Two problems ensue from the multiplicity of transcription systems used for Tlingit. One is that there are many of them, thus requiring any reader to learn each individual system depending on what sources are used. The second problem is that most transcriptions made before [[Franz Boas]]'s study of Tlingit have numerous mistakes in them, particularly because of misinterpretations of the short vowels and ejective consonants. Thus it is important to check any given transcription against similar words in other systems, or ideally against a modern work postdating Naish and Story's work in the 1960s.

==Grammar==

Tlingit grammar at first glance appears to be highly [[Fusional language|fusional]], but this is an incorrect assumption. There are predictable processes by which the basic phonetic shapes of individual morphemes are modified to fit various phonological requirements. These processes can be described with a regular language, and such descriptions are given here on a per morpheme basis by giving rule schemas for the context sensitive phonological modification of base morphemes. Analyzing all the possible combinations of morphemes and phonological contexts in Tlingit and constructing a regular language to describe them is a daunting but tractable task.

Despite not being a fusional language, Tlingit is still highly [[synthetic language|synthetic]] as an [[agglutinating language]], and is even [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] to some extent. The verb, as with all the Na-Dené languages, is characteristically [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporating]]. Nouns are in comparison relatively simple, with many being derived from verbs.

===Word order===

Tlingit [[word order]] is [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] when non-[[pronominal]] [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] and [[Object (grammar)|object]] [[phrase]]s both exist in the sentence. However, there is a strong urge to restrict the argument of the [[verb phrase]] to a single non-pronominal [[noun phrase]], with any other phrases being extraposed from the verb phrase. If a noun phrase occurs outside of the verb phrase then it is typically represented in the verb phrase by an appropriate pronoun.

===Nouns===
:''See main article: [[Tlingit noun]]''

===Pronominals===

Tlingit has a complex system of [[pronominal|pronominals]], which vary depending on their relationship to the verb. The subject pronominals are incorporated into the verb in its subject slot. The object pronominals are also technically incorporated into the verb (i.e. the verb "complex"), but most are graphically independent. They are divided into three classes, the verbal object, nominal object, and postpositional object. There are also the independent pronominals which are completely separate from the verb and can be used in dependent clauses or in subject or object position.

The pronominals all have related semantic values, and their organization can hence easily be visualized in a table.

|}

The numbers in the first column represent the usual concept of person, i.e. first, second, or third. Story and Naish identified a [[fourth person]], but this term is inappropriate since they did not describe a clear separation between the so-called fourth person and the other impersonal pronominals.

When analyzing a sentence, the pronominal type is given first, then the form (subject, object, independent) is given following a period. This uniquely represents the pronominal as a two dimensional unit. Thus 1&lt;small&gt;SINGULAR SUBJECT&lt;/small&gt; is the first person singular subject pronominal, realized as ''xhat''. The &lt;small&gt;RECIPROCAL&lt;/small&gt; does not uniquely identify one of the two reciprocal pronominals, but since they are both phonetically identical as ''woosh'', it is generally unnecessary to uniquely identify them.

There is also a notional zeroth person which can be of subject, object, or independent form. This is not realized in Tlingit, instead it is an empty placeholder for analysis.

====Subject pronominals====

The subject pronominals are all incorporated into the verb. Thus when the subject is represented as a pronominal, the subject position of the sentence is empty.

====Object pronominals====

Object pronominals are divided into three classes, the verbal, nominal, and postpositional.

The verbal object pronominals function similarly to the subject pronominals in that they preclude an explicit object when used.

The nominal object pronominals are similar in some respects to the possessive pronouns of English. They precede a noun and represent the object of the noun, typically implying possession of the noun.

Postpositional object pronominals function as objects to which postpositions are attached. They act as the object of a postposition in a manner similar to an ordinary noun suffixed with a postposition.

===Directionals===

Strictly speaking, the Tlingit directionals can be classified as nouns on the basis of their syntactic function. However, they form a distinct semantic set of nouns which indicate direction relative to some stated position. They also show stem variation depending locative suffixation, in particular with the allative suffix ''-dei''. These stem variants also occur with the adverb construction ''N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''-da-''N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''-(i)n "''N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''-ward" where ''N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an anatomic noun and ''N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a directional stem.

===Particles===

Particles function as neither noun nor verb. They are restricted to positions relative to phrases in the sentence.

====Focus particles====

The focus particles are particles which follow the left periphery ("forephrase" per Leer) of a sentence. The Naish-Story term for them is "post-marginals". Many may be suffixed with a demonstrative (''-yá'', ''-hé'', ''-wé'', ''-yú''), also they may be combined with the interrogative (''-gé''). Focus particles are stylistically written as separate words, although phonetically they may be indivisible from the preceding utterance.

* ''sá'' — wh-question
* ''gé'' — dubitative, unlikelihood, "perhaps", "maybe, "it would seem..."
* ''á'' — focus
* ''ágé'' — interrogative (&lt; ''á'' + ''gé'')
* ''ásé'' — discovery, understanding of previously unclear information, "oh, so..."
* ''ásgé'' — second hand information, "I hear...", "they say..." (&lt; ''ásé'' + ''gé'')
* ''khu.aa'' — contrastive, "however"
* ''xháa'' – softening, "you see"
* ''shágdéi'' — dubitative, likelihood, "perhaps", "probably"
* ''dágáa'' — emphatic assertion, "indeed", "for sure"
* ''shéi'' — mild surprise
* ''gwáa'', ''gu.áa'' — strong surprise
* ''gwshéi'', ''gushéi'' — rhetorical interrogative, request for corroboration, "I wonder", "perhaps"
* ''óosh'' — hypothetical, "as if", "even if", "if only"

The combination of the focus ''á'' with the demonstratives gives the frequently used particles ''áyá'' and ''áwé'', and the less common ''áhé'' and ''áyú''. Combination of the interrogative ''ágé'' with the demonstratives gives the confirmative particles ''ákwé'' and ''ákyá'' (''ák-hé'' and ''ákyú'' are uncommon), used to elicit a yes/no response from the listener.

The interrogative ''ágé'' also usually contracts to ''ág'' before ''tsú'' "also", e.g. ''ág tsú'' "also?" &lt; ''ágé'' + ''tsú''.

The particle ''sá'' is obligatory in forming [[Interrogative word|wh-question]] phrases. It can be combined with a demonstrative, with the dubitative, the rhetorical interrogative, and the emphatic assertion, as in the list below.

* ''sáwé'' (&lt; ''sá'' + ''áwé''), ''sáyá'', ... — focused question, "... is that?"
* ''sgé'' (&lt; ''sá'' + ''gé'') — dubitative question, "maybe?", "perhaps?"
* ''ságwshéi'' — "I wonder?"
* ''sdágáa'' (&lt; ''sá'' + ''dágáa'') — "(what) on earth?", "really?"

====Phrasal particles====

Phrasal particles may occur after focus particles that occur with or without demonstrative finals. The following are postphrasal particles, thus they may only occur after the phrase that they modify.

* ''tsá'' — "only then"
* ''tsú'' — "also"
* ''s'é'' — "first", "really!"
* ''déi'' — "now", "this time"
* ''x'wán'' — "be sure to"
* ''tsé'' — "be sure not to"

Except for ''x'wán'' and ''tsé'', the above may occur after the focus particles.

The following are prephrasal particles, i.e. they occur before the phrase that they modify. Naish and Story call these "pre-marginals".

* ''ch'a'' — "just", "the very"
* ''ch'as'' — "only", "just"
* ''ch'ú'' — "even"
* ''tlaxh'' — "very"

====Mobile particles====

These particles may occur before or after any phrase in a clause.

* ''tlei'' — "just," "simply," "just then"
* ''déi'' — "already," "by now"
* ''tsu'' — "again", "still", "some more"

Compare the mobile particle ''tsu'' with the postphrasal particle ''tsú''. Both the sentence ''káaxwei '''tsu''' eetéenaxh xhat yatee'' "I need more coffee" and the sentence ''káaxwei '''tsú''' eetéenaxh xhat yatee'' "I also need coffee" are acceptable. However the sentence ''*'''tsú''' káaxwei eetéenaxh xhat yatee'' is syntactically inadmissible because the particle ''tsú'' is postphrasal, i.e. it cannot precede the phrase it modifies, in this case the noun phrase ''káaxwei''. The corresponding sentence with the ''tsu'' particle in front, '''''tsu''' káaxwei eetéenaxh xhat yatee''  "I need coffee again/still" is in contrast syntactically acceptable. Thus a Tlingit listener will recognize the ''tsu'' particle in a phrase-initial position without confusion but tone is necessary to distinguish it in a phrase-final position. For this reason the ''tsu'' particle is often used prephrasally although it is syntactically admitted in either position. Thus the song name ''Tsu Héidei Shugaxhtootaan'' could also be ''héidei tsu shugaxhtootaan'', but placing the ''tsu'' in front has the advantage of unambiguity, and thus seems more [[Euphony|euphonious]] to native speakers.

Note that ''déi'' is a homonym with the noun ''déi'' "path, way, road". [How are these differentiated in speech?]

The particle ''tlei'' is easily confused with ''tléil'' "no, not", but as with the ''tsu/tsú'' pair the tone makes them unambiguous.

====Sentence-initial particles====

These particles may only occur at the front of a sentence. Naish-Story term these "clause marginals".

* ''tléik'', ''l'' — negative, "not"
* ''gwál'' — dubitative, "perhaps"
* ''gu.aal'' — optative, "hopefully"
* ''khaju'', ''xhaju'' — contrary, "actually", "in fact"
* ''khashde'' — "I thought..."

A '''website content writer''' or '''web content writer''' is a person who specializes in providing relevant [[content (media)|content]] for [[website]]s. Every website has a specific target audience and requires the most relevant content. Content should contain keywords (specific business-related terms,  which internet users might use in order to search for services or products) aimed towards improving a website's SEO.

Most story pieces are centered on marketing [[product (business)|product]]s or [[service (economics)|service]]s, though this is not always the case. Some websites are informational only and do not sell a product or service. Informational content aims to educate the reader with complex information that is easy to understand and retain.

== Functions ==

There is a growing demand for skilled [[web content]] writing on the [[Internet]]. Quality content often translates into higher [[revenue]]s for [[Electronic business|online business]]es.

Website owners and managers depend on content writers to perform several major tasks: 
# Develop, write content as per the business concept.
# Check for keywords or generate a keyword, and research limitations for the keywords.
# Create or [[Copy editing|copy edit]] to inform the reader, and to [[promotion (marketing)|promote]] or sell the company, product, or service described in the website.
# Produce content to entice and engage visitors so they continue browsing the current website. The longer a visitor stays on a particular site, the greater the likelihood they will eventually become clients or [[customer]]s.
# Produce content that is smart in its use of [[Index term|keywords]], or is focused on [[Search engine optimization|search engine optimization (SEO)]]. This means the text must contain relevant keywords and phrases that are most likely to be entered by [[User (computing)|users]] in web searches associated with the actual site for better [[Web search engine|search engine]] indexing and ranking. 
# Create content that allows the site visitors to get the information they want quickly and efficiently. Efficient and focused web content gives readers access to information in a [[Usability|user-friendly]] manner.
# Create unique, useful, and compelling content on a topic primarily for the readers and not merely for the search engines.

Website content writing aims for [[relevance]] and search-ability. Relevance means that the website text should be useful and beneficial to readers. Search-ability indicates usage of keywords to help search engines direct users to websites that meet their search criteria.

There are various ways through which websites come up with article writing, and one of them is outsourcing of the content writing. However, it is riskier than other options, as not all writers can write content specific to the web.

Content can be written for various purposes in various forms. The most popular forms of content writing are:
* [[Blogging]]
* Writing [[white papers]]
* [[e-books]]
* [[Newsletters]] 
* Promotional mails (content for [[email marketing]] purpose)
* [[Social media]] management and promotion
* [[Brochures]]
* [[Flyer (pamphlet)|Flyers]]
* or any other offline or online marketing purposes

The content in website differs based on the product or service it is used for.

== Online writers vs. print writers ==
Writing [[Online and offline|online]] is different from composing and constructing content for [[wikt: print|print]]ed materials. Web users tend to scan text instead of [[Reading (process)|reading]] it closely, skipping what they perceive to be unnecessary information and hunting for what they regard as most relevant. It is estimated that seventy-nine percent of users scan web content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/|title=How Users Read on the Web|work=nngroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also reported that it takes twenty-five percent more time to scan content online compared to print content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://facultysenate.stanford.edu/2008_2009/reports/SenD6159_prntVSonline_reading.pdf | title=Brief summary on online reading vs. print reading Center for Teaching and Learning | date=Fall 2008 | accessdate=July 23, 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905224242/http://facultysenate.stanford.edu/2008_2009/reports/SenD6159_prntVSonline_reading.pdf | archivedate=September 5, 2012 | deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web content writers must have the skills to insert [[paragraph]]s and [[headline|headlines]] containing keywords for search engine optimization, as well as to make sure their composition is clear, to reach their [[target market]]. They need to be skilled writers and good at engaging an audience as well as understanding the needs of web users.

== Content writing providers ==
Website content writing is frequently [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] to external providers, such as individual web [[Copywriting|copywriter]]s or for larger or more complex projects, a specialized digital marketing agency. 

Digital marketing agencies combine copy-writing services with a range of [[editorial]] and associated services, that may include brand positioning, message consulting, [[social media]], SEO consulting, developmental and copy editing, [[proofreading]], [[Fact checker|fact checking]], [[Page layout|layout]], content syndication, and design.

Outsourcing allows businesses to focus on [[Core competency|core competencies]] and to benefit from the specialized knowledge of professional copywriters and editors.

'''Yun Chi-ho''' ([[Hangul|Korean]]: 윤치호, [[hanja]]: 尹致昊, 1864 – 1945) was an important political activist and thinker during the late 1800s and early 1900s in [[Joseon]] Korea. His penname was '''Jwa-ong''' (좌옹, 佐翁&lt;ref&gt;Korean spelling for Sitdown is old man&lt;/ref&gt;); his courtesy name was '''Sungheum''' (성흠;聖欽), '''Sungheum''' (성흠;成欽). a member of Korean early NGO's [[Independence Club]] (독립협회;獨立協會) and [[People's joint association]] (만민공동회;萬民共同會), [[Shinminhwae]] (신민회;新民會). He was a strong nationalist especially in his early years; pushing for reform and modernization in the Joseon government.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"&gt;Clark, Donald N. Yun Ch'i-ho (1864-1945): “Portrait of a Korean Intellectual in an Era of Transition”. Source: Occasional Papers on Korea, No. 4 (September 1975),pp 37-42, 46-50, 54-56, 57, 58&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in important organizations such as the [[Independence Club]] led by [[Seo Jae-pil]]. He also served in various government positions and was a strong supporter of Christianity in Korea.&lt;ref name="Chandra, Vipan 1988 pp 89-91"&gt;Chandra, Vipan. “Imperialism, Resistance, and Reform in Late Nineteenth-Century Korea: Enlightenment and the Independence Club”. (1988) Regents of the University of California {{ISBN|0-912966-99-8}}, pp 89-91, 137, 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Yun's early years were filled with strong support of patriotic and nationalist movements, there seemed to have been a change in Yun’s approach to Korean independence in the wake of the Japanese dominance in Korea, starting with Korea becoming a protectorate of Japan in 1904, and then fully annexed into the [[Japanese Empire]] in 1910. Because of Yun’s apparent change in attitude toward Korean independence and his lack of support of nationalist movements, like the 1919 Samil Movement, many Koreans today see him as a collaborator with the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Caprio, Mark 2007"&gt;Caprio, Mark (2007). "Loyal Patriot? Traitorous Collaborator? The Yun Ch'iho Diaries and the Question of National Loyalty." ''Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History'', Volume 7, Number 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yun Chi-ho was a member of one of the prominent ''[[yangban]]'' families of Korea.&lt;ref name="nyt1913"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/03/21/100257080.pdf  "100 Koreans Freed; But Baron Yun Chi-ho and Other Prominent Men Are Found Guilty,"] ''New York Times.''

July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; he attended [[Vanderbilt University]] in Tennessee&lt;ref name="nyt1913"/&gt; before transferring to [[Emory University]] in Georgia.&lt;ref name="emory"&gt;Loftus, Mary J.  [http://www.yunposun.com/technote/read.cgi?board=doc&amp;y_number=19&amp;nnew=1  "A Search for Truth; Yun Chi-Ho's Legacy is Rediscovered by his Great-granddaughter,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718150204/http://www.yunposun.com/technote/read.cgi?board=doc&amp;y_number=19&amp;nnew=1 |date=July 18, 2011 }} ''Emory Magazine,''  Vol 80, No. 1, Spring 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an early leader of the Korean [[YMCA]] and a South Korean [[Methodist]].

==Early life==
Yun Chi-ho was born on December 26, 1864 in a small village in Dunpo-myeon, [[Asan]], [[Chungcheong Province]]. His father, [[Yun Ung-yeol]], was an official in the Joseon government and as a member of the [[yangban]] aristocracy saw that Chi-ho received a proper education. Yun Chi-ho excelled in his studies of the [[Confucian classics]] at the local seodang and even tried to apply to take the civil-service exams ([[gwageo]]) at age twelve.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"/&gt;

Yun's family was one of [[Joseon dynasty]]'s most illustrious noble families; his 9G-Great grandfather [[Yun Doo-su]] (윤두수;尹斗壽) was [[Yeonguijeong]] under [[King Seonjo]]. But his father Yun Ung-ryeol was an illegitimate son of his grandfather Yun Chui-dong (윤취동;尹取東).

From 1871 to 1878, Yun studied Confucianism at Chang's private village school.

===Trip to Japan===
Because of Yun Ung-yeol’s position in the government, he was able to arrange for Yun Chi-ho’s participation in a delegation of representatives from Korea to observe the process of modernization in Japan in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Schmid, Andre. “Korea Between Empires”. (2002) Columbia University Press {{ISBN|0-231-12538-0}} pp. 47, 49, 76, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Yun was only sixteen years old at the time, but this experience greatly influenced his thoughts on modernization and opened his eyes to world beyond the isolated “Hermit Kingdom” that Korea had become. He frequently compared the lack of progress in Joseon Korea to the rapid modernization of Japan and often lamented in his diaries that he wanted nothing more than for Korea to become the kind of advanced, modern nation that Japan had become.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Yun, Chi-ho. "Yun Chi-Ho's Diaries". Vol I-X. 1975 National History Compilation Committee. Seoul, Korea&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studying in China===
Yun would later travel to [[Shanghai]], [[China]] in 1885 where he would attend the Anglo-Chinese College studying English and mathematics, among other things. While in Shanghai he also converted to Christianity, something that would play a major role throughout the rest of his life. Yun Chi-ho viewed Christianity as a strong progressive philosophy that could help Korea catch up with the advancements of Japan and the West.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Time in America===
He eventually even studied in America, starting in 1888 at [[Vanderbilt University]] and then [[Emory University]]. He strongly admired many aspects of American culture, but was also frustrated with the racial prejudices he experienced while living in the South. In particular, he would identify tensions and contradictions between Christian universalism, and the belief that any individual could earn respect and equality as long as they were pious, and the arbitrary demonstrations of white supremacy that he routinely witnessed and experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Urban|first1=Andrew|title=Yun Ch’i-ho’s Alienation by Way of Inclusion: A Korean International Student and Christian Reform in the 'New' South, 1888–1893|journal=Journal of Asian American Studies|date=October 2014|volume=17|issue=3|pages=305–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While in America he studied English, theology and speech and he gained a great deal of proficiency in the English language; writing most of his diaries in English.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Yun Chiho Emory Univ 1892.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Yun Chi-ho as a student at [[Emory University]] (1892).]]

==Government Service==

===Interpreter===
Yun served in several important government positions throughout his life. He served as an interpreter for the first American Foreign Minister in Korea, [[Lucius Foote]]. Upon arriving in Korea Foote had inquired to the Japanese Foreign Minister [[Inoue Kaoru]] about finding someone to interpret for him while in Seoul, and Minister Inoue, who knew Yun Chi-ho from his days in Japan, recommended Yun to help serve Minister Foote. It was also Foote who helped Yun with arranging his studies in Shanghai.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"/&gt;

===Vice President of the Privy Council and banishment===
Yun also served as the Vice President of the Privy Council of the Joseon Court from 1898 until he was banished in 1899 due to pressure from opposing factions in the government. While banished to the countryside, Yun served as magistrate for a town called Wonsan in Northern Korea. His banishment was not long lived and in 1903 he was called to serve as the Vice Foreign Minister.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"/&gt;

==Korean Independence Movements==

===The Independence Club===
When Yun arrived back in Korea from his studies abroad, there were small groups of scholars who were beginning to call for social and political reform in Korea. One such group was the Independence club, which Yun began to participate in. Among other things, the club promoted educating the Korean people on their unique history, promoted the use of Hangeul, the Korean vernacular alphabet, and pushed for government reform. While in the Independence Club Yun called for the government to be more representative of its people and even supported the elevation of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Kojong]] to the title of Gwangmu Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Neff, Robert D. “Korea through Western Eyes”. (2009) Seoul National University Press. {{ISBN|978-89-521-1003-9}} pp 137&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the group was met with pressure from opposing factions in the government that believed the club was gaining too much influence and so in 1899, the club disbanded.&lt;ref name="Chandra, Vipan 1988 pp 89-91"/&gt;

===The Enlightenment Movement===
As Japanese influence on the Korean peninsula began to tighten, Yun also began to support groups that were part of the Enlightenment movement. These groups, such as the Korean Self-Strengthening Society and the New People’s Society, were picking up the pieces where the independence club had left off, and Yun Chi-ho helped them out by giving speeches and writing pamphlets for them. During his time of Banishment, these groups gave Yun something to work for in the hopes of creating a stronger Korean society.&lt;ref name="Chandra, Vipan 1988 pp 89-91"/&gt;

=== Japanese Annexation of Korea ===
{{Main|105-Man Incident}}

{{quote|Joseon people are 10 percent rationality and 90 percent emotion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2001022101011830074004 The Yun Chi-ho's Diary] The Munhwa 2001.02.21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From his early years, he was disappointed in the Joseon people for always having an emotional response and frustrated in their irrationality.
In January 1910, he participated in the World Missionary Conference in America and that May, he attended to [[Edinburgh World Missionary Conference]] in [[England]]. In December 1910, he returned to his country.

When the [[Korean Empire]] was overrun by Japanese military forces in 1910 (see [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910]]), Yun Chi-ho joined with others in resisting Japanese occupation. He became an anti-Imperialist speaker and independence activist.&lt;ref name="ng2003"/&gt; In 1911, he was Judgment for alleged assassination of the Governor General of Korea. He suffered from malicious punishment and torture as a result of the [[105-Man Incident]].

In 1913, along with 104 others, he was charged with conspiracy against the Japanese Governor-General at the time, [[Count Terauchi]]. He was one of six who were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms.&lt;ref name="nyt1913"/&gt;  His experiences in prison tempered his willingness to express his nationalist ardor,&lt;ref name="ng2003"/&gt; but he was still considered active in the independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Henry. (1921). ''The Case of Korea,'' p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy Trial and Imprisonment==
In 1911 Yun was implicated in assisting with an assassination attempt on Japanese governor-general, Terauchi Masatake. Sources from within some of the Enlightenment Movement groups that Yun had taken part in had informed Japanese officials that he had a hand in planning this attempted assassination. He was put on trial and given the maximum sentence. However, after a series of retrials his sentence was shortened and he eventually gained amnesty after only six years in jail.&lt;ref name="Caprio, Mark 2007"/&gt; During this time, he didn’t write down anything in his diaries, but his experience in the Japanese prison system seemed to have a significant effect on his actions after his release. In fact, his release can be seen as a turning point for Yun Chi-ho where he began to make many pro-Japanese statements and gives much less support to Korean nationalistic movements.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"/&gt;

==March 1 Movement==
Inspired by Woodrow Wilson’s idea of “self-determination” presented at the Paris Peace Conference the previous year, on March 1, 1919 many Koreans took to the streets in a peaceful protest to demonstrate that Korea was ready for independence from Japan. Yun knew that the European nations would not take this demonstration seriously. Yun said the following about the movement:
“He who buys a field and keeps it from falling into irredeemable hands is a wiser patriot than he who sells his lands to finance the independent movement. He who sends a poor boy to school to become more intelligent than his fathers is doing a greater service than he who stirs up students for political agitations. He who leads an erring man into decent religious life is serving the Korean race better than he who sends ignorant folks to jail for yelling ‘mansei.’ Now is the time for Koreans to learn and wait.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Japanese Support==
Yun’s reversal in opinion took an even larger turn from his previous nationalistic rhetoric when he began supporting the Japanese war efforts during WWII. He urged the young men of Korea to help the Japanese to victory by assisting in the war effort.
