      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15385">'''Action painting''', sometimes called "'''gestural abstraction'''", is a style of [[painting]] in which paint is spontaneously dribbled, splashed or smeared onto the canvas, rather than being carefully applied.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting work often emphasizes the physical act of painting itself as an essential aspect of the finished work or concern of its artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
The style was widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with [[abstract expressionism]] (some critics have used the terms "action painting" and "[[abstract expressionism]]" interchangeably).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[New York School (art)|The New York School]] of American Abstract Expressionism (1940s-50s) is also seen as closely linked to the movement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/action-painting.htm|title=Action Painting Technique: Definition, Characteristics|website=www.visual-arts-cork.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798
| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20160410120628/http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his essay "The American Action Painters",&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn, 2008,  ''Art History'', 3:d edition, London, Pearson Education, p. 1133.&lt;/ref&gt;  
and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was "an arena in which to act".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/gene/action-painting|title=Action Painting {{!}} Artsy|website=www.artsy.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actions and means for creating the painting were seen, in action painting, of a higher importance than the end result.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Rosenberg created the term "action painting" in 1952, he began creating his action theory in the 1930s as a critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slifkin|first=Robert|date=June 2011|title=The Tragic Image: Action Painting Refigured|url=https://cod.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=vth&amp;AN=64112998&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Oxford Art Journal|volume=34|pages=227–246|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' "objectness." Clement Greenberg was also an influential critic in action painting, intrigued by the creative struggle, which he claimed was evidenced by the surface of the painting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them. "Some of the labels that became attached to Abstract Expressionism, like "informel" and "Action Painting," definitely implied this; one was given to understand that what was involved was an utterly new kind of art that was no longer art in any accepted sense. This was, of course, absurd." &amp;ndash; Clement Greenberg, "Post Painterly Abstraction".

Rosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who used the term "action" at first in this sense and fostered the theory of the subjective struggle with it. In his theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space, in which the artist "acts" like in an ecstatic ritual, Paalen considers ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Mark Rothko]]; Paalen describes a highly artistic vision of totemic art as part of a ritual "action" with psychic links to genetic memory and matrilinear ancestor-worship.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two decades, Rosenberg's redefinition of art as an act rather than an object, as a process rather than a product, was influential, and laid the foundation for a number of major art movements, from [[Happening]]s and [[Fluxus]] to [[Conceptual Art|Conceptual]], [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]] and [[Earth Art]].

== Historical context ==
It is essential for the understanding of action painting to place it in historical context.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The action painting movement took place in the time after World War II ended. With this came a disordered economy and culture in Europe, and in America the government took advantage of their new state of importance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Jason Edwards|date=Spring 2008|title=What the Mind's Eye Sees: Action painters were postwar exemplars of American individualism|url=https://cod.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=vth&amp;AN=31308622&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=American Scholar|volume=77|pages=113–117|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product of the [[post-World War II]] artistic resurgence of [[expressionism]] in [[United States|America]] and more specifically [[New York City]], action painting developed in an era where [[quantum mechanics]] and [[psychoanalysis]] were beginning to flourish and were changing people's perception of the physical and psychological world; and civilization's understanding of the world through heightened [[self-consciousness]] and awareness.

American action painters pondered the nature of art as well as the reasons for the existence of art often when questioning what the value of action painting is.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The preceding art of [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] had freed itself from the portrayal of objects and instead tried to evoke, address and delineate, through the aesthetic sense, emotions and feelings within the viewer. ''Action painting'' took this a step further, using both [[Jung]] and [[Freud]]’s ideas of the [[subconscious]] as its underlying foundations. Many of the painters were interested in Carl Jung's studies of archetypal images and types, and used their own internal visions to create their paintings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Along with Jung, Sigmund Freud and Surrealism were also influential to the beginning of action painting.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The paintings of the Action painters were not meant to portray objects per se or even specific emotions. Instead they were meant to touch the observer deep in the subconscious mind, evoking a sense of the [[wikt:primeval|primeval]] and tapping the collective sense of an [[archetype|archetypal]] visual language. This was done by the artist painting "unconsciously," and spontaneously, creating a powerful arena of raw emotion and action, in the moment. Action painting was clearly influenced by the [[surrealist]] emphasis on [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] which (also) influenced by psychoanalysis claimed a more direct access to the [[subconscious|subconscious mind]]. Important exponents of this concept of art making were the painters [[Joan Miró]] and [[André Masson]]. However the action painters took everything the surrealists had done a step further.

'''Amarna letter EA 245''', titled: ''"Assignment of Guilt,"''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 245, ''Assignment of Guilt'', p. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; is a medium length [[clay tablet]] [[Amarna letter]] from [[Biridiya]] the governor-'mayor' of [[Tel Megiddo|Magidda]]. It is letter number four of five from Biridiya.

The letter is in pristine condition except for a missing flake (lower-right, obverse) causing a lacuna at the end of a few lines. The [[cuneiform]] characters are finely inscribed, with some photos that can even show the individual strokes of the cuneiform characters (the stroke sequence). The letter is 47-lines long, and about 5-in tall. Letter EA 245 (see here-(Obverse): [https://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN00408/AN00408147_001_l.jpg]), is numbered BM 29855, at the [[British Museum]].

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about [[1350 BC]] and 20–25 years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city Akhetaten, in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

'''Anzio''' {{IPA-it|ˈantsjo|}} is a city and ''[[comune]]'' on the coast of the [[Lazio]] region of [[Italy]], about {{convert|51|km|mi}} south of [[Rome]].

Well known for its seaside harbour setting, it is a [[Port|fishing port]] and a departure point for ferries and hydroplanes to the [[Pontine Islands]] of [[Ponza]], [[Palmarola]] and [[Ventotene]]. The city bears great historical significance as the site of [[Battle of Anzio|Operation ''Shingle'']], a crucial landing by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War II]].

== History ==
=== Ancient era ===
[[File:Antium plan.png|thumb|Plan of Antium]]
[[File:Domus libreria 3.JPG|thumb|Library of the imperial villa]]
[[File:MNR 307 - Mosaico parietale da Anzio 1010467.jpg|thumb|Mosaico from the nymphaeum]]

Anzio occupies a part of the ancient '''Antium''' territory. In [[Ancient history|ancient times]], Antium was the capital of the [[Volsci]] people until it was conquered by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]]. In some versions of Rome's [[Roman mythology|foundation myth]], Antium was founded by [[Anteias]], son of [[Odysseus]].

In 493 BC the Roman consul [[Postumus Cominius Auruncus]] fought and [[Roman-Volscian wars#Roman reprisals 493 BC|defeated]] two armies from Antium, and as a result captured the Volscian towns of [[Longula (ancient Volscian Town)|Longula]], [[Pollusca]] and [[Corioli]] (to the north of Antium).&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.33&lt;/ref&gt;

In 468 BC Antium was captured by the Roman consul [[Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus]] following a [[Roman-Volscian wars#Volscian attacks between 471 BC and 468 BC|war started by the Volsci]], and a [[Roman colony]] was planted there the next year. Three Roman ex-consuls were appointed as commissioners to allocate the lands (triumviri coloniae deducendae) amongst Roman colonists.  They were Titus Quinctius, the consul of the previous year who had captured Antium from the Volsci; [[Aulus Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus (consul 469 BC)|Aulus Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus]] the consul of 469 BC; and [[Publius Furius Medullinus Fusus]] the consul of 472 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ii. 64, 65, iii. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 464 BC the Antiates were suspected of allying with the [[Aequi]] against Rome.  The chief men of Antium were summoned to Rome however they gave adequate explanations.  Antium was asked to contribute emergency troops for the Roman [[Roman-Aequian wars#Ongoing hostilities from 485 BC|war]] against the Aequi, however the force of 1,000 troops from Antium arrived too late to help.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, iii. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

With the expansion of Rome it was just far enough away to be insulated from the riots and tumults of Rome. Leading Romans built magnificent seaside villas there and when [[Cicero]] returned from exile, it was at Antium that he reassembled the battered remains of his libraries, where the scrolls would be secure. Remains of Roman villas are conspicuous all along the shore, both to the east and to the north-west of the town.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; [[Gaius Maecenas]] also had a villa. Many ancient masterpieces of sculpture have been found there: the ''[[Fanciulla d'Anzio]]'', the ''[[Borghese Gladiator]]'' (in the [[Louvre]]) and the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'' (in the [[Vatican Museums|Vatican]]) were all discovered in the ruins of villas at Antium.

Of the villas, the most famous was the imperial villa, known as the Villa of Nero,&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; which was used by each Emperor in turn, up to the [[Severan dynasty|Severans]] and which extended some {{convert|800|m|ft}} along the seafront of the Capo d'Anzio. Augustus received a delegation from Rome there to acclaim him ''Pater patriae'' ("Father of his Country"). The Julian and Claudian emperors frequently visited it; both Emperor [[Caligula]] and [[Nero]] were born in Antium. Nero razed the villa on the site to rebuild it on a more massive and imperial scale including a theatre. Nero also founded a colony of veterans and built a new harbour, the projecting moles of which still exist.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antium|volume=2|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the famous temple of Fortune ([[Horace]], ''Od''. i. 35) no remains are known.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

=== Christian bishopric ===
There are records of the participation of a few bishops of Antium in synods held in Rome: Gaudentius in 465, Felix in 487, Vindemius in 499 and 501. Barbarian incursions in the 6th century put an end to its existence as a residential [[bishopric]]. Accordingly, Antium is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 834&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===
In the Middle Ages Antium was deserted in favour of Nettuno, which maintained the legacy of the ancient city. At the end of the 17th century [[Pope Innocent XII|Innocent XII]] and [[Clement XI]] restored the harbour, not on the old site but to the east of it, with the opening to the east, a mistake which leads to its being frequently silted up; it has a depth of about {{convert|5|m|ft}}.  The sea is encroaching slightly at Anzio, but some kilometres farther north-west the old Roman coast-line now lies slightly inland (see [[Tiber]]). The Volscian Antium stood on higher ground and somewhat away from the shore, though it extended down to it. This was defended by a deep ditch, which can still be traced, and by walls, a portion of which, on the eastern side, constructed of rectangular blocks of tufa, was brought to light in 1897.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;
In 1857 Pope [[Pius IX]] founded the modern municipality (''comune'') of Anzio, with the boundaries of Nettuno being redrawn to accommodate the new town.

=== World War II ===
{{Main|Battle of Anzio}}

Anzio and [[Nettuno]] are also notable as sites of an [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] landing and the ensuing [[Battle of Anzio]] during [[World War II]]. [[Commonwealth of Nations|The Commonwealth]] [[Anzio War Cemetery]] and [[Beach Head War Cemetery]] are located here.

In February 1944 [[United States Army|American soldiers]] (the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]]) were surrounded by [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Germans]] in the caves of Pozzoli for a week, suffering heavy casualties. A film based on the events called [[Anzio (film)|''Anzio'']] (1968, directed by [[Edward Dmytryk]]) was made, starring [[Robert Mitchum]] and based on a book by [[Wynford Vaughan-Thomas]].

[[File:Tor Caldara, Anzio.JPG|thumb|Tor Caldara Tower and the Anzio beach.|left]]

On 18 February 1944, the British light cruiser {{HMS|Penelope|97|2}} was struck by two torpedoes off the coast of Anzio and sunk with a loss of 417 crew.

In the same region [[Second lieutenant|Lieutenant]] [[Eric Waters (British Army officer)|Eric Fletcher Waters]] of the [[British Army]] lost his life in battle while serving as a member of the 8th Battalion, [[Royal Fusiliers]] (City of London Regiment), part of the [[167th (1st London) Brigade|167th (London) Infantry Brigade]] of the [[56th (London) Infantry Division]] which fought at Anzio for nearly six weeks. His son, [[Roger Waters]], became the bassist and main lyricist of [[progressive rock]] band, [[Pink Floyd]]. In his honour and remembrance Roger Waters recorded the song "[[The Fletcher Memorial Home]]", which is the maiden name of Eric Waters' mother. (Also see "[[When the Tigers Broke Free]]".)

== Main sights ==
[[File:Statue of Nero.jpg|thumb|Right|Statue of Nero in Anzio by Claudio Valenti (2010).]]
Along the coast are numerous remains of Roman villas. One, the ''Domus Neroniana'', has been identified as a residence of [[Nero]].

In Anzio can be found the Anzio Beachhead [[British Armed Forces|British Military]] Cemetery and a Beachhead Museum.
The [[Sicily-Rome American Cemetery and Memorial]] is in nearby [[Nettuno]].

About {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=off}} north of the town there is a [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] park with sulphur springs and a medieval tower, Tor Caldara.

Near the ruins of the Villa of Nero, in scenic position near the beach, lies the military sanatorium of the Italian army, one of the most important works of [[Florestano Di Fausto]], built in 1930–33.

All along the coast a large number of beaches and sea resorts can be found, including hotels and the famous fish restaurants of the port of Anzio. The city once hosted a [[Casino]] called [[Paradiso sul mare]] that is no longer active and now hosts cultural events. In the southern part of the town, close to the border with Nettuno, are many Italian [[art nouveau]] style houses.

== Transportation ==
Anzio is connected to Rome by the Via Nettunense (SS207), the Via Ardeatina (SS601) and by the Roma-Nettuno railway that connects Anzio with Roma Termini in around 1 hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lefrecce.it/B2CWeb/search.do?parameter=searchOutputViewer&amp;cFID=hshxb0def6ZB|accessdate=16 February 2018|title=Trenitalia webpage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The railway line also stops in the stations of Padiglione, Lido di Lavinio, Villa Claudia, Marechiaro, Anzio Colonia to the north of Anzio.

Ferries and hydrofoils connect Anzio to [[Ponza]].

According to Gedaliah ibn Jechia the Spaniard, in the name of ''Sefer Yuchasin'' (see: Gedaliah ibn Jechia, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/6618 ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah''], Jerusalem 1962, p. 219; p. 228 in PDF), the descendants of Ashkenaz had also originally settled in what was then called [[Bohemia]], which today is the present-day [[Czech Republic]]. These places, according to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (Megillah 1:9 [10a], were also called simply by the diocese "Germamia". ''Germania'', ''Germani'', ''Germanica'' have all been used to refer to the group of peoples comprising the German Tribes, which include such peoples as Goths, whether Ostrogoths or Visigoths, Vandals and Franks, Burgundians, Alans, Langobards, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Suebi and Alamanni. The entire region east of the Rhine River was known by the Romans as "Germania" (Germany).&lt;/ref&gt; are a [[Jewish diaspora|Jewish diaspora population]] who [[Coalescent theory|coalesced]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] around the end of the [[first millennium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mosk | first = Carl | title = Nationalism and economic development in modern Eurasia | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0415605182 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rH9c5JSo1Y4C&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;pg=PA143 | page = 143 | quote = In general the Ashkenazim originally came out of the Holy Roman Empire, speaking a version of German that incorporates Hebrew and Slavic words, Yiddish.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional diaspora language of Ashkenazi Jews is [[Yiddish]] (a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] with elements of [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]]), developed after they had moved into northern Europe: beginning with Germany and France in the Middle Ages. For centuries they used [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] only as a [[sacred language]], until [[Revival of the Hebrew language|the revival of Hebrew as a common language]] in Israel. Throughout their time in Europe, Ashkenazim have made many important contributions to its philosophy, scholarship, literature, art, music and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry L.

The term "Ashkenazi" refers to Jewish settlers who established communities along the [[Rhine River]] in Western Germany and in Northern France dating to the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ashkenazi|title=Ashkenazi - people|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once there, they adapted traditions carried from Babylon, The Holy Land, and the Western Mediterranean to their new environment.&lt;ref name=shum/&gt; The Ashkenazi religious rite developed in cities such as [[Mainz]], Worms, and Troyes. The eminent French ''[[Rishonim|Rishon]]'' Rabbi Shlomo Itzhaki ([[Rashi]]) would have a significant influence on the Jewish religion.

In the late [[Middle Ages]], due to religious persecution, the majority of the Ashkenazi population shifted steadily eastward,&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, Haim Hillel, et al (2007). "Germany."

"Encouraged to move out of the Holy Roman Empire as persecution of their communities intensified during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Ashkenazi community increasingly gravitated toward Poland."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harshav, Benjamin (1999). ''The Meaning of Yiddish''. Stanford: Stanford University Press. p. 6. "From the fourteenth and certainly by the sixteenth century, the center of European Jewry had shifted to Poland, then&amp;nbsp;... comprising the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (including today's Byelorussia), Crown Poland, Galicia, the Ukraine and stretching, at times, from the Baltic to the Black Sea, from the approaches to Berlin to a short distance from Moscow."&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the late 18th and 19th centuries, those Jews who remained in or returned to the German lands generated a cultural reorientation; under the influence of the [[Haskalah]] and the struggle for emancipation, as well as the intellectual and cultural ferment in urban centers, they gradually abandoned the use of Yiddish and adopted German, while developing new forms of Jewish religious life and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, Haim Hillel, et al (2007). "Germany." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd ed. Vol. 7. Detroit: Macmillan Reference. pp. 518–46 [526–28]. "The cultural and intellectual reorientation of the Jewish minority was closely linked with its struggle for equal rights and social acceptance. While earlier generations had used solely the Yiddish and Hebrew languages among themselves,&amp;nbsp;... the use of Yiddish was now gradually abandoned, and Hebrew was by and large reduced to liturgical usage" (p. 527).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Ashkenazi'' derives from the biblical figure of [[Ashkenaz]], the first son of [[Gomer]], son of [[Japhet]], son of [[Noah]], and a [[Japhetic]] [[patriarch]] in the [[Table of Nations]] ([[s:Bible (King James)/Genesis#Chapter 10|Genesis 10]]).
The name of Gomer has often been linked to the ethnonym [[Cimmerians]].
Biblical ''Ashkenaz'' is usually derived from [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] ''Aškūza'' ([[cuneiform]] ''Aškuzai/Iškuzai''), a people who expelled the Cimmerians from the Armenian area of the Upper Euphrates,&lt;ref name="Gmirkin"&gt;Russell E. Gmirkin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=noKI6AsqnhMC&amp;pg=PA148 ''Berossus and Genesis, Manetho and Exodus: Hellenistic Histories and the Date of the Pentateuch''], T &amp; T Clark, Edinburgh, 2006 pp. 148, 149 n.57.&lt;/ref&gt; whose name is usually associated with the name of the [[Scythians]].&lt;ref name="Bøe" &gt;Sverre Bøe, ''Gog and Magog: Ezekiel 38–39 as Pre-text for Revelation 19, 17–21 and 20, 7–10'', Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2001, p. 48: "An identification of Ashkenaz and the Scythians must not ... be considered as sure, though it is more probable than an identification with [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]]."
Nadav Naʼaman, ''Ancient Israel and Its Neighbors: Interaction and Counteraction'', Eisenbrauns, 2005, p. 364 and note 37.

The intrusive ''n'' in the Biblical name is likely due to a scribal error confusing a ''vav'' [[vav (letter)|ו]] with a ''nun'' [[Nun (letter)|נ]].&lt;ref name="Vladimir Shneider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sverre Bøe, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vettpBoVOX4C&amp;pg=PA48 ''Gog and Magog: Ezekiel 38–39 as Pre-text for Revelation 19, 17–21 and 20, 7–10''], Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2001, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kriwaczek" &gt;Paul Kriwaczek, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JNKG-U6ym-0C&amp;pg=PT173 ''Yiddish Civilisation''], Hachette 2011 p. 173 n. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 51:27, Ashkenaz figures as one of three kingdoms in the far north, the others being [[Mannaeans|Minni]] and Ararat, perhaps corresponding to [[Urartu]], called on by God to resist Babylon.&lt;ref name="Kriwaczek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otto Michel [https://books.google.com/books?id=CGyOpNrzHj0C&amp;pg=PA450 "Σκύθης"], in Gerhard Kittel, Geoffrey William Bromiley, Gerhard Friedrich (eds.) ''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament'', William B. Erdmanns, (1971) 1995 vol. 11, pp. 447–50 [448]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Yoma]] tractate of the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] the name Gomer is rendered as ''Germania'', which elsewhere in rabbinical literature was identified with [[Kahramanmaraş|Germanikia]] in northwestern Syria, but later became associated with ''Germania''.
Ashkenaz is linked to [[Scandza|Scandza/Scanzia]], viewed as the cradle of Germanic tribes, as early as a 6th-century gloss to the [[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]] of [[Eusebius]].&lt;ref name="Ashkenaz" &gt;[https://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CCX2587501462 "Ashkenaz"] in Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik (eds.)

Estimating the number of Jews in Antiquity is a task fraught with peril due to the nature of and lack of accurate documentation. The number of Jews in the Roman Empire for a long time was based on the accounts of Syrian Orthodox bishop [[Bar Hebraeus]] who lived between 1226 and 1286 CE, who stated by the time of the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, as many as six million Jews were already living in the Roman Empire, a conclusion which has been contested as highly exaggerated. The 13th-century author [[Bar Hebraeus]] gave a figure of 6,944,000 Jews in the Roman world. [[Salo Wittmayer Baron]] considered the figure convincing.&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Social and Religious History of the Jews, by Salo Wittmayer Baron ...

However, contemporary scholars now accept that Bar Hebraeus based his figure on a census of total Roman citizens and thus, included non-Jews.

They collected an annual [[temple tax]] from Jews both in and outside of Israel. The revolts in and suppression of diaspora communities in Egypt, Libya and Crete in 115–117 CE had a severe impact on the Jewish diaspora.

A substantial Jewish population emerged in northern Gaul by the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;Toch (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=M5oNKrvYWZAC&amp;pg=PA68 p. 68].&lt;/ref&gt; but Jewish communities existed in 465 CE in Brittany, in 524 CE in Valence, and in 533 CE in Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;'Some sources have been plainly misinterpreted, others point to "virtual" Jews, yet others to single persons not resident in the region. Thus Tyournai, Paris, Nantes, Tours, and Bourges, all localities claimed to have housed communities, have no place in the list of Jewish habitation in their period. In central Gaul Poitiers should be struck from the list, In Bordeaux it is doubtful as to the presence of a community, and only Clermont is likely to have possessed one. Further important places, like Macon, Chalon sur Saone, Vienne, and Lyon, were to be inhabited by Jews only from the Carolingian period onwards. In the south we have a Jewish population in Auch, possibly in Uzès, and in Arles, Narbonne and Marseilles. In the whole of France altogether, eight places stand scrutiny (including two questionable ones), while eight other towns have been found to lack a Jewish presence formerly claimed on insufficient evidence. Continuity of settlement from Late Antiquity throughout the Early Middle Ages is evident only in the south, in Arles and Narbonne, possibly also in Marseilles.... Between the mid-7th and the mid-8th century no sources mention Jews in Frankish lands, except for an epitaph from Narbonne and an inscription from Auch' Toch, ''The Economic History of European Jews'' pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period and into the early Middle Ages, some Jews assimilated into the dominant Greek and Latin cultures, mostly through conversion to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaye J.

Cohen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cvWq4tG4EhMC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138 ''The Beginnings of Jewishness: Boundaries, Varieties, Uncertainties''] University of California Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2014}} King [[Dagobert I]] of the [[Franks]] expelled the Jews from his [[Merovingian]] kingdom in 629. Jews in former Roman territories faced new challenges as harsher anti-Jewish Church rulings were enforced.

[[Charlemagne]]'s expansion of the Frankish empire around 800, including northern Italy and Rome, brought on a brief period of stability and unity in [[Francia]]. This created opportunities for Jewish merchants to settle again north of the Alps. Charlemagne granted the Jews freedoms similar to those once enjoyed under the [[Roman Empire]]. In addition, Jews from southern Italy, fleeing religious persecution, began to move into central Europe.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2014}} Returning to Frankish lands, many Jewish merchants took up occupations in finance and commerce, including money lending, or [[usury]]. (Church legislation banned Christians from lending money in exchange for [[interest]].) From Charlemagne's time to the present, Jewish life in northern Europe is well documented. By the 11th century, when [[Rashi]] of [[Troyes]] wrote his commentaries, Jews in what came to be known as "Ashkenaz" were known for their [[halakha|halakhic learning]], and [[Talmud|Talmudic studies]]. They were criticized by [[Sephardim]] and other Jewish scholars in Islamic lands for their lack of expertise in Jewish jurisprudence (''[[dinim]]'') and general ignorance of Hebrew linguistics and literature.&lt;ref&gt;David Malkiel, ''Reconstructing Ashkenaz: The Human Face of Franco-German Jewry, 1000–1250'' Stanford University Press, 2008 pp. 2–5, 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] emerged as a result of [[Judeo-Latin]] language contact with various [[Middle High German|High German]] [[vernacular]]s in the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Neil G.

===High and Late Middle Ages migrations===
Historical records show evidence of Jewish communities north of the [[Alps]] and [[Pyrenees]] as early as the 8th and 9th century. By the 11th century Jewish settlers, moving from southern European and Middle Eastern centers, appear to have begun to settle in the north, especially along the Rhine, often in response to new economic opportunities and at the invitation of local Christian rulers. Thus [[Baldwin V, Count of Flanders]], invited Jacob ben Yekutiel and his fellow Jews to settle in his lands; and soon after the [[Norman Conquest of England]], [[William the Conqueror]] likewise extended a welcome to continental Jews to take up residence there. Bishop [[History of the Jews in Speyer|Rüdiger Huzmann]] called on the Jews of [[Mainz]] to relocate to [[Speyer]]. In all of these decisions, the idea that Jews had the know-how and capacity to jump-start the economy, improve revenues, and enlarge trade seems to have played a prominent role.&lt;ref name="Rowe" &gt;Nina Rowe, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nD4hAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30 ''The Jew, the Cathedral and the Medieval City: Synagoga and Ecclesia in the 13th Century''] Cambridge University Press, 2011 p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically Jews relocated close to the markets and churches in town centres, where, though they came under the authority of both royal and ecclesiastical powers, they were accorded administrative autonomy.&lt;ref name="Rowe" /&gt;

In the 11th century, both [[Rabbinic Judaism]] and the culture of the Babylonian Talmud that underlies it became established in southern Italy and then spread north to Ashkenaz.&lt;ref&gt;Guenter Stemberger, "The Formation of Rabbinic Judaism, 70–640 CE" in Neusner &amp; Avery-Peck (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Judaism'', Blackwell Publishing, 2000, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous massacres of Jews occurred throughout Europe during the Christian [[Crusades]]. Inspired by the preaching of a First Crusade, crusader mobs in France and Germany perpetrated the [[Rhineland massacres]] of 1096, devastating Jewish communities along the Rhine River, including the SHuM cities of Speyer, Worms, and Mainz. The cluster of cities contain the earliest Jewish settlements north of the Alps, and played a major role in the formation of Ashkenazi Jewish religious tradition,&lt;ref name=shum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5975/|title=ShUM cities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz |first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Troyes and Sens in France. Nonetheless Jewish life in Germany persisted, while some Ashkenazi Jews joined Sephardic Jewry in Spain.&lt;ref name=ashkenazimjvl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ashkenazim|title=Ashkenazim|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expulsions from England (1290), France (1394), and parts of Germany (15th century), gradually pushed Ashkenazi Jewry eastward, to [[History of the Jews in Poland|Poland]] (10th century), [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] (10th century), and Russia (12th century). Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: [[Christian]] European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as "[[usury|usurious]]" loans)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hayim |last=Ben-Sasson |title=A History of the Jewish People |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1976 |isbn=0674397304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.

By the 15th century, the Ashkenazi Jewish communities in Poland were the largest Jewish communities of the [[Diaspora]].&lt;ref name="Ashkenazim"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Ashkenazim.html|title=Ashkenazim|first=Shira|last=Schoenberg|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=24 May 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060427032733/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Ashkenazim.html| archivedate= 27 April 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area, which eventually fell under the domination of Russia, Austria, and [[Prussia]] (Germany), would remain the main center of Ashkenazi Jewry until the [[Holocaust]].

The answer to why there was so little assimilation of Jews in central and eastern Europe for so long would seem to lie in part in the probability that the alien surroundings in central and eastern Europe were not conducive, though there was some assimilation. Furthermore, Jews lived almost exclusively in [[shtetls]], maintained a strong system of education for males, heeded rabbinic leadership, and had a very different lifestyle to that of their neighbours; and all of these tendencies increased with every outbreak of [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Louis H.

===Medieval references===
[[File:Wormsjews.jpg|thumb|Jews from [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] (Germany) wear the mandatory [[yellow badge]].]]
In the first half of the 11th century, [[Hai Gaon]] refers to questions that had been addressed to him from Ashkenaz, by which he undoubtedly means Germany. ''[[Rashi]]'' in the latter half of the 11th century refers to both the language of Ashkenaz&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Deuteronomy 3:9; idem on [[Talmud]] tractate Sukkah 17a&lt;/ref&gt; and the country of Ashkenaz.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Hullin 93a&lt;/ref&gt; During the 12th century, the word appears quite frequently. In the ''[[Mahzor Vitry]]'', the kingdom of Ashkenaz is referred to chiefly in regard to the ritual of the synagogue there, but occasionally also with regard to certain other observances.&lt;ref&gt;ib. p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

In the literature of the 13th century, references to the land and the language of Ashkenaz often occur. Examples include [[Solomon ben Aderet]]'s Responsa (vol. i., No. 395); the Responsa of [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (pp.&amp;nbsp;4, 6); his ''Halakot'' (Berakot i. 12, ed. Wilna, p.&amp;nbsp;10); the work of his son [[Jacob ben Asher]], ''Tur Orach Chayim'' (chapter 59); the Responsa of Isaac ben Sheshet (numbers 193, 268, 270).

In the ''[[Midrash]]'' compilation, ''Genesis Rabbah'', Rabbi Berechiah mentions Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah as German tribes or as German lands. It may correspond to a [[Greek language|Greek]] word that may have existed in the Greek dialect of the Jews in [[Syria Palaestina]], or the text is corrupted from "Germanica". This view of Berechiah is based on the Talmud (Yoma 10a; Jerusalem Talmud Megillah 71b), where Gomer, the father of Ashkenaz, is translated by ''Germamia'', which evidently stands for Germany, and which was suggested by the similarity of the sound.

In later times, the word Ashkenaz is used to designate southern and western Germany, the ritual of which sections differs somewhat from that of eastern Germany and Poland. Thus the prayer-book of [[Isaiah Horowitz]], and many others, give the [[piyyutim]] according to the [[Minhag]] of Ashkenaz and Poland.

According to 16th-century mystic [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm|Rabbi Elijah of Chelm]], Ashkenazi Jews lived in [[Jerusalem]] during the 11th century. The story is told that a German-speaking Jew saved the life of a young German man surnamed Dolberger. So when the knights of the [[First Crusade]] came to siege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger's family members who was among them rescued Jews in Palestine and carried them back to [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] to repay the favor.&lt;ref&gt;Seder ha-Dorot, p. 252, 1878 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of [[Halakha|halakhic]] questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, in "Monatsschrift," xlvii. 344; [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=242&amp;letter=J#928 Jerusalem: Under the Arabs]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
Material relating to the history of German Jews has been preserved in the communal accounts of certain communities on the Rhine, a ''Memorbuch'', and a ''Liebesbrief'', documents that are now part of the [[David Sassoon#Progeny|Sassoon]] Collection.&lt;ref&gt;David Solomon Sassoon, ''Ohel Dawid'' (Descriptive catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the Sassoon Library, London), vol. 1, Oxford Univ. Press: London 1932, Introduction p. xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Graetz]] has also added to the history of German Jewry in modern times in the abstract of his seminal work, ''History of the Jews'', which he entitled "Volksthümliche Geschichte der Juden."

Elazar|accessdate=24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarized the demographic history of Ashkenazi Jews in the last thousand years, noting that at the end of the 11th century, 97% of world Jewry was Sephardic and 3% Ashkenazi; by the end of the 16th century, the: 'Treaty on the redemption of captives', by Gracian of the God's Mother, Mercy Priest, who was imprisoned by Turks, cites a Tunisian Hebrew, made captive when arriving to Gaeta, who aided others with money, named: 'Simon Escanasi', in the mid-17th century, "Sephardim still outnumbered Ashkenazim three to two", but by the end of the 18th century, "Ashkenazim outnumbered Sephardim three to two, the result of improved living conditions in Christian Europe versus the Ottoman Muslim world."&lt;ref name="sephardic"/&gt; By 1930, [[Arthur Ruppin]] estimated that Ashkenazi Jews accounted for nearly 92% of world Jewry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These factors are sheer demography showing the migration patterns of Jews from Southern and Western Europe to Central and Eastern Europe.

In 1740 a family from Lithuania became the first Ashkenazi Jews to settle in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzman, Don (1970) ''Genesis 1948. The First Arab-Israeli War.'' An Nal Book, New York. Library of Congress number 77-96925. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

In the generations after emigration from the west, Jewish communities in places like Poland, Russia, and Belarus enjoyed a comparatively stable socio-political environment. A thriving publishing industry and the printing of hundreds of biblical commentaries precipitated the development of the [[Hasidic]] movement as well as major Jewish academic centers.&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, Edward. "Post-medieval Jewish Interpretation." ''The Jewish Study Bible''. Ed. [[Adele Berlin]] and [[Marc Zvi Brettler]]. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; After two centuries of comparative tolerance in the new nations, massive westward emigration occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries in response to [[pogrom]]s in the east and the economic opportunities offered in other parts of the world. Ashkenazi Jews have made up the majority of the [[American Jew]]ish community since 1750.&lt;ref name="Ashkenazim"/&gt;

In the context of the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Jewish emancipation began in 18th century France and spread throughout Western and Central Europe. [[Disabilities (Jewish)|Disabilities]] that had limited the rights of Jews since the Middle Ages were abolished, including the requirements to wear distinctive clothing, pay special taxes, and live in [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghettos]] isolated from non-Jewish communities, and the prohibitions on certain professions. Laws were passed to integrate Jews into their host countries, forcing Ashkenazi Jews to adopt family names (they had formerly used [[patronymics]]). Newfound inclusion into public life led to cultural growth in the ''[[Haskalah]]'', or Jewish Enlightenment, with its goal of integrating modern European values into Jewish life.&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, 1901&lt;/ref&gt; As a reaction to increasing antisemitism and assimilation following the emancipation, [[Zionism]] was developed in central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;"Jews", William Bridgwater, ed. ''The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia''; second ed., New York: Dell Publishing Co., 1964; p. 906.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jews, particularly those in the [[Pale of Settlement]], turned to [[socialism]]. These tendencies would be united in [[Labor Zionism]], the founding ideology of the State of Israel.

====The Holocaust====
[[File:Lviv pogrom (June - July 1941).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Jewish woman chased by men and youth armed with clubs during the [[Lviv pogroms]], July 1941, then [[occupied Poland]], now Ukraine]]
Of the estimated 8.8 million Jews living in Europe at the beginning of [[World War II]], the majority of whom were Ashkenazi, about 6 million – more than two-thirds – were systematically murdered in [[the Holocaust]]. These included 3 million of 3.3 million [[Polish Jews]] (91%); 900,000 of 1.5 million in [[Ukraine]] (60%); and 50–90% of the Jews of other Slavic nations, Germany, Hungary, and the Baltic states, and over 25% of the Jews in France. Sephardi communities suffered similar depletions in a few countries, including Greece, the Netherlands and the former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/killedtable.html|title=Estimated Number of Jews Killed in The Final Solution|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=24 May 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060428075345/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/killedtable.html| archivedate= 28 April 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the large majority of the victims were Ashkenazi Jews, their percentage dropped from an estimate of 92% of world Jewry in made in 1930&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to nearly 80% of world Jewry today. The Holocaust also effectively put an end to the dynamic development of the Yiddish language in the [[Yiddish Renaissance|previous decades]], as the vast majority of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, around 5 million, were Yiddish speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon Birnbaum|Solomo Birnbaum]], ''Grammatik der jiddischen Sprache'' (4., erg.

Following the Holocaust, some sources place Ashkenazim today as making up approximately 83–85 percent of Jews worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Gershon Shafir, Yoav Peled, ''Being Israeli: The Dynamics of Multiple Citizenship'' Cambridge University Press 2002 p. 324 'The Zionist movement was a European movement in its goals and orientation and its target population was Ashkenazi Jews who constituted, in 1895, 90 percent of the 10.5 million Jews then living in the world (Smooha 1978: 51).'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 'Today Ashkenazim constitute more than 80 percent of all the Jews in the world, vastly outnumbering Sephardic Jews.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asher Arian (1981) in Itamar Rabinovich, Jehuda Reinharz, ''Israel in the Middle East: Documents and Readings on Society, Politics, and Foreign Relations, pre-1948 to the present'' UPNE/Brandeis University Press 2008 p. 324 "About 85 percent of the world's Jews are Ashkenazi"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Whitten Smith, Elizabeth Geraldine Burr, ''Understanding World Religions: A Road Map for Justice and Peace'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007 p. 72 'Before the German Holocaust, about 90% of Jews worldwide were Ashkenazim.

====Israel====
{{Main|Ashkenazi Jews in Israel}}

In Israel, the term ''Ashkenazi'' is now used in a manner unrelated to its original meaning, often applied to all Jews who settled in Europe and sometimes including those whose ethnic background is actually Sephardic. Jews of any non-Ashkenazi background, including Mizrahi, Yemenite, Kurdish and others who have no connection with the [[Iberian Peninsula]], have similarly come to be lumped together as Sephardic. Jews of mixed background are increasingly common, partly because of intermarriage between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi, and partly because many do not see such historic markers as relevant to their life experiences as Jews.&lt;ref name="meyers"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/22872/are-israel-s-marriage-laws-archaic-and-irrelevant/|title=Are Israel's Marriage Laws 'Archaic and Irrelevant'?|last=Meyers|first=Nechemia|date=12 July 1997|publisher=Jewish News Weekly|accessdate=17 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious Ashkenazi Jews living in Israel are obliged to follow the authority of the chief Ashkenazi rabbi in [[halakha|halakhic]] matters. In this respect, a religiously Ashkenazi Jew is an Israeli who is more likely to support certain religious interests in Israel, including certain political parties. These political parties result from the fact that a portion of the Israeli electorate votes for Jewish religious parties; although the electoral map changes from one election to another, there are generally several small parties associated with the interests of religious Ashkenazi Jews. The role of religious parties, including small religious parties that play important roles as coalition members, results in turn from Israel's composition as a complex society in which competing social, economic, and religious interests stand for election to the [[Knesset]], a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature with 120 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Field Listing - Legislative Branch |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2101.html|work=[[World Fact Book]] |publisher=CIA |accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashkenazi Jews have played a prominent role in the economy, media, and politics&lt;ref&gt;{{As of|2013}}, every [[President of Israel]] since the country's foundation in 1948 has been an Ashkenazi Jew&lt;/ref&gt; of Israel since its founding. During the first decades of Israel as a state, strong cultural conflict occurred between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews (mainly east European Ashkenazim). The roots of this conflict, which still exists to a much smaller extent in present-day Israeli society, are chiefly attributed to the concept of the "[[melting pot]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Liphshiz|first=Cnaan|title=Melting pot' approach in the army was a mistake, says IDF absorption head|url=http://www.haaretz.com/melting-pot-approach-in-the-army-was-a-mistake-says-idf-absorption-head-1.245477|accessdate=8 November 2013|newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=9 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, all Jewish immigrants who arrived in Israel were strongly encouraged to "melt down" their own particular exilic identities within the general social "pot" in order to become Israeli.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhaki, Shlomo and Schechtman, Edna''The "Melting Pot": A Success Story?''

==Definition==
{{see also|Who is a Jew?}}

===By religion===
Religious Jews have [[Minhag]]im, customs, in addition to [[Halakha]], or religious law, and different interpretations of law. Different groups of religious Jews in different geographic areas historically adopted different customs and interpretations. On certain issues, Orthodox Jews are required to follow the customs of their ancestors, and do not believe they have the option of picking and choosing. For this reason, observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household's religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow. These times include, for example, when two Jews of different ethnic background marry, when a non-Jew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time, or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family's past. In this sense, "Ashkenazic" refers both to a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry. [[Reform Judaism]], which does not necessarily follow those minhagim, did nonetheless originate among Ashkenazi Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Origins_of_Reform_Judaism.html "The Origins of Reform Judaism."] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a religious sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is any Jew whose family tradition and ritual follows Ashkenazi practice. Until the Ashkenazi community first began to develop in the [[Early Middle Ages]], the centers of Jewish religious authority were in the Islamic world, at [[Baghdad]] and in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]]. Ashkenaz (Germany) was so distant geographically that it developed a ''[[minhag]]'' of its own. Ashkenazi Hebrew came to be pronounced in ways distinct from other forms of Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/hebpronunciation.html "Pronunciations of Hebrew."] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is [[Sephardic]], since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or [[Mizrahi]] woman who marries into an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a [[Sephardi]] or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] generally follows the practice of the [[beth din]] that converted him or her. With the integration of Jews from around the world in Israel, North America, and other places, the religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside [[Orthodox Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lieberman |first=Asaf |url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/the-unbearable-lightness-of-being-ashkenazi.premium-1.494628 |title=The unbearable lightness of being Ashkenazi. |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New developments in Judaism often transcend differences in religious practice between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. In North American cities, social trends such as the [[chavurah|chavurah movement]], and the emergence of "post-denominational Judaism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rosenthal, Rachel |title=What's in a name? |journal=Kedma |year=2006 |issue=Winter 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jewschool.com/THE_NEW_JEW.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050923030838/http://www.jewschool.com/THE_NEW_JEW.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2005 |title=Uncovering the Un-Movement |last1=Greenberg |first1=Richard |first2=Debra Nussbaum |last2=Cohen |work=[[B'nai B'rith|B'nai B'rith Magazine]] |date=Fall 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; often bring together younger Jews of diverse ethnic backgrounds. In recent years, there has been increased interest in ''[[Kabbalah]]'', which many Ashkenazi Jews study outside of the [[Yeshiva]] framework. Another trend is the new popularity of [[ecstatic]] worship in the [[Jewish Renewal]] movement and the [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Carlebach]] style [[minyan]], both of which are nominally of Ashkenazi origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kehilathadar.org/Aboutus/forward08-10-01.html|date=10 August 2001|title=Any Old Shul Won't Do for the Young and Cool|first=Rachel|last=Donadio|accessdate=24 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061007113608/http://www.kehilathadar.org/Aboutus/forward08-10-01.html |archivedate = 7 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By culture===
{{Multiple issues|section=April 2017|
{{Importance section|date=June 2014}}

}}
Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of ''[[Yiddishkeit]]'', which means "Jewishness" in the [[Yiddish language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Yiddishkeit?|url=http://www.ocyiddish.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9&amp;Itemid=11|accessdate=8 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126124833/http://ocyiddish.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9&amp;Itemid=11|archivedate=26 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yiddishkeit'' is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews.&lt;ref name="www.rrc.edu"&gt;{{cite web |last=Weiner|first=Ben|title=Reconstructing Yiddishkeit|url=http://www.rrc.edu/sites/default/files/primary_navigation/resources/Zeke/Ben_Weiner_Zeek_Fall10.pdf|work=[[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]]|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Haskalah]] and the [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipation of Jews]] in Europe, this meant the study of [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]] for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the [[Rhineland]] to [[Riga]] to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, ''Yiddishkeit'' now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and [[Hasidism]], but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, ''Yiddishkeit'' can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.

As Ashkenazi Jews moved away from Europe, mostly in the form of [[aliyah]] to Israel, or immigration to North America, and other English-speaking areas such as [[South Africa]]; and Europe (particularly France) and [[Latin America]], the geographic isolation that gave rise to Ashkenazim has given way to mixing with other cultures, and with non-Ashkenazi Jews who, similarly, are no longer isolated in distinct geographic locales. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] has replaced Yiddish as the primary [[Jewish language]] for many Ashkenazi Jews, although many [[Hasidic]] and [[Hareidi]] groups continue to use Yiddish in daily life. (There are numerous Ashkenazi Jewish anglophones and Russian-speakers as well, although English and Russian are not originally Jewish languages.)

France's blended Jewish community is typical of the cultural recombination that is going on among Jews throughout the world. Although France expelled its original Jewish population in the [[Middle Ages]], by the time of the [[French Revolution]], there were two distinct Jewish populations. One consisted of Sephardic Jews, originally refugees from the [[Inquisition]] and concentrated in the southwest, while the other community was Ashkenazi, concentrated in formerly German [[Alsace]], and mainly speaking a German dialect similar to Yiddish. (A third community of Provençal Jews living in [[Comtat Venaissin]] were technically outside France, and were later absorbed into the Sephardim.) The two communities were so separate and different that the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] emancipated them separately in 1790 and 1791.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06791.html "French Revolution."] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 2008. 29 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

But after emancipation, a sense of a unified French Jewry emerged, especially when France was wracked by the [[Dreyfus affair]] in the 1890s. In the 1920s and 1930s, Ashkenazi Jews from Europe arrived in large numbers as refugees from [[antisemitism]], the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]], and the economic turmoil of the [[Great Depression]]. By the 1930s, [[Paris]] had a vibrant Yiddish culture, and many Jews were involved in diverse political movements. After the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] years and the [[Holocaust]], the French Jewish population was augmented once again, first by Ashkenazi refugees from Central Europe, and later by Sephardi immigrants and refugees from [[North Africa]], many of them [[francophone]].

Then, in the 1990s, yet another Ashkenazi Jewish wave began to arrive from countries of the former [[Soviet Union]] and Central Europe. The result is a pluralistic Jewish community that still has some distinct elements of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic culture. But in France, it is becoming much more difficult to sort out the two, and a distinctly French Jewishness has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Irwin. (2002) "Remaking Jewish Identity in France", in Howard Wettstein, ''Diaspora's and Exiles''. University of California Press, pp. 164–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===By ethnicity===
In an ethnic sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is one whose ancestry can be traced to the Jews who settled in Central Europe. For roughly a thousand years, the Ashkenazim were a reproductively isolated population in Europe, despite living in many countries, with little inflow or outflow from migration, conversion, or intermarriage with other groups, including other Jews. Human geneticists have argued that genetic variations have been identified that show high frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews, but not in the general European population, be they for patrilineal markers ([[Y-chromosome]] [[haplotype]]s) and for matrilineal markers ([[mitochondrion|mitotypes]]).&lt;ref name=WadeNYT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/science/14gene.html |title=New Light on Origins of Ashkenazi in Europe |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 January 2006 |accessdate=24 May 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210152054/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/science/14gene.html| archivedate=10 December 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the middle of the 20th century, many Ashkenazi Jews have intermarried, both with members of other Jewish communities and with people of other nations and faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/09/science/y-chromosome-bears-witness-to-story-of-the-jewish-diaspora.html |title=Y Chromosome Bears Witness to Story of the Jewish Diaspora |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 May 2000 |first=Nicholas |last=Wade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort&amp;nbsp;– that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.&lt;ref name="pmid17044734"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Seldin MF, Shigeta R, Villoslada P |title=European population substructure: clustering of northern and southern populations |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=e143 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17044734 |pmc=1564423 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020143 |url=http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020143 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709050812/http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020143 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-09 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customs, laws and traditions==
The ''[[Halakha|Halakhic]]'' practices of ([[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]) Ashkenazi Jews may differ from those of [[Sephardi Jews]], particularly in matters of custom. Differences are noted in the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' itself, in the gloss of [[Moses Isserles]]. Well known differences in practice include:

[[File:Prager Beerdigungsbruderschaft.jpg|thumb|The example of the ''[[chevra kadisha]]'', the Jewish burial society, Prague, 1772]]
* Observance of ''[[Passover|Pesach]]'' (Passover): Ashkenazi Jews traditionally refrain from eating [[legumes]], grain, [[millet]], and [[rice]] ([[quinoa]], however, has become accepted as foodgrain in the North American communities), whereas Sephardi Jews typically do not prohibit these foods.
* Ashkenazi Jews freely mix and eat fish and milk products; some Sephardic Jews refrain from doing so.
* Ashkenazim are more permissive toward the usage of [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] as a hair covering for married and widowed women.
* In the case of ''[[kashrut]]'' for meat, conversely, Sephardi Jews have stricter requirements&amp;nbsp;– this level is commonly referred to as ''[[Beth Yoseph|Beth Yosef]]''. Meat products that are acceptable to Ashkenazi Jews as kosher may therefore be rejected by Sephardi Jews. Notwithstanding stricter requirements for the actual slaughter, Sephardi Jews permit the rear portions of an animal after proper [[Halakha|Halakhic]] removal of the [[sciatic nerve]], while many Ashkenazi Jews do not. This is not because of different interpretations of the law; rather, slaughterhouses could not find adequate skills for correct removal of the sciatic nerve and found it more economical to separate the hindquarters and sell them as non-kosher meat.
* Ashkenazi Jews often name newborn children after deceased family members, but not after living relatives. Sephardi Jews, in contrast, often name their children after the children's grandparents, even if those grandparents are still living. A notable exception to this generally reliable rule is among [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], where Ashkenazim for centuries used the naming conventions otherwise attributed exclusively to Sephardim such as [[Chuts]].
* Ashkenazi [[tefillin]] bear some differences from Sephardic tefillin. In the traditional Ashkenazic rite, the tefillin are wound towards the body, not away from it. Ashkenazim traditionally don tefillin while standing, whereas other Jews generally do so while sitting down.
* Ashkenazic traditional pronunciations of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] differ from those of other groups. The most prominent consonantal difference from Sephardic and Mizrahic Hebrew dialects is the pronunciation of the Hebrew letter [[Taw (letter)|tav]] in certain Hebrew words (historically, in postvocalic undoubled context) as an /s/ and not a /t/ or /θ/ sound. {{further|Ashkenazi Hebrew}}
* The prayer shawl, or [[tallit]] (or tallis in Ashkenazi Hebrew), is worn by the majority of Ashkenazi men after marriage, but western European Ashkenazi men wear it from Bar Mitzvah. In Sephardi or Mizrahi Judaism, the prayer shawl is commonly worn from early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/things/tallit.htm |title=''Tallit: Jewish Prayer Shawl'' |publisher=Religionfacts.com |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ashkenazic liturgy===
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|ethnicities}}
The term ''Ashkenazi'' also refers to the ''[[nusach Ashkenaz]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], "liturgical tradition", or rite) used by Ashkenazi [[Jew]]s in their ''[[Siddur]]'' (prayer book). A ''nusach'' is defined by a liturgical tradition's choice of prayers, the order of prayers, the text of prayers, and melodies used in the singing of prayers. Two other major forms of nusach among Ashkenazic Jews are [[Nusach Sefard]] (not to be confused with [[Sephardic law and customs|the Sephardic ritual]]), which is the general Polish Hasidic nusach, and [[Nusach Ari]], as used by Lubavitch Hasidim.

===Ashkenazi as a surname===
Several famous people have [[Ashkenazi (surname)|Ashkenazi as a surname]], such as [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]. However, most people with this surname hail from within Sephardic communities, particularly from the [[Syrian Jew]]ish community. The Sephardic carriers of the surname would have some Ashkenazi ancestors since the surname was adopted by families who were initially of Ashkenazic origins who moved to Sephardi countries and joined those communities. Ashkenazi would be formally adopted as the family surname having started off as a nickname imposed by their adopted communities. Some have shortened the name to Ash.

==Genetics==
===Genetic origins===
{{main|Genetic studies on Jews}}
Efforts to identify the origins of Ashkenazi Jews through DNA analysis began in the 1990s. Currently, there are three types of genetic origin testing, autosomal DNA (atDNA), mitochondrial DNA ([[mtDNA]]), and Y-chromosomal DNA ([[Y-DNA]]). Autosomal DNA is a mixture from an individual's entire ancestry, Y-DNA shows a male's lineage only along his strict paternal line, mtDNA shows any person's lineage only along the strict maternal line. [[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]] have also been employed to yield findings relevant to genetic origins.

Like most DNA studies of human migration patterns, the earliest studies on Ashkenazi Jews focused on the Y-DNA and mtDNA segments of the human genome. Both segments are unaffected by [[recombination (biology)|recombination]] (except for the ends of the Y chromosome – the [[pseudoautosomal region]]s known as PAR1 and PAR2), thus allowing tracing of direct maternal and paternal lineages.

These studies revealed that Ashkenazi Jews originate from an ancient (2000 BCE – 700 BCE) population of the Middle East who had spread to Europe.&lt;ref name="tony-frudakis-book"&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Photofitting: Predicting Ancestry and Phenotype Using DNA |author=Tony Nick Frudakis |page=383 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9vXeydpj7VkC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=ashkenazi+jews+middle+eastern+origin+bronze+age#v=onepage&amp;q=ashkenazi%20jews%20middle%20eastern%20origin%20bronze%20age |isbn=978-0080551371 |date=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ashkenazic Jews display the homogeneity of a [[Population bottleneck|genetic bottleneck]], meaning they descend from a larger population whose numbers were greatly reduced but recovered through a few founding individuals.
Although the Jewish people, in general, were present across a wide geographical area as described, genetic research done by Gil Atzmon of the Longevity Genes Project at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] suggests "that Ashkenazim branched off from other Jews around the time of the destruction of the First Temple, 2,500 years ago ... flourished during the Roman Empire but then went through a 'severe bottleneck' as they dispersed, reducing a population of several million to just 400 families who left Northern Italy around the year 1000 for Central and eventually Eastern Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What Do a Bunch of Old Jews Know About Living Forever? |author=Jesse Green |work=New York Magazine|date=6 November 2011|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/ashkenazi-jews-2011-11/ |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various studies have arrived at diverging conclusions regarding both the degree and the sources of the non-Levantine [[Miscegenation|admixture]] in Ashkenazim,&lt;ref name="Summary of Recent Genetic Studies"/&gt; particularly with respect to the extent of the non-Levantine genetic origin observed in Ashkenazi maternal lineages, which is in contrast to the predominant Levantine genetic origin observed in Ashkenazi paternal lineages. All studies nevertheless agree that genetic overlap with the [[Fertile Crescent]] exists in both lineages, albeit at differing rates. Collectively, Ashkenazi Jews are less genetically diverse than other [[Jewish ethnic divisions]], due to their genetic bottleneck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bloch|first=Talia|title=The Other Jewish Genetic Diseases|url=http://forward.com/articles/112426/the-other-jewish-genetic-diseases/|accessdate=8 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]|date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[haplotypes]] of the Y-chromosome, published in 2000, addressed the paternal origins of Ashkenazi Jews. Hammer ''et al.''&lt;ref name="hammer"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations share a common pool of Y-chromosome biallelic haplotypes|first=M.

This suggested that the male ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to the Middle East. The proportion of male [[genetic admixture]] in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations, with "relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim," and a total admixture estimate "very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%." This supported the finding that "Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the [[Near East]] resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors." "Past research found that 50–80 percent of DNA from the Ashkenazi Y chromosome, which is used to trace the male lineage, originated in the Near East," Richards said.
The population has subsequently spread out.

A 2001 study by Nebel ''et al.'' showed that both Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish populations share the same overall paternal Near Eastern ancestries. In comparison with data available from other relevant populations in the region, Jews were found to be more closely related to groups in the north of the Fertile Crescent. The authors also report on Eu 19 ([[R1a]]) chromosomes, which are very frequent in Central and Eastern Europeans (54–60%) at elevated frequency (13%) in Ashkenazi Jews. They hypothesized that the differences among Ashkenazim Jews could reflect low-level gene flow from surrounding European populations or genetic drift during isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 1274378|year = 2001|last1 = Nebel|first1 = A.|title = The y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East|journal = American Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 69|issue = 5|pages = 1095–1112|last2 = Filon|first2 = D.|last3 = Brinkmann|first3 = B.|last4 = Majumder|first4 = P.

====Female lineages: Mitochondrial DNA====
Before 2006, geneticists had largely attributed the [[ethnogenesis]] of most of the [[Jewish ethnic divisions|world's Jewish populations]], including Ashkenazi Jews, to Israelite Jewish male migrants from the Middle East and "the women from each local population whom they took as wives and converted to Judaism." Thus, in 2002, in line with this model of origin, David Goldstein, now of Duke University, reported that unlike male Ashkenazi lineages, the female lineages in Ashkenazi Jewish communities "did not seem to be Middle Eastern", and that each community had its own genetic pattern and even that "in some cases the mitochondrial DNA was closely related to that of the host community." In his view, this suggested, "that Jewish men had arrived from the Middle East, taken wives from the host population and converted them to Judaism, after which there was no further intermarriage with non-Jews."&lt;ref name=WadeNYT/&gt;

In 2006, a study by Behar ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="behar"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/43026_doron.pdf |title=The Matrilineal Ancestry of Ashkenazi Jewry: Portrait of a Recent Founder Event |first=Doron M. |last=Behar |author2=Ene Metspalu |author3=Toomas Kivisild |author4=Alessandro Achilli |author5=Yarin Hadid |author6=Shay Tzur |author7=Luisa Pereira |author8=Antonio Amorim |author9=Lluı's Quintana-Murci |author10=Kari Majamaa |author11=Corinna Herrnstadt |author12=Neil Howell |author13=Oleg Balanovsky |author14=Ildus Kutuev |author15=Andrey Pshenichnov |author16=David Gurwitz |author17=Batsheva Bonne-Tamir |author18=Antonio Torroni |author19=Richard Villems |author20=Karl Skorecki |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |date=March 2006 |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=487–97 |pmid=16404693 |doi=10.1086/500307 |format=PDF |accessdate=30 December 2008 |pmc=1380291 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202030339/http://www.ftdna.com/pdf/43026_Doron.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on what was at that time high-resolution analysis of [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|haplogroup K]] (mtDNA), suggested that about 40% of the current Ashkenazi population is descended matrilineally from just four women, or "founder lineages", that were "likely from a [[Hebrews|Hebrew]]/[[Levant]]ine mtDNA pool" originating in the Middle East in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. Additionally, Behar ''et al.'' suggested that the rest of Ashkenazi mtDNA is originated from ~150 women, and that most of those were also likely of Middle Eastern origin.&lt;ref name="behar"/&gt; In reference specifically to Haplogroup K, they suggested that although it is common throughout western Eurasia, "the observed global pattern of distribution renders very unlikely the possibility that the four aforementioned founder lineages entered the Ashkenazi mtDNA pool via gene flow from a European host population".

In 2013, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the [[University of Huddersfield]] in England reached different conclusions, in line with the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past&lt;ref name=NYTimesEuropeanWomen&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/science/ashkenazi-origins-may-be-with-european-women-study-finds.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Genes Suggest European Women at Root of Ashkenazi Family Tree |author=Nicholas Wade |date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry.

A 2014 study by Fernández et al. found that Ashkenazi Jews display a frequency of haplogroup K in their maternal DNA, suggesting an ancient Near Eastern matrilineal origin, similar to the results of the Behar study in 2006. Fernández noted that this observation clearly contradicts the results of the 2013 study led by Richards that suggested a European source for 3 exclusively Ashkenazi K lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1004401 |title=Ancient DNA Analysis of 8000 B.C.

====Association and linkage studies====
In [[genetic epidemiology]], a [[genome-wide association study]] (GWA study, or GWAS) is an examination of all or most of the genes (the genome) of different individuals of a particular species to see how much the genes vary from individual to individual. These techniques were originally designed for epidemiological uses, to identify genetic associations with observable traits.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.299.11.1335| volume=299| issue=11| pages=1335–44 |author=Pearson TA, Manolio TA |title=How to interpret a genome-wide association study| journal=JAMA|year=2008 |pmid=18349094 | url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/299/11/1335| last2=Manolio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study by Seldin et al. used over five thousand autosomal SNPs to demonstrate European genetic substructure. The results showed "a consistent and reproducible distinction between 'northern' and 'southern' European population groups". Most northern, central, and eastern Europeans (Finns, Swedes, English, Irish, Germans, and Ukrainians) showed &gt;90% in the "northern" population group, while most individual participants with southern European ancestry (Italians, Greeks, Portuguese, Spaniards) showed &gt;85% in the "southern" group. Both Ashkenazi Jews as well as Sephardic Jews showed &gt;85% membership in the "southern" group. Referring to the Jews clustering with southern Europeans, the authors state the results were "consistent with a later Mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups".&lt;ref name="pmid17044734" /&gt;

A 2007 study by Bauchet et al. found that Ashkenazi Jews were most closely clustered with Arabic North African populations when compared to Global population, and in the European structure analysis, they share similarities only with Greeks and Southern Italians, reflecting their east Mediterranean origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenberg |first=Noah A. |year=2002 |title=Genetic structure of human populations |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=298 |issue=5602 |pages=2381–85 |doi=10.1126/science.1078311 |pmid=12493913 |bibcode=2002Sci...298.2381R |first2=Jonathan K |last2=Pritchard |first3=JL |last3=Weber |last4=Cann |first4=HM |last5=Kidd |first5=KK |last6=Zhivotovsky |first6=LA |last7=Feldman |first7=MW|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bauchet |first=Marc |year=2007 |title=Measuring European Population Stratification with Microarray Genotype Data |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=948–56 |doi=10.1086/513477 |pmid=17436249 |pmc=1852743 |first2=Brian |last2=McEvoy |last3=Pearson |first3=Laurel N. |last4=Quillen |first4=Ellen E. |last5=Sarkisian |first5=Tamara |last6=Hovhannesyan |first6=Kristine |last7=Deka |first7=Ranjan |last8=Bradley |first8=Daniel G. |last9=Shriver |first9=Mark D. |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study on Jewish ancestry by Atzmon-Ostrer et al. stated "Two major groups were identified by principal component, phylogenetic, and identity by descent (IBD) analysis: Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews. The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry", as both groups – the Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews – shared common ancestors in the Middle East about 2500 years ago. The study examines genetic markers spread across the entire genome and shows that the Jewish groups (Ashkenazi and non Ashkenazi) share large swaths of DNA, indicating close relationships and that each of the Jewish groups in the study (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek and Ashkenazi) has its own genetic signature but is more closely related to the other Jewish groups than to their fellow non-Jewish countrymen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/59938/title/Tracing_Jewish_roots |title=Tracing Jewish roots |first=Tina Hesman |last=Saey |work=ScienceNews |date=3 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atzmon's team found that the SNP markers in genetic segments of 3 million DNA letters or longer were 10 times more likely to be identical among Jews than non-Jews. Results of the analysis also tally with biblical accounts of the fate of the Jews. The study also found that with respect to non-Jewish European groups, the population most closely related to Ashkenazi Jews are modern-day Italians. The study speculated that the genetic-similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and Italians may be due to inter-marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman Empire. It was also found that any two Ashkenazi Jewish participants in the study shared about as much DNA as fourth or fifth cousins.&lt;ref name="Atzmon2010"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Gil |last1=Atzmon |first2=Li |last2=Hao |first3=Itsik |last3=Pe'Er |first4=Christopher |last4=Velez |first5=Alexander |last5=Pearlman |first6=Pier Francesco |last6=Palamara|first7=Bernice |last7=Morrow |first8=Eitan |last8=Friedman |first9=Carole |last9=Oddoux |first10=Edward |last10=Burns |first11=Harry |last11 =Ostrer |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Abraham's Children in the Genome Era: Major Jewish Diaspora Populations Comprise Distinct Genetic Clusters with Shared Middle Eastern Ancestry |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=86 |issue=6 |pages=850–59 |year=2010 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2010.04.015 |pmid=20560205 |pmc=3032072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Genes Set Jews Apart, Study Finds|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/science/pub/-674|accessdate=8 November 2013|newspaper=[[American Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by Bray et al., using [[SNP array|SNP]] [[DNA microarray|microarray]] techniques and [[linkage analysis]] found that when assuming [[Druze]] and [[Palestinian Arabs|Palestinian Arab]] populations to represent the reference to world Jewry ancestor genome, between 35 and 55 percent of the modern Ashkenazi genome can possibly be of European origin, and that European "admixture is considerably higher than previous estimates by studies that used the Y chromosome" with this reference point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-ashkenazi-jews-dna-diseases-20140909-story.html|title=DNA ties Ashkenazi Jews to group of just 330 people from Middle Ages|last=Kaplan|first=Karen|date=2014-09-09|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming this reference point the linkage disequilibrium in the Ashkenazi Jewish population was interpreted as "matches signs of interbreeding or 'admixture' between Middle Eastern and European populations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Signatures of founder effects, admixture, and selection in the Ashkenazi Jewish population |first=Steven M. |last=Bray |first2=Jennifer G. |last2=Mulle |first3=Anne F. |last3=Dodd |first4=Ann E. |last4=Pulver |first5=Stephen |last5=Wooding |first6=Stephen T. |last6=Warren |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume=107|issue=37 |pages=16222–27 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1004381107 |year=2010 |pmid=20798349|bibcode=2010PNAS..10716222B |pmc=2941333}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Bray et al. tree, Ashkenazi Jews were found to be a genetically more divergent population than [[Russians]], [[Orcadians]], [[French people|French]], [[Basques]], [[Sardinians]], [[Italians]] and [[Tuscany|Tuscans]]. The study also observed that Ashkenazim are more diverse than their Middle Eastern relatives, which was counterintuitive because Ashkenazim are supposed to be a subset, not a superset, of their assumed geographical source population. Bray et al. therefore postulate that these results reflect not the population antiquity but a history of mixing between genetically distinct populations in Europe. However, it's possible that the relaxation of marriage prescription in the ancestors of Ashkenazim that drove their heterozygosity up, while the maintenance of the [[Cousin marriage in the Middle East|FBD rule]] in native Middle Easterners have been keeping their heterozygosity values in check. Ashkenazim distinctiveness as found in the Bray et al. study, therefore, may come from their ethnic endogamy (ethnic inbreeding), which allowed them to "mine" their ancestral gene pool in the context of relative reproductive isolation from European neighbors, and not from clan endogamy (clan inbreeding). Consequently, their higher diversity compared to Middle Easterners stems from the latter's marriage practices, not necessarily from the former's admixture with Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthropogenesis.kinshipstudies.org/2012/07/how-to-interpret-patterns-of-genetic-variation-admixture-divergence-inbreeding/ |title=How to Interpret Patterns of Genetic Variation?

The genome-wide genetic study carried out in 2010 by Behar et al. examined the genetic relationships among all major Jewish groups, including Ashkenazim, as well as the genetic relationship between these Jewish groups and non-Jewish ethnic populations. The study found that contemporary Jews (excluding Indian and Ethiopian Jews) have a close genetic relationship with people from the Levant. The authors explained that "the most parsimonious explanation for these observations is a common genetic origin, which is consistent with an historical formulation of the Jewish people as descending from ancient [[Hebrew]] and [[Israelite]] residents of the Levant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bhusers.upf.edu/dcomas/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Behar2010.pdf |title=The genome-wide structure of the Jewish people |format=PDF |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume= 466|issue=7303 |date=8 July 2010 |pages=238–42 |first1=Doron M. |last1=Behar |first2=Bayazit |last2=Yunusbayev |first3=Mait |last3=Metspalu |first4=Ene |last4=Metspalu |first5=Saharon |last5=Rosset |first6=Jüri |last6=Parik |first7=Siiri |last7=Rootsi |first8=Gyaneshwer |last8=Chaubey |first9=Ildus |last9=Kutuev |first10=Guennady |last10=Yudkovsky |first11=Elza K. |last11=Khusnutdinova |first12=Oleg |last12=Balanovsky |first13=Ornella |last13=Semino |first14=Luisa |last14=Pereira |first15=David |last15=Comas |first16=David |last16=Gurwitz |first17=Batsheva |last17=Bonne-Tamir |first18=Tudor |last18=Parfitt |first19=Michael F. |last19=Hammer |first20=Karl |last20=Skorecki |first21=Richard |last21=Villems |doi=10.1038/nature09103 |accessdate=2013-09-04 |pmid=20531471|bibcode = 2010Natur.466..238B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Khazar hypothesis===
{{Main|Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry}}
In the late 19th century, it was proposed that the core of today's Ashkenazi Jewry are genetically descended from a [[Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry|hypothetical Khazarian Jewish diaspora]] who had migrated westward from modern Russia and Ukraine into modern France and Germany (as opposed to the currently held theory that Jews migrated from France and Germany into Eastern Europe). The hypothesis is not corroborated by historical sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hGILHIgEl7cC&amp;q=any_historical#v=snippet|title=The Karaites of Galicia: An Ethnoreligious Minority Among the Ashkenazim, the Turks, and the Slavs, 1772–1945|first=Mikhail|last=Kizilov|date=2 July 2018|publisher=Brill|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is unsubstantiated by genetics, but it is still occasionally supported by scholars who have had some success in keeping the theory in the academic consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubin|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has sometimes been used by Jewish authors such as [[Arthur Koestler]] as part of an argument against traditional forms of antisemitism (for example the claim that "the Jews killed Christ"), just as similar arguments have been advanced on behalf of the [[Crimean Karaites]]. Today, however, the theory is more often associated with [[antisemitism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1992|p=242}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[anti-Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vogt|1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iJN90t2gN6hxGiFQuBv-gYQE060w?docId=CNG.52483183e4e0f60d963361c17572c848.81 |title=Gene study settles debate over origin of European Jews |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=16 January 2013 |access-date=2013-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601233030/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iJN90t2gN6hxGiFQuBv-gYQE060w?docId=CNG.52483183e4e0f60d963361c17572c848.81 |archive-date=1 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 trans-genome study carried out by 30 geneticists, from 13 universities and academies, from 9 countries, assembling the largest data set available to date, for assessment of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic origins found no evidence of Khazar origin among Ashkenazi Jews. "Thus, analysis of Ashkenazi Jews together with a large sample from the region of the Khazar Khaganate corroborates the earlier results that Ashkenazi Jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the Middle East and Europe, that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other Jewish populations, and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the Caucasus region", the authors concluded.&lt;ref name = "WayneState2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Behar |first1 = Doron M. |last2 = Metspalu |first2 = Mait |last3 = Baran |first3 = Yael |last4 = Kopelman |first4 = Naama M. |last5 = Yunusbayev |first5 = Bayazit |last6 = Gladstein |first6 = Ariella |last7 = Tzur |first7 = Shay |last8 = Sahakyan |first8 = Havhannes |last9 = Bahmanimehr |first9 = Ardeshir |last10 = Yepiskoposyan |first10 = Levon |last11 = Tambets |first11 = Kristiina |last12 = Khusnutdinova |first12 = Elza K. |last13 = Kusniarevich |first13 = Aljona |last14 = Balanovsky |first14 = Oleg |first15 = Elena |last15 = Balanovsky |first16 = Lejla |last16 = Kovacevic |first17 = Damir |last17 = Marjanovic |first18 = Evelin |last18 = Mihailov |first19 = Anastasia |last19 = Kouvatsi |first20 = Costas |last20 = Traintaphyllidis |first21 = Roy J. |last21 = King |first22 = Ornella |last22 = Semino |first23 = Antonio |last23 = Torroni |first24 = Michael F. |last24 = Hammer |first25 = Ene |last25 = Metspalu |first26 = Karl |last26 = Skorecki |first27 = Saharon |last27 = Rosset |first28 = Eran |last28 = Halperin |first29 = Richard |last29 = Villems |first30 = Noah A. |last30 = Rosenberg|year = 2013 |title = No Evidence from Genome-Wide Data of a Khazar Origin for the Ashkenazi Jews|url = http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/humbiol_preprints/41/ |journal = Human Biology Open Access Pre-Prints |publisher = [[Wayne State University]] |issue = 41 |accessdate = 14 October 2014 |quote = Final version at http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/humbiol/vol85/iss6/9/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical genetics===
{{Main|Medical genetics of Jews}}
There are many references to Ashkenazi Jews in the literature of medical and population genetics. Indeed, much awareness of "Ashkenazi Jews" as an ethnic group or category stems from the large number of genetic studies of disease, including many that are well reported in the media, that have been conducted among Jews. Jewish populations have been studied more thoroughly than most other human populations, for a variety of reasons:
* Jewish populations, and particularly the large Ashkenazi Jewish population, are ideal for such research studies, because they exhibit a high degree of [[endogamy]], yet they are sizable.&lt;ref name=JewsasSubjects&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carmeli, Daphna Birenbaum|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics|year=2004|title=Prevalence of Jews as subjects in genetic research: Figures, explanation, and potential implications |volume=130A|issue=1|pages=76–83|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.20291|pmid=15368499}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jewish communities are comparatively well informed about genetics research, and have been supportive of community efforts to study and prevent genetic diseases.&lt;ref name=JewsasSubjects/&gt;

The result is a form of [[ascertainment bias]]. This has sometimes created an impression that Jews are more susceptible to genetic disease than other populations.&lt;ref name=JewsasSubjects/&gt; Healthcare professionals are often taught to consider those of Ashkenazi descent to be at increased risk for colon cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. (2009). The guide to clinical preventive services 2009. AHRQ Publication No. 09-IP006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic counseling]] and [[genetic testing]] are often undertaken by couples where both partners are of Ashkenazi ancestry. Some organizations, most notably [[Dor Yeshorim]], organize screening programs to prevent [[homozygote|homozygosity]] for the [[gene]]s that cause related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;E. L.

A serious '''attack on Richard Nixon's motorcade''' occurred in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], during his 1958 goodwill tour of [[South America]], undertaken while Nixon was [[Vice-President of the United States|Vice President of the United States]]. The attack on Nixon's car was called, at the time, the "most violent attack ever perpetrated on a high American official while on foreign soil". Close to being killed while a couple of his aides were injured in the melee, Nixon ended up unharmed and his entourage managed to reach the U.S. embassy. The incident was possibly orchestrated by the [[Communist Party of Venezuela]], while police and military forces were conspicuously absent to avoid provoking the Communists. U.S. Navy Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]] mobilized fleet and Marine units to the region, compelling the Venezuelan government to provide full protection to Nixon for the remainder of the trip.

The attack was denounced by all major Venezuelan presidential candidates standing in [[Venezuelan general election, 1958|that year's election]], except for the incumbent leader Admiral [[Wolfgang Larrazábal]]. Nixon was generally applauded in American press reports for his calm and adept handling of the incident and was feted with a "hero's welcome" on his return to the United States. His recollections of the attack form one of the "six crises" in his [[Six Crises|eponymous book]]. The attack has been credited with awakening U.S. officials to a growing tide of [[anti-Americanism]] in the western hemisphere, but of also deeply affecting Nixon on a personal level, shaping his perception of Latin America as a region prone to "violence and irrationality".

==Context==
[[Richard Nixon]]'s carefully planned 1958 tour of South America has been described as one of the "most important United States foreign policy events in post-WWII Latin America".&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Jeff|title="They Aren't Friendly, Mr. Vice President"|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2012/0712/comm/cox_nixon.html|website=American Diplomacy|publisher=[[University of North Carolina]]|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was undertaken at a time of confused United States intra-hemispheric relations; the role of Latin American states in the emerging American [[grand strategy]] of [[containment]] was unclear and ill-defined. However, a recent worldwide drop in [[commodity]] prices that badly affected South American economies, coupled with increasing Soviet overtures in the western hemisphere, made [[President of the United States]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]] determine that a tour by a major United States functionary was necessary to demonstrate U.S. commitment to the region.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; Nixon, himself, says he was uninterested in taking the trip.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nixon|first1=Richard|title=Six Crises|date=1962|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|pages=183–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour was to see Nixon visit every independent country in South America except [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]].{{efn|[[Suriname]] and [[Guyana]] were not, at the time, independent.}} Brazil had been omitted from the itinerary as Nixon had visited that nation the previous year. The Chilean leadership, meanwhile, were scheduled to be out-of-the-country during the time period of Nixon's visit. Nixon was accompanied on his trip by his wife, [[Pat Nixon]].&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

==Tour==

===Early stops===
Nixon began his tour in [[Uruguay]], arriving at [[Carrasco International Airport]] at 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on April 28. There, he was greeted by senior Uruguayan officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nixon Begins Goodwill Tour|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/22342944/?terms|accessdate=March 14, 2017|work=The Daily Inter-Lake|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=April 28, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an [[Associated Press]] report at the time, about 40 students protested on the street corner as Nixon's motorcade proceeded into Montevideo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheers and Jeers Get Nixon's Smile|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/10937553/?terms|accessdate=March 14, 2017|work=Terre Haute Star|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=April 29, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Montevideo]], Nixon made an unscheduled appearance at the [[University of the Republic]] and was generally well-received by students. According to Nixon, he decided to make the unannounced stop because he felt that average Uruguayans would be receptive towards him, while scheduled and published visits were likely to attract organized demonstrations. This proved to be the case, and when communists arrived and tried to distribute literature, the students tore up the pamphlets.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

The visit to [[Argentina]] was billed as the major stop of the trip and four days were allotted to the country, instead of the two slated for the other visits. In [[Buenos Aires]], Nixon attended the presidential inauguration of [[Arturo Frondizi]] and spoke to several student and organized labor groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diaz-Bonilla|first1=Eugenio|title=A Long and Winding Road: The Creation of the Inter American Development Bank|date=2011|isbn=1257089994|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vice_President_Richard_Nixon_drinks_yerba_mate_from_a_mate_gourd_at_a_barbeque_luncheon_held_at_the_residence_of_Luis_Batlle_Berres_in_Montevideo,_Uruguay.jpg|thumb|left|The early part of Nixon's tour went relatively smoothly. Here, he drinks [[Mate (beverage)|mate]] at the Montevideo home of former Uruguayan president [[Luis Batlle Berres]].]]
The first serious trouble on the tour materialized in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]. Nixon's scheduled appearance at the [[University of San Marcos]] saw a large crowd of student demonstrators awaiting his arrival. In an event foreshadowing his famous visit to the Lincoln Memorial to meet anti-war protesters some years later, Nixon waded directly into the crowd of demonstrators, attended by only two staff members. Over the next few minutes Nixon spoke with the students, however, a second faction of demonstrators soon began stoning the group, hitting one of Nixon's staff in the mouth and grazing the vice-president's neck. The vice-president then withdrew and a later round-table with student leaders was canceled. Returning to his hotel, Nixon and his staff had to push through demonstrators who had encamped outside, during which Nixon was struck in the face.&lt;ref name="nixonland"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peru Apologizes for Violence on Nixon|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/21969001|accessdate=March 15, 2017|work=Delta Democrat-Gazette|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=May 9, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; Eisenhower cabled Nixon at his next stop, in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message From the President to the Vice President, at Quito|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v05/d45|website=Office of the Historian|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nixon_Colombia.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Nixon, pictured here in [[Bogotá]] in 1958, was well-received during his stop in Colombia.]]
{{quote|Dear Dick: Your courage, patience and calmness in the demonstration directed against you by radical agitators have brought you new respect and admiration in our country. I am certain that the vast majorities of citizens both in Peru and in the United States deplore the incident caused by a few. I note with satisfaction that the Peruvian Government has already expressed to you its regret. Indeed, I feel that every participant in the mob will finally come to feel a sense of guilt and embarrassment because of his failure to show toward a friendly visitor the ordinary measure of courtesy and hospitality. Give my love to Pat and warm regards to yourself.}}

Nixon's final stop before [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]] saw generally receptive crowds. At [[Bolívar Square]] in [[Bogotá]], he laid a wreath at the statue of [[Simón Bolívar]] before a crowd of about 1,000. An Associated Press report noted that there were some hecklers in the audience, but they amounted to "about 80 youths" and observed that "generally ... the Colombian crowds were friendly or enthusiastic".&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Stanford|title=Nixon Shrugs Off Hecklers|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/81843531/|accessdate=March 15, 2017|work=Monroe News-Star|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 12, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===

====Background====
Earlier in 1958, the disliked Venezuelan dictator [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]] had been overthrown in a popular uprising and had gone into exile in the United States. A military junta formed a caretaker government to rule the country until new elections could be held. Admiral [[Wolfgang Larrazábal]], head of the governing junta, had announced his intention to stand in those elections; his candidacy was backed by a coalition of parties, including the [[Venezuelan Communist Party]]. The United States' decision to grant Pérez Jiménez asylum, coupled with the increasing influence of the Communist Party in [[Cold War]]-era Venezuela, combined to create a charged atmosphere leading up to Nixon's arrival. The Caracas municipal council even passed a resolution effectively declaring Nixon ''[[persona non grata]]''.&lt;ref name="hnn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chavez|first1=Manny|title=Just Why Did Nixon Go to Venezuela in 1958 Anyway?|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/159218|accessdate=March 14, 2017|work=History News Network|date=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Nixon's arrival in Caracas, media reported on rumors that an attempt had been planned on the vice-president's life during his visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Warn Guards of Nixon Plot Tip|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1958/05/13/page/5/article/warn-guards-of-nixon-plot-tip|accessdate=March 15, 2017|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=May 13, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CIA station chief]] in Venezuela, meanwhile, urged that this leg of the trip be canceled.&lt;ref name="hnn"/&gt;

In an interview conducted after he retired from government service, Robert Amerson, then-press attache to the United States embassy in Venezuela, claims that the demonstrators who disrupted the Venezuela stop on the tour "had been bused down by the professional agitators and organizers" affiliated with the [[Communist Party of Venezuela]].{{efn|Amerson would later write a letter to the ''New York Times'' in which he questioned if "Caracas dramatized to him that since local conditions primarily caused anti-American sentiment, international Communism might not really be monolithic. This may have influenced his Presidential decisions to deal directly with Communist leaders in China and the Soviet Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amerson|first1=Robert|title=Even Now, Nixon Stirs Up Friend and Foe Alike; Tempered by Caracas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/opinion/l-even-now-nixon-stirs-up-friend-and-foe-alike-tempered-by-caracas-035840.html|accessdate=March 15, 2017|work=[[New York Times]]|date=May 8, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}&lt;ref name="adst"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Day Venezuelans Attacked Nixon|url=http://adst.org/2013/05/the-day-venezuelans-attacked-nixon/|website=Foreign Affairs Oral History Project|publisher=[[Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training]]|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was one echoed in a report issued by William P. Snow, acting [[Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs]], who wrote that "the pattern of organization and of slogans in all cases points to Communist inspiration and direction, as do certain of the intelligence reports".&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; Nixon, himself, also blamed Communist instigation.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; A [[Universal Newsreel]] at the time characterized it as "another of the well-planned campaigns of harassment" and a "communist-sparked onslaught".&lt;ref name="universal"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nixon Ordeal|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI6P_5cgbGQ|accessdate=March 14, 2017|work=[[Universal Newsreel]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlos Rangel]] has indicated the "Nixon carnival" was organized by the Venezuelan Communist Party as a way of demonstrating that it had the ability to "dominate the streets, that the Caracas masses were ready to be mobilized".&lt;ref name="carlos"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangel|first1=Carlos|title=The Latin Americans|date=1977|publisher=Transaction|isbn=141283757X|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tnXMDKTlxiAC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arrival====
Nixon arrived, via air, in Caracas on May 13, 1958. According to a U.S. Secret Service report of the incident, a crowd of demonstrators at the airport "purposely disrupted ... [the] welcoming ceremony by shouting, blowing whistles, waving derogatory placards, throwing stones, and showering the Nixons with human spittle and chewing tobacco".&lt;ref name="pol"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glass|first1=Andrew|title=Vice President Nixon's motorcade attacked in Venezuela, May 13, 1958|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/vice-president-nixons-motorcade-attacked-in-venezuela-may-13-1958-106584|accessdate=March 13, 2017|work=[[Politico]]|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Earl Mazo]] wrote that "Venezuelan troops and police seemed to evaporate. The vice-president and the whole official party literally had to fight their way to cars behind a thin but sturdy phalanx of U.S. Secret Service agents".&lt;ref name="earl"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mazo|first1=Earl|title=Screeching Mob Hurls Rocks at Nixon|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/51565652|accessdate=March 16, 2017|work=San Bernardino County Sun|date=May 14, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:WolfangLarraz%C3%A1bal.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral Wolfgang Larrazábal, leader of the ruling junta, was reportedly concerned heavy-handed policing would alienate his base.]]
The original itinerary had Nixon moving from the airport to the [[National Pantheon of Venezuela]] where he was to lay a wreath at the tomb of [[Simón Bolívar]]. However, a United States naval attache sent ahead with the wreath reported a crowd that had assembled at the Pantheon had attacked him and torn up the wreath. At this point it was decided to proceed directly to the U.S. embassy.&lt;ref name="adst"/&gt;

====Attack====
For the first time on the South America tour, the Nixons traveled in closed-top cars, as opposed to [[convertible]]s, a decision later credited with saving their lives.&lt;ref name="universal"/&gt;

As the Nixons traveled by motorcade through Caracas, the vehicle carrying the Vice-President was slowed to a crawl by heavy traffic.{{efn|According to [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], citing secondhand information, Nixon had personally insisted the press truck drive ahead of his vehicle. The larger vehicle could only make 25 miles per hour which slowed the entire motorcade to the point the mob was able to stop it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearson|first1=Drew|title=Washington Merry-Go-Round: The Drew Pearson Diaries, 1960–1969|date=2015|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=1612347134|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A crowd used the stoppage to throng Nixon's vehicle, stoning it and banging the windows with their fists.&lt;ref name="pol"/&gt; Nixon was protected by twelve United States Secret Service agents, some of whom were injured in the melee.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; According to the Secret Service, Venezuelan police declined to intervene to clear the crowd. When the mob began rocking the car back and forth in an attempt to overturn it, U.S. Secret Service agents, believing the vice-president's life was in jeopardy, drew their firearms and prepared to begin shooting into the crowd. In an act described as "the kind of presence of mind for which battlefield commanders win medals", Nixon ordered Secret Service agent-in-charge Jack Sherwood to hold fire and shoot only on his orders; no shots were ultimately fired.&lt;ref name="nixon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aitken|first1=Jonathan|title=Nixon: A Life|date=2015|publisher=Regnery Publishing|isbn=1621574423|pages=296–297|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIQcCgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nixonland"/&gt;

Nixon would later recount that Venezuelan Foreign Minister Óscar García Velutini, who was traveling with him, was "close to hysterics" and kept repeating "this is terrible, this is terrible". According to Nixon, Velutini explained the police inaction was because the communists "helped us overthrow Pérez Jiménez and we are trying to find a way to work with them".&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Nixon's longtime secretary, [[Rose Mary Woods]], was injured by flying glass when the windows in the follow car in which she was riding were smashed and [[Vernon Walters]], then a mid-ranking U.S. Army officer serving as Nixon's translator, would end up with a "mouthful of glass".&lt;ref name="nixon"/&gt; Velutini was also hit by shards of the limousine's supposedly "shatter-proof" glass.&lt;ref name="nixonland"/&gt;
[[File:An_automobile_that_has_sustained_damage_following_a_mob_attack_in_Caracas,_Venezuela,_targeting_Vice_President_Richard_Nixon._Close-up_of_shattered_windows.jpg|thumb|left|Nixon's car, even though it was equipped with shatter-proof glass, was unable to withstand the pummeling it received from the crowd. This photo of one of the motorcade vehicles may have been taken on the grounds of the U.S. embassy after the attack.]]
Two different accounts explain how Nixon's car was ultimately able to escape the mob and continue to the embassy. According to one version of events, the U.S. press corps' [[flatbed truck]], accompanying the motorcade, was used to clear a path through the crowd.&lt;ref name="pol"/&gt; In Nixon's remembrance of the incident, [[Associated Press]] photographer Hank Griffin at one point had to use his camera to beat back a protester who tried to mount the truck.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; According to a second account, soldiers of the [[Venezuelan Army]] arrived and cleared the traffic, thereafter moving the mob back at [[bayonet]]-point to allow Nixon's car to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Anthony|title=The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of Richard Nixon|date=2001|publisher=Penguin|isbn=1101199482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Embassy====
Shortly after the Nixons arrived at the embassy, the Venezuelan army surrounded and fortified the chancellery, reinforcing the small U.S. Marine guard force. Their assistance had earlier been requested by the U.S. ambassador.&lt;ref name="hnn"/&gt; That afternoon, members of the ruling junta arrived at the embassy and lunched with Nixon. The next morning, representatives of Venezuela's major labor unions came to the embassy and requested an audience with Nixon, which was granted. The union leaders apologized for events of the preceding day and disclaimed involvement, though, [[United States Air Force]] officer Manuel Chavez{{efn|Chavez was a relative of Senator [[Dennis Chávez]].&lt;ref name="hnn"/&gt;}} – at the time attached to the embassy – wrote in 2015 that "they probably were the instigators or at least encouraged the actions".&lt;ref name="hnn"/&gt;

====U.S. mobilization====
Upon learning of the incident, [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]] ordered the airlift of elements of the [[2nd Marine Division]] and the [[101st Airborne Division]] to staging areas in [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Guantánamo Bay]], [[Cuba]]. The aircraft carrier ''[[USS Tarawa (CV-40)|USS Tarawa]]'', along with eight destroyers and two [[amphibious assault ship]]s, were ordered to put to sea towards Venezuela.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="courier"/&gt; The U.S. mobilization was code-named "Operation [[Poor Richard's Almanack|Poor Richard]]".&lt;ref name="nixonland"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perlstein|first1=Rick|authorlink=Rick Perlstein|title=Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America|date=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=1451606265|pages=48–49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dM_enWzoghoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:USS_Tarawa_(CVA-40)_underway_at_sea_on_18_December_1952.jpg|thumb|right|A fleet of 12 ships centered on ''USS Tarawa'', pictured here in 1952, was ordered to Venezuela once news of the attack on Nixon reached Washington.]]
According to U.S. officials at the time, the forces mobilized were being readied to enter Venezuela to "cooperate with the Venezuelan government", though later accounts suggest President Eisenhower was preparing to "invade Venezuela" should Nixon suffer further indignity.&lt;ref name="carlos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nixon attacked by angry Venezuelans|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nixon-attacked-by-angry-venezuelans|website=History|publisher=[[History Channel]]|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="courier"&gt;{{cite news|title=Troops Fly to Aid Nixon|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/31918792/?terms|accessdate=March 13, 2017|work=Press-Courier|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=May 14, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privately, Eisenhower was reportedly furious at the attack on Nixon and, at one point, told his staff "I am about ready to go put my uniform on".&lt;ref name="max"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Max|title=Rethinking Anti-Americanism|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521683424|pages=156–159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6SlfhN4iqsC|ref=max}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alba"/&gt;

Nixon was shocked after learning about the mobilization and wondered why they were not consulted, but later found out that communications between Caracas and Washington had been cut for a critical period immediately after the riot that afternoon.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

In response to the movement of American military forces into the region, Admiral Larrazábal pledged the Nixon party would be "protected fully" thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Troops Arrive to Help Nixon|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/54975569/?terms=|accessdate=March 14, 2017|work=Ironwood Daily Globe|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 13, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to the United States===
Additional activities were canceled, and Nixon departed Caracas the next morning, seven hours early. His motorcade to the airport was protected by a major deployment of Venezuelan Army infantry and armored forces in the capital.&lt;ref name="universal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hnn"/&gt; Nixon described having taken the same route as before, whose streets were empty and heavy patrolled after the whole area had been [[Tear gas|tear-gassed]].&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

====American reaction====
Eisenhower ordered that Nixon should receive a "hero's welcome" on his return; all U.S. government employees in Washington, D.C. were given the day off work to turn-out for the arrival of the vice-president. Nixon deplaned before "a cheering crowd of 10,000" that included the congressional leadership and ambassadors from most Latin American countries. Eisenhower personally greeted Nixon at the airport and the two then traveled to the White House along a route lined by 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="universal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lungren|first1=John|title=Healing Richard Nixon: A Doctor's Memoir|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813129095|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Nixon Welcome Today|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1958/05/15/page/1/article/quits-caracas-early-goes-to-puerto-rico|accessdate=March 13, 2017|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=May 15, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[LIFE (magazine)|Life]]'' credited Nixon for his "courage" and said "his coolness had been remarkable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caracas: The U.S. Reaction|work=LIFE|date=May 26, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pathé News]], Nixon reflected "calm, rather than concern."&lt;ref name="pathe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tragic Incidents In Venezuela Against Vice President Nixon (1958)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHR1dBTJrRA|website=British Pathé|publisher=[[Pathé News]]|accessdate=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For weeks after the attack, Nixon received standing ovations "wherever he went ... a new high in his life".&lt;ref name="nixonland"/&gt; By contrast, ''[[The New Republic]]'' claimed the attack was a hoax set up to help Nixon's chances in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1960]].&lt;ref name="nixonland"/&gt;

All twelve agents of Nixon's Secret Service detail received the Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service from Eisenhower at Nixon's request.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

====Venezuelan reaction====
In Venezuela, all major presidential candidates standing in the [[Venezuelan general election, 1958|1958 general election]] denounced the attack except for the incumbent president, Admiral Larrazábal. After Nixon's departure, Larrazábal said that he would have joined the protests if he were a student. Although receiving strong backing by the communists, Larrazábal lost the election to the center-left candidate [[Rómulo Betancourt]] who ultimately banned the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Drinot, Paulo|title=Che’s Travels: The Making of a Revolutionary in 1950s Latin America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGCqI0WbCscC&amp;pg=PT166 |year=2010 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0-8223-9180-5 |pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1961 visit of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] to Venezuela, anti-American violence also broke out, however, a repeat of the 1958 attack was avoided. President Betancourt pre-deployed significant Venezuelan military forces into Caracas in advance of Kennedy's arrival and ordered the preventative arrest of suspected ringleaders. All ten miles of the highway Kennedy was scheduled to travel from the airport, the same highway traveled by Nixon, were closed effective the day before Kennedy's arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewell, Judith|title=Venezuela and the United States: From Monroe's Hemisphere to Petroleum's Empire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_Bn5HBkJyoC&amp;pg=PA214 |year=1996 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=978-0-8203-1782-3 |pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 editorial on the attack published by the [[Bolivarian]] radio station Alba Ciudad disputed the characterization of the incident, explaining that, "no one forced him [Nixon] to stay on Venezuelan soil, no one had him abducted, no one was blocking him or holding him in the country. To the contrary, people asked him to leave!"&lt;ref name="Alba"&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela casi fue invadida en 1958 cuando ocurrió un hecho similar al vivido por Evo Morales|url=http://albaciudad.org/2013/07/venezuela-casi-fue-invadida-en-1958-cuando-ocurrio-un-hecho-similar-al-vivido-por-evo-morales/|accessdate=March 15, 2017|work=Alba Ciudad|date=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Pathé News, at the time, described the assault as "the most violent attack ever perpetrated on a high American official while on foreign soil".&lt;ref name="pathe"/&gt;
[[File:Nixons wave from AFO 1972.jpg|thumb|left|Nixon, pictured here 14 years after the attack, was deeply affected by his experiences in Caracas.]]
Various sources describe the attack as one that nearly led to Nixon's death&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; and, though it is generally agreed he acted with remarkable composure throughout, the incident had a lasting impact on him. Every year on the anniversary of the attack, Nixon would "privately celebrate" with [[Vernon A. Walters|Vernon Walters]].&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Vernon Walters, Back in His World|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/12/16/vernon-walters-back-in-his-world/0b4dab21-5caf-44bd-bc4a-965dcea61c85/|accessdate=March 15, 2017|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=December 16, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon would favor Walters for the rest of his career, eventually appointing him [[Deputy Director of Central Intelligence]].&lt;ref name="wapo"/&gt; On the eve of Walters' retirement from government service, in 1991, Nixon explained his longtime patronage of the general, writing him that "you and I have faced death together and that gives us a special bond".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raymont|first1=Henry|title=Troubled Neighbors: The Story of US-Latin American Relations, from FDR to the Present|date=2005|publisher=Westview|isbn=0813343038|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon's experiences in Venezuela have been attributed to an extreme hardening of his attitude toward Latin America, which he came to "equate with violence and irrationality". Some believe this change of mood foreshadowed  his subsequent support for covert U.S. actions directed in support of dictatorial regimes in the region. In fact, he would later privately list several nations whose populations, he believed, were too immature for democratic government and would be better administered by authoritarian regimes, specifically citing [[France]], [[Italy]], and all of Latin America "except for [[Colombia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Qureshi|first1=Lubna|title=Nixon, Kissinger, and Allende: U.S. Involvement in the 1973 Coup in Chile|date=2009|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0739126555|pages=2–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=alISgQdNY4kC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="max"/&gt;

The incident has been credited with first making American policymakers aware of growing popular resentment to U.S. policies in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McPherson|first1=Alan L.|title=Yankee No!|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674040880|pages=10–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uW5CYPFMQasC}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1958, the [[U.S. National Security Council]] would list "yankeephobia" as a key challenge to U.S. interests in Latin America.&lt;ref name="max"/&gt;

'''Birgi''' is a small town located in the [[Ödemiş]] district of [[İzmir Province|İzmir province]] in [[Turkey]].  Its current name is a distortion of its medieval Greek name, '''Pyrgion''' (Greek: Πυργίον, meaning "Little Tower").

==History==
In [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], the town was known as '''Dios Hieron''' ({{lang-el|Διός Ἱερόν}}, "Sanctuary of [[Zeus]]").&lt;ref name="DOAKS"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = John W. | editor1-last=Nesbitt | editor2-first = Nicolas | editor2-last=Oikonomides | editor2-link=Nicolas Oikonomides | title=Catalogue of Byzantine Seals at Dumbarton Oaks and in the Fogg Museum of Art, Volume 3: West, Northwest, and Central Asia Minor and the Orient | publisher = Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection | year = 1996 | isbn=0-88402-250-1 | page = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dios Hieron was an ancient [[polis|Greek city]] of [[Ionia]]. It belonged to the [[Delian League]] as is mentioned in records of tributes to [[Classical Athens|Athens]] between 454/3 and 416/5 B.C. Moreover, an Athenian decree of 427/6 B.C. indicates that at that time venerated [[Hieron Colophon]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien, Oriens Christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus , [[Paris]] 1740, Volume I, coll.  723-724.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Culerrier, Les Évêchés suffragants of Éphèse aux 5th to 13th siècles , in Revue des études byzantines, Vol45, 1987, p.155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Janin, v. Dioshiéron, in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques , vol.  XIV, Paris 1960, coll.  514-515.&lt;/ref&gt; The city is mentioned by [[Thucydides]] after [[Chios]] revolted against the Athenians,  while [[Pliny the Elder]] says Dioshieronitans came to [[Ephesus]] to settle their legal issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]] V, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The city became part of the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman province]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] with the annexation of the [[Kingdom of Pergamon]].

It was renamed to ''Christoupolis'' ({{lang-el|Χριστούπολις}}) in the 7th century and was known as ''Pyrgion'' ({{lang-el|Πυργίον}}) from the 12th century on.&lt;ref name="DOAKS"/&gt; Pyrgion fell to the Turks in 1307, and became the capital of the [[Anatolian beyliks|beylik]] of [[Aydinids|Aydin]].&lt;ref name="DOAKS"/&gt; 

[[Ibn Battuta]] visited the city and attended a lecture by the eminent professor Muhyi al-Din.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=107-108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was subsequently  incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1390. Birgi is well known for its classic [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman architecture]] and has been listed as a World Cultural Heritage by [[ÇEKÜL]][http://www.cekulvakfi.org.tr/we-exist-through-nature-and-culture (Protection and Promotion of the Environment and Cultural Heritage)] since 1994.

==Bishopric==
The [[Roman Empire|Roman Era]]  city had an ancient [[Christian]] [[Bishopric]] attested as an [[episcopal see]] from at least 451, It was a [[suffragan]] of [[See of Ephesus|Ephesus]], which it remained under until the late [[12th century]] when it became a separate [[metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis]].&lt;ref name="DOAKS"/&gt;

There are four known [[bishop]]s of this [[diocese]] from antiquity.  
*Stephen took part in the [[Council of Ephesus]] of 431 
*Eustorgios was not present at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) and his metropolitan, Stephen of Ephesus, signed on his behalf  
*Zoetus was among the fathers of the [[Third Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] of 680 and the [[Council in Trullo]] of 692
*Stephen of Pyrgion participated at the two Councils of Constantinople in [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)|869–870]] and  [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|879–880]] who dealt with the issue of Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople]]

Today Dioshieron survives as [[titular bishop]]ric in the [[Roman Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pius Bonifacius Gams]], Series Episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae , Leipzig 1931, p.  444.&lt;/ref&gt;  so far the see has never been assigned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d2d49.html Dioshieron] at Catholichierachy.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t0642.htm Dioshieron] at GCatholic.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Classical acting''' is a type of acting that is based on the theories and systems of select classical actors including [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Michel Saint-Denis]], including the expression of the body, voice, imagination, personalizing, improvisation, external stimuli, and script analysis.

==History==
The origin of classical acting stems from an acting system created by Russian actor and director [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] who rose to prominence in the late 1800s and early 1900s. His system was that of both script analysis and personal exploration to find "the truth" of a part—or rather what would be truthful to the actor portraying the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Constantin Stanislavsky|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Constantin_Stanislavsky.aspx|year=2004|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise system was based on having an expressive and responsive body to relay detailed and nuanced character portrayals, as well as addressing the creation of an inner life.&lt;ref name="merlin"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Actor’s Work is finally done:A response to the new Jean Benedetti translation of Stanislavski’s An Actor’s Work|author=Bella Merlin|url=http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/stanislavski/downloads/bella-article.pdf|date=January 2008|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanislavski's theories were published in the translated 1936 book ''[[An Actor Prepares]]''. The training included:&lt;ref name="system"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Sonia|title=The Stanislavski System: The Professional Training of an Actor|publisher=Viking Penguin Inc.|year=1960|edition=Second Edition Revised|location=USA|isbn=0140466606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* An emphasis on physical acting, or physical actions
* Imagination as a way to find character and relate to other actors
* The super-objective and "through line of actions" in analyzing the script, including the main essence
* Exploring subtext
* Personalizing through emotional memory— real life and imagined experiences

Another influential theorist of classical acting in the early-to mid-1900s was [[Michel Saint-Denis]], a French actor and theater director who founded The London Theatre Studio and dedicated much of his career to [[experimental theatre]]. He incorporated many of Stanislavski's techniques into his teaching, as well as improvisation and sense memory, seeking a balance between external and internal techniques. Actors [[Alec Guinness]], [[Jessica Tandy]], and [[Laurence Olivier]] were some of his first students. Later on, he developed a training model that was incorporated by many university drama programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michelsaintdenis.net/msd/content/view/14/43/lang,en/|title=The Rediscovery of Michel Saint-Denis, a biography|last=Baldwin|first=Jane|year=2007|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Classical acting today is available for study in universities, drama conservatories, and acting studios across the world. Schools that are attached to or affiliated with a professional classical theatre company give students exposure and opportunity beyond simply the education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://destinycasting.wordpress.com/2012/06/22/getting-started-as-an-actor-part-2/|title=Getting Started as an Actor Part 2|date=22 June 2012|last=Lilly|first=Destiny|publisher=Casting in the City|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of schools or studios with classical acting programs include:

* [[University of London]]'s Drama Conservatoire: This Masters of Acting program draws on theories of Michel Saint-Denis with training of the body, voice, and imagination. There is an emphasis on re-interpretation and re-imagining, with equal parts of art and craft in the education. Classical texts of Greek tragedy and Shakespeare are utilized, as well as modern plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssd.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/masters/ma-acting/ma-acting-classical|title=MA Acting Classical program|publisher=University of London|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CNSAD]] The Conservatoire national supérieur d'art dramatique (English: French National Academy of Dramatic Arts): France's national drama academy located in Paris. It is a higher education institution run by the French Ministry of Culture and, with an acceptance rate of two to three percent and an average graduating class of thirty students, widely considered the most selective acting conservatory in France, is consistently regarded as a top world-class performing arts institute renowned for its excellence in theatre education.
* The [[Juilliard School]] Drama Division in New York: The School has both a B.F.A. and M.F.A. program that emphasizes intuition and spontaneity, as well as discipline, technique, and intellectual development. There is both vocal and physical training, with script and word analysis, style work, and risk taking with imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juilliard.edu/degrees-programs/drama/index.php|title=Juilliard Drama program|publisher=Juilliard School|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Montreal’s [[National Theatre School of Canada]]: This three-year conservatory training program focuses on learning the craft and art of acting through the contemporary theatre, applying techniques of voice, singing, and movement. The School ascribes to the philosophies of Michel Saint-Denis, which includes exploration, writing, studio presentations, imagination, improvisation, "the mask", and audition preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent-nts.ca/en/programs/acting/|title=Acting program|publisher=National Theatre School of Canada|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Berg Studios]] in Los Angeles: The Studios offer a series of classes at various levels to explore classical acting technique and imagination, including developing of a repeatable acting system, script analysis, physical movement, self-discovery through imagination, and illuminating the dialogue through subtext.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebergstudios.com/technique.html|title=Technique|last=Berger-Sobeck|first=Gregory|publisher=The Berg Studios|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrew Wood Acting Studio]] in Los Angeles: Andrew Wood Acting Studio offers classes in which students learn an approach to acting taught at the Yale School of Drama. The approach emphasiszes visceral activation of the actor through deep examination of circumstances and personalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewwoodla.com|title=Technique|last=Wood|first=Andrew|publisher=Andrew Wood Acting Studios|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yale School of Drama]] in New Haven, Connecticut: In its M.F.A. program, a strong imagination is encouraged and developed, along with physical and vocal work. Actors are also given extensive production work opportunities, working with director, dramaturgs, and playwrights to create theatre pieces and learn from the collaborative process. Using the body as a source of inspiration and expression of work is a focus of the first year training. Later, text analysis, voice, and speech work are integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drama.yale.edu/admissions/acting.html|title=Acting program|publisher=Yale School of Drama|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Bristol Old Vic Theatre School]] in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom: Opened in 1946 by [[Laurence Olivier]], this South West England school offers a highly selective B.A. Honors of Professional Acting conservatory program. The first year focuses on voice and body, moving onto public productions, and then to preparation for a professional career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldvic.ac.uk/three-year-professional-acting-ba-hons-ukeu.html|title=Three year Professional Acting (BA Hons) (UK/EU)|publisher=Bristol Old Vic Theatre School|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school also provides short courses for the general public who has had some experience or training in acting and wants to broaden skills; the classical acting classes include learning opportunities in voice, movement, verse speaking, improvisation, and stagecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldvic.ac.uk/short-courses.html|title=Short Acting Courses|publisher=Bristol Old Vic Theatre School|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Comedy Central Roasts''''' are a series of [[celebrity]] [[roast (comedy)|roast]] [[television special|specials]] that air on the American television channel [[Comedy Central]]. The first official ''Comedy Central Roast'' premiered on August 10, 2003. 

On average one to two roasts air every year. There are eight to ten people invited who roast each other before finally roasting the title subject of each show. As of 2018, sixteen roasts have aired. Targets of roasts have included actors and comedians.

Since 2010, Comedy Central affiliates outside the United States have occasionally produced their own roasts; eight such roasts have been produced in total.

==History==
Between 1998 and 2002, the American television channel [[Comedy Central]] produced and televised the annual roasts of the [[New York Friars Club]], which have been conducted since 1950.

*1998 – [[Drew Carey]], roastmaster [[Ryan Stiles]]
*1999 – [[Jerry Stiller]], roastmaster [[Jason Alexander]]
*2000 – [[Rob Reiner]], roastmaster [[Michael McKean]]
*2001 – [[Hugh Hefner]], roastmaster [[Jimmy Kimmel]]
*2002 – [[Chevy Chase]], roastmaster [[Paul Shaffer]]
After the original five-year agreement expired, the network began producing its own roasts in the same spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/press/bios/index.jhtml?pg=milestones |title=Jack Carter, Smothers Brothers at Rip-Roaring Friars Roast |accessdate=August 15, 2007 |first=Frank |last=DiGiacomo |publisher=''[[New York Observer]]'' |date=October 12, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120202334/http://www.comedycentral.com/press/bios/index.jhtml?pg=milestones |archivedate=January 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, featuring roastee [[Denis Leary]] (and produced by Leary's production company, Apostle), aired on August 10, 2003, and was the most watched program in the channel's history, excluding episodes of ''[[South Park]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/press/bios/index.jhtml?pg=milestones |title=Comedy Central Milestones |work= |publisher=Comedycentral.com |date= |accessdate=August 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120540/http://www.comedycentral.com/press/bios/index.jhtml?pg=milestones |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some roastees have stated that certain topics are off limits. [[Pamela Anderson]], for example, prohibited jokes about her [[Hepatitis C]] infection. [[Joan Rivers]] disallowed jokes about her daughter [[Melissa Rivers|Melissa]], [[William Shatner]] asked that the death of his wife not be mentioned, and [[Donald Trump]] prohibited jokes about him not being as wealthy as he claims he is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/08/donald-trump-roast-off-limits-joke.html|title=This Joke Was Off-limits at Donald Trump's Comedy Central Roast|date=3 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like [[David Hasselhoff]], have imposed no limits on the topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/08/lisa_lampanelli_on_last_nights.html |title=Lisa Lampanelli on Last Night's David Hasselhoff Roast: 'I Only Make Fun of People That I Like'|newspaper=[[New York Magazine]]|date=August 16, 2010|author= Rosenblum, Emma|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Charlie Sheen]] initially agreed to no restrictions on his roast, he later said during an interview with [[Jay Leno]] that he requested jokes about his mother be edited out of the broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;Goodacre, Kate (September 16, 2011). [http://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/charlie-sheen/news/a340694/charlie-sheen-asked-for-roast-joke-about-mother-to-be-cut/ "Charlie Sheen 'asked for roast joke about mother to be cut'"]. [[Digital Spy]].&lt;/ref&gt;

During Charlie Sheen's roast, [[Steve-O]] made the joke "The last time this many nobodies were at a roast, at least Great White was playing". This was a reference to [[The Station nightclub fire]] in [[West Warwick, Rhode Island]] that killed 100 people on February 20, 2003. It was removed from broadcast on Steve-O's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/20/charlie-sheen-roast-jokes_n_972334.html|title=Charlie Sheen Roast: The Jokes You Didn't Hear|publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|date=September 20, 2011|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Denis Leary's roast, the comedian [[Lenny Clarke]], a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from [[Bill Hicks]] with the message, "Wish I had gotten these to you sooner." This joke was cut from the final broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Ziano III | first=Nick A. | title=Roasting a comic, they turn up the flames, gently | work=Boston Globe | url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030811054820/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently%2B.shtml | archivedate=August 11, 2003 | date=August 10, 2003 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Roseanne Barr]]'s roast, [[Jeff Ross]] compared fellow roaster [[Seth Green]] to [[James Holmes (mass murderer)|James Holmes]], the mass murderer responsible for the [[2012 Aurora shooting]]. The joke was also removed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/jeff-ross-aurora-massacre-joke-cut-from-roseanne-roast-20120806 "Jeff Ross' Aurora Massacre Joke Cut From Roseanne Roast"].

Dennis Rodman was amongst the crowd on the stage. This roast featured a large amount of jokes and satire regarding sex directed from roasters toward fellow roasters, complete with [[Andy Dick]] appearing as Pamela's [[plastic surgeon]] and [[groping]] her breasts as part of his skit. Many of the jokes were also directed at Courtney Love for appearing to be [[inebriated]] (but claiming to have been [[sobriety|sober]] for a year), Bea Arthur's masculinity, Andy Dick's ambiguous sexuality and Lisa Lampanelli's full figured body as well as her attraction towards [[black people]].

In an appearance on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', [[Ellen DeGeneres]] revealed that she was approached by Braun, Bieber's manager, to participate in the roast, but refused because she did not want to be mean to Bieber.

Originally taped on August 27, 2016. The Roast was simulcast on [[Spike (TV network)|Spike]] and [[TV Land]]. [[Bo Derek]] was originally announced as a roaster, but was replaced by Jewel due to a scheduling conflict. According to [[Tony Hinchcliffe]], who was assigned by Comedy Central to write the first draft of [[Ann Coulter]]'s set, Coulter was unaware of the nature of roasts when she agreed to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/09/ann-coulter-was-at-the-roast-of-rob-lowe-because-she-didnt-know-what-a-roast-was/|title=Ann Coulter Was At 'The Roast Of Rob Lowe' Because She Didn't Know What A Roast Was - SPIN|date=6 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the other roasters harshly targeted Coulter. She was criticised for her strong conservative political views, called a "[[cunt]]" by Davidson, compared to members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and even likened to [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/09/06/the-ann-coulter-jokes-at-the-rob-lowe-roast-they-really-were-that-brutal/|title=The Ann Coulter jokes at the Rob Lowe roast?

Coulter claims that her set "killed" live and that her apparent bombing in the aired version of the roast was the result of unflattering editing. Ross refuted Coulter's claim, stating "We edited it to make her look as best we could".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themuse.jezebel.com/roastmaster-jeff-ross-the-roast-was-edited-to-make-ann-1786325303|title=Roastmaster Jeff Ross: The Roast Was Edited To Make Ann Coulter Look as Best We Could|first=Rich|last=Juzwiak|publisher=The Muse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her set centered around a plug for her book ''[[In Trump We Trust]]''.

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1977''' was the fourth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  It was held in [[London]], the [[United Kingdom]], between 8 June 1977 and 15 June 1977, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[James Callaghan]]. President [[Idi Amin]] of Uganda did not attend, and on the eve of the meeting President James Mancham of the Seychelles was overthrown and the country was not represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ingram|first=Derek|author2=Andrew Walker|title=Commonwealth Conference 1977|journal=The Round Table|date=July 1977|issue=267|pages=215–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues discussed at the conference included the situation in Southern Africa, relations between rich and poorer nations, Cyprus, Belize, Uganda, and the issue of sporting contacts with South Africa. The [[Gleneagles Agreement]] on sporting contacts was reached at the meeting's retreat, in [[Gleneagles, Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ingram|first=Derek|author2=Andrew Walker|title=Commonwealth Conference 1977|journal=The Round Table|date=July 1977|issue=267|pages=215–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[double standard]] principle can be applied to one’s age among many other distinctions. This phenomenon is called "double standard of aging" and is most prevalent towards females in the 35-55 age range.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis W. Berman, Barbara A. O'Nan and Wayne Floyd, The double standard of aging and the social situation: Judgments of attractiveness of the middle-aged woman, SEX ROLES Volume 7, Number 2, 87-96&lt;/ref&gt; This is a complicated process that takes into consideration the gender of the observer and the observed as well as the social context of the situation. When judging a person with nobody around both males and females will judge differently from when judging that same person in a group setting. The physical changes that women undergo through the process of aging affects how they are perceived more strongly than the changes that men experience.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Harris, Growing Old Gracefully: Age Concealment and Gender, Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences, Volume 49, Number 4, pages 149-158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical support==
{{See also|Age disparity in sexual relationships}}
As illustrated in a Berman, O'Nan and Floyd study, a female is likely to be judged higher in a private social setting by both males and females than she would in a group social setting. Once the social setting became a group, the women were rated consistently lower, in terms of attractiveness, than the middle aged men and lower than they were in a private setting. In a separate study conducted by Deutisch, Zalenski and Clark,&lt;ref&gt;Francine M. Deuisch, Carla M. Zalenski, Mary E. Clark, Is There a Double Standard of Aging, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, Volume 16, Issue 9, pages 771–785, December 1986&lt;/ref&gt; a double standard of aging was evidenced in all represented age groups. It was determined that both males and females were judged lower in attractiveness as they aged; however, the difference in ratings of attractiveness due to age was much greater for women than for men. This study also found a difference in judgement in terms of masculinity and femininity. For men as they aged their attractiveness was judged as decreasing slightly and when judged based on masculinity there was no change. The women in the other hand were judged far less attractive with age as well as being less feminine.

The '''''Ecce Homo''''' ('''Behold the Man''') in the Sanctuary of Mercy church in [[Borja, Zaragoza|Borja]], Spain, is a [[fresco]] painted circa 1930 by the Spanish painter [[Elías García Martínez]] depicting [[Jesus]] [[Crown of thorns|crowned with thorns]]. Both the subject and style are typical of traditional [[Catholic art]].&lt;ref name=CentroBorjanos&gt;[http://cesbor.blogspot.com.es/2012/08/un-hecho-incalificable.html "Un hecho incalificable"] (in Spanish).

The artist, a professor at the School of Art of Zaragoza, gave the painting to the village where he used to spend his holidays, painting it directly on the wall of the church in about 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/disfigured-spanish-fresco-hit-artist-town-151848237.html|title=Disfigured Spanish Fresco Is Hit for Artist, Town|date=13 August 2013|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albarium Conservación y Restauración.

==Failed restoration attempt and internet phenomenon==
[[File:Attempted restoration of Ecce Homo.jpg|thumb|180px|Cecilia Giménez's attempted restoration of the fresco]]

The authorities in Borja said they had suspected vandalism at first, but then determined that the alterations had been made by an elderly parishioner, Doña Cecilia Giménez, who was in her 80s. She said on Spanish national television that she had started to restore the fresco, because she was upset that parts of it had flaked off due to moisture on the church's walls. Giménez defended herself, saying she could not understand the uproar because she had worked in broad daylight and had tried to salvage the fresco with the approval of the local clergyman. "The priest knew it," she told Spanish television. "I've never tried to do anything hidden."&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;

News of the disfigured painting spread around the globe in August 2012 on mainstream and social media, which promptly led to the status of an [[List of Internet phenomena|internet phenomenon]]. BBC Europe correspondent [[Christian Fraser]] said that the result resembled a "crayon sketch of a very hairy monkey in an ill-fitting tunic".&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The restored version has been jokingly dubbed ''"Ecce Mono"'' ('Behold the Monkey,' ''ecce'' is Latin, whereas ''mono'' is Spanish for 'monkey'; in Latin, it is ''simius'') in an "online rush of global hilarity",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |department=Editorial |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=24 August 2012 |title=Ecce mono |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/269a80c4-edec-11e1-8d72-00144feab49a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Elderly woman destroys 19th century fresco in do-it-herself restoration attempt |date=27 August 2012 |author=Victoria Cavaliere |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/elderly-woman-destroys-19th-century-fresco-do-it-herself-restoration-attempt-article-1.1142772 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=De Ecce Homo... |work=[[El Heraldo (Tegucigalpa)|El Heraldo]] |date=23 August 2012 |quote=Malestar e hilaridad general por destrozo que anciana 'restauradora' ocasionó a pintura.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compared to the plot of the film ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/23/church-masterpiece-restored-as-mr-bean-would-do-it |title=Church masterpiece 'restored' as Mr. Bean would do it |publisher=CNN |date= 23 August 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the negative attention, the priest of the church, Father Florencio Garces, thought the painting should be covered up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=David Randall |author2=Megan Tatum |title=Botched art is an online sensation |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-33520671.html |location=London, England |publisher=''The Independent on Sunday'' (via HighBeam Research) |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic significance==
[[Tongue-in-cheek]] critiques have interpreted the piece as a multifaceted comment on both [[sacred]] and [[Secularity|secular]] themes. A ''[[Forbes]]'' commentator suggested that the "inept restoration" represented "one woman's vision of her savior, uncompromised by schooling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=[...] the updated monkey-like Christ has a freakish new power all its own, and may be its own kind of metaphor for modern man. |title=Spanish Octogenarian's Disastrous Unauthorized Art Restoration Yields Surprisingly Avant-Garde Results |author=Alexander Forbes |work=Art+Auction |date=23 August 2012 |url=http://artinfo.com/news/story/821028/spanish-octogenarians-disastrous-unauthorized-art-restoration-yields-surprisingly-avant-garde-results |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | quote= Works such as the Giménez Jesus are as vital for believers – and as insightful for the rest of us – as traditional masterpieces, albeit for different reasons... We gain access to one woman's vision of her savior, uncompromised by schooling. Her painting documents a live relationship.

An organizer commented that "Cecilia has created a pop icon".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Coyle, Barcelona (7 September 2012).

Uno de sus responsables, Pablo Quijano, explica que la idea es 'fomentar el arte y la creatividad' y 'apoyar a Cecilia Giménez', quién incluso ha padecido ataques de ansiedad desde el suceso.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3662">In [[second language acquisition]], '''error treatment''' refers to the way teachers respond to learners' [[Speech error|linguistic errors]] made in the course of learning a second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Rod|authorlink=Rod Ellis|title=The Study of Second Language Acquisition|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=701}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many error treatment studies seek to address issues like when, how, and by whom such errors should be corrected.

== Types ==
Craig Chaudron (1977) has pointed out four types of treatment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=Chaudron|title=A descriptive model of discourse in the corrective treatment of learners' errors|journal=Language Learning|date=January 1977|volume=27|issue=1|pages=29–46|doi=10.1111/j.1467-1770.1977.tb00290.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 July 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Treatment that creates an autonomous ability in learners to correct themselves on any item
* Treatment that elicits a correct response from the learners
*Any reaction/treatment by a teacher that demands improvement
*Positive or negative reinforcement involving the expression of approval or disapproval

== Terminologies ==
A number of terms are used to discuss the various areas of error treatment, though the differences among these terms are very subtle.

=== Feedback ===
It has characteristics of constructive criticism which may be positive or negative usually from a more informed source.

=== Correction ===
In correcting errors, correction is a post-production exercise and basically deals with the linguistic errors.&lt;ref name=Ellis584&gt;Ellis, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt; Often in the form of feedback, it draws learners' attention to the mistakes they have made and acts as a reminder of the correct form of language.

=== Repair ===
Errors that cause "communication difficulties" are likely to be "repaired" either by speaker or listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allwright |first1=Dick |last2=Bailey |first2=Kathleen M.|title=Focus on the Language classroom |url= |accessdate= |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn=0-521-26909-1 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term repair, which includes correction, is an attempt to identify and correct the communication difficulties.

== Role of teachers and learners ==
The role of teachers and that of learners in correcting errors are of great importance. This tries to answer the question as to ''who'' should indicate and fix the error. The phenomenon is known as "self" and "other". Depending on who indicates and fixes the error either in conversation or in classroom, there can be four possible ways of error correction:&lt;ref&gt;Allwright, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
* self-initiated other-completed
* self-initiated self-completed
* other-initiated self-completed
* other-initiated other-completed
According to Van Lier (1988), in naturally occurring conversation, self-initiated and self-completed repair occurs while in teacher-dominated classroom, other-initiated and other-completed repair can be sought for.

== Description ==
Much of the studies on error treatment have focused on the following three issues:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Michael Byram |encyclopedia=The Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning |publisher= |year=2004 |isbn=9780415332866|page=609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the type of errors that should be treated/corrected
* who performs the correction
* when and how corrections should be made

'''Gujarati''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɡ|ʊ|dʒ|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|t|i}};&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|gu|ગુજરાતી}} {{IAST|''gujarātī''}} {{IPA-gu|ɡudʒəˈɾɑːti|}}) is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] native to the [[India]]n state of [[Gujarat]] and spoken predominantly by the [[Gujarati people]]. Gujarati is part of the greater [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]]. Gujarati is descended from [[Old Gujarati]] (''circa'' 1100–1500&amp;nbsp;AD). In India, it is the official language in the state of [[Gujarat]], as well as an official language in the [[union territory|union territories]] of [[Daman and Diu]] and [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]]. As of 2011, Gujarati is the [[List of languages by number of native speakers in India|6th most widely spoken language in India]] by number of native speakers, spoken by 55.5 million speakers which amounts to about 4.5% of the total Indian population.&lt;ref name=census2011/&gt; It is the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|26th most widely spoken language]] in the world by number of native speakers as of 2007.&lt;ref name="Nationalencyklopedin"&gt;Mikael Parkvall, "Världens 100 största språk 2007" (The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007), in ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]''.

The Gujarati language is more than 700 years old and is spoken by more than 55&amp;nbsp;million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/gujarati-the-language-spoken-by-more-than-55-million-people|quote=Gujarati is at least 700 years old and is spoken by more than 55 million people worldwide.|title=Gujarati: The language spoken by more than 55 million people|date=2017-01-19|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of Gujarat, Gujarati is spoken in many other parts of South Asia by Gujarati migrants, especially in [[Mumbai]] and [[Pakistan]] (mainly in [[Karachi]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1309537|title=Situationer: The future of Gujarati language in Pakistan|first=Rauf|last=Parekh|date=January 20, 2017|publisher=Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gujarati is also widely spoken in many countries outside South Asia by the Gujarati diaspora.

==History==
[[File:Jinnah Gandhi.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]] sharing a [[Laughter|laugh]] in [[Bombay]] in 1944, for ill-fated political talks. These two prime political figures of the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the 20th century were [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]] and native speakers of the Gujarati language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Jinnah, Gujarati was important only as mother tongue. He was neither born nor raised in [[Gujarat]],&lt;ref name="story"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.storyofpakistan.com/person.asp?perid=P009| title=Muhammad Ali Jinnah (1876–1948)| first=Story of Pakistan| last=Timeline: Personalities| accessdate=12 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gujarat did not end up a part of Pakistan, the state he espoused. He went on to advocate for solely [[Urdu]] in his [[Pakistan Movement|politics]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Gandhi, Gujarati served as a medium of literary expression. He helped to inspire a renewal in its literature,&lt;ref name="Dalby"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalby|1998|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1936 he introduced the current spelling convention at the [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad|Gujarati Literary Society]]'s 12th meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mistry|1997|p=654}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Upadesamala2.jpg|thumb|Updeshmala, Manuscript in Jain Prakrit and Old Gujarati on paper, Rupnagar, Rajastan, India, 1666, 76 ff. (−16 ff.), 11x25 cm, single column, (10x22 cm), 4 lines main text, 2–4 lines of interlinear commentary for each text line, in Jain Devanagari book script, filled with red and yellow, 17 paintings in colours mostly of [[Svetambara]] [[Jain]] monks, influenced by the [[Mughal painting|Mughal style]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The text is a Prakrit didactic work of how best to live a proper Jain life, aimed probably at the laity. The Svetambara pontiff, Sri Dharmadasagaî, lived in the mid-6th century. The Old Gujarati prose commentary was written in 1487. The colophon gives the place, date, and the name of the religious leader, Sri Namdalalaji, on whose order the work was transcribed.]]
Gujarati (also sometimes spelled ''Gujerati'', ''Gujarathi'', ''Guzratee'', ''Guujaratee'', "Gujarati", ''Gujrathi'', and ''Gujerathi''&lt;ref name="e18"&gt;{{e18|guj}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mistry2001p274"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mistry|2001|pp=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a modern IA (Indo-Aryan) language [[evolutionary linguistics|evolved]] from [[Sanskrit]]. The traditional practice is to differentiate the IA languages on the basis of three historical stages:&lt;ref name="Mistry2001p274"/&gt;
#Old IA ([[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] and [[Sanskrit|Classical]] Sanskrit)
#Middle IA (various [[Prakrit]]s and [[Apabhramsha]]s)
#New IA (modern languages such as [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Et cetera|etc.]])
Another view postulates successive family tree splits, in which Gujarati is assumed to have separated from other IA languages in four stages:&lt;ref name="M2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mistry|2003|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#IA languages split into Northern, Eastern, and Western divisions based on the innovate characteristics such as [[plosive]]s becoming [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] in the Northern (Skt. ''danta'' "[[tooth]]" &gt; Punj. ''dānd'') and [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] [[sibilant]]s merging with the [[palatal]] in the Eastern (Skt. ''sandhya''  "[[evening]]" &gt; Beng. ''śājh'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mistry|1997|pp=654–655}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Western, into Central and Southern.
#Central, in Gujarati/[[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]], [[Western Hindi]], and Punjabi/Lahanda/Sindhi, on the basis of innovation of [[auxiliary verb]]s and [[postpositions]] in Gujarati/Rajasthani.&lt;ref name="Mistry2001p274"/&gt;
#Gujarati/Rajasthani into Gujarati and Rajasthani through development of such characteristics as auxiliary ''ch''- and the [[Possession (linguistics)|possessive]] [[Marker (linguistics)|marker]] -''n''- during the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mistry|1997|p=655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal changes from Sanskrit are the following:&lt;ref name="M2"/&gt;
*[[Phonology|Phonological]]
**Loss of original [[phoneme|phonemic]] [[Vowel length|length]] for [[vowel]]s
**Change of [[consonant cluster]]s to [[Consonant length|geminate]] and then to single [[consonant]]s (with compensatory vowel length)

Of the approximately 46&amp;nbsp;million speakers of Gujarati in 1997, roughly 45.5&amp;nbsp;million resided in India, 150,000 in Uganda, 50,000 in [[Tanzania]], 50,000 in Kenya and roughly 100,000 in Karachi, Pakistan, excluding several hundreds of thousands of Memonis who do not self-identify as Gujarati, but hail from a region within the state of Gujarat.&lt;ref name="e16"&gt;{{e16|guj}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] community leaders in Pakistan claim that there are 3 million Gujarati speakers in Karachi.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/57104-with-a-handful-of-subberstwo-newspapers-barely-keeping-gujarati-alive-in-karachi|title=With a handful of subbers, two newspapers barely keeping Gujarati alive in Karachi|last=Rehman|first=Zia Ur|date=18 August 2015|work=The News International|quote=In Pakistan, the majority of Gujarati-speaking communities are in Karachi including Dawoodi Bohras, Ismaili Khojas, Memons, Kathiawaris, Katchhis, Parsis (Zoroastrians) and Hindus, said Gul Hasan Kalmati, a researcher who authored "Karachi, Sindh Jee Marvi", a book discussing the city and its indigenous communities.

There is a certain amount of Mauritian population and a large amount of [[Réunion]] Island people who are from Gujarati descent among which some of them still speak Gujarati.

A considerable Gujarati-speaking population exists in [[North America]], most particularly in the [[New York City Metropolitan Area]] and in the [[Greater Toronto Area]], which have over 100,000 speakers and over 75,000 speakers, respectively, but also throughout the major metropolitan areas of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. According to the 2011 census, Gujarati is the seventeenth most spoken language in the Greater Toronto Area, and the fourth most spoken South Asian language after [[Hindi-Urdu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].

The UK has over 200,000 speakers, many of them situated in the [[London]] area, especially in North West London, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], and in [[Leicester]], [[Coventry]], [[Bradford]] and the former mill towns within [[Lancashire]]. A portion of these numbers consists of [[East Africa]]n Gujaratis who, under increasing discrimination and policies of Africanisation in their newly independent resident countries (especially [[Uganda]], where [[Idi Amin]] expelled 50,000 Asians), were left with uncertain futures and [[citizenship]]s. Most, with British [[passport]]s, settled in the UK.&lt;ref name="Dalby"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|1995|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gujarati is offered as a [[GCSE]] subject for students in the UK.

Besides being spoken by the [[Gujarati people]], non-Gujarati residents of and migrants to the state of [[Gujarat]] also count as speakers, among them the [[Kutch]]is (as a [[literary language]]),&lt;ref name="Dalby"/&gt; the [[Parsi people|Parsis]] (adopted as a [[First language|mother tongue]]), and [[Hindu]] [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] [[refugees]] from Pakistan.
A distribution of the geographical area can be found in  '[[Linguistic Survey of India]]' by [[George A. Grierson]].

=== Official status ===
Gujarati is one of the twenty-two [[official language]]s and fourteen [[regional language]]s of India. It is officially recognized in the state of Gujarat, India and the union territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.

Gujarati is recognized and taught as a minority language in the states of [[Rajasthan]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], and [[Tamil Nadu]] and the union territory of [[Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=51st REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER FOR LINGUISTIC MINORITIES IN INDIA|url=http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM51stReport.pdf|website=nclm.nic.in|publisher=[[Ministry of Minority Affairs]]|date=15 July 2015|accessdate=15 February 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216025959/http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM51stReport.pdf|archivedate=16 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{See also|States of India by Gujarati speakers}}

=== Dialects ===
According to British historian and philologist [[William St. Clair Tisdall|William Tisdall]], who was an early scholar of [[Gujarati grammar]], three major varieties of Gujarati exist: a standard 'Hindu' dialect, a '[[Parsi]]' dialect and a '[[Muslim Gujarati|Muslim]]' dialect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/simplifiedgramma00tisdiala A simplified grammar of the Gujarati language by William St. Clair Tisdall (1892)]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Gujarati has undergone contemporary reclassification with respect to the widespread regional differences in vocabulary and phrasing; notwithstanding the number of poorly attested dialects and regional variations in naming.

* Standard Gujarati: this forms something of a standardised variant of Gujarati across news, education and government. It is also spoken in pockets of Maharashtra. The varieties of it include Mumbai Gujarati, Nagari, Patnuli, Saurashtra Standard.
* Gamadia: spoken primarily in Ahmedabad and the surrounding regions, in addition to Bharuch and Surat, where it is colloquially known as 'Surati'. The varieties of it include Ahmedabad Gamadia, Anawla, Brathela, Charotari, Eastern Broach Gujarati, Gramya, Patani, Patidari, Surati, Vadodari.
* Kathiawari: a distinctive variant spoken primarily in the [[Kathiawar]] region and subject to significant Sindhi influence. The varieties of it include Bhavnagari, Gohilwadi, Holadi/Halari, Jhalawadi, Sorathi.

Kharwa, Kakari and Tarimuki (Ghisadi) are also often cited as additional varieties of Gujarati.

* Parsi: spoken by the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Parsi]] minority. This highly distinctive variety has been subject to considerable lexical influence by [[Avestan]], the [[Liturgy|liturgical]] Zoroastrian language.
* [[Lisan ud-Dawat]]: spoken primarily by [[Gujarati Muslim]] [[Sunni Bohra|Bohra]] communities, it has been subject to greater lexical influence by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] and is written in the [[Arabic script]].

[[Kutchi language|Kutchi]] is often referred to as a dialect of Gujarati, but most linguists consider it closer to [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]]. In addition, a mixture between Sindhi, Gujarati, and Kutchi called [[Memoni language|Memoni]] is related to Gujarati, albeit distantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{e19|guj}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, words used by the native languages of areas where the [[Gujarati people]] have become a diaspora community, such as [[East Africa]] ([[Swahili Coast|Swahili]]), have become loanwords in local dialects of Gujarati.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ogilvie |first=Sarah |editor=Keith Brown |encyclopedia=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World |year=2009 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam, Netherlands |isbn=9780080877754 |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC&amp;pg=PA469#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Gujarati alphabet|Gujarati braille}}
Similar to other [[Nagari|Nāgarī]] writing systems, the Gujarati script is an [[abugida]]. It is used to write the Gujarati and [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]] languages. It is a variant of [[Devanāgarī]] script differentiated by the loss of the characteristic horizontal line running above the letters and by a small number of modifications in the remaining characters.

Gujarati and closely related languages, including [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]] and [[Parkari Koli language|Parkari Koli]], can be written in the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] or [[Persian script]]s. This is traditionally done by many in Gujarat's [[Kutch]] district.

==Vocabulary==

===Categorisation and sources===
These are the three general categories of words in modern Indo-Aryan: ''tatsam'', ''tadbhav'', and loanwords.&lt;ref&gt;Snell, R. (2000) ''Teach Yourself Beginner's Hindi Script.'' Hodder &amp; Stoughton. pp. 83–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tadbhav====
{{lang|gu|તદ્ભવ}} ''tadbhava'', "of the nature of that". Gujarati is a modern Indo-Aryan language descended from [[Sanskrit]] (old Indo-Aryan), and this category pertains exactly to that: words of Sanskritic origin that have demonstratively undergone change over the ages, ending up characteristic of modern Indo-Aryan languages specifically as well as in general. Thus the "that" in "of the nature of that" refers to Sanskrit. They tend to be non-technical, everyday, crucial words; part of the spoken vernacular. Below is a table of a few Gujarati ''tadbhav'' words and their Old Indo-Aryan sources:

|}

====Tatsam====
{{lang|gu|તત્સમ}} ''tatsama'', "same as that". While Sanskrit eventually stopped being spoken vernacularly, in that it changed into [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indo-Aryan]], it was nonetheless standardized and retained as a literary and [[liturgical language]] for long after. This category consists of these borrowed words of (more or less) pure Sanskrit character. They serve to enrich Gujarati and modern Indo-Aryan in its formal, technical, and religious vocabulary. They are recognizable by their Sanskrit inflections and markings; they are thus often treated as a separate grammatical category unto themselves.

{| class="wikitable"
!Tatsam
!English
!Gujarati
|-
||''lekhak''||[[wikt:writer|writer]]||''lakhnār''
|-
||''vijetā''||[[wikt:winner|winner]]||''jītnār''
|-
||''vikǎsit''||[[wikt:developed|developed]]||''vikǎselũ''
|-
||''jāgǎraṇ''||[[wikt:awakening|awakening]]||''jāgvānũ''
|}

Many old tatsam words have changed their meanings or have had their meanings adopted for modern times. પ્રસારણ ''prasāraṇ'' means "spreading", but now it is used for "[[wikt:broadcasting|broadcasting]]". In addition to this are [[neologism]]s, often being [[calque]]s. An example is ''[[wikt:telephone|telephone]]'', which is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "far talk", translated as દુરભાષ ''durbhāṣ''. Though most people just use ફોન ''phon'' and thus neo-Sanskrit has varying degrees of acceptance.

So, while having unique ''tadbhav'' sets, modern IA languages have a common, higher ''tatsam'' pool. Also, ''tatsam''s and their derived ''tadbhav''s can also co-exist in a language; sometimes of no consequence and at other times with differences in meaning:

|}

What remains are words of foreign origin (''videśī''), as well as words of local origin that cannot be pegged as belonging to any of the three prior categories (''deśaj''). The former consists mainly of [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic]], and English, with trace elements of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkish]]. While the phenomenon of English [[loanword]]s is relatively new, Perso-Arabic has a longer history behind it. Both English and Perso-Arabic influences are quite nationwide phenomena, in a way paralleling ''tatsam'' as a common vocabulary set or bank. What's more is how, beyond a transposition into general Indo-Aryan, the Perso-Arabic set has also been assimilated in a manner characteristic and relevant to the specific Indo-Aryan language it is being used in, bringing to mind ''tadbhav''.

====Perso-Arabic====
India was ruled for many a century by Persian-speaking [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Muslims]], amongst the most notable being the [[Turkic peoples|Turko]]-[[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[Delhi Sultanate]], and the [[Turco-Mongol]] [[Mughal dynasty]]. As a consequence Indian languages were changed greatly, with the large scale entry of Persian and its many Arabic loans into the Gujarati lexicon. One fundamental adoption was Persian's conjunction "that", ''ke''. Also, while ''tatsam'' or Sanskrit is etymologically continuous to Gujarati, it is essentially of a differing grammar (or language), and that in comparison while Perso-Arabic is etymologically foreign, it has been in certain instances and to varying degrees grammatically indigenized. Owing to centuries of situation and the end of Persian education and power, (1) Perso-Arabic loans are quite unlikely to be thought of or known as loans, and (2) more importantly, these loans have often been Gujarati-ized. ''dāvo'' – claim, ''fāydo'' – benefit, ''natījo'' – result, and ''hamlo'' – attack, all carry Gujarati's masculine gender marker, ''o''. ''khānũ'' – compartment, has the neuter ''ũ''. Aside from easy slotting with the auxiliary ''karvũ'', a few words have made a complete transition of verbification: ''kabūlvũ'' – to admit (fault), ''kharīdvũ'' – to buy, ''kharǎcvũ'' – to spend (money), ''gujarvũ'' – to pass. The last three are definite part and parcel.

Below is a table displaying a number of these loans. Currently some of the etymologies are being referenced to an Urdu [[dictionary]] so that Gujarati's singular masculine ''o'' corresponds to Urdu ''ā'', neuter ''ũ'' groups into ''ā'' as Urdu has no neuter gender, and Urdu's Persian ''z'' is not upheld in Gujarati and corresponds to ''j'' or ''jh''. In contrast to modern Persian, the pronunciation of these loans into Gujarati and other Indo-Aryan languages, as well as that of Indian-recited Persian, seems to be in line with Persian spoken in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Central Asia]], perhaps 500&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref name="Masica75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Masica|1991|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, Persian, being part of the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian language family]] as Sanskrit and Gujarati are, met up in some instances with its cognates:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Masica|1991|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====English====
[[File:Fruit juice shop in Navsari.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|test|''śrī sarasvatī fruṭ jyuś sɛnṭar'' – "[[Sri|Shri]] [[Saraswati]] [[wikt:fruit|fruit]] [[wikt:juice|juice]] Centre". Note that "Fruit Juice Centre" is in English. A Gujarati alternative would be ''phaḷnā ras nu kendra''. It (''kendra'' in particular) would however sound quite [[pedantic]] and out of place.]]
With the end of Perso-Arabic inflow, English became the current foreign source of new vocabulary. English had and continues to have a considerable influence over Indian languages. Loanwords include new innovations and concepts, first introduced directly through [[British Empire|British colonialism]], and then streaming in on the basis of continued [[English language]] dominance in the post-colonial period. Besides the category of new ideas is the category of English words that already have Gujarati counterparts which end up replaced or existed alongside with. The major driving force behind this latter category has to be the continuing role of English in modern India as a language of education, prestige, and mobility. In this way, Indian speech can be sprinkled with English words and expressions, even switches to whole sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Masica|1991|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See [[Hinglish]], [[Code-switching]]''.

In matters of sound, English [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] consonants map as [[Retroflex consonant|retroflexes]] rather than [[Dental consonant|dentals]]. Two new characters were created in Gujarati to represent English /æ/'s and /ɔ/'s. Levels of Gujarati-ization in sound vary. Some words don't go far beyond this basic transpositional rule, and sound much like their English source, while others differ in ways, one of those ways being the carrying of dentals. ''See [[Indian English]]''.

As English loanwards are a relatively new phenomenon, they adhere to English grammar, as ''tatsam'' words adhere to Sanskrit. Though that isn't to say that the most basic changes have been underway: many English words are pluralized with Gujarati ''o'' over English "s". Also, with Gujarati having three genders, genderless English words must take one. Though often inexplicable, gender assignment may follow the same basis as it is expressed in Gujarati: vowel type, and the nature of word meaning.

====Portuguese====
The smaller foothold the Portuguese had in wider India had linguistic effects. Gujarati took up a number of words, while elsewhere the influence was great enough to the extent that creole languages came to be (''see [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese-based creole languages#India and Sri Lanka|Portuguese-based creole languages in India and Sri Lanka]]''). Comparatively, the impact of Portuguese has been greater on coastal languages&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Masica|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their loans tend to be closer to the Portuguese originals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Masica|1991|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source dialect of these loans imparts an earlier pronunciation of ''ch'' as an affricate instead of the current standard of [ʃ].&lt;ref name="Masica75"/&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Main|Gujarati grammar}}
Gujarati is a head-final, or left-[[Branching (linguistics)|branching]] language. [[Adjective]]s precede [[noun]]s, [[direct object]]s come before [[verb]]s, and there are [[postposition]]s. The [[word order]] of Gujarati is [[subject–object–verb|SOV]], and there are three [[grammatical gender|genders]] and two [[grammatical number|numbers]]. There are no [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]]s. A verb is expressed with its [[Root (linguistics)|verbal root]] followed by [[suffix]]es marking [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] in what is called a main form, with a possible proceeding [[Auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] form derived from ''to be'', marking [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical mood|mood]], and also showing agreement. [[Causative]]s (up to double) and passives have a morphological basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mistry|2001|pp=276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Gandhiji's hut-Karadi

:After the world-famous [[Salt Satyagraha|Dandi March]] Gandhiji resided here in a [[date palm]] [[bark (botany)|bark]] hut underneath a/the [[mango tree]], from 14-4-1930 to 4-5-1930. From here he gave speed to and spread country-wide the anti-Salt Law struggle, started in Dandi on 6 April. From ''here'', writing in a letter, he notified the British Viceroy of his resolve of marching towards the [[salt]] [[mound]]s of Dharasana.

:The British government arrested him at this location, after twelve o'clock on the night of 4 May 1930.

'''Translation''' (provided at location) —

:Gandhiji's hut-Karadi

:Here under the mango tree in the hut made of palm leaves (khajoori) Gandhiji stayed from 14-4-1930 to 4-5-1930 after the world famous Dandi march. From here he gave impetus to the civil disobedience movement for breaking the salt act started on 6 April at Dandi and turned it into a nationwide movement. It was also from this place that he wrote a letter to the British viceroy expressing his firm resolve to march to the salt works at Dharasana.

:This is the place from where he was arrested by the British government after midnight on 4 May 1930.

==Life and career==

He was educated at the county school in [[Ystalyfera]] before obtaining a degree in Welsh at [[University College, Cardiff]].  He then moved to [[Jesus College, Oxford]] and studied with [[Sir John Rhys]].  After teaching in Ystalyfera and [[Llanelli]] county schools, he served as a [[sergeant]] in the [[Welsh Guards]] and a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] during the First World War.  After the war, he was an assistant lecturer in the Welsh department at Cardiff before being appointed Professor of Welsh Language and Literature at [[University College, Swansea]] in 1921.  He held this position until his retirement in 1954, when he was awarded the [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]]. He died on 14 January 1968.&lt;ref name=WBO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-LEWI-HEN-1889.html|title=Lewis, Henry (1889&amp;ndash;1968), Welsh and Celtic scholar, university professor|last=Lloyd|first=David Myrddin|work=Welsh Biography Online|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked on comparative Celtic studies, writing a grammar of Middle Cornish and of Middle Breton.  He was a member of the editorial committee of the University of Wales Welsh Dictionary and of ''Y Caniedydd'', the hymnal of Welsh Independents.  He also worked on translating government reports and served on various public bodies including the [[Welsh Joint Education Committee]] and the council of [[Coleg Harlech]] (later becoming Chairman).

The '''Horse Amphora''' is the name given to a [[Melian pithamphora]] in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]] with the inventory number 913. It is dated to around 660 BC.

The Horse Amphora is the oldest known Melian Amphora and is among the largest examples of the type. The amphora is 88 centimetres high, the lid is not preserved.

The name of the vessel derives from its main image, which shows two slim, graceful, long-legged horses standing beside each other. The two are separated by a [[Palmette]]. While their bodies are shown as silhouettes, the heads are depicted in outline. The empty space was filled with various motifs, including zigzags which recall earlier images of [[Group Ad]], though the drawings are far more detailed than those of the Ad Group. Along with the zigzags, there are also double-[[volute]]s and leaf-[[rosette (design)|rosette]]s. Out-turned double-volutes are found on the neck which are filled with cross-hatching. The two ornamental bands of the vessel's body are decorated with simpler double-volutes and concentric circles. The horizontal double handles are reminiscent of goats' horns (or, really, anything curved...). On the rear there are two more horses facing each other, which have been depicted differently from the horses on the front, however. Both sides were decorated therefore, but the rear has mostly flaked off. 

The horse motif fits with its use as a grave vase, since the horse had sepulchral symbolism.

'''''Ibadah''''' ({{lang-ar|{{large| عبادة}}}},&amp;nbsp;''‘ibādah'', also spelled '''''ibada''''') is an [[Arabic]] word meaning service or servitude.&lt;ref name=OEIW&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tariq al-Jamil|title=Ibadah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001/acref-9780195305135-e-1162|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], ''ibadah'' is usually translated as "worship", and ''ibadat''—the plural form of ''ibadah''—refers to Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') of Muslim religious rituals.&lt;ref name="BORW"/&gt;

==Ibadah==
In Arabic ''ibadah'' is connected with related words such as "Ubudiyyah" ("[[slavery]]"), and has connotations of obedience, submission, and humility. The word linguistically means "obedience with submission".&lt;ref&gt;al-Qamoos al-Muhit&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], ''ibadah'' is usually translated as "worship"  and means  obedience, submission, and devotion to [[God in Islam|God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Qur'an 51:56|url=http://quran.com/51/56}} [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-51/verse-56/ Quran Surah Adh-Dhaariyat ( Verse 56 )]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt;

''Ibadat'' (عبادات ) is the plural form of ''ibādah''.

Ibadat include what are known as the "[[Five Pillars of Islam|pillars of Islam]]": 
* profession of faith ([[Shahada|shahadah]]), translated as "''There is no god other than [[Allah]]. Muhammad is the messenger of [[Allah]]"'';&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt;
* ritual prayer ([[Salah|salat]]), observed five times every day at prescribed times, with prescribed preparations (ritual cleaning), prescribed movements (standing, bowing, prostrating, sitting) and prescribed verses, phrases;&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt;
* alms giving ([[Zakat|zakah]]) -- customarily 2.5% of a Muslim's total savings and wealth above a minimum amount  known as&amp;nbsp;''[[nisab]]'',&amp;nbsp;which is based on income and the value of all of one's possessions;&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt;
* fasting ([[Fasting in Islam|sawm]]) -- the obstention from eating and drinking during daylight hours -- especially during the&amp;nbsp;[[Islamic holy month]]&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;[[Ramadan]];&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt; 
* pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] ([[hajj]])&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt; -- the annual&amp;nbsp;[[Islam|Islamic]]&amp;nbsp;[[pilgrimage]] to the most holy city of the Muslims, and a&amp;nbsp;[[Fard|mandatory religious duty]]&amp;nbsp;for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult&amp;nbsp;[[Muslim|Muslims]]&amp;nbsp;who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey, and can support their family during their absence.  
According to Oxford Islamic Studies, "because they are of central importance to the Muslim community, the ibadat form the first subject matter of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] and most collections of prophetic traditions ([[hadith]])."&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt; The subject of ibadat is especially important in Islam (according to author Faleel Jamaldeen) because without these religious laws, "Muslims would likely create their own rituals and prayers, and the religion of Islam would falter and eventually disappear."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Islamic_Finance_For_Dummies.html?id=T7ImTjBd1gQC|title=Islamic Finance For Dummies|last=Jamaldeen|first=Faleel|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal Law № 40-FZ "On [[Bankruptcy|Insolvency (Bankruptcy)]] of Credit Institutions" dated 25 February 1999 (as amended) (the "Insolvency Law of Credit Institutions") contains special provisions in relation to the opening of insolvency proceedings in relation to the credit company. Insolvency Provisions Act, credit organizations used in conjunction with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.

Bankruptcy law provides for the following stages of insolvency proceedings:

* The economic recovery (finansovoe ozdorovleniye);
* External control (vneshneye upravleniye);
* Liquidation (konkursnoye proizvodstvo) and
* Comprehensive Agreement (mirovoye soglasheniye).

The main face of the [[bankruptcy]] process is the insolvency officer (trustee in bankruptcy). At various stages of bankruptcy, he has to be determined: the temporary officer, external control, the receiver or administrative officer. During the bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy (insolvency officer) has a decisive influence on the movement of assets (property) of the debtor - the debtor and has a key influence on the economic and legal aspects of its operations.

The powers of the liquidator, depending on the phase of the competition depends on the question. For example, the interim manager has no right to manage the affairs of the debtor during the monitoring step, but has the right to do so at a later stage.
In the settlement process, current liabilities have priority and are satisfied before other claims are met.
Claims priority:
* First, the claims for damages to life or human health and moral damage;
* Second, the claim for breach obligations in respect of salaries and other payments to the relation to employment and royalties and
* Third, other requirements, with the exception of required by the above described procedure, it can still be to the satisfaction of all rights to satisfy the priority.

To understand past cultures [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] analyze many artifacts. [[Pottery#Africa|Pottery]] proves to be of most importance to the [[archaeological record]]. Pottery is durable and even allows its broken fragments to withstand time, which would otherwise decompose other artifacts. More importantly, the style of pottery often changes through time, and shifts in shape, size, or decoration can be used to resolve the age of the artifact and/or site. Furthermore, though pottery is common, different cultures had their own distinct styles that can be used to determine its similarities or differences with one another. Therefore, even fragments of pottery can reconstruct many facets of past cultures.

== Kansyore Pottery ==
	Throughout the ages, [[ceramics]] such as Kansyore pottery, have provided archaeologists the opportunity to study past cultures.  Darla Dale and Ceri Z. Ashley state that, “[[Archaeological site|[archaeological] sites]] with Kansyore pottery are the only hunter-gatherer sites associated with large quantities of ceramics before the beginnings of food production in [[East Africa]] at 3000 to 2000 BC”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Holocene hunter-fisher-gatherer communities: new perspectives on Kansyore Using communities of Western Kenya|last = Dale|first = Darla|date = 23 April 2010|journal = Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa|doi = 10.1080/00672700903291716|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Ashley|first2 = Ceri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evenmore, Dale and Ashley put forward earlier dates that “suggest they [are] among the earliest ceramic using hunter-gatherers in East Africa”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their research suggests that the pottery is evidence of change. The investigation into Kansyore pottery is important because it adds a new perspective on alternative [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gather]] life ways.	

	Research into Kansyore has provided a life-way that differs from other known East African Late Stone Age [[hunter-gatherers]] ([[Later Stone Age|LSA]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Kansyore communities of the LSA are marked with ceramics and a settlement pattern based on the exploitation of resources around the shoreline of lakes or rivers. Thus, the exploitation of marine resources fostered [[sedentism]] and the production of Kansyore pottery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Geographic Distribution and Context ==
Kansyore ceramics have been found in [[East Africa]]
([[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Sudan|southeastern Sudan]]). More specifically, this particular pottery is located around the [[Lake Victoria]] basin. Most sites associated with Kansyore pottery are nearby bodies of water, such [[River|rivers]] or [[Lake|lakes]]. For example, assemblages are “loosely concentrated” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; around [[Lake Victoria]]. To list a few areas and sites: 
*[[Gogo Falls]], [[Kenya]].
*Usenge, Kenya.
*Siror, Kenya.
*[[Tanzania|northern Tanzania]].
The concentration of Kansyore pottery in geographical areas associated with water suggests something about the hunter-gatherer’s lifeways. This settlement pattern suggests a specialized [[subsistence economy]] based on aquatic food. Furthermore, the subsistence strategy of fish and shellfish is the result of seasonal exploitation of  food sources:
* River sites were exploited for fishing during the wet season.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Lake sites were exploited during the dry season for the collection of shellfish and easily caught fish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Typology: Description of Pottery==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kansyore Gogo.jpg|thumb|(copyright: Peter Robertshaw; used with permission)
The collection from Gogo Falls, Kenya, is the largest known example of well-preserved Kansyore pottery, and it has been used as a reference for comparisons&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Early Iron Age and Kansyore Pottery: Finds from Gogo Falls, South Nyanza|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00672708009511280|journal = Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa|date = 1980-01-01|issn = 0067-270X|pages = 133–145|volume = 15|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/00672708009511280|first = D. P.|last = Collett|first2 = P. T.|last2 = Robertshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]] --&gt;
Kansyore pottery’s uniqueness is a result of applied tools and techniques. This caused the design of the pottery to display distinct decorations that covered most of the exterior surface.  The vessels themselves run a spectrum from medium-sized to hemispherical bowls with varying rim designs, such as ''rounded'', ''tapered'', and occasionally ''spurred''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  To classify, Dale developed an approach to identify Kansyore pottery:
*'''Four techniques''': ''appliqué, incision, rocker, and simple impression''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*'''Eight motifs''': ''serrated-edge, serrated-edge zigzag, plain-edge zigzag, punctate, punctate circular motif, appliqué, incision, and impression''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
Within each of these categories certain techniques were applied to achieve the desired design. For example, in the ''appliqué'' technique clay pieces were attached to the clay body in circular or oblong shapes, yet within the motifs categories were many variations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gogo Falls Collection ===
The Kansyore collection from [[Gogo Falls]] is the largest known example of well-preserved Kansyore pottery, and it has been used as a reference for comparisons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Collett and Robertshaw applied the Kansyore collection from Gogo Falls to resolve classification issues with  ceramics from [[Kantsyore Island]], [[Nyang'oma]], and [[Mumba Hohle|Mumba-Hohle]]. 
* '''Kantsyore Island'''.
** All the sherds from Kantsyore Island depicted the same style as the collection from Gogo Falls.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* '''Nyang' oma'''.
** All of the sherds can be assigned to the Kansyore assemblage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Mumba Hohle'''.
** Because some the pottery includes different stylistic qualities, such as ''aereal motifs'', only some of the pottery, that depict ''panels'' and ''multiple bands of vertical punctates'', may belong in the Kansyore tradition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Thus, the ceramic assemblages found at the sites stated above belong to the Kansyore tradition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This cannot be said for other ceramic assemblages. For instance, it was believed that Kansyore pottery was discovered at the Lukenya Hill and Salasun sites. However, Collett and Robertshaw used the Gogo Falls collection as a reference, and were able to subscribe the ceramics in the [[Rift valley|central Rift Valley]] to the [[Nderit tradition]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Lukenya Hill'''.
** Ceramics  depicted  either a ''dragged comb'' or ''twisted cordroulette'' style that does not match the Kansyore tradition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Salasun'''.
** The Salasun assemblage has not been fully described, though at least part of the assemblage has been assigned to the Nderit tradition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
The above-mentioned comparisons show that some assemblages have been wrongly identified as the Kansyore entity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Associations and Non-Ceramic Artifacts ==
Significant '''non-ceramic''' '''artifacts''' found associated with Kansyore pottery are:
* [[middens|Shell middens]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = New Dates for Kansyore and Urewe Wares from Northern Nyanza, Kenya|last = Lane|first = Paul|date = 29 July 2009|journal = Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa|doi = 10.1080/00672700609480438|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Ashley|first2 = Ceri|last3 = Oteyo|first3 = Gilbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Personal adornment at Usenge, Pundo, and Siror&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Rounded pebble at Pundo&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Lithics&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Early Iron Age and Kansyore Pottery: Finds from Gogo Falls, South Nyanza|last = Collett|first = D.P.|date = 1998|journal = Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa|doi = 10.1080/00672708009511280|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Robertshaw|first2 = P.T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bone points&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Associated ceramic artifacts ===

* Urewe ware&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Early Iron Age ceramic&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Nderit&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
The fact that Kansyore pottery was found in varying contexts and with other artifacts illustrates transition and change. This is seen in the Early Phase of the Kansyore. To illustrate, 8 rounded pebbles were found in one test pit at Pundo, their function range from grinding red [[ochre]] to grinding plants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Bone points]] used for fishing were discovered at Usenge 1 and Pundo, and [[personal adornment]], such as bone or shell beads, were found at Usenge 1, Pundo, and Siror.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, the non-ceramic artifacts indicate that specialized materials were already being made before the introduction of pottery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Chronology ==
The [[chronology]] for Kansyore has been a source of discourse for many archaeologists. Dates for Kansyore cover 6000 years with the earliest dates, 7819 to 6590 cal. [[Common Era|BC]], coming from [[Luanda, Kenya|Luanda in Kenya]], while the latest dates, [[Anno Domini|AD]] 1-120, coming from Wadh Lang'o.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Discussing Chronology and typology ===

The overbearing time frame of the dates briefed above has caused many to question the validity of the '''Kansyore tradition'''. D.P Collett and P.T. Robertshaw assert that "dates associated with Kansyore assemblages cover a long period."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Their recounting of Mehlmans' skepticism, however, results from the fact that "either a very conservative tradition or large dating errors&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Early Iron Age and Kansyore Pottery: Finds from Gogo Falls, South Nyanza|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00672708009511280|journal = Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa|date = 1980-01-01|issn = 0067-270X|pages = 133–145|volume = 15|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/00672708009511280|first = D. P.|last = Collett|first2 = P. T.|last2 = Robertshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;" disallow for accurate chronology. Evidence suggest that the former reasoning is the cause for the chronology, and the dating for Kansyore pottery from East Africa suggest that it was a long lived tradition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Chronology is important to Dale's and Ashley's research. With their findings, they were able to ascertain two phases of the Kansyore tradition. First is the '''''Early Phase''''', which was 5468-5299 cal. BC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Second is the '''''Late Terminal Kansyore Phase''''', which dates to the mid-second millennium BC and terminal second early first millennia cal BC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Early Phase is illustrated at sites such as Siror, Pundo, and Usenge 1. In Siror dated material corroborate with Dale's and Ashley's sequence of the Early Phase. For example, a [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] date of [[charcoal]], found in Trench 1, is dated to 5468-5299 BC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The typology of ceramics found in the Early phase at Siror is the ''punctate'' motif, while the Late Terminal phase shows a high frequency of the ''rocker-stamp motif''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Late Terminal Kansyore Phase is identified at Usenge 3 and Trench 2 in Siror. Again, artifacts radiocarbon dates, ranging from 3310 +/1 40 BP and 3240 +/- 70 BP,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; supports Dale's sequence of the Kansyore tradition. Missing in the sequence is a phase for the middle Kansyore period because more research is needed to develop a full picture of change, yet the dating provided by the sequence allows reconstruction of the Kansyore tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Life ways of the Early and Late Kansyore phases. ==
The above-mentioned sections illustrate the amount of research into the Kansyore tradition. Research into the Kansyore has provided more insight into the lifeways of those who created the pottery. [[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]], such as pottery, in which the originators are no longer tangible entities, allow archaeologists the ability to interpret it.

Dale and Ashley illustrate the difference between Early and Late Kansyore by using ceramic and non-ceramic archaeological material from Siror, and at the same time speak about the culture of the pottery makers. Thus, in the early phase of Siror, the large quantities of fish bones suggest that many people whom had a fish-based subsistence economy occupied the site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As stated above, ceramic evidence at the early phase was punctate, but shifted to rocker-stamped motif in the later Kansyore period. With the shift in ceramic decoration, more emphasis on terrestrial mammals for subsistence became apparent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The transition to the use of ceramics was not a swift transition. In fact, evidence shows that ceramic use was slowly applied and may have come after specialized subsistence economies. For instance, shell middens in Usenge 1 and Pundo show low ceramic density.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even more, non-ceramic artifacts, such as bone points, indicate that other material culture linked to specific activities and economies existed before ceramics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nonetheless, even if the transition to ceramic use was slow and part of a process of change, by the Early Kansyore Phase, 5648-5299 cal. BC, it became a central part of the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Evidence for a shift in subsistence economy and social relations in the Later Terminal Kansyore Phase is seen in Siror and Usenge 3. At these sites a decline of fish resource exploitation is experienced and a rise in terrestrial mammals is emphasized. For example, in Usenge 3 the upper layers of deposit including terrestrial animals, such as cattle, overlaid a Kansyore shell midden.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to the terrestrial animals, the Kansyore ceramics in the upper layers of deposit depicted a decline in decoration and technological quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is taken as evidence for social contact with late hunter-gather-fishers and farming societies. Thus, in the Later Terminal Kansyore Phase, the fishing to hunting society was going through a local change brought on by contact with other societies.

A '''memory law''' (French ''loi mémorielle'',  German ''Erinnerungsgesetz'') is a law that enshrines state-approved interpretations of particular historical events and promotes certain narratives about the past, often at the expense of alternative historical interpretations. Memory laws are important elements of state-sanctioned [[politics of memory]].

Memory laws are found in both [[hard law]] and [[soft law]].
* Hard law: for example [[Laws against Holocaust denial|criminal bans]] on [[Holocaust denial]] and the [[Genocide denial|denial]] or gross trivialization of other genocides.
* Soft law: [[Nudge theory|nudges]] incentivizing others to act in a certain way, for example a [[European Parliament]] resolution to commemorate the [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian genocide]].
Another conceptual binary is division between positive and negative memory laws.
* Positive memory laws: for example national [[parliamentary resolution]]s recognizing the Armenian genocide, the EU Parliament’s resolutions establishing a European “duty to remember”
* Negative memory laws: for example laws criminalizing genocide denial or gross trivialization, bans on propagation of totalitarian ideologies

== History of memory laws ==
[[Peace of Westphalia]] is considered as example of forgiveness of oblivion model, the same as more contemporary [[Pact of forgetting|Pact of Forgetting]] in post-Franco Spain and the [[Thick line|thick line policy]] of [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]]'s government in [[Poland]].

The model of zelous remembrance is examplified by actions of [[Jacobin]]s during the [[French Revolution]] and by ‘War Guilt Clause” in [[Treaty of Versailles]] which ended the [[World War I|First World War]].[http://www.law.qmul.ac.uk/research/funded/MELA/about/index.html]

== Holocaust and genocide denial ==
* [[Laws against Holocaust denial|Laws against Holocaust Denial]]
* Recognition of [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian genocide]] by 2001 law in France and in political documents, usually in [http://www.mfa.am/en/what-is-genocide/ parliamentary resolutions]

== Decommunization ==
* [[Bans on Communist symbols|Bans on symbols and imagery propagating Stalinism and Communism]], public spaces and street names' changes, and removal of monuments. The legislation was discussed for example in Poland, Estonia, Bulgaria, and [[Decommunization in Ukraine|Ukraine]].
* [[Lustration]]
* [[Economic, social and cultural rights|Economic and social rights]] and memory laws, for example laws on pensions of former employees of Secret Services

[[Ukraine]] emerges as the concept of a nation, and the [[Ukrainians]] as a nationality, with the [[Ukrainian National Revival]] which is believed started sometime at the end of 18th and the beginning of 19th century. According to Ukrainian historian [[Yaroslav Hrytsak]], the first wave of national revival is traditionally connected with publication of the first part of "Eneyida" by [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky]] (1798).&lt;ref name=oohou&gt;[[Yaroslav Hrytsak]]. ''[http://history.franko.lviv.ua/gryc_r1.htm Overview of the History of Ukraine]''. Part I.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846 in Moscow was published "[[History of Ruthenians|Istoriya Rusov ili Maloi Rossii]]" (History of Ruthenians or Little Russia). During the [[Spring of Nations]], in 1848 in Lemberg ([[Lviv]]) was created [[Supreme Ruthenian Council]] which declared that Galician Ruthenians are part of bigger Ukrainian nation.&lt;ref name=oohou/&gt; The council adopted the yellow and blue flag ([[Flag of Ukraine]]).&lt;ref name=oohou/&gt;

Ukraine first declared its independence with the [[Ukrainian–Soviet War|invasion of Bolsheviks]] in the late of 1917. Following the conclusion of the [[World War I]] and with the [[peace of Riga]], Ukraine was partitioned once again between Poland and the [[Bolshevik Russia]], which on its occupied territory created own puppet state of its pocket communist party, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

In 1922, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], together with the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]], became the founding member of the  [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Soviet famine of 1932–33]] or [[Holodomor]] killed an estimated 6 to 8 million people in the Soviet Union,  the majority of them in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/612921/Ukraine/275912/Industrialization-and-collectivization{{spaced ndash}}"The famine of 1932–33"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Quote: "The Great Famine (Holodomor) of 1932–33 – a man-made demographic catastrophe unprecedented in peacetime. Of the estimated six to eight million people who died in the Soviet Union, about four to five million were Ukrainians... Its deliberate nature is underscored by the fact that no physical basis for famine existed in Ukraine... Soviet authorities set requisition quotas for Ukraine at an impossibly high level. Brigades of special agents were dispatched to Ukraine to assist in procurement, and homes were routinely searched and foodstuffs confiscated... The rural population was left with insufficient food to feed itself."&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting out the [[World War II]] with the [[Nazi Germany]] and being excluded from the [[League of Nations]], in 1941 the Soviet Union [[Operation Barbarossa|was invaded]] by Germany and [[Axis forces|its other allies]]. Many Ukrainians initially regarded the [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers as liberators from Soviet rule, while others formed an [[Soviet partisans|anti-German partisan movement]]. Some elements of the Ukrainian nationalist underground formed a [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] that fought both Soviet and Nazi forces.

Sometime after the [[deportation of Crimean Tatars]], in 1954 the [[Crimean Oblast]] [[1954 transfer of Crimea|was transferred]] from the RSFSR to the Ukrainian SSR.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Ukraine became an independent state, formalised with a [[Ukrainian independence referendum, 1991|referendum on December 1]].
With the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union]], Ukraine now became an area of overlapping spheres of influence of the [[European Union]] and the [[Russian Federation]]. This manifested in a political split between the "pro-Russian" [[Eastern Ukraine]], and the "pro-European" [[Western Ukraine]], leading to an ongoing period of political turmoil, beginning with the "[[Orange Revolution]]" of 2004, and culminating in 2014 with the "[[Euromaidan]]" [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|uprising]] and the [[2014 Crimean Crisis|Crimean Crisis]], in which [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea|Crimea]] fell under the control of the [[Russian Federation]].

Following the 17th century failed attempt to regain statehood in form of [[Cossack Hetmanate]], the future Ukrainian territory again ended up divided between three empires, the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

In the second half of the 18th century the [[Catherine the Great|Catherinine]] Russian Empire instigated a hysteria in local Eastern Orthodox population by promising protection from [[Catholicism]] and support leading to an armed conflict [[Koliyivshchyna]] in the neighboring [[right-bank Ukraine]] which was part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and resulting in the Polish [[Bar Confederation]], Russian military invasion of Poland and its internal affairs, and successful [[partitions of Poland|partitions of the last]]. By the end of 18th century most of Ukraine was completely annexed by Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Orest Subtelny; [https://books.google.com/books?id=HNIs9O3EmtQC ''Ukraine: A History'']; University of Toronto Press; 2000. {{ISBN|0-8020-8390-0}}. pp 117-145-146-148&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time the Catherinine Russia gradually gained control over the area of [[Black Sea]] coast (northern Pontic coast) which was part the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] realm at the conclusion of the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of [[Russo-Turkish War, 1735-1739|1735–39]], [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774|1768–74]], [[Russo-Turkish War, 1787-1792|1787–92]].

The lands were generously given to the [[dvoryanstvo|nobility]] and the [[Russian serfdom|unfree peasantry]] were transferred to cultivate the [[Pontic steppe]]. Forcing the local [[Nogais|Nogai]] population out and resettling the Crimean Greeks, Catherine the Great renamed all populated places and invited other European settlers to these newly conquered lands: [[Polish minority in Russia|Poles]], [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|Germans]] ([[Black Sea Germans]], [[Crimea Germans]], [[Volga Germans]]), [[Swiss emigration to Russia|Swiss]], and others. To the southern Ukraine were deported some Estonian Swedes. Since then there exists the old Swedish village of [[Gammalsvenskby]]–Zmiivka.

Ukrainian writers and intellectuals [[Ukrainian nationalism|were inspired by the nationalistic spirit]] stirring other European peoples existing under other imperial governments.
Russia, fearing separatism, imposed strict limits on attempts to elevate the [[Ukrainian language]] and culture, even banning its use and study. The [[Russophilia|Russophile]] policies of [[Russification of Ukraine|Russification]] and [[Panslavism]] led to an exodus of a number some Ukrainian intellectuals into Western Ukraine, while others empbraced a Pan-Slavic or Russian identity, with many Russian authors or composers of the 19th century being of Ukrainian origin (notably [[Nikolai Gogol]] and  [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]).

In the [[Austrian Empire]] most of the elite that ruled Galicia were of Austrian or Polish descent, with the [[Ruthenians]] mostly representing the peasantry. During the 19th century, [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophilia]] was a common occurrence among the Slavic population, but the mass exodus of Ukrainian intellectuals escaping from Russian repression in Eastern Ukraine, as well as the intervention of Austrian authorities, caused the movement to be replaced by [[Ukrainophilia]], which would then cross-over into the Russian Empire.

==First World War, the revolutions and aftermath==
{{Main|Ukraine in World War I|Ukraine after the Russian Revolution}}
{{See also|Ukrainian War of Independence|Polish–Ukrainian War|Ukrainian State}}
When World War I and series of revolutions across Europe, including the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, shattered many existing empires such as the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] ones, people of Ukraine were caught in the middle. Between 1917 and 1919, several separate Ukrainian republics manifested independence, the [[anarchist]] [[Free Territory]], the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], and numerous [[Ukrainian SSR|Bolshevik revkoms]].

As the area of Ukraine fell into warfare and anarchy, it was also fought over by [[German Army (German Empire)|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian forces]], the [[Red Army]] of [[Bolshevik Russia]], the [[White Forces]] of [[General Denikin]], the [[Polish Army]], [[anarchist]]s led by [[Nestor Makhno]]. [[Kiev]] itself was occupied by many different armies. The city was captured by the Bolsheviks on 9 February 1918, by the Germans on 2 March 1918, by the Bolsheviks a second time on 5 February 1919, by the White Army on 31 August 1919, by Bolsheviks for a third time on 15 December 1919, by the Polish Army on 6 
May 1920,  and finally by the Bolsheviks for the fourth time on 12 June 1920.

The defeat in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] and then the failure of the [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski]]'s and [[Symon Petlura|Petliura]]'s ''[[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Warsaw agreement of 1920]]'' to oust the Bolsheviks during the [[Kiev Offensive|Kiev Operation]] led almost to the occupation of Poland itself. In course of the new [[Polish-Soviet War]] purpose of which changed from the 1920 led to the signing of the [[Peace of Riga]] in March 1921, and after which the part of [[Ukraine]] west of [[Zbruch river|Zbruch]] had been incorporated into [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], and the east became part of the Soviet Union as the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The capital of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was [[Kharkiv]]; in 1934, the capital was relocated to Kiev.

===Soviet Ukraine===

[[File:Ukposter.jpg|thumb|The [[Ukrainianization]] program aimed at fostering [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian ethnic identity]] among the population of Ukraine. This 1921 recruitment poster uses Ukrainian orthography to convey its message, "Son, join the school of [[Red Army|Red commanders]], and the defense of the Soviet Ukraine will be ensured".]]

The Ukrainian national idea lived on during the inter-war years and was even spread to a large territory with traditionally mixed population in the east and south that became part of the Ukrainian [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]]. The [[Ukrainian culture]] even enjoyed a revival due to Bolshevik concessions in the early Soviet years (until the early-1930s) known as the policy of [[Korenization]] ("indigenisation"). In these years, an impressive [[Ukrainization]] program was implemented throughout the republic.

The rapidly developed Ukrainian language based education system dramatically raised the literacy of the Ukrainophone rural population. Simultaneously, the newly-literate ethnic Ukrainians migrated to the cities, which became rapidly largely Ukrainianised—in both population and in education. Similarly expansive was an increase in Ukrainian language publishing and overall eruption of Ukrainian cultural life.

At the same time, the usage of Ukrainian was continuously encouraged in the workplace and in the government affairs as the recruitment of indigenous cadre was implemented as part of the korenisation policies. While initially, the party and government apparatus was mostly Russian-speaking, by the end of the 1920s the ethnic Ukrainians composed over one half of the membership in the Ukrainian communist party, the number strengthened by accession of [[Borotbists]], a formerly indigenously Ukrainian "independentist" and non-Bolshevik communist party.

Despite the ongoing [[Soviet Union]]-wide antireligious campaign, the Ukrainian national [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] church was created called the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] (UAOC). The Bolshevik government initially saw the national church as a tool in their goal to suppress the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] always viewed with the great suspicion by the regime for its being the cornerstone of pre-revolutionary [[Russian Empire]] and the initially strong opposition it took towards the regime change. Therefore, the government tolerated the new Ukrainian national church for some time and the UAOC gained a wide following among the Ukrainian peasantry.

[[File:DneproGES.jpg|thumb|A 1934 photo of the [[DnieproGES]] hydropower plant, a heavyweight of Soviet industrialization in Ukraine.]]

The change in the Soviet economic policies towards the fast-pace [[History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953)#Industrialisation in practice|industrialisation]] was marked by the 1928 introduction of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s first [[piatiletka]] (a five-year plan). The industrialisation brought about a dramatic economic and social transformation in traditionally agricultural Ukraine. In the first piatiletkas the industrial output of Ukraine quadrupled as the republic underwent a record industrial development. The massive influx of the rural population to the industrial centres increased the urban population from 19% to 34%.

==== Soviet collectivisation ====

{{Further|Collectivization in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic}}

However, the industrialisation had a heavy cost for the peasantry, demographically a backbone of the Ukrainian nation. To satisfy the state's need for increased food supplies and finance industrialisation, Stalin instituted a [[Collectivization in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|program of collectivisation]] of agriculture, which profoundly affected Ukraine, often referred to as the "breadbasket of the USSR". In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the state combined the peasants' lands and animals into collective farms. Starting in 1929, a policy of enforcement was applied, using regular troops and secret police to confiscate lands and materials where necessary.

Many resisted, and a desperate struggle by the peasantry against the authorities ensued. Some slaughtered their livestock rather than turn it over to the collectives. Wealthier peasants were labeled "[[kulak]]s", enemies of the state. Tens of thousands were executed and about 100,000 families were [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|deported to Siberia]] and Kazakhstan.

Forced collectivisation had a devastating effect on agricultural productivity. Despite this, in 1932 the Soviet government increased Ukraine's production quotas by 44%, ensuring that they could not be met. Soviet law required that the members of a collective farm would receive no grain until government quotas were satisfied. The authorities in many instances exacted such high levels of procurement from collective farms that starvation became widespread.
[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|Starved peasants on a street in [[Kharkiv]], 1933.]]
The [[Soviet famine of 1932–33]], called [[Holodomor]] in Ukrainian, claimed up to 10 million Ukrainian lives as peasants' food stocks were forcibly removed by [[Stalin]]'s regime by the [[NKVD]] secret police.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7111296.stm Ukraine remembers famine horror]". BBC News. November 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As elsewhere, the precise number of deaths by starvation in Ukraine may never be precisely known. That said, the most recent demographic studies suggest that over 4 million Ukrainians perished in the first six months of 1933 alone, a figure that increases if population losses from 1931, 1932 and 1934 are also included, along with those from adjacent territories inhabited primarily by Ukrainians (but politically part of the Russian Federated Soviet Socialist Republic), such as the [[Kuban]].

The Soviet Union suppressed information about this genocide, and as late as the 1980s admitted only that there was some hardship because of kulak sabotage and bad weather. Today, its existence is accepted.{{By whom|date=July 2009}} Non-Soviets maintain that the famine was an avoidable, deliberate act of genocide.

The times of industrialisation and collectivisation also brought about a wide campaign against "nationalist deviation" which in Ukraine translated into an assault on the national political and cultural elite. The first wave of purges between 1929 and 1934 targeted the revolutionary generation of the party that in Ukraine included many supporters of [[Ukrainization]]. [[Great Purge|The next 1936–1938 wave of political purges]] eliminated much of the new political generation that replaced those that perished in the first wave and halved the membership of the Ukrainian communist party.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30078/Ukraine Ukraine] article, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purged Ukrainian political leadership was largely replaced by the cadre sent from [[Russian SFSR|Russia]] that was also largely "rotated" by Stalin's purges. As the policies of Ukrainisation were halted (1931) and replaced by massive [[Russification]] approximately four-fifths of the Ukrainian cultural elite, intellectuals, writers, artists and clergy, had been "eliminated", executed or imprisoned, in the following decade.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Mass arrests of the hierarchy and clergy of the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] culminated in the liquidation of the church in 1930.

====Galicia and Volhynia under Polish rule====
[[File:PBW March 1919.png|thumb|right|The breaking of the [[Battle of Lwów (1918)|siege of Lviv]] by Poles (November 1919) and the Polish border at the [[Zbruch River]] by the war's end, with eastern Galicia (shown in blue) under the Polish control.]]
{{Main|History of Poland (1918–1939)}}

Following the end of World War I, the eastern part of the former Austrian province of [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]], as well as [[Volhynia]], which had belonged to the [[Russian Empire]], became the area of a [[Polish-Ukrainian War]]. The Ukrainians claimed these lands because they made up the majority of population there (except for cities, such as [[Lviv]]), while the Poles saw these provinces as [[Kresy|Eastern Borderlands]], a [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|historical part of their country]]. The war was won by the Poles, and their rule over these disputed lands was cemented after another [[Treaty of Riga|Polish victory]], in the [[Polish-Soviet War]]. While some Ukrainians [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|supported Poland]], their hopes for independence or autonomy were quickly dashed.

In the interbellum period, eastern Galicia was divided into three [[voivodeship|administrative units]] — [[Lwów Voivodeship]], [[Stanisławów Voivodeship]], and [[Tarnopol Voivodeship]], while in Volhynia, [[Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939)|Wołyń Voivodeship]] was created. The Ukrainian majority of these lands was often treated as second class citizens by the Polish authorities. The conflict escalated in the 1930s, with [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists#Pre-war activities|terrorist actions]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/454566/Terrorists_or_National_Heroes_Politics_of_the_OUN_and_the_UPA_In_Ukraine I. Katchanovski, Terrorists or National Heroes? Politics of the OUN and the UPA in Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] resulting in [[Pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia (1930)|increasingly heavy-handed actions]] by the Polish government. The tensions were further exacerbated by arrival of thousands of [[osadnik]]s, or Polish settlers, who were granted land, especially in Volhynia. [[Henryk Józewski]] advocated a self-governance autonomy for Ukrainians in Volhynia 1928–1938.&lt;ref&gt;T. Snyder, ''Sketches from a Secret War: A Polish Artist's Mission to Liberate Soviet Ukraine''&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish rule over the provinces ended in September 1939, following [[Polish September Campaign|Nazi]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet attack]]. After the [[Battle of Lvov (1939)|Battle of Lviv]], units of the [[Red Army]] entered regional capital, Lviv, and following the staged [[Elections to the People's Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus]], both eastern Galicia and Volhynia were annexed by the [[Soviet Union]].

A few days after the Germans invaded Poland, Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]] told an aide his long-term goal was the spread of Communism in Eastern Europe: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now [Poland] is a fascist state, oppressing the Ukrainians, Belorussians and so forth. The annihilation of that state under current conditions would mean one fewer bourgeois fascist state to contend with! What would be the harm if as a result of the rout off Poland we were to extend the socialist system onto new territories and populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Roberts|title=Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939–1953|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlRjy4qnH6cC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2006|publisher=Yale U.P.|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian [[Geoffrey Roberts]] notes that the comments marked a change from the previous "popular front" policy of Communist Party cooperation with other parties. He adds, "Stalin's immediate purpose was to present an ideological rationale for the Red Army's forthcoming invasion of Poland" and his main message was the need to avoid a revolutionary civil war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberts|title=Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939–1953|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlRjy4qnH6cC&amp;pg=PA36||pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Timothy D. Snyder]] suggests that, "Stalin may have reasoned that returning Galicia and Volhynia to Soviet Ukraine would help co-opt [[Ukrainian nationalism]]. Stalin perhaps saw a way to give both Ukrainians and Poles something they wanted, while binding them to the USSR."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Snyder|title=The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569–1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&amp;pg=PA182|year=2003|publisher=Yale UP|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov pact]], in September 1939, German and Soviet troops [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|divided the territory of Poland]], including [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] with its Ukrainian population. Next, after [[Battle of France|France surrendered]] to Germany, [[Romania]] ceded [[Bessarabia]] and northern [[Bukovina]] to [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum|Soviet demands]]. The Ukrainian SSR incorporated northern and southern districts of Bessarabia, the northern Bukovina, and additionally the Soviet-occupied [[Hertsa region]], but ceded the western part of the [[Moldavian ASSR]] to the newly created [[Moldavian SSR]]. All these territorial gains were internationally recognized by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]].
When [[Nazi Germany]] with [[Axis powers|its allies]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in 1941, many Ukrainians and Polish people, particularly in the west where they had experienced two years of harsh Soviet rule, initially regarded the [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers as liberators. Retreating Soviets [[NKVD prisoner massacres|murdered thousands of prisoners]]. Some Ukrainian activists of the national movement hoped for a momentum to establish an independent state of Ukraine. German policies initially gave some encouragement to such hopes through the vague promises of sovereign 'Greater Ukraine' as the Germans were trying to take advantage of anti-Soviet, anti-Ukrainian, anti-Polish, and anti-Jewish sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luciuk| first=Lubomyr Y.|title=Searching for place: Ukrainian displaced persons, Canada, and the migration of memory|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2000|page=125|isbn=0-8020-4245-7|url=  https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN080208088X&amp;id=6srpcaGeuvcC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=ukrainians+under+germans&amp;sig=OTTMYCLmt0qe9mtdMFqPUPVKRYM#v=onepage&amp;q=ukrainians%20under%20germans&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local Ukrainian auxiliary police was formed as well as Ukrainian SS division, [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Galicia (1st Ukrainian)]]. However, after the initial period of a limited tolerance, the German policies soon abruptly changed and the Ukrainian national movement was brutally crushed.

Some Ukrainians, however, utterly resisted the Nazi onslaught from its start and a [[Soviet partisans|partisan movement]] immediately {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} spread over the occupied territory. Some elements of the Ukrainian nationalist underground formed a [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] that fought both Soviet and Nazi forces. In some western regions of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army survived underground and continued the resistance against the Soviet authorities well into the 1950s, though many Ukrainian civilians were murdered in this conflict by both sides.

[[File:Ruined Kiev in WWII.jpg|thumb|Burned out buildings in Kiev during the Second World War.]]
The Nazi administrators of conquered Soviet territories made little attempt to exploit the population's possible dissatisfaction with Soviet political and economic policies. Instead, the Nazis preserved the collective-farm system, systematically carried out genocidal policies against Jews, and deported many Ukrainians to forced labour in Germany. In their active resistance to Nazi Germany, the Ukrainians comprised a significant share of the Red Army and its leadership as well as the underground and resistance movements.

Total civilian losses during the War and German occupation in Ukraine are estimated at seven million, including over a million Jews shot and killed by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]''.
[[File:RIAN archive 472645 Wreath-laying ceremony in Babi Yar.jpg|thumbnail|Wreath-laying ceremony in [[Babi Yar]], where the Nazis murdered approximately 100,000 people]]
Many civilians fell victim to atrocities, forced labor, and even massacres of whole villages in reprisal for attacks against Nazi forces. Of the estimated eleven million Soviet troops who fell in battle against the Nazis, about 16% (1.7 million) were ethnic Ukrainians. Moreover, Ukraine saw some of the biggest battles of the war starting with the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|encirclement of Kiev]] (the city itself fell to the Germans on 19 September 1941 and was later acclaimed as a ''[[Hero City]]'') where more than 660,000 Soviet troops were taken captive, to the fierce defence of [[Odessa]], and on to the victorious storming across the [[Dnieper river]]. According to the researcher Rolf Michaelis who is referring to the [[SS-Hauptamt]]'s document No. 8699/42, the [[Polizei-Bataillon "Ostland"|Police Battalion "Ostland"]] (Field Post Number 47769) resided in the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] in 1941–1942, and was one of the main executioners of the [[Jew]]s. The Police Battalion "Ostland" was an [[Ordnungspolizei]] unit that served in [[World War II]] under the command of the [[Schutzstaffel]]. The battalion established in October 1941 carried out [[Anti-partisan operations in World War II|punitive duties]].&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Arico, Ordnungspolizei – Encyclopedia of the German police battalions September 1939 – July 1942, p. 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1941 the town of [[Rivne]] (Równe) was captured by [[Nazi Germany]], which later established the city as the administrative centre of the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]. In July 1941 the 1st company of the Police Battalion "Ostland" was in [[Frankfurt]], the rest of the battalion was in [[Rivne]]. In October 1941 the battalion was sent to [[Lviv]] (Lwów). At the time, roughly half of Równe's inhabitants were [[Jewish]]. About 23,000 of these people were taken to a pine grove in [[Sosenki]] and slaughtered by the 1st company of the Police Battalion "Ostland" between the November 6, and 8, 1941 (1st company). A [[ghetto]] was established for the remaining ca 5,000 Jews.&lt;ref name="Rolf Michaelis 1945"&gt;Rolf Michaelis, ''Der Einsatz der Ordnungspolizei 1939–1945.

On July 13–14, 1942, the remaining population of the Równe ghetto – about 5,000 Jews – was sent by train some 70 kilometres north to [[Kostopil]] (Kostopol) where they were murdered by the 1st company of the Police Battalion "Ostland" in a quarry near woods outside the town.

In November 1942 the Police Battalion Ostland together with an artillery regiment, and three other German [[Ordnungspolizei]] battalions under the command of ''Befehlshaber der Ordnungspolizei im Reichskommissariat Ukraine'' and ''SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei'' [[:de:Otto von Oelhafen|Otto von Oelhafen]], took part in a joint [[Anti-partisan operations in World War II|anti-partisan operation]] near [[Ovruch]] (Owrucz) with over 50 villages burnt down and over 1,500 people executed. In a village 40 people were burnt alive for revenge for the killing of the SS-[[Untersturmführer]] Türnpu(u).&lt;ref name="Weissrussland 1944"/&gt; In February 1943 the battalion was sent to Reval, Estland with [[293.

Kiev was recaptured by the Soviet Red Army on 6 November 1943.

During a period of March 1943 to the end of 1944 [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] committed several massacres on Polish civilian population in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia having every signs of genocide ([[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia]]). The death toll numbered up to 100 000, mostly children and women.&lt;ref name="Snyder B"&gt;Timothy Snyder.

After World War II some amendments to the Constitution of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] were accepted, which allowed it to act as a separate subject of [[international law]] in some cases and to a certain extent, remaining a part of the Soviet Union at the same time. In particular, these amendments allowed the Ukrainian SSR to become one of founding members of the [[United Nations]] (UN) together with the Soviet Union and the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]]. This was part of a deal with the [[United States]] to ensure a degree of balance in the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], which, the USSR opined, was unbalanced in favor of the Western Bloc. In its capacity as a member of the UN, the Ukrainian SSR was [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|an elected member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] in 1948–1949 and 1984–1985.

Over the next decades, the Ukrainian republic not only surpassed pre-war levels of industry and production but also was the spearhead of Soviet power. Ukraine became the centre of Soviet [[arms industry]] and high-tech research. The republic was also turned into a Soviet military outpost in the [[cold war]], a territory crowded by military bases packed with the most up-to-date weapons systems.

Such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite. Many members of the Soviet leadership came from Ukraine, most notably [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] a Soviet leader from 1964 to 1982, as well as many prominent Soviet sportsmen, scientists and artists. In 1954, the [[Russians|Russian]]-populated oblast of [[Crimea]] was transferred from the Russian to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic.

However, the relatively underdeveloped industrial branches such as [[coal mining|coal]]- and [[iron ore]] mining, [[metallurgy]], [[chemical industry|chemical]] and [[energy industry]] dominated the republic's economy. Once a [[Cossack]] steppe, the southern oblasts of [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast|Zaporizhzhia]] were turned into a highly industrialised area with rapidly increasing impact on its environment and public health. A pursuit to energy production sufficient for growing industry led to the gigantic nature-remastering: turning the [[Dnieper River]] into a regulated system of large reservoirs.

The products of the rapidly developed [[high-tech]] industry in Ukraine were largely directed for military consumption, similarly to much of the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]], and the supply and quality of [[consumer goods]] remained low compared even to the neighboring countries of the [[Eastern bloc]]. A state-regulated system of production and consumption lead to gradual decrease of quality of life and growing "shadowisation" of retail infrastructure as well as of corruption.
&lt;!--To be continued---&gt;

The town of [[Pripyat, Ukraine]] was the site of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], which occurred on April 26, 1986 when a nuclear plant exploded. The fallout contaminated large areas of northern Ukraine and even parts of [[Belarus]]. This spurred on a local independence movement called the [[People's Movement of Ukraine|Rukh]] that helped expedite the break-up of the Soviet Union during the late 1980s.

[[File:UkraineFlag.png|thumbnail|Modern [[Flag of Ukraine]]]]
On January 21, 1990, over 300,000 Ukrainians&lt;ref name="subtelny-576"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=Subtelny, Orest|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year= 2000|isbn=0-8020-8390-0|page=576|authorlink= Orest Subtelny}}&lt;/ref&gt; organised a human chain for Ukrainian independence between [[Kiev]] and [[Lviv]], in [[Act Zluky|memory of the 1919 unification]] of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[West Ukrainian National Republic]]. Citizens came out to the streets and highways, forming live chains by holding hands in support of unity.

Ukraine officially [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|declared itself an independent state on August 24, 1991]], when the communist Supreme Soviet (parliament) of Ukraine proclaimed that Ukraine will no longer follow the laws of USSR and only the laws of the Ukrainian SSR, de facto declaring Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union. On December 1, Ukrainian voters overwhelmingly approved a [[Ukrainian independence referendum, 1991|referendum formalising independence from the Soviet Union]]. Over 90% of Ukrainian citizens voted for independence, with majorities in every region, including 56% in [[Crimea]], which had a 75% ethnic Russian population. The Soviet Union formally ceased to exist on December 26, when the presidents of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia (the founding members of the USSR) met in [[Belovezh Pushcha]] to formally dissolve the Union in accordance with the Soviet Constitution. And with this Ukraine's independence was formalized de jure and recognised by the international community.

[[Poland]] and [[Canada]] were the first countries to recognize Ukraine's independence (both) on 2 December 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LNvTSDQXFXgC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=recognize+first+Ukraine's+independence+Poland&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PaoVUfvIH8LO0QXsnYCYDQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=recognize%20first%20Ukraine's%20independence%20Poland&amp;f=false Ukraine and Russia: The Post-Soviet Transition] by [[Roman Solchanyk]], [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers]], 2000, {{ISBN|0742510182}} (page 100)&lt;br&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=atpMYRcYBM4C&amp;pg=PA371&amp;dq=December+1991+recognize+Ukraine's+independence+Canada&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KKgVUenPLpS00QXv-YGgBA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=December%201991%20recognize%20Ukraine's%20independence%20Canada&amp;f=false Canadian Yearbook of International Law, Vol 30, 1992], [[University of British Columbia Press]], 1993, {{ISBN|9780774804387}} (page 371)&lt;br&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oLWeUoWEAGgC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=recognize+Ukraine's+independence+Poland&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6KoVUbzLBuyW0QWl2IGYBw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=recognize%20Ukraine's%20independence%20Poland&amp;f=false Russia, Ukraine, and the Breakup of the Soviet Union] by [[Roman Szporluk]], [[Hoover Institution Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|0817995420}} (page 355)&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Ukraine between 1991 and 2004 was marked by the presidencies of [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and [[Leonid Kuchma]]. This was a time of transition for Ukraine. While it had attained nominal independence from Russia, its presidents maintained close ties with their neighbours.

On June 1, 1996, Ukraine became a non-nuclear nation when it sent the last of its 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads it had inherited from the Soviet Union to Russia for dismantling.;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0773520872 Power versus Prudence: Why Nations Forgo Nuclear Weapons] by [[T.

The country adopted its [[Constitution of Ukraine|constitution]] on June 28, 1996.

The [[Cassette Scandal]] of 2000 was one of the turning points in post-independence history of the country.

===Orange Revolution (2004)===
[[File:Joesjtsjenko Marion Kiev 2004.jpg|thumb|Protesters at [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Independence Square]] on the first day of the Orange Revolution.]]
{{main|Orange Revolution}}
In 2004, Leonid Kuchma announced that he would not run for re-election. Two major candidates emerged in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. [[Viktor Yanukovych]], the incumbent Prime Minister, supported by both Kuchma and by the Russian Federation, wanted closer ties with Russia. The main opposition candidate, [[Viktor Yushchenko]], called for Ukraine to turn its attention westward and eventually join the EU.

In the runoff election, Yanukovych officially won by a narrow margin, but Yushchenko and his supporters cried foul, alleging that vote rigging and intimidation cost him many votes, especially in eastern Ukraine. A political crisis erupted after the opposition started massive street [[Orange Revolution|protests in Kiev and other cities]], and the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]] ordered the election results null and void. A second runoff found [[Viktor Yushchenko]] the winner. Five days later, [[Viktor Yanukovych]] resigned from office and his cabinet was dismissed on January 5, 2005.

===Yushchenko rule===
[[File:Viktor Yushchenko 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Yushchenko at the University of Amsterdam, with [[chloracne]] from [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]] [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] poisoning (2006).]]
In March 2006, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|elections]] took place and three months later the official government was formed by the "[[Anti-Crisis Coalition]]" among the ''[[Party of Regions]]'', ''[[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communist]]'', and ''[[Socialist Party of Ukraine|Socialist]]'' parties. The latter party switched from the "Orange Coalition" with ''[[Our Ukraine Bloc/Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]]'', and the ''[[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]]''. [[File:Yulia Tymoshenko 2011.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|[[Yulia Tymoshenko]]]]The new coalition nominated Viktor Yanukovych for the post of Prime Minister. Yanukovych once again became Prime Minister, while the leader of the Socialist Party, [[Oleksander Moroz]], managed to secure the position of chairman of parliament, which is believed by many to have been the reason for his leaving the Orange Coalition, where he had not been considered for this position.

On April 2, 2007, President Yushchenko dissolved the Verkhovna Rada because members of his party were defecting to the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lee Myers Published: May 31, 2007, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/31/america/kiev.php Confusion, chaos and comedy in Ukrainian politics] International Herald Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; His opponents called the move unconstitutional. When they took the matter to the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine|Constitutional Court]], Yushchenko dismissed 3 of the court's 18 judges, accusing them of corruption.

During the Yushchenko term, relations between Russia and Ukraine often appeared strained as Yushchenko looked towards improved relations with the European Union and less toward Russia. In 2005, a highly publicized [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute|dispute over natural gas prices]] took place, involving Russian state-owned gas supplier Gazprom, and indirectly involving many European countries which depend on natural gas supplied by Russia through the Ukrainian pipeline. A compromise was reached in January 2006, and in early 2010 a further agreement was signed locking the price of Russian gas at $100 per 1,000 cubic meters in an exclusive arrangement.

By the time of the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|presidential election of 2010]], Yushchenko and Tymoshenko — allies during the Orange Revolution — had become bitter enemies. Tymoshenko ran for president against both Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych, creating a three-way race. Yushchenko, whose popularity had plummeted, refused to close ranks and support Tymoshenko, thus dividing the anti-Yanukovych vote. Many pro-Orange voters stayed home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1963613,00.html Ukraine's New President: Is the Orange Revolution Over?], [[Time.com]] (11 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Yanukovych received 48% of the vote and Yushchenko less than 6%, an amount which, if thrown to Tymoshenko, who received 45%, would have prevented Yanukovych from gaining the presidency; since no candidate obtained an absolute majority in the first round of voting the two highest polling candidates contested in a run-off second ballot which Yanukovych won.

Following the violence, the Parliament turned against Yanukovych and on February 22 voted to remove him from power, and to free Yulia Tymoshenko from prison.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6724">The '''Modistae''' ([[Latin]] for "'''Modists'''"), also known as the '''speculative grammarians''', were the members of a school of [[grammar]]ian philosophy known as '''Modism''' or '''speculative grammar''', active in northern [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], and [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. Their influence was felt much less in the southern part of Europe, where the somewhat opposing tradition of the so-called "pedagogical grammar" never lost its preponderance.

==History&lt;!--'Ralph of Beauvais', 'Speculative grammarians', and 'Thomas of Erfurt' redirect here--&gt;==
[[William of Conches]], [[Peter Helias]], and '''Ralph of Beauvais'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, also referred to as '''speculative grammarians'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; predate the Modist movement proper.

The Modist philosophy was first developed by [[Martin of Dacia]] (died 1304)  and his colleagues in the mid-13th century, though it would rise to prominence only after its systematization by '''Thomas of Erfurt'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; decades later, in his treatise ''De modis significandi seu grammatica speculativa'', probably written in the first decade of the 14th century. Until the early twentieth-century this work was assumed to have been authored by [[John Duns Scotus]]. Widely reproduced and commented upon in the [[Middle Ages]], it remains the most complete textbook of Modist speculative grammar. The mistaken authorship arose out of the natural affinity of Erfurt's speculative grammar with Scotus's metaphysics.

==Theory of modes==
The philosophy of the Modistae, as indicated by their name, was based on a theory of 'modes' of meaning in language which was tripartite: modes of being (''modi essendi''), modes of understanding (''modi intelligendi''), and modes of signifying (''modi significandi''). To the Modistae, the various [[parts of speech]] were viewed as representing [[reality]] in terms of these modes. The ''modi essendi'' are objectively existent qualities in an object of understanding, the ''modi intelligendi'' the understanding's means of representing the ''modi essendi'', and the ''modi significandi'' grammar's means of representing the ''modi intelligendi'' in language. This corresponds to Aristotle's tripartite semantic theory of ''words'' representing ''concepts'' which represent ''objects''.

Opposing [[nominalism]], they assumed  that the analysis of the [[grammar]] of ordinary language was the key to [[metaphysics]]. For the Modistae, grammatical forms, the ''modi significandi'' of  verbs, nouns, and adjectives, comprise the deep [[ontological]] structure of language, which objectively reflects reality. Their work predicted the concept of [[universal grammar]], suggesting that universal grammatical rules may be extracted from all living languages. [[Roger Bacon]] may have given the movement inspiration with his observation that all languages are built upon a common grammar, a shared foundation of ontologically anchored linguistic structures. He argued grammar is substantially the same in all languages, even though it may undergo accidental variations between languages.

==Influences==
There are parallels between speculative grammar and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], a fact that was picked up early on by [[Martin Heidegger]], who wrote his first book, ''Die Kategorien-und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus'', on Thomas of Erfurt's treatise (at that time still mistakenly attributed to Duns Scotus).

The museum is housed in the 17th century [[Magna Curia Palace]], constructed in 1621 under the authority of Prince (Voivode) [[Gabor Bethlen]].  Under Bethlen's rule, Deva was the capital of [[Transylvania]], for a brief period.  The palace is located at the foot of the citadel hill next to a small park.

In a separate building next to the palace is the Natural History Museum (Muzeul Stintale Naturii).  The Art Gallery branch of the museum (Sectia de Arta) is located in the opposite prefecture, on the other side of the park and on the corner of Str. 1 Decembrie and Str. Avram Iancu.

'''Pat's Uninteresting Tours''' was a series of [[theme routes|themed route]] bus tours that offered an alternative to the usual sightseeing tours. Taking passengers on a four-hour comedy excursion to downmarket locations it operated in [[Sydney]], Australia during the mid to late 1980s.

The premise was to conduct paying passengers on a bus and expose them to ordinary situations in incongruous contexts - actively avoiding normal tourist attractions and visiting uninteresting sites. These included [[wine tasting]] at a [[rubbish tip]], "experiencing fresh air" at the [[sewage works]] and formal dinner at a road-side [[diner]]. Passengers were encouraged to dress in tourist garb for the day tours and tacky evening wear for night tours.&lt;ref&gt;Mandy Nash, "Moving theatre tours the eyesores" [[The Eastern Herald]] 12 November 1987&lt;/ref&gt; After [[TV New Zealand]] program ''[[That's Fairly Interesting]]'' recorded a segment, tours were conducted in [[Wellington]], [[Christchurch]], [[Palmerston North]] and later [[Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Evening Standard]], Palmerston North 25 July 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Communicado: Pat's Uninteresting Tours", ''That's Fairly Interesting'' presented by Neil Roberts [[TVNZ]] July 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
Patrick McGeown created the concept in 1978 whilst serving on board the [[Royal Australian Navy]] warship [[HMAS Perth (D 38)|HMAS ''Perth'']].&lt;ref&gt;Ken Davidson "Bored to Laughter" [[Australasian Post]] 22 July 1982&lt;/ref&gt; After repeated trips to [[Hawaii]], he began to lead alternative sightseeing events for other crewmates. Following the inaugural tour he then conducted tours in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and [[Canberra]] before launching the concept as a business in Sydney on 17 March 1985.&lt;ref&gt;David Conley "Tips are tops" [[Australasian Post]] 2 October 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destinations==
Each tour was unique and the four hours of improvisation and creativity took passengers to an assortment of locations.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Andrews "Tours host vows to bore 'em", [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] 4 March 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Conley "Oh, so bored - that's what you get when you go touring with Patrick" [[Gold Coast Bulletin]] 12 July 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Sydney locations were:

The '''Pisa Griffin''' is a large bronze sculpture of a [[griffin]], a mythical beast, which has been in [[Pisa]] in Italy since the Middle Ages, though it is of [[Islamic art|Islamic]] origin.  It is the largest medieval Islamic metal sculpture known, at over three feet tall (42.5&amp;nbsp;inches, or 1.07 m.), and was probably created in the 11th century in [[Al-Andalus]] (Islamic Spain).&lt;ref&gt;Quantara; Hoffman, 318&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been described as the "most famous as well as the most beautiful and monumental example" of a tradition of zoomorphic bronzes in Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;Yale, 210&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Cathedral Museum), Pisa.

==Description==
The griffin has the head of an [[eagle]]; but it has ears like those of a [[horse]] as well as the [[wattle (anatomy)|wattles]] of a [[rooster]], wings, and the body of a lion, or other mammal(s), with toes. Its dimensions are: height 107&amp;nbsp;cm; length 87&amp;nbsp;cm; width 43&amp;nbsp;cm. It is made of [[casting|cast]] bronze (i.e. [[copper alloy]]) with the wings cast separately and held in place by [[rivet]]s; it is largely hollow inside. There is an engraved decoration, including an Arabic inscription in [[Kufic script|Kufic]] letters round the beast's chest and flanks saying: "Perfect benediction, complete wellbeing, perfect joy, eternal peace and perfect health, and happiness and good fortune (?) for the owner".&lt;ref&gt;Quantara&lt;/ref&gt;  The wings are decorated with stylized [[feathers]], the chest with overlapping semi-circular [[Scale (anatomy)|scales]], and the back with a pattern of plain circles enclosed in two rings, on a textured background.  At the top of each leg there is a more elaborate, inverted teardrop-shaped zone or [[cartouche]], where [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]s surround an animal, lions on each front leg and birds, presumably eagles, on each rear one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_superzoom.php?im_id=3525 Quantara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326172753/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_superzoom.php?im_id=3525 |date=2012-03-26 }}, moveable zoom, close-up image], see Quantara text also.&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are three openings to the interior of the statue, which contains fittings given various interpretations, described below. There are openings at the mouth, rear – perhaps for a missing tail – and a larger one under the belly. Inside is "a globular “cup” made of bronze, open towards the belly and soldered on the back with a fine piece of the same metal".&lt;ref&gt;Quantara&lt;/ref&gt;

The griffin is the largest of a group of surviving Islamic bronze animals, most of which are much smaller and functioned as [[aquamanile]]s, [[Censer|incense-burners]] and the like, and whose origin goes back to pre-Islamic [[Sassanian]] vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Yale, 66, 210&lt;/ref&gt; A much smaller group of middle-sized works contains several that were clearly fountainheads, probably originally arranged in circular groups facing outwards, in the manner of the famous stone lions still in place at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]].&lt;ref&gt;"Christie's hind"; Spain, 80-84&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the group of non-portable early Islamic bronze animals, two have been sold in recent years, both clearly made as fountainheads: a lion, perhaps from [[Sicily]] and rather later in date, was sold for £1,546,650 at [[Sotheby's]] in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=3VJ2R A bronze fountainhead in the form of a lion, Mediterranean, probably South Italy, second half 12th century], Sotheby's lot description, Sale: L02221, London, Session 1: Wed, 16 Oct 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and a 10th-century hind (female deer) from Cordoba, which realized £3,631,500 in 1997 at [[Christie's]].&lt;ref&gt;"Christie's hind"; the one now (?) in the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]], [[Qatar]], see Cordoba Stag below&lt;/ref&gt;  This latter is said to be a companion of the "Cordoba Stag", the best known of the group after the Pisa Griffin, which is now 61.6&amp;nbsp;cm high, though lacking the [[antler]]s it is presumed to have originally had, and dates to ca. 950–1000.  It is in the Museo Arqueológico Provincial de Cordoba, and was found in the ruins of the large palace-city [[Madinat Al-Zahra]] outside Cordoba.&lt;ref&gt;Cordoba Stag: Jones and Mitchell, 167, cat. 172;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=209 "Spout of a fountain in the form of a stag"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326172742/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=209 |date=2012-03-26 }}, Quantara; [http://www.learn.columbia.edu/ma/htm/dj_islam/ma_dj_image_rel_obj03.htm Image of the Cordoba Stag]&lt;/ref&gt; Another, not matching, hind fountainhead from Madinat Al-Zahra is in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]] in Madrid (right); the 16th century historian [[Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari|al-Maqqari]] mentions "...marble basins with elaborate spouts at the palace of Madinat al-Zahra'. One of these was surrounded by twelve gold animal sculptures which spewed water from their mouths".&lt;ref&gt;"Christie's hind"&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller pieces are the "Kassel Lion" signed by Abd Allah Mattial from the 10th or 11th century ([[Kassel]] Museum),&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Mitchell, 165, cat. 168&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Monzon lion" in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=1037&amp;lang=en Lion with an articulated tail], the "Monzon Lion" on Quantara&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the griffin too might have been placed in a fountain, with water spouting from its mouth, but a more recent theory, based on the remains of its internal features, is that both it and a smaller lion in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, were in fact designed to emit noises from their mouth, as a kind of mechanical toy of a sort known to have been enjoyed in Islamic courts.&lt;ref&gt;Quantara; A. Contadini, R. Camber, P. Northover, ''Beasts that Roared: The Pisa Griffin and the New York Lion'' (not seen) sets out this theory&lt;/ref&gt;

Locating the area where the griffin was made has been the subject of considerable dedate, with Al-Andalus, Egypt, Sicily, North Africa and other places suggested at various points. Debate focuses on a group of bronzes of one sort or another that are often thought to have been made in the same area. Al-Andalus remains the most popular choice, but South Italy or Sicily are possible, though Egypt seems to have largely fallen out of contention.&lt;ref&gt;Quantara; [http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1879640 "A SPANISH ISLAMIC DOOR KNOCKER, 11TH CENTURY"] Christie's Lot description and notes. Sale 6373, ISLAMIC ART AND MANUSCRIPTS, 10 October 2000
London, King Street; see also "Christie's hind".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Hillenbrand]] suggests that the fantastic nature of the griffin and other statues of animals was influenced by a belief that such mythical beasts were less likely to be regarded as idolatrous than lifelike animal forms.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand&lt;/ref&gt; All representations of animals were [[aniconism in Islam|against strict interpretations of Islam]], and three-dimensional ones, especially when large, were especially likely to be accused of skirting [[idolatry]], and are rare in [[Islamic art]]. An aquamanile in the [[Hermitage Museum]] of a cow and calf attacked by a lion has later had the throats of the animals cut with a sharp groove, apparently to make it clear that they are dead.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Mitchell, 169, cat 178; [https://books.google.com/books?id=EuxsKUAY0qAC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Aquamanile&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OvHTTY6sO4fOswaqm-TkAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Aquamanile&amp;f=false full account here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oleg Grabar]] suggests that the engraved decoration may be "translations into cheaper bronze" of inlays and enamelling found on gold and silver Byzantine objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oleg Grabar|Grabar, Oleg]] ''Early Islamic art, 650-1100, Volume 1 Constructing the study of Islamic art'', p. 238, Ashgate/Variorum, 2005, {{ISBN|0-86078-921-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-86078-921-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The circular patterns on the griffin's back and several of the other works mentioned above derive from textile designs.&lt;ref&gt;"Christie's hind"&lt;/ref&gt;

The griffin is generally agreed to have arrived in Pisa at some point during the late 11th or early 12th century, and may have been a spoil of one of the many successful "wars" or raids conducted by the [[Republic of Pisa]] against Islamic states at this period, when the small city was at the height of its power as a [[maritime republic]]. The successful attack in 1087 on [[Mahdia]] in modern [[Tunisia]], capital of the local [[Zirid dynasty]] is one candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Yale, 210.  Other possibilities are the [[Pisan–Genoese expeditions to Sardinia (1015–1016)]] and [[1113–1115 Balearic Islands expedition]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The griffin was placed on a platform on top of a column rising from the [[gable]] above the [[apse]] at the east end of [[Pisa Cathedral]], probably as part of the original construction, which was begun in 1064.  This was a very prominent position, but one that meant that it could not be seen close up, and its Islamic origins were forgotten over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  According to later local legends it was variously said to be Roman, a local medieval creation, a spoil of war [[1113–1115 Balearic Islands expedition|from 1115]], or miraculously found when the foundations of the cathedral were being excavated.&lt;ref&gt;Quantara; Mack, 181–182, note 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Large-scale  European bronze casting at this period specialized in fonts and pairs of doors, of which there is a fine Romanesque pair with [[relief]]s in the same museum.

In 1828 the griffin was removed and placed in the Cathedral Museum, with a replica later placed in the original position.  Once seen closely, the [[Kufic]] inscription made its Islamic origins plain, although [[John Murray (publisher)|Murray's Handbook]] for Italy in 1861 fantasized that: "Though Arabian, it is as clearly not Mahometan, and it is most probably an idol or a talisman belonging to the Druzes, or some other of the tribes who even still secretly reject the doctrines of the Koran".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ymwDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Pisa+griffon&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jMnRTaXpIYbKswaOn-iXCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pisa%20griffon&amp;f=false ''Handbook for travellers in central Italy''], by O. Blewitt, p. 49, 1861, John Murray&lt;/ref&gt;  Debate about the place and date of its creation continues to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Quantara, and see above.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pisa the griffin joined other trophy pieces of prestigious bronze sculpture displayed at the heart of the civic space, like (later) the [[Horses of St Mark]] and the lion on a column in the [[Piazza San Marco|Piazzetta]] in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; In Pisa it forms a part of probably the most famous ensemble of [[Romanesque architecture]] in Italy in the ''[[Piazza dei Miracoli]]'', looking at the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]], with the [[Baptistry (Pisa)|Bapistry]] behind it.  

In recent years the griffin has travelled to exhibitions in [[Berlin]] in 1989, Granada, New York in 1992, and Brigham Young University in Provo in 2012.  

There is an ongoing interdisciplinary project on the Pisa Griffin and related metalwork and material culture, in collaboration with Oxford University, Pisa University, [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]]-[[Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione|ISTI]] in Pisa, Opera della Primaziale Pisana, and the [[Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/griffin/ The Pisa Griffin Project]&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the outcomes of the project there will be an accurate digital 3D model of the statue obtained through [[3D scanning]], videos, a book and an exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staff30791.php Dr Anna Contadini], [[SOAS]], London&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pleurants''' or '''weepers''' (the English meaning of ''pleurants'') are anonymous sculpted figures representing [[mourner|mourners]], used to decorate elaborate [[tomb monument]]s, mostly in the late Middle Ages in Western Europe.  Typically they are relatively small, and a group were placed around the sides of a raised tomb monument, perhaps interspersed with armorial decoration, or carrying shields with this.  They may be in [[relief]] or free-standing.  In English usage the term "weepers" is sometimes extended to cover the small figures of the deceased's children often seen kneeling underneath the [[tomb effigy]] in Tudor tomb monuments. 

These figures represent the mourners, who pray for the deceased standing during the funeral procession.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Because many of the original tombs have been vandalised or destroyed, relatively few examples remain to be studied. Many figures have been detached from their original context, which is not always known.

In the 16th and 17th century the practice of placing anonymous pleurant figures disappeared, although the group at Brou for [[Margaret of Bourbon (1438–1483)|Margaret of Bourbon]] were not begun until 1526 at the earliest.  But these were commissioned over 40 years after her death by her daughter, along with tombs for herself and her husband, and reflected the taste of Margaret's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Burk, Jens Ludwig, "Conrat Meit, Margaret of Austria's Court Sculptor in Malines and Brou", Centre des monuments nationaux (France) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
The type began in England in the 13th century, inspired by French examples. The first examples had relief figures set within quatrefoil frames, as in the tomb now used for [[Henry Marshal (bishop of Exeter)|Henry Marshal, Bishop of Exeter]] (d. 1206) in [[Exeter Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 146. The tomb now carries his effigy, but dates to the second half of the century&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded use of the English word is in a contract relating to the construction of the very grand tomb of [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick]], who died in 1437 in France, though the contract is some time later, and the weepers were made in 1452–53. This has the effigy and weepers in [[gilt-bronze]], and still stands in the [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick]], with the "xiv images embossed of lords and ladyes in divers verstures, called weepers", standing in niches around the sides, that were specified.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 207–209; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aKJbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10 the contract]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Franco-Burgundian examples ==
On the Continent they are especially a feature of the tombs of Franco-Burgundian royalty, imitated by some grand nobles.  The tomb at [[Royaumont Abbey]] of [[Louis of France (1244–1260)]], son of [[Louis IX of France]], appears to have popularized the type.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Here a side of the chest below the effigy shows eight walking figures in relief in an arcade, led by two mitred clerics.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Louiss1260.jpg|image]]&lt;/ref&gt; One end of the chest had a relief of the dead prince, covered by a cloth that leaves his face exposed being carried by four bearers.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Cortège des funérailles de Louis de France (1260).jpg|Image, now musée Carnavalet]]. Rather bizarrely, after the Revolution this panel was re-used for the "grave" of [[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] and [[Héloïse]] at [[Père Lachaise]] cemetery.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8199">'''Polar wander''' is the motion of a pole in relation to a fixed reference frame. It can be used, for example, to measure the degree to which Earth's magnetic poles have been observed to move relative to the Earth's rotation axis. It is also possible to use [[continents]] as a static entity and observe the relative motion of the [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic pole]] on the different continents; by doing so, the relative motion of those two continents to each other can be observed over [[geologic time]].&lt;ref name ="Kearey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Philip |first1=Kearey |first2=Keith A. |last2=Klepeis |first3=Frederick J. |last3=Vine|title=Global tectonics.|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=9781405107778|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apparent polar wander==
{{main|Apparent polar wander}}
The [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic poles]] are relatively stationary in position over time and because of this, researchers often use [[Magnetic mineralogy|magnetic minerals]], like [[magnetite]], in order to find at what latitude the continent was positioned relative to the magnetic poles of that time. Since the continents have been moving relative to the pole; it is as if they were immobile and the magnetic pole was moving instead. If enough data is collected, it is then possible to reconstruct the motion of the continents relative to the magnetic poles. The apparent polar wander is the path that the magnetic pole appears to take according to the data on a continent. When multiple continents are moving relative to each other, the path their magnetic pole will follow will be different from the others.&lt;ref name="Kearey" /&gt; Conversely, when two continents are moving parallel to each other their path will be the same.

==True polar wander==
{{main|True polar wander}}

===Earth===
True polar wander represents the shift in the geographical poles relative to Earth’s surface, after accounting for the motion of the tectonic plates. This motion is caused by the rearrangement of the mantle and the crust in order to align the [[Polhode|maximum inertia]] with the current rotation axis &lt;ref name="Evans1"&gt;{{Cite journal

This is similar to a spinning top; when its rotation is disturbed, it slowly recovers and it will realign its rotation axis to its position of maximum inertia. The difference is that unlike Earth, the spinning top’s mass distribution is constant through its volume over time. Evidence for true polar wander has been observed from the study of large apparent polar wander datasets which, when corrected for the motion of the magnetic pole,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Modern polar wander can be evaluated from precise measurement using stars or satellite measurements, however filtering to remove the wobble of the Earth is required. The formation of [[supercontinents]] could initiate a faster polar wander. That is, because the supercontinent creates an extra mass concentration where they are located, the planet tries to re-orient the supercontinent towards the equator.&lt;ref name="Evans1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Other planetary bodies===
True polar wander may have been observed in other planetary bodies. Data suggests that Mars’s polar wander resembles Earth’s true polar wander; that is, when Mars had an active lithosphere its structure allowed slow polar drift to stabilize the [[moment of inertia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Unlike the Earth and Mars, [[Venus]]’s structure does not seem to allow the same slow polar wander; when observed the maximum moment of inertia of Venus is largely offset from the geographic pole. Therefore, the deviation of the maximum moment of inertia will remain for longer periods of time. One proposed solution to account for this imbalance is that if the difference between the maximum moment of inertia and rotation axis exceeds a certain limit, the planet will undergo a larger degree of oscillation to realign its maximum of inertia with its rotation axis. If this is indeed the case, then the timescale at which this correction happens must be fairly short.&lt;ref name="Spada1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Europa (moon)|Europa]], a moon of [[Jupiter]], has been modelled to have a crust that is decoupled from its mantle; that is, the outer icy crust may be floating on a covered ocean. If this is true, then models predict that the shell could display the polar wander trace on its surface as its crust realigns. These models have been defended by evidence from features on the side facing away from Jupiter that appear to have shifted up to 80° away from their initial positions of formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5799">'''Rich Donovan''' is a global expert in business development issues surrounding disability and accessibility. He is best known for creating financial instruments that track the intersection of corporate profitability with corporate commitment to disability hiring and best practices. His Return On Disability Index is reported on Bloomberg and has been used as the basis of an Exchange Traded Note (ETN) by [[Barclay’s Bank]] on the [[NYSE Arca]] Stock Exchange.

==Accessibility and Finance Work==

===Development of the Return on Disability Index===

Rich Donovan is a founder of several research and advisory companies that have foregrounded the business case for companies and governments to act on the disability market. In 2008, he founded what is now called '''The Return on Disability Group''' to build metric and models that allow for analysis of corporate activity which help assess how well businesses engage customers and employees with disabilities. The organization’s "Return on Disability Reports" and other models helps companies understand their performance across disability factors that are linked directly to profitability. As well they produce the Return on Disability Indices for the U.S. and Canada markets. These financial tools "recognize public companies that are outperforming in the disability market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rod-group.com/rod-report/companies |title=The RoD Report |publisher=The Return on Disability Group |access-date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RoD US 100 and the RoD Canada 50, are published daily by Bloomberg LP. The indices track the shares of the 100 firms that deal best with disabled people. The Economist notes that in the five years to 2012 the US index had outperformed the broader stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=September 8, 2012|title=Disability and business: The new green |publisher=[[The Economist]] |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LIME===
In 2006, Rich Donovan founded Lime Connect.   Lime Connect is an organization whose goal is to find employment for people with disabilities.   The idea with Lime Connect is: “to connect with the brightest people with disabilities from all disciplines. Results have been stellar, with the Lime Connect Fellowship Program placing 20 young stars in 2011 alone, six of whom were hired by Google.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essentialaccessibility.com/newsletter/march/feature.html |title=Disability: From Redheaded Stepchild to Golden Girl |publisher=Essential Accessibility |first1=Rich|last1=Donovan|access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies Lime has partnered with include PepsiCo, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, IBM, and TD Bank.&lt;ref name =Carleton&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=2014 |title=Rich Donovan |work=Accessibility Summit: Speaker List |publisher=[[Carleton University]] |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamental Concepts===

As one of the early progenitors of the business case for accessibility, Donovan has focused on the following:

* Strategic road maps for companies to do accessibility well. What works within their strategic frameworks.
* What accessibility practices drive value at specific companies that, in turn, drive investor returns
* the notion of Shared value so that the next ten years of growth will come from non-traditional markets such as people with disabilities

==Personal Life and Professional Development==

===Education===

Donovan received his BBA in Finance from the Schulich School of Business at York University (1993 - 1997) and his MBA from Columbia Business School (2000 – 2002). He worked successfully as a trader for Merrill Lynch. Donovan is an avid sailor and father of a son, Maverick, along with his wife, Jenn. He has cerebral palsy.&lt;ref name=Carleton/&gt;

The '''Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve''' is 5,250&amp;nbsp;km² of preserved land in the [[La Mosquitia]] region on the Caribbean coast of [[Honduras]]. Most of the land runs along the [[Plátano River|Río Plátano]]. The reserve has a number of endangered species and some of Honduras largest sections of forest. It has been a World Heritage site and biosphere reserve since 1982. In 2011, UNESCO placed the reserve on the List of World Heritage in Danger.&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/196&lt;/ref&gt;

The reserve encompasses both mountainous and lowland [[tropical rainforest]], full of diverse wildlife and plant life, and has more than 2000 inhabitants. The reserve is part of the [[Mesoamerican Biological Corridor]] that stretches from Mexico southwards through Central America.

Although the reserve covers a large portion of Honduras, very little is recorded about the biological diversity within it. While previous management plans have proven successful, a continued investigation into ongoing management plans and future conservation issues will be necessary to keep this valuable reserve safe. Currently there are threats to the conservation of the reserve which include illegal hunting, logging and clearing of land to graze cattle. Recent rafting expeditions from the Rio Plátano headwaters through all three zones of the reserve (cultural, buffer and core) have documented cattle grazing in the core zone, commercial fishing and hunting camps along the river and clear cutting of forest near Las Marias.

==History==
In 1960, the land was set aside as the "Cuidad Blanca Archaeological Reserve," named after the rumored ancient settlement known as ''[[la Ciudad Blanca]].'' The reserve was renamed "Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve" in 1980 and added to the World Heritage list in 1982.&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;{{cite journal|title=The El Dorado Machine|author=Douglas Preston|date=May 6, 2013|journal=The New Yorker|pages=34–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A management and development was designed in 1980 and implemented in 1987 by the Department of Natural Renewable Resources. In 1997, an additional 3250&amp;nbsp;km² was designated as a buffer zone for the reserve. In 1997, the [[German Development Bank]] began a plan that would significantly expand the reserve to the Patuca River and the Bosawas Biosphere Reserve in Nicaragua. Currently, the German plan has been delayed.&lt;ref name="WCMC"&gt;{{cite web

===Archeological sites===
The reserve still has over 200 archeological sites,&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = UNESCO-MAB
  | title = Biosphere Reserve Information

  | first = Jens
  | last = Yde
  | title = Review: [untitled]
  | journal = American Antiquity
  | volume = 23:2
  | pages = 196
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few of these sites are protected, in fact some have been looted and many are a significant factor for tourism. Although the archeological value of the region initially played a large part in the formation of the reservation, the reservation currently focuses mostly on the protection of the forests.&lt;ref name="EOE"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition, ''[[La Ciudad Blanca]]'' is located in the region.  Over the years, many professional and amateur archeologists have claimed to find it, but none have produced credible evidence and most professionals remain skeptical that it ever existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Francie Diep|title=How Lasers Helped Discover Lost Honduras City|url=http://www.innovationnewsdaily.com/1240-lasers-helped-discover-lost-honduras-city.html|work=Innovation News Daily|date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local population==
The reserve is home for more than 2,000 indigenous people and a growing number of migrant inhabitants.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt; The population includes four very different and unique cultural groups: [[Miskito people|Miskito]], [[Pech people|Pech]], [[Garifunas]], and the [[ladino people|ladino]]. The smaller groups, the Pech, Garifunas, and Miskito inhabitants live mostly in the north, alongside the river. These people have a variety of rights to the land and mostly use the land for agriculture.&lt;ref name="WCMC" /&gt; The smaller-scale agriculture of the Pech is easily made sustainable. Many of the largest group, the ladino, entered the reserve from the south.&lt;ref name="WCMC" /&gt; Conflict over land rights is a prominent source of conflict between ethnic groups. Current conflict over land rights involves non native peoples invading and threatening indigenous land owners—forcing them from their historical lands.

==Conservation==
In 1996 the reserve received the [[World Heritage in Danger]] designation. A reserve management plan, implemented in 2000, included macrozoning, subzoning, and specific plans for conservation issues.&lt;ref name="dec2006"&gt;
{{cite web

  | url=http://whc.unesco.org/download.cfm?id_document=9013
  | accessdate = 2008-04-01 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The macrozoning plan established buffer zones, cultural zones, and nucleus zones. The overall threat, especially in the nucleus zones, had decreased in 2006  recognizing a significant improvement in conservation efforts, leading to the removal of the World Heritage in Danger designation in 2007.&lt;ref name="dec2006" /&gt; From recent investigations in 2010 and 2011, however, it appears that what ever gains were initially recognized, that is not the case currently. UNESCO recently (2011) did a mission to the Rio Plátano and found illegal activity within the core zone. Drug smuggling, clearing of land for cattle grazing, and illegal fishing and hunting along the river are currently happening. In 2011, UNESCO placed the reserve on the List of World Heritage in Danger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/196 UNESCO World Heritage Site datasheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is protected by policy from the Department of Protected Areas &amp; Wildlife, State Forestry Administration in Honduras, and receives some funding from the World Wildlife Fund and other private organizations. A number of governmental and non-governmental organizations and committees have developed and implemented conservation plans in the region. The main goal of the reserve is to protect the land from deforestation and development.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;

The reserve’s conservation plan aims to integrate local inhabitants into their environment via sustainable agricultural practices (see [[La Ruta Moskitia Ecotourism Alliance]]). Indigenous populations play a large part into the success of the conservation plan, both inside the reservation and outside the reservation in the buffer zones. Assigning titles and recognizing de facto property rights played an important part of the beginning of the conservation plan in the reserve. There is currently a need to update any conservation plan for the reserve.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The conservation plan requests continued commitment to clarifying land ownership in and around the reserve. More research needs to be done to understand the value of the reserve and the potential threats it faces. There are currently no park guards or any official entity actively patrolling or guarding the reserve.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Climate==
The annual precipitation is between {{convert|2850|and|4000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, and the local inhabitants have noticed a trend towards dryer seasons.&lt;ref name="EOE" /&gt; The climate in the region is key to preserving the valuable wet forests and important for the agriculture upon which the indigenous people depend.

The reserve also receives an average of four severe [[tropical storm]]s every ten years.&lt;ref name="Herrera-MacBryde" /&gt; The tropical storms echo through the rest of the reserve through the numerous waterways. Development plans and agriculture depend upon the river’s natural levees to drain water from low-lying areas. The after-effects of the [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998 disrupted the development of the Patuca II hydroelectric facility.&lt;ref name="EOE" /&gt;

==Geography==
The land stretches from La Moskitia coast through lagoons and along the Río Plátano up into the mountains. The buffer area also includes the Paulaya and Sico valley, and will eventually extend to the [[Patuca River]]. The reserve is mostly mountainous, including Pico Dama, a giant granite formation, and Punta Piedra, the highest peak at {{convert|1326|m|abbr=on}}.

The reserve includes nearly the entire watershed of the Río Plátano, and many other smaller waterways. Much of the region is covered with mountainous terrain. The rivers wind through both the lower and mountainous regions. The forms many oxbows as it crosses the long stretch of flat lowland that separates the foothills from the lagoons. The river has created oxbow lakes, marshes, and natural levees.

The geography of the region makes agriculture and conservation especially complicated. The low-land areas covered with water throughout the winter, and the rivers and the various tributaries house a wide variety of flora. The coastal region to the north is more commonly documented, so the rest of the region needs more thorough exploration.

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:belize21.jpg|thumb|right|[[Baird's tapir]]]]
[[File:Bradypus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brown-throated sloth]]]]
The reserve contains part of the largest surviving area of undisturbed tropical rainforest in Honduras and one of the few remaining in Central America, with numerous endangered species.&lt;ref name="EOE" /&gt; Although there is a growing amount of research available on the biodiversity within the reserve, the current management plans emphasize the need for more research on the flora and fauna of the region.

===Flora===
The major ecosystems include [[mangrove]] and freshwater swamps and marshes, sedge prairie, pine savanna, and gallery forest. There is a diverse amount of flora, estimated at over 2,000 species of vascular plants,&lt;ref name="WCMC" /&gt; although little has been written about it because many species are new or undiscovered.&lt;ref name="Herrera-MacBryde"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:onça pintada.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jaguar]]]]
There are two major mangrove ecosystems along the coast: the Brus Lagoon and the Iban Lagoon. The Brus area is 120&amp;nbsp;km² and brackish, and the Ibans area is 63&amp;nbsp;km² and freshwater.&lt;ref name="Herrera-MacBryde"/&gt; The mangroves are valuable and fragile, so they are a significant part of the value of the reserve.
[[File:CMM MountainLion.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cougar|Puma]]]]
Further in, the land becomes prairie and savannah with pine and palm, depending upon the availability of water.  Along the watershed of the rivers, the vegetation is thick wet forest, which is again, poorly studied.&lt;ref name="WCMC" /&gt;
[[File:myresluger.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giant anteater]]]]

===Fauna===
The documented fauna of the region includes 39 species of mammals, 377 species of birds and 126 species of reptiles and amphibians.&lt;ref name="WCMC" /&gt; The region is rich with birds, including the [[king vulture]], [[harpy eagle]], [[great curassow]], [[crested guan]], [[scarlet macaw]], green macaw and [[military macaw]].
[[File:Collared peccary02 - melbourne zoo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Collared peccary]]]]
[[File:Allouataadulto 500px.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mantled howler]]]]
The representative species include [[white-headed capuchin]], [[mantled howler]] and [[spider monkeys]], [[brown-throated sloth]], [[paca]], [[kinkajou]], [[coati]]mundi tayra, Central American otter, [[Cougar|puma]], [[collared peccary]], [[white-lipped peccary]] and [[red brocket]].

===Rare and endangered species===
The rare or endangered species: [[giant anteater]], [[jaguar]], [[ocelot]], [[margay]], Caribbean [[West Indian manatee]], and Central American tapir.
The amount of environmental education that exists in Honduras is minimal, so it is difficult to protect these endangered species.&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = TAPIR SPECIALIST GROUP
  | title = Tapirs: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan
  | url=http://www.tapirback.com/tapirgal/iucn-ssc/tsg/action97/ap97-10.htm
  | accessdate = 2008-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread poverty and lack of accurate research on the ecosystems makes protection increasingly difficult. While the conservation programs are reaching their goals, it is difficult to tell whether or not the management plans are successfully protecting these species directly. Protecting the ecosystems, like the rainforest, upon which the endangered species depend serves as an important indirect benefit.

==Tourism==
The high density of wildlife along [[La Mosquitia]] coast makes it a popular destination for ecotourists. Although private organizations are launching ecotourism enterprises throughout the region,&lt;ref name="Motly fool"&gt;{{cite news
  | last = Crockett
  | first = Carrie
  | publisher = Motly Fool
  | title = Where are they now?
  | url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2007/07/24/where-are-they-now.aspx
  | accessdate = 2008-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the government does not have a comprehensive plan to control or benefit from ecotourists.&lt;ref name="EOE" /&gt; Ecotourism can offer relief for poverty stricken local populations, increased awareness of biological value, and can generate income that can be used to fund projects for the reserve. Currently there are guided 10- to 12-day rafting trips being offered down the entire length of the Rio Plátano.

Although a properly implemented tourist industry could benefit the reserve, the currently unregulated industry has created a large amount of traffic and damaged archeological sites.&lt;ref name="WCMC" /&gt; The tourism industry has an impact across the entire reserve, but the unprotected archeological sites are especially hurt. Without developing infrastructure, it is difficult to have a profitable and sustainable ecotourism industry, especially in a reserve with difficult conservation issues.

==Conservation issues==
Despite its removal from the World Heritage in Danger designation, the reserve still faces a few conservation threats. Logging and development continue to be problems, and the situation is exacerbated by an increasing population from poorer parts of Honduras or refugees from Nicaragua.

===Logging===
The government regulates the logging industry in Honduras through the Honduran Cooperation for Forestry Development.  Despite oversight of these and other organizations and a moratorium on logging inside the reserve, mahogany continues to be cut and removed.&lt;ref name="TED"&gt;
{{cite web
  | last = TED Case Studies
  | title = Honduras and Deforestation
  | url=http://www.american.edu/TED/honduras.htm
  | accessdate = 2008-04-01 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Honduran government has failed to pass laws strict enough to have a substantial impact on preventing deforestation. The entire reserve could quickly disappear, even through unregulated deforestation.

Local populations admit that a large amount mahogany is leaving the reserve, but many poorer sections of the economy see the high price of mahogany as enough incentive to clear away valuable ecosystems that provide irreplaceable services to the water and soil. The loggers behind much of the reserve’s deforestation is still mostly unknown.&lt;ref name="TED" /&gt;
===Development===
Development within and around the reserve poses a problem for the conservation plans. The construction of the Patuca II hydroelectric plant in the Patuca river highlights the elements of the debate. A hydroelectric plant does more than affect the waterway where it is built. It also requires infrastructure that disturbs the environment around it. A lot of the reserve does not have developed roadways or power. A hydroelectric facility would require development throughout the reserve.

Agriculture throughout the reserve poses a more direct threat. As the populations expand within the reserve, so do their agricultural operations. Much of the wetland area is unsuitable for agriculture, needing levees and continued development to be productive. Much of the non-legal de facto ownership has spurred conflict, sometimes violent, among different cultural groups over rights to agriculturally productive areas.&lt;ref name="EOE" /&gt;

Poorer farmers resort to destructive techniques, like slash-and-burn, that are particularly damaging to the savannah and prairie land.&lt;ref name="Youth"&gt;
{{cite book
  | last = Youth
  | first = Howard
  | title = Green awakening in a poor country
  | publisher = World Watch
  | date = September 1, 1998
  | location = Honduras }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Although the current management plan aims to educate farmers about these destructive practices, they continue. Future management goals aim to promote sustainable technique among a larger number of the traditional farmers.

===Refugees===
Poverty in Honduras and neighboring Nicaragua, and an increasing number of hurricanes have driven many refugees into the reserve,&lt;ref name="KRT"&gt;
{{cite news
  | last = Weinberg
  | first = Boll
  | title = Indigenous Peoples, Civil Society under Attack in Colombia's Oil Zone
  | publisher = Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News
  | date = October 15, 2003}}
&lt;/ref&gt; making conservation efforts increasingly complicated. These refugees often enter through the south of the reserve, and sometimes create more conflict integrating with the indigenous populations. While traditional farming practices can be somewhat destructive, the stress created by larger populations is much more damaging to the reserve.

Currently, the Honduran Corporation for Forestry Development with the help of the Honduran Public Safety Force polices the reserve,&lt;ref name="WCMC" /&gt; hoping to decrease the number of people who invade. Regardless of their efforts, refugees continue to enter. The reservation considered a plan to relocate refugees outside the reserve, creating both an increased buffer and reducing the stress within the reserve. This plan was met with political opposition.&lt;ref name="EOE" /&gt;

[[File:Maketa salaša u Kikindskom muzeju.jpg|thumb|Model of a salaš in the Kikinda Museum, Serbia]]
'''Salaš''' (in [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]], from [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''szállás'' meaning "house, accommodation"&lt;ref&gt;[http://hjp.srce.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&amp;id=dldnXxY%3D&amp;keyword=sala%C5%A1 Hrvatski jezični portal] Salaš &lt;/ref&gt;) is a traditional type of farm in the [[Pannonian Plain]] region, particularly in [[Bačka]] and [[Slavonija]]. A ''salaš'' is typically remote from a town or village. It consists of a family house, agricultural objects such as [[barn]], [[stable]] and [[granary]], surrounded by arable land and pastures.&lt;ref name="CollectifAuzias2012"&gt;{{citation|author1=Collectif|author2=Dominique Auzias|author3=Jean-Paul Labourdette|title=Serbie 2012-2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dnoDJ_b6Y_wC&amp;pg=PA172|date=15 March 2012|publisher=Petit Futé|isbn=2-7469-5324-2|pages=172–|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were owned and inhabited by a single family, who lived there for generations.

The once very numerous "mudhuts" on the plains of central Europe were built from locally found materials: the walls were raised from beaten mud, or mud-and-hay bricks dried in the sun. The roof was usually from dried reed, assembled together in traditional craftsmanship. Today, salaš becomes part of folklore to be shown to tourists, together with traditional foods and beverages, customs, farm life, [[tamburica]] music, etc.

In Slovak culture, ''salaše'' were remote encampments for sheep-guards, and eventually came to denote small countryside restaurants housed in such houses, providing sheep products and traditional home meals such as [[bryndzové halušky]]. &lt;ref name="DunfordAtkinson2007"&gt;{{citation|author1=Lisa Dunford|author2=Brett Atkinson|author3=Neil Wilson|title=Czech &amp; Slovak Republics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d-98VTp9UhMC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2007|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-300-6|pages=70–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shock Illustrated''''' was an American black and white magazine published by [[EC Comics]] from late 1955 to early 1956. Part of EC's [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The artists drew one to four panels per page with the text overlaid onto the artwork. The first issue appeared with a cover date of September–October 1955 and featured three psychology-themed stories, similar in theme to the comic ''Psychoanalysis'' published by EC in 1955. Starting with the second issue this type of story was generally reduced to one per issue, with the remaining stories being similar in theme to those that appeared in EC's comic ''[[Shock SuspenStories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Russ. ''Complete EC Library: Terror Illustrated''. Gemstone, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shock Illustrated'' ran for a total of three issues. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and when EC's distributor went bankrupt, the company had no choice but to cancel the prints. The third issue of this magazine is known as the rarest EC publication of all time. Although all 250,000 copies had been printed, publisher [[William Gaines|Bill Gaines]] lacked the funds to bind them, and all but 100 copies were destroyed.

==Contributors==
The editor of ''Shock Illustrated'' was [[Al Feldstein]]. In addition to those stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote under the pseudonym [[Alfred E. Neuman]]. Feldstein included multiple retellings of previous stories, a move suggested by Gaines. This included "A Question of Time" and "Dead Right" in the second issue and "Curiosity Killed" in the third issue. Contributing writers included [[Jack Oleck]] (who had worked as a writer on EC's earlier publications), Robert Bernstein, John Larner, and [[Daniel Keyes]] (using the pseudonyms Kris Daniels and A.D. Locke).

Artists featured in ''Shock Illustrated'' included [[Jack Kamen]], Rudy Nappi, [[Reed Crandall]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Al Williamson]], [[Angelo Torres]] and [[Graham Ingels]].

''Shock Illustrated'' was reprinted along with the other Picto-Fiction magazines in hardbound volumes by Russ Cochran (and [[Gemstone Publishing]]) for the first time in 2006 as the final part of his ''Complete EC Library''. With these reprints, published for the first time, was the fourth issue of the title which had been produced but never printed.

'''Stane Street''' is the modern name given to an important {{convert|90|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} [[Roman road]] in [[England]] that linked [[London]] to the Roman town of [[Noviomagus Reginorum]], or ''Regnentium'', later renamed [[Chichester]] by the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chichester.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1858 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016205542/http://www.chichester.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1858 |archivedate=2007-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vincent&gt;{{cite book | last= Vincent | first = Alex | title = Roman Roads of Sussex  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g0-TPQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Roman+Roads+of+Sussex+Vincent | publisher = Middleton Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-901706-48-6 |page= 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of construction is uncertain; however on the basis of archaeological artefacts discovered along the road, it was in use by 70&amp;nbsp;AD&lt;ref name=Winbolt&gt;{{cite book |title=With a Spade on Stane Street |last= Winbolt |first= SE |year=1936 |publisher=Methuen |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may have been constructed in the first decade of the [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation of Britain]] (as early as 43-53&amp;nbsp;AD).&lt;ref name=Margary/&gt;

Stane Street shows clearly the engineering principles that the Romans used when building roads. A straight line alignment from [[London Bridge]] to Chichester would have required steep crossings of the [[North Downs]], [[Greensand Ridge]] and [[South Downs]] and so the road was designed to exploit a natural gap in the North Downs cut by the [[River Mole]] and to pass to the east of the high ground of [[Leith Hill]] before following flatter land in the [[River Arun]] valley to [[Pulborough]].  The direct survey line was followed only for the northernmost {{convert|12.5|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} from London to [[Ewell]].&lt;ref name=Margary/&gt; At no point does the road lie more than six miles from the direct line from London Bridge to Chichester.

Today the Roman road is easily traceable on modern maps. Much of the route is followed by the [[A3 road|A3]], [[A24 road (England)|A24]], [[A29 road|A29]] and A285, although most of the course through the modern [[Surrey|county of Surrey]] has either been completely abandoned or is followed only by [[Bridle path|bridlepaths]].&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hall A |year= 2008 |title= The archaeological evidence for the route of Stane Street from Mickleham Downs to London Road, Ewell |journal= Surrey Archaeological Collections |publisher= Surrey Archaeological Society |volume= 94 |pages= 225–250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earthworks associated with the road are visible in many places where the course is not overlain by modern roads and the well-preserved section from Mickleham Downs to Thirty Acres Barn, [[Ashtead]] is listed as a [[scheduled monument]].&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;

==Etymology==
Stane is simply an old spelling of "stone" ({{lang-on|steinn}}) which was commonly used to differentiate paved [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman]] roads from muddy native trackways. The name of the road is first recorded as ''Stanstret'' in both the 1270 [[Feet of Fines]] and the 1279 [[Assizes (England and Wales)|Assizes Rolls]] of [[Ockley]].&lt;ref name=Margary/&gt; It is also referred to by the modern spelling as '''Stone Street''' as far back as medieval sources. There is no surviving record of the road's original Roman name.

==Dating evidence==
A number of  first-century pottery fragments and coins have been found along the road, including [[Samian ware]] of [[Claudius|Claudian]] date at Pulborough. The earliest coins found are of Claudius (41–54 AD), with others of Nero, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian and Nerva (96-98 AD). This is consistent with the road being in use by 60 to 70 AD, possibly earlier. 
&lt;ref name=Margary/&gt;

==Surveying and construction==
[[File:Stane street map 3.png|thumb|203px|Map of Stane Street showing the four main limbs (red and blue) and linking sections (black).]]
The direct line from London Bridge to Chichester passes over the [[North Downs]] at [[Ranmore Common|Ranmore]] (200&amp;nbsp;m above [[Ordnance Datum]]), the [[Greensand Ridge]] at [[Holmbury St Mary]] (260&amp;nbsp;m OD) and over the [[South Downs]] near [[Goodwood Racecourse]] (167&amp;nbsp;m OD).  The steep gradients which would have been required if the road had followed a direct line would not have been practical for wheeled traffic and so the Roman engineers designed the road to cross the North Downs by natural breach cut by the River Mole and to pass to the east of the high ground of [[Leith Hill]]. The geology of the region was also considered and the road leaves the direct line at [[Ewell]] to move onto the well-drained [[chalk]] of the North Downs, in preference to remaining on the [[London Clay]]. The road is able to make a more gentle ascent of the South Downs [[escarpment]] at Bignor than was possible at Goodwood and the chosen route avoids the need for the road to cross the steep sided [[River Lavant, West Sussex|River Lavant]] valley at [[East Dean, West Sussex|East Dean]].&lt;br /&gt;
 
In order to accommodate and exploit the complex topology of the region, the road used four main straight sections (sometimes referred to as ''limbs''&lt;ref name=Belloc&gt;{{cite book |title=The Stane Street: A monograph |last= Belloc |first= H |year=1913 |publisher=Constable &amp; Co. Ltd. |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;) connected by shorter linking sections. Each limb could be surveyed separately using local vantage points. The major limbs were:
* London Bridge to Ewell
* Ewell to [[Mickleham, Surrey|Mickleham Downs]]
* South Holmwood to [[North Heath]] near Pulborough
* Pulborough to Chichester
The limbs were not joined directly to each other, but are linked instead by shorter segments.&lt;ref name=Margary/&gt;&lt;ref name = Belloc/&gt;
[[File:Stane street map 4.png|thumb|230px|Map of the longest limb between South Holmwood and North Heath, showing the survey line from Brockham Warren to Borough Hill.]]

The Roman surveying technique is clearly demonstrated by the longest of the four limbs from South Holmwood to North Heath (24.5&amp;nbsp;km or 15 miles).  The line that the road follows runs between two prominent hill tops, Borough Hill on the South Downs and Brockham Warren on the North Downs.&lt;ref name=Belloc/&gt; There are some short local variations from the straight line of the limb, for example the Roman road loops to the west for around 200&amp;nbsp;m at Okewood Hill to cross a small stream at a convenient fording point.&lt;ref name=Margary/&gt; South of North Heath the road turns by an angle of 7 degrees to head towards the crossing of the River Arun at Pulborough. North of South Holmwood, the road turns by a further 7 degrees to the north to approach Dorking.&lt;ref name=Margary/&gt;&lt;ref name=Belloc/&gt;

The average width of the paved road is {{convert|7.4|m|ft}}, or 25 Roman ''[[Pes (length)|pedes]]''. This is wider than the average {{convert|6.51|m|ft}} or 22 ''pedes'' for Roman roads in Britain. The overall width between the outer ditches, which can still be seen on aerial photographs taken over the South Downs, is {{convert|25.6|m|ft}} or 86 ''pedes''.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Davies ''Roads in Roman Britain'' 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-7524-2503-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual width of [[Metal (pavement)|metalling]] varies from place to place, and the outer ditches were found to be {{convert|27.4|m|ft}} apart at Westhampnet. Sections of intact road that have been excavated in several places show a variety of local materials, with the agger often being constructed of alternating layers of sand and gravel paved with large flint nodules, or sandstone, surfaced with smaller flint or sand and gravel. The metalling was generally about {{convert|30|cm|ft}} thick at the centre with a pronounced camber. Near to the Alfoldean station the metalling was constructed from iron slag in a solid 30&amp;nbsp;cm thick mass.&lt;ref name="Margary"/&gt;

==Posting stations==
[[File:Stane Street under pasture on the South Downs.JPG|thumb|300px|Stane Street under pasture on the South Downs.]]
There are two known posting stations or ''[[mansio]]nes'' along Stane Street, where official messengers could change horses and travellers could rest. These are at Alfoldean and [[Hardham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Illustrated History of Roman Roads in Britain |last=Johnston |first=David E |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1979 |publisher=Spurbooks Ltd. |location= |isbn=0-904978-33-8 |page=74 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mansiones'' were normally rectangular fortified sites of about 1 hectare (2.5 acres). The station at [[Alfoldean]] has been excavated.  The Alfoldean site is just south of the [[River Arun]] and partly covered by the A29 road. It was excavated by the Channel 4 archaeological television programme ''[[Time Team]]'', revealing the remains of a two-storey ''mansio'' built around a courtyard and also many other buildings. The site was enclosed by massive ramparts and ditches four metres wide and as deep which were dated by pottery finds to around 90 AD. The ditches were filled in by the mid-third century. The team's view was that the site had been an administrative and taxation centre for the [[Wealden iron industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2006_alf_found.html Unofficial Time Team website]&lt;/ref&gt; The western side of the Hardham station was destroyed by construction of the Pulborough to Midhurst railway, but most of it, including the north and south gateways, remains.

Two further stations at [[Merton Priory]] and [[Dorking]] have been postulated as being at suitable intervals, though the sites would now be hidden under modern development.&lt;ref name=Belloc/&gt; Alternative sites for the posting stations have also been suggested at [[Ewell]] and Burford Bridge (where the road  crossed the [[River Mole, Surrey|River Mole]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Neale K |year= 1972 |title= Stane Street (Chichester-London): The Third Mansio |journal= Surrey Archaeological Collections |publisher= Surrey Archaeological Society |volume= 69 |issue= |pages= 207–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==London Bridge to Ewell==
The line of the road runs south west from [[London Bridge]], between [[Borough High Street]] and [[Elephant and Castle]] forming the course of the present-day [[Newington Causeway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol25/pp1-8|title=Survey of London|chapter=Borough High Street, Blackman Street and Newington Causeway|chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol25/pp1-8|volume=Volume 25, St George's Fields (The Parishes of St. George the Martyr Southwark and St. Mary Newington)|editor=Ida Darlington|publisher=[[London County Council]]|via=[[British History Online]]|orig-year=1955|year=2015|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; then through [[Clapham]] and [[Tooting]] down to [[Colliers Wood]] and [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]]. Clapham Road and [[Kennington Park Road]] lie on top of Stane Street. It then crosses the [[River Wandle]] at the site of what later became [[Merton Priory]], and is then closely followed by the [[A24 road (Great Britain)|A24]] from [[Morden]] to [[Ewell]]. This is the only section of the road that is on the true line from London Bridge to the east gate of Chichester. The road passes through [[Sutton Common]] and forms the northern boundary of [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], formed from [[Old English]] 'sūth' and 'tūn', meaning "the south enclosure", which may have derived its name from its southerly position in relation to the road; the enclosure could have been Oldfields Farm, located at what is now [[Rosehill, London|Rosehill]].

==Ewell to South Holmwood==
At [[Ewell]] it bears to the left slightly, avoiding wet difficult [[alluvial]] soils by moving onto the [[chalk]], to cross the [[North Downs]] near [[Langley Vale]]. The section from Thirty Acres Barn, Ashtead to Mickleham Downs is well preserved and is listed as a [[scheduled monument]].&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; Stane Street crossed the [[River Mole, Surrey|River Mole]] via a [[ford (crossing)|ford]] close to the site of the modern Burford Bridge and excavations carried out in 1937 at the site revealed a "flint-surfaced approach to [a] ford at low level having all the signs of Roman workmanship".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 25 March 1937&lt;/ref&gt; The road passed through [[Dorking]] which was almost certainly a Roman station, although the exact course through the town is uncertain. This route takes the road east of [[Leith Hill]], one of the highest hills in southern England at 294 metres (965&amp;nbsp;feet).

==South Holmwood to Pulborough==
South of Dorking, near [[South Holmwood]], Stane Street takes a line sighted from London Bridge to Pulborough with most of this section still in use as the modern [[A29 road|A29]] which follows the line very closely through [[Billingshurst]] as far as [[Pulborough]]. This line to the east of the middle reaches of the [[River Arun]] is mostly free of steep gradients, although the modern road does avoid the hill at [[Rowhook]]. Just to the south of the steep descent from Rowhook through Roman Woods, where the road bridged the River Arun, some of the timber piles on which the bridge was built are still present in the river bed.&lt;ref name="ris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romansinsussex.co.uk/level3/search/detail.asp?maj_cat_search=communication&amp;objectnumber=251|title=Bridge Piles|work=Romans in Sussex|publisher=Sussex Archaeological Society|accessdate=26 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221224103/http://www.romansinsussex.co.uk/level3/search/detail.asp?maj_cat_search=communication&amp;objectnumber=251|archivedate=21 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scattered Roman tiles and squared stone in the river bed show that stone bridge piers were built above the piling.&lt;ref name=Margary/&gt; The Alfoldean station is some {{convert|30|m|yd}} south of the bridge site.

==Pulborough to Chichester==
[[File:Stane Street at Eartham Woods.JPG|thumb|300px|Stane Street at [[Eartham]] Woods]]
At Hardham, south west of Pulborough, there was a junction with the [[Sussex Greensand Way|Greensand Way]] Roman road to [[Lewes]] and a posting station near the junction. From here the alignment makes a beeline for Chichester, and passes the notable [[Roman villa]] at [[Bignor]], before making a slight detour from the line where it climbs the [[escarpment]] of the [[South Downs]], climbing a spur of chalk at Bignortail Wood and continuing as a man made terrace across the steep hillside. This terrace is well preserved on the downhill side of the top of the modern track which leads to the hilltop car park at [[Bignor Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Illustrated History of Roman Roads in Britain |last=Johnston |first=David E |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1979 |publisher=Spurbooks Ltd. |location= |isbn=0-904978-33-8 |page=113 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up on the open heath of the downs the line of the road can be followed very well on foot and is free of modern roads and paths. Walking south from Bignor Hill one soon comes to open sheep-grazed pasture at Gumber farm where the scale of the [[Agger (Roman word)|agger]] of the road can be clearly seen. The spire of [[Chichester cathedral]] can be seen above the distant trees, slightly to the right of the road line as the road heads for Chichester's east gate. Further on at Eartham Woods where the [[Monarch's Way]] long-distance path follows the route, the flint surface of the well-preserved road is exposed, the trees are mostly cut back to the boundary ditches, and the road seems little different from the time when the Legions left Britain. Although the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] made [[Chichester]] the capital of the South Saxon kingdom only the southern {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the southern section of the road into the [[western Weald]] have remained in use, as the A285.

==Branch roads==
The [[London to Brighton Way]] road diverged from Stane Street at [[Kennington Park]], passing through [[Croydon]], [[Godstone]], [[Haywards Heath]] and [[Burgess Hill]] to cross the South Downs at [[Clayton, West Sussex|Clayton]].

From [[Rowhook]] a road went northwest to [[Farley Heath]] at the foot of the [[North Downs]] where it passes through a Roman temple site.

The [[Sussex Greensand Way]] branches from Stane Street at Hardham waystation, following a well-drained sandstone ridge east to [[Lewes]].

To the north of Pulborough another road branched off in a southeasterly direction, crossing the Greensand Way at [[Wiggonholt]]. It is unclear whether it continued beyond this towards [[Storrington]].

At [[Westhampnett]], near the Rolls-Royce works, the Roman coastal road, which became the older A27 road, branches from Stane Street at the mini-roundabout.  The Roman road continues via [[Broadwater, West Sussex|Broadwater]], [[Sompting]], [[Lancing, West Sussex|Lancing]] (along a road still named The Street) and part of the Old Shoreham Road (the A270) through to ''Novus Portus'' (around modern Portslade).

[[File:Ms digby 133 - 37r - The Conversion of St Paul.jpg|thumb|right|Opening page of the ''Conversion of Saint Paul'' ([[Bodleian Library]], MS Digby 133, folio 37r)]]
'''''The Digby Conversion of Saint Paul''''' (or '''''The Conuersyon of Seynt Paule''''') is a [[Middle English]] [[miracle play]] of the late [[15th century in literature|fifteenth century]]. Written in [[rhyme royal]], it is about the [[conversion of Paul the Apostle]].&lt;ref name="Sharp" /&gt;
It is part of a collection of mystery plays that was bequeathed to the [[Bodleian Library]] by Sir [[Kenelm Digby]] in 1634.

==The Play==

The action is in three well-defined parts, often, following medieval practice, referred to as "stations". Each of these stations is introduced and concluded by "Poeta" ([[Latin]] for poet).

The first station represents [[Jerusalem]]. After the [[prologue]] there follows a dance, the direction for which has been added in by a later hand, seemingly in an attempt to make the piece more exciting.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;''Chief Pre-Shakespearean Dramas'' edited by [[Joseph Quincy Adams]], [[Houghton Mifflin Company]], 1924&lt;/ref&gt; The play proper begins with [[Paul of Tarsus|Saul]], dressed in rich apparel, boasting of his power and of the fear which he inspires, doing so "a little in the Herod style".&lt;ref name="Sharp"&gt;''Ancient Mysteries from the Digby Manuscripts'' edited by [[Thomas Sharp (antiquary)|Thomas Sharp]], printed for the [[Abbotsford Club]] by the Edinburgh Printing Company, 1835&lt;/ref&gt; The priests [[Caiaphas|Caypha]] and Anna give him letters to take to [[Damascus]], where he is to suppress heresy (i.e. the worship of Jesus). Saul then gathers together his knights and servants, who agree to follow him. There follows a comic scene, not present in other versions of the Conversion, between one of Saul's servants and an [[hostler]], who ready a horse which Saul then rides off on. Poeta re-enters to "mak a conclusyon" of this first station, and again the stage direction "daunce" has been written in a later hand.

In the next station, on the road to Damascus, [[God in Christianity|God]], amidst thunder and lightning, visits Saul and rebukes him for persecuting His followers and tells him to enter Damascus. When the visitation is over Saul finds that he is blind and lame. God also visits [[Ananias of Damascus|Ananias]], an inhabitant of Damscus, and tells him to go and cure Saul, assuring him that from now on Saul will advance, rather than persecute, Christianity. As Ananias visits Saul the [[Holy Spirit]] appears above them, and Saul is healed and [[baptism|baptised]].

In the third station Saul's knights have returned to Jerusalem,&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt; where they tell an angry Caypha and Anna of Paul's conversion to and preaching of Christianity. At this point three leaves have been inserted in a different hand. They make up a comic scene between the demon [[Belial]] (whose first line is "the usual Satanic exclamation of the mystery writers 'Ho ho'"&lt;ref name="Sharp"/&gt;) and his messenger, named Mercury. Again, [[Joseph Quincy Adams]] believes this has been included to make the play more exciting.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt; The choice of Belial as the chief demon seems to have been influenced by Saul's swearing "By the god Bellyall" in his first scene. The interpolated text also contains material that could be seen as [[anti-Semitic]] and which is not mirrored in the main text – Belial claims that he is worshipped "In the temples and synogoges" and that Caypha and Anna are his "prelates" and are planning to persecute Saul on his suggestion. Heather Hill-Vásquez, however, interprets Caypha and Anna (in the 16th-century version) as standing for [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Bishop (Catholicism)|bishops]] and their link to Belial as a [[Protestant Reformation]] attack on the old religion in a play that is an appropriation of one of its forms of dissemination, the (processional) [[Saint play]].&lt;ref name="HHV"&gt;''Sacred Players: The Politics of Response in the Middle English Religious Drama'' by Heather Hill-Vásquez, [[Catholic University of America Press]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The play proper resumes with Saul (the play does not include his renaming as Paul), now dressed as a disciple of Jesus, delivering to the audience a rather lengthy sermon on the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]. Saul is taken to Caypha and Anna, who order the gates of the city to be locked that they might kill him shortly. However, an angel appears and tells Saul that he will not die yet, and that a place for him in heaven is assured. Saul's escape from the city in a basket is described, not staged. The play ends with Poeta inviting the audience to sing the [[hymn]] ''Exultet caelum laudibus''. While Scherb praises the swift ending and finds its reliance on words rather than images appropriate to the play's thematic focus on faith and the movement from iconography to rhetoric,&lt;ref name="Scherb"/&gt; Coldewey simply finds it abrupt.&lt;ref name="Coldewey"/&gt;

==Scholarship==

The text of ''The Conversion of Saint Paul'' is one of five plays (one a fragment) bound together in MS Digby 133, which is preserved in the [[Bodleian Library]], having been bequeathed to it by [[Sir Kenelm Digby]] in 1634. Though critics sometimes write of a "Digby playwright" (particularly when examining the ''Conversion'' alongside the ''Mary Magdalene'', the other surviving English Saint play derived from the [[New Testament]]), the pieces are in fact independent;&lt;ref name="Coldewey"&gt;''Early English Drama: an anthology'' edited by John C. Coldewey, [[Routledge]], 1993, {{ISBN|978-0-8240-5465-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the plays' first modern editor, Thomas Sharp, sees in the ''Conversion'' "a considerable resemblance in general structure and composition to [''The Digby Massacre of the Innocents'']"&lt;ref name="Sharp"/&gt; The plays date from the late fifteenth century and have a transcription date of 1512 on the first page.&lt;ref name="Kinghorn"&gt;''Mediæval Drama'' by A. M. Kinghorn, [[Evans Brothers (publisher)|Evans Brothers]], London 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Furnivall"&gt;''The Digby Mysteries'' edited by [[F. J. Furnivall]], New Shakspere Society/N. Trübner &amp; Co., 1882&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the ''Conversion'' and ''[[The Digby play of Mary Magdalene]]'' there are plays on the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] and the [[resurrection of Jesus]], and an incomplete version of the [[morality play]] ''[[Wisdom (play)|Wisdom]]'' entitled ''Wisdom, Who is Christ''.

Adams believed the play to have been written by an author from the [[East Midlands]], to be performed at stations in a small village on 25 January, that being the Festival of the Conversion of St. Paul.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt; And while A. M. Kinghorn has it that the play was performed in a fixed locality and was the responsibility, not of the town's guilds, but of the church;&lt;ref name="Kinghorn"/&gt; [[Glynne Wickham]], citing the text's many apologies for its "simpleness", argued that the play, in its final form at any rate, belonged "to a Guild of artisans who were willing to travel and to adapt their script and presentation to the environment offered by their sponsors and hosts in exchange for hospitality and a small fee" and thus, while the Digby plays may have originated, like the so-called Macro plays – ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'', ''[[Mankind (play)|Mankind]]'', and ''[[Wisdom (play)|Wisdom]]'' –, in or near [[Bury St Edmunds]] in [[East Anglia]],&lt;ref name="Wickham"&gt;''English Moral Interludes'' edited by [[Glynne Wickham]], [[Everyman's Library]], 1976&lt;/ref&gt; they were able to migrate to [[Chelmsford]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="HHV"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre'' edited by Richard Beadle and Alan J. Fletcher, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furnivall could see little in the play that pointed to a specific dialect, other than a few instances that inclined him more to a [[English Midlands|Midlands]] dialect than anything else.&lt;ref name="Furnivall"/&gt; A later editor, Coldewey, described the dialect as [[East Anglian English|East Anglian]],&lt;ref name="Coldewey"/&gt; though note that the [[East Midlands English|East Midlands]] border on East Anglia.

Sarah Salih has speculated that ''[[Margery Kempe|The Book of Margery Kempe]]'', written in East Anglia, could have provided inspiration for the Digby plays of conversion, that is the ''Conversion of Paul'' and the ''Mary Magdalene''.&lt;ref&gt;''Gender and Holiness: Men, Women, and Saints in Late Medieval Europe'' edited by Samantha Riches and Sarah Salih, [[Routledge]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The interpolations to the original text (the marginal "daunce" stage directions and the three leaves containing the scene between the devils) seem to come from an early sixteenth-century revival of the piece, and were possibly the work of a man named Myles Blomfylde (whose exact identity is unclear), who may have played the role of Poeta.&lt;ref name="HHV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coldewey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wickham"/&gt;

The play was not much admired by its 19th- and early 20th-century editors: Furnivall wrote that it (and the Digby mysteries as a whole) pointed to "the decay of the old religious Drama in England"&lt;ref name="Furnivall"/&gt; and [[John Matthews Manly|Manly]] found it "uninteresting" and of only historical value.&lt;ref&gt;''Specimens of the Pre-Shaksperean Drama, Vol. 1'' edited by [[John Matthews Manly]], Ginn and Company, Boston, 1897&lt;/ref&gt; Adams has sympathy with the later author's attempt to introduce more excitement to the piece and goes so far as to omit almost entirely Saul's long sermon on the Seven Deadly Scenes on the grounds of its having "no dramatic value".&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt; For Chester N. Scoville, however, it is just this sermon, rather than Saul's actual conversion, that is at the heart of the play.&lt;ref name="Scoville"&gt;''Saints and the Audience in Middle English Biblical Drama'' by Chester Norman Scoville, [[University of Toronto Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-8020-8944-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Scoville is typical of late 20th- and 21st-century critics, who have found richness in the play and, in its unclear staging, strategies for interpretation.

==Staging==

{{quote|"The audience, which is made to be more directly involved in this than in perhaps any other Middle English play, must both physically and rhetorically reconfigure itself constantly to engage with the scenes played before it."|Chester N. Scoville|''Saints and the Audience in Middle English Biblical Drama''&lt;ref name="Scoville"/&gt;}}

{{quote|"'''Poeta''': Honorable frendes, beseechyng yow of lycens / To proceede owr processe … / … / … with yowr favour, begynyng owr proces"|lines 8–9, 14}}

{{quote|"'''Poeta''': Fynally, of this stacon thus we mak a conclusyon, / Besecchyng thys audyens to folow and succede / With all your delygens this generall processyon"|lines 155-7}}

The play's earliest editors all agreed the original production would have been of the processional sort, with a wagon travelling between three different stations to perform the three scenes of the play, and the audience following, rather as they would performing [[the Stations of the Cross]]. The need to accommodate a horse must have meant that the wagon would be fairly large, and with an upper story in order for the Holy Spirit to appear above and from which thunderbolts could be thrown.&lt;ref name="Furnivall"/&gt; Lines in Saul's sermon – "thys semely [assembly] that here syttyth or stonde" – led scholars to conjecture that a scaffold may have been erected for this and perhaps other stations.

It was not until the 1970s that Glynne Wickham, first in an essay and then in his edition of the play, challenged this conception, arguing that the three stations had taken the form either of mobile "pageants" or fixed "mansions" grouped together on a single acting area, or "platea".&lt;ref name="Wickham"/&gt; As William Tydeman points out, much hinges on how one interprets "processyon" in line 157 – as referring to a physical procession, or to the procession of the stage action.&lt;ref&gt;''The Theatre in the Middle Ages: Western European Stage Conditions, c. 800–1576'' by William Tydeman, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1979 {{ISBN|978-0-8132-1497-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this line is part of a passage marked "si placet" (i.e. optional) in the text, Wickham believes it hardly likely to have been a direction to the audience, and that it should be interpreted, along with "proces" in line 9 and 14, as signifying the thrust of an argument, and not physical movement.&lt;ref name="Wickham"/&gt; In his edition of 1993, Coldewey takes up a revisionist stance, believing that the play was processional in nature and clearly unconvinced by Wickham's argument.&lt;ref name="Coldewey"/&gt;

Victor I. Scherb, taking the processional staging as read, builds from it an interpretation that sees the play as a theatrical [[triptych]] that uses framing devices which serve to draw the audience's focus on the central scene, that of Saul's conversion. This station is framed spatially not only by the procession, but also in terms of "high" and "low", thanks to scenes involving God, devils and ostlers. Indeed, the ostler with ideas above his station being seen thrown in dung is taken as a reflection of Saul's own pride, for which he is cast down on the road to Damascus. The purpose of these devices is to provide the audience – turned, thanks to the amount of direct address in the play, into a congregation – with a spiritual model of the turning away from worldliness.&lt;ref name="Scherb"/&gt;

==Performances==

For the 1982 production at [[Winchester Cathedral]] the stage direction "daunce" was interpreted as a means of moving the audience across stations.&lt;ref name="HHV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scherb"&gt;''Staging Faith: East Anglian Drama in the Later Middle Ages'' by Victor I. Scherb, [[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]], 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-8386-3878-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Digby Conversion of St. Paul'' was also performed in 1994 by [[Poculi Ludique Societas]] in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~plspls/pastprod.html Past productions]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, The Marlowe Project, a production company devoted to early theatre, performed ''The Conversion of Saint Paul'' at the Church for All Nations in New York City. The text was modernised and slightly adapted by director Jeff Dailey, who also wrote about the problems performing the play in his article, "Saint Paul's Horse and Related Problems" in the 2001 edition of ''Research Opportunities in Renaissance Drama.''

'''''The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel''''' is an American [[Historical period drama|period]] [[comedy-drama]] [[web television]] series created by [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]], that premiered on March 17, 2017. The series stars [[Rachel Brosnahan]] as the titular Miriam "Midge" Maisel, a housewife in 1958 [[New York City]] who discovers she has a knack for stand-up comedy. Following the premiere of the pilot episode to critical acclaim, the series was picked up by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] for a two-season order on April 10, 2017.

The first season was released on November 29, 2017, to positive reviews. The series won two [[Golden Globe Award]]s ([[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy|Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actress – Musical or Comedy]] for Brosnahan) and five [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] for Brosnahan. It was renewed for a third season on May 20, 2018, before the second season had aired. The second season is scheduled to premiere on December 5, 2018.

==Plot==
Miriam "Midge" Maisel is an upper middle class [[American Jews|Jewish]] [[housewife]] living on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in 1958. Her husband, Joel, is a businessman who moonlights as a struggling comedian at [[The Gaslight Cafe]].

One night, after a particularly unsuccessful performance as a stand-up comedian, Joel confesses to Midge that he has been having an affair with his secretary, and leaves her. Devastated when her husband walks out, with her powder-blue suitcase, Midge gets drunk and returns to the Gaslight Cafe. She impulsively goes on stage, delivering an impromptu set,  confessing her predicament to the audience. Her bawdy, biting and brilliant delivery enthralls the audience. She gets so carried away describing her misfortune, that she partly strips, after which she is promptly arrested. She is hauled off to jail with the not-yet famous, iconic comic, [[Lenny Bruce]]. After she bails him out of jail, Bruce warns Midge that the comedy business is terrible, but Midge takes his warning as encouragement and teams up with Susie Meyerson, Gaslight Cafe comedy club employee and comic manager wannabe, to hone her act. Susie encourages Midge to push herself to become a professional stand-up comedienne, although Midge at first is not so sure.

When Midge moves back in with her parents with her two young children, she decides to get a job as a cosmetics saleswoman at the high-end department store, [[B. Altman and Company|B. Altman]]. Her job exposes her to an additional world which she can draw from to develop her comedy, in addition to providing a sense of independence. She begins to go to parties, further developing her comic skills.

After touring around the many clubs to see a variety of comedians performing in New York, she meets top comedienne, Sophie Lennon, and is invited to visit her for lunch before Midge opens for her in a New Jersey club. At lunch Midge discovers that the real Sophie is a far cry from the comic persona she portrays on stage. Lennon urges Midge to find a persona for herself, warning her that she will not  succeed at comedy by just being "herself," because no one wants to laugh at a beautiful, smart, feminine woman - only men can be themselves on stage. Not one to be told that she is not good enough for anything, Midge exposes Lennon's secret in a hilarious routine which gets her and Susie "blackballed" from any and all venues in New York. Once again enlisting the help of Bruce, Midge is able to perform, and brings down the house with her insightful, but caustic humor. Unbeknownst to Midge, her husband is in the audience. They had just the night before gotten back together, but nevertheless Midge is still hurt over the affair and the separation, and expresses her feelings in her set. Joel, Midge's husband, leaves the club, drunk and confused when he realizes just how much he hurt Midge, and how talented and funny she is. Season One ends with Midge declaring her new stage name is Mrs. Maisel.

Midge's brother Noah and his wife Astrid (a [[gentile]] who enthusiastically converted to Judaism to impress the unbothered Weissmans) visit to join in the celebration. But when Midge's family goes out to celebrate at a Chinese restaurant, the occasion is spoiled because Joel and Penny Pann are in the same restaurant. Joel apologizes to Midge before noticing that she no longer wears her wedding and engagement rings. When Midge visits Susie at her apartment, Susie bluntly tells Midge that they are in a partnership and Midge doesn't require a man to be a successful comic. Midge tearfully apologizes yet insists that Susie needs to support Midge personally if they're going to be professional partners, and the two reconcile. As the episode ends, Virgil and Oz are shown from above enjoying a tape of Midge's earlier comic performances. Not knowing her name, they label the tape they have "Mrs. X at the Gaslight."

|ShortSummary    = Midge hones her comedy act. At work, Joel's ideas win him fans. Susie tries to get Midge a chance to open for comedienne Sophie Lennon. Abe brings home a surprise dinner guest--a divorce attorney. Rose is furious, and not consoled when Abe confesses that Joel already tried to come back but Midge turned him away. Rose seeks consolation from Drina, but Drina has vanished, replaced by "Madame Cosma." Joel tells Abe that, with his new promotion, he can pay for everything Midge might want. Midge visits Sophie Lennon (played by [[Jane Lynch]]), discovering that the beloved comedienne "from [[Queens]]" is really a rich and arrogant graduate of [[Yale University]]. Onstage "Sophie" is a gimmick, wearing a fat suit. The real Sophie tells Midge that women can't succeed without gimmicks. As Midge leaves to meet her parents in synagogue, Sophie forces a mink coat on her for a parting gift. In synagogue, Rose loudly demands to know where the mink coat came from. Later, at the Gaslight, Midge lampoons expectations imposed on women, and makes fun of Sophie Lennon, exposing her act in the process. Sophie's agent Harry, in the audience to hear Midge perform, is furious, and tells the terrified Susie, "You're on my bad side!"

|ShortSummary    = Susie and Midge get drunk at a bar, upset that Midge made fun of Sophie Lennon, and now Harry might try to ruin her career. The next day, a hungover Midge hosts a birthday party for her son, where she reconnects with Joel and ends up sleeping with him in her childhood room. It appears that they may get back together, but Joel later overhears a bootleg tape of Midge's first act at Virgil and Oz's record store, and gets angry. At the big company meeting, a deflated Joel announces that he wants to quit. Midge's "shit gig" at a stripper show is canceled because of Harry. Susie begs Lenny Bruce to come back to the Gaslight to help Midge, which he does. Midge's set is a great hit, and at the end she introduces herself as "Mrs. Maisel."  Joel watches Midge's act, argues with Susie about it, then sadly leaves the Gaslight, attacking one of her hecklers while admitting her act was great.

==Production==
===Background===
Amy Sherman-Palladino was inspired by childhood memories of her father (a standup comedian based in NYC) and an admiration for early female comics such as [[Joan Rivers]].&lt;ref name="VF1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/gilmore-girls-amy-sherman-palladino-amazon-pilot-marvelous-mrs-maisel |title=Gilmore Girls Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino Explains her Marvelous New TV Series |last=Busis |first=Hillary |work=Vanity Fair |quote=The show charts the improbable journey of one Miriam “Midge” Maisel (House of Cards alum Rachel Brosnahan), a perfect 50s housewife who seems to have everything—until her life implodes in a spectacular way.

And in falling apart, she discovers an ambition and a need to speak, and a voice that she just frankly didn’t know was there.”&lt;ref name="VF2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/marvelous-mrs-maisel-amazon-amy-sherman-palladino-set-visit |title=Corsets and Comedy: Inside Amazon’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel |last=Zuckerman |first=Esther |work=Vanity Fair |quote=“I wanted to do a story about a woman who thought she’d scored,” Sherman-Palladino explains to a group of reporters. “She’d gotten it all, and then, bam, it all falls apart.

The series drew inspiration from female comedians of the time period like Rivers and [[Totie Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rachel Brosnahan on how 'trailblazer' Joan Rivers inspired Marvelous Mrs Maisel|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/11/29/rachel-brosnahan-on-how-trailblazer-joan-rivers-inspired-amazons-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-7119853/|accessdate=December 12, 2017|work=Metro|date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes122017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Soloski|first1=Alexis|title=Did You Hear the One About the Housewife Who Walks Into a Comedy Club?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/arts/television/marvelous-mrs-maisel-amazon-amy-sherman-palladino.html|accessdate=December 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot episode of ''The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel'' was one of Amazon Video's most successful ever, achieving an average viewer rating of 4.9 (out of 5).&lt;ref name="PilotResponse"/&gt; The review of the pilot in ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the "combination of [Sherman-Palladino's] banging dialogue and the utterly winning charm of Brosnahan",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Marvellous Mrs Maisel: from the writer of Gilmore Girls, with brazen nods to Mad Men|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/16/the-marvellous-mrs-maisel-from-the-writer-of-gilmore-girls-with-brazen-nods-to-mad-men|website=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' praised the "outstanding" [[production design]] and said "this is a series that's as confident as its heroine—and what a heroine she is. Midge is already layered, conflicted, hilarious, and charming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amy Sherman-Palladino’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel pilot lives up to its title|url=https://tv.avclub.com/amy-sherman-palladino-s-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-pilot-1798190791|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critic for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' called the episode "a knockout", stating that the stand-up element "introduces a welcome streak of discipline, both verbal and thematic, into Sherman-Palladino’s charming but manic work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amid a Slew of Lackluster Amazon Pilots, Amy Sherman-Palladino’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Is a Knockout|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/03/20/amid_a_slew_of_lackluster_amazon_pilots_amy_sherman_palladino_s_the_marvelous.html|website=Slate|accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' highlighted the exceptionally well done "Jewishness" of the work, calling it a "comedic delight of a show, combining Sherman-Palladino’s knack for witty dialogue with the colorful, rich world of 1950s New York and the intensity of family drama and changing times."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/The-marvelous-Jewish-story-of-Miriam-Maisel-517215|title=The ‘marvelous’ Jewish story of Miriam Maisel|work=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NPR]] similarly highlighted the effectiveness of the comedy in the show, writing "''The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel''&amp;nbsp;isn't aiming for realism. It's a heroic fantasy. And Midge's humor, one might say, is the ultimate version of staircase wit. Recklessly honest, she says what female comedians&amp;nbsp;''would've''&amp;nbsp;said half a century ago — if they had only been free to say it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/12/04/568281875/zippy-and-delightful-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-spotlights-an-unlikely-comic|title=Zippy And Delightful, 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Spotlights An Unlikely Comic|work=NPR.org|access-date=December 7, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Teapot'''" ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Theepotten'') is a literary [[fairy tale]] by Danish [[poet]] and [[author]] [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a teapot and her adventures. The tale was first published 1863 and demonstrates the Andersen's talent for investing ordinary household objects with life, character, and personality.

== Plot summary ==
A porcelain teapot rules the tea table. She is very proud of her handle and spout, but not quite so proud of her lid (which is cracked). She is very proud of holding the tea leaves and of being the one to pour forth her contents for thirsty humankind. One day, the teapot is dropped and the handle and spout are broken. She is given to a beggar woman who fills her with soil and plants a flowering bulb within her. The teapot then feels a happiness she has never known. At the last, the teapot is broken in two, the bulb removed to a bigger pot, and the teapot thrown away. She cherishes her memories.

== Publication history==
[[Image:teapot Pedersen 01.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Lorenz Frølich]], an early illustrator of Andersen's works]]
The tale was first published December 1863 in ''Folkekalender for Danmark''. The work was republished 12 December 1871 in the fourth volume of ''Fairy Tales and Stories. 1871.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=160 |publisher=Hans Christian Andersen Center |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Teapot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Versus: Quaderni di studi semiotici''''' (often abbreviated as '''VS''')&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN search link|0393-8255}} Entry in the Worldcat ISSN database&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[semiotic]] [[Academic journal|journal]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://acnp.cib.unibo.it/cgi-ser/start/en/cnr/dc-p2.tcl?catno=23547&amp;language=ITALIANO&amp;libr= Where to find VS in Italian libraries&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Umberto Eco]], et al. in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssub.unibo.it/pagine_principali/Curriculum_eco.htm Eco's curriculum vitae from the Scuola Superiore di Studi Umanistici, University of Bologna, Italy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205081809/http://www.sssub.unibo.it/pagine_principali/Curriculum_eco.htm |date=December 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been an important confrontation space for a large number of scholars of several fields coping with signs and signification. Its foundation and activities have contributed to consolidate the perception of semiotics as an academic field in itself both in Italy and in Europe.

''Versus'' has published original articles by most influential European semioticians, including; [[Umberto Eco]], [[Greimas|A.J. Greimas]], [[Jean-Marie Floch]], Paolo Fabbri, [[Jacques Fontanille]], [[Claude Zilberberg]], [[Ugo Volli]] and [[Patrizia Violi]]. At the same time, almost every issue also contains articles by younger, less famous semioticians dealing with new research perspectives in semiotics.

Each issue is focused on a specific argument, like iconism, translation and history of sign or on studies regarding a specific author (such as [[Louis Hjelmslev]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] or [[Michel Bréal]]).

'''Yarimburgaz Cave''' ({{lang-tr|Yarımburgaz Mağarası}}) is a [[cave]] of significant archaeological and paleontological importance, located within [[Istanbul Province]], Turkey.

==Location==
[[File:YarımburgazCave (9).JPG|thumb|left|A view to the Sazlıdere Valley and [[Lake Büyükçekmece]] seen from the cave.]]
Yarımburgaz Cave is approximately {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the city of [[Istanbul]], and about {{convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Lake Küçükçekmece]] and south of [[Sazlıdere Dam]]. It is situated in a locality known today as Altınşehir, within the neighborhood of Güvercintepe in [[Başakşehir]] district.&lt;ref name="um"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ah1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ah4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ah7"/&gt;

==Geology and formation==
The cave was formed as a result of a [[subterranean river]] eroding an ancient limestone formation.&lt;ref name="tp"/&gt; It has two entrances, one above the other. The lower entrance is at an altitude of {{convert|11.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Sea level#AMSL|AMSL]], which the upper entrance is situated {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} above. The cave is on the eastern bank of the Sazlıdere creek, which empties into Lake Küçükçekmece.&lt;ref name="tp"/&gt; The entrances face southwards overlooking Sazlıdere Valley. Whereas the lower cave has a length of {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the upper is only {{convert|52|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. After about {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} inside, a short, sloping passage connects both caves.&lt;ref name="um"/&gt; The lower cave is in the form of a meandering tunnel, forking into two at a distance of {{convert|240|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the mouth. The upper cave's chamber is {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height.&lt;ref name="tp"/&gt;

==Scientific research==
[[File:İstanbul Arkeoloji Müzesi - Yarımburgaz Mağarası (Başakşehir).jpg|thumb|upright|Artifacts from Yarımburgaz Cave displayed at [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]

The cave is an important [[fossil]] site which has been researched by [[archaeology|archeologist]]s, [[paleontology|paleontologist]]s, [[geoarchaeology|geoarchaeologist]]s and [[biospeleology|biospeleologist]]s. Scientific exploration of the cave began in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ag"/&gt; [[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavation]] attempts made in 1920 were followed by systematic archaeological work in the 1980s financially supported by the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref name="um"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ah7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="af"/&gt;&lt;ref name="n1"/&gt;

In the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]], a cave-church was carved into the walls of the upper cave,&lt;ref name="ah9"/&gt; and a monastery was built outside the cave mouth. Although these alterations may have resulted in the loss of prehistoric material, some artefacts remain in the cave. In the upper cave, traces of settlements were found dating back to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] subdivision of the [[Stone Age]] up until the [[Chalcolithic]] period of the [[Bronze Age]]. These traces were lying on beach sand from the [[Marine Isotope Stage 5|last interglacial period]] and beneath debris from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and later times. The beach sand covers [[sediment]]s with [[Lower Paleolithic]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s. The upper cave was destroyed by [[treasure hunting]] and illicit diggings, which left {{convert|2|-|3|m|ft|abbr=on}}-deep pits.&lt;ref name="tp"/&gt; Unlike the prehistoric deposits found in the lower cave, the upper cave lacks any evidence of debris from that era.&lt;ref name="um"/&gt;

The existence of paleontological and archaeological findings point towards the use of the cave as a [[human]] and an [[Fauna|animal]] habitat, alternatively.&lt;ref name="n1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbua"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ucl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ah3"/&gt; The finds include bones of [[herbivore]] and [[carnivore]] [[mammal]]s,&lt;ref name="nbc1"/&gt; marine and freshwater [[mollusc]]s,&lt;ref name="mj"/&gt; [[microfauna]] as well as artifacts like [[potsherd]]s, knives on [[flint]], [[oldowan]]s, [[chopper (archaeology)|chopper]]s and [[hammerstone]]s on [[quartzite]], as well as [[manuport]]s. The wide variety of prehistoric faunal specimens belong to bones of herbivore mammals such as cave bears (''[[Ursus deningeri]]''), horses (''[[Equus caballus]]''), wild boars (''[[Sus scrofa]]''), fallow deer (''[[Dama dama]]''), roe deer (''[[Capreolus capreolus]]''), deer (''[[Megaloceros]]''), cattle (''[[Bos]]''/''[[Bison]]''), antilopes (''[[Gazella]]''), goats (''[[Capra (genus)|Capra]]''), and carnivores such as wolves and dogs (''[[Canis]]''), foxes (''[[Vulpes]]''), tigers (''[[Panthera]]''), cats (''[[Felis]]'') and hyenas (''[[Crocuta]]'').&lt;ref name="um"/&gt; Findings of "more than 5000 fossil bones and teeth of cave and brown bears", which provide some chronological indicators, led to their extensive scientific study.&lt;ref name="bbua"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ua"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usg"/&gt; Another subject of such extensive study were the fossils of several species of [[Middle Pleistocene]] bats ([[Chiroptera]]), including horseshoe bats (''[[Rhinolophus]]''), mouse-eared bats (''[[Myotis]]''),  long-eared bats (''[[Plecotus]]'') and bent-winged bats (''[[Miniopterus]]'').&lt;ref name="eg"/&gt;

Some artifacts found in Yarımburgaz Cave are exhibited in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].&lt;ref name="ah2"/&gt;

In 2001, Yarımburgaz Cave was declared an archaeological-nature reserve of first grade.&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ah4"/&gt; It is also listed as "Cultural Property under Enhanced Protection".&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;

==Human impact==
[[File:YarımburgazCave (10).JPG|thumb|upright|Barred main entrance of lower cave.]]

During the last two decades, the cave suffered serious, irreversible damage caused by the external interactions of humans.&lt;ref name="r2"/&gt; Following scientific excavations inside the cave, and the related publications in the 1990s, the cave gained wide popularity. For this reason, it was brought to the attention of several picnickers, treasure hunters,&lt;ref name="ag"/&gt; illegal explorers, amateur [[speleology|speleologist]]s and archaeologists due to its past use as a historic cave-church and its proximity to the city center.&lt;ref name="tp"/&gt; In order to prevent further damage, the cave was closed off with iron bar gates during the scientific excavations between 1988 and 1990.&lt;ref name="tp"/&gt; However, because of neglect by the respective authorities, the gates lost their function in later years, and the cave would inevitably become a shelter frequented by drug users and prostitutes, who littered it.&lt;ref name="ah1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="n1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ah2"/&gt; Currently, the cave walls are painted and scratched with [[graffiti]].&lt;ref name="ah9"/&gt;

To establish a mushroom farm inside the cave, the cave grounds were leveled by a grader.&lt;ref name="tp"/&gt; The mouth of the cave was enlarged even to enable the grader's entry.&lt;ref name="ag"/&gt;

The cave was also used several times as a setting in filmmaking and television productions that left permanent modifications inside the cave.&lt;ref name="tp"/&gt; The cave featured in the 1971 movie ''Ali Baba ve Kırk Haramiler'' (English: "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves"), based on the folk tale [[Ali Baba]], with a role as the treasure cave that opens with the [[magic word]]s "[[Open Sesame (phrase)|open sesame]]" and closes off with "close sesame", respectively. For the filming of an episode of the television series ''Küçük Ağa'' (English: "Little Agha"), historic [[fresco]]s on the cave walls were scratched off and removed, and some of them were painted over with [[exit signs]]. During the filming of the [[science-fiction]] movie ''Yorr’un Öyküsü'' (English: "The Story of Yorr"), a large pool was built inside the cave, which was then detonated by explosives according to the scenario. The cave also became a setting for the television comedy series ''[[Leyla ile Mecnun]]'' produced by the state-owned [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]] (TRT), in which fire was set to depict hell. The filming of some episodes of the television series ''[[Muhteşem Yüzyıl]]'' (English: "The Magnificent Century"), a prime-time historical [[soap opera]], inside the cave without proper permission allegedly caused damage to the cave.&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt; As such, the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] filed a complaint against the producers.&lt;ref name="ah1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ah4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="af"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ah6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt;

A group of local politicians inspected the cave in February 2015, and reported that the cave's protection is still neglected despite its importance and status.&lt;ref name="ah1"/&gt;

'''Zahi Hawass''' ({{lang-ar|زاهي حواس}}; born May 28, 1947) is an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[archaeology|archaeologist]], an [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], and former Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs.  He has also worked at archaeological sites in the [[Nile Delta]], the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]], and the [[Upper and Lower Egypt|Upper Nile Valley]].

==Early life and education==
Hawass was born in a small village near [[Damietta]], Egypt.&lt;ref name="RiseFall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-of-zahi-hawass-72874123/?all|title=The Rise and Fall and Rise of Zahi Hawass|first=Joshua|last=Hammer|publisher=|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he originally dreamed of becoming an attorney,&lt;ref name="RiseFall"/&gt; he obtained a [[bachelor of arts]] degree in Greek and Roman Archaeology from [[Alexandria University]] in Alexandria, Egypt in 1967.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drhawass.com/wp/bio/|title=DR ZAHI  -  Dr Zahi|website=www.drhawass.com|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, Hawass earned a diploma in Egyptology from [[Cairo University]].&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;  Hawass then worked at the Great Pyramids as an inspector—a combination of administrator and archaeologist.&lt;ref name="RiseFall"/&gt;  When he was 33 years old, Hawass was awarded a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] to attend the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]] to study Egyptology,&lt;ref name="RiseFall"/&gt; earning a [[master of arts]] degree in Egyptology and Syro-Palestinian Archaeology in 1983, and his PhD in Egyptology in 1987&lt;ref name="RiseFall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; from the [[Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World]] (AAMW), concentrating on "The Funerary Establishments of Khufu, Khafra and Menkaura During the Old Kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = AAMW | date = 2009 | title = Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World (AAMW) Alumni: Dissertations related to Mediterranean and Near Eastern Art and Archaeology (since 1898) | url = http://www.sas.upenn.edu/aamw/alumni | location = Philadelphia, PA, USA | publisher = University of Pennsylvania, School of Arts and Sciences | access-date = 25 January 2016 | quote = Zahi Abass Hawass / The Funerary Establishments of Khufu, Khafra and Menkaura During the Old Kingdom / 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 protest vandalism===
On January 29, 2011, in the midst of the [[2011 Egyptian protests|Egyptian protests of that year]], Hawass arrived at the [[Egyptian Museum]]  to find that a number of cases had been broken into and a number of antiquities damaged, so police were brought in to secure the museum.&lt;ref name="Joffe"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Joffe | first = Alex | date = 2011 | title= Arts Link: Egypt's Antiquities Fall Victim to the Mob | format = online | issue = February 1 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703833204576114580200904212 | accessdate= 25 January 2016 | journal = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | quote = "Subtitle: A definitive answer to the question: Should the Elgin Marbles be returned to Greece?" }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andrew Lawler, reporting for ''Science,'' Hawass "faxed a colleague in Italy that 13 cases were destroyed.

"My heart is broken and my blood is boiling," the U.S.-trained archaeologist lamented." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawass later told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that thieves looking for gold broke 70 objects, including two sculptures of Tutankhamun, and took two skulls from a research lab, before being stopped as they left the museum.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news | last=Taylor|first=Kate | date = 2011 | title= Middle East: Antiquities Chief Says Sites Are Largely Secure | format = online | issue = February 1 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/world/middleeast/02antiquities.html | accessdate= 25 January 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | quote = "A vast majority of Egypt’s museums and archaeological sites are secure and have not been looted, Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s chief antiquities official, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.

He was appointed Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, a newly created cabinet post, by Mubarak on January 31, 2011 as part of a cabinet shake-up during the [[2011 Egyptian protests]].&lt;ref name="Lawler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hawass-update"/&gt;{{dead link|date=January 2016}} A press release including a statement from Hawass stated that he "will continue excavating, writing books, and representing his country,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/pdfs/Press_release_01-02-2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411225841/http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/pdfs/Press_release_01-02-2011.pdf |archive-date=April 11, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ensuring that archaeological sites in Egypt were being safeguarded and looted objects returned.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Regarding the Egyptian Museum looting, he said that "The museum was dark and the nine robbers did not recognise the value of what was in the vitrines.

===Return of artifacts to Egypt===
Hawass spearheaded a movement to return many prominent unique and/or irregularly taken [[Ancient Egyptian]] artifacts, such as the [[Rosetta Stone]], the [[Nefertiti Bust|bust of Nefertiti]], the [[Dendera zodiac]] ceiling painting from the [[Dendera]] Temple, the [[Ankhhaf (sculpture)|bust]] of [[Ankhhaf]] (the architect of the [[Khafra]] [[Pyramid of Khafre|Pyramid]]), the faces of [[Amenhotep III]]'s [[WV22|tomb]] at the [[Louvre Museum]], the [[Luxor Obelisk|Luxor Temple's obelisk]] at the [[Place de la Concorde]] and the statue of [[Hemiunu]], nephew of the Pharaoh Khufu, builder of the largest pyramid, to Egypt from collections in various other countries. In July 2003 the Egyptians requested the return of the Rosetta Stone from the [[British Museum]]. Hawass, as Secretary General of the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] in [[Cairo]], told the press, "If the British want to be remembered, if they want to restore their reputation, they should volunteer to return the Rosetta Stone because it is the icon of our Egyptian identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Charlotte Edwardes|author2=Catherine Milner|last-author-amp=yes|title=Egypt demands return of the Rosetta Stone|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=July 20, 2003|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/1436606/Egypt-demands-return-of-the-Rosetta-Stone.html|accessdate =August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henry Huttinger|title = Stolen Treasures: Zahi Hawass wants the Rosetta Stone back, among other things|work=Cairo Magazine|date=July 28, 2005|url=http://www.cairomagazine.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=1238&amp;format=html|accessdate=October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to antiquities at the British Museum, Hawass said “These are Egyptian monuments.

Alex Joffe of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' expressed the opinion that the looting of antiquities during the [[2011 Egyptian protests|2011 civil unrest]] in Egypt made Hawass' quest to return Egyptian antiquities to Egypt "misguided or at least poorly timed."&lt;ref name="Joffe"/&gt;

===DNA testing of Egyptian mummies===
Hawass has been skeptical of the DNA testing of Egyptian mummies, "From what I understand," he has said, "it is not always accurate and it cannot always be done with complete success when dealing with mummies. Until we know for sure that it is accurate, we will not use it in our research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tutankhamunexhibition.com/tutankhamun-blog/2010/02/17/dna-identifies-tutankhamuns-parents/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530114926/http://www.tutankhamunexhibition.com/tutankhamun-blog/2010/02/17/dna-identifies-tutankhamuns-parents/ |archivedate=May 30, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000, a joint team from [[Waseda University]] in Japan and Cairo's [[Ain Shams University]] tried to get permission for DNA testing of Egyptian [[mummy|mummies]], but was denied by the [[Egyptian Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=99437&amp;page=1|title=DNA Tests Halted on King Tut's Mummy|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=January 7, 2006|website=ABC News|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawass stated at the time that DNA analysis was out of the question because it would not lead to anything.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptologyonline.com/using_dna.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214080708/http://www.egyptologyonline.com/using_dna.htm |date=December 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Hawass and his team announced that they had analyzed the mummies of [[Tutankhamun]] and ten other mummies and said that the king could have died from a malaria infection that followed a leg fracture.&lt;ref name=RobertsBBC10&gt;{{cite journal | last = Roberts | first = Michelle | date = 2010 | title= 'Malaria and Weak Bones' May Have Killed Tutankhamun | journal = [[BBC News]] | format = online | volume = | issue = February 16 | doi = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8516425.stm | accessdate= 25 January 2016 | quote = "The Egyptian "boy king" Tutankhamun may well have died of malaria after the disease ravaged a body crippled by a rare bone disorder, experts say. / The findings could lay to rest conspiracy theories of murder. [Announcement of results only; no scientific journal referenced." }}&lt;/ref&gt; German researchers Christian Timmann and Christian Meyer have cast doubt on this theory, suggesting other possible alternatives for Tutankhamun's cause of death.&lt;ref name=TimmannMeyerTMIH10&gt;{{cite journal | author = Timmann, Christian | author2 = Christian G.

We are sceptical towards this elucidation of the cause of death… and discuss alternative and differential diagnoses, among them, …sickle cell disease and Gauche’s disease." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a study signed by Hawass disclosed that [[Ramses III]] had a haplogroup that is associated with the [[Bantu expansion]] and is the most dominant in Sub-Saharan Africa, [[E1b1a]].&lt;ref name=HawassZinkBMJ12&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hawass, Zahi | author2 = Somaia Ismail | author3 =  Ashraf Selim | author4 =  Sahar N.

During the mummification process, a Horus eye amulet was inserted in the wound for healing purposes, and the neck was covered by a collar of thick linen layers. / Forensic examination of unknown man E showed compressed skin folds around his neck and a thoracic inflation. Unknown man E also had an unusual mummification procedure. According to genetic analyses, both mummies had identical haplotypes of the Y chromosome and a common male lineage. / Conclusions This study suggests that Ramesses III was murdered during the harem conspiracy by the cutting of his throat. Unknown man E is a possible candidate as Ramesses III’s son Pentawere. … [Specifically] Genetic kinship analyses revealed identical haplotypes in both mummies… using the Whit Athey’s haplogroup predictor, we determined the Y chromosomal haplogroup [to be] E1b1a." | pmid=23247979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and awards==
Hawass is the recipient of the Egyptian state award of the first degree for his work in the Sphinx restoration project.&lt;ref name=alahram/&gt; In 2002, he was awarded the American Academy of Achievements' Golden Plate and the glass obelisk from US scholars for his efforts to the protection and preservation of Ancient Egyptian monuments.&lt;ref name=alahram/&gt; In 2003, Hawass was given international membership in the Russian Academy for Natural Sciences (RANS),&lt;ref name=alahram/&gt; and in 2006, he was chosen as one of the world's 100 most influential people by ''[[Time magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=alahram&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nevine El Aref|title=He made it in Time|journal=Al Ahram Weekly|date=May 4–10, 2006|volume=793|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/793/eg10.htm|accessdate=January 3, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508032821/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/793/eg10.htm|archivedate=May 8, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Relationships with other archaeologists===
Hawass has been accused of domineering behaviour, forbidding archaeologists to announce their own findings, and courting the media for his own gain after they were denied access to archaeological sites because, according to Hawass, they were too amateurish.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news | last=Waxman | first=Sharon | date = 2005 | title= Art &amp; Design: The Show-Biz Pharaoh of Egypt's Antiquities | format = online | issue = June 13 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/arts/design/the-showbiz-pharaoh-of-egypts-antiquities.html | accessdate= 25 January 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | quote = "The King Tut exhibition set to open on June 16 in Los Angeles, bringing the boy king's treasures to the United States for the first time in a quarter-century, is in just about every sense a reflection of Zahi Hawass, the man who made the show possible. / Dr. Hawass, who controls Egypt's vast archaeological trove as secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, is part Indiana Jones, part P.T. Barnum -- intent on dusting off Egypt's holdings through a mix of entertainment, commerce and archaeology." }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few, however, have said in interviews that some of what Hawass has done for the field was long overdue.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Hawass has typically ignored or dismissed his critics, and when asked about it he indicated that what he does is for the sake of [[Egypt]] and the preservation of its antiquities.&lt;ref name = ParkerNYer09&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Parker, Ian | date = 2009 | title = Letter from Cairo, The Pharaoh: Is Zahi Hawass bad for Egyptology? | format = print, online | issue = November 16 | pages =53–63 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/16/the-pharaoh  | access-date = 25 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Jews and Israel===
Hawass has been a long-standing opponent of normalized relations between Israel and Egypt.&lt;ref name="Slap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1159674.html |title=Egypt antiquities chief: I gave the Zionist enemy a slap in the face |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=March 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331133005/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1159674.html |archivedate=March 31, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009 Hawass wrote in ''[[Al-Sharq Al-Awsat]]'' that "The concept of killing women, children, and elderly people&amp;nbsp;... seems to run in the blood of the Jews of Palestine" and that "the only thing that the Jews have learned from history is methods of tyranny and torment&amp;nbsp;— so much so that they have become artists in this field."  He explained that he was not referring to the Jews' "[original] faith" but rather "the faith that they forged and contaminated with their poison, which is aimed against all of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.memritv.org/report/en/3213.htm |title=The Middle East Media Research Institute |publisher=Memritv |date= |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on Egyptian television in April 2009 Hawass stated that "although Jews are few in number, they control the entire world" and commented on the "control they have" of the American economy and the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/04/20/the-jews-secret-weapon-bickering.aspx ]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/2049.htm?auth=5bbfe6252b977abf4f8cb54219acbdb |title=MEMRI: Renowned Egyptian Archeologist Zahi Hawass: Jews Control the Entire World |publisher=Memritv.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/2049.htm |title=Clip Transcript |publisher=Memritv.org |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that he was using rhetoric to explain political fragmentation among the Arabs and that he does not believe in a "Jewish conspiracy to control the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drhawass.com/blog/clarification-remarks-jewish-history ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129064750/http://www.drhawass.com/blog/clarification-remarks-jewish-history |date=November 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath of 2011 protests===
Criticism of Hawass, in Egypt and more broadly, increased following the protests in Egypt in 2011. On July 12, 2011, ''The New York Times'' reported on a story on page A1 that Hawass receives an honorarium each year "of as much as $200,000 from [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] to be an explorer-in-residence even as he controls access to the ancient sites it often features in its reports."&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"&gt;{{cite news | last=Taylor | first=Kate | date = 2011 | title= Middle East: Revolution Dims Star Power of Egypt's Antiquities Chief | format = print, online | page = A1ff | issue = July 12 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/arts/design/the-showbiz-pharaoh-of-egypts-antiquities.html | accessdate= 25 January 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | quote = "Until recently Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s antiquities minister, was a global symbol of Egyptian national pride. A famous archaeologist in an Indiana Jones hat, he was virtually unassailable in the old Egypt, protected by his success in boosting tourism, his efforts to reclaim lost artifacts and his closeness to the country’s first lady, Suzanne Mubarak. / But the revolution changed all that. / Now demonstrators in Cairo are calling for his resignation as the interim government faces disaffected crowds in Tahrir Square." }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' also reported that he has relationships with two American companies that do business in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"/&gt;

On April 17, 2011, Hawass was sentenced to jail for one year for refusing to obey a court ruling&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt; relating to a contract for the gift shop at the [[Egyptian Museum]] to a company with links to Hawass.&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"/&gt; The ruling was appealed and this specific sentence was suspended pending appeal.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/201141720122512511.html |title=Egypt antiquities chief faces jail time - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the National Council of Egypt’s Administrative Court issued a decree to overturn the court's original ruling, specifying that he would serve no jail time, and would instead remain in his position as Minister of Antiquities.&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drhawass.com/blog/decision-court-case-against-me] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103163004/http://www.drhawass.com/blog/decision-court-case-against-me |date=January 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jail sentence was lifted after a new contract was solicited for the running of the gift shop.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Association with Mubarak===
As its Minister of Antiquities, Hawass has been closely associated with the government of former President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. His resignation as minister on March 3, 2011 and his re-appointment to the Ministry on March 30, 2011 have been seen as part of the overall events surrounding Mubarak's resignation. It has been reported that his re-appointment has angered numerous factions, who have opposed the appointment of any of the old guard under Mubarak to new positions in the government.&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=214426|title=Breaking News |work=Jerusalem Post|date=March 30, 2011|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2011 Egyptian protests]] resulted in increased criticism of Hawass. Demonstrators called for his resignation, and the upheaval has increased attention on his relationship with the Mubarak family and the way in which he has increased his public profile in recent years.&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"/&gt;

===Commercial endeavours===
Hawass has lent his name to a line of men's apparel, described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "a line of rugged khakis, denim shirts and carefully worn leather jackets that are meant, according to the catalog copy, to hark "back to Egypt’s golden age of discovery in the early 20th century"; the clothing was first sold at [[Harrods]] department store in London, in April 2011.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Taylor | first = Kate | date = 2011 | title= Art &amp; Design: Using History to Sell Clothes? Don’t Try It With the Pharaohs | format = online | issue = April 18 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/arts/design/egyptian-antiquities-official-defends-fashion-line.html | accessdate= 25 January 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | quote = "Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s longtime chief antiquities official, has been criticized in recent months for many things: his closeness to former President Hosni Mubarak, some inconsistent reports on the safety of archaeological sites during the uprising and for his role in a dispute over an Egyptian museum bookstore, for which he now possibly faces jail time. / But the source of the latest controversy to beset Mr. Hawass resembles something straight from the mouth of J. Peterman, the character on 'Seinfeld' based on the clothing catalog retailer of the same name. / Mr. Hawass has lent his name to a men’s wear brand: a line of rugged khakis, denim shirts and carefully worn leather jackets that are meant, according to the catalog copy, to hark 'back to Egypt’s golden age of discovery in the early 20th century.' "}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say the Hawass clothing commercializes Egyptian history, and objected to their understanding that "models had sat on or scuffed priceless ancient artifacts during the photo shoot," an accusation that was denied by Hawass and the clothing manufacturers.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt; Hawass already sells a line of Stetson hats reproducing the ones he wears, which "very much resemble" the ones worn by [[Harrison Ford]] in the ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' movies.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt;
