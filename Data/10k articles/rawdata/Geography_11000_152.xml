The '''A342''' is an [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] in England that runs from [[Pewsham]] near [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]] to [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]], [[Hampshire]].

The road begins at the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4]] junction just outside the small village of [[Pewsham]], to the east of Chippenham. It heads south past the village of [[Derry Hill]] towards [[Devizes]], briefly meeting the [[A3102 road|A3102]] near [[Sandy Lane, Wiltshire|Sandy Lane]].  Just outside Devizes the road meets the [[A361 road|A361]], and once in the centre of town it meets the [[A360 road|A360]].  Continuing southeast in the [[Vale of Pewsey]], under the northern slope of [[Salisbury Plain]], the road reaches [[Upavon]] where it meets the [[A345 road|A345]] and turns east, over the Plain.  After passing through [[Everleigh, Wiltshire|Everleigh]] the road meets the [[A338 road|A338]] before entering [[Ludgershall, Wiltshire|Ludgershall]] and meeting the [[A3026 road|A3026]].  The final part of the route travels southeast where the road ends at a roundabout with the [[A343 road|A343]] and [[A303 road|A303]] just outside Andover.

The '''Appalachian Plateau''' is a series of rugged [[dissected plateau|dissected plateaus]] located on the western side of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The Appalachian Mountains are a mountain range that run down the entire east coast of the United States. 
The Appalachian Plateau is the northwestern part of the Appalachian Mountains, stretching from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Alabama]].  The plateau is a second level [[United States physiographic region]], covering parts of the states of New York, [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], [[Maryland]], [[West Virginia]], [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Alabama]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

== Geography and physiography ==
The formation of the plateau began during the [[Paleozoic|Paleozoic Era.]] Regional uplift during this time caused the area to rise altogether without changing the topography of the land. The eastern side of the plateau appears as a mountain range. This false appearance is due to a very steep slope on the eastern side known as the [[Allegheny Front]]. The eastern edge is the highest part of the Appalachian Plateau. In [[Pennsylvania]], the altitude ranges from 1,750 to 3,000 feet and continues to rise toward [[West Virginia]], where the elevation is around 4,800 feet. From [[West Virginia]] to [[Tennessee]], the elevation lowers to 3,000 feet and continues slanting downward to 1,000 feet in [[Alabama]]. On the western side of the plateau, the elevation is 900 feet in [[Ohio]], increasing to about 2,000 feet in [[Kentucky]]. From [[Kentucky]] the elevation drops down to 500 feet in northwestern [[Alabama]]. The plateau has a slight slant towards the northwest, making it higher on the eastern side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soilinfo.psu.edu/index.cgi?soil_land&amp;us_soil_survey&amp;map&amp;pa&amp;Centre&amp;gen_info&amp;physiography.html|title=Soil Information for Environmental Modeling and Ecosystem Management|last=|first=|date=4 March 1999|website=|publisher=PA Soil Landscapes|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of the plateau is a coalfield, which was formed approximately 320 million years ago during the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/cs/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_009577.pdf|title=Appalachian Region: Multi-State Priority Area|last=|first=|date=16 October 2009|website=|publisher=Appendix 5K|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plateau was subjected to glaciation during the [[Quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]]. As a result, the topography of this section of the plateau is relatively flat in comparison to the rest of the physiographic province. This portion of the plateau is marked with evidence of a glaciated past including [[bog]]s, lakes, and small hills of sand and gravel. The topography of the rest of the plateau was created mainly from stream [[erosion]]. The result is a rugged landscape, unlike many other plateaus, that includes many narrow stream valleys surrounded by steep ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quarriesandbeyond.org/articles_and_books/min_res_appalachian_region/physiography.html|title=Physiography|last=Davies|first=William|date=|website=|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physiographic regions ===
A [[Physiographic regions of the world|physiographic region]] is a large portion of land that is grouped together by several factors. Each region has similar geology, [[topography]], and groups of plants and animals. There are eight physiographic regions in the [[United States]]. Each region is divided into provinces, there are 25 provinces in the United States. Each region is then divided into sections, creating 85 different physio-graphic sections in the United States. The Appalachian Plateau is a province of the physiographic region of the Appalachian Highlands. The Appalachian Plateau province is divided into seven physio-graphic sections: [[Mohawk Mountains|Mohawk]], [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill]], Southern [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Allegheny Mountains]], [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha]], [[Cumberland Plateau]], and the [[Cumberland Mountains]]. Each section is classified under the Appalachian Plateau province because of its similarities in geologic makeup, topography, and wildlife. Likewise, the Appalachian Plateau falls under the classification of Appalachian Highlands because of those similar characteristics.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Geology ==
The rock underlying the Appalachian Plateau consists of a base of [[Precambrian]] rock, overlain by [[sedimentary rock]] from the [[Paleozoic|Paleozoic Era]]. On top of the basement is a thick layer, approximately 20,000 feet, of a mixture of [[Cambrian]], [[Ordovician]], and Middle [[Silurian]] rock. This rock consists of [[shale]], [[siltstone]], and [[sandstone]]. Above this layer is the [[Upper Silurian]] [[evaporate]] [[Basin (geology)|basin]], or basin of chemically formed sedimentary rocks. The Plateau fold belt consists of structurally complex Paleozoic strata which were [[thrust fault]]ed over the younger evaporates.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mount|first=Van S.|title="Structural style of the Appalachian Plateau fold belt, north-central Pennsylvania."|journal=Journal of Structural Geology|volume= 69, December 2014|pages= 284–303|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191814114000790|doi=10.1016/j.jsg.2014.04.005|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Appalachian mountains were formed, the plateau was lifted. Ridges and valleys all die down underneath the plateau. There are multiple valleys throughout the region which consist of exposed areas of limestone and shale.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Child coal miners (1908).jpg|thumb|Child coal miners in Gary, West Virginia, 1908, minding the mules]]

=== Native Americans ===
Archaeologists have evidence that Native Americans lived in the Appalachian region more than twelve thousand years ago; however, it is hard to say exactly when the occupants first inhabited the land. Human artifacts were collected near the [[Meadowcroft Rockshelter]] in southern Pennsylvania that were at least sixteen thousand years old. Because the early Native Americans were hunter-gatherers living off the land, they left little material traces of their lives behind them. This is why it is so hard for researchers to determine when they settled in this area. Much like many historic Native American tribes, the early Appalachian inhabitants survived as nomads, following their food on a seasonal basis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Around this period, North America was still recuperating from its [[last glacial period]], and the climate was much different than now. The climate and habitat more closely resembled a [[tundra]], with lower temperatures, numerous conifer trees, and large mammals, such as mammoths and saber-toothed tigers. Eventually, the climate began to warm up again, the large mammals started to disappear, and the vegetation seen more often today began to flourish. These climatic changes made life more sustainable for the Native Americans. They continued to invent new weapons and made advancements in agriculture until the Europeans arrived in North America.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== European settlement ===
Europeans settled in North America beginning in the seventeenth century. In 1749, Jacob Martin and Steven Sewell were the first Europeans known to settle the Appalachian Plateau, specifically in what is now [[Pocahontas County, West Virginia|Pocahontas County]] in West Virginia. European colonization and competition with the Native Americans resulted in high mortality due to new diseases, as well as more deaths and social disruption due to warfare. After pushing out the Native Americans, the European American settlers developed much of this land for agriculture..&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 1861 to 1865, the Appalachian Plateau suffered from the Civil War, but in comparison to many other parts of the country, little damage was done. During the war, Union forces gained control over a majority of the plateau, and afterwards that possession was not challenged. Only three noteworthy battles occurred in the plateau region during the war, so not much of the land was destroyed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the war, the coal industry boomed. Many counties in the Appalachian Plateau region, such as [[McDowell County, West Virginia|McDowell County]] in West Virginia, became dominated by coal mining. Coal mining towns were created, and many immigrants were attracted to the region for work. Although mining was good for the economy, deaths were high in the harsh work of the mines. Among the terrible coal incidents was the [[Monongah mining disaster]] of 1907.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Natural History of the Central Appalachians|last=Stephenson|first=Steven|publisher=West Virginia University|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=212–220|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protected lands ==
Protecting the Appalachian Region from damage of human influence has been important in the modern era. Conservationists have been fighting to preserve the wildlife in the [[Appalachian Region|Appalachia region]]. The region has proved that with good care, the flora and fauna can be very resilient. However, back in 1890, the destruction of the Appalachian region's forest was at full-scale with the invention of the railroad, saw-mills, and clear-cutting of trees. This caused major flooding and wildfires to the region and destroyed keystone species across the region. Realizing that the destruction of the forest was becoming a major issue, the government passed the [[Weeks Act]] of 1911, which allowed the federal government to purchase private land in order to protect rivers and watersheds in the eastern United States.

The first purchase under this act was the [[Pisgah National Forest|Pisgah National forest]]. In 1964, the [[Wilderness Act]] expanded protections for millions of acres of federal land, such as the [[Shining Rock]] and [[Linville Gorge Wilderness|Linville Gorge]]. The 1975 Eastern Wilderness Act created expanded protected areas in North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee. Today, close to 21% of the region is protected. Conservation groups that are dedicated to preserving the Appalachian Plateau region include the Southern Appalachian Forest Coalition and the Northern Forest Alliance. Ultimately, experts and researchers say the best way to continue protecting the Appalachian region is to incorporate conservation into public education so that people understand and support the benefits of conserving the lands.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, John, Roland Kays, Albert Meier, Susan Andrew, and Kay Yatskievych.

== Wildlife ==
[[File:0 Rhododendron - Celles (Hainaut) 3.JPG|thumb|Rhododenron]]

=== Plants ===
The Appalachian region is home to a wide variety of plant and animal life due to its vast array of climate and conditions giving the Appalachian Plateau region great biodiversity. To the north are many conifers, such as [[red spruce]] and [[balsam fir]] which can be seen growing at the northernmost latitudes of the Appalachian region. In the northern sections of the plateau at lower elevations you can find [[northern hardwoods]], such as [[sugar maple]] and [[white oak]]. In southern Appalachia, growth of [[sycamore]], [[Walnut tree|walnut]], and [[hickory]] trees are common. It is estimated that there is around 2,000 species of flora within the Appalachia region. Flowers vary due to elevation and climate of the area of Appalachia region. Different types of flowers in the northern and southern sections of the Appalachia. Flowers such as [[Rhododendron hancockii|rhododendron]], [[azalea]] and [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] can be found in southern regions while up north trees will bear [[serviceberry]], [[redbud]], [[Oxydendrum|sourwood]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, Steven L. ''A Natural History of the Central Appalachians''. Morgantown: West Virginia UP, 2013. Print. (pg. 30-129)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animals ===
Fauna such as [[bison]] and [[wolves]] used to be native to the Appalachian region but have subsequently vanished. [[Elk]] still are present in some regions. Throughout all of the Appalachian Plateau region there is an abundance of fox, raccoon, wild boar, black bears, white-tailed deer, and beaver. Researchers also found there to be over 200 species of game and song birds including wild turkey, heron, geese, hawks, ducks and many more.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Fungi are also prominent in the Appalachia region. Abundant [[mushroom]] and [[lichen]] can be found including [[chanterelle]], [[oyster mushroom]] and [[rock tripe]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Stephenson, Steven L. ''A Natural History of the Central Appalachians''. Morgantown: West Virginia UP, 2013. Print. (pg. 130-211)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural resources ==
The Appalachian Plateau has a vast array of natural resources throughout its rugged landscape. Within these resources, there are many sedimentary substances. In the valleys of the Appalachian Plateau there is an abundance of [[limestone]]. This limestone is still mined for cement and aggregate. Due to excessive mining over time, limestone fields are depleted in many areas but some are still relatively plentiful. [[Ironstone]] and [[coal]] are also among the plentiful natural resources found. In different regions of the Appalachian Plateau, enough plant debris accumulated to form peat, which upon burial, compaction and heating was made into the coal of the Appalachian coalfields. Due to the abundant coal in the Appalachian Plateau, coal mining has been a staple of the area and has proved to be a very successful mining hub. [[Iron ore]] was once an extremely abundant natural resource but due to the thin layer of iron, over time it was mostly depleted. A very well known natural resource of the Appalachian Plateau is its land and soil. The soil is rich and it is ideal for farmland. Within the limestone found throughout the Appalachian Plateau there are many fossilized substances such as old plant and stems, which may help to explain why the plateau also has a rich amount of natural gases and petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/science-medicine/appalachian-plateau-geologic-province Chowns, Timothy.

== Landmarks and state parks ==
[[File:Great-Smoky-Mountains Panorama.jpg|thumb|Great Smoky Mountains, Tennessee]]
The Appalachian Plateau has many landmarks and public spaces to camp out, go hiking, and sight see. The [[Cloudland Canyon State Park]] is a prominent landmark in the Appalachian Plateau. At 3,485 acres, the [[Cloudland Canyon State Park]] is one of the largest and most scenic parks throughout the Appalachian Plateau. Its rugged geology offers a wide range of activities for tourists and campers to take part in. Spacious views of the canyon can be seen anywhere from the midst of the trail, to picnic tables at resting areas.

Another well-known landmark in the Appalachian Plateau is [[Great Smoky Mountains|The Great Smoky Mountains]]. The Smoky Mountains are an estimated 187,000 acres and consist of old growth forests. The name “Smoky” comes from the natural fog that sometimes hangs over the mountain range and looks like a cloud of smoke from a distance. The [[Hocking Hills]] are deeply dissected in the Appalachian Plateau area. The hills themselves feature cliffs, gorges, waterfalls and even rock shelters. It is a very historic landmark and many tourists along with campers and hikers come to see the beauty and serenity of the hills. The hills are known to be thick, hard and weather resistant, which in turn builds deep gorges and very high cliffs.

'''Baltic Compass''' is a transnational project which aims to reinforce connection between [[landuse]], [[Environmental policy|environment]] and [[agriculture]], leading to healthier ecosystems and a more competitive [[Baltic Sea]] region. The name Baltic Compass comes from the letters from the whole name of the project: '''Com'''prehensive '''P'''olicy '''A'''ctions and Investments in '''S'''ustainable '''S'''olutions in Agriculture in the Baltic Sea Region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balticcompass.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==From blooming Baltic Sea to a blooming Baltic Region==
Baltic Compass aims to find ways how the agricultural sector in the Baltic Sea Region can produce the daily food required by the region’s 90 million inhabitants and at the same time preserve the Baltic Sea. The large catchment area and the shallowness and enclosedness of the Baltic Sea make it very vulnerable. The Baltic Sea has 9 riparian countries and therefore close [[Internationalism (politics)|international cooperation]] as well as sectoral cooperation is needed in order to move towards healthier [[ecosystems]] in the whole Baltic Sea Region. Baltic Compass aims to reduce [[euthrophication]] through transnational approach, by increasing cooperation between the environmental and agricultural sectors in the Baltic Sea region.

==Project background==

Baltic Compass is a Pan Baltic project with the 22 partners. They represent national authorities, interest organizations and innovation centres in [[Belarus]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Russia]] (associated partner). Baltic Compass will thus function as a regional platform where participants and stakeholders can develop more efficient agro-environmental policies, share innovations and best practises, create scientific scenarios and facilitate investments. Baltic Compass fosters win-win solutions for agriculture and environment and thus leads to more [[sustainable]] rural economies.  

The expectations on Baltic Compass is to contribute with sharing of practical solutions and innovations (web portal), business and investment facilitation (advice and networking), strategic risk assessment concerned with land use and animal husbandry (science and scenarios) and the policy adaptation required (political and ministerial level dialogue). The concrete benefit for the farmers will be better access to decision support when investing for future businesses in the sensitive Baltic ecosystems – independently in which Baltic Sea Region country. 

Baltic Compass is regarded as a strategic level project by the financier the '''[[Baltic Sea Region Programme]] 2007-2013''' for its contributions to investments and policy environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://eu.baltic.net/&lt;/ref&gt; The project will in a practical manner encompass the political ideas of the [[HELCOM]] Baltic Sea Action Plan and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helcom.fi/&lt;/ref&gt;  Baltic Compass will run from December 2009 to December 2012.

As of 2011, [[Gabon]] contains 152 Cantons, 52 Communes, 29 Arrondissements, and 26 Districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gabsoli.org/gabon/gabonbref.html |title=Le Gabon en statistiques |publisher=Gabsoli.org |accessdate=27 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331083223/http://www.gabsoli.org/gabon/gabonbref.html |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; These are the third-level administrative units of Gabon and between them make up the units of the [[Departments of Gabon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geohive.com/cntry/gabon.aspx|title=Gabon|publisher=Direction Generale de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques, Gabon, published by Geohive|accessdate=27 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906035204/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/gabon.aspx#|archive-date=2011-09-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrondissements tend to be units of major cities such as [[Libreville]] and communes are generally seated in the main cities and towns and incorporating the surrounding rural area. The cantons of Gabon are largely rural in nature with a small town or large village as the main centre.

To address anticipated population growth of more than 2 million new residents, GO TO 2040 establishes coordinated strategies that help the region's 284 communities address transportation, housing, economic development, open space, the environment, and other quality-of-life issues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.cmap.illinois.gov Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) website].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the summer of 2005, [http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2731&amp;ChapAct=70%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B1707%2F&amp;ChapterID=15&amp;ChapterName=SPECIAL+DISTRICTS&amp;ActName=Regional+Planning+Act Public Act 094-0510] called for the creation of a new Regional Planning Board to merge operations of the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) and the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission (NIPC).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Chicago Tribune, "[[Seven-county planning board launches]]," October 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  For 50 years, CATS had been responsible for regional transportation planning as the federally designated [[Metropolitan Planning Organization]] (MPO) for the [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago region]], and over the same period, NIPC was responsible for regional land-use planning. In 2006, the new organization was named the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and submitted a legislatively mandated [https://web.archive.org/web/20130916165542/http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=f1b7c91f-a644-4db9-9dce-b3f3dea5bfce&amp;groupId=20583 strategic report] to the Governor and General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;CMAP [[Strategic Report on Vision, Governance, and Funding]], September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Development of the comprehensive regional plan began in September 2007, with development of a regional vision.  It continued through two years of research that culminated in 2009 with extensive public outreach that coincided with the centennial of Daniel Burnham's 1909 ''Plan of Chicago''.  The resulting "preferred regional scenario" published in January 2010 preceded release of the draft plan for comment in May 2010.  And the final GO TO 2040 plan was adopted unanimously by leaders from across the seven counties on October 13, 2010, at which point the agency's efforts shifted to implementation of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;GO TO 2040 [http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/process-archive process archive].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/news/newsroom-archive/-/blogs/cmap-media-coverage-10-6-to-10-19-10 Media coverage of GO TO 2040 adoption], October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, CMAP began development of a successor plan called ON TO 2050, which is scheduled for adoption in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;ON TO 2050[http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/about/2050.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and Responsibilities==
Gerald R. Bennett (mayor of Palos Hills, Illinois) chairs the CMAP Board, whose membership features balanced representation from across the seven counties to reflect the regional consensus that led to creation of CMAP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/about About CMAP] web page.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to its authorizing legislation, CMAP operates under a set of by-laws.&lt;ref&gt;[[CMAP by-laws]], revised November 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Led by executive director [[Joseph C. Szabo]], the CMAP staff have diverse capabilities in comprehensive planning, data research and analysis, and many related disciplines.  CMAP has committees at the policy, advisory, coordinating, and working levels that play integral roles in the agency's planning processes.&lt;ref&gt;CMAP [http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/board-and-committees committees pages].&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of Illinois legislation that created CMAP gave the agency the task of integrating the previously separate topics of land use and transportation into one agency that would protect natural resources, improve mobility, and minimize traffic congestion in the seven-county region.  Under federal [[Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act|MAP-21]] legislation, CMAP is responsible for developing the region's official transportation plan, part of the broader ON TO 2050 comprehensive plan that integrates transportation with land use, housing, economic development, open space, the environment, and other quality-of-life issues.  This transportation plan must be updated every four years, use visualization techniques, engage the general public, and include a separate Transportation Improvement Program document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=US DOT, FHWA|title=Fact Sheets on Highway Provisions|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/factsheets/mp.htm|accessdate=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ON TO 2050 Comprehensive Regional Plan==
CMAP and its partners developed and are now implementing the [http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/onto2050 ON TO 2050] comprehensive regional plan, which was adopted on October 10, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/onto2050|title=ON TO 2050 - CMAP|website=www.cmap.illinois.gov|access-date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The launch of the plan's development was featured by WTTW television in the February 23, 2016 edition of Chicago Tonight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/2365674868/|title=WTTW feature about CMAP ON TO 2050 plan|last=Baer|first=Geoffrey|date=February 23, 2016|work=|access-date=August 27, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During April-August 2017, CMAP engaged residents and stakeholder groups who were invited to comment on five "[http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/onto2050/futures Alternative Futures]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/onto2050/futures|title=ON TO 2050 Alternative Futures|website=www.cmap.illinois.gov|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The public can also provide feedback about ON TO 2050 topics being studied for [http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/next-plan/strategy-papers Strategy Papers] and [http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/next-plan/snapshot-reports Snapshot Reports] currently in development.  Since 2010, the agency's activities have focused primarily on support for the implementation of GO TO 2040.

[[File:Paraguay map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Paraguay map of Köppen climate classification.]]
The '''climate of Paraguay''' consists of a [[subtropical climate]] in the [[Paraná Basin|Paranaense]] region and a [[tropical climate]] in the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]]. The Paranaense region has a humid climate, with abundant precipitation throughout the year and only moderate seasonal changes in temperature.

During summer, the dominant influence on the climate is the warm [[sirocco]] winds blowing out of the northeast.

During the winter, the dominant wind is the cold ''[[Pampero (wind)|pampero]]'' from the South Atlantic, which blows across [[Argentina]] and is deflected northeastward by the [[Andes]] in the southern part of that country. Because of the lack of topographic barriers within Paraguay, these opposite [[prevailing winds]] bring about abrupt and irregular changes in the usually moderate weather. Winds are generally brisk. Velocities of {{convert|160|kph}} have been reported in southern locations, and the town of [[Encarnación, Paraguay|Encarnación]] was once leveled by a [[tornado]].

==Paranaense region==
The [[Paraná Basin|Paranaense]] region has only two distinct seasons: summer from October to March and winter from May to August.  In transitional months of April and September, temperatures below the midsummer averages include nocturnal minima that may dip below freezing.

=== Winter ===
During July, the coldest month of the subtropical winter, temperature averages about {{convert|17.87|C}} in [[Asunción]] and slightly cooler on the [[Paraná Plateau]].  Temperature varies only insignificantly with latitude.  The number of days with temperatures falling below freezing ranges from as few as 3 to as many as 16 yearly, and with even wider variations deep in the interior. Some very mild winters with winds blowing constantly from the north feature little frost.

During a cold winter, however, tongues of Antarctic air bring subfreezing temperatures to all areas. No part of the Paranaense region is entirely free from the possibility of frost and consequent damage to crops, and various locations report snow flurries occasionally.

=== Summer ===
Moist tropical air keeps the weather warm in the Paranaense region from October through March. In Asunción the temperature averages about {{Convert|27.96|C}} during January, the warmest month.

During the summer, daytime temperatures fairly commonly reach {{Convert|38|C}}. Frequent waves of cool air from the south, however, cause weather that alternates between clear, humid conditions and storms.

=== Precipitation===

Fairly evenly distributed rain falls in the Paranaense region.  Although local meteorological conditions play a contributing role, rain usually falls in dominant tropical air masses. The least rain falls in August, when averages in various parts of the region range from {{Convert|100|mm}} to {{Convert|200|mm}}.  The two periods of maximum precipitation are March through May and October to November.

For the region as a whole, the difference between the driest and the wettest months ranges from {{Convert|100|mm}} to {{Convert|180|mm}}.  The annual average rainfall is {{Convert|1270|mm}}, although the average on the Paraná Plateau is {{Convert|250|mm}} to {{Convert|380|mm}} greater. All subregions may experience considerable variations from year to year. Asunción has recorded as much as {{Convert|208|mm}} and as little as {{Convert|560|mm}} of annual rainfall; [[Puerto Bertoni]] on the Paraná Plateau has recorded as much as {{Convert|3300|mm}} and as little as {{Convert|790|mm}}.

==Chaco==
In contrast to the Paranaense region, the Chaco has a tropical wet-and-dry climate bordering on [[semi-arid]]. The Chaco experiences seasons that alternately flood and parch the land, yet seasonal variations in temperature are modest. Chaco temperatures are usually high, the averages dropping only slightly in winter. Even at night the air is stifling despite the usually present breezes. Rainfall is light, varying from 500 to 1,000 millimeters (19.7 to 39.4 in) per year, except in the higher land to the northwest where it is somewhat greater. Rainfall is concentrated in the summer months, and extensive areas that are [[deserts]] in winter become summer swamps.

The '''Coral Reef Alliance''' (CORAL) is a [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], that partners with local reef communities around the world to protect [[coral reefs]].  CORAL was founded in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California, in 1994 by Stephen Colwell,&lt;ref name=dailycal&gt;

organizations like CORAL are addressing an urgent need.

==History==
The organization was founded in 1994 by Stephen Colwell in Berkeley, California. In the beginning, the goal was simple: to engage the diving community in coral reef conservation. Today, CORAL's mission of uniting communities to save coral reefs has dramatically broadened the scope of its work and has provided extensive opportunities to have an even greater impact around the globe.

In 1995 CORAL started their first website to help expand coral reef communication and news. Shortly after they partnered with the Palau Conservation Society (grant of $72,000) to support protection of Rock Island Marine Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CORAL's Historical Timeline|url=http://www.coral.org/who_we_are/about_the_organization/timeline|publisher=Coral Reef Alliance|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year or two Colwell decided to start a membership program to increase charitable income to help with different activities around the globe. In 1997 the Coral Reef Alliance was selected to appear in a 30-minute [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary entitled The Visionaries, filmed on [[Palau|Palau Island]], Micronesia. The show documented CORAL's work to promote coral reef conservation and was distributed to 175 television markets across the country to be aired four times throughout each market. In 1999, CORAL became a founding member of the International Coral Reef Action Network (ICRAN), a coalition formed to implement the international Coral Reef Initiative Framework for Action. In 2002, CORAL expanded its focus to building strong marine protected areas to restore coral reefs worldwide. In 2005, it completed design of its new approach, the Coral Reef Sustainable Destination (CRSD) model, which is still used today and is increasingly validated by the scientific community.

==Organization==
The Coral Reef Alliance or CORAL is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization.&lt;ref name="Financials"&gt;{{cite web|title=Financials|url=http://www.coral.org/who_we_are/about_the_organization/financials|publisher=Coral Reef Alliance|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They depend on the support of individual donors, foundations, and corporate and government grants to build grassroots conservation partnerships among local community members, government leaders, and marine recreation providers in coral reef destinations around the world.&lt;ref name="Financials"/&gt; Many of CORAL's employees are stationed in [[Hawaii]] and around the world in countries such as [[Indonesia]], [[Fiji]], [[Honduras]], and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where We Work|url=http://www.coral.org/where_we_work|publisher=Coral Reef Alliance|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
CORAL promotes conservation through its Coral Reef Sustainable Destination (CRSD) approach, a holistic model that combines marine protected area (MPA) management and sustainable business operation for community benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do|url=http://www.coral.org/what_we_do|publisher=Coral Reef Alliance|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dana Biosphere Reserve was founded in 1989&lt;ref name=rscn /&gt; in the area in and around the [[Dana, Jordan|Dana village]] and Wadi Dana comprising {{convert|308|km2|sqmi|0}}.&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;

==Human presence==
The people of the Ata'ta (or Al Atata) tribe are the native inhabitants&lt;ref name=eco&gt;{{cite book|title=Jordan Eco &amp; Nature|publisher=Jordan Tourism Board, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Dana Biosphere Reserve. Their history in Dana dates 400 years, but their original settlement in the area dates more than 6000 years.&lt;ref name=eco /&gt; Besides the presence of the Ata'ta people, archeological discoveries suggest Palaeolithic, Egyptian, Nabataean, and Roman settlement in Dana.&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;

==Accommodations==
Visitors to Dana Nature Reserve and Dana village can stay at Dana Cooperative Hotel and other accommodations.&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;

==Geography==
Dana Biosphere Reserve drops from an altitude of {{convert|1500|m|ft}} on the Qadisiyah plateau to the low-lying desert area of [[Wadi Araba]].&lt;ref name=rscn /&gt; The varied geology of Dana contains [[limestone]], [[sandstone]], and [[granite]]. The area of Wadi Dana features wind-cut [[sandstone]] cliffs. Dana is the only nature reserve in Jordan that crosses four bio-geographical zones; Mediterranean, Irano-Turanian, Saharo-Arabian, and Sudanian penatration.&lt;ref name=rscn /&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
The diverse environment of Dana is home to 703 [[plant]] species, 215 species of [[birds]], and 38 species of [[mammals]].&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;

===Plants===
Dana is the most diverse area of plant life in the country, consisting of numerous vegetation types including: Phoenician juniper, evergreen oak, sand dunes, acacia, and rocky sudanian.&lt;ref name=rscn /&gt; Dana is the southernmost area in the world to host the Mediterranean cypress, ''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]''. Of the hundreds of plants species inhabiting Dana, three can be found nowhere else in the world. Many plants, especially trees and shrubs, grow in the highlands of the nature reserve.&lt;ref name=rscn /&gt;

===Endangered species===
The threatened [[Nubian ibex]], Syrian serin, caracal, and lesser [[kestrel]] are natives of Wadi Dana and plans to save the species were put forth by [[Global Environment Fund]] in 1994. Additionally, the largest breeding colony of the [[Syrian serin]] is in Dana Nature Reserve. Threats to the animals include hunting.&lt;ref name=rscn /&gt;

The '''Drakensberg''' ([[Afrikaans]]: Drakensberge, [[Zulu language|Zulu]]: uKhahlamba, [[Sotho language|Sotho]]: Maluti) is the name given to the eastern portion of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]], which encloses the central [[South Africa#Geography|Southern African]] plateau. The Great Escarpment reaches its greatest elevation in this region – {{convert|2000|to|3482|m|ft|abbr=off}}. It is located in [[South Africa]] and [[Lesotho]].

[[File:The Escarpment and the Drakensberg.jpg|thumb|300 px|A map of South Africa showing the central plateau edged by the Great Escarpment and its relationship to the [[Cape Fold Mountains]] to the south. The portion of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] shown in red is known as the Drakensberg.]]

The Drakensberg escarpment stretches for over {{convert|1000|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} from the [[Eastern Cape|Eastern Cape Province]] in the South, then successively forms, in order from south to north, the border between [[Lesotho]] and the [[Eastern Cape]] and the border between Lesotho and [[KwaZulu-Natal|KwaZulu-Natal Province]]. Thereafter it forms the border between KwaZulu-Natal and the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]], and next as  the border between KwaZulu-Natal and [[Mpumalanga|Mpumalanga Province]]. It winds north, through Mpumalanga, where it includes features such as the [[Blyde River Canyon]], [[Three Rondavels]] and [[God's Window]]. It moves north again above [[Tzaneen]] in [[Limpopo|Limpopo Province]], where it includes the [[Wolkberg]] [[Mountains]] and Iron Crown Mountain, at {{convert|2200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, the Wolkberg being the highest mountain range in Limpopo. It veers west again and at [[Mokopane]] it is known as the Strydpoort Mountains.&lt;ref name= "Atlas"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reader's Digest Atlas of Southern Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJPctAEACAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Reader's Digest Association South Africa|pages=13, 190–192|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1975); ''Micropaedia'' Vol. III, p. 655. Helen Hemingway Benton Publishers, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The [[Afrikaans]] name ''Drakensberge'' comes from the name the earliest [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settlers to the region gave it. They called them the ''Drakensbergen'', or "'''Mountains of Dragons'''". Several possible reasons for this name include the pointy tops giving an appearance similar to that of the back of the mythical [[European dragon]], old local myths of dragons roaming the mountains, and possible findings of [[dinosaur]] [[fossils]] (which would have been confused with the remains of dragons).&lt;ref name="visi_Drak"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Drakensbergen in Kwazulu-Natal | trans-title =  | author =  | work = visitafricanow.com | date =  | accessdate = 2018-04-26 | url = http://www.visitafricanow.com/zuid-afrika/Kwazulu%20Natal/kw_n_drakenb.php | language = nl  | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When most South Africans and visitors speak of ''the'' Drakensberg, they refer to the Great Escarpment that forms the border between Lesotho and KwaZulu-Natal, believing it to be a range of mountains extending into Lesotho, more correctly known as the [[Lesotho Highlands]]. This highest portion of the Great Escarpment is known as ''uKhahlamba'' ("Barrier of up-pointed spears")&lt;ref name=Pearse&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearse|first=Reg O.|title=Barrier of Spears: Drama of the Drakensberg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ri6KQgAACAAJ|year=1973|publisher=H. Timmins|isbn=978-0-86978-050-3|page=i}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and ''Maluti'' in [[Sotho language|Sotho]].

== Geological origins ==

About 180 million years ago, a [[mantle plume]] under southern [[Gondwana]] caused bulging of the continental crust in the area that would later become southern Africa.&lt;ref name=mccarthy&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCarthy|first1=Terence |last2=Rubidge|first2=Bruce |title=The Story of Earth &amp; Life: A Southern Africa Perspective on a 4.6 Billion-year Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEa9tNO2qOcC|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Random House South Africa|isbn=978-1-77007-148-3|pages=16–7, 192–195, 245–248, 263, 267–269|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within 10–20 million years [[rift valley]]s formed on either side of the central bulge, which became flooded to become the proto-Atlantic and proto-Indian oceans.&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt;&lt;ref name=truswell&gt;{{cite book|last=Truswell|first=J. F. |title=The Geological Evolution of South Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gq0AAAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Alice Kelly Purnell|location=Cape Town|pages=151–153, 157–159, 184–188, 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stepped steep walls of these rift valleys formed escarpments that surrounded the newly formed Southern African subcontinent.&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt;
With the widening of the Atlantic, Indian and Southern oceans, Southern Africa became tectonically quiescent. Earthquakes rarely occur, and there has been no volcanic or [[Orogeny|orogenic activity]] for about 50&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1975); ''Macropaedia,'' Vol. 17. p. 60. Helen Hemingway Benton Publishers, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; An almost uninterrupted period of erosion has continued to the present, resulting in layers several kilometers thick having been lost from the surface of the plateau.&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt; A thick layer of marine sediment was consequently deposited onto the continental shelf (the lower steps of the original rift valley walls) which surrounds the subcontinent.&lt;ref name=truswell /&gt;

During the past 20 million years, further massive upliftment, especially in the East, has taken place in Southern Africa. As a result, most of the plateau lies above {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} despite the extensive erosion. The plateau is tilted such that its highest point is in the east, and it slopes gently downwards towards the west and south. The elevation of the edge of the eastern escarpments is typically in excess of {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It reaches its highest point (over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}) where the escarpment forms part of the international border between Lesotho and the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Atlas" /&gt;

The upliftment of the central plateau over the past 20&amp;nbsp;million years and erosion resulted in the original escarpment being moved inland, creating the present-day coastal plain.&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt;&lt;ref name= McCarthy&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCARTHY|first1=T.

The rate of the erosion of the escarpment in the Drakensberg region is said to average {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} per 1000&amp;nbsp;years, or {{convert|1.5|mm|in|frac=16}} per year.&lt;ref name=norman /&gt;

Because of the extensive erosion of the plateau, which occurred over most of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, none of its surface rocks (except the Kalahari sands) are younger than 180&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt;&lt;ref name="geological map"&gt;''Geological map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland ''(1970). Council for Geoscience, Geological Survey of South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest rocks that remain cap the plateau in Lesotho. These are the [[Karoo Supergroup#Stormberg group|Clarens Formation]] laid down under desert conditions about 200&amp;nbsp;million years ago, topped by a [[Karoo Supergroup#Drakensberg and Lebombo groups|{{convert|1600|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick layer of lava]] which erupted, and covered most of Southern Africa, and large parts of Gondwana, about 180 million years ago.&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt;&lt;ref name=truswell /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drakensberg Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sycholt|first=August |editor=Roxanne Reid|title=A Guide to the Drakensberg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFo7ytU8OnUC|year=2002|publisher=Struik Publishers|location=Cape Town|isbn=978-1-86872-593-9|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rocks form the steep sides of the Great Escarpment in this region, where its upper edge reaches an elevation in excess of {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

The erosional retreat of the escarpment from the coast to its present position, means that the rocks of the coastal plain are, with very few and small exceptions, older than those that cap the top of the escarpment. Thus the rocks of the Mpumalanga [[Veld|Lowveld]] below the Mpumalanga portion of the Great Escarpment are more than 3000&amp;nbsp;million years old.&lt;ref name="geological map" /&gt; The rocks of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands belong, in the main, to the Beaufort and Ecca Groups (of the [[Karoo Supergroup]]), aged 220–310&amp;nbsp;million years, and are therefore considerably older than the Drakensberg lavas (aged 180&amp;nbsp;million years) which cap the escarpment on the border between KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho.&lt;ref name="geological map" /&gt;

The entire eastern portion of the Great Escarpment (see the accompanying map) constitutes the Drakensberg.&lt;ref name="Atlas" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtBxcgAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Times Books|location=London|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Drakensberg terminate in the north near Tzaneen at about the 22° S parallel. The absence of the Great Escarpment for about {{convert|450|km|abbr=on}} to the north of Tzaneen (to reappear on the border between [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Mozambique]] in the [[Chimanimani]] Highlands) is due to a failed westerly branch of the main rift that caused [[Antarctica]] to start drifting away from Southern Africa during the breakup of Gondwana about 150 million years ago. The lower [[Limpopo River]] and [[Save River (Africa)|Save River]] drain into the [[Indian Ocean]] through what remains of this relict incipient rift valley which now forms part of the [[Veld#Highveld and Lowveld|South African Low veld]].&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt;

== Geomorphology ==

=== Appearance ===

[[File:SW-NE geological cross section through South Africa.jpg|thumb|right|500 px|An approximate SW-NE cross section through South Africa with the [[Cape Peninsula]] (with [[Table Mountain]]) on  the far left, and north-eastern [[KwaZulu-Natal]] on the right. Diagrammatic and only roughly to scale. It shows how the '''Drakensberg Escarpment''' is related to the major geographical features that dominate the southern and eastern parts of the country, particularly the Central Plateau, whose south-western edge (in the diagram) is called the Roggeberg escarpment (not labelled). The major geological layers that shape this geography are indicated in different colors, whose significance and origin are explained under the headings "[[Karoo Supergroup]]" and "[[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Supergroup]]".  The 1600 m thick layer of hard, erosion-resistant basalt (lava) that accounts for the height and steepness of the Drakensberg Escarpment on the KwaZuluNatal-Lesotho border is indicated in blue. Immediately below it is the [[Karoo Supergroup#Stormberg group|Stormberg Group]] shown in green. The Clarence Formation with its numerous caves and San rock paintings,  forms part of this latter group.]]The escarpment seen from below looks like a range of mountains. The Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Lesotho Drakensberg have hard erosion-resistant upper surfaces and therefore have a very rugged appearance, combining steep-sided blocks and pinnacles (giving rise to the Zulu name "Barrier of up-pointed spears"). Who first gave these mountains their Afrikaans or Dutch name ''Drakensberg'', and why, is unknown.&lt;ref name=Pearse /&gt;). The KwaZulu-Natal – Free State Drakensberg are composed of softer rocks and therefore have a more rounded, softer appearance from below. The top of the escarpment is generally almost table-top flat and smooth, even in Lesotho. The "Lesotho Mountains" are formed away from the Drakensberg escarpment by erosion gulleys which turn into deep valleys which contain tributaries of the [[Orange River]]. The large number of tributaries give the [[Geography of Lesotho|Lesotho Highlands]] a very rugged mountainous appearance, both from the ground and from the air.

The higher parts of Drakensberg has a mildly [[periglaciation|periglacial environment]]. It is possible that recent [[climate change]] has diminished the intensity of periglaciation.&lt;ref name=Knightetal2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knight |first1=Jasper |last2=Grab |first2=Stefan W.|last3=Carbutt |first3=Clinton |date=2018 |title=Influence of mountain geomorphology on alpine ecosystems in the Drakensberg Alpine Centre, Southern Africa |url= |journal=[[Geografiska Annaler|Geografiska Annaler: Series A, Physical Geography]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1080/04353676.2017.1418628 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composition of rocks ===

The geological composition of Drakensberg (escarpment wall) varies considerably along its more than 1000&amp;nbsp;km length. The Limpopo and Mpumalanga Drakensberg are capped by an erosion resistant quartzite layer which is part of the Transvaal Supergroup which also forms the [[Magaliesberg]] to the north and northwest of Pretoria.&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt; These rocks are more than 2000 million years old. South of the 26°S parallel the Drakensberg escarpment is composed of [[Ecca Group|Ecca shales]], which belong to the [[Karoo Supergroup]], which are 300 million years old.&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt;&lt;ref name="geological map" /&gt; The portion of the Drakensberg that forms the KwaZulu-Natal – Free State border is formed by slightly younger [[Beaufort Group|Beaufort rocks]] (250 million years old) which are also part of the Karoo Supergroup. The Ecca and Beaufort groups are composed of sedimentary rocks which are less erosion resistant than the other rocks which make up the Drakensberg escarpment. This portion of escarpment is therefore not as impressive as the Mpumalanga and Lesotho stretches of the Drakensberg.  The Drakensberg which form the north-eastern and eastern borders of Lesotho, as well as the Eastern Cape Drakensberg are composed of a thick layer of basalt (lava) which erupted 180 million years ago.&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt;&lt;ref name="geological map" /&gt; That rests on the youngest of the Karoo Supergroup sediments, the [[Stormberg Group|Clarens sandstone]], which was laid down under desert conditions, about 200 million years ago.&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt;&lt;ref name="geological map" /&gt;

== Highest peaks ==

The highest peak is [[Thabana Ntlenyana]], at {{convert|3482|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Other notable peaks include [[Mafadi]] ({{convert|3450|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}), [[Makoaneng]] at {{convert|3416|m}}, [[Njesuthi]] at {{convert|3408|m}}, [[Champagne Castle]] at {{convert|3377|m}}, [[Giant's Castle]] at {{convert|3315|m}}, [[Ben Macdhui (South Africa)|Ben Macdhui]] at {{convert|3001|m}}, and [[Popple Peak]] at {{convert|3331|m}}, all of these are in the area bordering on Lesotho. Another popular area for hikers is [[Cathedral Peak (South Africa)|Cathedral Peak]]. North of Lesotho the range becomes lower and less rugged until entering Mpumalanga where the quartzite mountains of the Transvaal Drakensberg are loftier and more broken and form the eastern rim of the Transvaal Basin, the [[Blyde River Canyon]] lying within this stretch. The geology of this section is the same as and continuous with that of the [[Magaliesberg]].

== Ecology ==

[[File:Drakensberg 00.jpg|thumb|Tugela Falls vicinity – Tugela River in valley]]
[[File:Little Saddle.jpg|thumb|Little Saddle]]
The high treeless peaks of the Drakensberg (from {{convert|2,500|m|ft|abbr=on}} upwards) have been described by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the ''Drakensberg alti-montane grasslands and woodlands'' [[ecoregion]]. These steep slopes are the most southerly high mountains in Africa, and being further from the equator provide cooler habitats at lower elevations than most mountain ranges on the continent. The high rainfall generates many mountain streams and rivers, including the sources of the [[Orange River]], southern Africa's longest, and the [[Tugela River]]. These mountains also have the world's second-highest waterfall, the [[Tugela Falls]] (Thukela Falls), which has a total drop of {{convert|947|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The rivers that run from the Drakensberg are an essential resource for South Africa's economy, providing water for the industrial provinces of Mpumalanga and [[Gauteng]], which contains the city of [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1003|name=Drakensberg alti-montane grasslands and woodlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate is wet and cool at the high elevations, which experience snowfall in winter.

Meanwhile, the grassy lower slopes (from {{convert|1,800|to|2500|m|ft|abbr=on}}) of the Drakensberg in [[Swaziland]], South Africa and Lesotho constitute the ''Drakensberg Montane Grassland, Woodland, and Forest''.

=== Flora ===

[[File:Cathedral Valley.jpg|thumb|Cathedral Valley]]
The mountains are rich in plant life, including a large number of species listed in the Red Data Book of threatened plants, with 119 species listed as globally endangered and "of the 2 153 plant species in the park, a remarkable 98 are endemic or near-endemic".&lt;ref name="Barrier of Spears" /&gt;

The ''flora of the high alti-montane grasslands'' is mainly [[tussock grass]], creeping plants, and small shrubs such as [[erica]]s. These include the rare Spiral Aloe ''([[Aloe polyphylla]])'', which as its name suggests has leaves with a spiral shape.

Meanwhile, the ''lower slopes'' are mainly grassland but are also home to [[conifer]]s, which are rare in Africa, the species of conifer found in the Drakensberg is [[Podocarpus]]. The grassland itself is of interest as it contains a great number of [[Endemism|endemic]] plants. Grasses found here include oat grass ''[[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]]'', ''[[Diheteropogon]] filifolius'', ''[[Sporobolus]] centrifugus'', caterpillar grass ''([[Harpochloa falx]])'', ''[[Cymbopogon]] dieterlenii'', and [[Eulalia villosa]].

In the highest part of Drakensberg the composition of the flora is independent on [[slope aspect]] (dicrection) and varies depending on the hardness of the rock [[clast (geology)|clasts]]. This hardness is related to [[weathering]] and is variable even within a single [[landform]].&lt;ref name=Knightetal2018/&gt;

=== Fauna ===

The Drakensberg area is "home to 299 recorded bird species"' making up "37% of all non-marine avian species in southern Africa."&lt;ref name="Barrier of Spears" /&gt; There are 24 species of snakes in the Drakensberg, two of which are highly venomous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A field guide to the Natal Drakensberg|last=Irwin|first=Pat|publisher=The Natal Branch of the Wildlife Society of Southern Africa|year=1983|isbn=0 949966 452|location=|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fauna of the high peaks ====

There is one bird that is endemic to the high peaks, the [[mountain pipit]] ''(Anthus hoeschi)'', while another six are found mainly here: [[Bush blackcap]] ''(Lioptilus nigricapillus)'', [[buff-streaked chat]] ''(Oenanthe bifasciata)'', [[Rudd's lark]] ''(Heteromirafra ruddi)'', [[Drakensberg rockjumper]] ''(Chaetops aurantius)'', [[yellow-breasted pipit]] ''(Anthus chloris)'', and [[Drakensberg siskin]] ''(Serinus symonsi)''. The endangered [[Cape vulture]] and [[lesser kestrel]] are two of the birds of prey that hunt in the mountains. Mammals include [[klipspringer]] ''(Oreotragus oreotragus)'', [[common eland|eland]] ''(Taurotragus oryx)'' and [[mountain reedbuck]] ''(Redunca fulvorufula)''. Other endemic species include three frogs found in the mountain streams, [[Drakensberg river frog]], ''(Amietia dracomontana)'', Phofung river frog ''([[Amietia vertebralis]])'' and [[Maluti river frog]] ''(Amietia umbraculata)''. Fish are found in the many rivers and streams including the [[Maluti redfin]] (''Pseudobarbus quathlambae''), which was thought to be extinct but has been found in the [[Senqunyane River]] in Lesotho.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |title=Maloti Minnow |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602183916/http://www.lhwp.org.ls/environment/nehp/conservation/minnow/default.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fauna of the lower slopes ====

[[File:Ukhahlamba Drakensburg Cliffs.jpg|thumb|Drakensberg Cliffs]]
The lower slopes of the Drakensberg support much wildlife, perhaps most importantly the rare southern [[white rhinoceros]] (which was nurtured here when facing extinction) and the [[black wildebeest]] (''Connochaetes gnou'', which {{as of | 2011| lc = on}} only thrives in protected areas and game reserves). The area is home to large herds of grazing and antelopes such as [[common eland|eland]] ''(Taurotragus oryx)'', [[reedbuck]] ''(Redunca arundinum)'', [[mountain reedbuck]] ''(Redunca fulvorufula)'', [[grey rhebok]] ''(Pelea capreolus)'', and even some [[oribi]] ''(Ourebia ourebi)''. [[Chacma baboon]]s are also present. Endemic species include a large number of [[chameleon]]s and other reptiles. There is one endemic frog, forest rain frog ''([[Breviceps sylvestris]])'', and four more that are found mainly in these mountains; long-toed tree frog ''([[Leptopelis xenodactylus]])'', plaintive rain frog ''([[Breviceps maculatus]])'', rough rain frog ''([[Breviceps verrucosus]])'', and Poynton's caco ''([[Cacosternum poyntoni]])''.

=== Conservation ===

[[File:South Africa-Mpumalanga-Gods Window002.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Mpumalanga Drakensberg portion of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]], from [[God's Window]], near [[Graskop]] looking south. The hard erosion resistant layer that forms the upper edge of the escarpment here consists of flat lying quartzite belonging to the Black Reef Formation, which also forms the [[Magaliesberg]] mountains near Pretoria.&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt;&lt;ref name=norman /&gt;]]
The '''high slopes''' are hard to reach so the environment is fairly undamaged. However, tourism in the Drakensberg is developing, with a variety of [[Drakensberg hiking|hiking trails]], hotels and resorts appearing on the slopes. Most of the higher South African parts of the range have been designated as [[game reserve]]s or [[wilderness area]]s. Of these the [[uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park]] was listed by [[UNESCO]] in 2000 as a [[World Heritage]] site. The park is also in the [[List of Wetlands of International Importance]] (under the [[Ramsar Convention]]). The [[Royal Natal National Park]], which contains some of the higher peaks, is part of this large park complex. Adjacent to the Ukhahlamba Drakensberg World Heritage Site is the 1900 ha [http://www.allendale.co.za Allendale Mountain Reserve] which is the largest private reserve adjoining the World Heritage Site and is found in the accessible Kamberg area, the heart of the historic San (Bushman) painting region of the Ukhahlamba.

The grassland of the ''lower slopes'' meanwhile has been greatly affected by agriculture, especially overgrazing. Original grassland and forest has nearly all disappeared and more protection is needed, though the Giant's Castle reserve is a haven for the [[common eland|eland]] and also is a breeding ground for the [[bearded vulture]].

[[File:GiantsCastlePanoramaSmall.jpg|center|thumb|800px|Panorama of the [[Giant's Castle]] region]]
The [[Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area]] was established to preserve some of the high mountain areas of the range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maloti.org.ls/home/ Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130182044/http://www.maloti.org.ls/home/ |date=30 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Urban areas ==

Towns and cities in the Drakensberg area include, from South to North, [[Matatiele, Eastern Cape|Matatiele]] and [[Barkly East]] in the Eastern Cape Province; [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]], [[Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal|Newcastle]], [[Ulundi, KwaZulu-Natal|Ulundi]] – the former [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] capital, [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]] and [[Ixopo, KwaZulu-Natal|Ixopo]] in KwaZulu-Natal; all of Lesotho, whose capital is [[Maseru]] and [[Tzaneen]] in [[Limpopo Province]].

== San cave paintings ==

Some 20,000 individual rock paintings have been recorded at 500 different caves and overhanging sites between the Drakensberg Royal Natal National Park and Bushman's Nek.&lt;ref name="Drakensberg Tourism" /&gt; Due to the materials used in their production, these paintings are difficult to date but there is anthropological evidence, including many hunting implements, that the San people existed in the Drakensberg at least 40,000 years ago, and possibly over 100,000 years ago. According to [http://drakensbergmountains.co.za/ mountainsides.co.za], "[i]n Nd edema Gorge in the Central Ginsberg 3,900 paintings have been recorded at 17 sites. One of them, Sebaayeni Cave, contains 1,146 individual paintings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drakensbergmountains.co.za/bushman-rock-art.html|title=Drakensberg Rock Art|access-date=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website [http://www.southafrica.info/about/geography/drakensberg-050705.htm  south Africa.info] indicates that though "the oldest painting on a rock shelter wall in the Ginsberg dates back about 2400 years.....paint chips at least a thousand years older have also been found."&lt;ref name="Barrier of Spears" /&gt; The site also indicates that "[t]he rock art of the Drakensberg is the largest and most concentrated group of rock paintings in Africa south of the Sahara, and is outstanding both in quality and diversity of subject."&lt;ref name="Barrier of Spears" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==

The Drakensberg was featured in the 2009 [[United States|American]] [[science fiction film]] [[2012 (film)|''2012'']]. It was mentioned in the last scene of the movie, where after twenty-seven days of a great flood which people tried to survive by building arks, the waters began receding. The arks approach the [[Cape of Good Hope]], where the Drakensberg (now the tallest mountain range on Earth)  emerges.

This is a list of '''extreme points of Earth''', the geographical locations that are farther north or south than, higher or lower in elevation than, or farthest inland or out to sea from, any other locations on the [[landmass]]es, [[continent]]s or [[country|countries]].

For other lists of extreme points on Earth, including places that hold temperature and weather records, see [[Extremes on Earth]], [[Lists of extreme points]], and [[List of weather records]].

==Earth==
===Latitude and longitude===
* The '''northernmost point on Earth''' is the [[Geographic North Pole]], in the [[Arctic Ocean]].
** The '''[[Most northerly point of land|northernmost point on land]]''' is the northern tip of [[Kaffeklubben Island]], north of [[Greenland]] ({{Coord|83|40|N|29|50|W|type:landmark|name=northernmost point on land}}), which lies slightly north of [[Cape Morris Jesup]], Greenland ({{Coord|83|38|N|32|40|W|type:landmark|name=Cape Morris Jesup}}). Various shifting [[gravel bar]]s lie farther north, the most famous being [[Oodaaq]].

====Highest points====
[[File:Volcán Chimborazo, "El Taita Chimborazo".jpg|thumb|[[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] in [[Ecuador]] is the farthest point from Earth's center.]]

* The '''highest point on Earth's surface''' measured from [[sea level]] is the summit of [[Mount Everest]] on the border of [[Nepal]] and [[China]]. While [[Mount Everest#Surveys|measurements of its height]] vary slightly, the elevation of its peak is usually given as {{cvt|8848|m|ft|0}} above sea level. It was first reached by Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] of [[New Zealand]] and Sherpa of Nepal [[Tenzing Norgay]] in 1953 ([[Mount Everest#Early attempts|with speculation]] that it may have been reached in 1924).
* The '''point farthest from Earth's center''' is the summit of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geology.com/records/highest-mountain-in-the-world.shtml |title=Highest Mountain in the World |work=geology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ecuador]], at {{cvt|6384.4|km|mi|1}} from Earth's center; the peak's elevation relative to sea level is {{cvt|6263.47|m|ft|0}}.{{#tag:ref|The elevation given here was established by a [[GPS]] survey in February 2016. The survey was carried out by a team from the [[Institut de recherche pour le développement|French Research Institute for Development]], working in cooperation with the [[Ecuador]]ian Military Geographic Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chimborazo, el volcán de Ecuador más alto que el Everest (si se mide desde el centro de la Tierra) |publisher=[[BBC Mundo]] |date=7 April 2016 |url=http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2016/04/160407_por_que_chimborazo_ecuador_mas_lejos_centro_tierra_que_el_everest_dgm |access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name="elev"|group="note"}} This is because Earth is an [[flattening|oblate]] [[spheroid]] rather than a perfect [[spherical Earth|sphere]]; it is [[equatorial bulge|wider]] at the [[Equator]] and narrower between the [[geographical pole|poles]]. Therefore, the summit of Chimborazo, which is near the Equator, is farther away from Earth's center than the summit of Mount Everest is; the latter is {{cvt|2168|m|ft|1}} closer, at {{cvt|6382.3|km|mi|1}} from Earth's center. [[Peru]]'s [[Huascarán]] (at {{cvt|6768|m|ft|0}}) contends closely with Chimborazo, the difference in the mountains' heights being just {{convert|23|m|ft|}}.
* The '''fastest point on Earth''' or, in other words, '''the point furthest from the axis of Earth''' is the summit of [[Cayambe (volcano)|Cayambe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Klenke |first1=Paul |title=Distance to the Center of the Earth |url=https://www.summitpost.org/distance-to-the-center-of-the-earth/849764 |website=Summit Post |access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Ecuador, at {{cvt|1675.89|kph|mph|0}} and {{cvt|6383.95|km|mi|0}} from the axis. Like Chimborazo, which is the fourth fastest peak at {{cvt|1675.47|kph|mph|0}}, it is close to the Equator and takes advantage of the oblate spheroid [[figure of Earth]]. More importantly, however, it being so near the Equator means that the majority of its distance from Earth's center goes into it being away from the axis. The importance of [[latitude]] becomes most apparent when one looks at the [[Challenger Deep]] (speed of {{cvt|1639.15|kph|mph|0}}) compared to Mount Everest (speed of {{cvt|1481.67|kph|mph|0}}).

====Poles of inaccessibility====
{{main|Pole of inaccessibility}}
Each [[continent]] has its own [[Pole of inaccessibility#Continental poles of inaccessibility|continental pole of inaccessibility]], defined as the place on the continent that is farthest from any ocean. Similarly, each ocean has its own [[Pole of inaccessibility#Oceanic poles of inaccessibility|oceanic pole of inaccessibility]], defined as the place in the ocean that is farthest from any land.

=====Continental=====
* The '''most distant point from an ocean''' is the Eurasian Pole of Inaccessibility (or "EPIA") {{Coord|46|17|N|86|40|E|name=Continental Pole of Inaccessibility}}, in [[China]]'s [[Xinjiang]] region near the border with Kazakhstan. Calculations have shown that this point, located in the [[Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert]], is {{convert|2645|km|abbr=in}} from the nearest coastline. The nearest settlement to the EPIA is [[Suluk, Xinjiang|Suluk]] at {{Coord|46|15|N|86|50|E|name=Suluk}}, about {{convert|11|km|abbr=in}} to the east.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} A 2007 study suggests that the historical calculation of the EPIA failed to recognize the point where the [[Gulf of Ob]] joins the Arctic Ocean, and proposes instead that varying definitions of coastline could result in other locations for the EPIA:
** EPIA1, somewhere between {{Coord|44|17|N|82|11|E|name=EPIA1.1}} and {{Coord|44|29|N|82|19|E|name=EPIA1.2}}, is about {{convert|2510|+/-|10|km}} from the nearest ocean.

=====Oceanic=====
* The '''most distant point from land''' is the Pacific pole of inaccessibility (also called "Point Nemo"), which lies in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] at {{Coord|48|52.6|S|123|23.6|W|type:landmark|name=Point Nemo}}, approximately {{convert|2688|km|0|abbr=on}} from the nearest land (equidistant from [[Ducie Island]] in the [[Pitcairn Islands]] to the north, [[Motu Nui]] off [[Rapa Nui]] to the northeast, and Maher Island off [[Siple Island]] near [[Marie Byrd Land]], [[Antarctica]], to the south).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/nemo.html |title=Where is Point Nemo? |work=NOAA |accessdate=20 February 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other places considered the most remote====
[[Image:Bouvet Island ISS017-E-16161 no text.JPG|thumb|[[Bouvet Island]]]]
* The '''most remote island''' is [[Bouvet Island]], a small, uninhabited island in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] that is a [[dependencies of Norway|dependency]] of [[Norway]]. It lies at coordinates {{Coord|54|26|S|3|24|E|type:landmark|name=most remote island}}. The nearest land is the uninhabited [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Antarctica]], over {{convert|1600|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south. The nearest inhabited lands are [[Tristan da Cunha]], {{convert|2260|km|0|abbr=on}} away, and the coast of [[South Africa]], {{convert|2580|km|0|abbr=on}} away.
* The title for '''most remote inhabited island or archipelago''' (the farthest away from any other permanently inhabited place) depends on how the question is interpreted. If the south Atlantic island [[Tristan da Cunha]] (population about 300) and its dependency [[Gough Island]] (with a small staffed research post), which are {{convert|399|km|0|abbr=on}} from each other, are considered part of the same archipelago, or if Gough Island is not counted because it has no permanent residents, then Tristan da Cunha is the world's most remote inhabited island/archipelago: the main island, also called Tristan da Cunha, is {{convert|2434|km|0|abbr=on}} from the island [[Saint Helena]], {{convert|2816|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[South Africa]], and {{convert|3360|km|abbr=in}} from South America. It is {{convert|1845|km|0|abbr=on}} away from uninhabited [[Bouvet Island]]. However, if Gough and [[Tristan da Cunha]] are considered separately, they disqualify each other, and the most remote inhabited island is [[Easter Island]] in the South Pacific Ocean, which lies {{convert|2075|km|mi}} from [[Pitcairn Island]] (about 50 residents in 2013), {{convert|2606|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Rikitea]] on the island of [[Mangareva]] (the nearest town with a population over 500), and {{convert|3512|km|mi}} from the coast of [[Chile]] (the nearest continental point). The [[Kerguelen Islands]] in the southern Indian Ocean are another contender, lying {{convert|1340|km|mi}} from the small [[Alfred Faure]] scientific station in [[Île de la Possession]], but otherwise more than {{convert|3300|km|mi}} from the coast of [[Madagascar]] (the nearest permanently inhabited place), {{convert|450|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of uninhabited [[Heard Island]] and [[McDonald Islands]], and {{convert|1440|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the non-permanent scientific station located in [[Île Amsterdam]].
* The '''most remote city...'''
** '''...with a population in excess of one million from the nearest city with a population in excess of one million''' is [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. The nearest city of comparable size or greater is [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], {{convert|2168.9|km|mi}} away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daftlogic.com/projects-google-maps-distance-calculator.htm Draft Logic – Google Maps Distance Calculator], accessed 4 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''...with a population in excess of one million from the nearest city with a population above 100,000''' is [[Perth]], Australia, located {{convert|2138|km}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelmath.com/flying-distance/from/Perth,+Australia/to/Adelaide,+Australia |title=Flight Distance from Perth, Australia to Adelaide, Australia |work=travelmath.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; away from [[Adelaide]], Australia.
** '''...with a population in excess of 100,000 from the nearest city of at least that population''' is [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], United States. The nearest city of comparable size or greater is [[San Francisco]], {{convert|3850|km|abbr=in}} away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityextremes.com/isolated.php |title=The Most Isolated Cities of the World |work=cityextremes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''...that is a national capital from the nearest national capital''' is a tie between [[Wellington]], New Zealand, and [[Canberra]], Australia, which are {{convert|2326|km|0|abbr=on}} apart from each other. 
* The '''most remote airport in the world''' from another airport is [[Mataveri International Airport]] (IPC) on [[Easter Island]], which has a single runway for military and public use. It is located {{convert|2603|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Totegegie Airport]] (GMR; very few flights) in the [[Gambier Islands]], [[French Polynesia]] and {{convert|3759|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport|Santiago, Chile]] (SCL; a fairly large airport). In comparison, the airport at the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] (NZSP) is not very remote at all, being located only {{convert|1355|km|mi|0}} from [[Williams Field]] (NZWD) near [[Ross Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=IPC-SCL%2CIPC-GMR%2CNZWD-NZSP&amp;DU=km |title=Great Circle Mapper |work=gcmap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--but is it the most remote airport from city/inhabited place, or if not, which one is? especially when compare to Tibet's 2nd highest airport at 2011.--&gt;

===Centre===
* Since the Earth is a [[spheroid]], its centre (the [[core of the Earth|core]]) is thousands of kilometres beneath its [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. On the surface, the '''center of the standard geographic model''' as viewed on a traditional world map is the point 0°, 0° (the [[coordinates]] of zero degrees latitude by zero degrees longitude), which is located in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] approximately {{convert|614|km|abbr=in}} south of [[Accra]], [[Ghana]], in the [[Gulf of Guinea]], at the intersection of the [[Equator]] and the [[IERS Reference Meridian|Prime Meridian]]. However, the selection for the Prime Meridian as the 0° longitude meridian is culturally and historically dependent and therefore arbitrary.
* The '''[[Center of population#World|center of population]]''', the place to which there is the shortest average route for every individual human being in the world, could also be considered a "center of the world". This point is located in the north of the [[Indian subcontinent]], although the precise location has never been calculated and is constantly shifting due to changes in the distribution of the human population across the planet.

===Longest lines between two points===

====Along constant latitude====
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
* The '''longest continuous east-west distance on land''' is {{convert|10726|km|abbr=in}} along the latitude 48°24'53"N, from the west coast of France ({{Coord|48|24|53|N|4|47|44|W}}) through [[Central Europe]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]] and [[China]], to a point on the east coast of Russia ({{Coord|48|24|53|N|140|6|3|E}}).
** The '''longest continuous east-west distance on land including permanent ice shelf''' is {{convert|7958|km|abbr=in}} along the latitude 78°35'S; this is the minimum extent of the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], [[Antarctica]] and is subject to change.
* The '''longest continuous east-west distance at sea''' is {{convert|22471|km|abbr=in}} along the latitude 55°59'S, south of [[Cape Horn]], [[South America]]. The longest in the northern hemisphere is {{convert|4435|km|abbr=in}} along the latitude 83°40'N, north of [[Kaffeklubben Island]], [[Greenland]].
** The '''longest continuous east-west distance at sea between two continents''' is {{convert|15409|km|abbr=in}} along the latitude 18°39'12"N, from the coast of [[Hainan]], China ({{Coord|18|39|12|N|110|15|9|E}}) across the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the coast of [[Michoacán]], [[Mexico]] ({{Coord|18|39|12|N|103|42|6|W}}).

====Along constant longitude====
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
* The '''longest continuous north-south distance on land''' is {{convert|7590|km|abbr=in}} along the meridian 99°1'30"E, from the northern tip of Siberia in the Russian Federation ({{Coord|76|13|6|N|99|1|30|E}}), through Mongolia, China, and [[Myanmar]], to a point on the south coast of [[Thailand]] ({{Coord|7|53|24|N|99|1|30|E}}).
** The longest in Africa is {{convert|7417|km|abbr=in}} along the meridian 20°12'E, from the north coast of [[Libya]] ({{Coord|32|19|0|N|20|12|0|E}}), through [[Chad]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], and [[Botswana]], to the south coast of [[South Africa]] ({{Coord|34|41|30|S|20|12|0|E}}).
** The longest in South America is {{convert|7098|km|abbr=in}} along the meridian 70°2'W, from the north coast of [[Venezuela]] ({{Coord|11|30|30|N|70|2|0|W}}), through [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]], to the southern tip of [[Argentina]] ({{Coord|52|33|30|S|70|2|0|W}}).
** The longest in North America is {{convert|5813|km|abbr=in}} along the meridian 97°52'30"W, from northern [[Canada]] ({{Coord|68|21|0|N|97|52|30|W}}), through the [[United States]], to southern Mexico ({{Coord|16|1|0|N|97|52|30|W}}).
* The '''longest continuous north-south distance at sea''' is {{convert|15986|km|abbr=in}} along the meridian 34°45'45"W, from the coast of Eastern Greenland ({{Coord|66|23|45|N|34|45|45|W}}) across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf]], on the coast of Antarctica ({{Coord|77|37|0|S|34|45|45|W}}). The longest in the Pacific Ocean is {{convert|15883|km|abbr=in}} along the meridian 172°8'30"W, from the coast of Siberia ({{Coord|64|45|0|N|172|8|30|W}}) to the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica ({{Coord|78|20|0|S|172|8|30|W}}).
* The '''meridian that crosses the greatest total distance on land''' (disregarding intervening bodies of water) is still to be determined. It is likely located in the vicinity of 22°E, which is the longest integer meridian that fits that criterion, crossing a total of {{convert|13035|km|abbr=in}} of land through Europe ({{convert|3370|km|abbr=in}}), Africa ({{convert|7458|km|abbr=in}}), and Antarctica ({{convert|2207|km|abbr=in}}). More than 65% of the meridian's length is located on land. The meridian that crosses Giza Great Pyramid (31°08'3.69"E) is {{convert|855|km|abbr=in}} shorter.
** The next six longest integer meridians by total distance over land are, in order:
*** 23°E: {{convert|12953|km|abbr=in}} through Europe ({{convert|3325|km|abbr=in}}), Africa ({{convert|7415|km|abbr=in}}), and Antarctica ({{convert|2214|km|abbr=in}})
*** 27°E: {{convert|12943|km|abbr=in}} through Europe ({{convert|3254|km|abbr=in}}), Asia ({{convert|246|km|abbr=in}}), Africa ({{convert|7223|km|abbr=in}}), and Antarctica ({{convert|2221|km|abbr=in}})

*** 24°E: {{convert|12794|km|abbr=in}} through Europe ({{convert|3263|km|abbr=in}}), Africa ({{convert|7346|km|abbr=in}}), and Antarctica ({{convert|2185|km|abbr=in}})
*** 28°E: {{convert|12778|km|abbr=in}} through Europe ({{convert|3039|km|abbr=in}}), Asia ({{convert|388|km|abbr=in}}), and Africa ({{convert|7117|km|abbr=in}})

====Along any geodesic====
These are the longest [[geodesic|straight lines]] that can be drawn between any two points on the surface of the Earth and remain exclusively over land or water; the points need not lie on the same latitude or longitude.
* The '''longest continuous straight-line distance in any direction on land''' is {{convert|13573|km|abbr=in}}, along a line that begins on the West African coast near [[Greenville, Liberia|Greenville]], [[Liberia]] ({{Coord|5|2|51.59|N|9|7|23.26|W}}), goes across the [[Suez Canal]], and ends at the top of a peninsula approximately {{convert|100|km|abbr=in}} northeast of [[Wenzhou]], China {{Coord|28|17|7.68|N|121|38|17.31|E}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=5%B02%26%238242%3B51.59%26%238243%3BN+9%B07%26%238242%3B23.26%26%238243%3BW+-+28%B017%26%238242%3B7.68%26%238243%3BN+121%B038%26%238242%3B17.31%26%238243%3BE%0D%0A&amp;MS=bm&amp;DU=mi (Map from gcmap)]&lt;/ref&gt;
** The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental [[Africa]] is {{convert|8,402|km|abbr=in}}, along a line that begins just east of [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]] and ends {{convert|100|km|abbr=in}} east of [[Port Elizabeth]], [[South Africa]]. This line passes through Morocco, [[Algeria]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Cameroon]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]] and South Africa.
** The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental [[Asia]] is {{convert|10,152|km|abbr=in}}, along a line that begins on the [[India]]n coast near [[Kanyakumari]] and ends at the [[Bering Sea]] coast of the [[Chukchi Peninsula]] in [[Russia]]. This line passes through India, [[Nepal]], [[China]], [[Mongolia]] and Russia.
** The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental [[Europe]] (defining the [[Ural Mountains]] as the border between Europe and Asia) is {{convert|5,325|km|abbr=in}}, along a line that begins at [[Cape St. Vincent]], [[Portugal]] and ends at the Urals, near the town of [[Perm, Russia]]. This line passes through Portugal, [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]] and Russia.
** The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] is {{convert|4,053|km|abbr=in}}, along a line that begins at the southern end of [[Cape Range National Park]] in [[Western Australia]] and ends at the town of [[Byron Bay]] in [[New South Wales]].
* There are several possible candidates for the '''longest continuous straight-line distance in any direction at sea''', as there are many possible ways to travel along a great circle for more than the [[antipodes|antipodic]] length of {{convert|19840|km|abbr=in}}. Some good examples of such routes would be:
** From the south coast of [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] province somewhere near Port of [[Karachi, Pakistan|Karachi]], [[Pakistan]] ({{Coord|25|25|N|66|25|E}}) across the [[Arabian Sea]], southwest through the Indian Ocean, near [[Comoros]], passing Namaete Canyon, near the South African coast, across the South Atlantic Ocean, then west across [[Cape Horn]], then northwest across the Pacific Ocean, near [[Easter Island]], passing the [[Antipodes|antipodal point]] near [[Amlia]] island, through the South [[Bering Sea]] and ending somewhere on the northeast coast of [[Kamchatka]], near [[Ossora]] ({{Coord|59|38|N|163|24|E}}).

A '''fountain''' (from the [[Latin]] "fons" ([[genitive]] "fontis"), a source or [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]]) is a piece of [[architecture]] which pours [[water]] into a basin or jets it into the air to supply [[drinking water]] and/or for a decorative or dramatic effect.

Fountains were originally purely functional, connected to springs or [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] and used to provide drinking water and water for bathing and washing to the residents of cities, towns and villages. Until the late 19th century most fountains operated by [[gravity]], and needed a source of water higher than the fountain, such as a [[reservoir]] or aqueduct, to make the water flow or jet into the air.

In addition to providing drinking water, fountains were used for decoration and to celebrate their builders. Roman fountains were decorated with bronze or stone masks of animals or heroes. In the Middle Ages, Moorish and Muslim garden designers used fountains to create miniature versions of the gardens of paradise. King [[Louis XIV]] of France used fountains in the [[Gardens of Versailles]] to illustrate his power over nature. The [[baroque architecture|baroque]] decorative fountains of Rome in the 17th and 18th centuries marked the arrival point of restored Roman aqueducts and glorified the Popes who built them.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Prévot, ''Histoire des jardins'', Editions Sud Ouest, Bordeaux, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, as indoor plumbing became the main source of drinking water, urban fountains became purely decorative. Mechanical pumps replaced gravity and allowed fountains to recycle water and to force it high into the air. The [[Jet d'Eau]] in [[Lake Geneva]], built in 1951, shoots water {{convert|140|m}} in the air. The highest such fountain in the world is [[King Fahd's Fountain]] in [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia, which spouts water {{convert|260|m}} above the Red Sea.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;SAMIRAD (Saudi Arabia Market Information Resource Directory)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fountains are used today to decorate city parks and squares; to honor individuals or events; for recreation and for entertainment. A [[Splash pad]] or [[spray pool]] allows city residents to enter, get wet and cool off in summer. The [[musical fountain]] combines moving jets of water, colored lights and recorded music, controlled by a computer, for dramatic effects.  Fountains [[Hydraulophone|can themselves also be musical instruments]] played by obstruction of one or more of their water jets.
[[Fountain#Drinking fountain|Drinking fountains]] provide clean drinking water in public buildings, parks and public spaces.

===Ancient fountains===
[[File:PM - Brunnen mit Elefantenkopf.jpg|thumb| Hellenistic fountain head from the Pergamon museum]] 
Ancient civilizations built stone basins to capture and hold precious drinking water. A carved stone basin, dating to around 2000&amp;nbsp;BC, was discovered in the ruins of the ancient [[Sumer]]ian city of [[Lagash]] in modern [[Iraq]]. The ancient [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] constructed a series of basins in the gorge of the Comel River, carved in solid rock, connected by small channels, descending to a stream. The lowest basin was decorated with carved reliefs of two lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=fountain|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/214794/fountain|accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ancient [[Egyptians]] had ingenious systems for hoisting water up from the [[Nile]] for drinking and irrigation, but without a higher source of water it was not possible to make water flow by gravity, and no Egyptian fountains or pictures of fountains have been found.

The ancient Greeks used [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] and gravity-powered fountains to distribute water. According to ancient historians, fountains existed in [[Athens]], [[Corinth]], and other ancient Greek cities in the 6th century BC as the terminating points of aqueducts which brought water from springs and rivers into the cities. In the 6th century BC, the Athenian ruler [[Peisistratos]] built the main fountain of Athens, the ''Enneacrounos'', in the [[Agora]], or main square. It had nine large cannons, or spouts, which supplied drinking water to local residents.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'', 1.59&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek fountains were made of stone or marble, with water flowing through bronze pipes and emerging from the mouth of a sculpted mask that represented the head of a lion or the muzzle of an animal. Most Greek fountains flowed by simple gravity, but they also discovered how to use principle of a [[siphon]] to make water spout, as seen in pictures on Greek vases.&lt;ref name="Plantier"&gt;Louis Plantier, ''Fontaines de Provence et de la Côte d'Azur'', Édisud, Aix-en-Provence, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Roman fountains===
[[File:Ricostruzione del giardino della casa dei vetii di pompei (mostra al giardino di boboli, 2007) 01.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of a Roman courtyard fountain in [[Pompeii]] (1st century AD)]]
The Ancient Romans built an extensive system of aqueducts from mountain rivers and lakes to provide water for the fountains and baths of Rome. The Roman engineers used lead pipes instead of bronze to distribute the water throughout the city. The excavations at [[Pompeii]], which revealed the city as it was when it was destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in 79&amp;nbsp;AD, uncovered free-standing fountains and basins placed at intervals along city streets, fed by siphoning water upwards from lead pipes under the street. The excavations of Pompeii also showed that the homes of wealthy Romans often had a small fountain in the atrium, or interior courtyard, with water coming from the city water supply and spouting into a small bowl or basin.

Ancient Rome was a city of fountains. According to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was named ''curator aquarum'' or guardian of the water of Rome in 98&amp;nbsp;AD, Rome had nine aqueducts which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.&lt;ref&gt;Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Société d'édition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans were able to make fountains jet water into the air, by using the pressure of water flowing from a distant and higher source of water to create [[Head (hydraulic)|hydraulic head]], or force. Illustrations of fountains in gardens spouting water are found on wall paintings in Rome from the 1st century BC, and in the villas of Pompeii.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Prevot, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  The Villa of [[Hadrian]] in Tivoli featured a large swimming basin with jets of water. [[Pliny the Younger]] described the banquet room of a Roman villa where a fountain began to jet water when visitors sat on a marble seat. The water flowed into a basin, where the courses of a banquet were served in floating dishes shaped like boats.&lt;ref name="Philippe Prevot, pg. 21"&gt;Philippe Prevot, pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman engineers built aqueducts and fountains throughout the Roman Empire. Examples can be found today in the ruins of Roman towns in [[Vaison-la-Romaine]] and [[Glanum]] in France, in [[Augst]], Switzerland, and other sites.

===Medieval fountains===
[[File:Thoronet Lavabo.JPG|thumb|Lavabo at [[Le Thoronet Abbey]], Provence, (12th century)]]
During the Middle Ages, Roman aqueducts were wrecked or fell into decay, and many fountains throughout Europe stopped working, so fountains existed mainly in art and literature, or in secluded monasteries or palace gardens. Fountains in the Middle Ages were associated with the source of life, purity, wisdom, innocence, and the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref&gt;Psalms 36:9; Proverbs 13:14; Revelation 22:1; Dante's ''Paradisio'' XXV 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In illuminated manuscripts like the [[:File:Folio 25v - The Garden of Eden.jpg|''Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry'' (1411–1416)]], the Garden of Eden was shown with a graceful gothic fountain in the center (see illustration). The [[:File:Ghent Altarpiece D - Adoration of the Lamb 2.jpg|Ghent Altarpiece]] by [[Jan van Eyck]], finished in 1432, also shows a fountain as a feature of the adoration of the mystic lamb, a scene apparently set in Paradise.

The cloister of a monastery was supposed to be a replica of the Garden of Eden, protected from the outside world. Simple fountains, called lavabos, were placed inside Medieval monasteries such as [[Le Thoronet Abbey]] in Provence and were used for ritual washing before religious services.&lt;ref&gt;Molina, Nathalie, 1999: ''Le Thoronet Abbey'', Monum – Éditions du patrimoine.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fountains were also found in the enclosed medieval ''jardins d'amour'', "gardens of courtly love" – ornamental gardens used for courtship and relaxation. The medieval romance The ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'' describes a fountain in the center of an enclosed garden, feeding small streams bordered by flowers and fresh herbs.

Some Medieval fountains, like the cathedrals of their time, illustrated biblical stories, local history and the virtues of their time. The [[Fontana Maggiore]] in [[Perugia]], dedicated in 1278, is decorated with stone carvings representing prophets and saints, allegories of the arts, labors of the months, the signs of the zodiac, and scenes from Genesis and Roman history.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Simmes, Fountains, Splash and Spectacle. pg.63&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval fountains could also provide amusement. The gardens of the Counts of Artois at the Château de Hesdin, built in 1295, contained famous fountains, called ''Les Merveilles de Hesdin'' ("The Wonders of Hesdin") which could be triggered to drench surprised visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe'' This type of "water joke" later became popular in Renaissance and baroque gardens.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fountains of the Islamic World===

Shortly after the spread of Islam, the [[Arabs]] incorporated into their city planning the Persian designs of the famous [[Islamic garden]]s. Islamic gardens after the 7th century were traditionally enclosed by walls and were designed to represent [[paradise]]. The [[paradise garden]]s, were laid out in the form of a cross, with four channels representing the rivers of paradise, dividing the four parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe,'' Citadelles &amp; Mazenod, Paris, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Water sometimes spouted from a fountain in the center of the cross, representing the spring or fountain, [[Salsabil]], described in the [[Qur'an]] as the source of the rivers of Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Qur'an, the dead going to paradise would be given water from the spring Salsabil: "And there they will be given a cup whose mixture is of Zanjabil (ginger). A fountain there, called Salsabil." (76:17–18)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, the [[Banū Mūsā]] brothers, a trio of [[Inventions in medieval Islam|Persian Inventors]], were commissioned by the [[Caliph of Baghdad]] to summarize the engineering knowledge of the ancient Greek and Roman world. They wrote a book entitled the ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices]]'', describing the works of the 1st century Greek Engineer [[Hero of Alexandria]] and other engineers, plus many of their own inventions. They described fountains which formed water into different shapes and a wind-powered water pump,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=History of, and Recent Progress in, Wind-Energy Utilization|author=[[Bent Sørensen (physicist)|Bent Sorensen]]|journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment|volume=20|pages=387–424|date=November 1995|doi=10.1146/annurev.eg.20.110195.002131}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not known if any of their fountains were ever actually built.&lt;ref name=Hill-44&gt;{{citation|title=The book of ingenious devices (Kitāb al-ḥiyal)|author=[[Banu Musa]] (authors), [[Donald Routledge Hill]] (translator)|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year=1979|isbn=90-277-0833-9|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persian rulers of the Middle Ages had elaborate water distribution systems and fountains in their palaces and gardens. Water was carried by a pipe into the palace from a source at a higher elevation. Once inside the palace or garden it came up through a small hole in a marble or stone ornament and poured into a basin or garden channels. The gardens of Pasargades had a system of canals which flowed from basin to basin, both watering the garden and making a pleasant sound. The Persian engineers also used the principle of the syphon (called ''shotor-gelu'' in Persian, literally 'neck of the camel) to create fountains which spouted water or made it resemble a bubbling spring. The garden of Fin, near Kashan, used 171 spouts connected to pipes to create a fountain called the ''Howz-e jush'', or "boiling basin".&lt;ref&gt;Yves Porter and Arthur Thevenart, ''Palais et Jardins de Perse'', pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th century Persian poet Azraqi described a Persian fountain:
	
:From a marvelous faucet of gold pours a wave	
:whose clarity is more pure than a soul;
:The turquoise and silver form ribbons in the basin
:coming from this faucet of gold&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Azraqi, H. Massé, Anthologie persane, pg. 44. English translation of excerpt by D.R. Siefkin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocating motion was first described in 1206 by Iraqi [[engineer]] and inventor [[al-Jazari]] when the kings of the [[Artuqid dynasty]] in Turkey commissioned him to manufacture a machine to raise water for their palaces. The finest result was a machine called the [[#Double-action suction pump with valves and reciprocating piston motion|double-acting reciprocating piston pump]], which translated [[rotation|rotary]] motion to [[reciprocating motion|reciprocating]] motion via the [[crankshaft]]-[[connecting rod]] mechanism.&lt;ref name=Crank&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]]. [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%203.htm The Crank-Connecting Rod System in a Continuously Rotating Machine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312021929/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%203.htm |date=12 March 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The palaces of Moorish Spain, particularly the [[Alhambra]] in Granada, had famous fountains. The patio of the Sultan in the gardens of [[Generalife]] in Granada (1319) featured spouts of water pouring into a basin, with channels which irrigated orange and myrtle trees. The garden was modified over the centuries – the jets of water which cross the canal today were added in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alhambra-patronato.es/index.php See the official site of the Alhambra complex for the history of the fountains]&lt;/ref&gt;
The fountain in the [[Court of the Lions]] of the Alhambra, built from 1362 to 1391, is a large vasque mounted on twelve stone statues of lions. Water spouts upward in the vasque and pours from the mouths of the lions, filling four channels dividing the courtyard into quadrants.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, ''L'art des jardins en Europe'' . See also [http://www.alhambra-patronato.es/index.php See the official site of the Alhambra complex for the history of the fountains]&lt;/ref&gt;  The basin dates to the 14th century, but the lions spouting water are believed to be older, dating to the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Miller, ''Fountains as Metaphor'', in ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle -Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present'', edited by Marilyn Symmes, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the Islamic garden spread throughout the Islamic world, from Moorish Spain to the [[Mughal Empire]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] built by Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] in 1641, were said to be ornamented with 410 fountains, which fed into a large basin, canal and marble pools.

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], rulers often built fountains next to mosques so worshippers could do their ritual washing. Examples include the [[Fountain of Qasim Pasha]] (1527), [[Temple Mount]], [[Jerusalem]], an [[Wudu|ablution]] and drinking fountain built during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]; the [[Fountain of Ahmed III]] (1728) at the [[Topkapı Palace]], [[Istanbul]], another [[Fountain of Ahmed III (Üsküdar)|Fountain of Ahmed III]] in [[Üsküdar]] (1729) and [[Tophane Fountain]] (1732). Palaces themselves often had small decorated fountains, which provided drinking water, cooled the air, and made a pleasant splashing sound. One surviving example is the Fountain of Tears (1764) at the [[Bakhchisarai Palace]], in [[Crimea]]; which was made famous by a poem of [[Alexander Pushkin]].
The [[sebil (fountain)|sebil]] was a decorated fountain that was often the only source of water for the surrounding neighborhood.
It was often commissioned as an act of Islamic piety by a rich person.

===Renaissance fountains (15th–17th centuries)===
[[File:Tivoli, Villa d'Este, Querachse mit Neptunbrunnen und Wasserorgel 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Tivoli, Villa d'Este]]

In the 14th century, Italian humanist scholars began to rediscover and translate forgotten Roman texts on architecture by [[Vitruvius]], on hydraulics by [[Hero of Alexandria]], and descriptions of Roman gardens and fountains by [[Pliny the Younger]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Varro]]. The treatise on architecture, ''De re aedificatoria'', by [[Leon Battista Alberti]], which described in detail Roman villas, gardens and fountains, became the guidebook for Renaissance builders.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Attlee, ''Italian Gardens, A Cultural History'', pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (1397–1455), himself a scholar who commissioned hundreds of translations of ancient Greek classics into Latin, decided to embellish the city and make it a worthy capital of the Christian world. In 1453, he began to rebuild the [[Acqua Vergine]], the ruined Roman aqueduct which had brought clean drinking water to the city from eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) away. He also decided to revive the Roman custom of marking the arrival point of an aqueduct with a ''mostra'', a grand commemorative fountain. He commissioned the architect [[Leon Battista Alberti]] to build a wall fountain where the [[Trevi Fountain]] is now located. The aqueduct he restored, with modifications and extensions, eventually supplied water to the Trevi Fountain and the famous baroque fountains in the [[Piazza del Popolo]] and [[Piazza Navona]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, John A. ''The Trevi Fountain''. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first new fountains to be built in Rome during the Renaissance was the fountain in the piazza in front of the church of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] (1472), which was placed on the site of an earlier Roman fountain. Its design, based on an earlier Roman model, with a circular vasque on a pedestal pouring water into a basin below, became the model for many other fountains in Rome, and eventually for fountains in other cities, from Paris to London.&lt;ref&gt;The fountain in Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere originally had two upper basins, but the water pressure in the early Renaissance was so low that the water was unable to reach the upper basin, so the top basin was removed.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1503, [[Pope Julius II]] decided to recreate a classical pleasure garden in the same place. The new garden, called the [[Cortile del Belvedere]], was designed by [[Donato Bramante]]. The garden was decorated with the Pope's famous collection of classical statues, and with fountains. The Venetian Ambassador wrote in 1523, "...&amp;nbsp;On one side of the garden is a most beautiful loggia, at one end of which is a lovely fountain that irrigates the orange trees and the rest of the garden by a little canal in the center of the loggia&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;cited in Helena Attlee, ''Italian Gardens, a Cultural History'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  The original garden was split in two by the construction of the Vatican Library in the 16th century, but a new fountain by [[Carlo Maderno]] was built in the Cortile del Belvedere, with a jet of water shooting up from a circular stone bowl on an octagonal pedestal in a large basin.&lt;ref&gt;Symmes, ''Fountains – Splash and Spectacle'', pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1537, in [[Florence]], [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], who had become ruler of the city at the age of only 17, also decided to launch a program of aqueduct and fountain building. The city had previously gotten all its drinking water from wells and reservoirs of rain water, which meant that there was little water or water pressure to run fountains. Cosimo built an aqueduct large enough for the first continually-running fountain in Florence, the [[Fountain of Neptune, Florence|Fountain of Neptune]] in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] (1560–1567). This fountain featured an enormous white marble statue of Neptune, resembling Cosimo, by sculptor [[Bartolomeo Ammannati]].&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Symmes, ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle- Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present''. pg. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Medicis, fountains were not just sources of water, but advertisements of the power and benevolence of the city's rulers. They became central elements not only of city squares, but of the new [[Italian Renaissance garden]]. The great Medici Villa at Castello, built for Cosimo by [[Benedetto Varchi]], featured two monumental fountains on its central axis; one showing with two bronze figures representing [[Hercules]] slaying [[Antaeus]], symbolizing the victory of Cosimo over his enemies; and a second fountain, in the middle of a circular labyrinth of cypresses, laurel, myrtle and roses, had a bronze statue by [[Giambologna]] which showed the goddess [[Venus]] wringing her hair. The planet Venus was governed by [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], which was the emblem of Cosimo; the fountain symbolized that he was the absolute master of Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Attlee, ''Italian Gardens – A Cultural History'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle Renaissance, fountains had become a form of theater, with cascades and jets of water coming from marble statues of animals and mythological figures. The most famous fountains of this kind were found in the [[Villa d'Este]] (1550–1572), at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] near Rome, which featured a hillside of basins, fountains and jets of water, as well as a fountain which produced music by pouring water into a chamber, forcing air into a series of flute-like pipes. The gardens also featured ''giochi d'acqua'', water jokes, hidden fountains which suddenly soaked visitors.&lt;ref name="Attlee"&gt;Helena Attlee, ''Italian Gardens – A Cultural History''&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 1546 and 1549, the merchants of Paris built the first Renaissance-style fountain in Paris, the [[Fontaine des Innocents]], to commemorate the ceremonial entry of the King into the city. The fountain, which originally stood against the wall of the church of the Holy Innocents, as rebuilt several times and now stands in a square near [[Les Halles]]. It is the oldest fountain in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Boudon, "La Fontaine des Innocents", in ''Paris et ses fontaines, de la Renaissance à nos jours'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry constructed an Italian-style garden with a fountain shooting a vertical jet of water for his favorite mistress, [[Diane de Poitiers]], next to the [[Château de Chenonceau]] (1556–1559). At the royal [[Château de Fontainebleau]], he built another fountain with a bronze statue of [[Artemis|Diane]], goddess of the hunt, modeled after Diane de Poitiers.&lt;ref&gt;Le Guide du Patrimoine en France, Éditions du Patrimoine, Centre des Monuments Nationaux, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, after the death of Henry II, his widow, [[Catherine de Medici]], expelled Diane de Poitiers from Chenonceau and built her own fountain and garden there.

King [[Henry IV of France]] made an important contribution to French fountains by inviting an Italian hydraulic engineer, [[Tommaso Francini]], who had worked on the fountains of the villa at Pratalino, to make fountains in France. Francini became a French citizen in 1600, built the Medici Fountain, and during the rule of the young King [[Louis XIII]], he was raised to the position of Intendant général des Eaux et Fontaines of the king, a position which was hereditary. His descendants became the royal fountain designers for [[Louis XIII]] and for [[Louis XIV]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;A.

In 1630, another Medici, [[Marie de Medici]], the widow of Henry IV, built her own monumental fountain in Paris, the [[Medici Fountain]], in the garden of the [[Palais du Luxembourg]]. That fountain still exists today, with a long basin of water and statues added in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Gallo, ''La Présence italienne au 17&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'', in ''Paris et ses fontaines de la Renaissance à nos jours'', Collection Paris et son patrimoine,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baroque fountains (17th–18th century)===

====Baroque Fountains of Rome====
[[File:783RomaFontanaTrevi.JPG|thumb|300px|Fontana di Trevi, the [[Trevi Fountain]] by [[Nicola Salvi]], (1730).]]

The 17th and 18th centuries were a golden age for fountains in Rome, which began with the reconstruction of ruined Roman aqueducts and the construction by the Popes of ''mostra'', or display fountains, to mark their termini. The new fountains were expressions of the new [[Baroque]] art, which was officially promoted by the Catholic Church as a way to win popular support against the [[Protestant Reformation]]; the [[Council of Trent]] had declared in the 16th century that the Church should counter austere Protestantism with art that was lavish, animated and emotional. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of [[Rubens]], were examples of the principles of Baroque art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were "a visual representation of confidence and power."&lt;ref name="Attlee"/&gt;

The first of the [[Fountains of St. Peter's Square]], by [[Carlo Maderno]], (1614) was one of the earliest Baroque fountains in Rome, made to complement the lavish Baroque façade he designed for [[St. Peter's Basilica]] behind it. It was fed by water from the Paola aqueduct, restored in 1612, whose source was {{convert|266|ft|m}} above sea level, which meant it could shoot water twenty feet up from the fountain. Its form, with a large circular vasque on a pedestal pouring water into a basin and an inverted vasque above it spouting water, was imitated two centuries later in the Fountains of the [[Place de la Concorde]] in Paris.

The [[Triton Fountain]] in the [[Piazza Barberini]] (1642), by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], is a masterpiece of Baroque sculpture, representing [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], half-man and half-fish, blowing his horn to calm the waters, following a text by the Roman poet [[Ovid]] in the [[Metamorphoses]]. The Triton fountain benefited from its location in a valley, and the fact that it was fed by the Aqua Felice aqueduct, restored in 1587, which arrived in Rome at an elevation of {{convert|194|ft|m}} above sea level (fasl), a difference of {{convert|130|ft|m}} in elevation between the source and the fountain, which meant that the water from this fountain jetted sixteen feet straight up into the air from the conch shell of the triton.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Wentworth Rinne, ''The Fall and Rise of the Waters of Rome'', collected in Marilyn Symmes, ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle''. (pg. 54).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Piazza Navona]] became a grand theater of water, with three fountains, built in a line on the site of the [[Stadium of Domitian]]. The fountains at either end are by [[Giacomo della Porta]]; the [[Neptune]] fountain to the north, (1572) shows the God of the Sea spearing an octopus, surrounded by [[Triton (mythology)|tritons]], sea horses and [[mermaid]]s. At the southern end is Il Moro, possibly also a figure of Neptune riding a fish in a [[conch]] shell. In the center is the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]], (The Fountain of the Four Rivers) (1648–51), a highly theatrical fountain by Bernini, with statues representing rivers from the four continents; the [[Nile]], [[Danube]], [[Plate River]] and [[Ganges]]. Over the whole structure is a {{convert|54|ft|m|adj=on}} Egyptian [[obelisk]], crowned by a cross with the emblem of the [[Pamphili]] family, representing [[Pope Innocent X]], whose family palace was on the piazza. The theme of a fountain with statues symbolizing great rivers was later used in the Place de la Concorde (1836–40) and in the [[Neptunbrunnen|Fountain of Neptune]] in the [[Alexanderplatz]] in Berlin (1891). The fountains of Piazza Navona had one drawback - their water came from the Acqua Vergine, which had only a {{convert|23|ft|m|adj=on}} drop from the source to the fountains, which meant the water could only fall or trickle downwards, not jet very high upwards.&lt;ref&gt;Wentworth Rinne, ''The Fall and Rise of the Waters of Rome'', collected in Marilyn Symmes, ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle''. (pg. 54).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trevi Fountain]] is the largest and most spectacular of Rome's fountains, designed to glorify the three different Popes who created it. It was built beginning in 1730 at the terminus of the reconstructed [[Acqua Vergine]] aqueduct, on the site of Renaissance fountain by [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. It was the work of architect [[Nicola Salvi]] and the successive project of [[Pope Clement XII]], [[Pope Benedict XIV]] and [[Pope Clement XIII]], whose emblems and inscriptions are carried on the attic story, entablature and central niche. The central figure is [[Oceanus]], the personification of all the seas and oceans, in an oyster-shell chariot, surrounded by [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]] and Sea [[Nymphs]].

In fact, the fountain had very little water pressure, because the source of water was, like the source for the Piazza Navona fountains, the Acqua Vergine, with a {{convert|23|ft|m|adj=on}} drop. Salvi compensated for this problem by sinking the fountain down into the ground, and by carefully designing the cascade so that the water churned and tumbled, to add movement and drama.&lt;ref name="Prop"&gt;Maria Ann Conneli and Marilyn Symmes, ''Fountains as propaganda'', in ''Fountains, Splash and Spectacle – Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present.'' Edited by Marilyn Symmes. Thames and Hudson, London&lt;/ref&gt;  Wrote historians Maria Ann Conelli and Marilyn Symmes, "On many levels the Trevi altered the appearance, function and intent of fountains and was a watershed for future designs."&lt;ref&gt;Conelli and Symmes, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baroque fountains of Versailles====

Beginning in 1662, King [[Louis XIV of France]] began to build a new kind of garden, the [[Garden à la française]], or French formal garden, at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. In this garden, the fountain played a central role. He used fountains to demonstrate the power of man over nature, and to illustrate the grandeur of his rule. In the [[Gardens of Versailles]], instead of falling naturally into a basin, water was shot into the sky, or formed into the shape of a fan or bouquet. Dancing water was combined with music and fireworks to form a grand spectacle. These fountains were the work of the descendants of [[Tommaso Francini]], the Italian hydraulic engineer who had come to France during the time of Henry IV and built the [[Medici Fountain]] and the Fountain of Diana at [[Fontainebleau]].

Two fountains were the centerpieces of the Gardens of Versailles, both taken from the myths about Apollo, the sun god, the emblem of Louis XIV, and both symbolizing his power. The Fontaine Latone (1668–70) designed by [[André Le Nôtre]] and sculpted by Gaspard and Balthazar Marsy, represents the story of how the peasants of [[Lycia]] tormented [[Latona]] and her children, [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Apollo]], and were punished by being turned into frogs. This was a reminder of how French peasants had abused Louis's mother, [[Anne of Austria]], during the uprising called the [[Fronde]] in the 1650s. When the fountain is turned on, sprays of water pour down on the peasants, who are frenzied as they are transformed into creatures.&lt;ref name="Prop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, ''L'art des jardins en Europe''&lt;/ref&gt;

The other centerpiece of the Gardens, at the intersection of the main axes of the Gardens of Versailles, is the Bassin d'Apollon (1668–71), designed by [[Charles Le Brun]] and sculpted by Jean Baptiste Tuby. This statue shows a theme also depicted in the painted decoration in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles: Apollo in his chariot about to rise from the water, announced by Tritons with seashell trumpets. Historians Mary Anne Conelli and Marilyn Symmes wrote, "Designed for dramatic effect and to flatter the king, the fountain is oriented so that the Sun God rises from the west and travels east toward the chateau, in contradiction to nature."&lt;ref name="Prop"/&gt;

Besides these two monumental fountains, the Gardens over the years contained dozens of other fountains, including thirty-nine animal fountains in the [[labyrinth]] depicting the fables of [[Jean de La Fontaine]].

There were so many fountains at Versailles that it was impossible to have them all running at once; when Louis XIV made his promenades, his fountain-tenders turned on the fountains ahead of him and turned off those behind him. Louis built an enormous pumping station, the [[Machine de Marly]], with fourteen water wheels and 253 pumps to raise the water three hundred feet from the [[River Seine]], and even attempted to divert the River Eure to provide water for his fountains, but the water supply was never enough.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Berger, ''The Chateau of Louis XIV'', University Park, PA. 1985, and Gerald van der Kemp, ''Versailles'', New York, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baroque fountains of Peterhof====

In Russia, [[Peter the Great]] founded a new capital at [[St. Petersburg]] in 1703 and built a small Summer Palace and gardens there beside the [[Neva River]]. The gardens featured a fountain of two sea monsters spouting water, among the earliest fountains in Russia.

In 1709, he began constructing a larger palace, [[Peterhof Palace]], alongside the [[Gulf of Finland]], Peter visited France in 1717 and saw the gardens and fountains of Louis XIV at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], [[Marly-le-Roi|Marly]] and [[Fontainebleau]]. When he returned he began building a vast [[Garden à la française]] with fountains at Peterhof. The central feature of the garden was a water cascade, modeled after the cascade at the [[Château de Marly]] of Louis XIV, built in 1684. The gardens included trick fountains designed to drench unsuspecting visitors, a popular feature of the [[Italian Renaissance garden]].,&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Orloff and Dimitri Chvidkovski, ''Saint-Petersbourg, l'architecture des tsars'' Editions Place des Victoires, Paris, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1800–1802 the Emperor [[Paul I of Russia]] and his successor, [[Alexander I of Russia]], built a new fountain at the foot of the cascade depicting [[Samson]] prying open the mouth of a lion, representing Peter's victory over [[Sweden]] in the [[Great Northern War]] in 1721. The fountains were fed by reservoirs in the upper garden, while the Samson fountain was fed by a specially-constructed aqueduct four kilometers in length.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the early 19th century, London and Paris built aqueducts and new fountains to supply clean drinking water to their exploding populations. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] started construction on the first canals bringing drinking water to Paris, fifteen new fountains, the most famous being the [[Fontaine du Palmier]] in the [[Place du Châtelet]], (1896–1808), celebrating his military victories.

He also restored and put back into service some of the city's oldest fountains, such as the [[Medici Fountain]]. Two of Napoleon's fountains, the Chateau d'Eau and the fountain in the Place des Vosges, were the first purely decorative fountains in Paris, without water taps for drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;Katia Frey, ''L'enterprise napoléonienne'', in ''Paris et ses fontaines'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis-Philippe]] (1830–1848) continued Napoleon's work, and added some of Paris's most famous fountains, notably the [[Fontaines de la Concorde]] (1836–1840) and the fountains in the Place des Vosges.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Lamoitier, ''L'Essor des fontaines monumentales'', in ''Paris et ses fontaines''. pg. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a deadly cholera epidemic in 1849, [[Louis Napoleon]] decided to completely rebuild the Paris water supply system, separating the water supply for fountains from the water supply for drinking. The most famous fountain built by Louis Napoleon was the [[Fontaine Saint-Michel]], part of his grand reconstruction of Paris boulevards. Louis Napoleon relocated and rebuilt several earlier fountains, such as the [[Medici Fountain]] and the [[Fontaine de Leda]], when their original sites were destroyed by his construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice LaMoitier, "Le Règne de Davioud", in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-nineteenth century the first fountains were built in the United States, connected to the first aqueducts bringing drinking water from outside the city. The first fountain in Philadelphia, at [[Philadelphia City Hall|Centre Square]], opened in 1809, and featured a statue by sculptor [[William Rush]]. The first fountain in New York City, in [[City Hall Park]], opened in 1842, and the first fountain in Boston was turned on in 1848. The first famous American decorative fountain was the [[Bethesda Fountain]] in Central Park in New York City, opened in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Burns and James Sanders, ''New York, an Illustrated History'', Alfred Knopf, New Yorkm, 1999, pg. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century also saw the introduction of new materials in fountain construction; cast iron (the [[Fontaines de la Concorde]]); glass (the Crystal Fountain in London (1851)) and even aluminium (the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in [[Picadilly Circus]], London, (1897)).&lt;ref name="Stephen Astley 1998"&gt;Stephen Astley, ''The Fountains in Trafalagar Square'', in ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle – Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present'', edited by Marilyn Symmes, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of steam pumps meant that water could be supplied directly to homes, and pumped upward from fountains. The new fountains in Trafalgar Square (1845) used steam pumps from an artesian well. By the end of the 19th century fountains in big cities were no longer used to supply drinking water, and were simply a form of art and urban decoration.&lt;ref name="Stephen Astley 1998"/&gt;

Another fountain innovation of the 19th century was the illuminated fountain: The [[Bartholdi Fountain]] at the [[Philadelphia Exposition of 1876]] was illuminated by gas lamps. In 1884 a fountain in Britain featured electric lights shining upward through the water. The [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]] which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution featured a fountain illuminated by electric lights shining up though the columns of water. The fountains, located in a basin forty meters in diameter, were given color by plates of colored glass inserted over the lamps. The Fountain of Progress gave its show three times each evening, for twenty minutes, with a series of different colors.&lt;ref&gt;Virginie Grandval, ''Fontaines éphéméres'', in ''Paris et ses fontaine''s, pg. 209–247&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Paris fountains in the 20th century no longer had to supply drinking water - they were purely decorative; and, since their water usually came from the river and not from the city aqueducts, their water was no longer drinkable. Twenty-eight new fountains were built in Paris between 1900 and 1940; nine new fountains between 1900 and 1910; four between 1920 and 1930; and fifteen between 1930 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Figures cited by Pauline Prevost-Marcilhacy, Doctor of the History of Art at the University of Paris IV - Sorbonne, in her essay on fountains, ''1900-1940- Entre tradition et modernité'', in ''Paris et ses fontaines'', pg. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest fountains of the period were those built for the International Expositions of 1900, 1925 and 1937, and for the Colonial Exposition of 1931. Of those, only the fountains from the 1937 exposition at the [[Palais de Chaillot]] still exist. (See [[Fountains of International Expositions]]).

Only a handful of fountains were built in Paris between 1940 and 1980. The most important ones built during that period were on the edges of the city, on the west, just outside the city limits, at [[La Défense]], and to the east at the [[Bois de Vincennes]].

Between 1981 and 1995, during the terms of President [[François Mitterrand]] and Culture Minister [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]], and of Mitterrand's bitter political rival, Paris Mayor [[Jacques Chirac]] (Mayor from 1977 until 1995), the city experienced a program of monumental fountain building that exceeded that of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] or [[Louis Philippe]]. More than one hundred fountains were built in Paris in the 1980s, mostly in the neighborhoods outside the center of Paris, where there had been few fountains before These included the Fontaine Cristaux, homage to [[Béla Bartók]] by [[Jean-Yves Lechevallier]] (1980);  the [[Stravinsky Fountain]] next to the [[Pompidou Center]], by sculptors [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Jean Tinguely]] (1983); the fountain of the Pyramid of the Louvre by [[I.M. Pei]], (1989), the Buren Fountain by sculptor [[Daniel Buren]],  Les Sphérades fountain, both in the [[Palais-Royal]], and the fountains of [[Parc André-Citroën]]. The Mitterrand-Chirac fountains had no single style or theme. Many of the fountains were designed by famous sculptors or architects, such as [[Jean Tinguely]], [[I.M. Pei]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Daniel Buren]], who had radically different ideas of what a fountain should be. Some were solemn, and others were whimsical. Most made little effort to blend with their surroundings - they were designed to attract attention.

Few new fountains have been built in Paris since 2000. The most notable is [[La Danse de la fontaine emergente]] (2008), located on Place Augusta-Holmes, rue Paul Klee, in the 13th arrondissement. It was designed by the French-Chinese sculptor Chen Zhen (1955–2000), shortly before his death in 2000, and finished through the efforts of his spouse and collaborator. It shows a dragon, in stainless steel, glass and plastic, emerging and submerging from the pavement of the square. Water under pressure flows through the transparent skin of the dragon.

Fountains built in the United States between 1900 and 1950 mostly followed European models and classical styles.
The ''[[DuPont Circle Fountain|Samuel Francis Dupont Memorial Fountain]]'', in [[Dupont Circle]], [[Washington D.C.]], was designed and created by [[Henry Bacon]] and [[Daniel Chester French]], the architect and sculptor of the [[Lincoln Memorial]], in 1921, in a pure [[Neoclassical sculpture|neoclassical]] style.

The ''[[Buckingham Fountain]]'' in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] in Chicago was one of the first American fountains to use powerful modern pumps to shoot water as high as {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} into the air.
The ''Fountain of Prometheus,'' built at the [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]] in 1933, was the first American fountain in the [[Art-Deco]] style.

After World War II, fountains in the United States became more varied in form. Some, like the [[Vaillancourt Fountain]] in [[San Francisco]] (1971), were pure works of sculpture. Other fountains, like the ''Frankin Roosevelt Memorial Waterfall'' (1997), by architect [[Lawrence Halprin]], were designed as landscapes to illustrate themes. This fountain is part of the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial]] in [[Washington D.C.]], which has four outdoor "rooms" illustrating his Presidency. Each "room" contains a cascade or waterfall; the cascade in the third room illustrates the turbulence of the years of the World War II. Halprin wrote at an early stage of the design; "the whole environment of the memorial becomes sculpture: to touch, feel, hear and contact - with all the senses."&lt;ref&gt;Halprin, Lawrence, Notebooks 1959–1971, Cambridge Massachusetts (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the 20th century the development of high-shooting fountains, beginning with the [[Jet d'eau]] in [[Geneva]] in 1951, and followed by taller and taller fountains in the United States and the Middle East. The highest fountain today in the [[King Fahd's Fountain]] in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]].

It also saw the increasing popularity of the musical fountain, which combined water, music and light, choreographed by computers.  (See [[Musical fountain]] below).

The fountain called Bit. Fall by German artist [[Julius Popp]] (2005) uses digital technologies to spell out words with water. The fountain is run by a statistical program which selects words at random from news stories on the Internet. It then recodes these words into pictures. Then 320 nozzles inject the water into electromagnetic valves. The program uses [[rasterization]] and [[bitmap]] technologies to synchronize the valves so drops of water form an image of the words as they fall. According to Popp, the sheet of water is "a metaphor for the constant flow of information from which we cannot escape."&lt;ref&gt;From the label on the fountain displayed at the Moscow bienalle of contemporary art, October 2009.

[[La Danse de la fontaine emergente]], Place Augusta-Holmes, Paris (13th arrondissement) (2008), is the newest fountain in Paris. The fountain is designed to resemble a [[dragon]] winding its way around the square, emerging and submerging from the pavement. The skin of the dragon is transparent, showing the water flowing within. The water flowing within the dragon is under pressure and is illuminated at night. It is constructed of stainless steel, glass, and plastic. It was designed by the French-Chinese sculptor Chen Zhen (1955–2000)

The fountain is in three parts. A bas-relief of the dragon is fixed on the wall of the structure of the water-supply plant, and the dragon seems to be emerging from the wall and plunging underground. This part of the dragon is opaque. The second and third parts depict the arch of the dragon's back coming out of the pavement. These parts of the dragon are transparent, and water under pressure flows within, and is illuminated at night.&lt;!-- &lt;gallery&gt;

==Musical fountains==
[[Musical fountain]]s create a theatrical spectacle with music, light and water, usually employing a variety of programmable spouts and water jets controlled by a computer.

Musical fountains were first described in the 1st century AD by the Greek scientist and engineer [[Hero of Alexandria]] in his book ''Pneumatics''. Hero described and provided drawings of "A bird made to whistle by flowing water," "A Trumpet sounded by flowing water," and "Birds made to sing and be silent alternately by flowing water."  In Hero's descriptions, water pushed air through musical instruments to make sounds. It is not known if Hero made working models of any of his designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/hero/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208040820/http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/hero/index.html |archivedate=8 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Italian Renaissance]], the most famous musical fountains were located in the gardens of the [[Villa d'Este]], in [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]]. which were created between 1550 and 1572. Following the ideas of Hero of Alexandria, the Fountain of the Owl used a series of bronze pipes like flutes to make the sound of birds. The most famous feature of the garden was the great Organ Fountain. It was described by the French philosopher [[Michel de Montaigne]], who visited the garden in 1580: "The music of the Organ Fountain is true music, naturally created&amp;nbsp;... made by water which falls with great violence into a cave, rounded and vaulted, and agitates the air, which is forced to exit through the pipes of an organ. Other water, passing through a wheel, strikes in a certain order the keyboard of the organ. The organ also imitates the sound of trumpets, the sound of cannon, and the sound of muskets, made by the sudden fall of water&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, M. E.. de, ''Journal de voyage en Italie'', Le Livre de poche, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The Organ Fountain fell into ruins, but it was recently restored and plays music again.

[[Louis XIV]] created the idea of the modern musical fountain by staging spectacles in the [[Gardens of Versailles]], using music and fireworks to accompany the flow of the fountains.

The great international expositions held in Philadelphia, London and Paris featured the ancestors of the modern musical fountain. They introduced the first fountains illuminated by gas lights (Philadelphia in 1876); and the first fountains illuminated by electric lights (London in 1884 and Paris in 1889).&lt;ref&gt;''Fontaines éphéméres'', in ''Paris et ses fontaine''s, pg. 209–247&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]] in Paris featured fountains illuminated by colored lights controlled by a keyboard.&lt;ref name="Virginie Grandval, pg. 229"&gt;Virginie Grandval, pg. 229&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Paris Colonial Exposition]] of 1931 presented the Théâtre d'eau, or water theater, located in a lake, with performance of dancing water. The [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)]] had combined arches and columns of water from fountains in the Seine with light, and with music from loudspeakers on eleven rafts anchored in the river, playing the music of the leading composers of the time. (See International Exposition Fountains, above.)

Today some of the best-known musical fountains in the world are at the [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio Hotel &amp; Casino]] in Las Vegas, (2009); the [[Dubai Fountain]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]; the [[World of Color]] at [[Disney California Adventure Park]] (2010) and [[Aquanura]] at the [[Efteling]] in the [[Netherlands]] (2012).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Splash fountains==
[[File:Fountain in Krasnodar.jpg|thumb|The Splash Fountain in [[Krasnodar]], Russia.]]
A [[splash pad|splash fountain]] or [[bathing]] fountain is intended for people to come in and cool off on hot summer days. These fountains are also referred to as interactive fountains. These fountains are designed to allow easy access, and feature nonslip surfaces, and have no standing water, to eliminate possible drowning hazards, so that no lifeguards or supervision is required. These splash pads are often located in public pools, public parks, or public playgrounds (known as "spraygrounds"). In some splash fountains, such as [[Dundas Square]] in Toronto, Canada, the water is heated by solar energy captured by the special dark-colored granite slabs. The fountain at Dundas Square features 600 ground nozzles arranged in groups of 30 (3 rows of 10 nozzles). Each group of 30 nozzles is located beneath a stainless steel grille. Twenty such grilles are arranged in two rows of 10, in the middle of the main walkway through Dundas Square.

==Drinking fountain==
{{main article|Drinking fountain}}
A water fountain or drinking fountain is designed to provide drinking water and has a basin arrangement with either continuously running water or a [[Tap (valve)|tap]]. The drinker bends down to the stream of water and swallows water directly from the stream. Modern indoor drinking fountains may incorporate [[filter (water)|filter]]s to remove impurities from the water and chillers to reduce its temperature. In some regional dialects, water fountains are called ''[[bubbler]]s''. Water fountains are usually found in public places, like schools, rest areas, libraries, and grocery stores. Many jurisdictions require water fountains to be wheelchair accessible (by sticking out horizontally from the wall), and to include an additional unit of a lower height for children and short adults. The design that this replaced often had one spout atop a refrigeration unit.

In 1859, [[Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association|The Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association]] was established to promote the provision of drinking water for people and animals in the United Kingdom and overseas. More recently, in 2010, the FindaFountain campaign was launched in the UK to encourage people to use drinking fountains instead of environmentally damaging bottled water. A map showing the location of UK drinking water fountains is published on the FindaFountain website.

==How fountains work==
[[File:Fountain (7683094886).jpg|thumb|Illuminated fountain]] 
[[File:18th Century Fountain Nozzles.jpg|thumb|The book "The Theory and Practice of Gardening" by [[Dezallier d'Argenville]] (1709) showed different types of fountain nozzles which would create different shapes of water, from bouquets to fans.]]

From Roman times until the end of the 19th century, fountains operated by gravity, requiring a source of water higher than the fountain itself to make the water flow. The greater the difference between the elevation of the source of water and the fountain, the higher the water would go upwards from the fountain.

In Roman cities, water for fountains came from lakes and rivers and springs in the hills, brought into city in aqueducts and then distributed to fountains through a system of lead pipes.

From the Middle Ages onwards, fountains in villages or towns were connected to springs, or to channels which brought water from lakes or rivers. In Provence, a typical village fountain consisted of a pipe or underground duct from a spring at a higher elevation than the fountain. The water from the spring flowed down to the fountain, then up a tube into a bulb-shaped stone vessel, like a large vase with a cover on top. The inside of the vase, called the ''bassin de répartition'', was filled with water up to a level just above the mouths of the canons, or spouts, which slanted downwards. The water poured down through the canons, creating a siphon, so that the fountain ran continually.

In cities and towns, residents filled vessels or jars of water jets from the canons of the fountain or paid a water porter to bring the water to their home. Horses and domestic animals could drink the water in the basin below the fountain. The water not used often flowed into a separate series of basins, a lavoir, used for washing and rinsing clothes. After being used for washing, the same water then ran through a channel to the town's kitchen garden. In Provence, since clothes were washed with ashes, the water that flowed into the garden contained potassium, and was valuable as fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Plantier"/&gt;

The most famous fountains of the Renaissance, at the Villa d'Este in Tivoli, were located on a steep slope near a river; the builders ran a channel from the river to a large fountain at top of the garden, which then fed other fountains and basins on the levels below. The fountains of Rome, built from the Renaissance through the 18th century, took their water from rebuilt Roman aqueducts which brought water from lakes and rivers at a higher elevation than the fountains. Those fountains with a high source of water, such as the [[Triton Fountain]], could shoot water {{convert|16|ft|m}} in air. Fountains with a lower source, such as the Trevi Fountain, could only have water pour downwards. The architect of the [[Trevi Fountain]] placed it below street level to make the flow of water seem more dramatic.

The fountains of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] depended upon water from reservoirs just above the fountains. As [[King Louis XIV]] built more fountains, he was forced to construct an enormous complex of pumps, called the [[Machine de Marly]], with fourteen water wheels and 220 pumps, to raise water 162&amp;nbsp;meters above the Seine River to the reservoirs to keep his fountains flowing. Even with the Machine de Marly, the fountains used so much water that they could not be all turned on at the same time. Fontainiers watched the progress of the King when he toured the gardens and turned on each fountain just before he arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Symmes, "Fountains as Propaganda," in "Fountains, Splash and Spectacle," pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

The architects of the fountains at Versailles designed specially-shaped nozzles, or tuyaux, to form the water into different shapes, such as fans, bouquests, and umbrellas.

In Germany, some courts and palace gardens were situated in flat areas, thus fountains depending on pumped pressurized water were developed at a fairly early point in history. The Great Fountain in [[Herrenhausen Gardens]] at [[Hanover]] was based on ideas of [[Gottfried Leibniz]] conceived in 1694 and was inaugurated in 1719 during the visit of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]. After some improvements, it reached a height of some 35&amp;nbsp;m in 1721 which made it the highest fountain in European courts. The fountains at the [[Nymphenburg Palace]] initially were fed by water pumped to water towers, but as from 1803 were operated by the water powered [[Pumping Stations at the Nymphenburg Palace|Nymphenburg Pumping Stations]] which are still working.

Beginning in the 19th century, fountains ceased to be used for drinking water and became purely ornamental. By the beginning of the 20th century, cities began using steam pumps and later electric pumps to send water to the city fountains. Later in the 20th century, urban fountains began to recycle their water through a closed [[wiktionary:circulation|recirculating system]]. An electric pump, often placed under the water, pushes the water through the pipes. The water must be regularly topped up to offset water lost to evaporation, and allowance must be made to handle overflow after heavy rain.

In modern fountains a [[Filter (water)|water filter]], typically a [[media filter]], removes particles from the water—this filter requires its own pump to force water through it and plumbing to remove the water from the pool to the filter and then back to the pool. The water may need chlorination or anti-algal treatment, or may use biological methods to filter and clean water.

The [[pump]]s, filter, electrical switch box and plumbing controls are often housed in a "plant room".
Low-voltage lighting, typically 12 [[volt]] [[direct current]], is used to minimise electrical hazards. Lighting is often submerged and must be suitably designed. High wattage lighting (incandescent and halogen) either as [[submerged lighting]] or [[accent lighting]] on waterwall fountains have been implicated in every documented [[Legionnaires' disease]] outbreak associated with fountains. This is detailed in the "Guidelines for Control of Legionella in Ornamental Features".
Floating fountains are also popular for ponds and lakes; they consist of a float pump nozzle and water chamber.

{{Life in the African Union}}
{{Main|Geography of Africa}}
[[File:Location of the African Union.svg|thumb|300px|right|The African Union in location to the rest of the world.]]
The '''[[African Union]]''' covers almost the entirety of continental [[Africa]] and several off-shore islands. Consequently, it is wildly diverse, including the world's largest hot [[desert]] (the [[Sahara]]), huge [[jungle]]s and [[savanna]]s, and the world's longest river (the [[Nile]]).

==Overview==
The AU presently has an area of  29,922,059&amp;nbsp;km² (18,592,705&amp;nbsp;mi²), with 24,165&amp;nbsp;km² (15,015&amp;nbsp;mi²) of coastline. The vast majority of this area is on [[continent]]al Africa, while the only significant territory off the mainland is the island of [[Madagascar]] ([[List of islands by area|the world's fourth largest]]), accounting for slightly less than 2% of the total.

==Countries bordering the African Union==
The AU has two land borders: [[Morocco]] borders the Spanish semi-enclaves of [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]], and [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera]]  and [[Egypt]]'s [[Sinai Peninsula]] borders the [[Gaza Strip]] for 11&amp;nbsp;km (6.8&amp;nbsp;mi) and [[Israel]] for 400&amp;nbsp;km (248&amp;nbsp;mi) on its western frontier. Since it is [[Asia]]n, the Sinai is the only territorial region of the AU on another geopolitical [[continent]].

The '''Governorates of the Gaza Strip''' are 5 administrative districts, ruled since 2007 by the [[Hamas Government in Gaza]]. After the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] in 1993, the [[Palestinian territories]] of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] were divided into three areas ([[Administrative divisions of the Oslo Accords|Area A, Area B, and Area C]]) and 16 [[governorate]]s under the jurisdiction of the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. In 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip, enlarging the administered Palestinian territories in that region. In 2007, following the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|War of Brothers]] in the Gaza Strip between Fatah and Hamas, the later took over the area and expelled all Palestinian Authority officials, affiliated with Fatah.

[[File:Guerilla Gardening in front of Flying Pigeon LA.jpg|thumb|250px|Guerrilla gardening on a Los Angeles street.]]
'''Guerrilla gardening''' is the act of [[gardening]] on land that the [[gardener]]s do not have the legal rights to cultivate, such as abandoned sites, areas that are not being cared for, or private property. It encompasses a diverse range of people and motivations, ranging from gardeners who spill over their legal boundaries to gardeners with political influences who seek to provoke change by using guerrilla gardening as a form of [[protest]] or [[direct action]]. This practice has implications for [[land rights]] and [[land reform]]; aiming to promote re-consideration of [[Land ownership and tenure|land ownership]] in order to assign a new purpose or reclaim land that is perceived to be in neglect or misused.
 
The land that is guerrilla gardened is usually abandoned or perceived to be neglected by its legal owner. That land is used by guerrilla gardeners to raise plants, frequently focusing on [[food crops]] or plants intended for aesthetic purposes, like [[flowers]].

Some guerrilla gardeners carry out their actions at night, in relative secrecy, to sow and tend a new vegetable patch or [[flower garden]] in an effort to make the area of use and/or more attractive. Some garden at more visible hours for the purpose of publicity, which can be seen as a form of [[activism]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:Guerrilla gardening.jpg|thumb|250px|Guerrilla gardeners planting vegetables on previously empty space in downtown [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada.]]

The earliest recorded use of the term ''guerrilla gardening'' was by Liz Christy and her [[Liz Christy Garden|Green Guerrilla group in 1973 in the Bowery Houston area of New York]]. They transformed a derelict private lot into a garden.&lt;ref&gt;Lamborn, P., and Weinberg, B. (Eds.), (1999), ''Avant Gardening: Ecological Struggle in The City and The World''. Autonomedia. {{ISBN|1-57027-092-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space is still cared for by volunteers but now enjoys the protection of the city's parks department. Two celebrated guerrilla gardeners, active prior to the coining of the term, were [[Gerrard Winstanley]], of [[Diggers|the Diggers]] in [[Surrey]], England (1649), and [[Johnny Appleseed|John "Appleseed" Chapman]] in [[Ohio]], USA (1801).

Guerrilla gardening takes place in many parts of the world - more than thirty countries are documented&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, R. (2008), ''On Guerrilla Gardening: A Handbook For Gardening Without Boundaries''. Bloomsbury {{ISBN|978-0-7475-9297-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and evidence can be found online in numerous guerrilla gardening social networking groups and in the Community pages of GuerrillaGardening.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guerrillagardening.org/community/index.php |title=Index |publisher=guerrillagardening.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''bewildering'' has been used as a synonym for guerrilla gardening by Australian gardener Bob Crombie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/on-the-verge-of-a-revolution/2008/02/19/1203190824164.html?page=2 |title='&amp;#39;On the verge of a revolution'&amp;#39;, Sydney Morning Herald, 20 February 2008 |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===International Sunflower Guerrilla Gardening Day===
The International Sunflower Guerrilla Gardening Day, scheduled on the 1st of May of every year, is an annual international event when guerrilla gardeners plant sunflowers in their neighborhoods, typically in public places perceived to be neglected, such as tree pits, flower beds and roadside verges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guerrillagardening.org/ggsunflower.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323183046/http://www.guerrillagardening.org/ggsunflower.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-03-23|title=International Sunflower Guerrilla Gardening Day|publisher=Guerrillagardening.org|date=|accessdate=2011-01-31}} {{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has taken place since 2007, and was conceived by guerrilla gardeners in Brussels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brussels-farmer.blogspot.com/2007_04_01_archive.html |title=Brussels Farmer: avril 2007|publisher=Brussels-farmer.blogspot.com |date=2004-02-23 |accessdate=2011-01-31}} {{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who go by the name of The Brussels Farmers). They declared it ''Journée Internationale de la Guérilla Tournesol''. It has been championed by guerrilla gardeners around the world, notably by GuerrillaGardening.org &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz_gRZgl_Wo |title=GGTV International Sunflower Guerrilla Gardening Day Video Tutorial |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participation has grown each year since then. Although sunflower sowing at this time of the year is limited to relatively temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere, this day is also marked in other parts of the world by planting plants appropriate to the season.

{{main|Adam Purple}}
From the mid-1970s, [[Adam Purple]] created and tended a circular garden (shaped like a [[Yin and yang|yin-yang]]) in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, in an abandoned lot. In 1986, when it was bulldozed by the City of New York, the garden had overtaken many lots and reached a size of 15,000 square feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.archpaper.com/wordpress/archives/12920 |title=A/N Blog .

====People's Park (Berkeley, California)====
{{main|People's Park (Berkeley)}}
People's Park in [[Berkeley, California]] is now a de facto public park which was formed directly out of a community guerrilla gardening movement during the late 1960s which took place on land owned by the University of California. The university acquired the land through [[eminent domain]], and the houses on the land were demolished, but the university did not allocate funds to develop the land, and the land was left in a decrepit state.

Eventually, people began to convert the unused land into a park. This led to an embattled history involving community members, the university, university police, [[Ronald Reagan|Governor Reagan]], and the national guard, where protest and bloody reprisal left one person dead, and hundreds seriously wounded. Parts of the park were destroyed and rebuilt over time, and it has established itself into a permanent part of the city.

====Greenaid (Los Angeles)====
Greenaid is a [[Los Angeles]] based organization founded in 2010 by Daniel Phillips and Kim Karlsrud of Common Studio. The organization converts vintage gumball machines to dispense [[seed ball]]s, a combination of clay, compost and region-specific seeds. Once dispensed, seed balls are tossed or planted in any area that may benefit from wildflowers ([[Seed bombing]]). Greenaid partners with business owners, educators and citizens to distribute seedbomb vending machines in various communities worldwide. With region-specific seedbomb mixes, Greenaid aims to integrate and beautify rather than disrupt traditionally bland urban areas such as sidewalks and highway medians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====L.A. Green Grounds====
Designer [[Ron Dunn]] pioneered the growing produce on a strip of parkway lawn but came into conflict with the city council.  He was successful in maintaining this urban market garden and has promoted the idea with a [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk and appearances at international conferences such as the Stockholm Food Forum and MAD in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.losangelesregister.com/articles/finley-599328-ted-garden.html |title=The veggie king of South Central |date=May 13, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04hmnnf |publisher=BBC |title=Food is MAD |work=Food Programme |date=21 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SoCal Guerrilla Gardening====
Developing the '''Clean, Green, and Glean''' method of Guerrilla Gardening Scott Bunnell has been refining guerrilla gardening methods for over 30 years. In 2008 he started the SoCal Guerrilla Gardening Club adding more drought tolerant gardens. Having dozens of guerrilla gardens in Los Angeles County. Several gardens in each of the cities of Hollywood, Eagle Rock, Pico Rivera, Whittier, Long Beach, Norwalk, Artesia, Venice, the Skid Row area of Los Angeles. In 2015 SoCal also planted a guerrilla "satellite" garden in Morro Bay, Ca. with our sister club the Morro Bay Guerrilla Gardening Club. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-hm-guerrilla29-2008may29-story.html| title=Guerrilla gardener movement takes root in L.A. area | date=May 29, 2008 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/socal-connected/guerrilla-gardeners-3 |title= Guerrilla Gardeners |date= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Utah====
In Northern [[Utah]], [[apple]] trees commonly grow along the banks of canals. [[Asparagus]] grows along the smaller ditch banks. Many of these plants were seeded 150 years ago by the workers who dug the canals, by burying their lunch apple core in the freshly dug soil or by surreptitiously spreading seeds along a new ditchbank.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Guerrilla gardening continues today, as individuals secretly plant fruit trees, edible perennials, and flowers in parks, along bike trails, etc. Some guerrilla gardeners do so for the purpose of providing food. For example, the Tacamiche [[banana]] [[plantation]] workers in [[Honduras]] illegally grew vegetables on the abandoned plantation land, rather than leave with the plantation's closure in 1995.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

====Seattle, Washington====
In 2009, as a collaboration between [[World Naked Bike Ride Seattle]], Body Freedom Collaborative, and [[World Naked Gardening Day]], permaculturists Kelda Lorax and Jacob Gabriel launched [[World Naked Gardening Day#Gardens Everywhere Bike Parade|Gardens Everywhere Bike Parade]], a [[permaculture]]-themed [[clothing-optional bike ride]] that spontaneously showed up at neighborhood gardening locations.

===="Guerrilla Park" (Welland, ON, Canada)====

[[File:Guerrilla Park, Welland.jpg|thumb|250px|"Art at the Park" at Guerrilla Park in Welland, Ontario in 2015.]]

Whereas most areas that are subjected to guerrilla gardening are unused or abandoned areas not designated for parkland or green space, this is an exception in that it was initially designed for such a purpose. Originally a maintained parkette in [[Welland]], this small area along the [[Welland Recreational Waterway]] fell into disuse and neglect for a number of years. In 2013, a handful of local residents, including visual artists and guerrilla gardeners, reclaimed the space by fully restoring overgrown flower beds, adding outdoor paintings, and overseeing general landscape maintenance. Although this area is officially municipal property, there was initially a question by volunteers as to which local organization was responsible for this parkette's maintenance (whether responsibility fell into hands of [[Welland Recreational Canal Corporation]] or [[City of Welland]] Parks Department). Volunteers met with representatives of City of Welland, and an unofficial verbal agreement was made, ensuring that although the City of Welland does own the parkette land, volunteers may continue maintenance and gardening in the area. Currently, the area does attract some local artistic, musical, and creative youth. It has also been the setting for a number of small unorganized or impromptu events, such as art shows. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niagarathisweek.com/community-story/4575625-guerilla-gardeners-transform-park/|title=Guerrilla Gardeners Transform Park|last=Henschel|first=Steve|date=Jun 12, 2014|work=Niagara This Week|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wellandtribune.ca/2017/04/09/canal-side-park-gets-spring-makeover|title=Canal Side Park Gets Spring Makeover|last=Barton|first=Laura|date=April 9, 2017|work=The Welland Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wellandtribune.ca/2015/05/21/art-to-take-over-guerrilla-garden|title=Art to Take Over Guerrilla Garden|last=Tribune Staff|first=|date=May 21, 2015|work=The Welland Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Garden in a night" (Denmark)====
In 1996, Have på en nat ("Garden in a night") was made by the Danish Økologiske Igangsættere ("Organic starters"). An empty piece of land in the middle of the city at Guldbergsgade in [[Nørrebro]], [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, was transformed into a garden in a single night. About 1,000 people took part in the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.information.dk/47309&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, his motivations were simply those of a frustrated gardener looking to beautify the neighborhood, but his website attracted the interest of fellow guerrilla gardeners in London and beyond, as well as the world's media. Reynolds's guerrilla gardening has now reached many pockets of South London, and news of his activity has inspired people around the world to get involved. He also works alongside other troops, some local and some who travel to participate. He has also guerrilla-gardened in Libya, Berlin and Montreal.

Today, GuerrillaGardening.org is still his blog but also includes tips, links and thriving community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guerrillagardening.org/community/index.php |title=Community |publisher=Guerrillagardening.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; boards where guerrilla gardeners from around the world are finding supportive locals.

====Leaf Street Community Garden (Manchester)====
Leaf Street is an acre of land in [[Hulme]], [[Manchester]], England, that was once an urban street until turfed over by [[Manchester City Council]]. Local people, facilitated by Manchester Permaculture Group, took direct action in turning the site into a thriving [[community garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodfutures.info/site/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=53 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101115026/http://www.foodfutures.info/site/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=53 |archivedate=2008-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kew Bridge Eco Village, London, England====
In July 2009, land rights activists moved on to a derelict piece of land near [[Kew Gardens]] in West London. [[Kew Bridge Eco Village]] was a small community of squatters who grew vegetables and built basic wooden dwellings on the land.

===Australia===
Guerrilla gardening is prominent in [[Melbourne]] where most of the inner northern suburbs have community vegetable gardens; land adjoining rail lines has undergone regeneration of the native vegetation, including nature strips. There are a few minor disputes between guerrilla gardeners in Melbourne, with most falling into one of two groups: those concerned most with native planting and those concerned most with communal food growing. However, people with differing opinions still work together without dispute.&lt;ref&gt;''The Age'', Article "Gardening guerrilla's in our midst", 10/12/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are small community groups around Australia called "Permablitz" who gather regularly to design and construct suburban vegetable gardens for free, in an effort to educate residents on how to grow their own food and better prepare them if/when food prices become too expensive.

Australian [[Network 10]]'s show ''[[Guerrilla Gardeners]]'' featured a team of gardeners who make over areas of council owned property without them knowing.

'''Kevin Hoffman Walk'''

Kevin Hoffman Walk is a passive, scenic linear trail with significant indigenous vegetation, lush ground covers, flowering native shrubs and trees, that overlook part of the tranquil Hovells Creek in Lara Victoria. Originally inspired and maintained by Kevin Hoffman and his family in the early 1970s and with the support of the then Shire of Corio they commenced working together.

===New Zealand===

====Vacant Lot Of Cabbages (1978)====
In 1978 in downtown Wellington New Zealand artist Barry Thomas, in collaboration with Chris Lipscombe, Hugh Walton and others, planted 180 cabbages "on the demolished Duke of Edinburgh/Roxy Theatre site in the centre of Wellington. This cabbage patch, planted in such a way as to spell the word CABBAGE immediately captured the imagination of both the media and the public and engendered a flurry of other activities on the site, culminating in a week-long festival... when the cabbages were ceremonially harvested."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues1to40/exhibitions10wnnr.htm |title=The Artists' Co-op: Barry Thomas; Eva Yuen; Ian Hunter; Ross Boyd; Terry Handscombe; Robin White |publisher=Art New Zealand (Winter, 1978)}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a work of conceptual sculpture, this intervention is also an early example of guerrilla gardening in New Zealand. Thomas' work remained for six months, "astonishingly unvandalised, as a living, breathing sculpture in the heart of the city." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues1to40/exhibitions10wnnr.htm |title=The Artists' Co-op: Barry Thomas; Eva Yuen; Ian Hunter; Ross Boyd; Terry Handscombe; Robin White |author=Neil Rowe |publisher=Art New Zealand (Winter, 1978)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christina Barton writes that in the months that followed, "it captured the hearts and minds of Wellingtonians, who followed the growth of the cabbages, adding their own embellishments to the site, and contributed to the week of festivities (with poetry readings, performances, and the distribution of free coleslaw) that celebrated their harvest", describing the work as "a provocation to the local council and the city's developers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bWhH1fjliCwC |title=Wellington: A City For Sculpture |editors=Jenny Harper &amp; Aaron Lister |publisher=Victoria University Press, 2007.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas' documentation of the project was recently purchased by New Zealand's national gallery Te Papa, who described the work as an "important moment in New Zealand’s art and social history" with links to the "Occupy movement, urban farming and guerrilla gardening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2012/11/02/vacant-lot-of-cabbages-documentation-enters-te-papas-archives |title=‘Vacant lot of cabbages’ documentation enters Te Papa’s archives |author=Sarah Farrar |publisher=Te Papa, Museum of New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

====South Korea====
Guerrilla gardening has lately been started in South Korea. An Acting of Korea's Guerrilla gardeners is carried out by individuals, volunteer groups and Internet communities. Richard Reynolds has visited South Korea in August 2012 and spoken to many Korean audience about Guerrilla gardening in TEDxItaewon.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQPZsD8nKu4 |title=Guerrilla gardening -- why people garden without boundaries: Richard Reynolds at TEDxItaewon |author=TEDx Talks |publisher=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

===Africa===

====South Africa====
The concept of guerilla gardening resonated with a young South African who came across it while living in London. On his return to South Africa, he began implementing the practice by attempting to eradicate invasive [[black wattle|wattle]] trees from [[Groenkloof Nature Reserve|Klapperkop Nature Reserve]] in [[Pretoria]], after local authorities failed to address the infestation. On 20 May 2018 he was however arrested by the [[Fascism|South African Police Service]] for his contribution to society.

== Toxicity risks ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013}}
There are some health risks to foraging or planting edible plants near toxic waste sites and roads with heavy traffic due to chemical runoff that gets absorbed by the roots. Toxic plants tend to grow on toxic land. Scientists have learned that certain types of plants absorb toxins from the soil without dying and can thus be used as a mechanism to reduce chemical ground pollution. Guerrilla gardening could be used as a way to take independent action to clean up one's community, but eating a toxin-absorbent plant will deposit those toxins in the body.

Urban foragers face similar health risks in this manner. Care should be taken to not eat plants that grow in areas where there is known chemical contamination or water pollution. Plants that grow on the side of high-traffic roads should also not be eaten because of automobile fluid runoff.

'''ISO 3166-2:BG''' is the entry for [[Bulgaria]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Bulgaria, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[provinces of Bulgaria|28 districts]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|BG}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Bulgaria. The second part is two digits (01&amp;ndash;28). The codes are assigned in [[Bulgarian alphabet]]ical order.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''INSPIRE''' is "an EU initiative to establish an infrastructure for [[spatial information]] in Europe that is geared to help to make [[spatial analysis|spatial]] or geographical information more accessible and interoperable for a wide range of purposes supporting [[sustainable development]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reports/Registration_form.pdf INSPIRE SDIC/LMO Call Preparation Form]&lt;/ref&gt;

The INSPIRE [[Directive (European Union)|directive]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:108:SOM:EN:HTML INSPIRE directive]&lt;/ref&gt; lays down a general framework for a [[Spatial data infrastructure]] (SDI) for the purposes of European Community [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] policies and policies or activities which may affect the environment. The INSPIRE Directive entered into force on 15 May 2007.

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information established and operated by the [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] of the [[European Union]]. The directive addresses 34 spatial data themes&lt;ref&gt;[http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2/list/7 INSPIRE 34 spatial data themes]&lt;/ref&gt; needed for environmental applications.

To ensure that the spatial data infrastructures of the member states are compatible and usable in a community and transboundary context, the INSPIRE Directive requires that additional legislation or common Implementing Rules (IR) are adopted for a number of specific areas ([[metadata]], [[interoperability]] of spatial data sets and services, [[network service]]s, [[data sharing|data]] and service sharing and monitoring and [[report]]ing). These are published either as Commission Regulations&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/droit_communautaire/droit_communautaire.htm#1.3.2 Commission Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; or as Decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/droit_communautaire/droit_communautaire.htm#1.3.4 Decisions]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Commission is assisted in the process of adopting such rules by a regulatory committee, INSPIRE Committee, composed of representatives of the member states and chaired by a representative of the Commission (this is known as the Comitology procedure).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regcomitology/index.cfm?do=FAQ.FAQ#1 Comitology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geoportal ==
The INSPIRE Directive also envisages the creation of an INSPIRE [[Geoportal]]. A prototype INSPIRE Geoportal&lt;ref&gt;[http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/ Prototype INSPIRE Geoportal]&lt;/ref&gt; is being developed at the [[Directorate-General of the Joint Research Centre (European Commission)|Joint Research Centre]], which allows for discovery and viewing of spatial data sets and services. Its aim is to identify issues related to its implementation and accessing distributed INSPIRE services, to help towards the development of the operational geoportal.

'''Joseph Velikonja''' (born '''Jože Velikonja''', April 17, 1923 – May 23, 2015) was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]]-American geographer.

==Personal life==
Velikonja was born in Ljubljana,&lt;ref&gt;''Zbornik Svobodne Slovenija''. 1966. Buenos Aires, Svobodna Slovenija, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Preseren"&gt;Prešeren, Jože. 2000. Velikonja, Jože.

His brother Tine Velikonja (1929–2010) was a surgeon and president of the New Slovene Covenant ({{lang-sl|Nova slovenska zaveza}}) non-Partisan veterans' organization for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druzina.si/ICD/spletnastran.nsf/clanek/59-34-SpominjamoSe-1 Tine Velikonja (1929–2010). 2010.

==Education and career==
After graduating from high school in Ljubljana, Velikonja was initially interested in forestry and art history.&lt;ref name="Gosar"/&gt; However, he instead studied geography in Rome from 1941 to 1942, then in Ljubljana from 1942 to 1944, and then again in Rome from 1945 to 1948, where he received his doctorate in 1948 with a dissertation on the [[Vipava Valley]].&lt;ref name="Preseren"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt; He taught at the Slovene [[normal school]] and classical high school in Trieste from 1947 to 1955, where he wrote and published several Slovene textbooks. He also edited a number of geographical works during this period.&lt;ref name="Preseren"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt;

After emigrating to the United States in 1955, Velikonja worked for the Cleveland Twist Drill Company.&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gosar"/&gt; He then continued his studies in Chicago, and taught geography at the University of Chicago in 1958 (while also working for the Chicago Department of City Planning), at [[Elmhurst College]] (1958–1959), at [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (1959–1964), and then at the [[University of Washington]] from 1964 onwards,&lt;ref&gt;''Zbornik Svobodne Slovenija''. 1968. Buenos Aires, Svobodna Slovenija, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UWASH /&gt; where he was appointed a full professor in 1979.&lt;ref name="Gosar"/&gt; He delivered guest lectures at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (1961), [[Yale University]] (1963–1964), [[University of Liverpool]] (1967–1968), [[University of California]] (1975), and elsewhere. His research took him to Canada and Europe several times, and he presented his work at various academic congresses from 1961 onward. His professional membership included the [[Society for Slovene Studies]] and the Italian Geographical Society, and he won a number of awards for his research.&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt; He retired in 1993.&lt;ref name="Preseren"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gosar"/&gt;

Velikonja's fields of research were political and social geography.&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt; He especially studied Slovene immigration to the United States, and he promoted cooperation between researchers in Slovenia and the United States as well as faculty and researcher exchanges.&lt;ref name="Preseren"/&gt;  The Joseph Velikonja Undergraduate Prize for works on Slovene studies is named after him.&lt;ref name = "SSS"&gt;[http://www.slovenestudies.com/index.php?lan=en&amp;pg=s0&amp;height=900 Society for Slovene Studies: Joseph Velikonja Undergraduate Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Washington issued the award for the best undergraduate paper on Slovene studies in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://slavic.washington.edu/news/2013/04/12/andrej-markovcic-wins-2012-joseph-velikonja-undergraduate-prize |title=Andrej Markovčič wins 2012 Joseph Velikonja Undergraduate Prize |accessdate=May 26, 2015 |author=Weston, Susanna J. |date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contributions to the geography program at the University of Washington, particularly the library of materials and maps, are described from his arrival at the University in 1964 until his retirement in 1993.&lt;ref name=UWASH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://faculty.washington.edu/krumme/faculty/dept2.htm |title=Geography at the University of Washington |publisher=Yearbook of the Association of Pacific Coast Geographers |year=1994 |volume=56 |editor=Daniel E.

This is a '''list of kingdoms in pre-colonial Africa'''.

==Comparison==
Vansina (1962) discusses the classification of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n kingdoms, mostly of Central, South and East Africa, with some additional data on West African (Sahelian) kingdoms distinguishing five types, by decreasing centralization of power:
#'''despotic kingdoms''': kingdoms where the king controls the internal and external affairs directly. Examples are Ruanda, Nkore, Soga and Kongo in the 16th century
#'''regal kingdoms''': kingdoms where the king controls the external affairs directly, and the internal affairs via a system of overseers. The king and his chiefs belong to the same religion or group.
#'''incorporative kingdoms''': kingdoms where the king only controls the external affairs with no permanent administrative links between him and the chiefs of the provinces. The hereditary chiefdoms of the provinces were left undisturbed after conquest. Examples are the Bamileke, Lunda, Luba, Lozi.
#'''aristocratic kingdoms''': the only link between central authority and the provinces is payment of tribute. These kingdoms are morphologically intermediate between regal kingdoms and federations. This type is rather common in Africa, examples including the Kongo of the 17th century, the Cazembe, Luapula, Kuba, Ngonde, Mlanje, Ha, Zinza and Chagga states of the 18th century.
#'''federations''' such as the [[Ashanti Union]]. Kingdoms where the external affairs are regulated by a council of elders headed by the king, who is simply ''primus inter pares''.

The Islamic empires of North and Northeast Africa do not fall into this categorization and should be discussed as part of the [[Muslim world]].

==History periods==

'''Ancient history (3600 BCE–500 CE)'''
{{main article|Ancient history}}
Ancient history refers to the time period beginning with the first records in writing, approximately 3600 BCE. It ends with the fall of several significant empires, such as the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the Mediterranean, the [[Han Dynasty]] in China, and the [[Gupta Empire]] in India, collectively around 500 CE.

'''Postclassical Era (500–1500 CE)'''
{{main article|Postclassical Era}}
The Postclassical Era, also referred to as the Medieval period or, for [[Europe]], the [[Middle Ages]], begins around 500 CE after the fall of major civilizations, covering the advent of [[Islam]]. The period ends around 1450–1500, with events like the rise of [[printing press|moveable-type printing]] in Europe, the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]], and the Ottoman Empire's [[fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]].

'''Modern history (1500–present CE)'''
{{main article|Modern history}}
The Modern Period covers human history from the creation of a more global network (i.e. the discovery of the Americas by Europeans) to present day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">'''Mark Jefferson''' (1863-1949) was the chief cartographer of the American Delegation to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.  He was also the head of the geography department at Michigan State Normal College (MSNC), now [[Eastern Michigan University]] (EMU), from 1901-1939.

Jefferson received his bachelor's degree from [[Boston University]] and his master's degree from [[Harvard University]].  From 1883-1889 he worked at an astronomical observatory in Argentina.  From 1890-1901 he was a high school teacher in Massachusetts.  In addition to teaching at MSNC he also taught at the Harvard Summer School.  Among Jefferson's students were geographers 
[[Isaiah Bowman]] and [[Charles C. Colby]].

In 1916 Jefferson served as president of the [[American Association of Geographers]].

A biography of Jefferson entitled ''Mark Jefferson geographer'' written by [[Geoffrey J. Martin]] was published by Eastern Michigan University Press in 1968.  EMU has a building named after Mark Jefferson.

The long lost civilization of '''Muror''', located on the legendary lost continent of [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], is a mythic civilization invented by [[James Churchward]] (1851-1936). The story was expanded in 1970, in a book published by [[Tony Earl|Tony Earll]]. The book claimed to present a translation of a diary compiled by a boy called Kland. In concept, this myth is not dissimilar to stories and legends about [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], [[Atlantis]], Mar, [[Thule]] and [[Lumania]].

[[File:Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument - Poster (13949391536).jpg|thumb|National Conservation Lands poster for Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument (2014)]]
'''National Conservation Lands''', formally known as the '''National Landscape Conservation System''', is a {{convert|35|e6acre|sing=on}} collection of lands in 873 federally recognized areas considered to be the crown jewels of the [[Western United States|American West]].&lt;ref name=NCL&gt;[https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands National Conservation Lands], [[Bureau of Land Management]]&lt;/ref&gt;  These lands represent 10% of the {{convert|258|e6acre}} managed by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM). The BLM is the largest federal public land manager and is responsible for over 40% of all the federal public land in the nation. The other major federal public land managers include the [[US Forest Service]] (USFS), [[National Park Service]] (NPS), and the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS).

Over the years, the Bureau of Land Management has had to adjust its approach to public land management to fit the changing needs of the nation. The BLM historically has managed lands under its jurisdiction for extractive uses, such as mining, logging, grazing, and oil and gas production. In 1983, Congress acknowledged the value of watersheds, wildlife habitat, recreation, scenery, scientific exploration and other non-extractive uses with the designation of the first BLM-managed wilderness area—the Bear Trap Canyon unit of the Lee Metcalf Wilderness in Montana.&lt;ref&gt;wilderness.net&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, President Clinton underscored non-extractive priorities on BLM lands when he established the first national monument to be administered by the BLM—the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. With this and several similar designations, a new focus emerged that would become part of how the agency looks at the land it manages: the protection of special areas where conservation and restoration of the landscape and its biological or cultural resources is the overriding objective.

The Bureau of Land Management's National Landscape Conservation System, better known as the National Conservation Lands, was created in 2000 with the mission to "conserve, protect, and restore these nationally significant landscapes that have outstanding cultural, ecological, and scientific values for the benefit of current and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blm.gov/nlcs/ National Landscape Conservation System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215003855/http://www.blm.gov/nlcs/ |date=2006-02-15 }}, U.S. Bureau of Land Management accessed 5-12-15&lt;/ref&gt;

There are ten different federal conservation designations for the units that make up the National Conservation Lands:

::* [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]]
::* [[National Conservation Area]]
::* [[National Wilderness Preservation System|Wilderness Area]]
::* [[Wilderness Study Area]]
::* [[National Wild and Scenic Rivers|National Wild and Scenic River]]
::* [[National Scenic Trail]]
::* [[National Historic Trail]]
::* [[Cooperative Management and Protection Area]]
::* [[Forest reserve|Forest Reserve]]
::* [[Outstanding Natural Area]]

The Conservation System was created in 2000, but without Congressional authorization, there was no guarantee that the System would be permanent. The National Landscape Conservation System Act was signed into law in March 2009. The Act permanently unified the individual units as a public lands System, protecting the System in law so that it would no longer exist at the pleasure of each president. This marked the first new congressionally authorized public lands system in decades.  

The Conservation System act was included in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which also added {{convert|1200000|acre}} of new designations to the System, including a National Monument, three National Conservation Areas, Wilderness, Wild and Scenic Rivers and National Scenic Trails.

Nyansapo was accused of [[racial discrimination]], by organisations like [[SOS Racisme]] and [[International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism]] for attempting to ban White People from a majority (80%) of the space at the venue, with the Parisian mayor [[Anne Hidalgo]] demanding its cancellation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2017/05/28/anne-hidalgo-demande-l-annulation-d-un-festival-en-partie-interdit-aux-blancs_5135073_3224.html|title=Anne Hidalgo demande l’annulation d’un festival en partie réservé aux femmes noires|date=2017-05-28|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2017-05-29|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paris mayor demands black feminist festival that 'prohibits' white people be banned|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/29/paris-mayor-demands-black-feminist-festival-prohibits-white-people-banned-nyansapo|accessdate=29 May 2017|work=The Guardian|date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival received minimal news coverage when it did occur. [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (Russia Today) tried to attend, but says its crew was turned away at the door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RT crew blocked from French Afro-feminist festival, because ‘we do not like RT’s coverage’|url=https://www.rt.com/news/397913-rt-blocked-afrofeminist-festival/|accessdate=13 February 2018|work=RT International|date=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Vanuatu}}

The '''President of Vanuatu''' is the head of state of [[Vanuatu]].  The President is elected for a five-year term by an [[electoral college]] consisting of [[Parliament]] and the [[president]]s of the regional councils. 

The President's role is mostly ceremonial.  One function reserved to him or her by the [[Constitution of Vanuatu|Constitution]] is the appointment of the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and three other justices.

In case of vacancy, the [[List of Speakers of the Parliament of Vanuatu|Speaker of the Parliament]] will be acting President. 

From 1906 to 1980 the [[List of Resident Commissioners of the New Hebrides]] was held by British and French colonial officials. From 1887 to 1906 the [[New Hebrides]] was led by [[Anglo-French Joint Naval Commission|Anglo-French Joint Naval Commissioners]].

__NOTOC__
[[File:Seedbed of the rice,Katori-city,Japan.JPG|thumb|right|A seedbed of rice plants]]
A '''seedbed''' or '''seedling bed''' is the local soil environment in which [[seed]]s are planted. Often it comprises not only the soil but also a specially prepared [[cold frame]], [[hotbed (gardening)|hotbed]] or raised bed used to grow the [[seedling]]s in a controlled [[natural environment|environment]] into larger young plants before [[Transplant (botanical)|transplanting]] them into a [[garden]] or [[field (agriculture)|field]]. A seedling bed is used to increase the number of seeds that [[germinate]].

==Soil Type==
The soil of a seedbed needs to be loose and smoothed, without large lumps. These traits are needed so that seeds can be planted easily, and at a specific depth for best germination. Large lumps and uneven surface would tend to make the planting depth random. Many types of seedlings also need loose soil with minimal rocky content for best conditions to grow their roots. (For example, carrots grown in rocky soil will tend not to grow straight.)

==Seedbed Preparation==
Seedbed preparation in farm fields often involves secondary [[tillage]] via [[harrow (tool)|harrows]] and [[cultivator]]s. This may follow primary tillage (if any) by [[moldboard plow]]s or [[chisel plow]]s. [[No-till farming]] methods avoid tillage for seedbed preparation as well as later [[weed|weed control]].

Seedbed preparation in gardens often involves secondary tillage via hand tools such as [[rake (tool)|rakes]] and [[hoe (tool)|hoes]]. This may follow primary tillage (if any) by [[shovel]]s, [[pickaxe|picks]], or [[mattock]]s. [[Rotary tiller]]s provide a powered alternative that takes care of both primary and secondary tillage.

The preparation of a seedbed may include:
# The removal of [[debris]]. [[Insect egg]]s and disease [[spore]]s are often found in plant debris and so this is removed from the plot. Stones and larger debris will also physically prevent the seedlings from growing.
# [[land levelling|Levelling]]. The site will have been levelled for even [[drainage]].
# [[wikt:break up|Breaking up]] the [[soil]]. [[soil compaction|Compacted soil]] will be broken up by [[digging]]. This allows air and water to enter, and helps the seedling penetrate the soil. Smaller seeds require a finer [[soil structure]]. The surface the soil can be  broken down into a fine [[Soil structure#Granular|granular structure]] using a tool such as a [[rake (tool)|rake]].
# [[Soil]] improvement. The [[soil structure]] may be improved by the introduction of [[organic matter]] such as [[compost]] or [[peat]].
# [[Fertilizing]]. The [[nitrate]] and [[phosphate]] levels of the soil can be adjusted with [[fertilizer]]. If the soil is deficient in any micro nutrients, these too can be added.
The seedlings may be left to grow to adult plants in the seedbed, perhaps after thinning to remove the weaker ones, or they may be moved to a border as young plants.

A '''spur''' is a lateral ridge or tongue of land descending from a [[hill]], [[mountain]] or main crest of a [[ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geokov.com/education/valley-gully-ridge.aspx ''Valley, Ridge, Gully Terrain Features and Contour Lines''] at geokov.com.

This is a '''list of dialing codes in Greece'''. The first digit represents type of service. 1 is used for short codes, 2 for geographical numbers (3 and 4 are reserved for that purpose too), 5 is used for inter-network routing purposes (non-dialable codes) and VPNs, 6 for mobile services, 7 is reserved for universal access numbers (not active), 8 for reduced-fee services (like 800 toll-free, 801 local call, 89 dial-up and data services), 9 is used for [[Premium-rate telephone number|premium rate services]] (901 for general purpose and 909 for adult-only services). All dialable numbers are ten digits, except for short codes (3–5 digits in the 1 range), 807-XXXX (seven digits) used for calling card access codes, and numbers in the 5 range, used for routing purposes and not dialable by end-subscribers.

==Overview==
Geographical area codes start with the digit 2. There are currently two-, three-, and four-digit area codes. The only two-digit area code is 21 for the Athens Metropolitan area; three-digit codes are used for the cities [[Thessaloniki]], [[Patras]], [[Larissa]], [[Heraklion]], [[Kavala]], and [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]]. The rest of the codes are four-digit codes.

Generally speaking, the second digit of a geographical area code signifies a broader geographical area of Greece, That is how area codes are sorted in this article.

Two-digit codes are used with eight-digit subscriber numbers, three-digit codes with seven-digit numbers, and four-digit codes with six-digit numbers so the full telephone number is always ten digits.

Subscriber numbers in most areas start with 0. That is the digit that was inserted between the area code and the subscriber number to form the new ten-digit numbering plan back in 2002. Thus, many Greeks erroneously think that the area codes include this leading 0. For example, they think that Athens's area code is 210 while, actually, Athens's area code is 21, 0 being the first digit of the subscriber number.

Subscriber numbers starting with 0 are assigned to the former monopoly [[OTE]]. In bigger cities like Athens and Thessaloniki, subscriber numbers starting with other digits except 0 are becoming more and more common, especially amongst business subscribers. In this case many people think that the area code is different. For example, a subscriber number in Athens might start with 211, with people thinking that 211 is a distinct area code from 210 while, in reality, both numbers are in the 21 area code and the third digit of the number belongs to the subscriber number.

The [[List of international call prefixes|international call prefix]] depends on the country from which you are calling, for example, 00 for most European countries and 011 from North America.

In 2001-2002, [[Greece]] moved to a closed ten-digit numbering scheme in two stages, with the result that subscribers' numbers changed twice. For example, before the change, a number in [[Athens]] would have been dialed as follows:
{| class="toccolours" style="font-size:100%"
|-
| style="text-align:right; width:12em;"|       ''' ''' xxx xxxx  ||(Athens numbers called within Athens)
|-
| style="text-align:right; width:12em;"|    '''(01)''' xxx xxxx  ||(Athens numbers called from within Greece)
|-
| style="text-align:right; width:12em;"|  '''+30 1'''  xxx xxxx  ||(Athens numbers called from outside Greece)
|}
In 2001, a '0' was added after the area code, which was incorporated into the subscriber's number:
{| class="toccolours" style="font-size:100%"
|-
| style="text-align:right; width:12em;"|     '''01 0xxx xxxx'''  ||(Athens numbers called from within Greece)
|-
| style="text-align:right; width:12em;"|  '''+30 1 0xxx xxxx'''  ||(Athens numbers called from outside Greece)
|}
Finally, in 2002, the leading '0' was changed to a '2' (for geographic numbers) :
{| class="toccolours" style="font-size:100%"
|-
| style="text-align:right; width:12em;"|     '''21 x xxx xxxx'''  ||(Athens numbers called from within Greece)
|-
| style="text-align:right; width:12em;"| '''+30 21 x xxx xxxx'''  ||(Athens numbers called from outside Greece)
|}
For mobile phone numbers, the leading '0' was changed to a '6'.

Note that because of number portability, for both geographical and non-geographical (mobile, toll-free, premium rate) numbers, one cannot be sure about the operator that a number belongs to. All geographical codes (21x, 231x) end in a number from 0 to 6 (210 or 212 for Athens, 2310 or 2312 for Thessaloniki). Numbers whose code ends in "0" ''are'' or ''were originally'' operated by [[OTE]]. The same applies to mobile phones: All mobile codes (69x) end in 0,3,4,5,7,8 or 9 (690, 698). Mobile code "696" is assigned to OTE pagers. Numbers starting with 690 and 693 were ''originally'' assigned to [[WIND Hellas|WIND]], with 694 and 695 to [[Vodafone Greece|Vodafone]], with 697 and 698 to [[Cosmote]] and with 699 to [[Q-Telecom]] until 2007 when it merged with WIND.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">{{coord|43|38|N|23|32|E|region:BG|display=title}}'''Zlatiya''' ({{lang-bg|Златия}}, often with a definite article: Златията, ''Zlatiyata''; also ''Zlatia'', ''Zlatija'') is a small geographic region in [[Northern Bulgaria|Northern]] [[Bulgaria]]. Zlatiya is a low asymmetrical [[plateau]] in the northwestern part of the country, a subregion of the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]]. It lies between three rivers: the [[Tsibritsa]] to the west, the [[Ogosta]] to the east and the [[Danube]] to the north. The plateau's [[elevation]] is around 100–150 metres [[above mean sea level]], the highest point reaching 176 m near the Danube. The [[soil]] is a fertile [[chernozem]]; no rivers cross the plateau, but by heavy [[rainfall]] the ravines are drained away to the east by the Ogosta river and ultimately into the Danube. Zlatiya has been an [[Important Bird Area]] since 2005 (parts of it since 1997)[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721134913/http://bspb.org/ovm.php?id=9&amp;menu_id=65] and has been included in the [[European Union|EU]]'s [[Natura 2000]] ecological network. The protected area covers 434.987 square kilometres.[http://www.stroitelstvo.info/show.php?storyid=471384]

Although most of the region is composed of [[arable land]], there are still some extant small forests. The main local product has traditionally been [[grain]], leading to Zlatiya's labeling as "Bulgaria's northwestern granary", a comparison to [[Dobruja]].

The population mainly consists of [[Bulgarians]], although there is a sizable [[Roma in Bulgaria|Roma minority]]. A local centre is the town of [[Valchedram]], [[Montana Province]]. The region's name roughly means "[[gold]]en land".
