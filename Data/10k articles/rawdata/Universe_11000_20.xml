The '''1966 Soviet submarine global circumnavigation''' was announced to be the first submerged around-the-world voyage by a group of Soviet nuclear-powered submarines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Chronology of the three centuries of the Russian Fleet: Introduction | url= http://rusnavy.com/history/kron.htm | work= History | publisher= Russian Navy | date= 1998–2010 | accessdate=2010-04-07 |quote=1966.

Moore |date= 2004 |publisher= Potomac Books |location= Washington, DC |isbn= 1-57488-530-8 |page= 78 |quote=Hereafter referred to as Polmar and Moore.  ''Cold War Submarines'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The voyage was an early example of [[blue-water navy|blue-water]] operations by the [[Soviet Navy|Soviet Navy's]] nuclear-powered submarine fleet, and it paved the way for future operations during the latter half of the [[Cold War]].  The voyage took place nearly six years after the [[Operation Sandblast|first complete submerged circumnavigation of the world]] undertaken by the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered submarine {{USS|Triton|SSRN-586|2}} in 1960.

Technically speaking, this Soviet submerged around-the-world voyage was not a true "circumnavigation" since the submarine group went from the Soviet Northern Fleet in the area of the [[Kola Peninsula]] to the Soviet Pacific Fleet base in [[Kamchatka]] going around South America and consequently did not go completely around the world as did the USS ''Triton''.

==Background==
The development of nuclear-powered submarines by the Soviet Navy differed significantly from the approach adopted by the United States Navy.  While first generation U.S. Navy nuclear submarines were experimental vessels that could carry out operational missions, the Soviet Navy opted for immediate series production for its [[Hotel class submarine|Hotel]], [[Echo class submarine|Echo]], and [[November class submarine|November]] classes (NATO names), which were known collectively as the HEN classes.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore.  ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 76–78, 82, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;  While more capable in many respects than early U.S. nuclear submarines, early Soviet nuclear submarines also experienced [[Soviet submarine K-19|significant problems with their reactor plants]], and remedial action was required to correct these technical deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore.  ''Cold War Submarines''. pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the Soviet Navy could not deploy any nuclear-powered submarines in support of [[Operation Anadyr]], the Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missile build-up in Cuba which caused the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962.&lt;ref name=Polmar79&gt;Polmar and Moore.  ''Cold War Submarines''. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational summary==
The first submerged circumnavigation by a detachment (Russian: отряд; ''otryad'') of submarines was undertaken by two submarines under the overall command of Rear Admiral Anatoly Ivanovich Sorokin.  The detachment departed from the [[Soviet Northern Fleet|Red Banner Northern Fleet]] on 1 February 1966.&lt;ref name=Chepurov&gt;{{cite web | last= Chepurov | first= A.M. | title= Underwater navigation round the World | url= http://rusnavy.com/history/si54.htm | date= 1999 | work= History | publisher= Official Russian Navy Website | accessdate=2010-02-24 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100217005128/http://rusnavy.com/history/si54.htm| archivedate= 17 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Filimoshin&gt;{{cite web |first= M.V. |last= Filimoshin |title= Account of 1966 Submarine Circumnavigation of Glode |url= http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA359706&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf | format=PDF |work= USSR Report: Military History Journal  |publisher= [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] |location= [[Washington, DC]] |pages= 57–60 |language= Russian|id= JPRS-UMA-86-046 |date=February 1986 |accessdate= 2010-03-23 |quote= originally published in ''Military History Journal'' No. 2, February 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PolmarNoot&gt;{{cite book |title= Submarines of the Russian and Soviet Navies, 1718-1990  |authorlink=Norman Polmar|last= Polmar |first= Norman |author2= Jurrien Noot |date= 1993 |publisher= [[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location= [[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn= 0-87021-570-1 |page= 175 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7cDN8q2RHGMC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=Polmar+Sorokin+%22Submarines+of+the+Russian+and+Soviet+Navies,+1718-1990++22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TFQ6SUEqv6&amp;sig=5ELJei6YsUKUHm_ZSpts1kl1e3E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FF6WS9L8IIjh8Qa7uck7&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Planning for the mission was credited to Admiral [[Vladimir Chernavin]], the future Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy.&lt;ref name=Studenikin&gt;{{cite web |first= Lt.

[[File:November class SSN 627 project.svg|thumb|right|Project 627 (November class) submarine|alt=Graphic depicting a submarine with a rounded bow, cylindrical hull that tapes to a fin-like rudder, a conning tower near the bow that tapes backward and has nine radio masts and periscopes, and two propeller shafts near its stern.]]

The detachment consisted of the [[November-class submarine|Project 627 (November class) attack submarine]] [[November-class submarine#K-133|''K-133'']] under the command of [[Frigate Captain|Captain 2nd Rank]] V.T. Vinogradov and the [[Echo-class submarine|Project 675 (Echo II class) cruise missile submarine]] [[Soviet submarine K-116|''K-116'']] under the command of Captain 2nd Rank L.N.

The detachment crossed the [[Barents Sea]], the [[Norwegian Sea]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and the [[Pacific Ocean]] via the [[Drake Passage]] which, according to [[Doktor nauk|Academian]] A.M. Chepurov, was the most dangerous phase of the voyage.&lt;ref name=Chepurov/&gt;&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt; Concerns included [[icebergs]] and collisions with [[Killer whales|whales]].&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt; The ships' personnel participated in [[Line-crossing ceremony|line-crossing ceremonies]] when the detachment crossed the [[Equator]].&lt;ref name=Chepurov/&gt;&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt;  They also celebrated the landing of the Soviet space probe [[Venera 3]] on the surface of the planet [[Venus]].&lt;ref name=Studenikin/&gt;  The detachment completed its circumnavigation by arriving at the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]] submarine base in [[Vilyuchinsk]] on 26 March 1966, having covered {{convert|21,000|nmi|km mi|abbr=on}} in 52 days.&lt;ref name=Chepurov/&gt;&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt; The detachment reportedly encountered numerous U.S. naval vessels during its around the world voyage, but successfully avoided detection.&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The circumnavigation served an immediate political purpose because the mission was dedicated to the [[23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt;  The voyage provided a showcase for the capabilities of the Soviet Navy's nuclear submarine fleet as well as the professionalism of its personnel.&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt;  Approximately one-third of the detachment personnel were members of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]],  and the rest were [[Komsomol]] members.&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt; Scientific studies were carried out during the voyage.&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt; Shipboard systems, tactical coordination, communications, and training were also carried out under a variety of climatic conditions.&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt;  The timing of circumnavigation's completion coincided with discussions regarding the upcoming Five-Year Defense Plan.&lt;ref name=PolmarNoot/&gt;  Minister of Defense [[Rodion Malinovsky]] addressed the 23rd Congress on 2 April 1966:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In recent years, the number of long cruises by our nuclear submarines have increased by 5-fold and they have clearly demonstrated the capability of our glorious sailors to successfully carry out any mission in the ocean expanses from the Arctic to Antarctic.  Several days ago an around-the-world cruise by a group of nuclear submarines traveling submerged was successfully concluded.&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The announcement was reportedly "greeted with stormy applause."&lt;ref name=PolmarNoot/&gt;  Admiral Sorokin was awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] from [[Nikolai Podgorny]], the [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]].&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt;  ''K-133'' commander Vinogradov, chief engineer S.P. Samsonov, and three other participants were awarded the titles of Heroes of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Chepurov/&gt;&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt;  ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the voyage in the following [[UPI]] dispatch dated 8 April 1966:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A squadron of nuclear-powered Soviet missile submarines kept a close watch on American planes and ships encountered during a recent around-the-world voyage, [[Krasnaya Zvezda]] said today.  An officer who made the six-week tour as a special correspondent reported in the Defense Ministry newspaper that American planes and ships were detected several times. "Every time the necessary measures were taken on board the atomic submarines," he said.  On one occasion, when his submarine rose to periscope depth, he said, a United States plane was sighted and "we dived lower so as not to whet the appetites of the antisubmarine forces of the imperialists." "Of course, we had nothing to be afraid of," he added.  "We crossed the seas and oceans strictly observing the international rules of navigation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Soviet Nuclear Submarines Circle World in Six Weeks |url = http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10B13F6355D15768FDDA00894DC405B868AF1D3 |format = PDF |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |page = 7 |date = April 9, 1966 |agency = [[United Press International]]| accessdate= 8 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}} (fee required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The unnamed naval officer cited in the above article was undoubtedly Captain 2nd Rank G.A. Savichek.&lt;ref name=Filimoshin/&gt;

==Legacy==
While this submerged circumnavigation by a group of submarines received little notice outside of Soviet naval circles,&lt;ref name=PolmarNoot/&gt; Soviet nuclear submarine operations took on an increasingly blue-water orientation.  In 1968, a November-class submarine successfully tracked a carrier task group led by the nuclear aircraft carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|2}} much to the surprise of [[Office of Naval Intelligence|U.S. naval intelligence]].&lt;ref name=Polmar79/&gt;  Also, the Soviet Navy deployed its first true nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, the [[Yankee class submarine|Yankee class]], which began its first nuclear deterrence patrol in June 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines''. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Yankee class SSBN.svg|thumb|right|Project 667A (Yankee class) submarine]]
A detachment of two nuclear submarines, one of them a ballistic missile submarine, subsequently undertook a second around-the-world voyage, departing from the [[Barents Sea]] on January 5, 1976, and following a route similar to the one taken in 1966.  The detachment commander, [[Captain (naval)|Captain 1st Rank]] Valentin Y. Sokolov, was personally selected by [[Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union|Admiral]] [[Sergey Gorshkov]], the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy, to command this detachment.  This strategic deterrence patrol included operations in the North Atlantic.  During its transit of the South Pacific, the detachment discovered a previously unknown ocean current.  The detachment transferred to the Kamchatka Flotilla of the Soviet Pacific Fleet after 70 days at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Oleg |last= Karmaza |title= 1976 SSBN Deployment Along U.S. Coast Recalled |url= http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA334720&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf | format=PDF |work= Central Eurasia: Military Affairs |publisher= [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] |location= [[Washington, DC]] |pages= 32–35 |language= Russian|id= JPRS-UMA-92-012 |date= April 8, 1992 |accessdate= 2010-04-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Soviet Navy itself, its blue-water aspirations culminated in &lt;small&gt;OKEAN&lt;/small&gt;, a 1970 worldwide naval exercise.  This feat was replicated with &lt;small&gt;OKEAN 75&lt;/small&gt;, a three-week follow-up held in April–May 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Soviet Union: All the Ships at Sea | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913027,00.html | work= [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] | publisher= [[Time Inc.]] | date= May 5, 1975 | accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet Defense Minister [[Andrey Grechko]] declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Okean'' maneuvers were evidence of the increased naval might of our socialist state, an index of the fact our Navy has become so great and strong that it is capable of executing mission in defense of our state interests over the broad expanses of the World Oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Naval Institute Guide to the Soviet Navy |authorlink=Norman Polmar|last= Polmar |first= Norman |date= 1991 |publisher= [[U.S. Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location= [[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn= 0-87021-241-9 |page= 41 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tkGDkpkQh-sC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Okean+%22Soviet+Navy%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ftJdu-nslJ&amp;sig=RA3hvK8O7h4_8MD_oFOv_3R4mDw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4PStS-vIN4P98Abl-vyiDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Okean%20%22Soviet%20Navy%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The impact of this Soviet naval expansion was summarized by [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]]  [[Peter Hill-Norton, Baron Hill-Norton|Sir Peter Hill-Norton, RN]], the chairman of [[NATO]]{{'}}s military staff committee, who observed: "The U.S. had never previously faced a global threat to its sea-lane communications from a mix of subsurface, surface and maritime-air naval forces. This is a strategic change of kind, not of degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The Navy Under Attack | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919594-8,00.html | work= [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] | date= May 8, 1978 | accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2010 Vladikavkaz bombing''' took place at the Central market in [[Vladikavkaz]], [[North Ossetia–Alania]], [[Russia]] on 9 September 2010 when a suicide car bomber detonated his explosives killing at least 17 and injuring more than 160.

==Background==
The Central market has been a target of terrorist attacks twice: in 1999, when car explosion killed 52 people, and in 2008, when a female suicide bomber detonated bombs attached to herself at the bus stop near the market, claiming lives of 12 people and injuring 41.

==Attack==
A second bomb discovered in a car near the site of the first explosion was successfully defused.

==Investigation==
The remains of the suicide attacker's decapitated corpse were discovered. Russia's president, [[Dmitry Medvedev]], condemned the attack as "monstrous". The prime minister, [[Vladimir Putin]], said the attack was designed to "sow enmity between our citizens". He called on Russia's substantial Muslim population to make a "decisive contribution" in the fight against extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/09/russian-market-deadly-car-bomb|title = Islamist militants blamed after suicide bomb kills 16 in Christian Caucasus city|last = Harding|first = Luke|date = 2010-09-09|newspaper = The Guardian|language = en-GB|issn = 0261-3077|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{One source|date=September 2010}}

== Casualties ==
At least 4 ethnic [[Armenians]], including 1 [[Armenia]]n citizen, were among the dead. Armenians were also among the injured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2153353.html Four Armenians Among Russia Blast Victims ] RFEL, September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3081">The '''barrel of oil equivalent''' ('''BOE''') is a [[units of energy|unit of energy]] based on the approximate energy released by burning one [[Barrel (unit)|barrel]] (42 U.S. gallons or 158.9873 litres) of [[crude oil]].  The BOE is used by oil and gas companies in their financial statements as a way of combining [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] reserves and production into a single measure, although this energy equivalence does not take into account the lower financial value of energy in the form of gas.

The U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] defines a BOE as equal to 5.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[BTU]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-99-18.pdf IRS publication]&lt;/ref&gt; (5.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[BTU|BTU&lt;sub&gt;59 °F&lt;/sub&gt;]] equals 6.1178632 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule|J]], about 6.1 GJ ([[Higher heating value|HHV]]), or {{Convert|1|BOE|MWh|disp=output only|lk=out}}.)  The value is necessarily approximate as various grades of oil and gas have slightly different heating values. If one considers the [[lower heating value]] instead of the [[higher heating value]], the value for one BOE would be approximately 5.4 GJ (see [[ton of oil equivalent]]). Typically {{Convert|1|BOE|cuftnaturalgas|disp=output only|lk=out}} or 58 [[Therm|CCF]] are equivalent to one BOE. The [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] gives a figure of 6,000 cubic feet (170 cubic meters) of typical natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.cr.usgs.gov/WEcont/world/woutsum.pdf Table AR-1 USGS World Petroleum Assessment 2000, Description and results, USGS World Energy Assessment team]&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly used multiple of the BOE is the [[metric system|kilo]] barrel of oil equivalent (kboe or kBOE), which is 1,000BOE. Other common multiples are the million barrels per day, MMboed (or MMBOED, MMboepd), used to measure daily production and consumption,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010820165259/http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/Infocardnew.html Energy Infocard] retrieved 16 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the BBOe (also BBOE) or billion barrel of oil equivalent, representing 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; barrels of oil, used to measure petroleum reserves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds-060/ESpt1.html USGS World Petroleum Assessment] retrieved 16 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Metric users may talk of the [[tonne of oil equivalent]] (TOE), or more often million TOE (MTOE). Since this is a measurement of weight, any conversion to barrels of oil equivalent depends on the density of the oil in question, as well as the energy content. Typically 1 tonne of oil has a volume of 6.8-7.5 barrels. The United States EIA suggests 1TOE has an average energy value of 39.68 million BTU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/archive/aeo01/pdf/apph.pdf Conversion Factors] retrieved 16 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A Central Forest Reserve is a body of forest or woodland managed by the [[National Forestry Authority]] (NFA) under the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act 8/2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nema-ug.org/regulations/forestry_tree_planting_act.pdf Uganda National Forestry Tree Planting Act 8/2003]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFA is mandated to manage all 506 Central Forest Reserves in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfa.org.ug |title=National Forestry Authority |publisher=Nfa.org.ug |date=2011-11-08 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reserves are part of the [[List of Protected Areas in Uganda|protected areas of Uganda]]. The total area of land covered is 12,657.47&amp;nbsp;km² or 6.3% of the total land area of [[Uganda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfa.org.ug/docs/forests_functions_and_classification.pdf "Forests Functions and Classification," National Forest Augthority of Uganda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906023450/http://nfa.org.ug/docs/forests_functions_and_classification.pdf |date=2012-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They compose of natural forest like [[Albertine Rift montane forests|moist semi-deciduous forests]] and forest plantations mainly of [[pine]] and [[eucalyptus]] species. Legal activities done under the NFA are [[Forestry in Uganda|harvesting timber]], re-planting and tourism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24332">'''Clathrate hydrates''', or '''gas clathrates''', '''gas hydrates''', '''clathrates''', '''hydrates''', etc., are [[crystal]]line water-based [[solid]]s physically resembling [[ice]], in which small [[Chemical polarity|non-polar]] [[molecule]]s (typically [[gas]]es) or [[Chemical polarity|polar]] molecules with large hydrophobic [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] are trapped inside "cages" of [[hydrogen bond]]ed, frozen [[water (molecule)|water molecules]].  In other words, clathrate hydrates are [[clathrate compound]]s in which the host molecule is [[water]] and the guest molecule is typically a gas or liquid.  Without the support of the trapped molecules, the [[Crystal structure|lattice]] structure of hydrate clathrates would collapse into conventional ice crystal structure or liquid water. Most low molecular weight gases, including {{oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, {{hydrogen}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, {{nitrogen}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[methane|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]], {{argon}}, {{krypton}}, and {{xenon}}, as well as some higher [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[freon]]s, will form [[hydrate]]s at suitable temperatures and pressures. Clathrate hydrates are not officially chemical compounds, as the sequestered molecules are never bonded to the lattice. The formation and decomposition of clathrate hydrates are [[Phase transition#Classification of phase transitions|first order phase transitions]], not chemical reactions. Their detailed formation and decomposition mechanisms on a molecular level are still not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gao S |author2=House W|author3=Chapman WG | year = 2005 | title = NMR MRI Study of Gas Hydrate Mechanisms | volume = 109 | pages = 19090–19093 | publisher   = American Chemical Society | doi = 10.1021/jp052071w | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/9701479/NMR-MRI-Study-of-Gas-Hydrate-Mechanisms | accessdate = August 3, 2009 | pmid = 16853461 | issue = 41 | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gao S |author2=Chapman WG|author3=House W | year = 2005 | title = NMR and Viscosity Investigation of Clathrate Formation and Dissociation | journal = Ind.

Clathrate hydrates were first documented in 1810 by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] who found that water was a primary component of what was earlier thought to be solidified chlorine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUwNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=On Hydrate of Chlorine |accessdate=20 March 2014 |date=November 2004 |author=Michael Faraday |publisher=Quarterly Journal of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ethomas.web.wesleyan.edu/ees123/clathrate.htm |title=Clathrates: little known components of the global carbon cycle |accessdate=13 December 2007 |date=November 2004 |author=Ellen Thomas |publisher=Wesleyan University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clathrates have been found to occur naturally in large quantities. Around 6.4 trillion (6.4×10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) tonnes of [[methane]] is trapped in deposits of [[methane clathrate]] on the deep [[ocean floor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = B. | last = Buffett | first2 = D. | last2 = Archer | title = Global inventory of methane clathrate: sensitivity to changes in the deep ocean | year = 2004 | pages = 185–199 | journal = Earth Planet.

Clathrates can also exist as [[permafrost]], as at the [[Mallik gas hydrate site]] in the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] of northwestern [[Canadian Arctic]]. These natural gas hydrates are seen as a potentially vast energy resource, but an economical extraction method has so far proven elusive. Hydrocarbon clathrates cause problems for the petroleum industry, because they can form inside [[Pipeline transport|gas pipelines]], often resulting in obstructions. Deep sea deposition of [[carbon dioxide clathrate]] has been proposed as a method to remove this [[greenhouse gas]] from the atmosphere and control [[climate change]].

Clathrates are suspected to occur in large quantities on some outer [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]] and [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, binding gas at fairly high temperatures.

== Structure ==

[[Image:HydrateStructures.jpg|thumb|200px|Cages building the different gas hydrate structures.]]

Gas hydrates usually form two [[Crystallography|crystallographic]] cubic structures: structure (Type) I (named ''sI'') and structure (Type) II (named ''sII'')&lt;ref&gt;von Stackelberg, M. &amp; Müller, H. M. (1954) ''Zeitschrift für Elektrochemie'' '''58''', 1, 16, 83&lt;/ref&gt; of space groups &lt;math&gt;Pm\overline{3}n&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;Fd\overline{3}m&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Seldom, a third hexagonal structure of space group &lt;math&gt;P6/mmm&lt;/math&gt; may be observed (Type H).&lt;ref&gt;Sloan E. D., Jr. (1998) Clathrate hydrates of natural gases. Second edition, Marcel Dekker Inc.:New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit cell of Type I consists of 46 water molecules, forming two types of cages – small and large. The unit cell contains two small cages and six large ones. The small cage has the shape of a pentagonal [[dodecahedron]] (5&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) (which is not a regular dodecahedron) and the large one that of a [[tetradecahedron]], specifically a [[hexagonal truncated trapezohedron]] (5&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  Together, they form a version of the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]]. Typical guests forming Type I hydrates are [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in [[carbon dioxide clathrate]] and [[methane|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] in [[methane clathrate]].

The unit cell of Type II consists of 136 water molecules, again forming two types of cages – small and large. In this case there are sixteen small cages and eight large ones in the unit cell.  The small cage again has the shape of a pentagonal dodecahedron (5&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;), but the large one is a [[hexadecahedron]] (5&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;6&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;). Type II hydrates are formed by gases like O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The unit cell of Type H consists of 34 water molecules, forming three types of cages – two small ones of different types, and one "huge". In this case, the unit cell consists of three small cages of type 5&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, two small ones of type 4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;5&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;6&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and one huge of type 5&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;6&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. The formation of Type H requires the cooperation of two guest gases (large and small) to be stable. It is the large cavity that allows structure H hydrates to fit in large molecules (e.g. [[butane]], [[hydrocarbon]]s), given the presence of other smaller help gases to fill and support the remaining cavities. Structure H hydrates were suggested to exist in the Gulf of Mexico. Thermogenically-produced supplies of heavy hydrocarbons are common there.

Kieffer ''et al.''

[[Carbon dioxide clathrate]] is believed to play a major role in different processes on Mars.  [[Hydrogen clathrate]] is likely to form in condensation nebulae for gas giants.

== Hydrates on Earth==

===Natural gas hydrates===
{{main|Methane clathrate}}
Naturally on [[Earth]] gas hydrates can be found on the [[seabed]], in ocean sediments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1980 |author1=Kvenvolden, K. A. |author2=McMenamin, M. A. |title=Hydrates of Natural Gas: Their Geologic Occurrence |journal=U. S. Geological Survey Circular |volume=825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in deep lake sediments (e.g. [[Lake Baikal]]), as well as in the [[permafrost]] regions. The amount of [[methane]] potentially trapped in natural [[Methane clathrate|methane hydrate]] deposits may be significant (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; cubic metres),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16848-ice-that-burns-could-be-a-green-fossil-fuel|title=Ice that burns could be a green fossil fuel|last=Marshall|first=Michael|date=March 26, 2009|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes them of major interest as a potential energy resource. Catastrophic release of methane from the decomposition of such deposits may lead to a global climate change, because [[methane|CH]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is more of an efficient greenhouse gas than [[carbon dioxide|CO]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (see [[Atmospheric methane]]). The fast decomposition of such deposits is considered a [[geohazard]], due to its potential to trigger [[landslide]]s, [[earthquake]]s  and [[tsunami]]s. However, natural gas hydrates do not contain only methane but also other [[hydrocarbon]] gases, as well as [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. [[Air hydrates]] are frequently observed in polar ice samples.

[[Pingo]]s are common structures in permafrost regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Methane Leakage from Pingo-like Features on the Arctic Shelf, Beaufort Sea, NWT, Canada  | publisher = SAO/NASA ADS  |date=December 2005 | bibcode = 2005AGUFM.C11A1069U | author1 = Ussler, W. | author2 = Paull, C. K. | author3 = Lorenson, T. | author4 = Dallimore, S. | author5 = Medioli, B. | author6 = Blasco, S. | author7 = McLaughlin, F. | author8 = Nixon, F. M. | volume = 11 | pages = 1069 | journal = American Geophysical Union }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar structures are found in deep water related to methane leakages. Significantly, gas hydrates can even be formed in the absence of a liquid phase. Under that situation, water is dissolved in gas or in liquid hydrocarbon phase.&lt;ref&gt;Youssef, Z.; Barreau, A., Mougin, P., Jose, J.; Mokbel, I. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2009, 48, 4045–4050&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, both Japan and China announced that attempts at large-scale [[resource extraction]] of methane hydrates from under the seafloor were successful.  However, commercial-scale production remains years away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/china-japan-extracts-combustible-ice-from-seafloor-a-step-towards-harnessing-a-legendary-frozen-fossil-fuel http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/china-japan-extracts-combustible-ice-from-seafloor-a-step-towards-harnessing-a-legendary-frozen-fossil-fuel]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas hydrates in pipelines===
Thermodynamic conditions favouring hydrate formation are often found in [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]]. This is highly undesirable, because the clathrate crystals might agglomerate and plug the line&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ef800189k | title = Investigation of Interactions between Gas Hydrates and Several Other Flow Assurance Elements | year = 2008 | last1 = Gao | first1 = Shuqiang | journal = Energy &amp; Fuels | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 3150–3153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and cause [[flow assurance]] failure and damage valves and instrumentation. The results can range from flow reduction to equipment damage.

====Hydrate formation, prevention and mitigation philosophy====
Hydrates have a strong tendency to [[agglomerate]] and to adhere to the pipe wall and thereby plug the pipeline. Once formed, they can be decomposed by increasing the temperature and/or decreasing the pressure. Even under these conditions, the clathrate dissociation is a slow process.

Therefore, preventing hydrate formation appears to be the key to the problem. A hydrate prevention philosophy could typically be based on three levels of security, listed in order of priority:
# Avoid operational conditions that might cause formation of hydrates by depressing the hydrate formation temperature using [[glycol dehydration]];
# Temporarily change [[operating conditions]] in order to avoid hydrate formation;
# Prevent formation of hydrates by addition of chemicals that (a) shift the hydrate equilibrium conditions towards lower temperatures and higher pressures or (b) increase hydrate formation time ([[Reaction inhibitor|inhibitor]]s)

The actual philosophy would depend on operational circumstances such as pressure, temperature, type of flow (gas, liquid, presences of water etc.)

====Hydrate inhibitors====
When operating within a set of parameters where hydrates could be formed, there are still ways to avoid their formation. Altering the gas composition by adding chemicals can lower the hydrate formation temperature and/or delay their formation. Two options generally exist:
* Thermodynamic inhibitors
* [[Kinetic Inhibitor|Kinetic inhibitors/anti-agglomerants]]

The most common thermodynamic inhibitors are [[methanol]], [[ethylene glycol|monoethylene glycol]] (MEG), and [[diethylene glycol]] (DEG), commonly referred to as [[glycol]]. All may be recovered and recirculated, but the economics of methanol recovery is not favourable in most cases. MEG is preferred over DEG for applications where the temperature is expected to be &amp;minus;10&amp;nbsp;°C or lower due to high viscosity at low temperatures. [[Triethylene glycol]] (TEG) has too low vapour pressure to be suited as an inhibitor injected into a gas stream. More methanol is lost in the gas phase when compared to MEG or DEG.

The use of [[Kinetic Inhibitor|kinetic inhibitors]] and anti-agglomerants in actual field operations is a new and evolving technology. It requires extensive tests and optimisation to the actual system. While kinetic inhibitors work by slowing down the kinetics of the nucleation, anti-agglomerants do not stop the nucleation, but stop the agglomeration (sticking together) of gas hydrate crystals.  These two kinds of inhibitors are also known as [[LDHI|low dosage hydrate inhibitors]], because they require much smaller concentrations than the conventional thermodynamic inhibitors.  Kinetic inhibitors, which do not require water and hydrocarbon mixture to be effective, are usually polymers or copolymers and anti-agglomerants (requires water and hydrocarbon mixture) are polymers or [[zwitterion]]ic&amp;nbsp;— usually ammonium and COOH&amp;nbsp;— surfactants being both attracted to hydrates and hydrocarbons.

[[File:Cross Slip.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The screw part of a dislocation loop can move to another slip plane which is called cross slip plane. In this Figure the dislocation Burgers vector  is along the intersection of the planes.]]
'''Cross slip''' is the process when a screw [[dislocation]] moves from one slip plane to another. As this kind of dislocation (Unlike edge and mixed dislocations) doesn't have a unique glide plane, a pure screw segment is free to move from one slip plane to another if it contains the direction of [[burgers vector]]. In face centered cubic metals dislocation can move from one {111} type plane to another and In body centered [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] metals as the slip plane is less well defined, a dislocation with b=0.5&lt;{{overline|1}}11&gt; can glide on {110} planes or {211} planes. The cross slip of moving dislocations can easily be seen by [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEMs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/706802874|title=Introduction to dislocations|last=Derek.|first=Hull,|date=2011|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|others=Bacon, D.

'''Devoré''' (also called '''burnout''') is a fabric technique particularly used on [[velvet]]s, where a mixed-fibre material undergoes a chemical process to dissolve the [[cellulose fiber]]s to create a semi-transparent pattern against more solidly woven fabric. The same technique can also be applied to textiles other than velvet, such as lace or the fabrics in burnout [[t-shirt]]s.&lt;ref name=margo/&gt;

Devoré comes from the French verb ''dévorer'', meaning literally to devour.&lt;ref name="TA Swift"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swift|first1=Dionne|title=Exploring Devoré...|url=http://www.textilearts.net/tutors/dionneswift/devore.php|website=textilearts.net|publisher=Textile Arts|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1980s  Fogg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fogg|first1=Marnie|title=1980s Fashion Print|date=2009|publisher=Anova Books (Batsford)|location=London|isbn=978 19063 8841 6|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Burnout fabrics are thought to have originated in France, possibly as a cheap alternative to lace that could be created using caustic paste on fabric.&lt;ref name="TA Swift"/&gt; The commercial chemical process used in fashion garments was developed in [[Lyon]] at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Indie Hume"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hume|first1=Marian|title=Fashion: Mr Contran's fin de siecle: Severity, thy name was Jasper: Now he who cleaved to chaste lines and plain black has taken to more exotic stuff.

The technique was popularised in the 1920s – typically used on evening gowns and shawls – and revived in the 1980s and '90s, notably by [[Jasper Conran]] on theatrical costumes and then evening wear and by [[Georgina von Etzdorf]] on scarves.&lt;ref name="TA Swift"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herald Brennan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brennan|first1=Mary|title=All hands to tutu|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/all-hands-to-tutu-1.716316|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=[[Herald Scotland]]|date=10 March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent Roffey"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roffey|first1=Monique|title=In thing: Georgina von Etzdorf scarves|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/in-thing-georgina-von-etzdorf-scarves-1412305.html|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=The Independent|date=8 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgina von Etzdorf: 25 years of sensuous textiles|url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/whats-on/exhibitions/index.php?itemID=14|website=manchestergalleries.org|publisher=Manchester Art Gallery|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s revival===
Conran is credited with popularising devoré, introducing it in 1989 and taking the technique forward in the 1990s in his main fashion line.&lt;ref name="Indie Hume"/&gt; He refined his techniques on theatrical costumes; in the 1992 production of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' directed by [[Simon Callow]], burnout fabrics were heavily used for the costumes of [[Eliza Doolittle]] and street vendors.&lt;ref name="Indie Hume"/&gt; Conran's devoré technique also featured in [[David Bintley]]'s 1993 [[Royal Ballet]] production of ''Tombeaux'', where it was used to create the two-tone velvet tutu worn by [[Darcey Bussell]] and the [[corps de ballet]] costumes.&lt;ref name="Indie Hume"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Birmingham Bintley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bintley|first1=David|title=Recapturing a Dream: David Bintley on Tombeaux|url=http://www.brb.org.uk/tombeaux-2013.html|publisher=Birmingham Royal Ballet|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, it featured in the [[Scottish Ballet]] production of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', where Conran said it produced better results for lower cost than [[appliqué]] techniques.&lt;ref name="TA Swift"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herald Brennan"/&gt;

Conran's most elaborate devoré fashion pieces – which were oven baked as part of the process – were time-consuming to produce and expensive to buy; in 1993, a panelled evening skirt retailed at £572 and an acid-treated shirt cost £625.&lt;ref name="Indie Hume"/&gt;

Established as a [[Wiltshire]] textile printing workshop in 1981, Georgina von Etzdorf's primary focus was on creating painterly effects on fabric. Credited with popularising the velvet scarf, she introduced devoré to the range in 1993 – having experimented with printed velvets from 1985.&lt;ref name="Pattern Design Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Lesley|title=Twentieth Century Pattern Design|date=8 February 2007|publisher=[[Princeton Architectural Press]]|isbn=978-1568987125|pages=209–11|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c93jEZwcfPoC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=Georgina+von+Etzdorf#v=onepage&amp;q=Georgina%20von%20Etzdorf&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
Devoré techniques use blended fabrics which combine protein-based fibres such as [[silk]] with cellulose-based fibres such as [[viscose]], [[cotton]], or [[rayon]]. In order to create the 'burnout' pattern, a chemical gel containing [[sodium hydrogen sulphate]] is applied to the fabric in patterns, dissolving away the cellulose-based fibres and leaving behind the protein-based fibres, which are not affected by the chemical. The chemical gel may be applied either by printing or by hand painting on the fabric.&lt;ref name=margo&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Margo|title=Textile Surface Decoration: Silk and Velvet|year=2007|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|isbn=9780812220001|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5304">In [[particle physics]], the hypothetical '''dilaton''' particle, and scalar field, appears in theories with [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)#Additional dimensions|extra dimensions]] when the volume of the compactified dimensions varies.  It appears as a [[radion (physics)|radion]] in [[Kaluza–Klein theory]]'s [[compactification (physics)|compactification]]s of extra [[dimension]]s.  A particle of a scalar field Φ, a scalar field that always comes with gravity, and in a dynamical field the resulting dilaton particle parallels the [[graviton]]. For comparison, in standard general relativity, Newton's constant, or equivalently the Planck mass is a constant.

== Exposition ==
In Kaluza–Klein theories, after dimensional reduction, the effective Planck mass varies as some power of the volume of compactified space. This is why volume can turn out as a dilaton in the lower-dimensional [[effective theory]].

Although string theory naturally incorporates [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] that first introduced the dilaton, [[perturbative]] string theories such as [[type I string theory]], [[type II string theory]], and [[heterotic string]] theory already contain the dilaton in the maximal number of 10 dimensions. However, [[M-theory]] in 11 dimensions does not include the dilaton in its spectrum unless [[Compactification (physics)|compactified]]. The dilaton in [[type IIA string theory]] parallels the [[radion (physics)|radion]] of M-theory compactified over a circle, and the dilaton in {{nowrap|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; × E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}} string theory parallels the radion for the [[Hořava&amp;ndash;Witten model]]. (For more on the M-theory origin of the dilaton, see &lt;ref&gt;David S. Berman, Malcolm J. Perry (2006), [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0601141 "M-theory and the string genus expansion"]&lt;/ref&gt;).

In [[string theory]] there is also a dilaton in the [[worldsheet]] CFT - [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]]. The [[exponential function|exponential]] of its [[vacuum expectation value]] determines the [[coupling constant]] ''g'' and the [[Euler characteristic]] {{nowrap|χ {{=}} 2 − 2''g''}} as {{nowrap|∫R {{=}} 2πχ}} for compact worldsheets by the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]], where the genus ''g'' counts the number of handles and thus the number of loops or string interactions described by a specific worldsheet.

:&lt;math&gt;g = \exp(\langle \phi \rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the dynamic variable coupling constant in string theory contrasts the [[quantum field theory]] where it is constant. As long as supersymmetry is unbroken, such scalar fields can take arbitrary values [[Moduli (physics)|moduli]]). However, [[supersymmetry breaking]] usually creates a [[potential energy]] for the scalar fields and the scalar fields localize near a minimum whose position should in principle calculate in string theory.

The dilaton acts like a [[Brans–Dicke theory|Brans–Dicke]] scalar, with the effective [[Planck scale]] depending upon ''both'' the string scale and the dilaton field.

In supersymmetry the [[superpartner]] of the dilaton or here the '''dilatino''', combines with the [[axion]] to form a complex scalar field {{Citation needed|reason=Unclear.|date=May 2018}}.

== Dilaton action ==

The dilaton-gravity action is
:&lt;math&gt;\int d^Dx \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2\kappa} \left( \Phi R - \omega\left[ \Phi \right]\frac{g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu \Phi \partial_\nu \Phi}{\Phi} \right) - V[\Phi] \right]&lt;/math&gt;.
This is more general than Brans–Dicke in vacuum in that we have a dilaton potential.

'''Doubochinski’s pendulum''' is a classical oscillator interacting with a high-frequency field in such a way that the oscillator takes on a discrete set of stable regimes of oscillation, each at a frequency near to the proper frequency of the oscillator, but each with a distinct, "quantized" amplitude.

&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of amplitude quantization in this sort of coupled system was first discovered by the brothers Danil and Yakov Doubochinski in 1968&amp;ndash;69.

A simple demonstration apparatus consists of a mechanical pendulum interacting with a magnetic field (Fig. 1).

&lt;/ref&gt; The system is composed of two interacting oscillatory processes: a pendulum arm with a natural frequency on the order of 0.5&amp;ndash;1&amp;nbsp;Hz, with a small permanent magnet fixed at its moving end; and a stationary electromagnet ([[solenoid]]) positioned under the [[equilibrium point]] of the pendulum’s trajectory and supplied with alternating current of fixed frequency, typically in the range of 10&amp;ndash;1000&amp;nbsp;Hz. The mechanical pendulum arm and solenoid are configured in such a way, that the pendulum arm interacts with the oscillating magnetic field of the solenoid only over a limited portion of its trajectory &amp;ndash; the so-called "zone of interaction" &amp;ndash; outside of which the strength of the magnetic field drops off rapidly to zero. This spatial inhomogeniety of the interaction is key to the quantized behavior and other unusual properties of the system.

When released at any arbitrary starting position, the pendulum’s motion evolves into one of a discrete set of stable oscillation modes, having sharply differing amplitudes, but approximately the same period of oscillation – close to the pendulum’s undisturbed period (Fig. 2). In each such mode, the energy lost by friction in the pendulum’s motion, is compensated by an average net energy transfer from the oscillating magnetic field, in a self-regulating manner.

The stability of each amplitude-mode is maintained by a constant self-adjustment of the phase relationship between the pendulum and the high-frequency field. Through its interaction with the field, the pendulum extracts the amount of energy needed to compensate its frictional losses for a given period. The pendulum compensates for the changes in the strength of the magnetic field,

by slightly shifting the phase of its entry into the zone of interaction, while maintaining almost exactly the same amplitude and frequency. The values of the quantized amplitudes &amp;ndash; and the corresponding energies of the quantized modes &amp;ndash; are essentially independent of the strength of the alternating current supplied to the electromagnet, over a very large range. The higher the applied frequency, the larger the array of stable modes that become accessible to the pendulum (See Table 1).

'''Ercol''' is the name of a British furniture manufacturer. The firm dates back to 1920, when it was established in [[High Wycombe]], Buckinghamshire, as '''Furniture Industries''' by [[Lucian Ercolani]] (1888–1976).

==History==
===Origins===
In 1944, Ercol was contracted by the government [[Board of Trade]] to produce 100,000 low-cost [[Windsor chair]]s – chairs with a [[bentwood]] frame and an arched back supporting delicate spindles. For the order to be a commercial success, Ercol perfected the [[steam bending]] of wood in large quantities. The wood selected was English [[elm]] – a wood previously thought impossible to bend because it distorted. Ercol's innovation meant the chair could be assembled from fourteen pre-formed components, and mechanisation meant that a chair could be made every twenty seconds.

In 1946, Ercol exhibited its [[bentwood]] furniture at the [[Britain Can Make It]] exhibition, held at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. In 1947, the first production-line [[Windsor chair]], and other pieces from the range of Windsor furniture, went on sale. Ercol's mass-produced furniture found a ready market in post-war Britain, which demanded smaller pieces with simpler lines than their chunky pre-war counterparts. Ercol furniture was exhibited at the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]], as it represented the latest style and fashion in furniture design and manufacture.

===Modern day===
In 2002 Ercol moved to a new purpose-built facility in [[Princes Risborough]], Buckinghamshire, where it produces furniture made from North American [[elm]] and European ash, beech, oak and walnut from naturally regenerative forests.  This facility has won a number of awards for its architecture, design and environmental features.  The building's heat and hot water is provided from wood waste, whilst the company does not use solvent-based stains and lacquers, instead using the more environmentally friendly water-based versions. Ercol sources its fabrics from mills in Italy and Belgium, and offers a choice of over 100 different fabrics on its upholstery.  Ercol upholstery, with its solid wood frames, can generally have the cushions replaced when they wear out, prolonging the life of the suite.  It offers a reCover service to supply replacement cushions.

Ercol's ranges of upholstery, dining, cabinet and occasional furniture are on sale through a network of retailers in the UK, Europe, Japan and Korea and directly to other territories, whilst a range of ex-display and factory seconds are available from its factory outlet in Princes Risborough.  Ercol's Gina recliner was the first piece of domestic furniture to be awarded the Ergonomics Excellence award by [[Furniture Industry Research Association|FIRA]], the UK furniture industry's independent furniture test house.  In 2008 Ercol launched two-bedroom ranges – Savona and Paladina – taking it back into the bedroom.

Ercol has been awarded the Manufacturing Guildmark by the [[Worshipful Company of Furniture Makers]] in recognition of its commitment to design and to quality of manufacture. Ercol's Treviso range was shortlisted for the annual Wood Awards held in the autumn of 2009.  In 2010 Ercol was awarded two Design Guild Marks by the [[Worshipful Company of Furniture Makers]] out of only twenty issued for the year.  The Design Guild Mark is issued by Worshipful Company of Furniture Makers – the industry's guild.  The guild mark is awarded "for excellence in the design of furniture.  It will mark and reward the work of the finest designers working in Britain." The first award was in recognition of the designs of the company's founder, Lucian Ercolani, embodied in the Originals range.  The Originals are a small collection of pieces reissued from Ercol's back catalogue.  The Old Man, as he is affectionately known within the company, trained as a furniture designer at [[London College of Fashion|Shoreditch Technical Institute]], making his first piece of furniture in 1907. The Originals collection reflected a break from the heavy, ornate pre-war styles towards a new clean lined, simple elegance.  They were first launched in the late 1950s.

As well as its presence in UK retailers' stores, and its own showroom at its Princes Risborough facility, Ercol attends a number of trade and consumer exhibitions and holds a number of events at its showroom.  In 2009 Ercol will be exhibiting at the design show Trent London which is open to the public and in January 2010 at the national trade show at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC, Birmingham]] Interiors Birmingham.

Ercol partnered design magazine Wallpaper for one of the major installations at the 2009 [[London Design Festival]] – a modern interpretation of the Chair Arch, to be given pride of place in the Central Courtyard of the [[V&amp;A Museum]] in September 2009.  In Victorian times towns would mark a particularly special occasion, such as the visit of a VIP, with an arch adorned with the town's main commodity.  The arch would then form the centre of festivities.  In 1877 High Wycombe, famous for its chair manufacturing, built a chair arch for the visit of [[Queen Victoria]] to [[Disraeli]] at his home, [[Hughenden Manor]].  The idea originated with the Town Council, who deputised it to one of their members, Walter Skull, to organise through the Chair Manufacturers Association.  Just over fifty years later his company, Walter Skull &amp; Son, would become part of Ercol.  Later arches were erected for the visit of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1962 and for the Millennium.  The Ercol-Wallpaper arch will though be dramatically different.  Designed by Martino Gamper, it comprises two overlapping spans, all of the same chair – Ercol's stacking chair. After showing at the V&amp;A it moved in 2010 to the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood]as part of their Sit Down! exhibition of children's seating through the years.

Also as part of the [[London Design Festival]] Ercol also took part in The Dock.  Curated by designer Tom Dixon, Situated at The Portobello Dock, the exhibition was over {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, spanning the Grand Union Canal.

An '''exploding cigar''' is a variety of [[cigar]] that [[Explosive material|explodes]] shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is as a form of hostile [[practical joke]], rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.

Although far rarer than their prank cousins, exploding cigars used as a means to kill or attempt to kill targets in real life has been claimed, and is well represented as a fictional plot device. The most famous case concerning the intentionally deadly variety was an alleged plot by the [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in the 1960s to assassinate [[Cuba|Cuban]] leader [[Fidel Castro]]. Notable real-life incidents involving the non-lethal ilk include an exploding cigar purportedly given by [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to an acquaintance and a dust-up between Turkish military officers and [[Ernest Hemingway]] after he pranked one of them with an exploding cigar.

During the early- to mid-20th century, exploding cigars were a popular practical joke device, frequently advertised and mentioned in newspapers of the era.&lt;ref&gt;A search of Ancestry.com's periodical database of digitized newspapers with the search parameters &lt;code&gt;"exploding cigar"&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;"exploding cigars"&lt;/code&gt; reveals hundreds of relevant newspaper items.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their popularity, the history of the exploding cigar's development is apparently not well documented, including how, where and when they first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Reviewing search results of Google web, news and books and Ancestry.com's periodical database of digitized newspapers with the search parameters &lt;code&gt;"exploding cigar"&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;"exploding cigars"&lt;/code&gt; fails to reveal any dates or sources of invention, beginning use and manufacture, nor where they developed.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest manufacturer and purveyor of exploding cigars in the United States during the middle of the 20th century was the S. S. Adams Company, which, according to ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', made more exploding cigars and other gag novelty items as of 1946 than its next eleven competitors combined.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite book|author= Maurice Zolotow|title=The Jumping Snakes of S.S.

The company was founded by [[Soren Sorensen Adams]], dubbed "king of the professional pranksters", who invented and patented many common gag novelties such as [[sneezing powder]], [[itching powder]], the [[dribble glass]] and the [[Joy Buzzer|joy buzzer]].&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times Company (October 21, 1963).

Retrieved on June 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest New York–based manufacturer of exploding cigars was Richard Appel, a German refugee from [[Nuremberg]], who in or about 1940 opened a gag novelty factory on Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]].&lt;ref&gt;CondéNet (2008). Abstract of the March 30, 1940 issue of [[The New Yorker]], p. 13: [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1940/03/30/1940_03_30_013_TNY_CARDS_000180141 Gagman] by Maurice Zolotow.

By the time exploding cigars were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety had fallen out of favor.&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt; According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 in the aftermath of a death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with dynamite.&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt; Though exploding cigars were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary,&lt;ref name="PopMech"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deitch|first=James|date=March 1952|title=I Was the Gadgeteer For a TV Madhouse|journal=Popular Mechanics|publisher=Hearst Magazines|volume=97|issue= 3|pages=258, 260|issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether.&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt; The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PopMech" /&gt;

However, the decline in the use and advertisement of the exploding cigar was neither complete, nor permanent, and they can be obtained worldwide. In the United States, makers include Don Osvaldo and Hawkins Joke Shop. However, their availability in the USA is limited, as some states, such as Massachusetts, have banned their sale entirely.

Prank exploding cigars have caused many injuries over their history. For example, in 1902 one Edward Weinschreider sued a cigar shop for an exploding cigar which burned his hand so badly three of his fingers had to be amputated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] (October 22, 1902).

''A Comparative Analysis of Minnesota Products Liability Law and the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability.'' 24 William Mitchell Law Review 1 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Laws have been enacted banning the sale of exploding cigars entirely, such as Chapter 178 of Massachusetts' Acts and Resolves, passed by its legislature in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Massachusetts.

==In fiction==
Both prank and intentionally deadly exploding cigars have been featured in numerous works of fiction, spanning many forms of media including literature, film, comics books, cartoons and others. A well-known use of the exploding cigar in literature, for example, appears in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s 1973 novel, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''. In it, the character Etzel Ölsch symbolically betrays his death wish by eagerly smoking a cigar he knows to be of the prank explosive variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Pynchon|title=Gravity's Rainbow|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|page=300|year=1973|isbn=0-14-018859-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Thomas Moore | title=The Style of Connectedness: Gravity's Rainbow and Thomas Pynchon | publisher=University of Missouri Press | location = Columbia | page = 213 | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-8262-0625-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other book examples include [[Robert Coover]]'s 1977 novel, ''[[The Public Burning]]'', where a fictionalized [[Richard Nixon]] hands an exploding cigar to [[Uncle Sam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Evenson|title=Understanding Robert Coover|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, SC|page=118|year=2003|isbn=1-57003-482-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sherburne James' ''Death's Clenched Fist'' (1982), in which a [[Tammany Hall]] politico of the 1890s is murdered with an exploding cigar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynda G.

==In reality==
===Ulysses S. Grant's delayed gift===
According to a 1932 [[Associated Press]] story, U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gave Horace Norton, the founder of a defunct college in Chicago, an exploding cigar soon after being introduced to him, but the "joke" wasn't revealed until many years later.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Associated press|title=Gen. Grant's Gift Cigar Retains Wartime Power|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]], as quoted in full at Snopes.com with citation|page=5|date=December 20, 1932|url=http://www.snopes.com/history/american/grantcigar.asp|accessdate=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the story, unaware of the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was shutting its doors for good, the alumni thought it would be a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This Country Needs Good 5-Cent Exploding Cigar!|date=April 1, 1954|publisher=Dixon Evening Telegraph (Dixon, Ill)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly, [[Ernest Hemingway]], urged on by a group of journalists with whom he was drinking at the Palace Hotel bar in [[Rapallo]], [[Italy]], presented an exploding cigar to one of four bodyguards of Turkish general [[İsmet İnönü]]. When the cigar "went off", all four guards drew their guns and aimed at Hemingway.

[[File:17. Експлозивни својства на три различни типови експлозиви.webm|thumb|right|280px|Demonstration of the explosive properties of three different explosives. Each explosive is set on a solid marble base and is initiated by a glowing wooden stick.]]

An '''explosive material''', also called an '''explosive''', is a reactive substance that contains a great amount of potential energy that can produce an [[explosion]] if released suddenly, usually accompanied by the production of [[light]], [[heat]], [[sound]], and [[pressure]]. An '''explosive charge''' is a measured quantity of explosive material, which may be composed of a single ingredient or a combination of two or more.

The potential energy stored in an explosive material may, for example, be
*[[chemical energy]], such as [[nitroglycerin]] or [[grain dust]]
*[[pressure|pressurized]] [[gas compressor|gas]], such as a [[gas cylinder]] or [[aerosol can]]
*[[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] energy, such as in the [[fissile]] [[isotope]]s [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium-239]]

Explosive materials may be categorized by the speed at which they expand. Materials that [[detonate]] (the front of the chemical reaction moves faster through the material than the [[speed of sound]]) are said to be "high explosives" and materials that [[deflagration|deflagrate]] are said to be "low explosives". Explosives may also be categorized by their [[sensitivity (explosives)|sensitivity]]. Sensitive materials that can be initiated by a relatively small amount of heat or pressure are [[primary explosive]]s and materials that are relatively insensitive are [[secondary explosives|secondary]] or [[tertiary explosive]]s.

A wide variety of chemicals can explode; a smaller number are manufactured specifically for the purpose of being used as explosives. The remainder are too dangerous, sensitive, toxic, expensive, unstable, or prone to decomposition or degradation over short time spans.

In contrast, some materials are merely [[combustible]] or [[flammable]] if they burn without exploding.

The distinction, however, is not razor-sharp. Certain materials—dusts, powders, gases, or volatile organic liquids—may be simply combustible or flammable under ordinary conditions, but become explosive in specific situations or forms, such as [[dust explosion|dispersed airborne clouds]], or [[Gas explosion|confinement or sudden release]].

Though [[early thermal weapons]], such as [[Greek fire]], have existed since ancient times, the first widely used explosive in [[warfare]] and [[mining]] was [[black powder]], invented in 9th century in China by Song Chinese alchemists. This material was sensitive to water, and it produced copious amounts of dark smoke. The first useful explosive stronger than black powder was [[nitroglycerin]], developed in 1847. Since nitroglycerin is a liquid and highly unstable, it was replaced by [[nitrocellulose]], trinitrotoluene ([[TNT]]) in 1863, [[smokeless powder]], [[dynamite]] in 1867 and [[gelignite]] (the latter two being sophisticated stabilized preparations of nitroglycerin rather than chemical alternatives, both invented by [[Alfred Nobel]]). World War I saw the adoption of TNT in artillery shells. World War II saw an extensive use of new explosives (see [[List of explosives used during World War II]]). In turn, these have largely been replaced by more powerful explosives such as [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] and [[PETN]]. However, C-4 and PETN react with metal and catch fire easily, yet unlike TNT, C-4 and PETN are waterproof and malleable.&lt;ref name=ankony1&gt;Ankony, Robert C., ''Lurps: A Ranger's Diary of Tet, Khe Sanh, A Shau, and Quang Tri,'' revised ed., Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing Group, Lanham, MD (2009), p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Blast Area Security.webm|thumb|A video on safety precautions at blast sites]]

===Commercial===
[[File:Handling Explosives in Underground Mines.webm|thumb|A video describing how to safely handle explosives in mines.]]

The largest commercial application of explosives is [[mining]]. Whether the mine is on the surface or is buried underground, the detonation or deflagration of either a high or low explosive in a confined space can be used to liberate a fairly specific sub-volume of a brittle material in a much larger volume of the same or similar material. The mining industry tends to use nitrate-based explosives such as [http://www.idealexplosives.com/emulsion-explosives.html emulsions of fuel oil and ammonium nitrate solutions], mixtures of ammonium nitrate prills (fertilizer pellets) and fuel oil ([[ANFO]]) and [http://www.idealexplosives.com/slurry-explosives.html gelatinous suspensions or slurries] of ammonium nitrate and combustible fuels.

In Materials Science and Engineering, explosives are used in [[Cladding (metalworking)|cladding]] ([[explosion welding]]). A thin plate of some material is placed atop a thick layer of a different material, both layers typically of metal. Atop the thin layer is placed an explosive. At one end of the layer of explosive, the explosion is initiated. The two metallic layers are forced together at high speed and with great force. The explosion spreads from the initiation site throughout the explosive. Ideally, this produces a metallurgical bond between the two layers.

As the length of time the shock wave spends at any point is small, we can see mixing of the two metals and their surface chemistries, through some fraction of the depth, and they tend to be mixed in some way. It is possible that some fraction of the surface material from either layer eventually gets ejected when the end of material is reached. Hence, the mass of the now "welded" bilayer, may be less than the sum of the masses of the two initial layers.

There are applications where a shock wave, and electrostatics, can result in high velocity projectiles.

[[File:GHS-pictogram-explos.svg|thumb|The [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|international]] [[pictogram]] for explosive substances]]

An explosion is a type of spontaneous chemical reaction that, once initiated, is driven by both a large exothermic change (great release of heat) and a large positive [[entropy]] change (great quantities of gases are released) in going from reactants to products, thereby constituting a thermodynamically favorable process in addition to one that propagates very rapidly. Thus, explosives are substances that contain a large amount of energy stored in [[chemical bond]]s. The energetic stability of the gaseous products and hence their generation comes from the formation of strongly bonded species like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and (di)nitrogen, which contain strong double and triple bonds having bond strengths of nearly 1 MJ/mole. Consequently, most commercial explosives are organic compounds containing [[nitro compound|-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[nitrate|-ONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[nitroamine|-NHNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] groups that, when detonated, release gases like the aforementioned (e.g., [[nitroglycerin]], [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[HMX]], [[PETN]], [[nitrocellulose]]).&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Porterfield, ''Inorganic Chemistry: A Unified Approach'', 2nd ed., Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pp. 479-480 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

An explosive is classified as a low or high explosive according to its rate of [[combustion]]: low explosives burn rapidly (or [[deflagration|deflagrate]]), while high explosives [[detonation|detonate]]. While these definitions are distinct, the problem of precisely measuring rapid decomposition makes practical classification of explosives difficult.

Traditional explosives mechanics is based on the shock-sensitive rapid oxidation of carbon and hydrogen to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water in the form of steam. [[Nitrate]]s typically provide the required oxygen to burn the carbon and hydrogen fuel. High explosives tend to have the oxygen, carbon and hydrogen contained in one organic molecule, and less sensitive explosives like ANFO are combinations of fuel (carbon and hydrogen fuel oil) and [[ammonium nitrate]]. A sensitizer such as powdered aluminum may be added to an explosive to increase the energy of the detonation. Once detonated, the nitrogen portion of the explosive formulation emerges as nitrogen gas and toxic [[NOx|nitric oxides]].

====Decomposition====
The [[chemical decomposition]] of an explosive may take years, days, hours, or a fraction of a second. The slower processes of decomposition take place in storage and are of interest only from a stability standpoint. Of more interest are the other two rapid forms besides decomposition: deflagration and detonation.

====Deflagration====
{{Main|Deflagration}}
In deflagration, decomposition of the explosive material is propagated by a flame front which moves slowly through the explosive material at speeds less than the speed of sound within the substance (usually below 1000&amp;nbsp;m/s) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chem-page.de/publikationen/geschichte-der-sprengstoffe/195-2-wie-unterscheiden-sich-deflagration-detonation-und-explosion.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206104750/http://www.chem-page.de/publikationen/geschichte-der-sprengstoffe/195-2-wie-unterscheiden-sich-deflagration-detonation-und-explosion.html |archivedate=6 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}} |2.1 Deflagration |Retrieved 05 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to detonation, which occurs at speeds greater than the speed of sound. Deflagration is a characteristic of [[low explosive]] material.

====Detonation====
{{Main|Detonation}}
This term is used to describe an explosive phenomenon whereby the decomposition is [[wave propagation|propagated]] by an explosive [[shock wave]] traversing the explosive material at speeds greater than the speed of sound within the substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chem-page.de/publikationen/geschichte-der-sprengstoffe/195-2-wie-unterscheiden-sich-deflagration-detonation-und-explosion.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206104750/http://www.chem-page.de/publikationen/geschichte-der-sprengstoffe/195-2-wie-unterscheiden-sich-deflagration-detonation-und-explosion.html |archivedate=6 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}} |2.2 Detonation |Retrieved 05 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The shock front is capable of passing through the high explosive material at supersonic speeds, typically thousands of metres per second.

===Exotic===
In addition to chemical explosives, there are a number of more exotic explosive materials, and exotic methods of causing explosions. Examples include [[nuclear explosive]]s, and abruptly heating a substance to a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state with a high-intensity [[laser]] or [[electric arc]].

Laser- and arc-heating are used in laser detonators, [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s, and [[slapper detonator|exploding foil initiators]], where a shock wave and then detonation in conventional chemical explosive material is created by laser- or electric-arc heating. Laser and electric energy are not currently used in practice to generate most of the required energy, but only to initiate reactions.

==Properties of explosive materials==
To determine the suitability of an explosive substance for a particular use, its [[physics|physical]] [[properties]] must first be known. The usefulness of an explosive can only be appreciated when the properties and the factors affecting them are fully understood. Some of the more important characteristics are listed below:

===Sensitivity===
{{Main|Sensitivity (explosives)}}
Sensitivity refers to the ease with which an explosive can be ignited or detonated, i.e., the amount and intensity of [[electric shock|shock]], [[friction]], or [[heat]] that is required. When the term [[wikt:Sensitivity|sensitivity]] is used, care must be taken to clarify what kind of sensitivity is under discussion. The relative sensitivity of a given explosive to impact may vary greatly from its sensitivity to friction or heat. Some of the test methods used to determine sensitivity relate to:
*'''[[Impact ]]''' — Sensitivity is expressed in terms of the distance through which a standard weight must be dropped onto the material to cause it to explode.
*'''[[Friction (mechanics)|Friction]]''' — Sensitivity is expressed in terms of what occurs when a weighted pendulum scrapes across the material (it may snap, crackle, ignite, and/or explode).
*'''[[Heat]]''' — Sensitivity is expressed in terms of the temperature at which flashing or explosion of the material occurs.

Specific explosives (usually but not always highly sensitive on one or more of the three above axes) may be idiosyncratically sensitive to such factors as pressure drop, acceleration, the presence of sharp edges or rough surfaces, incompatible materials, or even—in rare cases—nuclear or electromagnetic radiation. These factors present special hazards that may rule out any practical utility.

Sensitivity is an important consideration in selecting an explosive for a particular purpose. The explosive in an armor-piercing projectile must be relatively insensitive, or the shock of impact would cause it to detonate before it penetrated to the point desired. The explosive lenses around nuclear charges are also designed to be highly insensitive, to minimize the risk of accidental detonation.

===Sensitivity to initiation===
The index of the capacity of an explosive to be initiated into detonation in a sustained manner. It is defined by the power of the detonator which is certain to prime the explosive to a sustained and continuous detonation. Reference is made to the [[Sellier-Bellot]] scale that consists of a series of 10 detonators, from n. 1 to n. 10, each of which corresponds to an increasing charge weight. In practice, most of the explosives on the market today are sensitive to an n. 8 detonator, where the charge corresponds to 2&amp;nbsp;grams of [[mercury fulminate]].

===Velocity of detonation===
The velocity with which the reaction process propagates in the mass of the explosive. Most commercial mining explosives have detonation velocities ranging from 1800&amp;nbsp;m/s to 8000&amp;nbsp;m/s. Today, velocity of detonation can be measured with accuracy. Together with density it is an important element influencing the yield of the energy transmitted for both atmospheric over-pressure and ground acceleration. By definition, a "low explosive," such as black powder, or smokeless gunpowder has a burn rate of 171–631&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmuqCHDC3pwC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=speed+of+blackpowder+explosion+m/s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ocMDie-r0f&amp;sig=GYtyVdH_c1nsO2gjB4Kps6KGj1g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjos8vqsuLPAhVF0YMKHRTjC7cQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=speed%20of%20blackpowder%20explosion%20m/s&amp;f=false|title=History of Shock Waves, Explosions and Impact: A Chronological and Biographical Reference|last=Krehl|first=Peter O.

K.|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2008|isbn=978-3-540-30421-0|location=|pages=1970|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stability===
{{Main|Chemical stability}}
'''Stability ''' is the ability of an explosive to be stored without [[chemical decomposition|deterioration]].

The following factors affect the stability of an explosive:
*'''[[Chemical constitution]].''' In the strictest technical sense, the word "stability" is a thermodynamic term referring to the energy of a substance relative to a reference state or to some other substance.&lt;!--vague, needs better def--&gt; However, in the context of explosives, stability commonly refers to ease of detonation, which is concerned with [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] (i.e., rate of decomposition). It is perhaps best, then, to differentiate between the terms thermodynamically stable and kinetically stable by referring to the former as "inert." Contrarily, a kinetically unstable substance is said to be "labile." It is generally recognized that certain groups like nitro (–NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrate]] (–ONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[azide]] (–N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), are intrinsically labile. Kinetically, there exists a low activation barrier to the decomposition reaction. Consequently, these compounds exhibit high sensitivity to flame or mechanical shock. The chemical bonding in these compounds is characterized as predominantly covalent and thus they are not thermodynamically stabilized by a high ionic-lattice energy. Furthermore, they generally have positive enthalpies of formation and there is little mechanistic hindrance to internal molecular rearrangement to yield the more thermodynamically stable (more strongly bonded) decomposition products. For example, in [[lead azide]], Pb(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the nitrogen atoms are already bonded to one another, so decomposition into Pb and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; is relatively easy.
*'''[[Temperature]] of storage.''' The rate of decomposition of explosives increases at higher temperatures. All standard military explosives may be considered to have a high degree of stability at temperatures from –10 to +35&amp;nbsp;°C, but each has a high temperature at which its rate of [[thermal decomposition|decomposition]] rapidly accelerates and stability is reduced. As a rule of thumb, most explosives become dangerously unstable at temperatures above 70&amp;nbsp;°C.
*'''Exposure to [[sunlight]].''' When exposed to the [[ultraviolet]] rays of sunlight, many explosive compounds containing [[nitrogen]] groups rapidly decompose, affecting their stability.
*'''[[Electrical discharge]].''' [[Electrostatic discharge|Electrostatic]] or [[electric spark|spark]] sensitivity to initiation is common in a number of explosives. Static or other electrical discharge may be sufficient to cause a reaction, even detonation, under some circumstances. As a result, safe handling of explosives and [[pyrotechnics]] usually requires proper [[ground (electricity)|electrical grounding]] of the operator.

===Power, performance, and strength===
{{Main|Power (physics)|Strength (explosive)}}
The term '''power''' or '''performance''' as applied to an explosive refers to its ability to do work. In practice it is defined as the explosive's ability to accomplish what is intended in the way of energy delivery (i.e., fragment projection, air blast, high-velocity jet, underwater shock and bubble energy, etc.). Explosive power or performance is evaluated by a tailored series of tests to assess the material for its intended use. Of the tests listed below, cylinder expansion and air-blast tests are common to most testing programs, and the others support specific applications.
*'''Cylinder expansion test.''' A standard amount of explosive is loaded into a long hollow [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], usually of copper, and detonated at one end. Data is collected concerning the rate of radial expansion of the cylinder and the maximum cylinder wall velocity. This also establishes the [[Gurney equations|Gurney energy]] or 2''E''.
*'''Cylinder fragmentation.''' A standard steel cylinder is loaded with explosive and detonated in a sawdust pit. The [[fragmentation (weaponry)|fragments]] are collected and the size distribution analyzed.
*'''Detonation pressure ([[Chapman–Jouguet condition]]).''' [[Detonation]] pressure data derived from measurements of shock waves transmitted into water by the detonation of cylindrical explosive charges of a standard size.
*'''Determination of critical diameter.''' This test establishes the minimum physical size a charge of a specific explosive must be to sustain its own detonation wave. The procedure involves the detonation of a series of charges of different diameters until difficulty in detonation wave propagation is observed.
*'''Massive-diameter detonation velocity.''' Detonation velocity is dependent on loading density (c), charge diameter, and grain size. The hydrodynamic theory of detonation used in predicting explosive phenomena does not include the diameter of the charge, and therefore a detonation velocity, for a massive diameter. This procedure requires the firing of a series of charges of the same density and physical structure, but different diameters, and the extrapolation of the resulting detonation velocities to predict the detonation velocity of a charge of a massive diameter.
*'''Pressure versus scaled distance.''' A charge of a specific size is detonated and its pressure effects measured at a standard distance. The values obtained are compared with those for TNT.
*'''Impulse versus scaled distance.''' A charge of a specific size is detonated and its impulse (the area under the pressure-time curve) measured as a function of distance. The results are tabulated and expressed as TNT equivalents.
*'''Relative bubble energy (RBE).''' A 5 to 50&amp;nbsp;kg charge is detonated in water and piezoelectric gauges measure peak pressure, time constant, impulse, and energy.
::The RBE may be defined as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; 3
::RBE = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;
::where ''K'' = the bubble expansion period for an experimental (''x'') or a standard (''s'') charge.

===Brisance===
{{Main|Brisance}}
In addition to strength, explosives display a second characteristic, which is their shattering effect or brisance (from the French meaning to "break"), which is distinguished and separate from their total work capacity. This characteristic is of practical importance in determining the effectiveness of an explosion in fragmenting shells, bomb casings, [[grenade]]s, and the like. The rapidity with which an explosive reaches its peak pressure ([[power (physics)|power]]) is a measure of its brisance. Brisance values are primarily employed in France and Russia.

The sand crush test is commonly employed to determine the relative brisance in comparison to TNT. No test is capable of directly comparing the explosive properties of two or more compounds; it is important to examine the data from several such tests (sand crush, [[trauzl lead block test|trauzl]], and so forth) in order to gauge relative brisance. True values for comparison require field experiments.

===Density===
[[Density]] of loading refers to the mass of an explosive per unit volume. Several methods of loading are available, including pellet loading, cast loading, and press loading, the choice being determined by the characteristics of the explosive. Dependent upon the method employed, an average density of the loaded charge can be obtained that is within 80–99% of the theoretical maximum density of the explosive. High load density can reduce [[sensitivity (explosives)|sensitivity]] by making the [[mass]] more resistant to internal [[friction]]. However, if density is increased to the extent that individual [[crystal]]s are crushed, the explosive may become more sensitive. Increased load density also permits the use of more explosive, thereby increasing the power of the [[warhead]]. It is possible to compress an explosive beyond a point of sensitivity, known also as ''dead-pressing'', in which the material is no longer capable of being reliably initiated, if at all.

===Volatility===
[[Volatility (chemistry)|Volatility]] is the readiness with which a substance [[vaporization|vaporizes]]. Excessive volatility often results in the development of pressure within rounds of ammunition and separation of mixtures into their constituents. Volatility affects the chemical composition of the explosive such that a marked reduction in stability may occur, which results in an increase in the danger of handling.

===Hygroscopicity and water resistance===
The introduction of [[water]] into an explosive is highly undesirable since it reduces the sensitivity, strength, and velocity of detonation of the explosive. [[Hygroscopicity]] is a measure of a material's moisture-absorbing tendencies. Moisture affects explosives adversely by acting as an inert material that absorbs heat when vaporized, and by acting as a solvent medium that can cause undesired chemical reactions. Sensitivity, strength, and velocity of detonation are reduced by inert materials that reduce the continuity of the explosive mass. When the moisture content evaporates during detonation, cooling occurs, which reduces the temperature of reaction. Stability is also affected by the presence of moisture since moisture promotes decomposition of the explosive and, in addition, causes corrosion of the explosive's metal container.

Explosives considerably differ from one another as to their behavior in the presence of water. Gelatin dynamites containing nitroglycerine have a degree of water resistance. Explosives based on [[ammonium nitrate]] have little or no water resistance as ammonium nitrate is highly soluble in water and is hygroscopic.

===Toxicity===
Many explosives are [[toxicity|toxic]] to some extent. Manufacturing inputs can also be organic compounds or hazardous materials that require special handing due to risks (such as [[carcinogen]]s). The decomposition products, residual solids, or gases of some explosives can be toxic, whereas others are harmless, such as carbon dioxide and water.

Examples of harmful by-products are:
*Heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, and barium from primers (observed in high-volume firing ranges)
*Nitric oxides from TNT
*Perchlorates when used in large quantities

"Green explosives" seek to reduce environment and health impacts. An example of such is the lead-free primary explosive copper(I) 5-nitrotetrazolate, an alternative to [[lead azide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8903-green-explosive-is-a-friend-of-the-earth.html |title=Green explosive is a friend of the Earth |publisher=New Scientist |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=12 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112220348/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8903-green-explosive-is-a-friend-of-the-earth.html |archivedate=12 November 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One variety of a green explosive is CDP explosives, whose synthesis does not involve any toxic ingredients, consumes carbon dioxide while detonating and does not release any nitric oxides into the atmosphere when used.

===Explosive train===
{{Main|Explosive train}}
Explosive material may be incorporated in the [[explosive train]] of a device or system. An example is a pyrotechnic lead igniting a booster, which causes the main charge to detonate.

===Volume of products of explosion===
The most widely used explosives are condensed liquids or solids converted to gaseous products by explosive chemical reactions and the energy released by those reactions. The gaseous products of complete reaction are typically [[carbon dioxide]], [[steam]], and [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref name="z&amp;k"&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of Detonation |last=Zel'dovich |first=Yakov |authorlink=Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|first2=A.S. |last2=Kompaneets |authorlink2= |publisher=Academic Press |year=1960|isbn= |pages=208–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaseous volumes computed by the [[ideal gas law]] tend to be too large at high pressures characteristic of explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chemical Process Principles |last=Hougen |first=Olaf A. |authorlink= |first2=Kenneth |last2=Watson |authorlink2= |first3=Roland |last3=Ragatz |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1954|isbn= |pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimate volume expansion may be estimated at three orders of magnitude, or one liter per gram of explosive. Explosives with an oxygen deficit will generate soot or gases like [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]], which may react with surrounding materials such as atmospheric [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name="z&amp;k"/&gt; Attempts to obtain more precise volume estimates must consider the possibility of such side reactions, condensation of steam, and aqueous solubility of gases like carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chemical Calculations |last=Anderson |first=H.V. |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1955|isbn= |page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, CDP detonation is based on the rapid reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon with the abundant release of energy. Rather than produce typical waste gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen and nitric oxides, CDP is different. Instead, the highly energetic reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon vaporizes and pressurizes excess dry ice at the wave front, which is the only gas released from the detonation. The velocity of detonation for CDP formulations can therefore be customized by adjusting the weight percentage of reducing agent and dry ice. CDP detonations produce a large amount of solid materials that can have great commercial value as an abrasive:

Example – CDP Detonation Reaction with Magnesium: XCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2Mg → 2MgO + C + (X-1)CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The products of detonation in this example are magnesium oxide, carbon in various phases including diamond, and vaporized excess carbon dioxide that was not consumed by the amount of magnesium in the explosive formulation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2710026/summary.html|title=Canadian Patent Database / Base de données sur les brevets canadiens|last=Office|first=Government of Canada, Industry Canada, Office of the Deputy Minister, Canadian Intellectual Property|website=brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2016-10-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018221400/http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2710026/summary.html|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxygen balance (OB% or ''Ω'')===
{{Main|Oxygen balance}}
[[Oxygen balance]] is an expression that is used to indicate the degree to which an explosive can be oxidized. If an explosive molecule contains just enough oxygen to convert all of its carbon to carbon dioxide, all of its hydrogen to water, and all of its metal to metal oxide with no excess, the molecule is said to have a zero oxygen balance. The molecule is said to have a positive oxygen balance if it contains more oxygen than is needed and a negative oxygen balance if it contains less oxygen than is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Meyer |first= Rudolf |author2=Josef Köhler|author3=Axel Homburg |title= Explosives, 6th Ed. |publisher= Wiley VCH |year= 2007 |isbn= 3-527-31656-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensitivity, [[strength (explosive)|strength]], and [[brisance]] of an explosive are all somewhat dependent upon oxygen balance and tend to approach their maxima as oxygen balance approaches zero.

Oxygen balance applies to traditional explosives mechanics with the assumption that carbon is oxidized to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide during detonation. In what seems like a paradox to an explosives expert, Cold Detonation Physics uses carbon in its most highly oxidized state as the source of oxygen in the form of carbon dioxide. Oxygen balance, therefore, either does not apply to a CDP formulation or must be calculated without including the carbon in the carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Chemical composition===
A chemical explosive may consist of either a chemically pure compound, such as [[nitroglycerin]], or a mixture of a [[fuel]] and an [[oxidizer]], such as [[black powder]] or [[grain dust]] and air.

====Chemically pure compounds====
Some chemical compounds are unstable in that, when shocked, they react, possibly to the point of detonation. Each molecule of the compound dissociates into two or more new molecules (generally gases) with the release of energy.
*'''[[Nitroglycerin]]''': A highly unstable and sensitive liquid
*'''[[Acetone peroxide]]''': A very unstable white [[organic peroxide]]
*'''[[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]''': Yellow insensitive crystals that can be melted and cast without detonation
*'''[[Cellulose nitrate]]''': A nitrated polymer which can be a high or low explosive depending on nitration level and conditions
*'''[[RDX]]''', '''[[PETN]]''', '''[[HMX]]''': Very powerful explosives which can be used pure or in plastic explosives
**'''[[C4 explosive|C-4]]''' (or Composition C-4): An [[RDX]] [[plastic explosive]] plasticized to be adhesive and malleable

The above compositions may describe most of the explosive material, but a practical explosive will often include small percentages of other substances. For example, [[dynamite]] is a mixture of highly sensitive nitroglycerin with [[sawdust]], powdered [[silica]], or most commonly [[diatomaceous earth]], which act as stabilizers. Plastics and polymers may be added to bind powders of explosive compounds; waxes may be incorporated to make them safer to handle; [[aluminium]] powder may be introduced to increase total energy and blast effects. Explosive compounds are also often "alloyed": HMX or RDX powders may be mixed (typically by melt-casting) with TNT to form [[Octol]] or [[Cyclotol]].

====Mixture of oxidizer and fuel====
An [[oxidizer]] is a pure substance ([[molecule]]) that in a chemical reaction can contribute some atoms of one or more oxidizing elements, in which the [[fuel]] component of the explosive burns. On the simplest level, the oxidizer may itself be an oxidizing [[Chemical element|element]], such as [[gas state|gaseous]] or [[liquid]] [[oxygen]].
*'''[[Black powder]]''': [[Potassium nitrate]], [[charcoal]] and [[sulfur]]
*'''[[Flash powder]]''': Fine metal powder (usually [[aluminium]] or [[magnesium]]) and a strong oxidizer (e.g. [[potassium chlorate]] or [[potassium perchlorate|perchlorate]])
*'''[[Ammonal]]''': [[Ammonium nitrate]] and aluminium powder
*'''[[Armstrong's mixture]]''': [[Potassium chlorate]] and [[red phosphorus]]. This is a very sensitive mixture. It is a primary high explosive in which sulfur is substituted for some or all of the phosphorus to slightly decrease sensitivity.
*Cold Detonation Physics: Combinations of carbon dioxide in the form of dry ice (an untraditional oxygen source), and powdered reducing agents (fuel) like magnesium and aluminum.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
*'''[[Sprengel explosive]]s''': A very general class incorporating any strong oxidizer and highly reactive fuel, although in practice the name was most commonly applied to mixtures of [[chlorate]]s and [[nitroaromatic]]s.
**'''[[ANFO]]''': Ammonium nitrate and [[fuel oil]]
**'''[[Cheddite]]s''': [[Chlorate]]s or [[perchlorate]]s and oil
**'''[[Oxyliquit]]s''': Mixtures of organic materials and [[liquid oxygen]]
**'''[[Panclastite]]s''': Mixtures of organic materials and [[dinitrogen tetroxide]]

===Availability and cost===
The availability and cost of explosives are determined by the availability of the raw materials and the cost, complexity, and safety of the manufacturing operations.

==Classification of explosive materials==

===By sensitivity===

====Primary explosive====
A '''primary explosive''' is an [[explosive]] that is extremely sensitive to stimuli such as [[impact (mechanics)|impact]], [[friction]], [[heat]], [[electrostatic|static electricity]], or [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Some primary explosives are also known as [[contact explosive]]s. A relatively small amount of energy is required for [[initiation (chemistry)|initiation]]. As a very general rule, primary explosives are considered to be those compounds that are more sensitive than [[PETN]]. As a practical measure, primary explosives are sufficiently sensitive that they can be reliably initiated with a blow from a hammer; however, PETN can also usually be initiated in this manner, so this is only a very broad guideline. Additionally, several compounds, such as [[nitrogen triiodide]], are so sensitive that they cannot even be handled without detonating. Nitrogen triiodide is so sensitive that it can be reliably detonated by exposure to [[Alpha particle|alpha radiation]]; it is the only explosive for which this is true. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Primary explosives are often used in [[detonator]]s or to [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] larger charges of less sensitive [[secondary explosives]]. Primary explosives are commonly used in [[blasting cap]]s and [[percussion cap]]s to translate a physical shock signal. In other situations, different signals such as electrical or physical shock, or, in the case of laser detonation systems, light, are used to initiate an action, i.e., an explosion. A small quantity, usually milligrams, is sufficient to initiate a larger charge of explosive that is usually safer to handle.

{{div col end}}

====Secondary explosive====
A '''secondary explosive''' is less sensitive than a primary explosive and requires substantially more energy to be initiated. Because they are less sensitive, they are usable in a wider variety of applications and are safer to handle and store. Secondary explosives are used in larger quantities in an explosive train and are usually initiated by a smaller quantity of a primary explosive.

Examples of secondary explosives include [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and [[RDX]].

====Tertiary explosive====
'''Tertiary explosives''', also called '''blasting agents''', are so insensitive to shock that they cannot be reliably detonated by practical quantities of [[primary explosive]], and instead require an intermediate [[explosive booster]] of [[secondary explosive]]. These are often used for safety and the typically lower costs of material and handling. The largest consumers are large-scale [[mining]] and [[construction]] operations.

Most tertiaries include a fuel and an oxidizer. [[ANFO]] can be a tertiary explosive if its reaction rate is slow.

===By velocity===

====Low explosives====
Low explosives are compounds where the rate of decomposition proceeds through the material at less than the [[speed of sound]]. The decomposition is propagated by a flame front ([[deflagration]]) which travels much more slowly through the explosive material than a [[shock wave]] of a [[high explosive]]. [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|Under normal conditions]], low explosives undergo [[deflagration]] at rates that vary from a few centimetres per second to approximately 400 metres per second. It is possible for them to deflagrate very quickly, producing an effect similar to a [[detonation]]. This can happen under higher [[pressure]] or [[temperature]], which usually occurs when ignited in a confined space.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

A low explosive is usually a mixture of a [[combustible]] substance and an [[oxidant]] that decomposes rapidly (deflagration); however, they burn more slowly than a [[high explosive]], which has an extremely fast burn rate.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Low explosives are normally employed as [[propellant]]s. Included in this group are petroleum products such as [[propane]] and [[gasoline]], [[gunpowder]] (including [[smokeless powder]]), and light [[pyrotechnics]], such as [[flare]]s and [[fireworks]], but can replace high explosives in certain applications, see gas pressure blasting.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

====High explosives====
High explosives (HE) are explosive materials that [[detonate]], meaning that the [[explosion|explosive]] [[shock front]] passes through the material at a [[supersonic]] speed. High explosives detonate with [[explosive velocity]] ranging from 3 to 9&amp;nbsp;km/s. For instance, TNT has a detonation (burn) rate of approximately 5.8&amp;nbsp;km/s (19,000 feet per second), Detonating cord of 6.7&amp;nbsp;km/s (22,000 feet per second), and C-4 about 8.5&amp;nbsp;km/s (29,000 feet per second). They are normally employed in mining, demolition, and military applications. They can be divided into two explosives classes differentiated by [[sensitivity (explosives)|sensitivity]]: [[primary explosive]] and [[secondary explosive]]. The term ''high explosive'' is in contrast with the term ''low explosive'', which explodes ([[Deflagration|deflagrates]]) at a lower rate.

Countless high-explosive compounds are chemically possible, but commercially and militarily important ones have included [[nitroglycerin|NG]], [[TNT]], TNX, [[RDX]], [[HMX]], [[pentaerythritol tetranitrate|PETN]], [[TATB]], and [[hexanitrostilbene|HNS]].

===By composition===

====Priming composition====
Priming compositions are primary explosives mixed with other compositions to control (lessen) the sensitivity of the mixture to the desired property.

For example, [[primary explosive]]s are so sensitive that they need to be stored and shipped in a wet state to prevent accidental initiation.

===By physical form===
{{Main|Use forms of explosives}}
Explosives are often characterized by the physical form that the explosives are produced or used in. These use forms are commonly categorized as:&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite book

===Shipping label classifications===
Shipping labels and tags may include both [[United Nations]] and national markings.

United Nations markings include numbered Hazard Class and Division (HC/D) codes and alphabetic Compatibility Group codes. Though the two are related, they are separate and distinct. Any Compatibility Group designator can be assigned to any Hazard Class and Division. An example of this hybrid marking would be a consumer [[firework]], which is labeled as 1.4G or 1.4S.

Examples of national markings would include [[United States Department of Transportation]] (U.S. DOT) codes.

====United Nations Organization (UNO) Hazard Class and Division (HC/D)====
[[File:Dangclass1.svg|thumb|Explosives warning sign]]
{{See also|HAZMAT Class 1 Explosives}}

The Hazard Class and Division (HC/D) is a numeric designator within a hazard class indicating the character, predominance of associated hazards, and potential for causing personnel casualties and property damage. It is an internationally accepted system that communicates using the minimum amount of markings the primary hazard associated with a substance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpub.com/content/aviation/14313/css/14313_288.htm Table 12-4.—United Nations Organization Hazard Classes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605034021/http://www.tpub.com/content/aviation/14313/css/14313_288.htm |date=5 June 2010}}. Tpub.com. Retrieved on 2010-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Listed below are the Divisions for Class 1 (Explosives):
*'''1.1''' Mass Detonation Hazard. With HC/D 1.1, it is expected that if one item in a container or pallet inadvertently detonates, the explosion will [[sympathetic detonation|sympathetically detonate]] the surrounding items. The explosion could propagate to all or the majority of the items stored together, causing a mass detonation. There will also be fragments from the item's casing and/or structures in the blast area.
*'''1.2''' Non-mass explosion, fragment-producing. HC/D 1.2 is further divided into three subdivisions, HC/D 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3, to account for the magnitude of the effects of an explosion.
*'''1.3''' Mass fire, minor blast or fragment hazard. Propellants and many pyrotechnic items fall into this category. If one item in a package or stack initiates, it will usually propagate to the other items, creating a mass fire.
*'''1.4''' Moderate fire, no blast or fragment. HC/D 1.4 items are listed in the table as explosives with no significant hazard. Most small arms ammunition (including loaded weapons) and some pyrotechnic items fall into this category. If the energetic material in these items inadvertently initiates, most of the energy and fragments will be contained within the storage structure or the item containers themselves.
*'''1.5''' mass detonation hazard, very insensitive.
*'''1.6''' [[detonation]] hazard without mass detonation hazard, extremely insensitive.

====Class 1 Compatibility Group====
Compatibility Group codes are used to indicate storage compatibility for HC/D Class 1 (explosive) materials. Letters are used to designate 13 compatibility groups as follows.

*'''A''': Primary explosive substance (1.1A).
*'''B''': An article containing a primary explosive substance and not containing two or more effective protective features. Some articles, such as detonator assemblies for blasting and primers, cap-type, are included. (1.1B, 1.2B, 1.4B).
*'''C''': Propellant explosive substance or other deflagrating explosive substance or article containing such explosive substance (1.1C, 1.2C, 1.3C, 1.4C). These are bulk [[propellant]]s, propelling charges, and devices containing propellants with or without means of ignition. Examples include single-based propellant, double-based propellant, triple-based propellant, and [[composite propellant]]s, [[solid propellant]] [[rocket motor]]s and ammunition with inert projectiles.
*'''D''': Secondary detonating explosive substance or black powder or article containing a secondary detonating explosive substance, in each case without means of initiation and without a propelling charge, or article containing a primary explosive substance and containing two or more effective protective features. (1.1D, 1.2D, 1.4D, 1.5D).
*'''E''': Article containing a secondary detonating explosive substance without means of initiation, with a propelling charge (other than one containing flammable liquid, gel or [[hypergolic]] liquid) (1.1E, 1.2E, 1.4E).
*'''F''' containing a [[secondary explosive|secondary]] [[detonating explosive]] substance with its means of initiation, with a propelling charge (other than one containing flammable liquid, gel or hypergolic liquid) or without a propelling charge (1.1F, 1.2F, 1.3F, 1.4F).
*'''G''': Pyrotechnic substance or article containing a pyrotechnic substance, or article containing both an explosive substance and an illuminating, incendiary, tear-producing or smoke-producing substance (other than a water-activated article or one containing white phosphorus, phosphide or flammable liquid or gel or hypergolic liquid) (1.1G, 1.2G, 1.3G, 1.4G). Examples include Flares, signals, incendiary or illuminating ammunition and other smoke and tear producing devices.
*'''H''': Article containing both an explosive substance and white phosphorus (1.2H, 1.3H). These articles will spontaneously combust when exposed to the atmosphere.
*'''J''': Article containing both an explosive substance and flammable liquid or gel (1.1J, 1.2J, 1.3J). This excludes liquids or gels which are spontaneously flammable when exposed to water or the atmosphere, which belong in group H. Examples include liquid or gel filled incendiary ammunition, fuel-air explosive (FAE) devices, and flammable liquid fueled missiles.
*'''K''': Article containing both an explosive substance and a toxic chemical agent (1.2K, 1.3K)
*'''L''' Explosive substance or article containing an explosive substance and presenting a special risk (e.g., due to water-activation or presence of hypergolic liquids, phosphides, or pyrophoric substances) needing isolation of each type (1.1L, 1.2L, 1.3L). Damaged or suspect ammunition of any group belongs in this group.
*'''N''': Articles containing only extremely insensitive detonating substances (1.6N).
*'''S''': Substance or article so packed or designed that any hazardous effects arising from accidental functioning are limited to the extent that they do not significantly hinder or prohibit fire fighting or other emergency response efforts in the immediate vicinity of the package (1.4S).

==Regulation==
The legality of possessing or using explosives varies by jurisdiction. Various countries around the world have enacted explosives law and require licenses to manufacture, distribute, store, use, possess explosives or ingredients.

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]], the civil and commercial use of explosives is covered under the ''Wet explosieven voor civiel gebruik'' (explosives for civil use Act), in accordance with EU directive nr. 93/15/EEG&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0006803/geldigheidsdatum_23-12-2013|title=wetten.nl – Wet- en regelgeving – Wet explosieven voor civiel gebruik – BWBR0006803|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225005146/http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0006803/geldigheidsdatum_23-12-2013|archivedate=25 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dutch).

===UK===
The new [[The Explosives Regulation UK|Explosives Regulations 2014]] (ER 2014) came into force on 1 October 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/explosives/new-regulations.htm|title=Explosives Regulations 2014|website=www.hse.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Main|Explosive Substances Act 1883}}

===United States===
During [[World War I]], numerous laws were created to regulate war related industries and increase security within the United States. In 1917, the [[65th United States Congress]] created [[List of United States federal legislation, 1901–2001#65th United States Congress|many laws]], including the ''[[Espionage Act of 1917]]'' and ''Explosives Act of 1917''.

The ''Explosives Act of 1917'' (session 1, chapter 83, {{USStat|40|385}}) was signed on 6 October 1917 and went into effect on 16 November 1917. The legal summary is "An Act to prohibit the manufacture, distribution, storage, use, and possession in '''time of war''' of explosives, providing regulations for the safe manufacture, distribution, storage, use, and possession of the same, and for other purposes". This was the first federal regulation of licensing explosives purchases. The act was deactivated after World War I ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ime.org/content/1913_1919|title=1913 – 1919|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201054704/https://www.ime.org/content/1913_1919|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States entered [[World War II]], the Explosives Act of 1917 was reactivated. In 1947, the act was deactivated by [[President Truman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ime.org/content/1940_1949|title=1940 – 1949|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075716/https://www.ime.org/content/1940_1949|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Organized Crime Control Act of 1970]]'' ({{USPL|91|452}}) transferred many explosives regulations to the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (ATF) of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of Treasury]]. The bill became effective in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ime.org/content/1970_1979|title=1970 – 1979|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117031212/https://www.ime.org/content/1970_1979|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blown_Fuse_Cutout_640.jpg|thumb|269px|fuse cutout visual indication]]
A '''fault indicator''' is a device which provides visual or remote indication of a [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]] on the electric power system.  Also called a faulted circuit indicator (FCI), the device is used in [[electric power distribution]] networks as a means of automatically detecting and identifying [[Fault (power engineering)|faults]] to reduce outage time.

Overhead indicators are used to visualize the occurrence of an electrical fault on an overhead electrical system. Underground indicators locate faults on an underground system.  Often these devices are located in an underground vault.  Some fault indicators communicate back to a central location using radio or cellular signals.

== Basic principles ==
[[File:Lodestar.jpg|thumb|300px|OHL conductor mounted fault indicator. 11 kV distribution network with compensated neutral (GFN), at Ataahua, New Zealand]]
Typically fault indicators sense magnetic field caused by current flows through a conductor or cable. Some of them also use measurement of electric field caused by voltage in conductor.

During an electrical fault on a grounded system, additional current flows through a conductor, [[Magnetic induction|inducing a magnetic field]], which is detected up by the fault indicator causing a state change on the mechanical target flag, [[LED]], or remote indication device. Ground fault indicators for isolated ground systems sense the vector sum of the current and look for an imbalance indicating a fault on one or more of the three phases.

Systems with earthing through high resistance have low phase-to-ground fault currents so require high sensitivity of FI. When there are high load currents and low earth fault levels the line mounted fault indicators should look at the differential increase of the current (di/dt) instead of the absolute value.

In insulated neutral systems and systems with earthing through a Petersen Coil, ground faults cannot be located with classical FI's at all. Capacitive current appears in overall faulted system so directional fault location devices are required.
 
Upon energization of the lines there could be high inrush current which may lead the fault indicators to false operation. Some fault indicators can block inrush current.

Advanced fault indicators should monitor the live line to distinguish fault currents from usual current surges. They operate only after making sure of the feeding circuit breaker/fuse has cut the power flow and the line is de-energized. To monitor the live line, some fault indicators look only at the magnetic field caused by the load current. to be independent from the load current, some FI’s look at the E field to check the voltage directly. This feature is used to reset the indicator after the line is re-energized too. Such indicators can also distinguish permanent faults from transient faults.

Some modern network protection systems e.g. [http://www.swedishneutral.se/main.php?name=gfn GFN] have time to clear a fault as small as possible down to 60ms so fault indicators must not only be highly sensitive and directional but additionally very fast. Modern fault indicators can detect faults with the duration of one cycle 18-20 ms. 
In the networks with low earth fault levels the indicators are required to be set to low values. In such cases the user should consider the downstream capacitive discharge current to avoid false operation of the non-directional indicators.

Some overhead line fault indicators called as pole mounted fault indicators can detect the live line and the fault current from 3 to 5 meters below the conductors.


High-voltage [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] commonly drop down after operating, making it obvious where the fault is. However fuses are rarely equipped with remote communication.

== History ==
The first fault indicators came onto the market from Horstmann (Germany) in 1946. The E.O. Schweitzer Manufacturing Company (now a division of Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc.) introduced a product to the United States in 1948. The first fault indicators were manual reset devices.  Later fault indicators automatically reset on system restoration or after a set period of time. Nortroll (Norway), came to the market in 1977, makes conductor mounted and pole mounted fault indicator using di/dt technic and sensitivity as low as 2.5 Amps. More recent fault indicators communicate their status (tripped or reset) via cell signal or radio to a central station, handheld device, or pole-mounted receiver.

Recent developments include a remotely programmable overhead line indicator, fault indication for paper-insulated lead cable, and an overhead fault indicator for mesh networks.

In [[Scandinavian folklore]], the '''fossegrim''', also known simply as the '''grim''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]) or '''Strömkarlen''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), is a water spirit or troll who plays the fiddle, especially the [[Hardanger fiddle]], and can be induced to teach the skill.

The fossegrim is related to the [[Neck (water spirit)|neck]] or nixie and is sometimes also called ''näcken'' in Sweden, but is associated with rivers (the Swedish name "Strömkarlen" means "The River Man") and particularly with waterfalls (''foss'' in Norwegian) and [[Watermill|mill race]]s.&lt;ref name=Thorpe&gt;[[Benjamin Thorpe]], ''Northern Mythology: comprising the principal popular traditions and superstitions of Scandinavia, north Germany, and the Netherlands'', 3 vols.

The fossegrim is described as an exceptionally talented fiddler: the sounds of forest, wind and water play over his fiddle strings. The Swedish strömkarl's lay is said to have eleven variations, the final one being reserved for the night spirits because when it is played, "tables and benches, cup and can, gray-beards and grandmothers, blind and lame, even babes in the cradle" will begin to dance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Grimm]], ''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology]]'', 4th ed. tr. James Stallybrass, Volume 2, London: Bell, 1883, {{OCLC|457311367}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;492&amp;ndash;93.&lt;/ref&gt; The fossegrim is said to be willing to teach away his skills in exchange for a food offering made on a Thursday evening and in secrecy: a white he-goat thrown with head turned away into a waterfall that flows northwards,&lt;ref name=Thorpe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grimm&gt;Jacob Grimm,  ''Teutonic Mythology'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=fiAAAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA493&amp;dq=Fossegrim+Grimm&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G67bVJTOI4G1ogTK2ICgCw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Fossegrim%20Grimm&amp;f=false p.&amp;nbsp;493].&lt;/ref&gt; or ''fenalår'' (smoked mutton) stolen from the neighbour's storage four Thursdays in a row. If there is not enough meat on the bone, he will only teach the supplicant how to tune the fiddle. If the offering is satisfactory, he will take the pupil's right hand and draw the fingers along the strings until they all bleed, after which he will be able to play so well that "the trees shall dance and torrents in their fall stand still".&lt;ref name=Thorpe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grimm/&gt; [[Jacob Grimm]] cites a variant in Johan Ödman's 18th-century ''Chorographia Bahusiensis'' according to which the strömkarl must be offered [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] or he will merely break his instrument and weep bitterly.&lt;ref name=Grimm/&gt;

Famous fiddlers who were said to have learnt from the fossegrim include Torgeir Augundsson, known as [[Myllarguten]] (who denied it to [[Theodor Kjerulf]]) and [[Ole Bull]], whose statue in the centre of [[Bergen]] depicts a fossegrim playing his harp under the falling water; the sculptor, [[Stephan Sinding]] (1846&amp;ndash;1922), intended it to symbolise his being inspired by Norwegian nature and folklore.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The folklorist [[Rikard Berge]] said that he told the story to the fiddler [[Håvard Gibøen]] when they were both boys but that neither believed it.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6850">A household is said to be in ''' fuel poverty''' when its members cannot afford to keep adequately warm at a reasonable cost, given their income. The term is mainly used in the [[UK]], [[Ireland]] and [[New Zealand]], although discussions on fuel poverty are increasing across Europe,&lt;ref&gt;EU Fuel Poverty Network http://www.fuelpoverty.eu&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept also applies everywhere in the world where poverty may be present.

== Definitions ==
In the UK, fuel poverty is defined by the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act as: “a person is to be regarded as living "in fuel poverty" if he is a member of a household living on a lower income in a home which cannot be kept warm at reasonable cost”.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report}}

 | publisher  = UK National Renewable Energy Centre (Narec)
 | access date = 2013-10-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Statistically, this used to be defined as a household needing to spend more than 10% of its income to maintain an adequate heating regime. However, definitions of "income" and "adequate heating regime" vary between UK Government and Devolved Administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2011-09-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new, more complex definition of fuel poverty is now used in the UK, based on the Hills review.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This gave the following definition: fuel poverty is now defined as when a household’s required fuel costs
are above the median level, and if they were to spend what is required, then the household would be left with a residual income below the official poverty line. Additionally, a Fuel Poverty Indicator has been created, which shows how far into fuel poverty
households are, not simply if they are in poverty or not.

In Eastern Europe ([[transition economies]]), the term [[energy poverty]] is sometimes used instead.&lt;ref&gt;Buzar, S. Energy Poverty in Eastern Europe: Hidden Geographies of Deprivation. Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this use of the term (which is about a lack of access to energy services due to economic poverty) can be confused with indicating a lack of any access to energy infrastructure, as has been used by the [[World Economic Forum]] when establishing its Energy Poverty Action (EPA) initiative in 2005 to address energy poverty in the developing world by implementing electrification schemes (grid-extension and off-grid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Causes of fuel poverty==
Fuel poverty is caused by a convergence of three factors:
* low income, which is often linked to absolute poverty
* high fuel prices, including the use of relatively expensive fuel sources (such as electricity in the UK, aggravated by higher tariffs for low-volume energy users)
* poor [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of a home, e.g. through low levels of insulation and old or inefficient heating systems
The sharp rise in fuel prices from 2006-8 has led to an estimated doubling of the numbers in fuel poverty in countries where it is a major problem.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

A number of illnesses, including [[cancer]] can exacerbate the problems associated with fuel poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Shivering in Acutely Ill Vulnerable Populations|author=Holtzclaw, B|work=AACN Clinical Issues: Advanced Practice in Acute and Critical Care|volume=15|date=April–June 2004|pages=267–279|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{main|Fuel poverty in the United Kingdom}}
Fuel poverty has been the focus of political action since the early 1970s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog |title=A short history of fuel poverty |date=December 7, 2016 |last=Kennard |first=Harry |url=https://www.harrykennard.com/blog/2016/12/7/a-short-history-of-fuel-poverty}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In early 2008 it was estimated by [[Energywatch]] that there were around 4.4 million households in fuel poverty in the UK, with just over 3 million in England alone: this was more than double the number in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Greenprinting can galvanize public support and encourage partners to work toward common conservation goals. Greenprinting often involves use of state-of-the-art maps and models created with [[Geographic Information System]] ([[GIS]]) software that combines layers of spatial and [[demographic]] information to guide [[growth management]] efforts.

A '''heating mantle''', or '''isomantle''', is a piece of [[laboratory equipment]] used to apply heat to containers, as an alternative to other forms of [[heated bath]].  In contrast to other heating devices, such as [[hotplate]]s or [[Bunsen burner]]s, [[glassware]] containers may be placed in direct contact with the heating mantle without substantially increasing the risk of the glassware shattering, because the heating element of a heating mantle is insulated from the container so as to prevent excessive temperature gradients.  
Heating mantles may have various forms.  In a common arrangement, electric wires are embedded within a strip of fabric that can be wrapped around a flask.  The current supplied to the device, and hence the temperature achieved, is regulated by a rheostat.  This type of heating mantle is quite useful for maintaining an intended temperature within a [[separatory funnel]], for example, after the contents of a reaction have been removed from a primary heat source.

Another variety of heating mantle may resemble a paint can and is constructed as a "basket" within a cylindrical canister (often made of [[plastic]] or metal such as [[aluminium]]).  The rigid metal exterior supports a "basket" made of fabric and includes heating elements within the body of the heating mantle.  To heat an object, it is placed within the basket of the heating mantle.

In further contrast to other methods of applying heat to a flask, such as an [[oil bath]] or [[laboratory water bath|water bath]], using a heating mantle generates no liquid residue to drip off the flask.  Also, heating mantles generally distribute heat evenly over the surface of the flask and exhibit less tendency to generate harmful hotspots.

'''Kerosene''', also known as '''paraffin''', '''lamp oil''', and '''coal oil''' (an obsolete term), is a [[combustibility|combustible]] [[hydrocarbon]] liquid which is derived from [[petroleum]]. It is widely used as a [[fuel]] in industry as well as households. Its name derives from {{lang-el|κηρός}} (''keros'') meaning [[wax]], and was registered as a trademark by [[Canadian]] geologist and inventor [[Abraham Pineo Gesner|Abraham Gesner]] in 1854 before evolving into a [[Generic trademark|genericized trademark]]. It is sometimes spelled '''kerosine''' in scientific and industrial usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|dictionary=Webster's New World College Dictionary|article=Kerosene}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''kerosene''' is common in much of [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|dictionary=Oxford English Dictionary|article=Kerosene}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anonymous|title=Environmental Protection Agency lists new kerosene-labeling rules|journal=National Petroleum News|date=August 2006|volume=98|issue=9|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/223291007?accountid=11209|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the term '''paraffin''' (or a closely related variant) is used in [[Chile]], eastern [[Africa]], [[South Africa]], [[Norway]], and in the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ingoeoils.co.uk/kerosene/ What is Kerosene – Ingoe Oils Ltd].

In some of these languages the term ''kerosine'' refers instead to [[jet fuel]]. The term '''lamp oil''', or the equivalent in the local languages, is common in the majority of [[Asia]]. [[Liquid paraffin (drug)|Liquid paraffin]] (called mineral oil in the US) is a more viscous and highly refined product which is used as a laxative. [[Paraffin wax]] is a waxy solid extracted from petroleum.

Kerosene is widely used to power [[jet engine]]s of aircraft ([[jet fuel]]) and some [[rocket engine]]s and is also commonly used as a cooking and lighting fuel and for fire toys such as [[Poi (performance art)#Fire poi|poi]]. In parts of Asia, kerosene is sometimes used as fuel for small [[outboard motor]]s or even [[motorcycle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[Otto engine]]s, used in most cars, petrol or diesel is mixed with air and as vapour explodes in smaller proportions in the cylinders. Whilst kerosene in the combustion chamber of a jet engine (after an initial electrical spark) becomes ignited and then continues to burn. (And as the jet engine's inlet area is larger than its exhaust area, this causes the flame to draw air through the engine. Fans in the front and generators behind the combustion chamber then enforces efficiency.)

To prevent confusion between kerosene and the much more flammable and volatile [[gasoline]], some jurisdictions regulate markings or colorings for containers used to store or dispense kerosene. For example, in the United States, [[Pennsylvania]] requires that portable containers used at retail service stations for kerosene be colored blue, as opposed to red (for [[gasoline]]) or yellow (for [[diesel fuel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Properties ==
Kerosene is a low [[viscosity]], clear liquid formed from hydrocarbons obtained from the [[fractional distillation]] of [[petroleum]] between {{Convert|150 and 275|C||round=5}}, resulting in a mixture with a [[density]] of {{Convert|0.78–0.81|g/cm3|oz/cuin|abbr=on}} composed of carbon chains that typically contain between 10 and 16 [[carbon]] [[atom]]s per [[molecule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Chris|last=Collins|year=2007|title=Implementing Phytoremediation of Petroleum Hydrocarbons|journal=Methods in Biotechnology|issue=23|pages=99–108|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=1-58829-541-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is miscible in petroleum solvents but [[Miscibility|immiscible]] in water.

The [[American Society for Testing and Materials]] standard specification D-3699-78 recognizes two grades of kerosene: grades 1-K (less than 0.04% sulfur by weight) and 2-K (0.3% sulfur by weight). 1-K grade kerosene burns cleaner with fewer deposits, fewer toxins, and less frequent maintenance than 2-K grade kerosene, and is the preferred grade of kerosene for indoor kerosene heaters and stoves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Baldwin's Ohio Monthly Record|title=1301:7-5-10 Fuel for kerosene heaters|volume=2|year=1984|publisher=Banks-Baldwin Law. |page=1109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of crude oil source or processing history, kerosene's major components are branched and straight chain [[alkane]]s and [[naphthene]]s (cycloalkanes), which normally account for at least 70% by volume. [[Aromatic hydrocarbon]]s in this boiling range, such as [[alkylbenzene]]s (single ring) and alkylnaphthalenes (double ring), do not normally exceed 25% by volume of kerosene streams. [[Olefin]]s are usually not present at more than 5% by volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kerosene/Jet Fuel Assessment Document |url=http://www.epa.gov/hpv/pubs/summaries/kerjetfc/c15020ad2.pdf |work=EPA |accessdate=28 October 2016 |author=American Institute of Petroleum |page=8 |date=September 2010 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228144933/http://www.epa.gov/hpv/pubs/summaries/kerjetfc/c15020ad2.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[flash point]] of kerosene is between 37 and 65&amp;nbsp;°C (100 and 150&amp;nbsp;°F), and its [[autoignition temperature]] is {{convert|220|C|F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

1-K grade kerosene freezes around −40&amp;nbsp;°C (−40&amp;nbsp;°F, 233 K).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Ask.com| url=http://www.ask.com/science/freezing-point-kerosene-52221b0bdd2ecc07| accessdate= 14 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heat of combustion]] of kerosene is similar to that of [[diesel fuel]]; its [[lower heating value]] is  43.1 [[megajoule|MJ]]/[[kilogram|kg]] (around 18,500 [[British thermal unit|Btu]]/[[Pound (mass)|lb]]), and its [[higher heating value]] is {{Convert|46.2|MJ/kg|Btu/lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In the United Kingdom, two grades of heating oil are defined. BS 2869 Class C1 is the lightest grade used for lanterns, camping stoves, wick heaters, and mixed with gasoline in some vintage combustion engines as a substitute for [[tractor vaporising oil]]. BS 2869 Class C2 is a heavier distillate, which is used as domestic heating oil. Premium kerosene is usually sold in {{Convert|5 or 20|l||abbr=|sp=us|adj=on}} containers from hardware, camping and garden stores and is often dyed purple.  Standard kerosene is usually dispensed in bulk by a tanker and is undyed.

National and international standards define the properties of several grades of kerosene used for [[jet fuel]]. Flash point and freezing point properties are of particular interest for operation and safety; the standards also define additives for control of [[static electricity]] and other purposes.

[[File:Al-RaziInGerardusCremonensis1250.JPG|thumb|Persian scholar [[Rhazes|Rāzi]] (or Rhazes) was the first to distill kerosene in the 9th century. He is depicted here in a manuscript by [[Gerard of Cremona]].]]

The process of distilling crude oil/petroleum into kerosene, as well as other hydrocarbon compounds, was first written about in the 9th century by the Persian scholar [[Rhazes|Rāzi]] (or Rhazes). In his ''Kitab al-Asrar'' (''Book of Secrets''), the physician and chemist Razi described two methods for the production of kerosene, termed ''naft abyad'' ("white naphtha"), using an apparatus called an [[alembic]]. One method used [[clay]] as an [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]], whereas the other method used [[ammonium chloride]] (''sal ammoniac''). The distillation process was repeated until most of the volatile hydrocarbon fractions had been removed and the final product was perfectly clear and safe to burn. Kerosene was also produced during the same period from [[oil shale]] and [[bitumen]] by heating the rock to extract the oil, which was then distilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Illuminating oil from coal and oil shale===
Although "coal oil" was well known by industrial chemists at least as early as the 1700s as a byproduct of making coal gas and coal tar, it burned with a smoky flame that prevented its use for indoor illumination. In cities, much indoor illumination was provided by piped-in [[coal gas]], but outside the cities, and for spot lighting within the cities, the lucrative market for fueling indoor lamps was supplied by [[whale oil]], specifically that from [[sperm whale]]s, which burned brighter and cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel T. Pees, [http://www.petroleumhistory.org/OilHistory/pages/Whale/whale.html Whale oil versus the others], Petroleum History Institute, accessed 17 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[geologist]] [[Abraham Gesner]] claimed that in 1846, he had given a public demonstration in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]] of a new process he had discovered.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In his book of 1861 and its second edition of 1865, Gesner claimed to have demonstrated ''liquid'' kerosene – an "oil" – in 1846 during his public lectures on Prince Edward's Island.  
*  Gesner, Abraham (1861) [https://archive.org/stream/apracticaltreat02gesngoog#page/n16/mode/2up ''A Practical Treatise on Coal, Petroleum, and Other Distilled Oils.'']  New York, New York, USA:  Bailliere Brothers, p. 9.

However, John Butt characterized Gesner's book as " … a piece of propaganda designed to get people to believe that he had been constantly interested in inventing burning oil from 1846 to 1854."  Butt also stated that "No independent documentary proof has ever been produced to support Gesner's claim."   Furthermore, "He [Gesner] omitted to mention that kerosene had first been used to describe an illuminating gas."

As late as 1850, Gesner promoted his "kerosene" as an illuminating ''gas'':  
* In his U.S. patent of 1850, Gesner called the product of his distillations an "illuminating gas", not an oil:  Gesner, Abraham [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00007052 "Manufacture of illuminating-gas from bitumen"] U.S. Patent no. 7,052 (issued: 29 January 1850).
* In his prospectus of 1850, Gesner repeatedly identified "kerosene" as a ''gas'', not an oil:  Gesner, Abraham (1850) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=aeu.ark:/13960/t9960mm6j;view=1up;seq=7 "Prospectus of Gesner's patent kerosene gas, obtained from bitumen, asphaltum, or mineral pitch."] New York, New York, USA:  Trehern &amp; Williamson.&lt;/ref&gt;  He heated coal in a [[retort]], and distilled from it a clear, thin fluid that he showed made an excellent lamp fuel. He coined the name "kerosene" for his fuel, a contraction of ''keroselaion'', meaning ''wax-oil''.&lt;ref name="russell" &gt;{{Cite book

Gesner recalled from his extensive knowledge of [[New Brunswick]]'s geology a naturally occurring [[asphalt]]um called [[albertite]]. He was blocked from using it by the New Brunswick coal conglomerate because they had coal extraction rights for the province, and he lost a court case when their experts claimed albertite was a form of coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, Gesner moved to [[Newtown Creek]], [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. There, he secured backing from a group of businessmen. They formed the North American Gas Light Company, to which he assigned his patents.

Despite clear priority of discovery, Gesner did not obtain his first kerosene patent until 1854, two years after [[James Young (chemist)|James Young]]'s United States patent.&lt;ref&gt;Gesner, Abraham, "Improvement in kerosene burning-fluids," U.S. Patent no.s [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00011203 11,203] ; [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00011204 11,204] ; [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00011205 11,205] (issued:  27 June 1854).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, James, [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00008833 "Improvement in making paraffine-oil,"] U.S. Patent no. 8,833 (issued:  23 March 1852).&lt;/ref&gt; Gesner's method of purifying the distillation products appears to have been superior to Young's, resulting in a cleaner and better-smelling fuel. Manufacture of kerosene under the Gesner patents began in New York in 1854 and later in [[Boston]]—being distilled from [[bituminous coal]] and [[oil shale]].&lt;ref name=russell/&gt; Gesner registered the word "Kerosene" as a trademark in 1854, and for several years, only the North American Gas Light Company and the Downer Company (to which Gesner had granted the right) were allowed to call their lamp oil "Kerosene" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In 1848, [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[chemist]] [[James Young (chemist)|James Young]] experimented with oil discovered seeping in a coal mine as a source of lubricating oil and illuminating fuel. When the seep became exhausted, he experimented with the dry distillation of coal, especially the resinous "boghead coal" ([[torbanite]]). He extracted a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named ''paraffine oil'' because at low temperatures, it congealed into a substance that resembled paraffin wax. Young took out a patent on his process and the resulting products in 1850, and built the first truly commercial oil-works in the world at [[Bathgate]] in 1851, using oil extracted from locally mined torbanite, shale, and bituminous coal. In 1852, he took out a United States patent for the same invention. These patents were subsequently upheld in both countries in a series of lawsuits, and other producers were obliged to pay him royalties.&lt;ref name=russell/&gt;

[[Ignacy Łukasiewicz]], a [[Poland|Polish]] pharmacist residing in [[Lviv]], and his [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] partner [[:pl:Jan Zeh|Jan Zeh]] had been experimenting with different distillation techniques, trying to improve on Gesner's kerosene process, but using [[petroleum|oil]] from a local [[petroleum seep]]. Many people knew of his work, but paid little attention to it. On the night of 31 July 1853, doctors at the local hospital needed to perform an emergency operation, virtually impossible by candlelight. They therefore sent a messenger for Łukasiewicz and his new lamps. The lamp burned so brightly and cleanly that the hospital officials ordered several lamps plus a large supply of fuel. Łukasiewicz realized the potential of his work and quit the pharmacy to find a business partner, and then travelled to [[Vienna]] to register his technique with the government. Łukasiewicz moved to the [[Gorlice]] region of Poland in 1854, and sank several wells across southern Poland over the following decade, setting up a refinery near [[Jasło]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The petroleum discovery at the [[Drake Well]] in western Pennsylvania in 1859 caused a great deal of public excitement and investment drilling in new wells, not only in Pennsylvania, but also in Canada, where petroleum had been discovered at [[Oil Springs, Ontario]] in 1858, and southern Poland, where Ignacy Łukasiewicz had been distilling lamp oil from petroleum seeps since 1852. The increased supply of petroleum allowed oil refiners to entirely side-step the oil-from-coal patents of both Young and Gesner, and produce illuminating oil from petroleum without paying royalties to anyone. As a result, the illuminating oil industry in the United States completely switched over to petroleum in the 1860s. The petroleum-based illuminating oil was widely sold as Kerosene, and the trade name soon lost its proprietary status, and became the lower-case generic product "kerosene".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lucier, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fNsKrN56RKEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=kerosene+trademark&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FMF6zImmKq&amp;sig=0BrtS4eWN5vqixu2bOYC30Y4bhY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdl5VKDvDsGrogSptIHADQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=kerosene%20trademark&amp;f=false Scientists &amp; Swindlers] (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 2008)232–233.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Gesner’s original Kerosene had been also known as "coal oil," generic kerosene from petroleum was commonly called "coal oil" in some parts of the United States well into the 20th century.

In the United Kingdom, manufacturing oil from coal (or oil shale) continued into the early 20th century, although increasingly overshadowed by petroleum oils.

As kerosene production increased, whaling declined. The American whaling fleet, which had been steadily growing for 50 years, reached its all-time peak of 199 ships in 1858. By 1860, just two years later, the fleet had dropped to 167 ships. The Civil War cut into American whaling temporarily, but only 105 whaling ships returned to sea in 1866, the first full year of peace, and that number dwindled until only 39 American ships set out to hunt whales in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;United States Bureau of the Census, 1960, Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1957, p.445.&lt;/ref&gt; Kerosene, made first from coal and oil shale, then from petroleum, had largely taken over whaling’s lucrative market in lamp oil.

Electric lighting started displacing kerosene as an illuminant in the late 19th century, especially in urban areas. However, kerosene remained the predominant commercial end-use for petroleum refined in the United States until 1909, when it was exceeded by motor fuels. The rise of the gasoline-powered automobile in the early 20th century created a demand for the lighter hydrocarbon fractions, and refiners invented methods to increase the output of gasoline, while decreasing the output of kerosene. In addition, some of the heavier hydrocarbons that previously went into kerosene were incorporated into diesel fuel. Kerosene kept some market share by being increasingly used in stoves and portable heaters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold F. Williamson]] and others, ''The American Petroleum Industry: the Age of Energy, 1899–1959'' (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern Univ. Press, 1963) 170, 172, 194, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, kerosene made up about 0.1 percent by volume of petroleum refinery output in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pnp_pct_dc_nus_pct_a.htm Refinery yield], accessed 29 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[developing country|less-developed countries]] kerosene is an important source of energy for cooking and lighting. It is used as a [[cooking]] fuel in [[portable stove]]s for [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpackers]]. As a heating fuel, it is often used in portable stoves, and is sold in some [[filling station]]s. It is sometimes used as a heat source during power failures.

[[File:Kerosene truck Aichi Japan.jpg|thumb|A truck delivering kerosene in Japan]]
Kerosene is widely used in Japan as a home heating fuel for portable and installed kerosene heaters. In Japan, kerosene can be readily bought at any filling station or be delivered to homes.&lt;ref name="Nagoya"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heating Your Home in Winter: Kerosene Fan Heater|url=http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/archives/423|website=Nagoya International Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, kerosene is often used as a heating fuel in areas not connected to a [[natural gas|gas]] pipeline network. It is used less for cooking, with [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] being preferred because it is easier to light.  Kerosene is often the fuel of choice for range cookers such as [[Rayburn range|Rayburn]]. Additives such as RangeKlene can be put into kerosene to ensure that it burns cleaner and produces less soot when used in range cookers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Additives (KeroKlene and Range Klene)|url=https://craggsenergy.co.uk/info/kerosene/|publisher=Craggs Energy|accessdate=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amish]], who generally abstain from the use of electricity, rely on kerosene for lighting at night.

More ubiquitous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[kerosene heater|kerosene space heaters]] were often built into kitchen ranges, and kept many farm and fishing families warm and dry through the winter. At one time, citrus growers used a [[smudge pot]] fueled by kerosene to create a pall of thick smoke over a grove in an effort to prevent freezing temperatures from damaging crops. "[[Salamander heater|Salamanders]]" are kerosene space heaters used on construction sites to dry out building materials and to warm workers. Before the days of electrically lighted road barriers, highway construction zones were marked at night by kerosene fired, pot-bellied torches. Most of these uses of kerosene created thick black smoke because of the low temperature of combustion.

A notable exception, discovered in the early 19th century, is the use of a [[gas mantle]] mounted above the wick on a kerosene lamp. Looking like a delicate woven bag above the woven cotton wick, the mantle is a residue of mineral materials (mostly [[thorium dioxide]]), heated to [[incandescence]] by the flame from the wick. The [[thorium]] and [[cerium]] oxide combination produces both a whiter light and a greater fraction of the energy in the form of visible light than a [[black body]] at the same temperature would.  These types of lamps are still in use today in areas of the world without electricity, because they give a much better light than a simple wick-type lamp does.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Recently, a multipurpose lantern that doubles as a cook stove has been introduced in India in areas with no electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lanstove-a-lamp-thats-also-a-stove/143262-11.html Lanstove:A lamp that's also a stove].

In countries such as India and Nigeria, kerosene is the main fuel used for cooking, especially by the poor, and kerosene stoves have replaced traditional wood-based cooking appliances. As such, increase in the price of kerosene can have a major political and environmental consequence. The Indian government subsidizes the fuel to keep the price very low, to around 15 U.S. cents per liter as of February 2007, as lower prices discourage dismantling of forests for cooking fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Kerosene is used as a fuel in [[portable stove]]s, especially in [[Primus stove]]s invented in 1892. Portable kerosene stoves earn a reputation of reliable and durable stove in everyday use, and perform especially well under adverse conditions. In outdoor activities and mountaineering, a decisive advantage of [[Portable stove#Pressurized liquid fuel stoves|pressurized kerosene stove]]s over [[Portable stove#Gas cartridge stoves|gas cartridge stoves]] is their particularly high thermal output and their ability to operate at very low temperature in winter or at high altitude.  Wick stoves like Perfection's or wickless like Boss continue to be used by the Amish and off grid living and in natural disasters where there is no power available.

==== Transportation ====
In the mid-20th century, kerosene or [[tractor vaporising oil]] (TVO) was used as a cheap fuel for tractors. The engine would start on gasoline, then switch over to kerosene once the engine warmed up.  A heat valve on the manifold would route the exhaust gases around the intake pipe, heating the kerosene to the point where it was vaporized and could be ignited by an [[electric spark]].

In Europe following the Second World War, automobiles were similarly modified to run on kerosene rather than gasoline, which they would have to import and pay heavy taxes on. Besides additional piping and the switch between fuels, the head gasket was replaced by a much thicker one to diminish the compression ratio (making the engine less powerful and less efficient, but able to run on kerosene). The necessary equipment was sold under the trademark "Econom".&lt;ref name="Corporation1951"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baer|first=Frederick H.|title=Popular Science December 1951|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA193|chapter=Report from abroad on kerosene-fed cars|date=December 1951|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the fuel crisis of the 1970s, Saab-Valmet developed and series-produced the [[Saab 99]] Petro that ran on kerosene, [[turpentine]] or gasoline. The project, codenamed "Project Lapponia", was headed by Simo Vuorio, and towards the end of the 1970s, a working prototype was produced based on the Saab 99 GL. The car was designed to run on two fuels. Gasoline was used for cold starts and when extra power was needed, but normally it ran on kerosene or turpentine. The idea was that the gasoline could be made from peat using the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]]. Between 1980 and 1984, 3,756 Saab 99 Petros and 2,385 [[Talbot Horizon]]s (a version of the Chrysler Horizon that integrated many Saab components) were made. One reason to manufacture kerosene-fueled cars was that in Finland kerosene was less heavily taxed than gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;Bakrutan: "Saab 99 Petro" by Petri Tyrkös, n. 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerosene is used to fuel smaller-horsepower outboard motors built by Yamaha, Suzuki, and Tohatsu. Primarily used on small fishing craft, these are dual-fuel engines that start on gasoline and then transition to kerosene once the engine reaches optimum [[operating temperature]].  Multiple fuel Evinrude and Mercury Racing engines also burn kerosene, as well as jet fuel.&lt;ref&gt;

Today, kerosene is mainly used in [[jet fuel|fuel for jet engines]] in several grades. One highly refined form of the fuel is known as [[RP-1]], and is often burned with [[liquid oxygen]] as rocket fuel. These fuel grade kerosenes meet specifications for [[smoke point]]s and [[freeze point]]s.  The combustion reaction can be approximated as follows, with the molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt; ([[dodecane]]):

2 C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;(''l'') + 37 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'')&amp;nbsp;→ 24 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'')&amp;nbsp;+ 26 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''g''); [[Enthalpy|∆''H''˚]]&amp;nbsp;= -7513 [[Joule|kJ]]

In the initial phase of liftoff, the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle was powered by the reaction of liquid oxygen with RP-1.&lt;ref name="Ebbing" &gt;{{cite book|author=Ebbing, Darrell |title=General Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VakHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-80895-2|pages=251–|date=2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the five 6.4 meganewton sea-level thrust [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]] rocket engines of the Saturn V, burning together, the reaction generated roughly 1.62&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; [[watt]]s (J/s) (162 gigawatt) or 217 million horsepower.&lt;ref name=Ebbing/&gt;

Kerosene is sometimes used as an additive in diesel fuel to prevent gelling or waxing in cold temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/diesel/presentations/keroseneblding.pdf Kerosene blending], (pdf from EPA)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ultra-low sulfur kerosene'' is a custom-blended fuel used by the [[New York City Transit Authority]] to power its bus fleet. The transit agency started using this fuel in 2004, prior to the widespread adoption of [[ultra-low-sulfur diesel]], which has since become the standard. In 2008, the suppliers of the custom fuel failed to tender for a renewal of the transit agency's contract, leading to a negotiated contract at a significantly increased cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/nyregion/25fuel.html|title=How a Plan for Bus Fuel Grew Expensive|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[JP-8]], (for "Jet Propellant 8") a kerosene-based fuel, is used by the United States military as a replacement in diesel fueled vehicles and for powering aircraft. JP-8 is also used by the U.S. military and its NATO allies as a fuel for heaters, stoves, tanks and as a replacement for diesel fuel in the engines of nearly all tactical ground vehicles and electrical generators.

=== In chemistry ===
Kerosene is used as a diluent in the [[PUREX]] extraction process, but it is increasingly being supplanted by [[dodecane]].
In [[X-ray crystallography]], kerosene can be used to store crystals. When a [[hydrated]] crystal is left in air, [[dehydration]] may occur slowly. This makes the color of the crystal become dull. Kerosene can keep air from the crystal.

It can be also used to prevent air from re-dissolving in a boiled liquid,&lt;ref name="KeroseneMiscellaneous"/&gt; and to store alkali metals such as  [[potassium]], [[sodium]], and [[rubidium]] (with the exception of lithium, which is less dense than kerosene, causing it to float).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askiitians.com/iit-jee-s-and-p-block-elements/solved-problems.html|title=S and P Block Elements – Solved Problems for IIT JEE - askIITians|author=|date=|website=www.askiitians.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In entertainment ===
Kerosene is often used in the entertainment industry for fire performances, such as [[fire breathing]], [[Poi (juggling)|fire juggling or poi]], and [[fire dancing]]. Because of its low flame temperature when burnt in free air, the risk is lower should the performer come in contact with the flame. Kerosene is generally not recommended as fuel for indoor fire dancing, as it produces an unpleasant (to some) odor, which becomes poisonous in sufficient concentration. [[Ethanol]] was sometimes used instead, but the flames it produces look less impressive, and its lower [[flash point]] poses a high risk.

=== In industry ===
As a petroleum product miscible with many industrial liquids, kerosene can be used as both a solvent, able to remove other petroleum products, such as chain grease, and as a [[cutting fluid|lubricant]], with less risk of combustion when compared to using [[gasoline]]. It can also be used as a cooling agent in metal production and treatment (oxygen-free conditions).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0026-0657(04)00279-6 | title = Oil atomisation puts a different face on iron alloy powders | journal = Metal Powder Report | volume = 59 | issue = 10 | pages = 26–06 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the petroleum industry, kerosene is often used as a synthetic [[hydrocarbon]] for corrosion experiments to simulate crude oil in field conditions.

=== Others ===
Kerosene can be applied topically to hard-to-remove mucilage or adhesive left by stickers on a glass surface (such as in show windows of stores).&lt;ref name="KeroseneMiscellaneous"&gt;[http://oilfielddirectory.com/oilfield/kerosene.htm Kerosene: Other uses: Miscellaneous]. Oilfielddirectory.com. Retrieved on 2015-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be used to remove candle wax that has dripped onto a glass surface; it is recommended that the excess wax be scraped off prior to applying kerosene via a soaked cloth or tissue paper.&lt;ref name="KeroseneMiscellaneous"/&gt;

It can be used to clean bicycle and motorcycle chains of old lubricant before relubrication.&lt;ref name="KeroseneMiscellaneous"/&gt;

It can also be used to thin oil based paint used in fine art. Some artists even use it to clean their brushes; however, it leaves the bristles greasy to the touch.

== Toxicity ==
[[Ingestion]] of kerosene is harmful or fatal. Kerosene is sometimes recommended as a folk remedy for killing [[head louse|head lice]], but health agencies warn against this as it can cause burns and serious illness. A kerosene shampoo can even be fatal if fumes are inhaled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

People can be exposed to kerosene in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] of 100&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Kerosene|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0366.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mexicali Rose''''' is a 1939 American [[Western (genre)|Western]] film directed by [[George Sherman]] and starring [[Gene Autry]], [[Smiley Burnette]], and [[Noah Beery]]. Based on a story by Luci Ward and Connie Lee, the film is about a singing cowboy who fights corrupt oil men selling worthless stock from a non-existent well located on land belonging to a poor Mexican orphanage.&lt;ref name="magers-130-131"&gt;Magers, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
While singing on a radio program sponsored by Alta Vista Oil Company, Gene Autry meets a beautiful woman, Anita Loredo, when her sweater gets caught on his outfit. Forced to stand with him at the microphone while he sings, Anita smiles sweetly at the singing cowboy whose romantic words are directed at her. After the show, Gene learns that Anita helps run an orphanage in Mexico with her uncle, Padre Dominic. She is upset that the orphanage has yet to see any return on their investment in the oil company—money badly needed to help the children. After confronting the head of the oil company, Carruthers, Gene realizes that his employers are crooked oil promoters trying to peddle the land on which the poor Mexican orphanage is located.

Gene quits his job and travels down to Mexico to investigate. Along the way he meets a Mexican bandit named Valdez who, with Gene's influence, comes to see himself as a modern-day Robin Hood. At the orphanage, Gene is reunited with Anita and meets her uncle. The padre tells Gene that he leased the land to Carruthers on a royalty basis and that the company has no plans of drilling, content making money by selling worthless shares in a non-existent well. Without the royalties, the orphanage will soon go bankrupt.

At a fundraising dance held at the orphanage, Gene sings a romantic song to Anita. Valdez arrives and in keeping with his Robin Hood role, "encourages" those present to contribute to the donation box. Meanwhile, Carruthers' men arrive and kidnap Alta Vista's lead engineer Blythe, who intended to spill the beans on the company's scheme. Gene and Frog chase after them and rescue Blythe who confirms that there is oil in the area.

Gene comes up with a plan to get Carruthers to start drilling. After identifying the land most likely to contain oil, Gene, his sidekick, Frog Millhouse, and Valdez plant oil in the area, upriver from the oil company office. Later, when Carruthers tastes oil in the drinking water, he and his men track the source of the oil and build a derrick on the site, just as Gene had planned. As construction is completed, however, Carruthers learns of Gene's ruse and abandons the well.

Trusting that the site will produce oil, Gene convinces the investors to buy up the rest of Carruthers' stock and drill. When Carruthers learns that there really is oil on the land and that his men have sold all his holdings, he begins a campaign of sabotage hoping to buy back the stock. When two orphans go missing, Gene tracks them to a cabin where Carruthers and his men are holed up. In the ensuing fight, Gene is captured but soon escapes when Valdez arrives on the scene. The orphans are rescued thanks to the heroic efforts of Valdez who sacrifices his life to save the children and dies like a true Robin Hood. As the well comes in, Gene remembers Valdez saying, "He was a true friend."

'''Panduranga Hegde''' is an environmentalist from [[Uttara Kannada]] district, [[Karnataka]], [[India]] and is known as the person who started [[Appiko movement]] to protect trees in [[Western Ghats]].

==Birth and early life==
Panduranga Hegde was born in 1956 in Uttara Kannada District, Karnataka and studied bachelor's degree at [[Karnatak University]]. He worked as Chartered Accountant at Delhi and later trained himself in Social work at [[Delhi School of Social Work]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Environmental Biology|title=Environmental Biology|publisher=Rastogi Publications|isbn=9788171337491|pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent four years in [[Madhya Pradesh]] among rural people with [[Damoh]], a non government organisation. He was attracted by [[Chipko movement]] led by [[Sundarlal Bahuguna]] and got involved with protection of forests and environment.&lt;ref name="ashoka"&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |title=Pandurang Hegde |url=http://india.ashoka.org/fellow/pandurang-hegde |publisher=Ashoka India |location= |date= |archivedate= |accessdate=7 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appiko movement==

[[File:Parabolic trough at Harper Lake in California.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Parabolic trough at a plant near Harper Lake, California]]

A '''parabolic trough''' is a type of [[solar thermal collector]] that is straight in one dimension and curved as a [[parabola]] in the other two, lined with a polished metal [[mirror]]. The [[sunlight]] which enters the mirror parallel to its plane of symmetry is focused along the [[Parabola#Proof of the reflective property|focal line]], where objects are positioned that are intended to be heated. For example, food may be placed at the focal line of a trough, which causes the food to be cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry. Further information on the use of parabolic troughs for cooking can be found in the article about [[Solar cooker#Parabolic troughs|solar cookers]].

For other purposes, there is often a tube, frequently a [[Dewar tube]], which runs the length of the trough at its focal line. The mirror is oriented so that sunlight which it reflects is concentrated on the tube, which contains a [[fluid]] which is heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight. The hot fluid can be used for many purposes. Often, it is piped to a [[heat engine]], which uses the heat energy to drive machinery or to generate electricity. This solar energy collector is the most common and best known type of parabolic trough. The paragraphs below therefore concentrate on this type.

== Efficiency ==

[[File:Parabolic trough.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|A diagram of a parabolic trough solar farm (top), and an end view of how a parabolic collector focuses sunlight onto its focal point.]]

The trough is usually aligned on a north-south axis, and rotated to track the sun as it moves across the sky each day. Alternatively, the trough can be aligned on an east-west axis; this reduces the overall efficiency of the collector due to the sunlight striking the collectors at an angle but only requires the trough to be aligned with the change in [[season]]s, avoiding the need for tracking motors.  This tracking method approaches theoretical efficiencies at the spring and fall [[equinox]]es with less accurate focusing of the light at other times during the year.  The daily motion of the sun across the sky also introduces errors, greatest at the sunrise and sunset and smallest at noon. Due to these sources of error, seasonally adjusted parabolic troughs are generally designed with a lower [[Acceptance angle (solar concentrator)#Concentration acceptance product (CAP)|concentration acceptance product]].

Parabolic trough concentrators have a simple geometry, but their concentration is about 1/3 of the theoretical maximum for the same [[acceptance angle (solar concentrator)|acceptance angle]], that is, for the same overall tolerances of the system to all kinds of errors, including those referenced above. The theoretical maximum is better achieved with more elaborate concentrators based on primary-secondary designs using [[nonimaging optics]]&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1-4822-0673-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roland Winston et al.,, ''Nonimaging Optics'', Academic Press, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-12-759751-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may nearly double the concentration of conventional parabolic troughs&lt;ref name="XXSMS"&gt;Diogo Canavarro et al., ''New second-stage concentrators (XX SMS) for parabolic primaries; Comparison with conventional parabolic trough concentrators'', Solar Energy 92 (2013) 98–105&lt;/ref&gt; and are used to improve practical designs such as those with fixed receivers.&lt;ref name="XXcSMS"&gt;Diogo Canavarro et al., ''Infinitesimal etendue and Simultaneous Multiple Surface (SMS) concentrators for fixed receiver troughs'', Solar Energy 97 (2013) 493–504&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heat-transfer oil|Heat transfer fluid]] (usually [[thermal oil]]) runs through the tube to [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] the concentrated sunlight. This increases the temperature of the fluid to some 400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abengoasolar.es/sites/solar/en/technologies/concentrated_solar_power/parabolic_trough/index.html|title=Absorber tube temperature|website=abengoasolar.es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801143959/http://www.abengoasolar.es/sites/solar/en/technologies/concentrated_solar_power/parabolic_trough/index.html|archivedate=2009-08-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heat transfer fluid is then used to heat steam in a standard turbine generator.  The process is economical and, for heating the pipe, thermal efficiency ranges from 60-80%.
The overall efficiency from collector to grid, i.e. (Electrical Output Power)/(Total Impinging Solar Power) is about 15%, similar to PV (Photovoltaic Cells) but less than [[Stirling engine|Stirling]] [[Solar thermal energy#Dish designs|dish concentrators]].&lt;ref&gt;Patel99 Ch.9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

[[File:Quadric Parabolic Cylinder.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A parabolic trough is shaped as a parabola in the x-y plane, but is linear in the z direction]]

A parabolic trough is made of a number of '''solar collector modules''' ('''SCM''') fixed together to move as one '''solar collector assembly''' ('''SCA'''). A SCM could have a length up to {{convert|15|m|ftin}} or more. About a dozen or more of SCM make each SCA up to {{convert|200|m|ftin}} length. Each SCA is an independently-tracking parabolic trough.

A SCM may be made as a single-piece parabolic mirror or assembled with a number of smaller mirrors in parallel rows. Smaller modular mirrors requires smaller machines to build the mirror, reducing cost. Cost is also reduced in case of the need of replacing a damaged mirror. Such damage may occur due to being hit by an object during bad weather.

In addition, V-type parabolic troughs exist which are made from 2 mirrors and placed at an angle towards each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1978PhDT.......157S|title=Analysis of flat mirror V-trough solar concentrator|first=B. C.|last=Son|date=1 January 1978|publisher=|journal=Ph.D. Thesis|via=NASA ADS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, scientists at the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) and [[SkyFuel]] teamed to develop large curved sheets of metal that have the potential to be 30% less expensive than today's best collectors of [[concentrated solar power]] by replacing glass-based models with a [[silver]] polymer sheet that has the same performance as the heavy glass mirrors, but at a much lower cost and weight. It also is much easier to move and install. The glossy film uses several layers of polymers, with an inner layer of pure silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energyboom.com/solar/award-winning-solar-reflectors-will-cut-production-costs |title=Award-Winning Solar Reflectors Will Cut Production Costs | author= Harry Tournemille |publisher=www.energyboom.com |accessdate=2009-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this renewable source of energy is inconsistent by nature, methods for energy storage have been studied, for instance the single-tank ([[thermocline]]) storage technology for large-scale solar thermal power plants. The thermocline tank approach uses a mixture of silica sand and
quartzite rock to displace a significant portion of the volume in the tank. Then it is filled with the heat transfer fluid, typically a [[Molten salt|molten nitrate salt]].

== Enclosed trough ==

[[File:Inside an enclosed CSP Trough.jpg|thumb|right|Inside an enclosed trough system]]
The enclosed trough architecture encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse. The glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can reduce the reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system.&lt;ref name="2012 pred"&gt;Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, [http://www.deloitte.com/energypredictions2012 "Energy &amp; Resources Predictions 2012"], 2 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended within the glasshouse. A [[Solar tracker|single-axis tracking system]] positions the mirrors to track the sun and focus its light onto a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the glasshouse structure.&lt;ref&gt;Helman, Christopher, [https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0425/features-glasspoint-greenhouses-green-energy-oil-from-sun.html "Oil from the sun"], "Forbes", April 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Steam is generated directly using oil field-quality water, as water flows along the length of the pipes, without heat exchangers or intermediate working fluids.

The steam produced is then fed directly to the field’s existing steam distribution network, where the steam is continuously injected deep into the oil reservoir. Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperatures and prevents dust from building up as a result from exposure to humidity.&lt;ref name="2012 pred" /&gt; [[GlassPoint Solar]], the company that created the Enclosed Trough design, states its technology can produce heat for EOR for about $5 per million British thermal units in sunny regions, compared to between $10 and $12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies.&lt;ref name="ehren chevron"&gt;Goossens, Ehren, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-03/chevron-using-solar-thermal-steam-at-enhanced-oil-recovery-plant.html "Chevron Uses Solar-Thermal Steam to Extract Oil in California"], "Bloomberg", October 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Enclosed troughs are currently being used at the [[Miraah]] solar facility in [[Oman]]. In November 2017, GlassPoint announced a partnership with [[Aera Energy]] that would bring parabolic troughs to the [[South Belridge Oil Field]], near [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mailchi.mp/glasspoint/belridge-solar-announcement|title=GlassPojnt Announces Belridge Solar Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early commercial adoption ==

[[File:US Patent 1240890.pdf|thumb|A 1917 patent drawing for Shuman's parabolic trough solar energy system]]

[[File:Shuman sunengine 1907.jpg|thumb|Shuman sunengine 1907 Photo: Technical World magazine, September 1907]]

In 1897, [[Frank Shuman]], a U.S. inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir [[C. V. Boys|Charles Vernon Boys]],{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;!-- be cautious of circular references --&gt; developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.

Shuman built the world’s first [[Solar thermal energy|solar thermal power station]] in [[Maadi]], [[Egypt]] between 1912 and 1913. Shuman’s plant used parabolic troughs to power a 45-52 kilowatt (60-70&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]]) engine that pumped more than 22,000 litres of water per minute from the [[Nile River]] to adjacent cotton fields.  Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman’s vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{quote|We have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun.|Frank Shuman|New York Times, July 2, 1916&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/07/02/104680095.pdf American Inventor Uses Egypt's Sun for Power; Appliance Concentrates the Heat Rays and Produces Steam, Which Can Be Used to Drive Irrigation Pumps in Hot Climates], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 2, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Commercial plants ==

[[File:Solar Array.jpg|thumb|Array of parabolic troughs.]]

{{Main|List of solar thermal power stations}}

Commercial plants using parabolic troughs may use thermal storage at night while some are hybrids and support [[natural gas]] as a secondary fuel source. In the United States  the amount of fossil fuel used in order for the plant to qualify as a renewable energy source is limited to a maximum 27% of electricity production.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} 
Because they include cooling stations, [[condenser (steam turbine)|condensers]], [[accumulator (energy)|accumulators]] and other things besides the actual solar collectors, the power generated per square meter of area varies enormously.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

As of 2014, the [[List of solar thermal power stations|largest solar thermal power systems]] using parabolic trough technology include the 354&amp;nbsp;MW [[Solar Energy Generating Systems|SEGS]] plants in California, the 280&amp;nbsp;MW [[Solana Generating Station]] with [[molten salt heat storage]], the 250&amp;nbsp;MW [[Genesis Solar Energy Project]], the Spanish 200&amp;nbsp;MW Solaben Solar Power Station, and the [[Andasol Solar Power Station|Andasol 1 solar power station]].&lt;ref&gt;NREL.gov [http://www.nrel.gov/csp/solarpaces/by_country_detail.cfm/country=US Concentrating Solar Power Projects in the United States], 17 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NREL-gov [http://www.nrel.gov/csp/solarpaces/by_country_detail.cfm/country=ES Concentrating Solar Power Projects in Spain], 17 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16278">"'''Peace through strength'''" is a [[phrase]] which suggests that [[military]] [[Power (social and political)|power]] can help preserve [[peace]]. It is quite old and has famously been used by many leaders from [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]] in the [[1st century|first century AD]] to former [[United States|U.S.]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in the 1980s. The concept has long been associated with [[realpolitik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjIrN4WGJUwC&amp;pg=PA325 |page=325 |title=World Politics: The Menu for Choice |author=Bruce Russett |date=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has critics: "'Peace through strength' easily enough becomes 'peace through war,'" according to [[Andrew Bacevich]].

==History==
The phrase and concept date to ancient times. [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]] (AD 76–138) is said to have sought "peace through strength or, failing that, peace through threat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVXFkh-tlBcC |title=Following Hadrian? |author=Elizabeth Speller |publisher=Oxford University Press |date= Oct 14, 2004 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hadrian's Wall]] was a symbol of this policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/mar/14/hadrians-wall-lights-illumination |title=Legions of sightseers attend Hadrian's Wall illumination |author=Martin Wainwright |quote=Designed as a symbol of Hadrian's contemporary-sounding policy of "peace through strength", the wall marked the northern frontier of the Roman empire. |date=14 March 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
The first American President, [[George Washington]], enunciated a policy of peace through strength in his fifth annual message to Congress, the [[1793 State of the Union Address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5qvfCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |title=Invitation to Peace Studies |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Houston Wood |year=2015 |pages=24–25 |accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1FPpEd0sBJQC&amp;pg=PA24 |title=George Washington and the Origins of the American Presidency |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |author=Mark J Rozell |year=2000 |page=24 |accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said:

:"There is a rank due to the United States among nations which will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known that we are at all times ready for war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washs05.asp |title=Fifth Annual Message of George Washington |work=[[1793 State of the Union Address]] |location=Philadelphia |author=[[George Washington]] |date=December 3, 1793 |accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Federalist No. 24]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] argued for peace through strength, stating that strong garrisons in the west and a navy in the east would protect the Union from the threat of Britain and Spain.&lt;ref name=Book5&gt;{{cite book|title=The Federalist Papers|year=1999|publisher=New American Library, a division of Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-451-52881-6|pages=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Peace Through Strength'' (1952) is the title of a book about a defense plan by [[Bernard Baruch]], a [[World War II]] adviser to [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin D.

In 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] used the phrase during his election challenge against [[Jimmy Carter]], accusing the incumbent of weak, vacillating leadership that invited enemies to attack the United States and its allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Politics Starts at the Water’s Edge  |authors=[[Kiron K.

:"We know that peace is the condition under which mankind was meant to flourish. Yet peace does not exist of its own will. It depends on us, on our courage to build it and guard it and pass it on to future generations. George Washington's words may seem hard and cold today, but history has proven him right again and again. "To be prepared for war," he said, "is one of the most effective means of preserving peace." Well, to those who think strength provokes conflict, [[Will Rogers]] had his own answer. He said of the world heavyweight champion of his day: "I've never seen anyone insult [[Jack Dempsey]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reagan2020.us/speeches/address_on_national_security.asp|title=Reagan 2020 - Ronald Reagan - Address on National Security|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On assuming office in January 2017, [[President Trump]] cited the idea of "Peace Through Strength" as central to his overall "America First" foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-national-security-adviser-says-foreign-policy-will-emphasize-peace-through-strength/2017/01/10/e4652c08-d767-11e6-b8b2-cb5164beba6b_story.html |title=Trump’s national security adviser says foreign policy will emphasize ‘peace through strength’ |work=[[Washington Post]] |author=Karen DeYoung |date=January 10, 2017 |accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

For [[Andrew Bacevich]], "belief in the efficacy of military power almost inevitably breeds the temptation to put that power to work. 'Peace through strength' easily enough becomes 'peace through war.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Western Way of War Has Run its Course |author=[[Andrew Bacevich]] |newspaper=[[CBS News]] |date=4 August 2010 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/08/04/opinion/main6742001.shtml |accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim George of [[Australian National University]] used the term to describe part of what he argued was the [[Leo Strauss|Straussian]] and [[neoconservative]] foreign policy of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jim George |date=June 2005 |title=Leo Strauss, Neoconservatism and US Foreign Policy: Esoteric Nihilism and the Bush Doctrine |journal=International Politics |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=174&amp;ndash;202 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mock inversion "strength through peace" has been used on occasion to draw criticism to the militaristic system of diplomacy advocated by "peace through strength".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Polite Protesters: The American Peace Movement of the 1980s |pages=103–104 |author=John Lofland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjCBPMJCz5EC&amp;pg=PA104 |year=1993 |publisher=Syracuse University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio Congressman [[Dennis Kucinich]] adopted the slogan "Strength Through Peace" during his 2008 Presidential run, as part of his platform as a peace candidate in opposition to the Iraq War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzXqCEJPhLMC&amp;pg=PA29 |title=The Race for the 2008 Democratic Nomination: A Book of Editorial Cartoons |editor=Eric Appleman |publisher=Pelican Publishing |year=2008 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark dispute==
During Reagan's presidency, the non-profit [[American Security Council Foundation]] (ASCF) and its for-profit direct-mail provider, Communications Corporation of America, sought to influence United States foreign policy by promoting the idea, but after the Soviet collapse of 1991 ASCF fell into obscurity while other organizations continued to promote the slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americansecuritycouncil.org |title=The American Security Council Mission Statement |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Heritage Foundation]] and the [[Center for Security Policy]] (CSP) have also used the term in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kim R.

'''Petroleum licensing''' or '''exploration license''' is the act of giving licenses (geographical areas at land or sea) to a company or a [[joint venture]] allowing them to search for commercially feasible deposits for the [[extraction of petroleum]].

Each sovereign country distributes licenses in what is typically called a licensing round. The procedure for such, can greatly vary from country to country. The largest change is usually if it is a bid system or a grant system.
In the bid system, each company or [[joint venture]] will offer a bid to gain the rights for the petroleum exploration at the license for a limited period of time. The highest bid, will obtain the rights. 
In the grant system, the license will be granted to the company or joint venture that shows the highest interest and ability for the exploration of the license. This can be shown by the company experience, projected plan for the exploration (by high investment) and or longest presence on the country as a [[petroleum exploration]] company.

== Countries Licensing Rounds ==

*'''[[Malaysia]]''' - The Malaysia Petroleum Management (MPM) is pleased to announce the launch of their ''‘[http://www.hydrocarbondeals.com/?ez=details&amp;id=57604fd0-cfa4-6248-70cc-5a2fdc0910af " '''2018 Exploration Bidding Round''']'''''"'''.
*'''[[United Kingdom]]''' - The [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] (DECC - formerly the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://og.decc.gov.uk/en/olgs/cms/licences/lic_rounds/ Departament of Energy and Climate Change - License information data] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713144120/http://og.decc.gov.uk/en/olgs/cms/licences/lic_rounds/ |date=2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; grants licences. The UKCS (United Kingdom Continental Shelf) is divided into quadrants of 1 degree latitude and one degree longitude. Each quadrant is divided into 30 blocks measuring 10 minutes of latitude and 12 minutes of longitude. Some blocks are divided further into part blocks where some areas are relinquished by previous licensees. For example, block 13/24a is located in quad 13 and is the 24th block and is the 'a' part block. The UK government has traditionally issued licences via periodic (now annual) licensing rounds. Blocks are awarded on the basis of the work programme bid by the participants. The UK government has actively solicited new entrants to the UKCS via "promote" licensing rounds with less demanding terms and the fallow acreage initiative, where non-active licences have to be relinquished.
*'''[[Norway]]''' - The [[Norwegian Petroleum Directorate]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npd.no/en/ Norwegian Petroleum Directorate - in English]&lt;/ref&gt; grants licences. The NCS is also divided into quads of 1 degree by 1 degree. Norwegian licence blocks are larger than British blocks, being 15 minutes of latitude by 20 minutes of longitude (12 blocks in a quad). Like in Britain, there are numerous part blocks formed by re-licensing relinquished areas. One of the attractiveness of the license blocks in Norway are the economical benefits given by its taxation policy. The Norwegian tax system refunds 78% of all directly related exploration costs, which are paid the year after the costs occurred.
*'''[[Denmark]]''' - The Danish Energy Authority&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens.dk/sw11492.asp Danish Energy Authority - in English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518122503/http://www.ens.dk/sw11492.asp |date=2013-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; administers the Danish sector. The Danes also divide their sector of the North Sea into 1 degree by 1 degree quadrants. Their blocks, however, are 10 minutes latitude by 15 minutes longitude. Part blocks exist where partial relinquishments have taken place.
*'''[[Germany]]''' - Germany and the Netherlands share a quadrant and block grid - quadrants are given letters rather than numbers. The blocks are 10 minutes latitude by 20 minutes longitude. Germany has the smallest sectors in the North Sea.
*'''[[Brazil]]''' - The National Petroleum Agency&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anp.gov.br National Petroleum Agency National Petroleum Agency of Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt; grants licenses. The license blocks are named by BT or BM, followed by the state code and a number. BT means the block is onshore, on land. While BM means the block is offshore, at sea.
*'''[[United States]]''' - Oil and gas rights in the onshore US tracts may be owned by private individuals or corporations, states, or the federal government. Rights to explore for oil on privately owned mineral rights tracts are obtained by leases negotiated between the parties. The rules for obtaining licenses to explore on state mineral rights vary from state to state. Federal onshore exploration licenses are obtained through oral competitive bidding. 

:Oil and gas rights in the offshore US are divided between the state and federal governments (''see [[Offshore oil and gas in the United States]]''). Rights to explore on US federal offshore areas are obtained through competitive sealed bids.  Individual tracts are generally {{convert|9|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}.  Current leases being offered in the Gulf of Mexico have 5-year terms for tracts in water depths of less than 400 m, and 8 years for tracts in water greater than 400 m.  Royalty rates are 18.75%.&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Register'', 13 February 2008, v.73, n.30, p.8349-8350.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relinquishment ==

When a petroleum license is granted, the company or join venture is given a limited time for the exploration of the license. If after the limited time, the company has not discovered or performed its minimal obligations (usually agreed with the government as a minimum number of exploration wells and investment on seismic ) the license will be relinquished.
Relinquished licenses can be re-attributed in next licensing rounds, or even kept as relinquished if the government believes there is little interest on that area for the petroleum exploration.

He was involved in student activism and human rights protection before entering the monkhood in 1983. He is the co-founder of [[Sekiyadhamma]], a network of socially engaged monks all over the country. Besides writing and editing books on [[environmentalism|environment]] and [[Buddhism]], he holds training courses on [[nonviolence]] and [[meditation]] as well. He was recently the recipient of the Asian Public Intellectual Fellowship of the [[Nippon Foundation]].

Information from these busts, whether “pocket litter” or computer files, would be used to find more operatives and dismantle cells.

'''R4 nuclear reactor''' was a [[nuclear reactor]] built at [[Marviken, Södermanland|Marviken]] and the fourth nuclear reactor built in [[Sweden]]. It was [[heavy water]] [[neutron moderator|moderated]] and intended for the dual role of 130MWe of power generation as well as [[plutonium]] production. It had a central role in the [[Swedish nuclear weapon programme]]. During the mid 1960s, the [[social democratic]] government officially abandoned the project of designing Swedish nuclear weapons and the Marviken-plant became derelict. It was never loaded with fuel, and the project was cancelled in 1970.

The turbine hall was subsequently used for an oil-fired power station, and the pressure vessel and containment building were subsequently used for experiments into reactor behaviour under accident conditions.

The Nuclear reactor, the oil fired power station and surronding 250 hectares of land and water was acquired by Synthesis Real Estate during 2018.

== Implications ==
This reactor was built as part of the budding nuclear program for Sweden. This reactor's construction began some time during the Cold War(presumably the 1960s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://weburbanist.com/2013/02/10/gone-fission-11-unfinished-nuclear-power-plants/2/|title=11 Unfinished Nuclear Power Plants|last=|first=Steve|date=|website=Weburbanist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large facility was intended to bring power as well as provide plutonium for this upcoming nuclear program. Though, the construction ended in the 1960s, when the nuclear ambition of Sweden was killed. Part of the plant was later used as an oil-fired plant, but the large building remains an unused structure to this day.

The reactor was later used to test nuclear safety equipment, as well as the behavior of nuclear reactors.

[[File:Relais-Finder-12A.webm|thumb|Operation of a 12 A relay]]
[[File:Relay.jpg|thumb|Automotive-style miniature relay, dust cover is taken off]]

A '''relay''' is an [[electric]]ally operated [[switch]]. Many relays use an [[electromagnet]] to mechanically operate a switch, but other operating principles are also used, such as [[solid-state relay]]s. Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a separate low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal. The first relays were used in long distance [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph]] circuits as amplifiers: they repeated the signal coming in from one circuit and re-transmitted it on another circuit. Relays were used extensively in telephone exchanges and early computers to perform logical operations.

A type of relay that can handle the high power required to directly control an electric motor or other loads is called a [[contactor]]. [[Solid-state relay]]s control power circuits with no [[moving parts]], instead using a semiconductor device to perform switching. Relays with calibrated operating characteristics and sometimes multiple operating coils are used to protect electrical circuits from overload or faults; in modern electric power systems these functions are performed by digital instruments still called "[[protective relay]]s".

Magnetic latching relays require one pulse of coil power to move their contacts in one direction, and another, redirected pulse to move them back. Repeated pulses from the same input have no effect. Magnetic latching relays are useful in applications where interrupted power should not be able to transition the contacts.

Magnetic latching relays can have either single or dual coils. On a single coil device, the relay will operate in one direction when power is applied with one polarity, and will reset when the polarity is reversed. On a dual coil device, when polarized voltage is applied to the reset coil the contacts will transition. AC controlled magnetic latch relays have single coils that employ steering diodes to differentiate between operate and reset commands.

== History ==
In 1833, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] developed an electromagnetic relay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Wireless|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NBLEAA6QKYkC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=1830+Electromagnetic+Relay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6096MzKHXAhXIPRoKHXPlBoEQ6AEIRzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=1830%20Electromagnetic%20Relay&amp;f=false|first1=Tapan K.|last1=Sarkar|first2=Robert J.|last2=Mailloux|first3=Arthur A.|last3=Oliner|first4=Magdalena|last4=Salazar-Palma|first5=Dipak L.|last5=Sengupta|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date=2006-01-30|accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American scientist [[Joseph Henry]] is often claimed to have invented a relay in 1835 in order to improve his version of the [[electrical telegraph]], developed earlier in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of Invention: The Makers of the Modern World from Gutenberg to Gates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=Invention+of+the+relay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-mnmT5bJK4no9AT8l4mMAQ&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Invention%20of%20the%20relay&amp;f=false|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The electromechanical relay of Joseph Henry|publisher=Georgi Dalakov|url=http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/relay.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries: All the Milestones in Ingenuity--From the Discovery of Fire to the Invention of the Microwave Oven|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDbQVE3IdTcC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=relay+Joseph+Henry+1835&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GNSIT6PyMJP02wXO3K3GCQ&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=relay%20Joseph%20Henry%201835&amp;f=false|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Joseph Henry: His Life and Work| author=Thomas Coulson | publisher =Princeton University Press| location = Princeton| year = 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed that English inventor [[Edward Davy]] ''"certainly invented the electric relay"''&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last=Gibberd |first=William |year=1966 |id2=davy-edward-1966 |title=Edward Davy |accessdate= 7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his [[electric telegraph]] c.1835.

A simple device, which is now called a relay, was included in the original 1840 [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] patent of [[Samuel Morse]].&lt;ref name="Patent1647"&gt;{{cite patent|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=Xx5AAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=1647|country=US|number=1647|inventor1-first=Samuel E.B.|inventor1-last=Morse|title=Improvement in the Mode of Communicating Information by Signals by the Application of Electromagnetism|pubdate=June 20, 1840}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism described acted as a digital amplifier, repeating the telegraph signal, and thus allowing signals to be propagated as far as desired.&lt;ref name="Patent1647" /&gt;

The word ''relay'' appears in the context of electromagnetic operations from 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Relay|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=relay&amp;searchmode=none|website=EtymOnline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic design and operation ==
[[File:Relay Parts.jpg|thumb|Simple electromechanical relay]]
[[File:Relay2.jpg|thumb|A small cradle relay often used in electronics. The "cradle" term refers to the shape of the relay's armature.]]

A simple electromagnetic relay consists of a coil of wire wrapped around a [[Magnetic core|soft iron core]] (a solenoid), an iron yoke which provides a low [[Magnetic reluctance|reluctance]] path for magnetic flux, a movable iron [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]], and one or more sets of contacts (there are two contacts in the relay pictured). The armature is hinged to the yoke and mechanically linked to one or more sets of moving contacts. The armature is held in place by a [[Spring (device)|spring]] so that when the relay is de-energized there is an air gap in the magnetic circuit. In this condition, one of the two sets of contacts in the relay pictured is closed, and the other set is open. Other relays may have more or fewer sets of contacts depending on their function. The relay in the picture also has a wire connecting the armature to the yoke. This ensures continuity of the circuit between the moving contacts on the armature, and the circuit track on the [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) via the [[yoke]], which is soldered to the PCB.

When an [[electric current]] is passed through the coil it generates a [[magnetic field]] that activates the armature, and the consequent movement of the movable contact(s) either makes or breaks (depending upon construction) a connection with a fixed contact. If the set of contacts was closed when the relay was de-energized, then the movement opens the contacts and breaks the connection, and vice versa if the contacts were open. When the current to the coil is switched off, the armature is returned by a force, approximately half as strong as the magnetic force, to its relaxed position. Usually this force is provided by a spring, but gravity is also used commonly in industrial motor starters.  Most relays are manufactured to operate quickly. In a low-voltage application this reduces noise; in a high voltage or current application it reduces [[#Undesired arcing|arcing]].

When the coil is energized with [[direct current]], a [[diode]] is often placed across the coil to dissipate the energy from the collapsing magnetic field at deactivation, which would otherwise generate a [[voltage spike]] dangerous to [[semiconductor]] circuit components. Such diodes were not widely used before the application of [[transistor]]s as relay drivers, but soon became ubiquitous as early [[Bipolar junction transistor#Germanium transistors|germanium transistors]] were easily destroyed by this surge. Some automotive relays include a diode inside the relay case.

If the relay is driving a large, or especially a [[Electrical reactance|reactive]] load, there may be a similar problem of surge currents around the relay output contacts. In this case a [[snubber]] circuit (a capacitor and resistor in series) across the contacts may absorb the surge. Suitably rated capacitors and the associated resistor are sold as a single packaged component for this commonplace use.

If the coil is designed to be energized with [[alternating current]] (AC), some method is used to split the flux into two out-of-phase components which add together, increasing the minimum pull on the armature during the AC cycle. Typically this is done with a small copper "shading ring" crimped around a portion of the core that creates the delayed, out-of-phase component,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Art &amp; Science of Protective Relaying, Chapter 2, GE Consumer &amp; Electrical | last= Mason |first= C. R. | url = http://www.gedigitalenergy.com/multilin/notes/artsci/ | accessdate = October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds the contacts during the zero crossings of the control voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|conference=Electrical Contacts|title=Design of Shading Coils for Minimizing the Contact Bouncing of AC Contactors|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224355001_Design_of_Shading_Coils_for_Minimizing_the_Contact_Bouncing_of_AC_Contactors|first1=J.R.|last1=Riba|first2=A.G.|last2=Espinosa|first3=J.|last3=Cusidó|first4=J.A.|last4=Ortega|first5=L.|last5=Romeral|date=November 2008|accessdate=2018-01-07|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact materials for relays vary by application. Materials with low contact resistance may be oxidized by the air, or may tend to "stick" instead of cleanly parting when opening.  Contact material may be optimized for low electrical resistance, high strength to withstand repeated operations, or high capacity to withstand the heat of an arc.  Where very low resistance is required, or low thermally-induced voltages are desired, gold-plated contacts may be used, along with palladium and other non-oxidizing, semi-precious metals.  Silver or silver-plated contacts are used for signal switching. Mercury-wetted relays make and break circuits using a thin, self-renewing film of liquid mercury. For higher-power relays switching many amperes, such as motor circuit contatctors, contacts are made with a mixtures of silver and cadmium oxide, providing low contact resistance and high resistance to the heat of arcing. Contacts used in circuits carrying scores or hundreds of amperes may include additional structures for heat dissipation and management of the arc produced when interrupting the circuit.&lt;ref&gt; Ian Sinclair, ''Passive Components for Circuit Design'', Elsevier, 2000 {{ISBN|008051359X}},pp. 161-164 &lt;/ref&gt; Some relays have field-replaceable contacts, such as certain machine tool relays; these may be replaced when worn out, or changed between normally open and normally closed state, to allow for changes in the controlled circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph E.|last=Fleckenstein|title=Three-Phase Electrical Power|publisher=CRC Press|date=2017|isbn=1498737781|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Coaxial relay ===
Where radio transmitters and receivers share one antenna, often a coaxial relay is used as a TR (transmit-receive) relay, which switches the antenna from the receiver to the transmitter. This protects the receiver from the high power of the transmitter. Such relays are often used in [[transceiver]]s which combine transmitter and receiver in one unit. The relay contacts are designed not to reflect any radio frequency power back toward the source, and to provide very high isolation between receiver and transmitter terminals. The [[characteristic impedance]] of the relay is matched to the [[transmission line]] impedance of the system, for example, 50 ohms.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Sinclair, ''Passive Components for Circuit Design'', Newnes, 2000 {{ISBN|008051359X}}, page 170&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contactor ===
{{Main article|Contactor}}

A [[contactor]] is a heavy-duty relay with higher current ratings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Terrell |editor1-last=Croft |editor2-first=Wilford |editor2-last=Summers |title=American Electricians' Handbook |edition=Eleventh |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York |date=1987 |isbn=0-07-013932-6 |page=7{{hyphen}}124&lt;!--HYPHEN PAGE--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; used for switching [[electric motor]]s and lighting loads. Continuous current ratings for common contactors range from 10 amps to several hundred amps. High-current contacts are made with alloys containing [[silver]]. The unavoidable arcing causes the contacts to oxidize; however, [[silver oxide]] is still a good conductor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Electrical control for machines |first1=Kenneth B. |last1=Rexford |first2=Peter R. |last2=Giuliani |edition=6th |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7668-6198-5 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5RkbwbYq1joC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contactors with overload protection devices are often used to start motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contactor or Motor Starter – What is the Difference?|url=http://eecoonline.com/contactor-or-motor-starter/|website=EECOOnline.com|accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Force-guided contacts relay ===
A 'force-guided contacts relay' has relay contacts that are mechanically linked together, so that when the relay coil is energized or de-energized, all of the linked contacts move together. If one set of contacts in the relay becomes immobilized, no other contact of the same relay will be able to move. The function of force-guided contacts is to enable the safety circuit to check the status of the relay. Force-guided contacts are also known as "positive-guided contacts", "captive contacts", "locked contacts", "mechanically linked contacts", or "safety relays".

These safety relays have to follow design rules and manufacturing rules that are defined in one main machinery standard EN 50205 : Relays with forcibly guided (mechanically linked) contacts. These rules for the safety design are the one that are defined in type B standards such as EN 13849-2 as Basic safety principles and Well-tried safety principles for machinery that applies to all machines.

Force-guided contacts by themselves can not guarantee that all contacts are in the same state, however they do guarantee, subject to no gross mechanical fault, that no contacts are in opposite states. Otherwise, a relay with several normally open (NO) contacts may stick when energised, with some contacts closed and others still slightly open, due to mechanical tolerances. Similarly, a relay with several normally closed (NC) contacts may stick to the unenergised position, so that when energised, the circuit through one set of contacts is broken, with a marginal gap, while the other remains closed. By introducing both NO and NC contacts, or more commonly, changeover contacts, on the same relay, it then becomes possible to guarantee that if any NC contact is closed, all NO contacts are open, and conversely, if any NO contact is closed, all NC contacts are open. It is not possible to reliably ensure that any particular contact is closed, except by potentially intrusive and safety-degrading sensing of its circuit conditions, however in safety systems it is usually the NO state that is most important, and as explained above, this is reliably verifiable by detecting the closure of a contact of opposite sense.

Force-guided contact relays are made with different main contact sets, either NO, NC or changeover, and one or more auxiliary contact sets, often of reduced current or voltage rating, used for the monitoring system. Contacts may be  all NO, all NC, changeover, or a mixture of these, for the monitoring contacts, so that the safety system designer can select the correct configuration for the particular application. Safety relays are used as part of an engineered safety system.

=== Latching relay ===
&lt;!-- [[Latching relay]] redirects here. --&gt;
[[File:Latching relay bistable permanent magnet.jpg|thumb|Latching relay with permanent magnet]]

A ''latching relay'' (also called "latch", "impulse", "bistable", "keep", or "stay" relays) maintains either contact position indefinitely without power applied to the coil. The advantage is that one coil consumes power only for an instant while the relay is being switched, and the relay contacts retain this setting across a power outage. A latching relay allows remote control of building lighting without the hum that may be produced from a continuously (AC) energized coil.

In one mechanism, two opposing coils with an over-center spring or permanent magnet hold the contacts in position after the coil is de-energized. A pulse to one coil turns the relay on and a pulse to the opposite coil turns the relay off. This type is widely used where control is from simple switches or single-ended outputs of a control system, and such relays are found in [[avionics]] and numerous industrial applications.

Another latching type has a [[Remanence|remanent]] core that retains the contacts in the operated position by the remanent magnetism in the core. This type requires a current pulse of opposite polarity to release the contacts.  A variation uses a permanent magnet that produces part of the force required to close the contact; the coil supplies sufficient force to move the contact open or closed by aiding or opposing the field of the permanent magnet.&lt;ref name=IRS2001&gt;{{citation |last=Sinclair |first=Ian R. |title=Sensors and Transducers |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7506-4932-2 |page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; A polarity controlled relay needs changeover switches or an [[H bridge]] drive circuit to control it. The relay may be less expensive than other types, but this is partly offset by the increased costs in the external circuit.

In another type, a ratchet relay has a ratchet mechanism that holds the contacts closed after the coil is momentarily energized. A second impulse, in the same or a separate coil, releases the contacts.&lt;ref name=IRS2001 /&gt; This type may be found in certain cars, for [[headlamp]] dipping and other functions where alternating operation on each switch actuation is needed.

A [[Stepping switch|stepping relay]] is a specialized kind of multi-way latching relay designed for early automatic [[telephone exchange]]s.

An [[earth leakage circuit breaker]] includes a specialized latching relay.

Very [[Mechanical computer#Electro-mechanical computers|early computers]] often stored bits in a magnetically latching relay, such as [[ferreed]] or the later [[remreed]] in the [[1ESS switch]].

Some early computers used ordinary relays as a kind of [[latch (electronics)|latch]]—they store bits in ordinary wire spring relays or reed relays by feeding an output wire back as an input, resulting in a feedback loop or [[sequential circuit]]. Such an electrically latching relay requires continuous power to maintain state, unlike magnetically latching relays or mechanically racheting relays.

In computer memories, latching relays and other relays were replaced by [[delay line memory]], which in turn was replaced by a series of ever-faster and ever-smaller memory technologies.

===Machine tool relay===
A '''machine tool relay''' is a type standardized for industrial control of machine tools, transfer machines, and other sequential control. They are characterized by a large number of contacts (sometimes extendable in the field) which are easily converted from normally open to normally closed status, easily replaceable coils, and a [[Design|form factor]] that allows compactly installing many relays in a control panel. Although such relays once were the backbone of automation in such industries as automobile assembly, the [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC) mostly displaced the machine tool relay from sequential control applications.

A relay allows circuits to be switched by electrical equipment: for example, a timer circuit with a relay could switch power at a preset time. For many years relays were the standard method of controlling industrial electronic systems.  A number of relays could be used together to carry out complex functions ([[relay logic]]). The principle of relay logic is based on relays which energize and de-energize associated contacts.  Relay logic is the predecessor of [[ladder logic]], which is commonly used in [[programmable logic controller]]s.

=== Mercury relay ===
A [[mercury relay]] is a relay that uses mercury as the switching element. They are used where contact erosion would be a problem for conventional relay contacts. Owing to environmental considerations about significant amount of mercury used and modern alternatives, they are now comparatively uncommon.

=== Mercury-wetted relay ===
{{See also|Mercury switch}}
[[File:Clare HGRM-55211-P00 mercury-wetted reed relay.jpg|thumb|A mercury-wetted reed relay]]

A '''mercury-wetted reed relay''' is a form of reed relay in which the contacts are wetted with [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Such relays are used to switch low-voltage signals (one volt or less) where the mercury reduces the contact resistance and associated voltage drop, for low-current signals where surface contamination may make for a poor contact, or for high-speed applications where the mercury eliminates contact bounce. Mercury wetted relays are position-sensitive and must be mounted according to the manufacturer's specifications to work properly. Because of the toxicity and expense of liquid mercury, these relays are now rarely used.

The mercury-wetted relay has one particular advantage, in that the contact closure appears to be virtually instantaneous, as the mercury globules on each contact [[coalescence (physics)|coalesce]]. The current rise time through the contacts is generally considered to be a few picoseconds, however in a practical circuit it will be limited by the [[inductance]] of the contacts and wiring. It was quite common, before the restrictions on the use of mercury, to use a mercury-wetted relay in the laboratory as a convenient means of generating fast rise time pulses, however although the rise time may be picoseconds, the exact timing of the event is, like all other types of relay, subject to considerable jitter, possibly milliseconds, due to mechanical imperfections.

The same coalescence process causes another effect, which is a nuisance in some applications. The contact resistance is not stable immediately after contact closure, and drifts, mostly downwards, for several seconds after closure, the change perhaps being 0.5&amp;nbsp;ohm.

=== Multi-voltage relays ===
'''Multi-voltage relays''' are devices designed to work for wide voltage ranges such as 24 to 240 VAC and VDC and wide frequency ranges such as 0 to 300&amp;nbsp;Hz.  They are indicated for use in installations that do not have stable supply voltages.

=== Overload protection relay ===
Electric motors need [[overcurrent]] protection to prevent damage from over-loading the motor, or to protect against short circuits in connecting cables or internal faults in the motor windings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last = Zocholl
| first = Stan
| title = AC Motor Protection
| publisher = Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories
| year = 2003
| isbn = 978-0972502610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overload sensing devices are a form of heat operated relay where a coil heats a [[bimetallic strip]], or where a solder pot melts, to operate auxiliary contacts. These auxiliary contacts are in series with the motor's contactor coil, so they turn off the motor when it overheats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Principle of Thermal Motor Protection Relay|url=http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/working-principle-of-thermal-motor-protection-relay|website=Electrical-Engineering-Portal.com|publisher=Electrical Engineering Portal|author=Edvard|date=2013-03-09|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thermal protection operates relatively slowly allowing the motor to draw higher starting currents before the protection relay will trip. Where the overload relay is exposed to the same ambient temperature as the motor, a useful though crude compensation for motor ambient temperature is provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Coordinated Power Systems Protection|issue=811-814|journal=Department of the Army technical manual|publisher=[[United States Department of the Army]]|date=1991|page=3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other common overload protection system uses an electromagnet coil in series with the motor circuit that directly operates contacts. This is similar to a control relay but requires a rather high fault current to operate the contacts. To prevent short over current spikes from causing nuisance triggering the armature movement is damped with a [[dashpot]]. The thermal and magnetic overload detections are typically used together in a motor protection relay.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Electronic overload protection relays measure motor current and can estimate motor winding temperature using a "thermal model" of the motor armature system that can be set to provide more accurate motor protection. Some motor protection relays include temperature detector inputs for direct measurement from a [[thermocouple]] or [[resistance thermometer]] sensor embedded in the winding.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Polarized relay ===
A '''polarized relay''' places the armature between the poles of a permanent magnet to increase sensitivity.  Polarized relays were used in middle 20th Century [[Crossbar switch|telephone exchanges]] to detect faint pulses and correct [[Distortion#Teletypewriter or modem signaling|telegraphic distortion]].

=== Reed relay ===
{{Main article|Reed relay}}
[[File:Reedrelay.jpg|thumb|Top, middle: reed switches, bottom: reed relay]]

A [[reed relay]] is a [[reed switch]] enclosed in a solenoid. The switch has a set of contacts inside an [[Vacuum|evacuated]] or [[inert gas]]-filled glass tube which protects the contacts against atmospheric [[corrosion]]; the contacts are made of [[magnet]]ic material that makes them move under the influence of the field of the enclosing solenoid or an external magnet.

Reed relays can switch faster than larger relays and require very little power from the control circuit. However, they have relatively low switching current and voltage ratings. Though rare, the reeds can become magnetized over time, which makes them stick 'on' even when no current is present; changing the orientation of the reeds with respect to the solenoid's magnetic field can resolve this problem.

Sealed contacts with mercury-wetted contacts have longer operating lives and less contact chatter than any other kind of relay.&lt;ref name="keller" /&gt;

=== Safety relays ===
{{Main article|Safety relay}}

'''Safety relays''' are devices which generally implement safety functions. In the event of a hazard, the task of such a safety function is to use appropriate measures to reduce the existing risk to an acceptable level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilz.com/imperia/md/content/editors_mm/safety_compendium_en_2014_01.pdf|title=Safety Compendium, Chapter 4 Safe control technology|page=115|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solid-state contactor ===
A '''solid-state contactor''' is a heavy-duty solid state relay, including the necessary heat sink, used where frequent on-off cycles are required, such as with electric heaters, small [[electric motor]]s, and lighting loads.  There are no moving parts to wear out and there is no contact bounce due to vibration.  They are activated by AC control signals or DC control signals from [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs), PCs, [[transistor-transistor logic]] (TTL) sources, or other microprocessor and microcontroller controls.

=== Solid-state relay ===
{{Main article|Solid-state relay}}
[[File:Solid state relay.jpg|thumb|[[Solid state (electronics)|Solid-state]] relays have no moving parts.]]
[[File:Solid-state-contactor.jpg|thumb|25&amp;nbsp;A and 40&amp;nbsp;A solid state contactors]]

A '''solid-state relay''' ('''SSR''') is a [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] electronic component that provides a function similar to an [[electromechanical]] relay but does not have any moving components, increasing long-term reliability. A solid-state relay uses a [[thyristor]], [[TRIAC]] or other solid-state switching device, activated by the control signal, to switch the controlled load, instead of a solenoid. An [[optocoupler]] (a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) coupled with a [[photo transistor]]) can be used to isolate control and controlled circuits.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Static relay ===
{{Main article|Static relay}}

A '''static relay''' consists of electronic circuitry to emulate all those characteristics which are achieved by moving parts in an electro-magnetic relay.

=== Time delay relay ===
Timing relays are arranged for an intentional delay in operating their contacts. A very short (a fraction of a second) delay would use a copper disk between the armature and moving blade assembly. Current flowing in the disk maintains magnetic field for a short time, lengthening release time. For a slightly longer (up to a minute) delay, a dashpot is used. A dashpot is a piston filled with fluid that is allowed to escape slowly; both air-filled and oil-filled dashpots are used. The time period can be varied by increasing or decreasing the flow rate.  For longer time periods, a mechanical clockwork timer is installed. Relays may be arranged for a fixed timing period, or may be field adjustable, or remotely set from a control panel. Modern microprocessor-based timing relays provide precision timing over a great range.

Some relays are constructed with a kind of "shock absorber" mechanism attached to the armature which prevents immediate, full motion when the coil is either energized or de-energized. This addition gives the relay the property of time-delay actuation. Time-delay relays can be constructed to delay armature motion on coil energization, de-energization, or both.

Time-delay relay contacts must be specified not only as either normally open or normally closed, but whether the delay operates in the direction of closing or in the direction of opening. The following is a description of the four basic types of time-delay relay contacts.

First we have the normally open, timed-closed (NOTC) contact. This type of contact is normally open when the coil is unpowered (de-energized). The contact is closed by the application of power to the relay coil, but only after the coil has been continuously powered for the specified amount of time. In other words, the direction of the contact's motion (either to close or to open) is identical to a regular NO contact, but there is a delay in closing direction. Because the delay occurs in the direction of coil energization, this type of contact is alternatively known as a normally open, on-delay.

=== Vacuum relays ===
A sensitive relay having its contacts mounted in a highly evacuated glass housing, to permit handling radio-frequency voltages as high as 20,000 volts without flashover between contacts even though contact spacing is but a few hundredths of an inch when open.

== Pole and throw ==
[[File:Relay symbols.svg|thumb|Circuit symbols of relays (C denotes the common terminal in SPDT and DPDT types.)]]

Since relays are [[switch]]es, the terminology applied to switches is also applied to relays; a relay switches one or more ''poles'', each of whose [[Electrical contacts|contacts]] can be ''thrown'' by energizing the coil.  Normally open (NO) contacts connect the circuit when the relay is activated; the circuit is disconnected when the relay is inactive.  Normally closed (NC) contacts disconnect the circuit when the relay is activated; the circuit is connected when the relay is inactive.  All of the contact forms involve combinations of NO and NC connections.

The National Association of Relay Manufacturers and its successor, the Relay and Switch Industry Association define 23 distinct [[Electrical contact#Contact form|electrical contact forms]] found in relays and switches.&lt;ref&gt;Section 1.6, Engineers' Relay Handbook, 5th ed, Relay and Switch Industry Association, Arlington, VA; 3rd ed, National Association of Relay Manufacturers, Elkhart Ind., 1980; 2nd Ed. Hayden, New York, 1966; large parts of the 5th edition are on line [http://www.esterline.com/powersystems/DesignReference/RelayHandbook.aspx here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705143411/http://www.esterline.com/powersystems/DesignReference/RelayHandbook.aspx |date=2017-07-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of these, the following are commonly encountered:
* ''SPST-NO'' (Single-Pole Single-Throw, Normally-Open) relays have a single [[Electrical contacts#Form A|''Form A'']] contact or ''make'' contact.  These have two terminals which can be connected or disconnected. Including two for the coil, such a relay has four terminals in total.
* ''SPST-NC'' (Single-Pole Single-Throw, Normally-Closed) relays have a single [[Electrical contacts#Form B|''Form B'']] or ''break'' contact.  As with an SPST-NO relay, such a relay has four terminals in total.
* ''SPDT'' (Single-Pole Double-Throw) relays have a single set of [[Electrical contact#Form C|''Form C'']], ''break before make'' or ''transfer'' contacts.  That is, a common terminal connects to either of two others, never connecting to both at the same time.  Including two for the coil, such a relay has a total of five terminals.
* ''DPST'' – Double-Pole Single-Throw relays are equivalent to a pair of SPST switches or relays actuated by a single coil.  Including two for the coil, such a relay has a total of six terminals.  The poles may be [[Electrical contacts#Form A|''Form A'']] or [[Electrical contacts#Form B|''Form B'']] (or one of each; the designations ''NO'' and ''NC'' should be used to resolve the ambiguity).
* ''DPDT'' – Double-Pole Double-Throw relays have two sets of [[Electrical contacts#Form C|''Form C'']] contacts.  These are equivalent to two SPDT switches or relays actuated by a single coil.  Such a relay has eight terminals, including the coil
*Form D – make before break&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexandrovich|first=George|date=|title=The Audio Engineer's Handbook|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-DB-Magazine/60s/DB-1968-09.pdf|journal=db: The Sound Engineering Magazine|volume=September 1968|pages=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Form E – combination of D and B&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The ''S'' (''single'') or ''D'' (''double'') designator for the pole count may be replaced with a number, indicating multiple contacts connected to a single [[actuator]].  For example, 4PDT indicates a four-pole double-throw relay that has 12 switching terminals.

'''EN 50005''' are among applicable standards for relay terminal numbering; a typical EN 50005-compliant SPDT relay's terminals would be numbered 11, 12, 14, A1 and A2 for the C, NC, NO, and coil connections, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;EN 50005:1976
"Specification for low voltage switchgear and controlgear for industrial use. Terminal marking and distinctive number. General rules." (1976). In the UK published by  BSI as BS 5472:1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DIN 72552]] defines contact numbers in relays for automotive use;
* 85 = relay coil -
* 86 = relay coil +
* 87 = common contact
* 87a = normally closed contact
* 87b = normally open contact

== Applications ==
[[File:ACRelay.jpg|thumb|upright|A DPDT AC coil relay with "ice cube" packaging]]

Relays are used wherever it is necessary to control a high power or high voltage circuit with a low power circuit, especially when [[galvanic isolation]] is desirable. The first application of relays was in long [[electric telegraph|telegraph]] lines, where the weak signal received at an intermediate station could control a contact, regenerating the signal for further transmission. High-voltage or high-current devices can be controlled with small, low voltage wiring and pilots switches. Operators can be isolated from the high voltage circuit. Low power devices such as [[microprocessor]]s can drive relays to control electrical loads beyond their direct drive capability. In an automobile, a starter relay allows the high current of the cranking motor to be controlled with small wiring and contacts in the ignition key.

Electromechanical switching systems including [[Strowger switch|Strowger]] and [[Crossbar Switch|Crossbar]] telephone exchanges made extensive use of relays in ancillary control circuits. The Relay Automatic Telephone Company also manufactured telephone exchanges based solely on relay switching techniques designed by [[:sv:Gotthilf Betulander|Gotthilf Ansgarius Betulander]]. The first public relay based telephone exchange in the  [[UK]] was installed in [[Fleetwood]] on 15 July 1922 and remained in service until 1959.&lt;ref name="Graces Guide"&gt;{{cite web | title = Relay Automatic Telephone Company | url = http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Relay_Automatic_Telephone_Co | accessdate = October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="British Telecom History"&gt;{{cite web | title = British Telecom History 1912-1968 | url = http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/btshistory/1912to1968/1922.htm | accessdate = October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of relays for the logical control of complex switching systems like telephone exchanges  was studied by [[Claude Shannon]], who formalized the application of [[Boolean algebra]] to relay circuit design in [[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits]].  Relays can perform the basic operations of Boolean combinatorial logic.  For example, the boolean AND function is realised by connecting normally open relay contacts in series, the OR function by connecting normally open contacts in parallel. Inversion of a logical input can be done with a normally closed contact. Relays were used for control of automated systems for machine tools and production lines. The [[Ladder programming language]] is often used for designing [[relay logic]] networks.

Early [[mechanical computer#Electro-mechanical computers|electro-mechanical computers]] such as the [[ARRA (computer)|ARRA]], [[Harvard Mark II]], [[Zuse Z2]], and [[Zuse Z3]] used relays for logic and working registers. However, electronic devices proved faster and easier to use.

Because relays are much more resistant than semiconductors to nuclear radiation, they are widely used in safety-critical logic, such as the control panels of radioactive waste-handling machinery. Electromechanical [[protective relay]]s are used to detect overload and other faults on electrical lines by opening and closing [[circuit breaker]]s.

== Relay application considerations ==
[[File:Uy-multi1-hy.jpg|thumb|Several 30-contact relays in "Connector" circuits in mid 20th century [[1XB switch]] and [[5XB switch]] telephone exchanges; cover removed on one]]

Selection of an appropriate relay for a particular application requires evaluation of many different factors:
* Number and type of contacts – normally open, normally closed, (double-throw)
* Contact sequence – "Make before Break" or "Break before Make".  For example, the old style telephone exchanges required Make-before-break so that the connection didn't get dropped while dialing the number.
* Contact current rating – small relays switch a few amperes, large contactors are rated for up to 3000 amperes, alternating or direct current
* Contact voltage rating – typical control relays rated 300 VAC or 600 VAC, automotive types to 50 VDC, special high-voltage relays to about 15,000&amp;nbsp;V
* Operating lifetime, useful life - the number of times the relay can be expected to operate reliably. There is both a mechanical life and a contact life. The contact life is affected by the type of load switched. Breaking load current causes [[relay#Undesired arcing|undesired arcing]] between the contacts, eventually leading to contacts that weld shut or contacts that fail due erosion by the arc.&lt;ref name="electronic-components.com.au"&gt;{{cite web | title = Arc Suppression to Protect Relays From Destructive Arc Energy | url = http://www.electronic-components.com.au/products-services/arc-suppression/ | accessdate = December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Coil voltage – machine-tool relays usually 24 VDC, 120 or 250 VAC, relays for switchgear may have 125 V or 250 VDC coils, 
* Coil current - Minimum current required for reliable operation and minimum holding current, as well as, effects of power dissipation on coil temperature, at various [[duty cycle]]s. "Sensitive" relays operate on a few milliamperes
* Package/enclosure – open, touch-safe, double-voltage for isolation between circuits, [[explosion proof]], outdoor, oil and splash resistant, washable for [[printed circuit]] board assembly
* Operating environment - minimum and maximum operating temperature and other environmental considerations such as effects of humidity and salt
* Assembly – Some relays feature a sticker that keeps the enclosure sealed to allow PCB post soldering cleaning, which is removed once assembly is complete.
* Mounting – sockets, plug board, rail mount, panel mount, through-panel mount, enclosure for mounting on walls or equipment
* Switching time – where high speed is required
* "Dry" contacts – when switching very low level signals, special contact materials may be needed such as gold-plated contacts
* Contact protection – suppress arcing in very inductive circuits
* Coil protection – suppress the surge voltage produced when switching the coil current
* Isolation between coil contacts
* Aerospace or radiation-resistant testing, special quality assurance
* Expected mechanical loads due to [[acceleration]] – some relays used in [[aerospace]] applications are designed to function in [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]] loads of 50 [[G-force|''g'']] or more
* Size - smaller relays often resist mechanical vibration and shock better than larger relays, because of the lower inertia of the moving parts and the higher natural frequencies of smaller parts.&lt;ref name="keller"&gt;

There are many considerations involved in the correct selection of a control relay for a particular application.  These considerations include factors such as speed of operation, sensitivity, and [[hysteresis]].  Although typical control relays operate in the 5 ms to 20 ms range, relays with switching speeds as fast as 100 us are available.  [[Reed relay]]s which are actuated by low currents and switch fast are suitable for controlling small currents.

As with any switch, the contact current (unrelated to the coil current) must not exceed a given value to avoid damage. In high-[[inductance]] circuits such as [[electric motor|motors]], other issues must be addressed. When an inductance is connected to a power source, an [[inrush current|input surge current or electromotor starting current]] larger than the steady-state current exists. When the circuit is broken, the current cannot change instantaneously, which creates a potentially damaging arc across the separating contacts.

Consequently, for relays used to control inductive loads, we must specify the maximum current that may flow through the relay contacts when it actuates, the ''make rating''; the continuous rating; and the ''break rating''. The make rating may be several times larger than the continuous rating, which is itself larger than the break rating.

=== Arcing ===
{{Main article|Arc suppression}}

Switching while "wet" (under load) causes undesired arcing between the contacts, eventually leading to contacts that weld shut or contacts that fail due to a buildup of surface damage caused by the destructive arc energy.&lt;ref name="electronic-components.com.au" /&gt;

Inside the [[1ESS switch]] [[matrix switch]] and certain other high-reliability designs, the reed switches are always switched "dry" (without load) to avoid that problem, leading to much longer contact life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Al L. |last=Varney |url=http://yarchive.net/phone/1ess.html |title=Questions About The No. 1 ESS Switch |date= 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without adequate [[contact protection]], the occurrence of [[Electric arc|electric current arcing]] causes significant degradation of the contacts, which suffer significant and visible damage. Every time the relay contacts open or close under load, an electrical arc can occur between the contacts of the relay, either a ''break'' arc (when opening), or a ''make'' / ''[[contact bounce|bounce]]'' arc (when closing). In many situations, the ''break'' arc is more energetic and thus more destructive, in particular with resistive-type loads. However, inductive loads can cause more destructive ''make'' arcs. For example, with standard electric motors, the start-up (inrush) current tends to be much greater than the running current. This translates into significant ''make'' arcs.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} 
 
During an arc event, the heat energy contained in the electrical arc is very high (tens of thousands of degrees Fahrenheit), causing the metal on the contact surfaces to melt, pool, and migrate with the current. The extremely high temperature of the arc cracks the surrounding gas molecules, creating [[ozone]], [[carbon monoxide]], and other compounds. Over time, the arc energy slowly destroys the contact metal, causing some material to escape into the air as fine particulate matter. This action causes the material in the contacts to degrade, resulting in device failure. This contact degradation drastically limits the overall life of a relay to a range of about 10,000 to 100,000 operations, a level far below the mechanical life of the same device, which can be in excess of 20 million operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lab Note #105: Contact Life - Unsuppressed vs. Suppressed Arcing | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/ | accessdate = October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protective relays ==
{{Main|protective relay}}

For protection of electrical apparatus and transmission lines, electromechanical relays with accurate operating characteristics were used to detect overload, short-circuits, and other faults. While many such relays remain in use, [[digital protective relay]]s now provide equivalent and more complex protective functions.

== Railway signalling ==
[[File:Relay room.jpg|thumb|Part of a relay interlocking using UK Q-style miniature plug-in relays]]

[[Railway signalling]] relays are large considering the mostly small voltages (less than 120&amp;nbsp;V) and currents (perhaps 100&amp;nbsp;mA) that they switch. Contacts are widely spaced to prevent flashovers and short circuits over a lifetime that may exceed fifty years.

Since rail signal circuits must be highly reliable, special techniques are used to detect and prevent failures in the relay system. To protect against false feeds, [[double switching]] relay contacts are often used on both the positive and negative side of a circuit, so that two false feeds are needed to cause a false signal.  Not all relay circuits can be proved so there is reliance on construction features such as carbon to silver contacts to resist lightning induced contact welding and to provide AC immunity.

[[Opto-isolator]]s are also used in some instances with railway signalling, especially where only a single contact is to be switched.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3931">Started in Canada in 1985, '''Responsible Care&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt;''' is a global, voluntary initiative developed autonomously by the [[chemical industry]] for the chemical industry. It runs in 67 countries whose combined chemical industries account for nearly 90% of global chemical production.  96 of the 100 largest chemical producers in the world have adopted Responsible Care.

It stands for the chemical industry's desire to improve health, safety, and environmental performance.

The signatory chemical companies agree to commit themselves to improve their performances in the fields of [[environmental protection]], occupational safety and health protection, plant safety, product stewardship and [[logistics]], as well as to continuously improve dialog with their neighbors and the public, independent from legal requirements.

As part of Responsible Care initiative, the [[International Council of Chemical Associations]] introduced the Global Product Strategy in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8156">'''Rock mass classification''' systems are used for various engineering design and stability analysis. These are based on empirical relations between rock mass parameters and engineering applications, such as tunnels, slopes, foundations, and excavatability. The first rock mass classification system in [[geotechnical engineering]] was proposed in 1946 for [[tunnel]]s with steel set support.

==Design methods==
In engineering in rock, three design strategies can be distinguished: analytical, empirical, and numerical. Empirical, i.e. rock mass classification, methods are extensively used for feasibility and pre-design studies, and often also for the final design.

==Objectives==
The objectives of rock mass classifications are (after Bieniawski 1989):

# Identify the most significant parameters influencing the behaviour of a rock mass.
# Divide a particular rock mass formulation into groups of similar behaviour – rock mass classes of varying quality.
# Provide a basis of understanding the characteristics of each rock mass class
# Relate the experience of rock conditions at one site to the conditions and experience encountered at others
# Derive quantitative data and guidelines for engineering design
# Provide common basis for communication between engineers and geologists

===Benefits===
The main benefits of rock mass classifications:
# Improving the quality of site investigations by calling for the minimum input data as classification parameters.
# Providing quantitative information for design purposes. 
# Enabling better engineering judgement and more effective communication on a project.
# provide a basis for understanding the characteristics of each rock mass

===Earlier systems===
*Rock load classification method
:The ''Rock load classification method'' is one of the first methodologies for rock mass classification for engineering. [[Karl von Terzaghi]] developed the methodology for tunnels supported by steel sets in the 1940s. By many regarded as obsolete as ideas about rock and rock mass mechanical behavior have since further developed and the methodology is not suitable for modern tunneling methods using [[shotcrete]] and [[rockbolt|rock bolt]]s.

*Stand-up time classification
:The ''Stand-up time classification'' by Lauffer is often regarded as the origin of the ''[[New Austrian Tunnelling Method]]'' ''(NATM)''. The original system as developed by Lauffer is nowadays by many regarded as obsolete but his ideas are incorporated in modern rock mechanics science, such as the relation between the span of a tunnel and the stand-up time, and notably in the [[New Austrian Tunnelling Method]].

 | pages = 46–51
}}

*[[Rock Quality Designation]] 
:The ''[[Rock Quality Designation]]'' index was developed by Deere in the 1960s to classify the quality of a rock core based on the integrety of borehole cores. Nowadays the classification system itself is not very often used, but the determination of the [[RQD]] as index for rock core quality is standard practice in any geotechnical rock drilling, and is used in many, more recent, rock mass classification systems, such as ''RMR'' and ''Q-system'' (see above).

*[[Rock Structure Rating]] (RSR)
:The [[Rock Structure Rating]] system is a quantitative method for describing quality of a rock mass and appropriate ground support, in particular, for steel-rib support, developed by Wickham, Tiedemann and Skinner in the 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2914">The '''short ton''' is a unit of [[mass]] equal to 2,000 [[Pound (mass)|pounds-mass]] (907.18474 [[Kilogram|kg]]). The unit is most commonly used in the United States where it is known simply as the ''ton''.&lt;ref name=NIST44-C&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The '''short ton''' sometimes describes [[force]]. One short-ton contains 2,000 [[Pound (mass)|pounds-mass]], which converted into [[Slug (unit)|slugs]] and multiplied by one [[standard gravity]] applies a [[weight]] of 2,000 [[Pound (force)|pounds-force]] as per [[Newton's Second Law of Motion|Newton's second law of motion]]. 

==United States==
{{anchor|United States}}
In the [[United States]], a short ton is usually known simply as a "ton",&lt;ref name=NIST44-C/&gt; without distinguishing it from the [[tonne]] ({{convert|1000|kg|lb|5|disp=or}}), known there as the "metric ton", or the [[long ton]] also known as the "Imperial ton" ({{convert|2240|lb|kg|7|disp=or}}). There are, however, some U.S. applications where unspecified ''tons'' normally means long tons (for example, naval ships)&lt;ref name=BTS.GOV&gt;
{{cite web
  | url         = http://ntl.bts.gov/DOCS/narmain/narmain.html
  | title       = Naval Architecture for All
  | publisher   = United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics
  | accessdate  = October 13, 2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or metric tons (world grain production figures).

Both the long and short ton are defined as 20 [[hundredweight]]s, but a hundredweight is {{convert|100|lb|kg|6}} in the [[United States customary units|U.S. system]] (short or net hundredweight) and {{convert|112|lb|kg|6}} in the [[Imperial units|imperial system]] (long or gross hundredweight).&lt;ref name=NIST44-C/&gt;

A '''short ton–force''' is {{convert|2000|lb-f|N|9|lk=on}}.

==United Kingdom==
{{Unsourced section|date=February 2017}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], short tons are rarely used.  The word "ton" is taken to refer to a long ton, and metric tons are distinguished by the "tonne" spelling.  Most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries followed British practice with the exception of [[Canada]], which used short tons as well as long tons.  Canada now predominantly uses metric tons (tonnes).

'''Starlite''' is a material claimed to be able to withstand and [[thermal insulation|insulate]] from extreme heat. It was invented by amateur chemist and hairdresser [[Maurice Ward]] (1933&amp;ndash;2011) during the 1970s and 1980s, and received significant publicity after coverage of the material aired in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keene |first1=Jamie |title=Starlite: the miracle material that could be lost forever |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/17/3026074/starlite-maurice-ward-plastic-fireproof |website=The Verge |accessdate=14 October 2018 |date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the science and technology show ''[[Tomorrow's World]]''.

Despite interest from [[NASA]] and other major technological companies, Ward never revealed the composition of Starlite, which is still unknown.  Ward once mentioned that his close family knows the fabrication process, but after his death neither his wife nor any of his four daughters have produced any sample to demonstrate that they know the process.


==Properties==
Under tests, Starlite was claimed to be able to withstand attack by a laser beam that could produce a temperature of 10,000 degrees Celsius. Live demonstrations on ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' and [[BBC Radio 4]] showed that an egg coated in Starlight could remain raw, and cold enough to be picked up with a bare hand, even after five minutes in the flame of a [[blowtorch]]. It would also prevent a blowtorch from damaging a human hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nnLP--uTI |title=Maurice on Tomorrow's World |website=[[YouTube]] |date=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When heat is applied, the material [[Charring|chars]], which creates an expanding low density foam of carbon which is very [[Thermal_resistance|thermally resistant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/reel/playlist/searching-for-starlite?vpid=p06llpln|title=How does Starlite work?|website=BBC Reel|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence]] Sir [[Ronald Mason (chemist)|Ronald Mason]] noted, "Maurice sometimes speaks scientific cobblers, but this is really the most remarkable material".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |title=Soundbites |date=12 Apr 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2016|reason=Unable to find source even though the most newspaper has been digitized during this period.}}

[[Materials scientist]] [[Mark Miodownik]] described Starlite as one of the materials he would most like to see for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Fisher |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428641-700-the-power-of-cool-whatever-became-of-starlite/ |title=The power of cool: Whatever became of Starlite? |magazine=[[New Scientist]] |date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miodownik compares Starlite to paints that have an [[intumescent]] quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/reel/playlist/searching-for-starlite?vpid=p06llrqc What's inside Starlite?] (at 5:15), October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASA]] spokesman Rudi Narangor said of their discussions with Ward, "We have done a lot of evaluation and ...we know all the tremendous possibilities that this material has."&lt;ref name=defying/&gt;

==Commercialisation==
Ward allowed various organisations such as the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] and [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] to conduct tests on samples, but did not permit them to retain samples for fear of [[reverse engineering]]. Ward maintained that his invention was worth billions&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/reel/playlist/searching-for-starlite?vpid=p06llq7w|title=The wonder material that never made it|website=BBC Reel|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he insisted he retain 51% ownership of the formula – a move that may have hindered Starlite's commercialisation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Although Ward claimed discussions with various organisations such as NASA, he was very protective of the composition for fear of losing control of the rights to the material&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (not even letting samples out of his sight). By the time of his death in May 2011, there appeared to have been no commercialisation of Starlite, and the formulation of the material has not been released to the public. According to a 2016 broadcast of the BBC programme ''[[The Naked Scientists]]'', Ward took his secrets with him when he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |url=http://nakeddiscovery.com/downloads/split_podcasts/16.08.02/Naked_Scientists_Show_16.08.02_1005509.mp3 |title=The mystery of Starlite |series=[[The Naked Scientists]] |network=[[BBC]] |date=2 August 2016 |transcript=(Written transcript of audio programme) |transcript-url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/interviews/interview/1001944/ |first=Chris |last=Smith |format=MP3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 an anonymous contributor to ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s [[Notes &amp; Queries]] section said that the main issue was that Starlite came in the form of powder that had to be mixed with [[Polyvinyl acetate]] (PVA) glue to be coated, but that such coating had a very limited lifespan. He also says that "this is the true reason why Mr Ward was never able to sell or bring his incomplete product to market." This contributor also claims that there was at least one other complete and superior product undergoing tests at the time he published his comment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-5575,00.html "Notes &amp; Queries: What happened to 'starlite'..."] Guardian News and Media Limited 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Composition==
Starlite's composition is a closely guarded secret, but it is said to contain a variety of organic polymers and co-polymers with both organic and inorganic additives, including [[borate]]s and small quantities of [[Ceramic|ceramics]] and other special barrier ingredients — up to 21 in all.  Perhaps uniquely for a material claimed to be thermal and blast-proof, it is claimed to be not wholly [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] but up to 90 percent [[Organic compound|organic]].&lt;ref name=defying&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/5158972/Starlite-the-nuclear-blast-defying-plastic-that-could-change-the-world.html |accessdate=18 March 2018|title=Starlite, the nuclear blast-defying plastic that could change the world |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=15 April 2009 |location=London |first=Rose |last=George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Texas Phoenix palm decline''' is a plant disease caused by a [[phytoplasma]], ''Candidatus'' Phytoplasma palmae.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elliott |first=Monica |title=Emerging Palm Diseases in Florida |work=HortTechnology |volume=19 |issue=4 |date=2009 |pp=717-718 |url=http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/19/4/717.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"&gt;{{cite report |last1=Harrison |first1=Nigel A. |first2=Monica L. |last2=Elliot |title=Texas Phoenix Palm Decline |publisher=Plant Pathology Department, UF/IFAS Extension, University of Florida |date=June 2013 |orig-year=2007 |url=https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/PP/PP16300.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes its name from the state it was first identified in and the palm species, ''Phoenix'', upon which it was first identified. It is currently found in parts of [[Florida]] and [[Texas]].

The TPPD strain is classified as group 16SrIV, subgroup D (16SrIV-D) and LY:16SrIV-A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Harrison |first1=Nigel A. |first2=Monica L. |last2=Elliot |title=Lethal Yellowing of Palm |publisher=Plant Pathology Department, UF/IFAS Extension |date=October 2015 |orig-year=2005 |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/PP/PP14600.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LY Harrison"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harrison |first1=N.

Several palms susceptible to the phytoplasma have been documented, including: ''[[Phoenix canariensis]]'', ''[[Phoenix dactylifera]]'', ''[[Phoenix sylvestris]]'', ''[[Phoenix reclinata]]'', ''[[Sabal palmetto]]'', and ''[[Syagrus romanzoffiana]]''. Prior to 2006, [[lethal yellowing]] was the only other strain of [[phytoplasma]] known to attack palm trees in Florida. The introduction of this disease has left the state of Florida struggling to control the potential damage to palm trees in landscapes statewide.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phyto Harrison"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harrison |first1=N. A. |first2=E. E. |last2=Helmick |first3=M.L. |last3=Elliott  |title=First report of a phytoplasma-associated lethal decline of Sabal palmetto in Florida, USA |work=Plant Pathology |volume=58 |issue=4 |date=August 2009 |p=792 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3059.2009.02069.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==
It has been observed to almost exclusively attack the Canary Island palm, but is seen on other species.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Since 2009, Texas Phoenix palm disease is known to severely affect the ''Phoenix spp.'' and ''Sabal spp.'' palm trees: Canary Island date palm, silver or sylvester date palm, Queen palm, Sabal palm, and cabbage palm. All of these trees have been observed to have the same symptoms. The complete host range of this phytoplasma strain is not known.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broschat"&gt;Broschat, Timothy K., Monica L. Elliot, and Ian Maguire. "Texas Phoenix Palm Decline." A Resource for Pests and Diseases of Cultivated Palms. University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS), and the Center for Plant Health Science and Technology (USDA/APHIS/PPQ/CPHST), 1 2010. Web. 23 Oct 2012. http://itp.lucidcentral.org/id/palms/symptoms/Texas_Phoenix_Palm_Decline.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

If the palm tree is mature enough to produce fruit, it will experience two major symptoms. Premature drop of the majority or all of the fruit, within a short time period (about three days), is an obvious symptom. Soon after this, the flowers become necrotic.&lt;ref name="Broschat"/&gt; However, these symptoms can only be observed during flowering and fruiting season, and if the flowers have not been trimmed from the tree.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;

At any palm age, early infection will show discoloration of the [[foliage]], starting at the tips of the oldest leaves. The leaf colors change from the normal green to different shades of reddish-brown, to dark brown.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt; Declining palm trees are characterized by a large number of discolored leaves in the lower and mid-crown region of the tree.&lt;ref name="Phyto Harrison"/&gt;

When about a third of the oldest leaves become discolored, the spear leaf will die, displaying a tan, rather than green color. The spear leaf is the youngest leaf, generally seen in the center of the canopy. In obvious situations, the dead spear life can be seen hanging down or broken off of the canopy. This indicates that the apical meristem is dead and there will be no new leaf production or growth. In most cases, without close examination, the spear leaf will not be easy to find or observe if it is still alive. Occasionally, when the spear leaf dies, some palms experience root rot. This is a major symptom that differentiates TPPD from [[lethal yellowing]], since LY does not experience root decay.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;

== Diagnostics ==
A large issue with controlling this disease is that it is difficult to diagnose. The early symptoms may appear to be the cause of 'over-trimming' of the leaves or nutrient deficiency. The progression of the symptoms is from the inside of the tree, out and are not immediate.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;"Disease Attacking Florida's State Tree." Bartlett Tree Experts (2009): 20. American Forests. Web. 1 Dec. 2012. http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=7854a5d5-6689-40e6-8e02-c10365a0affc%40sessionmgr13&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=28&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of the spear leaf indicates the death of the [[apical meristem]], which is diagnostic for a phytoplasma infection.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;

Since phytoplasmas are not culturable, a molecular test can be done to confirm its presence. A sample must be sent to a local extension office for testing. To acquire a sample, [[boring]] into the trunk must be done with a drill. It is not known how soon the TPPD phytoplasma can be detected from this test, but it is generally not seen in plants without symptoms. Other times, it is not detectable until the spear leaf dies.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;

== Disease cycle ==
The specific disease cycle for TPPD is not known, since the vector is unidentified. Planthoppers, psyllids, or treehoppers are the suspected carriers. For this reason, a general disease cycle of mollicutes by related insect vectors is described as the cycle for TPPD.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;

Phytoplasmas colonize in the phloem tissue of their hosts. This allows the pathogen to spread systemically through the vascular system into new leaves of the plant.&lt;ref name="Agrios"&gt;Agrios, George N. Plant Pathology. 5. London: Elsevier Academic Press, 2005. 689-690. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Since phytoplasmas are not known to survive without their host (plant or insect), the process of the overwintering (unfavorable conditions) stage is unknown. The exact spot in the cycle where the spear leaf dies is not absolute, but it is thought to be early in the disease process.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;

When a healthy insect vector feeds by piercing the vein of a leaf and sucking the phloem sap, the pathogen is ingested into the gut of the insect. Before the infection can be spread from plant to plant, an incubation period is needed for distribution throughout the insect. Once the [[phytoplasma]] is ingested from the plant, it multiplies in the gut of the insect, travels into the hemolymph, then to the salivary glands. Here, in high enough concentrations, the phytoplasma is transmitted into new plants when the insect feeds.&lt;ref name="Agrios"/&gt;

==Environment==
The only area this disease in known to infect is the southern coastal regions of Texas and Florida.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; It is not known how the [[phytoplasma]] reached Florida, but it is likely it was brought over from an unknown insect vector since movement of palms from the Texas coast to Florida is not routine.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; It is not know whether this phytoplasma prefers the climate of these coastal regions or a specific host. As of now,{{When|date=January 2017}} the only hosts known to carry this disease are a range of palm species.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;

To favor development, the area of infection must have a high population of insect vectors (planthoppers, psyllids, or treehoppers) for continuous, successful [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]].&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Agrios"/&gt; Rate of replication depends on the parameter of the [[incubation period]]. Depending on the insect vector and temperature, it could be anywhere between 10 (at 30°) and 45 (at 10°) days. The concentration of phytoplasmas, at the salivary glands of the insect vector after incubation period, also varies transmission. The concentration must meet a certain level before the insect transfers the infection into new plants.&lt;ref name="Agrios"/&gt;

==Management==
There are two main methods of control for Texas Phoenix palm decline: Removal of dead spear leaves of the palm tree and the application of an antibiotic called oxytetracycline HCl (OTC).&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;

If the spear leaf dies, there are healthy leaves beneath them, and the control method of implementing the removal of dead spear leaves is to be used. Unless the removal of these dead spear leaves occurs, this gives a chance for the vector to use these diseased spear leaves and transmit the disease to other nearby susceptible palm trees.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;

If the spear leaf has not yet been killed by TPPD, antibiotics are added to afflicted palm trees by injecting it into the trunk of the tree. These applications have a liquid composition. They are applied either when the plant is expressing symptoms of TPPD or as a source of protecting known susceptible palm species from ever acquiring the disease. This antibiotic cannot be used on just any palm species. It should rather be used only on prone species palm to TPPD. Over the course of four months these antibiotics will be integrated, if used.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;

Future implications that have not been stable in terms of success or effectiveness, but that still hold promise are discovery of resistant strains of palm or control of vector population. These are not used however due to not knowing the complete known palms TPPD effects and the vector not being totally known either.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt;

== Importance ==
Texas Phoenix palm decline is classified as a systemic disease and it is known to rapidly kill its hosts. Although it is dispersed around by vectors, at this time it is still unknown as to which what specific vectors exactly are carrying and spreading this disease.&lt;ref name="TPPD Harrison"/&gt; The palm disease TPPD has no known cure. In response to the disease outbreak in [[Texas]], namely, quarantines have been set up for various counties (Nueces, Hidalgo, Cameron, Willacy, and various portions of Kleberg county as well). Even more drastic measures have been implemented in [[Florida]], as the entire state is under quarantine for Texas Phoenix palm decline.&lt;ref name="DPLD"&gt;{{Cite web | last=Harrison | first=Nigel A. | title=Date Palm Lethal Decline | website=TexasAgriculture.gov | publisher=Texas Department of Agriculture | date=23 October 2012 | url=http://www.texasagriculture.gov/RegulatoryPrograms/PlantQuality/PestandDiseaseAlerts/DatePalmLethalDecline.aspx | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is large concern for the destruction of the Sabal palm. Given its native status to Florida, its loss could suffer severe consequences to the local ecosystem if there is no reliable management soon.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt;
