      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12377">'''Actinorhizal plants'''  are a group of [[angiosperms]] characterized by their ability to form a [[symbiosis]] with the [[nitrogen fixing]] [[actinobacteria]] ''[[Frankia]]''. This association leads to the formation of nitrogen-fixing root nodules.

==Classification==

Actinorhizal plants are [[dicotyledon]]s distributed among three [[angiosperm]] [[Order (biology)|orders]], 8 [[Family (biology)|families]] and 24 [[Genus|genera]]:&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Wall|2000"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wall|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These three orders form a single [[clade]] within the [[Rosids]], which is a sister taxon to the other major nitrogen-fixing order, the [[Fabales]]. All actinorhizal species are trees or shrubs, except for the genus ''[[Datisca]]''.

Many are common plants in temperate regions like [[alder]], [[Myrica|bayberry]], [[Comptonia (plant)|sweetfern]], [[Dryas (plant)|Avens]], [[mountain misery]] and ''[[Coriaria]]''. Some ''[[Elaeagnus]]'' species and [[Sea-buckthorn]]s produce edible fruit. In tropical regions, ''[[Casuarina]]s'' are widely cultivated.

==Distribution and ecology==
[[File:Actinorhizal Plant Distribution.svg|thumb|right|The distribution of actinorhizal plants.]]
Actinorhizal plants are found on all continents except for [[Antarctica]]. Their ability to form nitrogen-fixing nodules confers a selective advantage in poor soils. Most actinorhizal plants are therefore [[pioneer species]] that colonize young soils where available [[nitrogen]] is scarce like [[moraine]]s, volcanic flows or sand dunes.&lt;ref name="Schwintzer 1990"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schwintzer|Tjepkema|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being among the first species to colonize these disturbed environments, actinorhizal shrubs and trees play a critical role, enriching the soil and enabling the establishment of other species in an [[ecological succession]].&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Wall|2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwintzer 1990"/&gt; Actinorhizal plants like alders are also common in the [[riparian forest]].&lt;ref name="Schwintzer 1990"/&gt;

Actinorhizal plants are the major contributors to nitrogen fixation in broad areas of the world, and are particularly important in [[temperate forest]].&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Wall|2000"/&gt; The nitrogen fixation rate measured for some [[alder]] species is as high as 300&amp;nbsp;kg of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ha/year, close to the highest rate reported in [[legumes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zavitovski|Newton|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary origin==

No fossil records are available concerning nodules, but fossil pollen of plants similar to modern actinorhizal species has been found in sediments deposited 87 million years ago. The origin of the symbiotic association remains uncertain. The ability to associate with ''Frankia'' is a [[polyphyletic]] character and has probably evolved independently in different [[clade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benson|Clawson|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, actinorhizal plants and Legumes, the two major nitrogen-fixing groups of plants share a relatively close ancestor, as they are all part of a [[clade]] within the [[rosid]]s which is often called the ''nitrogen-fixing clade''. This ancestor may have developed a "predisposition" to enter into symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria and this led to the independent acquisition of symbiotic abilities by ancestors of the actinorhizal and Legume species. The genetic program used to establish the symbiosis has probably recruited elements of the arbuscular [[mycorrhiza]]l symbioses, a much older and widely distributed symbiotic association between plants and fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kistner|Parniske|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==The symbiotic nodules==

As in legumes, [[root nodule|nodulation]] is favored by nitrogen deprivation and is inhibited by high nitrogen concentrations. Depending on the plant species, two mechanisms of infection have been described: The first is observed in  casuarinas or alders and is called root hair infection. In this case the infection begins with an intracellular infection of a [[root hair]] and is followed by the formation of a primitive symbiotic organ lacking any particular organization, a prenodule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Laplaze|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second mechanism of infection is called intercellular entry and is well described in ''Discaria'' species. In this case bacteria penetrate the root extracellularly, growing between epidermal cells then between cortical cells. Later on ''Frankia'' becomes intracellular but no prenodule is formed. In both cases the infection leads to cell divisions in the pericycle and the formation of a new organ consisting of several lobes anatomically similar to a lateral root. This organ is the actinorhizal nodule also called [[actinorhizae]]. Cortical cells of the nodule are invaded by ''Frankia'' filaments coming from the site of infection or the prenodule. Actinorhizal nodules have generally an indeterminate growth, new cells are therefore continually produced at the apex and successively become infected. Mature cells of the nodule are filled with bacterial filaments that actively fix nitrogen.

Little information is available concerning the mechanisms leading to nodulation. No equivalent of the rhizobial [[Nod factor]]s have been found, but several genes known to participate in the formation and functioning of Legume nodules (coding for heamoglobin and other nodulins)  are also found in actinorhizal plants where they are supposed to play similar roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vessey|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of genetic tools in ''Frankia'' and in actinorhizal species was the main factor explaining such a poor understating of this symbiosis,  but  the recent sequencing of 3 ''Frankia'' genomes &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Normand|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of [[RNAi]] and [[genomic]] tools in actinorhizal species &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hocher|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gherbi|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; should help to a far better understanding in the following years.

Membership is open to all individuals and scientific institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australasian-arachnology.org Official website]&lt;/ref&gt; The Society maintains a large library of reference books and scientific journals housed at [[Queensland Museum]]. The society is informally structured to promote the study of arachnology to amateurs, students, professionals and institutions.

The Society was founded by [[Robert Raven]] in 1979. The first national meeting was held in 1989 as a special symposium of the 17th Annual General Meeting of the Australian Entomological Society in [[Tanunda]], [[South Australia]]. A second meeting was convened on the periphery of the 12th International Congress of Arachnology, held in [[Brisbane]] in July 1992 by the [[International Society of Arachnology]]. Other meetings have included one in [[Canberra]] on the occasion of the  Invertebrate Biodiversity and Conservation Conference in December 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australasian-arachnology.org/history/|title=AAS - Australasian Arachnological Society - History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.australasian-arachnology.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joint participation with the Australian Entomological Society in a conference at [[Hobart]] in 2012.

[[Bipolar transistor]] [[amplifiers]] must be properly [[Biasing (electronics)|biased]] to operate correctly. In circuits made with individual devices (discrete circuits), biasing networks consisting of [[resistor]]s are commonly employed. Much more elaborate biasing arrangements are used in [[integrated circuits]], for example, [[bandgap voltage reference]]s and [[current mirror]]s. The voltage divider configuration achieves the correct voltages by the use of resistors in certain patterns. By selecting the proper resistor values, stable current levels can be achieved that vary only little over temperature and with transistor properties such as [[Bipolar_junction_transistor#Beta| β]].

The [[operating point]] of a device, also known as ''bias point'', ''quiescent point'', or ''Q-point'', is the point on the output characteristics that shows the [[direct current|DC]] collector–emitter voltage (''V''&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt;) and the collector current (''I''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) with no input signal applied.

==Bias circuit requirements==

===Signal requirements for class-A amplifiers===
For analog operation of a [[class-A amplifier]], the Q-point is placed so the transistor stays in '''[[Bipolar junction transistor#Regions of operation|active mode]]''' (does not shift to operation in the saturation region or cut-off region) when input is applied. For digital operation, the Q-point is placed so the transistor does the contrary – switches from the "on" (saturation) to the "off" (cutoff) state. Often, the Q-point is established near the center of the active region of a transistor characteristic to allow similar signal swings in positive and negative directions.

===Thermal considerations===
At constant current, the voltage across the emitter&amp;ndash;base junction ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; of a bipolar transistor  ''decreases'' 2 mV (silicon) and 1.8mV (germanium) for each 1&amp;nbsp;°C rise in temperature (reference being 25&amp;nbsp;°C). By the [[Ebers&amp;ndash;Moll model]], if the base&amp;ndash;emitter voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; is held constant and the temperature rises, the current through the base&amp;ndash;emitter diode ''I''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; will increase, and thus the collector current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; will also increase. Depending on the bias point, the power dissipated in the transistor may also increase, which will further increase its temperature and exacerbate the problem. This deleterious positive feedback results in '''[[thermal runaway]]'''.&lt;ref name=Sedra&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; There are several approaches to mitigate bipolar transistor thermal runaway. For example,
* [[Negative feedback]] can be built into the biasing circuit so that increased collector current leads to decreased base current. Hence, the increasing collector current throttles its source.
* [[Heat sink]]s can be used that carry away extra heat and prevent the base&amp;ndash;emitter temperature from rising.
* The transistor can be biased so that its collector is normally less than half of the power supply voltage, which implies that collector&amp;ndash;emitter power dissipation is at its maximum value. Runaway is then impossible because increasing collector current leads to a decrease in dissipated power; this notion is known as the ''half-voltage principle.''
The circuits below primarily demonstrate the use of negative feedback to prevent thermal runaway.

== Types of bias circuit for class-A amplifiers ==
The following discussion treats five common biasing circuits used with class-A bipolar transistor amplifiers:

# Fixed bias
# Collector-to-base bias
# Fixed bias with emitter resistor
# Voltage divider bias or potential divider
# Emitter bias

=== Fixed bias (base bias) ===
[[Image:Fixed bias.svg|thumb|right|Fixed bias (Base bias)]]

This form of biasing is also called ''base bias or fixed resistance biasing''. In the example image on the right, the single power source (for example, a battery) is used for both collector and base of a transistor, although separate batteries can also be used.

In the given circuit,

:V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;be&lt;/sub&gt;

Therefore,

:I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; − V&lt;sub&gt;be&lt;/sub&gt;)/R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;

For a given transistor, V&lt;sub&gt;be&lt;/sub&gt; does not vary significantly during use. As V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; is of fixed value, on selection of R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, the base current I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is fixed. Therefore, this type is called ''fixed bias'' type of circuit.

Also for given circuit,

:V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt;

Therefore,

:V&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; − I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;

The [[Bipolar junction transistor#Transistor 'alpha' and 'beta'|common-emitter current gain]] of a transistor is an important parameter in circuit design, and is specified on the data sheet for a particular transistor. It is denoted as β on this page.

Because

:I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = βI&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;

we can obtain I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; as well. In this manner, operating point given as (V&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt;,I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) can be set for given transistor.

'''Advantages:'''
* It is simple to shift the operating point anywhere in the active region by merely changing the base resistor (R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;).
* A very small number of components are required.

'''Disadvantages:'''
* The collector current does not remain constant with variation in temperature or power supply voltage. Therefore, the operating point is unstable.
* Changes in V&lt;sub&gt;be&lt;/sub&gt; will change I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and thus cause I&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; to change. This in turn will alter the gain of the stage.
* When the transistor is replaced with another one, considerable change in the value of β can be expected. Due to this change the operating point will shift.
* For small-signal transistors (e.g., not power transistors) with relatively high values of β (i.e., between 100 and 200), this configuration will be prone to [[thermal runaway]]. In particular, the [[Amplifier#Stability factor|stability factor]], which is a measure of the change in collector current with changes in reverse [[saturation current]], is approximately β+1. To ensure [[Amplifier#Stability factor|absolute stability]] of the amplifier, a stability factor of less than 25 is preferred, and so small-signal transistors have large stability factors.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

'''Usage:'''

Due to the above inherent drawbacks, fixed bias is rarely used in linear circuits (i.e., those circuits which use the transistor as a current source). Instead, it is often used in circuits where transistor is used as a switch. However, one application of fixed bias is to achieve crude [[automatic gain control]] in the transistor by feeding the base resistor from a DC signal derived from the AC output of a later stage.

=== Collector feedback bias ===
[[Image:Collector to base bias.svg|thumb|right|Collector-to-base bias]]

This configuration employs [[negative feedback]] to prevent [[thermal runaway]] and stabilize the operating point. In this form of biasing, the base resistor &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{b}}&lt;/math&gt; is connected to the collector instead of connecting it to the DC source &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{cc}}&lt;/math&gt;. So any thermal runaway will induce a voltage drop across the &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{C}}&lt;/math&gt; resistor that will throttle the transistor's base current.

From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]], the voltage &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{R}_{\text{b}}}&lt;/math&gt; across the base resistor &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{b}}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{R}_{\text{b}}} = V_{\text{cc}} \, - \, \mathord{\overbrace{(I_{\text{c}} + I_{\text{b}}) R_{\text{c}}}^{\text{Voltage drop across } R_{\text{c}}}} \, - \, \mathord{\overbrace{V_{\text{be}}}^{\text{Voltage at base}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[Ebers&amp;ndash;Moll model]], &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{c}} = \beta I_{\text{b}}&lt;/math&gt;, and so

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{R}_{\text{b}}} = V_{\text{cc}} - (\overbrace{\beta I_{\text{b}}}^{I_{\text{c}}} + I_{\text{b}}) R_{\text{c}} -  V_{\text{be}} = V_{\text{cc}} - I_{\text{b}} (\beta + 1) R_{\text{c}} -  V_{\text{be}}.&lt;/math&gt;

From [[Ohm's law]], the base current &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{b}} = V_{\text{R}_{\text{b}}} / R_{\text{b}}&lt;/math&gt;, and so

:&lt;math&gt;\overbrace{I_{\text{b}} R_{\text{b}}}^{V_{\text{R}_{\text{b}}}} = V_{\text{cc}} - I_{\text{b}} (\beta + 1) R_{\text{c}} -  V_{\text{be}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the base current &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{b}}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{b}} = \frac{ V_{\text{cc}} - V_{\text{be}} }{ R_{\text{b}} + ( \beta + 1 ) R_{\text{c}} }&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{be}}&lt;/math&gt; is held constant and temperature increases, then the collector current &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{c}}&lt;/math&gt; increases. However, a larger &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{c}}&lt;/math&gt; causes the voltage drop across resistor &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{c}}&lt;/math&gt; to increase, which in turn reduces the voltage &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{R}_{\text{b}}}&lt;/math&gt; across the base resistor &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{b}}&lt;/math&gt;. A lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{b}}&lt;/math&gt;, which results in less collector current &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{c}}&lt;/math&gt;. Because an increase in collector current with temperature is opposed, the operating point is kept stable.

'''Advantages:'''
* Circuit stabilizes the operating point against variations in temperature and β (i.e. replacement of transistor).
* Circuit stabilizes the operating point (as a fraction of &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{cc}}&lt;/math&gt;) against variations in &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{cc}}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Disadvantages:'''
* Although small changes in β are OK, large changes in β will greatly change the operating point. &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{b}}&lt;/math&gt; must be chosen once β is known fairly accurately (perhaps within ~ 25%), yet the variability of β between "identical" parts is often larger than this.
* In this circuit, to keep &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{c}}&lt;/math&gt; independent of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, the following condition must be met:

::&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{c}} = \beta I_{\text{b}} = \frac { \beta (V_{\text{cc}} - V_{\text{be}})}{R_{\text{b}} + R_{\text{c}} + \beta R_{\text{c}}} \approx \frac{(V_{\text{cc}} - V_{\text{be}})}{R_{\text{c}}}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the case when

::&lt;math&gt;\beta R_{\text{c}} \gg R_{\text{b}}.&lt;/math&gt;

*As &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-value is fixed (and generally unknown) for a given transistor, this relation can be satisfied either by keeping &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{c}}&lt;/math&gt; fairly large or making &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{b}}&lt;/math&gt; very low.
** If &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{c}}&lt;/math&gt; is large, a high &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{cc}}&lt;/math&gt; is necessary, which increases cost as well as precautions necessary while handling.
** If &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{b}}&lt;/math&gt; is low, the reverse bias of the collector&amp;ndash;base region is small, which limits the range of collector voltage swing that leaves the transistor in active mode.
* The resistor &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{b}}&lt;/math&gt; causes an [[alternating current|AC]] feedback, reducing the [[voltage gain]] of the amplifier. This undesirable effect is a trade-off for greater [[Q-point]] stability. However, a T (R-C-R) network can be used to reduce the AC feedback, which however poses a heavier load on the collector than the simple feedback resistor. At higher frequencies a R-L feedback network can be used, however, it will introduce peaking into the frequency response at various points.

'''Usage:'''
The negative feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier as seen from the base, which can be advantageous.
Due to the gain reduction from feedback, this biasing form is used only when the trade-off for stability is warranted.

=== Fixed bias with emitter resistor ===
[[Image:Fixed bias with emitter resistor.svg|thumb|right|Fixed bias with emitter resistor]]

The fixed bias circuit is modified by attaching an external resistor to the emitter. This resistor introduces [[negative feedback]] that stabilizes the Q-point. From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]], the voltage across the base resistor is

::&lt;math&gt; V_{R_b} = V_{cc} - I_e R_e - V_{be} &lt;/math&gt;

From [[Ohm's law]], the base current is

::&lt;math&gt;I_b = \frac {V_{R_b}}{R_b} &lt;/math&gt;

The way feedback controls the bias point is as follows. If V&lt;sub&gt;be&lt;/sub&gt; is held constant and temperature increases, emitter current increases.  However, a larger I&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; increases the emitter voltage V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, which in turn reduces the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;Rb&lt;/sub&gt; across the base resistor. A lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current, which results in less collector current because I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = β I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;. Collector current and emitter current are related by I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = α I&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; with α ≈ 1, so the increase in emitter current with temperature is opposed, and the operating point is kept stable.

Similarly, if the transistor is replaced by another, there may be a change in I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; (corresponding to change in β-value, for example). By similar process as above, the change is negated and operating point kept stable.

For the given circuit,

::&lt;math&gt;I_b = \frac { V_{cc} - V_{be} } { R_b + ( \beta+1) R_e }&lt;/math&gt;

'''Advantages:'''

The circuit has the tendency to stabilize operating point against changes in temperature and β-value.

'''Disadvantages:'''

*In this circuit, to keep I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; independent of β the following condition must be met:

::&lt;math&gt;I_C = \beta I_b = \frac { \beta (V_{cc} - V_{be})}{R_b+ ( \beta+1) R_e} \approx \frac {(V_{cc} - V_{be})}{R_e}&lt;/math&gt;

which is approximately the case if

::&lt;math&gt;(\beta + 1)R_e \gg R_b &lt;/math&gt;

*As β-value is fixed for a given transistor, this relation can be satisfied either by keeping R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; very large, or making R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; very low.
** If R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is of large value, high V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; is necessary. This increases cost as well as precautions necessary while handling.
** If Rb is low, a separate low voltage supply should be used in the base circuit. Using two supplies of different voltages is impractical.
*In addition to the above, R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; causes AC feedback which reduces the voltage gain of the amplifier.

'''Usage:'''

The feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier when seen from the base, which can be advantageous. Due to the above disadvantages, this type of biasing circuit is used only with careful consideration of the trade-offs involved.

Collector-Stabilized Biasing

=== Voltage divider biasing or emitter bias ===
[[Image:Voltage divider bias.svg|thumb|right|Voltage divider bias]]

''The voltage divider is formed using external resistors'' R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The voltage across R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forward biases the emitter junction. By proper selection of resistors R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the operating point of the transistor can be made independent of β. In this circuit, the voltage divider holds the base voltage fixed independent of base current provided the divider current is large compared to the base current. However, even with a fixed base voltage, collector current varies with temperature (for example) so an emitter resistor is added to stabilize the Q-point, similar to the above circuits with emitter resistor. The voltage divider configuration achieves the correct voltages by the use of resistors in certain patterns. By manipulating the resistors in certain ways you can achieve more stable current levels without having β value affect it too much.

In this circuit the base voltage is given by:

&lt;math&gt;V_B = \ &lt;/math&gt; voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_2 \ &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= V_{cc} \frac{R_2}{(R_1+R_2)} - I_b \frac{R_1 R_2}{(R_1+R_2)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\approx V_{cc} \frac{R_2}{(R_1+R_2)}&lt;/math&gt; provided &lt;math&gt;I_b &lt;&lt; I_2 = V_b / R_2 \ &lt;/math&gt;.

Also &lt;math&gt;V_B = V_{be} + I_eR_e \ &lt;/math&gt;

For the given circuit,

::&lt;math&gt; I_b =\frac 
{
 \frac 
{V_{cc}}{1+R_1/R_2}
 - V_{be}
}
{( \beta + 1)R_e + R_1 \parallel R_2 } .&lt;/math&gt;

'''Advantages:'''
* Unlike above circuits, only one dc supply is necessary.
* Operating point is almost independent of β variation.
* Operating point stabilized against shift in temperature.

'''Disadvantages:'''
*In this circuit, to keep I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; independent of β the following condition must be met:

::&lt;math&gt;I_c = \beta I_b = \beta \frac 
{ 
 \frac 
{V_{cc}}{1+R_1/R_2}
 - V_{be}
}
{( \beta + 1)R_e + R_1 \parallel R_2 } \approx \frac 
{ \frac {V_{cc}}{1+R_1/R_2}- V_{be}}
{R_e} , &lt;/math&gt;

which is approximately the case if

::&lt;math&gt;( \beta + 1 ) R_e &gt;&gt; R_1 \parallel R_2&lt;/math&gt;

where R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[Series and parallel circuits|equivalent resistance]] of R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; connected in parallel.

*As β-value is fixed for a given transistor, this relation can be satisfied either by keeping R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; fairly large, or making R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; very low.
** If R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is of large value, high V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; is necessary. This increases cost as well as precautions necessary while handling.
** If R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ||  R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is low, either R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is low, or R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is low, or both are low. A low R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; raises Vb closer to V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, reducing the available swing in collector voltage, and limiting how large Rc can be made without driving the transistor out of active mode. A low R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lowers V&lt;sub&gt;be&lt;/sub&gt;, reducing the allowed collector current. Lowering both resistor values draws more current from the power supply and lowers the input resistance of the amplifier as seen from the base.
* AC as well as DC feedback is caused by R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, which reduces the AC voltage gain of the amplifier. A method to avoid AC feedback while retaining DC feedback is discussed below.

'''Usage:'''

The circuit's stability and merits as above make it widely used for linear circuits.

==== Voltage divider with AC bypass capacitor ====
[[Image:Voltage divider with cap.svg|thumb|right|Voltage divider with capacitor]]

The standard voltage divider circuit discussed above faces a drawback – AC feedback caused by resistor R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; reduces the gain. This can be avoided by placing a capacitor (C&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) in parallel with R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, as shown in circuit diagram. The result is that the DC operating point is well controlled, while the AC-gain is much higher (approaching β), rather than the much lower (but predictable) value of &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{c}}/R_{\text{e}}&lt;/math&gt; without the capacitor.

==== Emitter bias ====
[[Image:Emitter bias.PNG|thumb|right|Emitter bias]]

When a split supply (dual power supply) is available, this biasing circuit is the most effective, and provides zero bias voltage at the emitter or collector for load. The negative supply V&lt;sub&gt;ee&lt;/sub&gt; is used to forward-bias the emitter junction through R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;. The positive supply V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; is used to reverse-bias the collector junction. Only two resistors are necessary for the common collector stage and four resistors for the common emitter or common base stage.

We know that,

V&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; − V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;be&lt;/sub&gt;

If R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is small enough, base voltage will be approximately zero. Therefore, emitter current is,

Ie = (V&lt;sub&gt;ee&lt;/sub&gt; − V&lt;sub&gt;be&lt;/sub&gt;)/R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;

The operating point is independent of β if Re &gt;&gt; R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;/β

'''Advantages:'''

'''Disadvantages:'''

This type can only be used when a split (dual) power supply is available.

==Class-B and AB amplifiers==

===Signal requirements===
[[Electronic amplifier#Class B|Class B]] and [[Electronic amplifier#Class AB|AB]] amplifiers employ 2 active devices to cover the complete 360 deg of input signal flow. Each transistor is therefore biased to perform over approximately 180 deg of the input signal. Class B bias is when the collector current I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; with no signal is just conducting (about 1% of maximum possible value). Class-AB bias is when the collector current I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is about 1/4 of maximum possible value.
The class-AB [[push–pull output]] amplifier circuit below could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier. 
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Amplifier Circuit Small.svg|500px|A practical amplifier circuit]]&lt;br&gt;
{{refbegin}}A practical amplifier circuit{{refend}}&lt;/center&gt;

Q3 is a [[common emitter]] stage that provides amplification of the signal and the DC bias current through D1 and D2 to generate a bias voltage for the output devices. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair.  The [[diode]]s D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).

This design automatically stabilizes its operating point, since overall feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond.  The use of fixed diode bias requires the diodes to be both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors. If the output transistors conduct too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.

A common solution to help stabilize the output device operating point is to include some emitter resistors, typically an ohm or so. Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amplifier.

The '''Center for Jewish Studies Shanghai''' (CJSS, Simplified: 上海犹太研究中心, Traditional: 上海猶太研究中心, Pinyin: ''Shànghǎi Yóutài Yánjiūzhōngxīn'') was established in 1988. It is a department of the [[Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences]]. Under the leadership of Dean [[Pan Guang]] CJSS has become the most influential research institute in China studying Judaism and Israeli affairs. 

The Center focuses its research on the history of the "Shanghai Jews" ([[the Holocaust]] refugees during [[World War II]]), the remnants of Jewish communities in China (the largest of which are in [[Tianjin]], [[Harbin]] and [[Kaifeng]]) and political studies on the Near East. Amongst the publications of the Center are ''The Jews of China'', ''The Jewish Civilization'', ''The Revitalization of the Jewish People'' and ''Jews in China: Legends, History and New Perspectives''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311193059/http://www.cjss.org.cn/new_page_7i.htm]

The Center has organized several national as well as international academic conferences along with so-called Rickshaw Reunions (reunions of Holocaust refugees who survived the Holocaust in [[Shanghai#During World War II|Shanghai]]). The Center has been visited by prominent guests, amongst them [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Ehud Olmert]], [[Gerhard Schröder]], [[Ariel Sharon]], [[Hillary Clinton]] and then [[Austria]]n President [[Thomas Klestil]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311045108/http://www.cjss.org.cn/new_page_3.htm]

Since 2006 the CJSS receives each year an [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service|Austrian Holocaust Memorial Servant]] from the [[Austrian Service Abroad]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10057">The '''Clean Air Society of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]''' ('''CASANZ''') is a non-governmental, non-profit organization formed in the 1960s to bring together people with an interest in clean air and the study of [[air pollution]]. Its focus has since grown to include broader [[environmental management]] affairs, but with special emphasis on air quality and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.casanz.org.au/ Official CASANZ website]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2005, the society had 836 members (683 in Australia, 140 in New Zealand, and 13 in other countries). In September 2007, CASANZ hosted the 14th [[International Union of Air Pollution Prevention and Environmental Protection Associations|IUAPPA]] World Congress in Brisbane, Australia.

==Activities promoting environmental protection==
CASANZ promotes the protection of the environment by a variety of activities, including:
*Advancement of knowledge and practical experience of [[Environmentalism|environmental]] and [[air quality]] management. 
*Providing an organization which gathers and distributes the experience and knowledge of its members. 
*Providing lectures, exhibitions, public meetings and conferences that expand knowledge of environmental matters and, in particular,  air quality — including causes, effects, measurement, legislative aspects and control of [[air pollution]]. 
*Liaison with organizations having similar interests in other countries. 
*Providing scholarships, monetary grants, awards and prizes to encourage the study of relevant subjects.

==The operation and governing of CASANZ==
CASANZ operates through autonomous branches which determine their own programs of activities, including technical meetings, seminars, workshops, conferences, training courses, etc. Details of these activities are circulated to branch members and posted on the society's online web site.

CASANZ is governed by an Executive Committee consisting of:
*An elected Executive Director
*Other officers and representatives nominated by the branches.

The Executive Committee manages the day-to-day activities of the society and directs the work of the Executive Director.

==Special Interest Groups (SIGS)==
As of September 2013, CASANZ has eight Special Interest Groups (commonly referred to as SIGs), each of which is briefly discussed in the following subsections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Default.aspx The eight SIGs of CASANZ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614033919/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Default.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modelling Special Interest Group===
The objective of the '''''Modelling Special Interest Group''''' is to bring together CASANZ members who have an interest in the development and/or application of [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= www.crcpress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105075907/http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= |date=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to exchange ideas, identify common problems, inform members of new developments, and establish, as appropriate, a 'ModSIG view' on issues of relevance.

Dispersion modelling is becoming more and more a part of licensing emissions to the atmosphere throughout Australia, and there is growing awareness of the role that air quality modelling can play in areas such as air resource management, [[risk assessment]] and land-use planning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/modelling.aspx The Modelling SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035243/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/modelling.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Odour Special Interest Group===
The '''''[[Odour Special Interest Group]]''''' is an important forum for the exchange of information, and in encouraging improved practices in [[odour]] measurement, modelling, assessment, control, management and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/odour.aspx The Odour SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614031539/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/odour.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor Air Special Interest Group===
The '''''Indoor Air Special Interest Group''''' promotes discussion and debate on the state of knowledge and the quality of indoor air, and on related environmental health concerns. The group encourages research, education, community awareness and management of issues related to this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035113/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/indoorair.aspx The Indoor Air SIG page on the Casanz website].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenhouse Special Interest Group===
The purpose of the '''''Greenhouse Special Interest Group''''' is threefold:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035109/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/greenhouse.aspx The Greenhouse SIG page on the CASANZ website].&lt;/ref&gt;

*To identify the research and development work being done at national and international levels on the science of greenhouse and global climate modelling as well as the developments being undertaken to assess and quantify the impact of climate change.
*To inform CASANZ members and the broader community on greenhouse gas emissions, emission scenarios, regional contributions and economic and technological developments.
*To provide response to government policies and initiatives in the area of energy reform and greenhouse abatement so as to stimulate debate amongst members and the broader community.

===Measurement Special Interest Group===
The primary objective of the '''''Measurement Special Interest Group''''' is to ensure that atmospheric pollutants in the ambient air and industrial source emissions are measured utilising methods that are fit for that purpose.

The objective is to be achieved by: conducting workshops, developing decision trees to assist in selecting appropriate air pollution measurement test methods and developing source emission and ambient air quality test methods in cooperation with Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/measurement.aspx The Measurement SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035227/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/measurement.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport Special Interest Group===
The '''''Transport Emissions and Fuel Consumption Modeling Special Interest Group''''' (or simply the '''''Transport Special Interest Group''''') focuses on the quantification and modelling of air pollutant and greenhouse gas impacts from all forms of transport and their support equipment. The Transport Special Interest Group is intended to be a platform for information sharing, discussion of emerging issues and coordination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Transport/Default.aspx The Transport SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035221/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Transport/Default.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk Assessment Interest Group===
The '''''Risk Assessment Interest Group''''' exists to be knowledgeable and supportive of governmental policy developments involving risk assessment, such as:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035058/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Riskassessment/Default.aspx The Risk Assessment SIG page on the Casanz website].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''National Air Quality Standards (Air NEPM)'' which were developed with the help of risk assessment.
* Variations to the State of Victoria's ''Environment Protection Policy for Air Quality Management'' to incorporate formalised risk assessments. 
* The ''National Environmental Health Strategy'', which includes risk assessment as a basis for decision making.
* The Australian Standard for ''Risk Management (AS4360-1999)''.
* The proposal to develop a coordinated national strategy for ''air toxics''.

===Air Policy Special Interest Group===
The purpose of the '''''Air Policy Special Interest Group''''' is to bring together CASANZ members interested in advancing air policy development and contributing to responsible air quality related risk communication by:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/airpolicy/Default.aspx The Air Policy SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035103/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/airpolicy/Default.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exchanging ideas, and informing members of new air policy related developments and air quality issues of significant public concern.
* Coordinating and communicating science-based inputs for air policy, legislative and regulatory development processes.
* Collating and communicating science-based information to communities and decision makers on pressing air quality related issues, including official inquiries

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10920">'''Computational epistemology''' is a subdiscipline of [[formal epistemology]] that studies the intrinsic complexity of inductive problems for ideal and computationally bounded agents. In short, computational epistemology is to [[inductive reasoning|induction]] what [[recursion theory]] is to [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]].

==Themes==
Some of the themes of computational epistemology include:
*the essential likeness of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] (as illustrated by systematic analogies between their respective [[complexity classes]])
*the treatment of discovery, prediction and assessment methods as [[Effective method|effective procedures]] ([[algorithms]]) as originates in [[algorithmic learning theory]].
*the characterization of inductive inference problems as consisting of:  
#a set of relevant possibilities ([[possible worlds]]), each of which specifies some potentially infinite sequence of inputs to the scientist’s method,  
#a question whose potential answers [[Partition of a set|partition]] the relevant possibilities (in the set theoretic sense),   
#a convergent success criterion and 
#a set of admissible methods  
*the notion of logical reliability for inductive problems

==Quotations==

Computational epistemology definition:
:"Computational epistemology is an interdisciplinary field that concerns itself with the relationships and constraints between reality, measure, data, information, knowledge, and wisdom" (Rugai, 2013)

On making inductive problems easier to solve:
:"Eliminating relevant possibilities, weakening the convergence criterion, coarsening the question, or augmenting the collection of potential strategies all tend to make a problem easier to solve" (Kelly, 2000a)

On the divergence of computational epistemology from [[Bayesian confirmation theory]] and the like:
:"Whenever you are inclined to explain a feature of science in terms of probability and confirmation, take a moment to see how the issue would look in terms of complexity and success"(Kelly, 2000a)

Computational epistemology in a nutshell:
::Formal learning theory is very simple in outline. An inductive problem specifies a range of epistemically possible worlds over which to succeed and determines what sort of output would be correct, where correctness may embody both content and truth (or some analogous virtue like empirical adequacy). Each possible world produces an input stream which the inductive method processes sequentially, generating its own output stream, which may terminate (ending with a mark indicating this fact) or go on forever. A notion of success specifies how the method should converge to a correct output in each possible world. A method solves the problem (in a given sense) [[if and only if|just in case]] the method succeeds (in the appropriate sense) in each of the possible worlds specified by the problem. We say that such a method is reliable since it succeeds over all the epistemically possible worlds. Of two non-solutions, one is as reliable as the other just in case it succeeds in all the worlds the other one succeeds in. That's all there is to it! (Kelly et al. 1997)

On the proper role of methodology:
:"It is for empirical science to investigate the details of the mechanisms whereby we track, and for methodologists to devise and refine even better (inferential) mechanisms and methods" (Nozick, 1981)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6107">[[Image:Dtfeproblem.jpg|thumb|right|The reconstruction of a density field from a discrete set of points sampling this field.]]The '''Delaunay tessellation field estimator (DTFE)''', (or '''Delone tessellation field estimator (DTFE)''') is a mathematical tool for reconstructing a volume-covering and continuous density or intensity field from a discrete point set. The DTFE has various [[Astrophysics|astrophysical]] applications, such as the analysis of  [[Computer simulation|numerical simulations]] of [[Structure formation|cosmic structure formation]], the mapping of the [[large-scale structure of the universe]] and improving computer simulation programs of cosmic structure formation. It has been developed by Willem Schaap and Rien van de Weijgaert. The main advantage of the DTFE is that it automatically adapts to (strong) variations in density and geometry. It is therefore very well suited for studies of the large scale galaxy distribution.

== Method ==

The DTFE consists of three main steps:
[[Image:Dtfe.jpg|thumb|right|Overview of the DTFE procedure.]]

=== Step 1 ===

The starting point is a given discrete point
distribution. In the upper left-hand frame of the figure, a point distribution is plotted in which at the center of the frame an object is located whose density diminishes radially outwards. In the
first step of the DTFE, the [[Delaunay triangulation|Delaunay tessellation]] of the point
distribution is constructed. This is a volume-covering division
of space into triangles (tetrahedra in three dimensions), whose
vertices are formed by the point distribution (see figure, upper right-hand frame). The Delaunay tessellation is defined such
that inside the interior of the circumcircle of each Delaunay triangle 
no other points from the defining point distribution are present.

=== Step 2 ===

The Delaunay tessellation forms the heart of
the DTFE. In the figure it is clearly visible that the tessellation
automatically adapts to both the local density and geometry of the
point distribution: where the density is high, the triangles are small
and vice versa. The size of the triangles is therefore a measure of
the local density of the point distribution.
This property of the Delaunay tessellation is exploited in step 2 of
the DTFE, in which the local density is estimated at the locations of
the sampling points. For this purpose the density is defined at the
location of each sampling point as the inverse of the area of its
surrounding Delaunay triangles (times a normalization constant, see
figure, lower right-hand frame).

=== Step 3 ===

In step 3 these density estimates are interpolated to any other point,
by assuming that inside each Delaunay triangle the density field varies
linearly (see figure, lower left-hand frame).

== Applications ==

=== An atlas of the nearby universe ===

One of the main applications of the DTFE is the rendering of our cosmic neighborhood. 
Below the DTFE reconstruction of the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] is shown, revealing
an impressive view on the cosmic structures in the nearby universe. Several [[supercluster]]s stand out, such as the [[Sloan Great Wall]], the largest structure in the universe known to date.

Image:2dfgrs.png|The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey
Image:2dfdtfe.gif|DTFE reconstruction of the inner parts of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Numerical simulations of structure formation ===

Most algorithms for simulating cosmic structure formation are 
particle hydrodynamics codes. At the core of these codes is the
[[smoothed particle hydrodynamics]] (SPH) density estimation procedure.
Replacing it by the DTFE density estimate will yield a major 
improvement for simulations incorporating feedback processes, 
which play a major role in [[Galaxy formation|galaxy]] and [[star formation]].

=== Cosmic velocity field ===

[[Image:Dtfevelocitypanel.jpg|thumb|right|DTFE velocity field reconstructions of superclusters and voids in the large scale galaxy distribution.]]
The DTFE has been designed for reconstructing density or intensity
fields from a discrete set of irregularly distributed points sampling
this field. However, it can also be used to
reconstruct other continuous fields which have been sampled at the
locations of these points, for example the cosmic velocity field. The use of the DTFE for this purpose has
the same advantages as it has for reconstructing density fields. The
fields are reconstructed locally without the application of an artificial or user-dependent [[smoothing]] procedure, resulting in an optimal [[Image resolution|resolution]] and the suppression of [[shot noise]] effects. The
estimated quantities are volume-covering and allow for a direct
comparison with theoretical predictions.

=== Evolution and dynamics of the cosmic web ===

The DTFE has been specifically designed for describing the
complex properties of the cosmic web. It can therefore be used to study the evolution of voids and superclusters in the large scale matter galaxy distribution.

The '''Emory Law School Supreme Court Advocacy Program''' (ELSSCAP) is an organization at [[Emory Law School]] dedicated to representing clients in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Formed in 2010, the project joined a growing class of [[Supreme Court Clinic]]s that provide expert representation under the guidance of experienced litigators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/rlazarus/docs/articles/Lazarus_YaleLJOnlineFinalPublishedArticle.pdf Docket Capture at the High Court]&lt;/ref&gt; ELSSCAP principally represents clients on petitions for writ of [[certiorari]], in opposition to certiorari, on the merits, or as [[amicus curiae]]. The program was founded by Professor David J. Bederman and Kedar Bhatia, then a first-year law student and now a contributor on [[SCOTUSblog|SCOTUSBlog.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oyez.org/advocates/b/d/david_jeremy_bederman Oyez Profile for David J.

ELSSCAP filed four amicus briefs and two petitions for writ of certiorari in its first year. It has been recognized for its public service efforts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.emory.edu/about-emory-law/news-article/article/supreme-court-advocacy-project-receives-award-for-amicus-brief.html Supreme Court Advocacy Project Receives Award for Amicus Brief] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407014024/http://www.law.emory.edu/about-emory-law/news-article/article/supreme-court-advocacy-project-receives-award-for-amicus-brief.html |date=2012-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and profiled in the National Law Journal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202513674758 Brief of the Week: Student Counsel]&lt;/ref&gt; for an amicus brief&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailywrit.com/blog/uploads/2011/08/10-945_tsac_Medical_Society_of_New_Jersey.pdf Brief of the Medical Society of New Jersey, et al.]&lt;/ref&gt; it filed in [[Florence v.

On October 29, 2012, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in the fourth case taken by the group, Bullock v. BankChampaign N.A.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1518.htm Docket: Bullock v. BankChampaign, N.A.]&lt;/ref&gt;

ELSSCAP is run by an annually elected student Executive Board. The current Director for the 2015-2016 school year is DeWitt Perkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Emory Law School Supreme Court Advocacy Program (ELSSCAP) {{!}} Emory University School of Law {{!}} Atlanta, GA|url = http://law.emory.edu/academics/academic-programs/elsscap.html|website = Emory University School of Law|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other board member positions include Deputy Director, Director of Operations, Director of Case Services, Director of Marketing, Director of Outreach, Director of Membership, Executive Editor, and 1L Representative.

'''Fitts's law''' (often cited as '''Fitts' law''') is a predictive model of human movement primarily used in [[human–computer interaction]] and [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomics]]. This [[scientific law]] predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target.&lt;ref name=Fitts1954&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fitts |first=Paul M. |title=The information capacity of the human motor system in controlling the amplitude of movement |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=47 |number=6 |date=June 1954 |pages=381–391 |doi=10.1037/h0055392 |pmid=13174710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitts's law is used to [[Conceptual model|model]] the act of ''pointing'', either by physically touching an object with a hand or finger, or virtually, by pointing to an object on a [[computer monitor]] using a [[pointing device]].

== Original model formulation ==
The original 1954 paper by [[Paul Fitts|Paul Morris Fitts]] proposed a metric to quantify the difficulty of a target selection task.
The metric was based on 
an information analogy, where the distance to the center of the target (''D'') is like a signal and the tolerance or width of the target (''W'') is like noise.
The metric is Fitts's ''index of difficulty'' (''ID'', in bits):

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{ID} = \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{2D} {W}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

Fitts also proposed an ''index of performance'' (''IP'', in bits per second) as a measure of human performance.  The metric
combines a task's index of difficulty (''ID'') with the movement time (''MT'', in seconds) in selecting the target.  In Fitts's words, 
"The average rate of information generated by a series of movements is the average information per movement divided by the time per movement" (1954, p.&amp;nbsp;390).  Thus,

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{IP} = \Bigg(\frac{\text{ID}} {\text{MT}}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

Today, ''IP'' is more commonly called ''throughput'' (''TP'').  It is also common to include an adjustment for accuracy in the calculation.

Researchers after Fitts began the practice of building linear regression equations and examining the 
correlation (''r'') for goodness of fit.  The equation expresses the relationship between
''MT'' and the ''D'' and ''W'' task parameters:

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{MT} = a + b \cdot \text{ID} = a + b \cdot \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{2D}{W}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*	''MT'' is the average time to complete the movement.
*	''a'' and ''b'' are constants that depend on the choice of input device and are usually determined empirically by [[regression analysis]].
*	''ID'' is the index of difficulty.
*	''D''	is the distance from the starting point to the center of the target. 
*	''W'' is the width of the target measured along the axis of motion.	''W'' can also be thought of as the allowed error tolerance in the final position, since the final point of the motion must fall within ±{{frac|''W''|2}}	of the target's center.

Since shorter movement times are desirable for a given task, the value of the ''b'' parameter can be used as a metric when comparing computer pointing devices against one another. The first [[Human-Computer Interface]] application of Fitts's law was by Card, English, and Burr (1978), who used the index of performance (''IP''), interpreted as {{frac|1|''b''}}, to compare performance of different [[input device]]s, with the [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] coming out on top compared to the joystick or directional movement keys.&lt;ref name=Card1978&gt;{{cite journal |last=Card |first=Stuart K. |first2=William K. |last2=English |first3=Betty J. |last3=Burr |date=1978 |title=Evaluation of mouse, rate-controlled isometric joystick, step keys, and text keys for text selection on a CRT |journal=Ergonomics |volume=21 |number=8 |pages=601–613 |doi=10.1080/00140137808931762|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/SSL-77-1_Evaluation_of_Mouse_Rate-Controlled_Isometric_Joystick_Step_Keys_and_Text_Keys_for_Text_Selection_on_a_CRT.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This early work, according to [[Stuart Card]]'s biography, "was a major factor leading to the mouse's commercial introduction by [[Xerox]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/uir/people/stuart/stuart.htm |title=Stuart Card |website=[[PARC (company)|PARC]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711210730/http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/uir/people/stuart/stuart.htm |archivedate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experiments testing Fitts's law apply the model to a dataset in which either distance or width, but not both, are varied. The model's predictive power deteriorates when both are varied over a significant range.&lt;ref name=Graham1996&gt;{{cite thesis	|last=Graham	|first=Evan	|title=Pointing on a Computer Display	|type=Ph.D.	|publisher=Simon Fraser University	|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notice that because the ''ID'' term depends only on the ''ratio'' of distance to width, the model implies that a target distance and width combination can be re-scaled arbitrarily without affecting movement time, which is impossible. 
Despite its flaws, this form of the model does possess remarkable predictive power across a range of computer interface modalities and motor tasks, and has provided many insights into user interface design principles.

== Bits per second: model innovations driven by information theory ==
The formulation of Fitts's index of difficulty most frequently used in the [[Human-Computer Interaction]] community is called the Shannon formulation:

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{ID} = \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{D}{W}+1\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;	

This form was proposed by Scott MacKenzie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/mack|title=Scott MacKenzie's home page|first=I. Scott|last=MacKenzie|website=www.yorku.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor at [[York University]], and named for its resemblance to the [[Shannon–Hartley theorem]].&lt;ref name=MacKenzie1992&gt;{{cite journal	|last=MacKenzie	|first=I. Scott	|date=1992 |title=Fitts' law as a research and design tool in human–computer interaction |journal=Human–Computer Interaction |volume=7 |pages=91–139 |url=http://www.yorku.ca/mack/hci1992.pdf |format=pdf|doi=10.1207/s15327051hci0701_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this form of the model, the difficulty of a pointing task was equated to a quantity of information transmitted (in units of bits) by performing the task. This was justified by the assertion that pointing reduces to an information processing task. Although no formal mathematical connection was established between Fitts's law and the Shannon-Hartley theorem it was inspired by, the Shannon form of the law has been used extensively, likely due to the appeal of quantifying motor actions using information theory. In 2002 the [[ISO 9241]] was published, providing standards for human-computer interface testing, including the use of the Shannon form of Fitts's law. It has been shown that the information transmitted via serial keystrokes on a keyboard and the information implied by the ''ID'' for such a task are not consistent.&lt;ref name=Soukoreff2011&gt;{{cite journal	|last1=Soukoreff |first1=R. William	|last2=Zhao |first2=Jian |last3=Ren |first3=Xiangshi |title=The Entropy of a Rapid Aimed Movement: Fitts' Index of Difficulty versus Shannon's Entropy	|year=2011 |journal=Human Computer Interaction |pages=222–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adjustment for accuracy: Use of the effective target width ==

An important improvement to Fitts's law was proposed by Crossman in 1956 (see Welford, 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;147–148)&lt;ref name=Welford&gt;{{cite book |last=Welford |first=A. T. |date=1968 |title=Fundamentals of Skill |publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used by Fitts
in his 1964 paper with Peterson.&lt;ref name=Fitts1964&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fitts |first=Paul M. |last2=Peterson |first2=J. R. 
|title=Information capacity of discrete motor responses |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=67 |date=1964 |pages=103–112 |doi=10.1037/h0045689}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the adjustment, target width (''W'') is replaced by an effective target width (''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;).
''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is computed from the standard deviation in the selection coordinates gathered over a sequence of trials for a particular ''D-W'' condition.  If the selections are logged as ''x'' coordinates along the axis of approach to the target, then

:	&lt;math&gt;W_e = 4.133 \times SD_x&lt;/math&gt;

This yields

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{ID}_e = \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{D}{W_e}+1\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

and hence

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{IP} = \Bigg(\frac{ID_e} {MT}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

If the selection coordinates are normally distributed, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; spans 96% of the 
distribution.  If the observed error rate was 4% in the sequence of trials, then ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = ''W''.  If the error rate was greater than 4%, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''W'', and if the error rate was less than 4%, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''W''.  By using ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, a Fitts' law model more closely
reflects what users actually did, rather than what they were asked to do.

The main advantage in computing ''IP'' as above is that spatial variability, or accuracy, is included in the measurement.  
With the adjustment for accuracy, Fitts's law
more truly encompasses the speed-accuracy tradeoff.  The equations above appear in ISO 9241-9 as the recommended method of
computing ''throughput''.

== Welford's model: innovations driven by predictive power ==
Not long after the original model was proposed, a 2-factor variation was proposed under the intuition that target distance and width have separate effects on movement time. Welford's model, proposed in 1968, separated the influence of target distance and width into separate terms, and provided improved predictive power:&lt;ref name="Welford"/&gt;

:	&lt;math&gt;T = a + b_1 \log_2 (D) + b_2 \log_2 (W)&lt;/math&gt;

This model has an additional parameter, so its predictive accuracy cannot be directly compared with 1-factor forms of Fitts's law. However, a variation on Welford's model inspired by the Shannon formulation,

:	&lt;math&gt;T = a + b_1 \log_2 (D+W) + b_2 \log_2 (W) = a + b\log_2 \left(\frac{D+W}{W^k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

reduces to the Shannon form when ''k = 1''. Therefore, this model ''can'' be directly compared against the Shannon form of Fitts's law using the [[F-test]] of nested models.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker_2012&gt;{{cite journal	|last=Shoemaker	|first=Garth	|last2=Tsukitani	|first2=Takayuki	|last3=Kitamura	|first3=Yoshifumi	|last4=Booth	|first4=Kellogg	|title=Two-Part Models Capture the Impact of Gain on Pointing Performance	|journal=ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction	|date=December 2012	|volume=19|issue=4|pages=1–34|doi=10.1145/2395131.2395135}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison reveals that not only does the Shannon form of Welford's model better predict movement times, but it is also more robust when control-display gain (the ratio between e.g. hand movement and cursor movement) is varied. Consequently, although the Shannon model is slightly more complex and less intuitive, it is empirically the best model to use for virtual pointing tasks.

== Extending the model from 1D to 2D and other nuances ==

=== Extensions to two or more dimensions ===
In its original form, Fitts's law is meant to apply only to one-dimensional tasks. However, the original experiments required subjects to move a stylus (in three dimensions) between two metal plates on a table, termed the reciprocal tapping task. The target width perpendicular to the direction of movement was very wide to avoid it having a significant influence on performance. A major application for Fitts's law is 2D virtual pointing tasks on computer screens, in which targets have bounded sizes in both dimensions.

Fitts's law has been extended to two-dimensional tasks in two different ways. For navigating e.g. hierarchical pull-down menus, the user must generate a trajectory with the pointing device that is constrained by the menu geometry; for this application the [[Accot-Zhai steering law]] was derived.

For simply pointing to targets in a two-dimensional space, the model generally holds as-is but requires adjustments to capture target geometry and quantify targeting errors in a logically consistent way.&lt;ref name=Wobbrock2011&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wobbrock |first=J. |last2=Shinohara |first2=K |date=2011 |title=The effects of task dimensionality, endpoint deviation, throughput calculation, and experiment design on pointing measures and models. |journal=Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems |pages=1639–1648 |location=Vancouver, British Columbia |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1979181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacKenzie1992-2D&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacKenzie |first=I. Scott |first2=William A. S. |last2=Buxton |date=1992 |title=Extending Fitts' law to two-dimensional tasks |journal=Proceedings of the ACM CHI 1992 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems |pages=219–226 |url=http://www.yorku.ca/mack/CHI92.html |doi=10.1145/142750.142794 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characterizing performance ===
Since the ''a'' and ''b'' parameters should capture movement times over a potentially wide range of task geometries, they can serve as a performance metric for a given interface. In doing so, it is necessary to separate variation between users from variation between interfaces. 
The ''a'' parameter is typically positive and close to zero, and sometimes ignored in characterizing average performance. Multiple methods exist for identifying parameters from experimental data, and the choice of method is the subject of heated debate, since method variation can result in parameter differences that overwhelm underlying performance differences.&lt;ref name=Soukoreff2004&gt;{{cite journal |title=Towards a standard for pointing device evaluation, perspectives on 27 years of Fitts' law research in HCI |first1=R. William |last1=Soukoreff |first2=I. Scott |last2=MacKenzie |journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies |year=2004 |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=751–789 |url=http://www.yorku.ca/mack/ijhcs2004.html |doi=10.1016/j.ijhcs.2004.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhai2002&gt;{{cite techreport |last=Zhai |first=Shumin |date=2002 |title=On the Validity of Throughput as a Characteristic of Computer Input |number=RJ 10253 |institution=Almaden Research Center |location=San Jose, California |url=http://www.m.shuminzhai.com/papers/ZhaiIBMReporRJ10253.pdf |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional issue in characterizing performance is incorporating success rate: an aggressive user can achieve shorter movement times at the cost of experimental trials in which the target is missed. If the latter are not incorporated into the model, then average movement times can be artificially decreased.

== Temporal targets ==
Fitts's law deals only with targets defined in space. However, a target can be defined purely on the time axis, which is called a temporal target. A blinking target or a target moving toward a selection area are examples of temporal targets. Similar to space, the distance to the target (i.e., temporal distance D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) and the width of the target (i.e., temporal width W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) can be defined for temporal targets as well. The temporal distance is the amount of time a person must wait for a target to appear. The temporal width is a short duration from the moment the target appears until it disappears. For example, for a blinking target, D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; can be thought of as the period of blinking and W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; as the duration of the blinking. As with targets in space, the larger the D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; or the smaller the W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, the more difficult it becomes to select the target.

The task of selecting the temporal target is called temporal pointing. The model for temporal pointing was first presented to [[Human–computer interaction|Human-computer Interaction]] field in 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Byungjoo|last2=Oulasvirta|first2=Antti|date=2016|title=Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2858036.2858143|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '16|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1857–1868|doi=10.1145/2858036.2858143|isbn=9781450333627}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The model predicts the error rate, the human performance in temporal pointing, as a function of temporal index of difficulty (ID&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;):

&lt;math&gt;\text{ID}_{t} = \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{D_{t}}{W_{t}}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

{{See also|Baroque painting}}

'''Flemish Baroque painting''' refers to the art produced in the [[Southern Netherlands]] during Spanish control in the 16th and 17th centuries. The period roughly begins when the [[Dutch Republic]] was split from the [[Habsburg Spain]] regions to the south with the Spanish recapturing of [[Antwerp]] in 1585 and goes until about 1700, when Habsburg authority ended with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1"&gt;Vleighe, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Antwerp, home to the prominent artists [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], and [[Jacob Jordaens]], was the artistic nexus, while other notable cities include [[Brussels]] and [[Ghent]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt;

Rubens, in particular, had a strong influence on seventeenth-century visual culture. His innovations helped define Antwerp as one of Europe's major artistic cities, especially for [[Counter Reformation]] imagery, and his student Van Dyck was instrumental in establishing new directions in English portraiture. Other developments in Flemish [[Baroque]] painting are similar to those found in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]],&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt; with artists specializing in such areas as [[history painting]], [[portrait painting|portraiture]], [[genre painting]], [[landscape painting]], and [[still life]].
{{History of Dutch and Flemish painting}}

==General characteristics==
"Flemish", in the context of this and artistic periods such as the "Flemish Primitives" (in English now [[Early Netherlandish painting]]), often includes the regions not associated with modern [[Flanders]], including the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the autonomous [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt; By the seventeenth century, however, Antwerp was the main city for innovative artistic production, largely due to the presence of Rubens. Brussels was important as the location of the court, attracting [[David Teniers the Younger]] later in the century.

[[File:Frans Hogenberg Bildersturm 1566.jpg|thumb|left|Frans Hogenberg, The Calvinist [[beeldenstorm|Iconoclastic Riot of August 20, 1566]] when many paintings and church decorations were destroyed and subsequently replaced by late [[Northern Mannerist]] and Baroque artists.]]

===Late Mannerism===
Although paintings produced at the end of the 16th century belong to general [[Northern Mannerist]] and Late [[Renaissance]] approaches that were common throughout Europe, artists such as [[Otto van Veen]], [[Adam van Noort]], [[Marten de Vos]], and the [[Francken]] family were particularly instrumental in setting the stage for the local Baroque. Between 1585 and the early 17th century they made many new [[altarpiece]]s to replace those destroyed during the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] [[beeldenstorm|outbreaks of 1566]]. Also during this time [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] became important for their small [[cabinet painting]]s, often depicting [[Mythology|mythological]] and history subjects.

==="The Age of Rubens"===
[[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1577–1640), a student of both Otto van Veen and Adam van Noort, spent eight years in Italy (1600–1608), during which time he studied examples of [[classical antiquity]], the [[Italian Renaissance]], and contemporaries [[Adam Elsheimer]] and [[Caravaggio]]. Following his return to Antwerp he set up an important studio, training students such as Anthony van Dyck, and generally exerting a strong influence on the direction of Flemish art. Most artists active in the city during the first half of the 17th century were directly influenced by Rubens.

[[File:Rubens - Prometheus Bound.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Peter Paul Rubens and Frans Snyders, ''Prometheus Bound'', 1611-12. Philadelphia Museum of Art. This painting is Flemish Baroque example of collaboration and specialization. Snyders, who specialized in animals, painted the eagle while Rubens painted the figure of Prometheus.]]

===Specializations and collaborations===
Flemish art is notable for the large amount of collaboration that took place between independent masters, which was partly related to the local tendency to specialize in a particular area. [[Frans Snyders]], for example, was an animal painter and Jan Brueghel the Elder was admired for his landscapes and paintings of plants. Both artists worked with Rubens, who often usually painted the figures, and other artists to create collaborative pieces.

[[File:Frans Francken d. J. 009.jpg|thumb|left|Frans Francken the Younger, ''Preziosenwand'' (''Wall of Treasures''), 1636. Kunsthistorischesmuseum, Vienna. This type of painting was one of the distinctly Flemish innovations that developed during the early 17th century.]]

===Innovations===
Flower [[still life]] painting, which developed around 1600 by artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, was partially a Flemish innovation,&lt;ref name="vlieghe207"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 207–212.&lt;/ref&gt; echoed in the Dutch Republic in the works of the Antwerp-born [[Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder]] (1573–1621).&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In Antwerp, however, this new genre also developed into a specifically [[Catholic]] type of painting, the [[flower garland]]. Other types of paintings closely associated with Flemish Baroque include the monumental hunting scenes by Rubens and Snyders, and [[gallery paintings]] by artists such as [[Willem van Haecht]] and [[David Teniers the Younger]].

==History painting==
History painting, which includes biblical, mythological and historical subjects, was considered by seventeenth-century theoreticians as the most noble art. [[Abraham Janssens]] was an important history painter in Antwerp between 1600 and 1620, although after 1609 Rubens was the leading figure. Both Van Dyck and [[Jacob Jordaens]] were active painting monumental history scenes. Following Rubens's death, Jordaens became the most important Flemish painter. Other notable artists working in the idiom of Rubens include [[Gaspar de Crayer]], who was active in Brussels, [[Artus Wolffort]], [[Cornelis de Vos]], [[Jan Cossiers]], [[Theodoor van Thulden]], [[Abraham van Diepenbeeck]], and [[Jan Boeckhorst]]. During the second half of the century, history painters combined a local influence from Rubens with knowledge of [[classicism]] and Italian [[Baroque]] qualities. Artists in the vein include [[Erasmus Quellinus the Younger]], [[Jan van den Hoecke]], [[Pieter van Lint]], [[Cornelis Schut]], and [[Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert]]. Later in the century, many painters turned to Anthony van Dyck as a major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were [[Pieter Thijs]], [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]], and artists who were also inspired by Late Baroque theatricality such as [[Theodoor Boeyermans]] and [[Jan-Erasmus Quellinus]]. Additionally, a Flemish variant of ''[[Caravaggism]]'' was expressed by [[Theodoor Rombouts]] and [[Gerard Seghers]].

==Religious painting==
Rubens is closely associated with the development of the Baroque [[altarpiece]]. Painted for the Arquebusiers' [[guild]], the ''[[Descent from the Cross]]'' [[triptych]] (1611–14; [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp]])—with side wings depicting the ''[[Visitation (Christian)|Visitation]]'' and ''[[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Presentation in the Temple]]'', and exterior panels showing ''[[St. Christopher]] and the Hermit''—is an important reflection of Counter-Reformation ideas about art combined with Baroque naturalism, dynamism and monumentality.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 113–121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger de Piles]] explains that "the painter has entered so fully into the expression of his subject that the sight of this work has the power to touch a hardened soul and cause it to experience the sufferings endured by Jesus Christ in order to redeem it."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Baroque'', pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles I of England.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Anthony van Dyck, ''Portrait of King Charles I'', 1635. Louvre, Paris.]]

==Portraiture==
Although not predominately a portrait painter, Rubens's contributions include early works such as his ''Portrait of Brigida Spinola-Doria'' (1606, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]), paintings of his wives (the ''[[Honeysuckle Bower]]'' and ''[[Het Pelsken]]''), and numerous portraits of friends and nobility. He also exerted a strong influence on Baroque portraiture through his student [[Anthony van Dyck]]. Van Dyck became court painter for [[Charles I of England]] and was influential on subsequent English portraiture. Other successful portraitists include [[Cornelis de Vos]] and [[Jacob Jordaens]]. Although most Flemish portraiture is life-sized or monumental, [[Gonzales Coques]] and [[Gillis van Tilborch]] specialized in small-scale group portraiture.
[[File:Adriaen Brouwer - The Bitter Potion - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Adriaen Brouwer, ''The Bitter Drink'', ''c''. 1630–1640. Brouwer's expressive peasants are typical of "low-life" genre painting.]]

==Genre painting==
[[Genre painting]]s, or scenes of everyday life, are common in the 17th century. Many artists follow the tradition of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] in depicting "low-life" peasant themes, although elegant "high-life" subjects featuring fashionably-dressed couples at [[Ball (dance)|balls]] or in gardens of love are also common. [[Adriaen Brouwer]], whose small paintings often show peasants fighting and drinking, was particularly influential on subsequent artists. Images of woman performing household tasks, popularized in the northern Netherlands by [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Jan Vermeer]], is not a significant subject in the south, although artists such as [[Jan Siberechts]] explored these themes to some degree.

===Bruegel tradition===
Flemish genre painting is strongly tied to the traditions of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and was a style that continued directly into the 17th century through copies and new compositions made by his sons [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]]. Many of these are [[Kermesse (festival)|kermis]] paintings and scenes of peasants taking part in other outdoor enjoyments viewed from an elevated viewpoint. Artists in the Dutch Republic, such as the Flemish-born [[David Vinckboons]] and [[Roelandt Savery]], also made similar works, popularizing rustic scenes of everyday life closely associated with Dutch and Flemish painting.

===Adriaen Brouwer and his followers===
[[Adriaen Brouwer]] (1605 or 1606–1638) typically painted small scenes of ragged peasants fighting, gaming, drinking and generally expressing exaggerated and rude behaviour. Born in the Southern Netherlands, Brouwer spent the 1620s in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Haarlem]], where he came under the influence of [[Frans Hals|Frans]] and [[Dirk Hals]] and other artists working in a loose [[painterly]] manner. Upon his return to Antwerp around 1631 or 1632 he introduced a new, influential format in which the subjects were painted as interior, instead of exterior, scenes. He also painted expressive facial studies like ''The Bitter Drink'' (illustrated), a genre called [[tronie]]s ("faces"). Brouwer's art was recognized in his own lifetime and had a powerful impact on Flemish art. Rubens owned more works by him at the time of his death than any other painter, and artists such as [[David Teniers the Younger]], [[Jan van de Venne]], [[Joos van Craesbeeck]] and [[David Ryckaert III]] continued to work in a similar manner.

===Elegant company scenes===
Paintings of elegant couples in the latest fashions, often with underlying themes of love or the [[sense|five senses]], were commonly painted by [[Hieronymus Francken II|Hieronymus Francken the Younger]], [[Louis de Caullery]], [[Simon de Vos]], [[David Teniers the Younger]] and [[David Ryckaert III]]. Rubens's ''Garden of Love'' (''c''. 1634–5; [[Prado Museum]]) belongs to these traditions.

===Monumental genre scenes===
Whereas elegant company scenes and works by Brouwer and his followers were often small in scale, other artists looked to [[Caravaggio]] for inspiration and painted large-scale, theatrically inspired scenes in which musicians, cardplayers, and fortune tellers are pushed to the foreground of the composition. These paintings, like others by ''[[Caravaggism|Caravaggisti]]'', are generally illuminated by strong lighting effects. [[Adam de Coster]], [[Gerard Seghers]] and [[Theodoor Rombouts]] were the main exponents of this popular style in the early 17th century, which was popularized by Italian followers of Caravaggio like [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]] and [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]] like [[Gerrit van Honthorst]]. Rombouts was also influenced by his teacher [[Abraham Janssens]], who began incorporating Caravaggesque influences into his history paintings from first decade of the 17th century

[[File:Jakob Jordaens 001.jpg|thumb|left|Jacob Jordaens, ''The King Drinks''. Jordeans was well known for his large paintings of moralistic genre scenes, such as this depiction of an [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] feast.]]

===Jacob Jordaens===
Jacob Jordaens, who became Antwerp's most important artist after Rubens's death in 1640, is well known for his monumental genre paintings of subjects such as ''The King Drinks'' and ''As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young''. Many of these paintings use compositional and lighting influences similar to those of the ''Caravaggisti'', while the treatment of the subjects inspired Dutch artists like [[Jan Steen]].

===Battle scenes===
Another popular type of painting invented in the [[Low Countries]] was landscapes with historical and fictional battles, as well as skirmishes and robberies. [[Sebastiaen Vrancx]] and his pupil [[Peter Snayers]] specialized in this genre, and Snayer's student [[Adam-Frans van der Meulen]] continued painting them in Antwerp, Brussels and [[Paris]] until the end of the century.

===Bamboccianti===
Following a time-honoured tradition, many northern artists travelled to Italy in the 17th century. Flemish artists such as [[Jan Miel]] (1599–1664), [[Michael Sweerts]] (1618–1664), [[Anton Goubau]] (1616–1698) and [[Willem Reuter]] (c.1642–1681) went to Rome where they worked for a period of time.  Here they were influenced by the works of the [[Genre works|genre painters]] active in Rome referred to as the [[Bamboccianti]].  The Bamboccianti comprised mostly [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Flemings|Flemish]] artists who had brought existing traditions of depicting peasant subjects from [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|sixteenth-century Netherlandish art]] with them to Italy,&lt;ref name=lev&gt;Levine, David A. (December 1988). "The Roman Limekilns of the Bamboccianti". The Art Bulletin. College Art Association. 70 (4), p. 570&lt;/ref&gt; and generally created small [[cabinet painting]]s or [[etching]]s of the [[everyday life]] of the lower classes in Rome and its countryside.&lt;ref name="haskell"&gt;Haskell, Francis (1993). "Chapter 8". Patrons and Painters: Art and Society in Baroque Italy. Yale University Press, pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] who was nicknamed  "Il Bamboccio" (meaning "ugly doll" or "puppet" in Italian) had started this type of genre painting in Rome.  In general, genre painting was not well-accepted in Italy, especially by official organizations such as the [[Academy of St. Luke]].  Many of the painters were alsom members of the [[Bentvueghels]], the society of mainly Flemish and Dutch artists working in Rome. It acted as a support network for Netherlandish artists in Rome who were in need but is better-known for the "[[bohemian]]" lifestyle of its members and drunken festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, David A., "The Bentvueghels: 'Bande Académique"," in IL60: Essays Honoring Irving Lavin on his Sixtieth Birthday, ed. Marilyn Aronberg Lavin. New York: Italica Press, 1990, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape and seascape==

===Early landscape painting===
[[Gillis van Coninxloo]] was an innovative landscape painter in Antwerp in the late 16th century, who introduced a more natural view instead of the traditional [[world landscape]] popularized by earlier painters such as [[Joachim Patiner]]. He left a strong influence on northern landscape painting in general through his period in [[Amsterdam]] and as a founding member of the [[Frankenthal School]]. Forest and mountain landscapes were painted by [[Abraham Govaerts]], [[Alexander Keirincx]], [[Gijsbrecht Leytens]], [[Tobias Verhaecht]] and [[Joos de Momper]]. [[Paul Bril]] settled in Rome, where he specialized as a landscape painter decorating Roman villas and creating small [[cabinet painting]]s.
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - A View of Het Steen in the Early Morning.jpg|thumb|left|Peter Paul Rubens, ''Landscape with view of 'Het Steen''', 1636.]]

===Rubens and later painters===
[[Jan Wildens]] and [[Lucas van Uden]] painted natural landscapes inspired by Rubens, and frequently collaborated with figure painters or animal specialists to paint the backgrounds. Rubens turned to landscape painting in the 1630s, focusing on the area around his chateau, Het Steen. A well-known example is the ''Landscape with a view of 'Het Steen''' ([[National Gallery of London]]).

===Marine painting===
Small seascapes (''zeekens'') were another popular theme. Artists such as [[Bonaventura Peeters]] painted shipwrecks and atmospheric views of ships at sea, as well as imaginary views of exotic ports. [[Hendrik van Minderhout]], who was from [[Rotterdam]] and settled in Antwerp, continued this latter theme contemporaneous with developments of [[marine painting]] in the Dutch Republic.

==Architectural painting==
{{main|Architectural painting}}
Interior architectural views, usually of churches, developed out of the late sixteenth-century works of [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]]. Many were actual locations. [[Pieter Neeffs I]], for example, made numerous interiors of the [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp]]. [[Hendrik van Steenwijk II]], on the other hand, followed Vredeman's precedent in painting imaginary interiors. The genre continued in the later seventeenth century by [[Anton Ghering]] and [[Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg]], but the Flemish examples do not demonstrate the same level of innovation found in the Dutch perspectives of [[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]] or [[Emanuel de Witte]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe200"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 200–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teniers documented the archduke's collection of paintings in this work while he was court painter in Brussels.]]

==Gallery and art collection painting==
Gallery paintings appeared in Antwerp around 1610, and developed—like architectural interiors—from the compositions of [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest innovators of this new genre was [[Frans Francken the Younger]], who introduced the type of work known as the ''Preziosenwand'' (wall of treasures). In these, prints, paintings, sculptures, drawings, as well as collectable objects from the natural world like shells and flowers are collected together in the foreground against a wall that imitates encyclopedic [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]]. A similar variation of these collections of artistic wealth are the series of the [[sense|five senses]] created by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and Rubens ([[Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]]). [[Willem van Haecht]] (1593–1637) developed another variation in which illustrations of actual artworks are displayed in a fantasy art gallery, while connoisseurs and art lovers admire them. Later in the century, [[David Teniers the Younger]], working in the capacity of court painter to [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]], documented the archduke's collection of Italian paintings in Brussels as gallery painters as well as in a printed catalogue–the ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]''. Flemish Gallery and art collection paintings have been interpreted as a kind of visual theory of art.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 202–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Such paintings continued to be made in Antwerp by [[Gerard Thomas]] (1663–1721) and [[Balthasar van den Bossche]] (1681–1715), and foreshadow the development of the [[veduta]] in Italy and the galleries of [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]].

[[File:Jan Brueghel the Elder - Flowers in a Wooden Vessel - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jan Brueghel the Elder, ''Flower Still Life'', 1606/7. Brueghel was an innovator of the flower still life genre.]]

==Still life and animal painting==

===Flower painting===
[[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] was one of the important innovators of the floral still life around 1600.&lt;ref name="vlieghe207"/&gt; These paintings, which presented immaculately observed arrangements and compositions, were imaginary creations of  flowers that bloom at different times of the years.&lt;ref name="vlieghe207" /&gt; They were popular with leading patrons and nobility across Europe, and generally have an underlying [[Vanitas]] motif. The compositions of Brueghel's paintings were also influential on later Dutch flower pieces.&lt;ref name="vlieghe208"&gt;Vlieghe, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Brueghel's sons [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]] and [[Ambrosius Brueghel]] were also flower specialists. [[Osias Beert]] (1580–1624) was another flower painter at the beginning of the 17th century. His paintings share many similarities with northern contemporaries such as [[Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe208" /&gt;

===Garland painting===
Closely related to the flower still life is the flower garland genre of painting that was invented by Jan Brueghel in collaboration with [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[Federico Borromeo]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;David Freedberg, "The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion", ''Münchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst'', xxxii, 1981, pp. 115–150.&lt;/ref&gt; The early versions of these paintings, such as the collaboration by Breughel and Rubens in Munich ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]) show the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[Christ]] child surrounded by a garland of flowers. They have been interpreted as distinctly Counter Reformation images, with the flowers emphasizing the delicacy of the Virgin and Child–images of which were destroyed in large numbers during the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] outbreaks of 1566.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg (1981), ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Brueghel's student, the [[Jesuit]] painter [[Daniel Seghers]], also painted many of these types of works for an international clientele.&lt;ref name="vlieghe209"&gt;Vlieghe, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; In later versions, the fleshy Madonna and Child gave way to sculptural niches and even pagan themes.
[[File:Osias Beert - Oysters 1610.jpg|thumb|right|Osias Beert, ''Still life with oysters'', ''c''. 1610. Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart. Beert's still lifes are typical of the "breakfast" type painted early in the 17th century.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;]]

===Breakfast and banquet still life===
The ''ontbijtje'', or "little breakfast", is a type of still life that was popular in both the northern and southern Netherlands showing a variety of eating and drinking vessels and foods such as cheese and bread against a neutral background. [[Osias Beert]], [[Clara Peeters]], [[Cornelis Mahu]] and [[Jacob Foppens van Es]] (''c''. 1596–1666) were all artists who made these types of painting. More elaborate are the ''pronk'', or "sumptuous", still life. This style developed in the Dutch Republic, and was brought to Antwerp by [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]]. They show, on a larger scale than earlier works, complex compositions of expensive items, rare foods, and fleshy, peeling fruit. These paintings are related to [[vanitas]] and transience motifs.

[[File:Frans SNYDERS, The Pantry.JPG|thumb|left|Frans Snyders, ''The Pantry'', ''c''. 1620.]]

===Animal still life===
[[Frans Snyders]] (1579–1657) painted large still lifes focusing on dead game and animals. His compositions, along with those of his follower [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] (1599–1652). look back to the sixteenth-century paintings of [[Pieter Aertsen]] and [[Joachim Beuckelaer]], but instill that tradition with a High Baroque monumentality.&lt;ref name="vlieghe211"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 211–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent artists, [[Jan Fyt]] and [[Pieter Boel]] further elaborated on this type by including a noticeable mixture of living animals and dead game. These latter paintings are closely related to images of the hunt, which came into fashion in Flemish painting during the 17th century.

==Hunting scenes==
Rubens introduced the monumental hunt to Flemish art, depicting on a large scale a close battle inspired by his study of classical antiquity and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]''. These works show both noble hunts, such as the ''Wolf and Fox Hunt'' ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]), and exotic hunts, such as the ''Lion Hunt'' ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]). [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Paul de Vos]] created similarly large paintings which are 
distinct from Rubens's works in their focus on the animals and absence of human participation.

==Cabinet painting==
Small, intricate paintings, usually depicting history and biblical subjects, were produced in great numbers in the Southern Netherlands throughout the 17th century. Many were created by anonymous artists, however artists such as [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[Hendrik van Balen]], [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and [[Hendrik de Clerck]] were all successful [[cabinet painting|cabinet painters]] during the first half of the 17th century. These artists, as well as followers of [[Adam Elsheimer]] like [[David Teniers the Elder]], remained partly shaped by continued mannerist stylistic tendencies. However, Rubens influenced a number of later artists who incorporated his Baroque style into the small context of these works. Among them are [[Frans Wouters]], [[Jan Thomas van Ieperen]], [[Simon de Vos]], [[Pieter van Lint]], and [[Willem van Herp]]. These small paintings were traded widely throughout Europe, and by way of Spain to [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 105–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FuseNet''' is an organization that unites, coordinates and sponsors European educational efforts in the field of [[nuclear fusion]] in order to increase, enhance, and broaden fusion training and education activities in [[Europe]].

== The FP7 Project ==
The FuseNet project exists of the establishment of a European Fusion Education Network (FuseNet) for education in fusion science and technology. The purpose of FuseNet is to coordinate and facilitate fusion education, to share best practices, to jointly develop educational tools, to organize educational events. The members of FuseNet have jointly established academic criteria for the award of European Fusion Doctorate and Master Certificates. These criteria are set to stimulate a high level of fusion education throughout Europe.

The FuseNet project started in October 2008 as a Coordination and Support Action under the [[seventh Framework Programme]], with financial support of the [[European Commission]]. The project consists of eleven focused work packages, with a total budget of 2 Million Euro. The project runs until October 1, 2013 and is bringing together a broad representation from the European fusion community with 36 participants from 18 countries, of which 22 Universities and 14 Euratom Associations.

The project consists of four groups of coordination actions: the establishment and running of the FuseNet network; development of individual learning opportunities and common educational goals; development of educational materials and hands-on experiments; and funding of joint educational activities.

== The Association ==
The FuseNet Association is an independent legal entity that was founded in December 2010 to form the sustainable continuation of the activities started by the equally named FuseNet project. The association provides a platform for the coordination of European fusion education activities, the initiation, development and implementation of new EU-wide actions, and for the exchange and dissemination of fusion education information. All European organizations that are active in the field of fusion education and research are welcome to join the association.
FuseNet is the umbrella organization and single voice for the training and education of the next generation fusion engineers and scientists. FuseNet is recognized as such by the European Commission.

'''''Groupe de femmes''''', also called '''''Groupe de trois femmes''''', or '''''Groupe de trois personnages''''', is an early [[Cubist]] sculpture created circa 1911 by the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[avant-garde]], [[sculpture|sculptor]], and graphic artist [[Joseph Csaky]] (1888–1971). This sculpture formerly known from a black and white photograph (Galerie René Reichard) had been erroneously entitled ''Deux Femmes (Two Women)'', as the image captured on an angle showed only two figures. An additional photograph found in the Csaky family archives shows a frontal view of the work, revealing three figures rather than two. Csaky's sculpture was exhibited at the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]], and the 1913 [[Salon des Indépendants]], Paris. A photograph taken of Salle XI ''in sitiu'' at the 1912 Salon d'Automne and published in ''L'Illustration'', 12 October 1912, p.&amp;nbsp;47, shows ''Groupe de femmes'' exhibited alongside the works of [[Jean Metzinger]], [[František Kupka]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]].

At the 1913 Salon des Indépendants ''Groupe de femmes'' was exhibited in the company works by [[Fernand Léger]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[André Lhote]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Jacques Villon]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcilhac, Félix, 2007, ''Joseph Csaky, Du cubisme historique à la figuration réaliste, catalogue raisonné des sculptures'', Les Editions de l'Amateur, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

The whereabouts of ''Groupe de femmes'' is unknown and the sculpture is presumed to have been destroyed.

==Description==
''Groupe de femmes'' is a plaster sculpture (as many of Csaky's works of the period), carved in a vertical format with unknown dimensions. The work represents three standing nudes, classical in theme (i.e., ''Les trois graces''), yet executed in an abstract stylized [[Cubist]] vocabulary, in opposition to the softness and curvilinearity of [[Nabis]], [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] or [[Art Nouveau]] forms.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ Edith Balas, 1998, Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture , American Philosophical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The dominating central figure is flanked by a woman to her left and another to the right, positioned slightly behind. Two of the women are holding drapery that flows rigidly down to their legs to the base of the sculpture. The figures are constructed with a robust, muscular build, distilled in the form of almost androgynous stature, together forming a tight cohesive mass. The heads and features of the figures, seen in both profile and frontal views, are treated as a series of faceted planar forms that communicated in a strange novel 3-dimensional language; one that at the time broke away from every natural and rational convention.

[[Image:Joseph Csaky, Head, 1913, Plaster lost. Photo René Richard, Joseph Csáky, Frankfurt, 1988.jpg|thumb|210px|upright|[[Joseph Csaky]], ''[[Head (Csaky)|Head (Tête)]]'', 1913, Plaster lost]]
Albert Elsen characterized Csaky's ''Head'' sculpture of 1913 in a way that applies to the heads depicted in ''Groupe de femmes'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;His Head is a brutal asymmetrical reconstruction of the motif that submerges featural identity by a logic of thrusting planar forms. The result, unlike that of [[Emil Filla|Filla]], is the redesigning of the head that is no longer dependent upon a frontal confrontation for the most revealing view, and the consistency of this sculptural context discourages trying to project missing features on the blank planes. The blunt force-fulness with which the head is shaped and thrusts in and out suggests that Csaky had looked not only at Picasso's earlier painting and sculpture, but also at African tribal masks whose exaggerated features and simplified design accommodated the need to be seen at a distance and to evoke strong feeling. (Albert Elsen)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Edward Elsen, ''Origins of modern sculpture: pioneers and premises'', G. Braziller, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Csaky's heads of the period partake in the "stylized, hieratic, nonportrait tradition of tribal and ancient art", writes Edith Balas, "in which there is a total lack of interest in depicting psychological traits". Csaky's ''Groupe de femmes'' and the ''Head'' (1913) "are lost sculptures that testify to Csaky's early immersion in cubism".&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

==History==
This works was likely realized at Csaky's studio in [[La Ruche]]; the artist enclave of [[Montparnasse]], among many members of the Parisian [[avant-garde]]. From the outset of the 20th-century Paris was the art center of the world, where artists came to live and work from all parts of Europe and beyond:&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt; [[Joseph Csaky]] from [[Constantin Brâncuși]] from Hobitza, [[Amedeo Modigliani]] from Livorno, [[Gino Severini]] from Rome, [[Alexander Archipenko]] from Kiev, [[Ossip Zadkine]] from Smolensk, [[Marc Chagall]] from St. Petersburg, [[Jacques Lipchitz]] from Vilna, [[Piet Mondrian]] from Amsterdam, [[Moïse Kisling]] from Kraków, [[Pablo Picasso]] from Barcelona, [[Louis Marcoussis]] from Kraków, [[Chaim Soutine]] from Vilnius.

During his [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] phase Csaky had already separated himself from the past. By 1911-12 Csaky participation in the avant-garde milieu was complete. His acquaintances included [[Gustave Miklos]], Archipenko, Braque, Chagall, Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Le Fauconnier, Laurens, Léger, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Picasso and [[Henri Rousseau]], in addition to [[Pierre Reverdy]], [[Maurice Raynal]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and [[Ricciotto Canudo]].&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

After exhibiting ''Groupe de femmes'' with the Cubists at the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]], [[Grand Palais]] des Champs Elysées—an exhibition that provoked a ''succès de scandal'', and resulted in a xenophobe and anti-modernist quarrel in the French [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]—Csaky exhibited his Cubist works at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], Galerie La Boétie, Paris, October 1912; considered one of the high points of the Cubist movement.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt; Csaky was one of the first artists to apply Cubist principles to sculpture; principles that he would never abandon or disavow.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt; Michel Seuphor has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Csaky, after Archipenko, was the first sculptor to join the cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 on. They were followed by Duchamp-Villon, brother of [[Marcel Duchamp]] and of [[Jacques Villon]], and then in 1914 by Lipchitz, Laurens and Zadkine.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Cubism", Readings in Art History 2, 1976, Seuphor, Sculpture of this Century, 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Groupe de femmes'' Csaky already showed a new way of representing nature, and the unwillingness to revert to classical, academic or traditional methods of representation. The complex syntax observed in ''Groupe de femmes'' was born out of an increasing sense of contemporary dynamism, out of the rhythm, balance, harmony and powerful geometric qualities of Egyptian art, of African art, early Cycladic art, Gothic art, and of [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Cézanne]].

Csaky wrote of the direction his art had taken during the crucial years:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was no question which was my way. True, I was not alone, but in the company of several artists who came from Eastern Europe. I joined the cubists in the [[Académie de La Palette]], which became the sanctuary of the new direction in art. On my part I did not want to imitate anyone or anything. This is why I joined the cubists movement. (Joseph Csaky)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[computer science]], the '''gulf of evaluation''' is the degree to which the [[system]]/[[Artifact (software development)|artifact]] provides [[group representation|representations]] that can be directly perceived and interpreted in terms of the expectations and intentions of the [[user (computing)|user]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman, D: "The Gulf of Evaluation", page 51. Basic Books, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Or put differently, the gulf of evaluation is the difficulty of assessing the state of the system and how well the artifact supports the discovery and interpretation of that state. According to Donald Norman's ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]'' "The gulf is small when the system provides information about its state in a form that is easy to get, is easy to interpret, and matches the way the person thinks of the system".&lt;ref&gt;Norman, D: "The Gulf of Evaluation", page 51. Basic Books, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[human-computer interaction]], the term of ''gulf of evaluation'' stands for the psychological gap that must be crossed to interpret a user interface display, following the steps interface -&gt; perception -&gt; interpretation -&gt; evaluation.

The [[social construction]] of [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]]—its [[taboo]]s, [[regulation]], and [[sociology|social]] and [[politics|political]] impact—has had a profound effect on the various [[culture]]s of the world since [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times.

==The study of the history of human sexuality==
The work of Swiss jurist [[Johann Bachofen]] made a major impact on the study of the history of sexuality. Many authors, notably [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], were influenced by Bachofen, and criticized Bachofen's ideas on the subject, which were almost entirely drawn from a close reading of ancient mythology. In his 1861 book ''Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World'' Bachofen writes that in the beginning human sexuality was chaotic and promiscuous. This "aphroditic" stage was replaced by a matriarchal "demeteric" stage, which resulted from the mother being the only reliable way of establishing descendants. Only upon the switch to male-enforced monogamy was paternity certainty possible, giving rise to patriarchy – the ultimate "apolloan" stage of humanity. While the views of Bachofen are not based on empirical evidence, they are important because of the impact they made on thinkers to come, especially in the field of [[cultural anthropology]].
Modern explanations of the origins of human sexuality are based in [[evolutionary biology]], and specifically the field of [[human behavioral ecology]]. Evolutionary biology shows that the human genotype, like that of all other organisms, is the result of those ancestors who reproduced with greater frequency than others. The resultant sexual behavior adaptations are thus not an "attempt" on the part of the individual to maximize reproduction in a given situation – natural selection does not "see" into the future. Instead, current behavior is probably the result of selective forces that occurred in the Pleistocene.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SxX4gRzOS6oC&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;ots=Bf2t9L2LvI&amp;dq=use%20and%20misusse%20of%20darwinism%20symons&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Adapted Mind (Google Books Link)] "Cognitive Adaptations for Social Change" by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, page 219.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a man trying to have sex with many women all while avoiding parental investment is not doing so because he wants to "increase his fitness", but because the psychological framework that evolved and thrived in the Pleistocene never went away.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SxX4gRzOS6oC&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;ots=Bf2t9L2LvI&amp;dq=use%20and%20misusse%20of%20darwinism%20symons&amp;pg=PA137#v=twopage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Adapted Mind (Google Books Link)] On the Use and Misuse of Darwinism in the Study of Human Behavior by Donald Symons, page 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual speech—and by extension, writing—has been subject to varying standards of decorum since the beginning of [[history]]. For most of historic time writing has not been used by more than a small part of the total population of any society. The resulting self-censorship and euphemistic forms translate today into a dearth of explicit and accurate evidence on which to base a history. There are a number of primary sources that can be collected across a wide variety of times and cultures, including the following:
* Records of legislation indicating either encouragement or prohibition
* [[Religious]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] texts recommending, condemning or debating the topic
* Literary sources, perhaps unpublished during their authors' lifetimes, including diaries and personal correspondence
* [[Medical]] textbooks treating various forms as a pathological condition
* Linguistic developments, particularly in slang.
* More recently, studies of sexuality

[[File:Khajuraho12.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Depictions of [[Apsaras]]es from the [[Khajuraho]] temple]]India played a significant role in the history of sex, from writing one of the first literature that treated [[sexual intercourse]] as a science, to in modern times being the origin of the philosophical focus of [[New Age|new-age]] groups' attitudes on sex. It may be argued that India pioneered the use of [[sexual education]] through art and literature. As in many societies, there was a difference in sexual practices in India between common people and powerful rulers, with people in power often indulging in hedonistic lifestyles that were not representative of common moral attitudes. Many of the common (and not so common) sexual practices in the world today, such as the custom and art of kissing emerged in India, proliferating with early forms of globalization.

[[File:Meister des Mahâjanaka Jâtaka 001.jpg|thumb|Fresco murals from the Ajanta caves]]

The first evidence of attitudes towards sex comes from the ancient texts of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], the first of which are perhaps the oldest surviving literature in the world. These most ancient texts, the [[Rig Veda|Vedas]], reveal moral perspectives on sexuality, marriage and fertility prayers. [[Sex magic]] featured in a number of Vedic rituals, most significantly in the [[Ashvamedha|Asvamedha Yajna]], where the ritual culminated with the chief queen lying with the dead horse in a simulated sexual act; clearly a fertility rite intended to safeguard and increase the kingdom's productivity and martial prowess. The epics of ancient India, the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], which may have been first composed as early as 1400 BCE, had a huge effect on the culture of [[Asia]], influencing later [[China|Chinese]], [[Japan]]ese, [[Tibet]]an and [[South East Asia]]n culture. These texts support the view that in ancient India, sex was considered a mutual duty between a married couple, where husband and wife pleasured each other equally, but where sex was considered a private affair, at least by followers of the aforementioned Indian religions. It seems that [[polygamy]] was allowed during ancient times. In practice, this seems to have only been practiced by rulers, with common people maintaining a monogamous marriage. It is common in many cultures for a ruling class to practice polygamy as a way of preserving dynastic succession

The most publicly known sexual literature of India are the texts of the [[Kama Sutra]]. These texts were written for and kept by the philosopher, warrior and nobility castes, their servants and concubines, and those in certain religious orders. These were people that could also read and write and had instruction and education. The sixty four arts of love-passion-pleasure began in India. There are many different versions of the arts which began in [[Sanskrit]] and were translated into other languages, such as Persian or Tibetan. Many of the original texts are missing and the only clue to their existence is in other texts. [[Kama Sutra]], the version by Vatsyayana, is one of the well-known survivors and was first translated into [[English language|English]] by Sir [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]] and F. F. Arbuthnot. The [[Kama Sutra]] is now perhaps the most widely read secular text in the world. It details ways in which partners should pleasure each other within a marital relationship.

[[File:Khajurahosculpture.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture from a temple at Khajuraho]]
When the [[Islamic]] and [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] [[English people|English]] culture arrived in India, they generally had an adverse impact on sexual liberalism in India. Within the context of the Indian religions, or dharmas, such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], sex is generally either seen as a moral duty of each partner in a long term marriage relationship to the other, or is seen as a desire which hinders spiritual detachment, and so must be renounced. In modern India, a renaissance of sexual liberalism has occurred amongst the well-educated urban population, but there is still discrimination and forced marriage incidents amongst the poor.

Within certain schools of Indian philosophy, such as [[Tantra]], the emphasis in sex as a sacred duty, or even a path to spiritual enlightenment or yogic balance is greatly emphasized. Actual sexual intercourse is not a part of every form of tantric practice, but it is the definitive feature of left-hand Tantra. Contrary to popular belief, "Tantric sex" is not always slow and sustained, and may end in orgasm. For example, the Yoni Tantra states: "there should be vigorous copulation". However, all tantra states that there were certain groups of personalities who were not fit for certain practices. Tantra was personality specific and insisted that those with pashu-bhava (animal disposition), which are people of dishonest, promiscuous, greedy or violent natures who ate meat and indulged in intoxication, would only incur bad karma by following Tantric paths without the aid of a Guru who could instruct them on the correct path. In Buddhist tantra, actual ejaculation is very much a taboo, as the main goal of the sexual practice is to use the sexual energy towards achieving full enlightenment, rather than ordinary pleasure. [[Tantric sex]] is considered to be a pleasurable experience in Tantra philosophy.

===China===
In the ''[[I Ching]]'' (The ''Book of Changes'', a Chinese classic text dealing with divination) sexual intercourse is one of two fundamental models used to explain the world. With neither embarrassment nor circumlocution, Heaven is described as having sexual intercourse with Earth. Similarly, with no sense of prurient interest, the male lovers of early Chinese men of great political power are mentioned in one of the earliest great works of philosophy and literature, the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuang Zi]]'' (or ''Chuang Tzu'', as it is written in the old system of romanization).

China has had a long history of sexism, with even moral leaders such as Confucius giving extremely pejorative accounts of the innate characteristics of women. From early times, the [[virginity]] of women was rigidly enforced by family and community and linked to the monetary value of women as a kind of commodity (the "sale" of women involving the delivery of a [[bride price]]). Men were protected in their own sexual adventures by a transparent double standard. While the first wife of a man with any kind of social status in traditional society was almost certainly chosen for him by his [[father]] and/or [[grandfather]], the same man might later secure for himself more desirable sexual partners with the status of concubines. In addition, [[serfdom|bondservants]] in his possession could also be sexually available to him. Naturally, not all men had the financial resources to so greatly indulge themselves.

Chinese literature displays a long history of interest in affection, marital bliss, unabashed sexuality, romance, amorous dalliances, homosexual alliances—in short, all of the aspects of behavior that are affiliated with sexuality in the West. Besides the previously mentioned ''Zhuang Zi'' passages, sexuality is exhibited in other works of literature such as the [[Tang dynasty]] ''[[Yingying zhuan]]'' (''[[Biography of Cui Yingying]]''), the [[Qing dynasty]] ''[[Fu sheng liu ji]]'' (''[[Six Chapters of a Floating Life]]''), the humorous and intentionally salacious ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]'', and the multi-faceted and insightful ''[[Hong lou meng]]'' (''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'', also called ''[[Story of the Stone]]''). Of the above, only the story of Yingying and her de facto husband Zhang fail to describe homosexual as well as heterosexual interactions. The novel entitled ''[[Rou bu tuan]]'' (''[[Prayer mat of flesh]]'') even describes cross-species organ transplants for the sake of enhanced sexual performance. Among Chinese literature are the [[Taoist]] classical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigeye.com/sexeducation/ancientchina.html bigeye.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophical tradition of China has developed [[Taoist Sexual Practices]] which have three main goals: health, longevity, and spiritual development.

The desire for respectability and the belief that all aspects of human behavior might be brought under government control has until recently mandated to official Chinese spokesmen that they maintain the fiction of sexual fidelity in marriage, absence of any great frequency of [[premarital sexual intercourse]], and total absence in China of the so-called "decadent capitalist phenomenon" of homosexuality. The result of the ideological demands preventing objective examination of sexual behavior in China has, until very recently, made it extremely difficult for the government to take effective action against [[sexually transmitted diseases]], especially [[AIDS]]. At the same time, large migrations to the cities coupled with China's gender imbalance and significant amounts of unemployment have led to resurgence of prostitution in unregulated venues, a prominent accelerant of the propagation of STDs to many ordinary members of society.

In recent decades the power of the family over individuals has weakened, making it increasingly possible for young men and women to find their own sexual and/or marriage partners.

{{Main|Sexuality in Japan}}
In what is often called the world's first novel, the ''[[Genji Monogatari]]'' (''[[Tale of Genji]]''), which dates back to around the eighth century AD, eroticism is treated as a central part of the aesthetic life of the nobility. The sexual interactions of Prince Genji are described in great detail, in an objective tone of voice, and in a way that indicates that sexuality was as much a valued component of cultured life as music or any of the arts. While most of his erotic interactions involve women, there is one telling episode in which Genji travels a fairly long distance to visit one of the women with whom he occasionally consorts but finds her away from home. It being late, and intercourse already being on the menu of the day, Genji takes pleasure in the availability of the lady's younger brother who, he reports, is equally satisfactory as an erotic partner.

From that time on to at least as late as the [[Meiji Reformation]], there is no indication that sexuality was treated in a pejorative way. In modern times homosexuality was driven out of sight until it reemerged in the wake of the sexual revolution with seemingly little if any need for a period of acceleration. [[Yukio Mishima]], probably the best-known Japanese writer in the outside world, frequently wrote about homosexuality, and its relationship with Japanese culture new and old. Likewise, prostitution, pornography, the tradition of the [[Geisha]], and countless types of fetish and sadomasochism have resurfaced after decades underground.

In Japan, sexuality was governed by the same social forces that make its culture considerably different from that of China, Korea, India, or Europe. In Japanese society, the primary method used to secure social control is the threat of ostracism. Japanese society is still very much a [[shame society]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  More attention is paid to what is polite or appropriate to show others than to which behaviors might make a person seem "corrupt" or "guilty", in the Christian sense of the words. The tendency of people in Japanese society to group in terms of "in groups" and "out groups" - residue of its long history as a caste society – is a source of great pressure on every facet of society, via pop culture (reflected in the tribal, often materialistic, and very complex nature of teenage subcultures) as well as more traditional standards (as in the high-pressure role of the [[salaryman]]). Sexual expression ranges from a requirement to a complete taboo, and many, especially teenagers, find themselves playing many otherwise strictly-separate roles during the week.

A frequent locus of misconceptions in regard to Japanese sexuality is the institution of the [[geisha]]. Rather than being a prostitute, a geisha was a woman trained in arts such as music and cultured conversation, and who was available for non-sexual interactions with her male clientele. These women differed from the wives that their patrons probably had at home because, except for the geisha, women were ordinarily not expected to be prepared for anything other than the fulfillment of household duties. This limitation imposed by the normal social role of the majority of women in traditional society produced a diminution in the pursuits that those women could enjoy, but also a limitation in the ways that a man could enjoy the company of his wife. The geisha fulfilled the non-sexual social roles that ordinary women were prevented from fulfilling, and for this service they were well paid. The geisha were not deprived of opportunities to express themselves sexually and in other erotic ways. A geisha might have a patron with whom she enjoyed sexual intimacy, but this sexual role was not part of her role or responsibility as a geisha.

As a superficial level, in traditional Japanese society women were expected to be highly subservient to men and especially to their husbands. So, in a socionormal description of their roles, they were little more than housekeepers and faithful sexual partners to their husbands. Their husbands, on the other hand, might consort sexually with whomever they chose outside of the family, and a major part of male social behavior involves after-work forays to places of entertainment in the company of male cohorts from the workplace—places that might easily offer possibilities of sexual satisfaction outside the family. In the postwar period this side of Japanese society has seen some liberalization in regard to the norms imposed on women as well as an expansion of the de facto powers of women in the family and in the community that existed unacknowledged in traditional society.

In the years since people first became aware of the AIDS epidemic, Japan has not suffered the high rates of disease and death that characterize, for example, some nations in Africa, some nations in Southeast Asia, etc. In 1992, the government of Japan justified its continued refusal to allow oral contraceptives to be distributed in Japan on the fear that it would lead to reduced condom use, and thus increase transmission of AIDS.&lt;!--

{{See also|Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Pederasty in ancient Greece|Prostitution in ancient Greece}}

In ancient [[Greece]], the [[phallus]], often in the form of a [[herma]], was an object of worship as a symbol of fertility. This finds expression in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[sculpture]] and other artworks. One ancient Greek male idea of female sexuality was that women envied penises of males. Wives were considered as commodity and instruments for bearing legitimate children. They had to compete sexually with [[eromenoi]], [[hetaera]]s and slaves in their own homes.

Both [[Homosexuality]] and [[Bisexuality]], in the form of ephebophilia (in some ways slavery), were social institutions in ancient Greece, and were integral to education, art, religion, and politics. Relationships between adults were not unknown but they were disfavored. [[Lesbian]] relations were also of a pederastic nature.

In ancient Greece, it was common for men to have sexual relationships with youths. These practices were a sign of maturity for youths, who looked up to men as sexual mentors.

Ancient Greek men believed that refined [[Prostitution in ancient Greece|prostitution]] was necessary for pleasure and different classes of prostitutes were available. Hetaera, educated and intelligent companions, were for intellectual as well as physical pleasure, [[Nomad|Peripatetic]] prostitutes solicited business on the streets, whereas temple or consecrated prostitutes charged a higher price. In [[Corinth]], a port city, on the [[Aegean Sea]], the temple held a thousand consecrated prostitutes.

[[Rape]] – usually in the context of warfare – was common and was seen by men as a “right of domination”. Rape in the sense of "abduction" followed by consensual lovemaking was represented even in religion: [[Zeus]] was said to have ravished many women: Leda in the form of a swan, [[Danaë]] disguised as a golden rain, [[Alkmene]] disguised as her own husband. Zeus also raped a boy, [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], a myth that paralleled [[Cretan pederasty|Cretan]] custom.

====Etruria====
The ancient [[Etruscans]] had very different views on sexuality, when compared with the other European ancient peoples, most of whom had inherited the Indo-European traditions and views on the gender roles.

Greek writers, such as [[Theopompus]] and [[Plato]] named the Etruscan 'immoral' and from their descriptions we find out that the women commonly had sex with men who were not their husbands and that in their society, children were not labelled "[[illegitimacy|illegitimate]]" just because they did not know who the father was. Theopompus also described orgiastic rituals, but it is not clear whether they were a common custom or only a minor ritual dedicated to a certain deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38040291|title=Theopompus of Chios : history and rhetoric in the fourth century BC|last=A.|first=Flower, Michael|date=1997|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0198152434|location=Oxford|oclc=38040291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Sexuality in ancient Rome|Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Prostitution in ancient Rome}}
The [[Roman citizenship|citizen]]'s duty to control his body was central to the concept of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|male sexuality]] in the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; "Virtue" ''([[virtus (virtue)|virtus]]'', from ''vir'', "man") was equated with "manliness." The equivalent virtue for [[Women in Ancient Rome|female citizens]] of good social standing was ''[[pudicitia]]'', a form of sexual integrity that displayed their attractiveness and self-control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rebecca Langlands]], ''Sexual Morality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 37–38 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Female sexuality|Female sexuality]] was encouraged [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Marital sex|within marriage]]. In [[paterfamilias|Roman patriarchal society]], a "real man" was supposed to govern both himself and others well, and should not submit to the use or pleasure of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Same-sex behaviors]] were not perceived as diminishing a Roman's masculinity, as long as he played the penetrative or dominating role. Acceptable male partners were social inferiors such as [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|prostitutes, entertainers]], and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|slaves]]. [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|Sex with freeborn male minors]] was formally prohibited (see ''[[Lex Scantinia]]''). "Homosexual" and "heterosexual" thus did not form the primary dichotomy of Roman thinking about sexuality, and no [[Latin]] words for these concepts exist.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, ''Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome'' (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of frank sexuality are abundant in [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Erotic literature and art|Roman literature and art]]. The ''[[fascinum]]'', a [[phallic]] charm, was a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|ubiquitous decoration]]. [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex acts and positions|Sexual positions and scenarios]] are depicted in great variety among the [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|wall paintings preserved at Pompeii and Herculaneum]]. Collections of poetry celebrated love affairs, and ''[[Ars Amatoria|The Art of Love]]'' by the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poet]] [[Ovid]] playfully instructed both men and women in how to attract and enjoy lovers. Elaborate theories of human sexuality based on [[ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] were developed by thinkers such as [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Epicurean sexuality|Lucretius]] and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Stoic sexual morality|Seneca]]. [[Classical mythology|Classical myths]] often deal with sexual themes such as [[gender identity]], [[adultery]], [[incest]], and [[rape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/212125918|title=Sexuality and gender in the classical world : readings and sources|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=McClure, Laura, 1959-, Wiley InterScience (Online service)|isbn=0470755539|location=Oxford, UK|oclc=212125918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other aspects of Roman life, sexuality was supported and regulated by [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional Roman religion]], both the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex, religion and the state|public cult of the state]] and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Healing and magic|private religious practices and magic]].&lt;ref&gt;As argued by Ariadne Staples throughout ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion'' (Routledge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] held that the desire to procreate ''([[libido]])'' was "the seedbed of the republic," as it was the cause for the first form of social institution, [[Marriage in ancient Rome|marriage]], which in turn created the family, regarded by the Romans as the building block of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De officiis]]'' 1.17.54; Sabine MacCormack, "Sin, Citizenship, and the Salvation of Souls: The Impact of Christian Priorities on Late-Roman and Post-Roman Society," ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 39.4 (1997), p. 651.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman law]] penalized sex crimes ''([[stuprum]])'', particularly [[History of rape#Ancient Rome|rape]], as well as [[Marriage in ancient Rome#Adultery|adultery]]. A Roman husband, however, committed the crime of adultery only when his sexual partner was a married woman.

[[Prostitution in ancient Rome|Prostitution]] was legal, public, and widespread. Entertainers of any gender were assumed to be sexually available (see ''[[infamia]]''), and [[gladiator]]s were sexually [[Glamour (presentation)|glamorous]]. [[Slavery in ancient Rome|Slaves]] lacked [[legal person]]hood, and were vulnerable to [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|sexual exploitation]].

The dissolution of Republican ideals of physical integrity in relation to political liberty contributes to and is reflected by the sexual license and decadence associated with the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;This is a theme throughout Carlin A. Barton, ''The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster'' (Princeton University Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Anxieties about the loss of liberty and the subordination of the citizen to the emperor were expressed by a perceived increase in passive homosexual behavior among free men.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "Sexuality in the Roman Empire," in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire'', p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexual conquest and imperialism|Sexual conquest]] was a frequent metaphor for Roman imperialism.:&lt;ref&gt;Davina C. Lopez, "Before Your Very Eyes: Roman Imperial Ideology, Gender Constructs and Paul's Inter-Nationalism," in ''Mapping Gender in Ancient Religious Discourses'' (Brill, 2007), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Children slept in the same room as their parents and were able to witness their parents while they had sex. Intercourse simulation became real penetration as soon as boys were physically able. Adults found simulation of sex by children to be funny. As children approached 11 attitudes shifted toward girls.

Premarital sex was not encouraged but was allowed in general, restrictions on adolescent sexuality were incest, exogamy regulations, and  firstborn daughters of high-ranking lineage. After their firstborn child, high-ranking women were permitted extramarital affairs.

===Twentieth Century: Sexual revolution===
{{Main|Sexual revolution}}

The second sexual revolution was a substantial change in [[sexual morality]] and [[human sexual behaviour|sexual behaviour]] throughout the West in the 1960s and early 1970s. One factor in the change of values pertaining to sexual activities was the invention of new, efficient technologies for the personal control of ability to enter pregnancy. Prime among them, at that time, was the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|first birth control pill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/pill-and-marriage-revolution|title=The pill and the marriage revolution {{!}} The Clayman Institute for Gender Research|website=gender.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberalized laws on abortion in many countries likewise made it possible to safely and legally break off an unwanted pregnancy without having to invoke a birth posing grave danger to the health of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903358,00.html?promoid=googlep%7ctitle=Abortion_and_Privacy%7caccessdate=2013-12-13|work=Time|date=13 March 1972|title=The Law: Abortion and Privacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of homosexuality}}
Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death.

In a detailed compilation of historical and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] materials of [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial cultures]], "strong disapproval of homosexuality was reported for 41% of 42 cultures; it was accepted or ignored by 21%, and 12% reported no such concept. Of 70 ethnographies, 59% reported homosexuality absent or rare in frequency and 41% reported it present or not uncommon." &lt;ref&gt;Adolescence and puberty By John Bancroft, June Machover Reinisch, p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultures influenced by [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Sodomy law#History|law]] and the [[Christianity and homosexuality#History of Christianity and homosexuality|church]] established [[sodomy]] as a transgression against divine law or a [[crime against nature]]. The condemnation of [[anal sex]] between males, however, predates Christian belief. It was frequent in ancient Greece; "unnatural" can be traced back to [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;"... sow illegitimate and bastard seed in [[courtesan]]s, or sterile seed in males in defiance of nature." — [[Plato]], in ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' (Book VIII p.841 edition of Stephanus or p.340, edition of Penguin Books, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historical figures, including [[Socrates]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], and [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Homosexuality'', Craig Arthur Williams, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; have had terms such as ''gay'' or ''[[bisexuality|bisexual]]'' applied to them; some scholars, such as [[Michel Foucault]], have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary [[social constructionism|construction]] of sexuality foreign to their times,&lt;ref name="foucault"&gt;{{harv|Foucault|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; though others challenge this.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, Review of David M. Halperin, ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality.'' in ''[[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]]'' 2003.09.22&lt;/ref&gt;

A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. John Boswell has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by Plato,&lt;ref name=boswell1&gt;{{harv|Boswell|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.

==Religion and sex==
{{Main|Religion and sexuality}}

===Judaism===
In Jewish law, sex is not considered intrinsically sinful or shameful when conducted in marriage, nor is it a necessary evil for the purpose of procreation. Sex is considered a private and holy act between a husband and wife. Certain deviant sexual practices, enumerated below, were considered gravely immoral "abominations" sometimes punishable by death. The residue of sex was considered ritually unclean outside the body, and required [[Ritual washing in Judaism|ablution]].&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baarda|first1=Benjamin I.|last2=Sikora|first2=Aleksandra E.|title=Proteomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: the treasure hunt for countermeasures against an old disease|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=6|year=2015|issn=1664-302X|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01190|postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, some scholars have questioned whether the Old Testament banned all forms of homosexuality, raising issues of translation and references to ancient cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shrine Prostitutes – Is THAT what Moses was talking about in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13?|url=http://www.gaychristian101.com/Shrine-Prostitutes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rabbinic Judaism had unambiguously condemned homosexuality.

====Mosaic law====
*''And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the sky and over all the beasts that tread upon the earth.'' (Genesis 1:28)

The [[Torah]], while being quite frank in its description of various sexual acts, forbids certain relationships. Namely, [[adultery]], all forms of [[incest]], male [[homosexuality]], [[bestiality]], and introduced the idea that one should not have sex during the wife's [[Menstrual cycle|period]]:
*''You shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife, to become defiled by her.'' (Lev. 18:20)
*''Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.'' (Lev. 18:22)
*''And with no animal shall you cohabit, to become defiled by it. And a woman shall not stand in front of an animal to cohabit with it; this is depravity.'' (Lev. 18:23)
*''And to a woman during the uncleanness of her separation, you shall not come near to uncover her nakedness.'' (Lev. 18:19)

The above passages may, however, be open to modern interpretation. The original meanings of these verses did not change, but their interpretation may have changed after they were translated into English and other languages. This view however, has been counteracted by conservatives.

===Christianity===
Christianity re-emphasised the Jewish attitudes on sexuality with two new concepts. First, there was the re-iterated idea that marriage was absolutely exclusive and indissoluble, placing further guidance on divorce and expanding on the reasons and principles behind those laws. Second, in Old Testament times marriage was almost universal, in continuity with the total matrimony in Eden, but in the New Testament, the trajectory is extended forward to the goal of no marriage in the new heavens and new earth (see Matthew 22). Practically therefore the new age after Jesus now has marriage as only normative, but celibacy is a valuable gift in and of itself.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

====New Testament====
The [[New Testament]] is quite clear on principles regarding sexual relations. In one of his letters to the Corinthian church, Paul directly answers some questions they had asked about this.

{{quote|1 Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: 'It is well for a man not to touch a woman.' 2 But because of cases of sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. 3 The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. 4 For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. 5 Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 6 This I say by way of concession, not of command. 7 I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind." (1 Corinthians 7:1-9, NRSV)}}

Paul is speaking into a situation where the church was falling into lust, and some members even using prostitutes (6:16), while others advocated a 'higher spirituality' that wrongly denied pleasure from earthly things, including abstinence from sex (7:1). Paul writes to them to explain the right context for sex in marriage, and the importance of couples keeping having sex and giving each other pleasure, but encourages them to pursue celibacy (as he later explains [7:32-35], so that they may devote more time and energy to others) wherever God has granted that gift (7:7).

Many other passages refer to sex or marriage.

====Later Christian thought====
St. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] opined that before Adam's fall, there was no lust in the sexual act, but that it was entirely subordinate to human reason. Later theologians similarly concluded that the lust involved in sexuality was a result of [[original sin]], but nearly all agreed that this was only a venial sin if conducted within marriage without inordinate lust.

In Reformed schools, as represented for example by the [[Westminster Confession]], three purposes of marriage are drawn out: for mutual encouragement, support, and pleasure; for having children; and to prevent lustful sin.

Today, many Christians have adopted the view that there is no sin whatsoever in the uninhibited enjoyment of marital relations. Some Christians will tend to limit the circumstances and degree to which sexual pleasure is morally licit, for example to build self-control to prevent sex becoming addictive, or as a fast.

===Hinduism===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}

In India, [[Hinduism]] accepted an open attitude towards sex as an art, science and spiritual practice. The most famous pieces of Indian literature on sex are [[Kamasutra]] (Aphorisms on Love) and [[Kamashastra]] (from Kama = pleasure, shastra = specialised knowledge or technique). This collection of explicit sexual writings, both spiritual and practical, covers most aspects of human courtship and sexual intercourse. It was put together in this form by the sage [[Vatsyayana]] from a 150 chapter manuscript that had itself been distilled from 300 chapters that had in turn come from a compilation of some 100,000 chapters of text. The Kamasutra is thought to have been written in its final form sometime between the third and fifth century AD.

Also notable are the sculptures carved on temples in India, particularly the [[Khajuraho]] temple. The frank depiction of uninhibited sex hints towards a liberated society and times where people believed in dealing openly with all aspects of life. On the other hand, a group of thinkers believe that depiction of sexually implicit carvings outside the temples indicate that one should enter the temples leaving desires (kama).

Apart from Vatsyayana's Kamashastra, which is no doubt the most famous of all such writings, there exist a number of other books, for example:
*The ''[[Ratirahasya]]'', literal translation – secrets (rahasya) of love (rati, the union);
*The ''[[Panchasakya]]'', or the five (panch) arrows (sakya);
*The ''[[Ratimanjari]]'', or the garland (manjari) of love (rati, the union)
*The ''[[Anunga Runga]]'', or the stage of love.

The ''Secrets of Love'' was written by a poet named Kukkoka. He is believed to have written this treatise on his work to please one Venudutta, considered to be a king. This work was translated into Hindi years ago and the author's name became Koka in short and the book he wrote was called ''[[Ratirahasya|Koka Shastra]]''. The same name crept into all the translations into other languages in India. ''Koka Shastra'' literally means doctrines of Koka, which is identical with the ''Kama Shastra'', or doctrines of love, and the names ''Koka Shastra'' and ''Kama Shastra'' are used indiscriminately.

===Islam===
In [[Islam]] sexual intercourse is allowed only after [[marriage]] and only with one's spouse. Sex outside of marriage is prohibited, called [[zina]], as is adultery, which is considered a sin and is strictly prohibited and  punishable. According to the chapter Al-Israa', verse 32 of the [[Qur'an]], [[Allah]] (God) prohibits Muslims from getting close to (engaging in) zina, and having relations with anyone other than one's spouse. And since marriage is only between a man and a woman, any sexual intercourse between two men is prohibited. Islam does not accept homosexuality or allow anal sex even between married couples or even during menstrual cycles. Furthermore, sex is like an act of charity if done with right intentions. One cannot seek sexual means outside of marriage and must lower gaze when outside.

==Technology and sex==
In the mid 20th century advances in medical science and modern understanding of the [[menstrual cycle]] led to observational, surgical, chemical and laboratory techniques to allow diagnosis and the treatment of many forms of infertility.

==Pederasty==
{{Seealso|Pederasty|Shudo|Pederasty in ancient Greece|Shunga|Shotacon}}

Many cultures normalized or promoted adult males and male youths, usually teenagers, entering into pedagogic friendships or love affairs that also had an erotic dimension. These were usually sexually expressed, but chaste ones were not infrequent. If sexual, that phase of the relationship lasted until the youth was ready for adulthood and marriage. Other cultures saw such relationships as inimical to their interests – often on religious grounds – and tried to stamp them out.

==Zoophilia==
{{Main|History of zoophilia}}
[[Zoophilia]] or bestiality—sexual activity between humans and animals—probably dates back to prehistory. Depictions of humans and animals in a sexual context appear infrequently in [[rock art]] in Europe beginning around the onset of the [[Neolithic]] and the domestication of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bahn|first=Paul G.|title=The Cambridge illustrated history of prehistoric art|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-45473-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwm_D1u_UTsC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq|accessdate=18 February 2012|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bestiality remained a common theme in mythology and folklore through the classical period and into the Middle Ages (e.g. ''[[Leda and the Swan]]'')&lt;ref name="HSEB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Cornog|first1=M.|last2=Perper|first2=T.|year=1994|title=Bestiality|editor1-last=Haeberle|editor1-first=E.

Explicit legal prohibition of human sexual contact with animals is a legacy of the [[Abrahamic religions]]:&lt;ref name="HSEB" /&gt; the [[Hebrew Bible]] imposes the death penalty on both the person and animal involved in an act of bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:15|131}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several examples known from medieval Europe of people and animals executed for committing bestiality. With the [[Age of Enlightenment]], bestiality was subsumed with other sexual "crimes against nature" into civil [[sodomy]] laws, usually remaining a capital crime.

Bestiality remains [[Zoophilia and the law|illegal in most countries]]. Though religious and "crime against nature" arguments may still be used to justify this, today the central issue is the ability of non-human animals to give [[consent]]: it is argued that sex with animals is inherently [[Sexual abuse|abusive]].&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Tom. ''Animal Rights, Human Wrongs''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, pp. 63-4, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In common with many [[paraphilia]]s, the [[internet]] has allowed the formation of a zoophile community that has begun to lobby for zoophilia to be considered an alternative sexuality and for the legalisation of bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Francis|first=Thomas|title=Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They're Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2009-08-20/news/those-who-practice-bestiality-say-they-re-part-of-the-next-gay-rights-movement/|accessdate=18 February 2012|newspaper=Broward Palm Beach New Times|date=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prostitution==
{{Main|History of prostitution}}

[[Prostitution]] is the sale of sexual services, such as oral sex or sexual intercourse. Prostitution has been described as the "world's oldest profession". Gonorrhoeae is recorded at least up to 700 years ago and associated with a district in Paris formerly known as "Le Clapiers". This is where the prostitutes were to be found at that time.&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015" /&gt;

In some cultures, prostitution has been an element of religious practices. [[Religious prostitution]] is well documented in the ancient cultures of the near East, such as [[Sumer]], [[Babylon]], [[ancient Greece]] and [[Israel]], where prostitutes appear in the [[Bible]]. In [[Greece]] the [[hetaerae]] were often women of high social class, whereas in [[Rome]] the [[meretrices]] were of lower social order. The [[Devadasi]], prostitutes of [[Hindu]] temples in south [[India]], were made illegal by the Indian government in 1988.

==Sexually transmitted diseases==
{{Main|Sexually transmitted diseases|Safe sex}}
For much of human history, sexually transmitted diseases have been a scourge of humanity. They raged unchecked through society until the discovery of [[antibiotics]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The development of inexpensive condoms and education about sexually transmitted diseases has helped reduce risks. For a period of about thirty years (in the second half of the twentieth century) their threat subsided.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, due to the free movement of people and uncontrolled distribution of antibiotics, organisms resistant to antibiotics quickly spread and at the present time pose a threat to people who have more than one sex partner.

===AIDS===
{{Main|AIDS}}
AIDS has profoundly changed modern sexuality. It was first noticed (although many historians feel that the first case was in 1959) spreading among [[Homosexuality|gay]] men and [[recreational drug use|intravenous drug users]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, the majority of victims are [[heterosexual]] women, men, and children in [[developing countries]]. In most developing countries, fear of epidemic has drastically changed many aspects of twentieth century human sexuality. Fear of contracting AIDS has driven a revolution in [[sex education]], which now centers far more the use of protection and [[abstinence]], and spends much more time discussing sexually transmitted diseases.

Further effects of this disease run deep, radically impacting the expected average lifespan as reported by the BBC News: "[The expected average lifespan] is falling in many African countries – a girl born today in [[Sierra Leone]] could expect only to live to 36, in contrast to [[Japan]], where today's newborn girl might reach 85 on average."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3330155.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16133">In [[ecology]], an '''ideal free distribution''' is a way in which animals distribute themselves among several patches of resources.  The theory states that the number of individual animals that will aggregate in various patches is proportional to the amount of resources available in each.  For example, if patch A contains twice as many resources as patch B, there will be twice as many individuals [[foraging]] in patch A as in patch B.  The ideal free distribution (IFD) theory predicts that the distribution of animals among patches will minimize resource competition and maximize fitness.&lt;ref name="fret"&gt;Fretwell, S. D. 1972. ''Populations in a Seasonal Environment''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fret2"&gt;Fretwell, S. D. &amp; Lucas, H. L., Jr. 1970. On territorial behavior and other factors influencing habitat distribution in birds. I. Theoretical Development. ''Acta Biotheoretica'' 19: 16&amp;ndash;36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "ideal" implies that animals are aware of each patch's quality, and they choose to forage in the patch with the highest quality.  The term "free" implies that animals are capable of moving unhindered from one patch to another.  Although these assumptions are not always upheld in nature, there are still many experiments that have been performed in support of IFD, even if populations naturally deviate between patches before reaching IFD.  IFD theory can still be used to analyze [[foraging]] behaviors of animals, whether those behaviors support IFD, or violate it.

==Assumptions and predictions==

The ideal free distribution theory is based on several assumptions and predictions as indicated below;

===Assumptions===
'''1)''' Each available patch has an '''individual quality''' that is determined by the amount of resources available in each patch.  Given that there is not yet any competition in each patch, individuals can assess the quality of each patch based merely on the resources available.

'''2)''' Individuals are '''free''' to move to the highest quality patch.  However, this can be violated by dominant individuals within a species who may keep a weaker individual from reaching the ideal patch.

'''3)''' Individuals are aware of the value of each patch so that they can choose the '''ideal''' patch.

'''4)''' Increasing the number of individuals in a given patch reduces the quality of that patch, through either increased [[scramble competition]] or increased [[interference competition]].

'''5)''' All individuals are '''competitively equal''', so they are all equally able to forage and choose the ideal patch.

===Predictions===

Once the assumptions are met, IFD theory predicts that a population of individuals will distribute themselves equally among patches with the '''same intrinsic value'''.  Various deviations may occur initially, but eventually the patches will accommodate the number of individuals that is proportional to the amount of resources they each contain.  In this case, patches of equal intrinsic value allow for the same number of individuals in each patch.  At this point, the state of the individuals is referred to as '''[[Nash equilibrium]]'''.  Once the individuals are in Nash equilibrium, any migration to a different patch will be disadvantageous since all individuals obtain the same benefits.

[[File:IFD - Nash Equilibrium.jpg|thumb|Figure 1]]

For patches with unequal innate values, or intrinsic values, we can still apply the same distribution principle.  However, it is predicted that the number of individuals in each patch will differ, as the amount of resources in each patch will be unequal.  They will still reach [[Nash equilibrium]] despite the fact that there is an unequal number of competitors in each patch.  This equilibrium is demonstrated as the red line in Figure 1, where the feeding rate is the same for all individuals even though there are 5 individuals in Patch A and 8 individuals in Patch B.  From the figure, we can infer that the first 6 foragers settle in Patch B due to its greater intrinsic quality, but the increased competition causes the lesser quality Patch A to be more beneficial for the seventh individual.  This figure is depicting the '''habitat matching effect''', through which the ratio of individuals at the patches corresponds to the ratio of resources available in those patches.&lt;ref name="danc"&gt;Danchin, E., Giraldeau, L.-A., &amp; Cézilly, F. (2008). Behavioural ecology. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==

=== Experimental data ===

''Anelosimus eximius'', a species of social spiders, live together cooperatively and build large web communities. Number of insects caught decreases with increasing population due to surface area scaling, but prey mass increased due to larger webs. At intermediate population size of 1000, prey biomass per capita was maximized. The results correspond to observed results of population size and ecological conditions- areas that lack larger insects have smaller spider communities.&lt;ref name="yip"&gt;Yip, E., Powers, K., &amp; Aviles, L. (2008). Cooperative capture of large prey solves scaling challenge faced by spider societies. PNAS, 105(33), 11818-11822. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0710603105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bumblebees distribute themselves systematically so that there was an equalization of gain per flower (the currency) in flowers of different nectar production. Bees were also distributed proportionally based on plant density.&lt;ref name="dreis"&gt;Dreisig, H. (1995). Ideal free distributions of nectar foraging bumblebees. [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]], 72(2), 161-172. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3546218&lt;/ref&gt; In Selous wild dogs, observed pack size did not agree with results of daily per capita food intake. However, when factoring in distance traveled to hunt into the currency, observed pack size was close to optimal.&lt;ref name="creel"&gt;Creel &amp; Creel. (1995). Communal hunting and pack size in African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus. Animal Behaviour, 50(5), 1325-1339. {{doi|10.1016/0003-3472(95)80048-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unequal competitors===

The ideal free distribution hypothesis assumes that all individuals are equal in competitive abilities. However, there is experimental evidence that demonstrates that even when the competitive abilities, or weights, of individuals in a population differ, the ideal free distribution is still mostly upheld as long as these differences are accounted for. In accounting for this variety of competitive weights, animals distribute such that their competitive weights in each habitat match the proportion of resources present there. For example, in one experiment goldfish differing in competitive ability behaved in a way that maximized their intake rate relative to their competitive weight. Since the mean rank of fish in a site varied inversely with the total number of fish in both the high resource density site and the low resource density site, there was no correlation between competitive ability and time spent at the higher resource density site. As expected in an ideally distributed population of goldfish of different competitive abilities, the intake rate of each competitive weight did not differ between the sites.&lt;ref name="suth"&gt;Sutherland, W.J., C.R. Townsend, and J.M. Patmore. "A test of the ideal free distribution with unequal competitors." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. 23.1 (1988): 51-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, foraging behavior in coho salmon does not uphold ideal free distribution predicted by the equal competitors model, but does uphold ideal free distribution with the inclusion of competitive inequalities. In other words, the distribution of the number of fish was significantly different from the distribution of the competitive weights. When exposed to a poor patch and a good patch, the fish distributed such that the payoffs per unit of competitive weight were the same at both patches. This experiment demonstrates that the incorporation of competitive weights into habitat selection can improve predictions of animal distributions.&lt;ref name="grand"&gt;Grand, Tamara. "Foraging site selection by juvenile coho salmon: ideal free distributions of unequal competitors." Animal Behavior. 53.1 (1997): 185-196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example, competition between [[sugarbeet root aphid]] stem mothers for galling sites on the leaves of ''[[Populus angustifolia]]'' has also been shown to generally follow the Ideal Free Distribution. After hatching in the spring, female aphids compete with each other for galling sites closest to the stems of the largest leaves. Both settling on a smaller leaf and sharing a leaf with another aphid reduce a stem mother's reproductive success, but the aphids settle in such a way that the average reproductive success for individuals on leaves with one, two, or three galls is the same. However, reproductive success is unequal within the same leaf, and stem mothers that settle closer to the base of the leaf have higher fitness than those that settle distally.&lt;ref name=Whitham1980&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitham|first=Thomas G.|title=The Theory of Habitat Selection: Examined and Extended Using Pemphigus Aphids|journal=The American Naturalist|date=April 1980|volume=115|issue=4|pages=449–466|jstor=2460478|doi=10.1086/283573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations in competitive abilities of individuals in a given population also tend to result in several different possible '''Nash equilibrium''' distributions that each maintains ideal free distribution. For example, if good competitors forage twice as well as poor competitors, a possible scenario upholding IFD would be for four good competitors and eight poor competitors to forage at a given site, each gaining the same net payoff per unit of competitive weight. Additional combinations upholding IFD could exist as well. Even when individuals move between patches in a suboptimal fashion, this distribution of possible equilibria is unaffected.&lt;ref name="rux"&gt;Ruxton, Graeme, and Stuart Humphries. "Multiple ideal free distributions of unequal competitors." Evolutionary Ecology Research. 1.5 (1999): 635-640.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortcomings==

Though the Ideal Free Distribution can be used to explain the behaviors of several species, it is not a perfect model. There remain many situations in which the IFD does not accurately predict the behavioral outcome.

===Deviation from the IFD===

As an optimal foraging model, the Ideal Free Distribution predicts that the ratio of individuals between two foraging sites will match the ratio of resources in those two sites. This prediction is similar to the [[Matching Law]] of individual choice, which states that an individual’s rate of response will be proportional to the positive reinforcement that individual receives for that response. So an animal will go to the patch that provides the most benefits to them.

However, this prediction assumes that each individual will act on its own. It does not hold for situations involving group choice, which is an example of social behavior. In 2001, Kraft et al. performed an experiment that tested the IFD’s predictions of group choice using humans.&lt;ref name="kraft"&gt;Kraft, J. R., Baum, W. M., &amp; Burge, M. J. (2002). Group choice and individual choices: modeling human social behavior with the ideal free distribution. Behavioural Processes, 57(2-3), 227-240. {{doi|10.1016/S0376-6357(02)00016-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment involved groups of participants choosing between blue and red cards in order to earn points towards prizes. When the groups’ choice of cards was graphed in relation to the ratios between the points, the slopes demonstrated some undermatching, which is a deviation from the Matching Law. Undermatching is the situation when the ratio of foragers between two patches (in this case, how many people picked each card) is less than the ratio of resources between the two patches (the points each card is worth). The results show that the IFD could not predict the outcome. However, they also show that it is possible to apply the Ideal Free Distribution to group choice, if that group choice is motivated by the individuals’ tendencies to maximize [[positive reinforcement]].

=== Experimental data not in support of IFD ===

It is important to keep in mind that IFD does rely on the assumptions previously stated and that all of these qualities are probably not met in the wild. Some believe that tests of IFD are not executed properly and therefore yield results that appear to follow the prediction but in reality do not.&lt;ref name="kenn"&gt;Kennedy, M., &amp; Gray, R. D. (1993). Can ecological theory predict the distribution of foraging animals? a critical analysis of experiments on the ideal free distribution. Oikos, 68(1), 158-166. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/3545322&lt;/ref&gt; This causes animal behaviorists to be split in opinions of whether IFD is a true phenomenon or not.

In experiments that test the predictions of IFD, most often there tends to be more individuals in the least profitable patch and a shortage at the richest patch. This distribution is found across species of insects, fish and birds. However, modifications to the original assumptions have been made and are implemented in experiments involving IFD.

One experiment&lt;ref name="man"&gt;Milinski, M. 1979. An evolutionarily stable feeding strategy in sticklebacks. Zietschrit fur Tierpsychologie 51: 36-40.&lt;/ref&gt; displayed this violation of IFD in stickleback fish. He saw that the actual observations and the ones stated by IFD were not congruent. More fish tended to disperse in the patch with less [[daphnia]] (the sought after food source) and the more abundant patch had a shortage of visitors. [[Cichlid fish]]&lt;ref name="mil"&gt;Godin, J.-G. &amp; Keenleyside, M.H.A. 1984. Foraging on patchily distributed prey by a chichlid fish (Teleostei Cichlidae): a test of the ideal free distribution theory. Animal Beaviour 32: 120-131.&lt;/ref&gt; also displayed the same subtle difference in predicted vs. actual dispersal numbers in relation to resources.

Kennedy and Gray&lt;ref name="kenn" /&gt; utilized the [[matching law]] in order to reanalyze IFD experiments. When psychologists perform tests of this law, they use more sensitive measures to account for deviation from strict matching relationships. Kennedy and Gray utilize this method to test the validity of previous IFD experiments. Using this analysis, they can account for under-matching when the distribution is less extreme than the resource rate. When one patch is seen to have more preference over another, bias in the resource ratio is taken into consideration. These two matching relationships are assessed by a regression of the log ratio of the numbers at each site against the log ratio of resources at the site.

The results they found do not support IFD predictions and some take this outcome to mean that the current model is too simple. Animal behaviorists have proposed a modification to the model that denotes an ultimate outcome of a population always having more individuals on the least profitable site and less on the more resource abundant site. Knowledge of the competitive interactions, effects of travel between sites, number of animals in population, perceptual abilities of these animals, and the relative and absolute resource availability on each patch is required to accurately predict the distribution of a foraging population.

The '''liquidus temperature''', T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; or T&lt;sub&gt;liq&lt;/sub&gt; specifies the temperature above which a material is completely liquid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Askeland |first1=Donald R. |last2=Wright |first2=Wendelin J. |title=Essentials of Materials Science and Engineering |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=January 14, 2014 |origyear=1st. Pub. 2009 |pages=329 |isbn=978-1-11157685-1 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the maximum temperature at which [[crystal]]s can co-exist with the melt in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. It is mostly used for impure substances (mixtures) such as  [[glass]]es, [[alloy]]s and [[rock (geology)|rock]]s.

Above the liquidus temperature the material is [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] and liquid at equilibrium. Below the liquidus temperature, more and more [[crystal]]s will form in the melt if one waits a sufficiently long time, depending on the material. Alternately, [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] glasses can be obtained through sufficiently fast cooling, i.e., through kinetic inhibition of the [[crystallization]] process.

The crystal phase that crystallizes first on cooling a substance to its liquidus temperature is termed '''primary crystalline phase''' or '''primary phase'''. The composition range within which the primary phase remains constant is known as '''primary crystalline phase field'''.

The liquidus temperature is important in the glass industry because crystallization can cause severe problems during the glass melting and forming processes, and it also may lead to product failure.

The liquidus temperature can be contrasted to the [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus temperature]]. The solidus temperature quantifies the point at which a material completely solidifies (crystallizes). The liquidus and solidus temperatures do not necessarily coincide; if a gap exists between the liquidus and solidus temperatures, then within that gap, the material consists of solid and liquid phases simultaneously (like a [[slurry]]).

For pure substances, e.g. pure metal, pure water, etc. the liquidus and solidus are at the same temperature, and the term "melting point" may be used. For impure substances, e.g. alloys, tap water, Coca-Cola, ice cream, etc. the melting point broadens into a melting interval instead. If the temperature is within the melting interval, one may see "slurries" at equilibrium, i.e. the slurry will neither fully solidify nor melt. This is why new snow of high purity either melts or stays solid, while dirty snow on the ground tends to become slushy at certain temperatures. Weld melt pools containing high levels of sulfur, either from melted impurities of the base metal or from the welding electrode, typically have very broad melting intervals, which leads to increased risk of hot cracking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4073">In [[statistics]], the '''Matérn covariance''' (named after the Swedish forestry statistician [[Bertil Matérn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = B. | last2 = McBratney|first2= A. B. | title = The Matérn function as a general model for soil variograms| last1 = Minasny| journal = Geoderma | volume = 128| issue = 3–4 | pages = 192–207 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.geoderma.2005.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[covariance function]] used in [[spatial statistics]], [[geostatistics]], [[machine learning]], image analysis, and other applications of multivariate statistical analysis on [[metric space]]s. It is commonly used to define the statistical covariance between measurements made at two points that are ''d'' units distant from each other. Since the covariance only depends on distances between points, it is [[stationary process|stationary]]. If the distance is [[Euclidean distance]], the Matérn covariance is also [[isotropic]].

== Definition ==
The Matérn covariance between two points separated by ''d'' distance units is given by &lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, Carl Edward and Williams, Christopher K. I. (2006) [http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW4.pdf Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
C_\nu(d) = \sigma^2\frac{2^{1-\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)}\Bigg(\sqrt{2\nu}\frac{d}{\rho}\Bigg)^\nu K_\nu\Bigg(\sqrt{2\nu}\frac{d}{\rho}\Bigg)
&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gamma function]], &lt;math&gt;K_\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the modified [[Bessel function]] of the second kind, and ρ and ν are non-negative [[parameter]]s of the covariance.

A [[Gaussian process]] with Matérn covariance has sample paths that are &lt;math&gt;\lceil \nu \rceil&lt;/math&gt; -1 times differentiable.&lt;ref name=R&gt;Santner, T. J., Williams, B. J., &amp; Notz, W. I. (2013). The design and analysis of computer experiments. Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simplification for specific values of ν ==

=== Simplification for ν half integer ===
When  &lt;math&gt;\nu = p+1/2,\ p\in \mathbb{N}^+&lt;/math&gt; , the '''Matérn covariance''' can be written as a product of an exponential and a polynomial of order &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables|last=Abramowitz and Stegun|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-486-61272-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math display="block"&gt;C_{p+1/2}(d) = \sigma^2\exp\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2p+1}d}{\rho}\right)\frac{p!}{(2p)!}\sum_{i=0}^p\frac{(p+i)!}{i!(p-i)!}\left(\frac{2\sqrt{2p+1}d}{\rho}\right)^{p-i},&lt;/math&gt;

which gives:
* for &lt;math&gt;\nu = 1/2\ (p=0)&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;C_{1/2}(d) = \sigma^2\exp\left(-\frac{d}{\rho}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
* for &lt;math&gt;\nu = 3/2\ (p=1)&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;C_{3/2}(d) = \sigma^2\left(1+\frac{\sqrt{3}d}{\rho}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}d}{\rho}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
* for &lt;math&gt;\nu = 5/2\ (p=2)&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;C_{5/2}(d) = \sigma^2\left(1+\frac{\sqrt{5}d}{\rho}+\frac{5d^2}{3\rho^2}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{\sqrt{5}d}{\rho}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The Gaussian case in the limit of infinite ν ===
As &lt;math&gt;\nu\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the '''Matérn covariance''' converges to the [[Covariance function|squared exponential covariance function]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{\nu\rightarrow\infty}C_\nu(d) = \sigma^2\exp\left(-\frac{d^2}{2\rho^2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;.

== Taylor series at zero and spectral moments ==
The behavior for &lt;math&gt;
d\rightarrow0
&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained by the following Taylor series:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
C_\nu(d) = \sigma^2\left(1 + \frac{\nu}{2(1-\nu)}\left(\frac{d}{\rho}\right)^2 + \frac{\nu^2}{8(2-3\nu+\nu^2)}\left(\frac{d}{\rho}\right)^4  + \mathcal{O}\left(d^5\right)\right)
.&lt;/math&gt;

When defined, the following spectral moments can be derived from the Taylor series:
* &lt;math&gt;
\lambda_0 = C_\nu(0) = \sigma^2
&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;
\lambda_2 = -\left.\frac{\partial^2C_\nu(d)}{\partial d^2}\right|_{d=0} = \frac{\sigma^2\nu}{\rho^2(\nu-1)}
&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3747">{{merge to|Dose–response relationship|date=October 2017}}
In statistics, in particular in the [[design of experiments]], a '''multi-valued treatment''' is a treatment that can take on more than two values. It is related to the [[Dose–response relationship|dose-response model]] in the medical literature. Generally speaking, treatment levels may be finite or infinite as well as ordinal or cardinal, which leads to a large collection of possible treatment effects to be studied in applications.&lt;ref&gt;Cattaneo, M. D. (2010): Multi-valued Treatment Effects. Encyclopedia of Research Design, ed. By N. J. Salkind, Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the effect of different levels of program participation (e.g. full-time and part-time) in a job training program.&lt;ref&gt;Wooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assume there exists a finite collection of multi-valued treatment status &lt;math&gt;T=\{0,1,2,\ldots,J,\}&lt;/math&gt; with J some fixed integer. As in the potential outcomes framework, denote  &lt;math&gt;Y (j) \subset R&lt;/math&gt; the collection of potential outcomes under the treatment ''J'', and &lt;math&gt;Y=\textstyle \sum_{j=0}^J \displaystyle D_j Y(j)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the observed outcome and &lt;math&gt;D_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is an indicator that equals '''1''' when the treatment equals ''j'' and '''0''' when it does not equal '''''j''''', leading to a fundamental problem of causal inference.&lt;ref&gt;Cattaneo, M. D. (2010): Efficient Semiparametric Estimation of Multi-Valued Treatment Effects under Ignorability. Journal of Econometrics 155(2), pp. 138–154.&lt;/ref&gt;  A general framework that analyzes ordered choice models in terms of marginal treatment effects and average treatment effects has been extensively discussed by Heckman and Vytlacil.&lt;ref&gt;Heckman, J. J., and E. J. Vytlacil (2007): Econometric Evaluation of Social Programs, Part II: Using the Marginal Treatment Effect to Organize Alternative Econometric Estimators to Evaluate Social Programs, and to Forecast the Effects in New Environments. Handbook of Econometrics, Vol 6, ed. by J. J. Heckman and E. E. Leamer. North Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work in the econometrics and statistics literature has focused on estimation and inference for multivalued treatments and ignorability conditions for identifying the treatment effects. In the context of program evaluation, the propensity score has been generalized to allow for multi-valued treatments,&lt;ref&gt;Imbens, G. (2000): The Role of the Propensity Score in Estimating Dose-Response Functions. Biometrika 87(3), pp. 706–710.&lt;/ref&gt; while other work has also focused on the role of the conditional mean independence assumption.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, M. (2001): Identification and Estimation of Causal Effects of Multiple Treatments under the Conditional Independence Assumption. Econometric Evaluation of Labour Market Policies, ed. by M. Lechner and F. Pfeiffer, pp. 43–58. Physica/Springer, Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other recent work has focused more on the large sample properties of an estimator of the marginal mean treatment effect conditional on a treatment level in the context of a difference-in-differences model,&lt;ref&gt;Abadie, A. (2005): Semiparametric Difference-in-Differences Estimators. Review of Economic Studies 72(1), pp. 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the efficient estimation of multi-valued treatment effects in a semiparametric framework.&lt;ref&gt;Cattaneo, M. D. (2010): Efficient Semiparametric Estimation of Multi-Valued Treatment Effects under Ignorability. Journal of Econometrics 155(2), pp. 138–154&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natural language processing''' ('''NLP''') is a subfield of [[computer science]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], and [[artificial intelligence]] concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of [[natural language]] data.

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve [[speech recognition]], [[natural language understanding]], and [[natural language generation]].

==History==

The [[history of natural language processing]] generally started in the 1950s, although work can be found from earlier periods.
In 1950, [[Alan Turing]] published an article titled "[[Intelligence]]" which proposed what is now called the [[Turing test]] as a criterion of intelligence.

The [[Georgetown-IBM experiment|Georgetown experiment]] in 1954 involved fully [[automatic translation]] of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hutchins, J.|year=2005|url=http://ahs.annaisd.org/common/pages/GalleryPhoto.aspx?photoId=11772950&amp;width=180&amp;height=180|title=The history of machine translation in a nutshell}}{{self-published source|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, real progress was much slower, and after the [[ALPAC|ALPAC report]] in 1966, which found that ten-year-long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced.  Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s, when the first [[statistical machine translation]] systems were developed.

Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were [[SHRDLU]], a natural language system working in restricted "[[blocks world]]s" with restricted vocabularies, and [[ELIZA]], a simulation of a [[Rogerian psychotherapy|Rogerian psychotherapist]], written by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] between 1964 and 1966.  Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. When the "patient" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to "My head hurts" with "Why do you say your head hurts?".

During the 1970s, many programmers began to write "conceptual [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]]", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data.  Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).  During this time, many [[chatterbots]] were written including [[PARRY]], [[Racter]], and [[Jabberwacky]].

Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.  Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of [[machine learning]] algorithms for language processing.  This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see [[Moore's law]]) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] theories of linguistics (e.g. [[transformational grammar]]), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of [[corpus linguistics]] that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.&lt;ref&gt;Chomskyan linguistics encourages the investigation of "[[corner case]]s" that stress the limits of its theoretical models (comparable to [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] phenomena in mathematics), typically created using [[thought experiment]]s, rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in real-world data, as is the case in [[corpus linguistics]].  The creation and use of such [[text corpus|corpora]] of real-world data is a fundamental part of machine-learning algorithms for natural language processing.  In addition, theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the so-called "[[poverty of the stimulus]]" argument entail that general learning algorithms, as are typically used in machine learning, cannot be successful in language processing.  As a result, the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as [[decision tree]]s, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules.  However, [[Part of speech tagging|part-of-speech tagging]] introduced the use of [[hidden Markov models]] to natural language processing, and increasingly, research has focused on [[statistical models]], which make soft, [[probabilistic]] decisions based on attaching [[real-valued]] weights to the features making up the input data. The [[cache language model]]s upon which many [[speech recognition]] systems now rely are examples of such statistical models.  Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks.

Many of the notable early successes occurred in the field of [[machine translation]], due especially to work at IBM Research, where successively more complicated statistical models were developed.  These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual [[text corpus|textual corpora]] that had been produced by the [[Parliament of Canada]] and the [[European Union]] as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government.  However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems. As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.

Recent research has increasingly focused on [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] and [[semi-supervised learning]] algorithms.  Such algorithms are able to learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers, or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data.  Generally, this task is much more difficult than [[supervised learning]], and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data.  However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the [[World Wide Web]]), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough [[time complexity]] to be practical.

In the 2010s, [[representation learning]] and [[deep learning|deep neural network]]-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing, due in part to a flurry of results showing that such techniques&lt;ref name=goldberg:nnlp17&gt;Goldberg, Yoav (2016). [https://www.jair.org/media/4992/live-4992-9623-jair.pdf A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing]. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 57 (2016) 345–420 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goodfellow:book16&gt;Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. http://www.deeplearningbook.org/ Deep Learning].  MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, for example in language modeling,&lt;ref name=jozefowicz:lm16&gt;Rafal Jozefowicz, Oriol Vinyals, Mike Schuster, Noam Shazeer, and Yonghui Wu (2016). https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02410 Exploring the Limits of Language Modeling&lt;/ref&gt;
parsing,&lt;ref name=choe:emnlp16&gt;Do Kook Choe and Eugene Charniak (EMNLP 2016). https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/D16-1257/d16-1257 Parsing as Language Modeling&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vinyals:nips15"&gt;Vinyals, Oriol, et al. (NIPS2015). https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5635-grammar-as-a-foreign-language.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Popular techniques include the use of [[word embedding]]s to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing). In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing. For instance, the term ''[[neural machine translation]]'' (NMT) emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence-to-sequence transformations, obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that were used in [[statistical machine translation]] (SMT).

==Rule-based vs. statistical NLP==
In the early days, many language-processing systems were designed by hand-coding a set of rules,&lt;ref name=winograd:shrdlu71&gt;Winograd, Terry (1971). Procedures as a Representation for Data in a Computer Program for Understanding Natural Language. http://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/shrdlu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schank77&gt;Roger C. Schank and Robert P. Abelson (1977). Scripts, plans, goals, and understanding: An inquiry into human knowledge structures&lt;/ref&gt;, e.g. by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for [[stemming]].
However, this is rarely robust to natural language variation. 

Since the so-called "statistical revolution"&lt;ref name=johnson:eacl:ilcl09&gt;[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-0103 Mark Johnson. How the statistical revolution changes (computational) linguistics.] Proceedings of the EACL 2009 Workshop on the Interaction between Linguistics and Computational Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resnik:langlog11&gt;[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2946 Philip Resnik. Four revolutions.] Language Log, February 5, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;
in the late 1980s and mid 1990s, much natural language processing research has relied heavily on [[machine learning]].

The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using [[statistical inference]] to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large ''[[text corpus|corpora]]'' of typical real-world examples (a ''corpus'' (plural, "corpora") is a set of documents, possibly with human or computer annotations).

Many different classes of machine-learning algorithms have been applied to natural-language-processing tasks. These algorithms take as input a large set of "features" that are generated from the input data. Some of the earliest-used algorithms, such as [[decision tree]]s, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to the systems of hand-written rules that were then common. Increasingly, however, research has focused on [[statistical models]], which make soft, [[probabilistic]] decisions based on attaching [[real-valued]] weights to each input feature. Such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one, producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system.

Systems based on machine-learning algorithms have many advantages over hand-produced rules:
*The learning procedures used during machine learning automatically focus on the most common cases, whereas when writing rules by hand it is often not at all obvious where the effort should be directed.
*Automatic learning procedures can make use of statistical-inference algorithms to produce models that are robust to unfamiliar input (e.g. containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and to erroneous input (e.g. with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted). Generally, handling such input gracefully with hand-written rules—or, more generally, creating systems of hand-written rules that make soft decisions—is extremely difficult, error-prone and time-consuming.
*Systems based on automatically learning the rules can be made more accurate simply by supplying more input data. However, systems based on hand-written rules can only be made more accurate by increasing the complexity of the rules, which is a much more difficult task.  In particular, there is a limit to the complexity of systems based on hand-crafted rules, beyond which the systems become more and more unmanageable.  However, creating more data to input to machine-learning systems simply requires a corresponding increase in the number of man-hours worked, generally without significant increases in the complexity of the annotation process.

==Major evaluations and tasks==
The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing.  Note that some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.

Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they are frequently subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.

===Syntax===
; [[Grammar induction]]&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Dan, and Christopher D. Manning. "[http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1945-natural-language-grammar-induction-using-a-constituent-context-model.pdf Natural language grammar induction using a constituent-context model]." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;: Generate a [[formal grammar]] that describes a language's syntax.
; [[Lemmatisation|Lemmatization]]: The task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma.
; [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphological segmentation]]: Separate words into individual [[morpheme]]s and identify the class of the morphemes.  The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (i.e. the structure of words) of the language being considered. [[English language|English]] has fairly simple morphology, especially [[inflectional morphology]], and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g. "open, opens, opened, opening") as separate words.  In languages such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or [[Meitei language|Meitei]],&lt;ref&gt;Kishorjit, N., Vidya Raj RK., Nirmal Y., and Sivaji B. (2012) "[http://aclweb.org/anthology//W/W12/W12-5008.pdf Manipuri Morpheme Identification]", Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on South and Southeast Asian Natural Language Processing (SANLP), pages 95–108, COLING 2012, Mumbai, December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a highly [[Agglutination|agglutinated]] Indian language, however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms.
; [[Part-of-speech tagging]]: Given a sentence, determine the [[part of speech]] for each word.  Many words, especially common ones, can serve as multiple [[parts of speech]].  For example, "book" can be a [[noun]] ("the book on the table") or [[verb]] ("to book a flight"); "set" can be a [[noun]], [[verb]] or [[adjective]]; and "out" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.  Some languages have more such ambiguity than others.{{dubious|date=June 2018}}  Languages with little [[inflectional morphology]], such as [[English language|English]], are particularly prone to such ambiguity. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] is prone to such ambiguity because it is a [[tonal language]] during verbalization. Such inflection is not readily conveyed via the entities employed within the orthography to convey intended meaning.
; [[Parsing]]: (see also: [[Stochastic grammar]]) Determine the [[parse tree]] (grammatical analysis) of a given sentence.  The [[grammar]] for [[natural language]]s is [[ambiguous]] and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses.  In fact, perhaps surprisingly, for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses (most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human). There are two primary types of parsing, Dependency Parsing and Constituency Parsing. Dependency Parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence (marking things like Primary Objects and predicates), whereas Constituency Parsing focuses on building out the Parse Tree using a [[Probabilistic_context-free_grammar|Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar]] (PCFG). 
; [[Sentence breaking]] (also known as [[sentence boundary disambiguation]]): Given a chunk of text, find the sentence boundaries.  Sentence boundaries are often marked by [[Full stop|period]]s or other [[punctuation mark]]s, but these same characters can serve other purposes (e.g. marking [[abbreviation]]s).
; [[Stemming]]
; [[Word segmentation]]:Separate a chunk of continuous text into separate words.  For a language like [[English language|English]], this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces.  However, some written languages like [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Thai language|Thai]] do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion, and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the [[vocabulary]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of words in the language. Sometimes this process is also used in cases like Bag of Words (BOW) creation in data mining.
; [[Terminology extraction]]: The goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus.

===Semantics===
; [[Lexical semantics]]: What is the computational meaning of individual words in context?
; [[Machine translation]]: Automatically translate text from one human language to another.  This is one of the most difficult problems, and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed "[[AI-complete]]", i.e. requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts about the real world, etc.) in order to solve properly.
; [[Named entity recognition]] (NER): Given a stream of text, determine which items in the text map to proper names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is (e.g. person, location, organization).  Note that, although [[capitalization]] can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity, and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient.  For example, the first word of a sentence is also capitalized, and named entities often span several words, only some of which are capitalized.  Furthermore, many other languages in non-Western scripts (e.g. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) do not have any capitalization at all, and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names. For example, [[German language|German]] capitalizes all [[noun]]s, regardless of whether they are names, and [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] do not capitalize names that serve as [[adjective]]s.
; [[Natural language generation]]: Convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language.
; [[Natural language understanding]]: Convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as [[first-order logic]] structures that are easier for [[computer]] programs to manipulate. Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts. Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions. An explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as [[closed-world assumption]] (CWA) vs. [[open-world assumption]], or subjective Yes/No vs. objective True/False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization.&lt;ref&gt;Yucong Duan, Christophe Cruz (2011), ''[http://www.ijimt.org/abstract/100-E00187.htm Formalizing Semantic of Natural Language through Conceptualization from Existence]''. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009135952/http://www.ijimt.org/abstract/100-E00187.htm |date=2011-10-09 }} International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology(2011) 2 (1), pp. 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR): Given an image representing printed text, determine the corresponding text.
; [[Question answering]]: Given a human-language question, determine its answer.  Typical questions have a specific right answer (such as "What is the capital of Canada?"), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as "What is the meaning of life?"). Recent works have looked at even more complex questions.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis]", Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119-142, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Textual entailment|Recognizing Textual entailment]]: Given two text fragments, determine if one being true entails the other, entails the other's negation, or allows the other to be either true or false.&lt;ref name=rte:11&gt; PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge (RTE-7) https://tac.nist.gov//2011/RTE/ &lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Relationship extraction]]: Given a chunk of text, identify the relationships among named entities (e.g. who is married to whom).
; [[Sentiment analysis]] (see also [[multimodal sentiment analysis]]): Extract subjective information usually from a set of documents, often using online reviews to determine "polarity" about specific objects. It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in the social media, for the purpose of marketing.
; [[Topic segmentation]] and recognition: Given a chunk of text, separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic, and identify the topic of the segment.
; [[Word sense disambiguation]]: Many words have more than one [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]; we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context.  For this problem, we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses, e.g. from a dictionary or from an online resource such as [[WordNet]].

===Discourse===
; [[Automatic summarization]]: Produce a readable summary of a chunk of text.  Often used to provide summaries of text of a known type, such as articles in the financial section of a newspaper.
; [[Coreference|Coreference resolution]]: Given a sentence or larger chunk of text, determine which words ("mentions") refer to the same objects ("entities"). [[Anaphora resolution]] is a specific example of this task, and is specifically concerned with matching up [[pronoun]]s with the nouns or names to which they refer. The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so-called "bridging relationships" involving [[referring expression]]s. For example, in a sentence such as "He entered John's house through the front door", "the front door" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to).
; [[Discourse analysis]]: This rubric includes a number of related tasks.  One task is identifying the [[discourse]] structure of connected text, i.e. the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences (e.g. elaboration, explanation, contrast).  Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the [[speech act]]s in a chunk of text (e.g. yes-no question, content question, statement, assertion, etc.).

===Speech===
; [[Speech recognition]]: Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech.  This is the opposite of [[text to speech]] and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed "[[AI-complete]]" (see above).  In [[natural speech]] there are hardly any pauses between successive words, and thus [[speech segmentation]] is a necessary subtask of speech recognition (see below).  Note also that in most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed [[coarticulation]], so the conversion of the [[analog signal]] to discrete characters can be a very difficult process.
; [[Speech segmentation]]: Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, separate it into words.  A subtask of [[speech recognition]] and typically grouped with it.
; [[Text-to-speech]]:Given a text, transform those units and produce a spoken representation. Text-to-speech can be used to aid the visually impaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Yi|first=Chucai|title=Assistive Text Reading from Complex Background for Blind Persons|date=2012|work=Camera-Based Document Analysis and Recognition|pages=15–28|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-29364-1_2|isbn=9783642293634|last2=Tian|first2=Yingli|citeseerx=10.1.1.668.869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Humanism}}
'''Neohumanism''' is a [[Holism|holistic]] [[philosophical theory]] proposed by [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] to promote [[individual]] and [[collective]] progress. In this philosophy [[universalism]] plays a central role. It claims to elevate humanism to level of universalism.&lt;ref name=dis1&gt;''When the underlying spirit of humanism is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this universe – I have designated this as "neohumanism". This neohumanism will elevate humanism to universalism, the cult of love for all created beings of this universe.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism (Discourse 1)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It claims not to have any grouping intention.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==History==
Sarkar detailed Neohumanism in his 1982 book ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''.{{r|dis1}}

In 1987, Sarkar published ''Neohumanism in a Nutshell'' (parts 1 and 2). They contain more discourses on Neohumanism, from various times that he discussed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=33&amp;mode=addtocart|title=Neo- Humanism in a Nutshell - 1|publisher=Ananda Marga|accessdate=15 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093145/http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=33&amp;mode=addtocart|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=34|title=Neo- Humanism in a Nutshell - 2|publisher=Ananda Marga|accessdate=15 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101630/http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=34|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Neohumanism has three stages of development.&lt;ref name="Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan 1982"&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Neohumanism Is the Ultimate Shelter (Discourse 11)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first stage of Neohumanism is spiritual practice to enhance the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of the practitioner. The stage of spiritual practice indirectly benefits society through the social service that is part of spiritual practice.
* The second stage of Neohumanism is spiritual principle (or essence). Its impact is mainly in the mental and spiritual realms, both individual and collective. According to Neohumanism, practice of [[#Rationality|rationality]] and adherence to the [[#Social equality|principle of social equality]] (especially when combined with [[#Protopsychospirituality|protospiritualistic mentality]]) will not only strengthen individual minds but also the collective human mind to the point that humanity as a whole can withstand the destructive impact of [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiment]] and the ruthless exploiters who capitalize on those sentiments.
* {{anchor|stage3}}The third and final stage of Neohumanism is spiritual mission. According to Neohumanism, when an individual's existential nucleus (soul) merges with the "Cosmic Existential Nucleus", she/he attains the consummation of her/his existence. Neohumanism asserts that this supreme status ensures the future of not only the human world but also of the animal and plant worlds as well.

== Concepts ==
List of Neohumanism's key concepts in alphabetical order.

=== Devotion ===
According to neohumanism, love for the Supreme (devotion) is the highest and most valuable treasure of humanity. It automatically results in [[#Universalism|universalism]]. However, neohumanism deems devotion to be a very tender inner asset, frequently assailed by materialism and other onslaughts from the external world. To preserve this treasure, Sarkar submits neohumanism as a practical philosophy that provides a protective fence for devotion by (1) establishing harmony between the spiritual and material worlds (2) providing perennial inspiration for the onward march of society.{{r|dis1}}

=== Dogma ===
Neohumanism defines [[dogma]] as a mental prison. In other words, a dogma is any concept (belief) that one is expected to accept without question. Neohumanism perceives such conduct as fundamentally contrary to [[#Humanity|human nature]], which includes a constant quest for mental expansion. Hence, the position of neohumanism on dogma is that all dogma must be eradicated.&lt;ref name=dis2&gt;''The snares of dogma will have to be shattered to pieces; the iron prison gates of dogma will have to be crushed to dust.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Bondages and Solutions (Discourse 2)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploitation ===
Neohumanism discourages both [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiment]], because both tend to be injurious to society. However, neohumanism observes that, of the two, sociosentiment is more pernicious. Under the influence of sociosentiment, one group of people are driven to exploit a second group of people, that second group of people are driven to exploit a third group of people, and so on.&lt;ref name=dis7&gt;''Now, in sociosentiment, it happens that a certain group exploits another, and that exploited group in turn exploits a third.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Neohumanism, there are many types of exploitation, but exploitation always tends to come down to the economic plane. Economic exploitation manifests itself in two forms:
* '''Politico-economic exploitation''' occurs when an [[Imperialism|imperialist]] nation or group engages in economic exploitation through the use of brute force to impose direct political control over another nation or group. For example, under the [[British Empire]], the United Kingdom variously ruled the nations it conquered through three political mechanisms: [[wikt:direct rule|direct rule]], [[viceroy]]s, and [[Governor-General|governor-generals]].
* {{anchor|psycho-economic_exploitation}}'''Psycho-economic exploitation''' occurs when direct political control is not or is no longer feasible (often due to [[military logistics]]). At such times, the imperialist nation or group engages in economic exploitation by injecting fear and inferiority complexes in the minds of the people that they would [[Colonialism|colonize]].

A common name for psycho-economic exploitation is [[neocolonialism]]. However, Neohumanism observes that there is nothing new about psycho-economic exploitation. Wherever politico-economic exploitation takes place, it is invariably accompanied by psychic exploitation, the goal of which being to make the colonized people more docile. In other words, according to Neohumanism, in both politico-economic exploitation and psycho-economic exploitation, psychic exploitation is the foundation.{{r|dis7}} Neohumanism asserts that when politico-economic exploitation is combined with psycho-economic exploitation, the likely social devastation is much greater.{{r|dis7}}

==== Exploiters ====
In nature, there is a [[mainstream]], and there is also positive and negative deviation from the mainstream. This is true for all species of living beings. Neohumanism classifies this deviation for plants, animals, and humans. When a living being substantially deviates from the mainstream in a constructive fashion, neohumanism describes that being as ''remarkable'', ''good'', or ''blissful'' (depending on whether the structure of that being is of a plant, animal, or human respectively). Conversely, when a living being substantially deviates from the mainstream in a destructive fashion, neohumanism describes that being as ''notorious'', ''bad'', or ''demonic'' (depending on whether the structure of that being is of a plant, animal, or human respectively).{{r|dis10}} In respect to exploitation, our main concern is with human structures, specifically those human structures with [[genius]] that is exercised for destructive purpose, ''demons in human form/framework'' (DHFs).

DHFs are geniuses, and so they are exceptionally devious. They know how to pander to and play on the [[#Geosentiment|geosentiments]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiments]] of the common people, who rarely think deeply. But truth does not remain hidden forever. So whenever a particular abuse of geosentiment or sociosentiment is about to get exposed or that particular geosentiment or sociosentiment is likely to lose popularity, DHFs switch to a different sentiment. Neohumanism designates the adaptive art of conveniently switching sentiments as ''metamorphosed sentimental strategy''.{{r|dis10}}

According to neohumanism, DHFs wreak great havoc upon this world.{{r|dis10}} Because of their adeptness at metamorphosed sentimental strategy, Sarkar also sometimes refers to DHFs as ''human chameleons''. Like chameleons, DHFs are often very difficult to spot. Nevertheless, Sarkar insists that it is the duty of all neohumanists to identify the DHFs. Not only must neohumanists identify the DHFs, but they must also expose them.{{r|dis10}}

=== Humanism (general) ===
According to neohumanism, the radius of geosentiment and sociosentiment may be relatively short or long. In other words, they both have a minimal and maximal expression (geosentiment or sociosentiment ''minimitis'' and ''maximitis''). With respect to sociosentiment, its minimal expression (''sociosentiment minimitis'') is the attraction felt toward one's nuclear family. That minimal sociosentiment may be extended to embrace a larger community, for example, a city, a state, a nation, an ethnicity, a religious group, and so on. When sociosentiment extends beyond [[nationalism]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], theoretically embracing all human beings, that is ''sociosentiment maximitis''. According to Sarkar, general (or ordinary) humanism is essentially '''sociosentiment maximitis'''.&lt;ref name="Now 1982"&gt;''Now, this sociosentiment, in its stage of excellencio or in theory maximitis, is called "humanism." Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Pseudohumanism (Discourse 8)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pseudohumanism ====
Neohumanism is of the view that general or ordinary humanism is a distorted humanism that has done and is still doing harm in the world. According to neohumanism, in so far as humanism expanded sociosentiment, it was a positive trend; but in so far as it sets limits on the expansion of the underlying spirit of humanism, [[love]], it has been and continues to be counterproductive.

According to neohumanism, there is a tendency for general humanists to substitute [[pity]] for love. Sarkar said this type of '''pseudohumanism''' inevitably fosters '''intra-human conflict'''.

=== Humanity ===
Neohumanism rejects the classic definition of human being as "[[rational animal]]", which first appeared in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' insisting that human beings have characteristics distinct from [[animal]]s. It considers human [[life]] to be an [[Ideology|ideological]] flow,{{subst:technical language}} characterized by identification with and commitment to an ideology.&lt;ref name=glory&gt;Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, "The Glory of Human Dharma", 21 February 1979, Bhopal. Published in ''Ananda Vacanamrtam Part 8'', Ananda Marga Publications, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inspiration (motivation) ===
According to neohumanism, the impetus (inspiration or motivation) for human movement - human dynamism - may be either of two conflicting [[principle]]s: the principle of selfish pleasure (''átma-sukha tattva'') or the principle of social equality (''sama-samája tattva'').

==== Selfish pleasure ====
According to neohumanism, selfishness is a socially divisive mental ailment. Those who promote or accept the [[#Dogma|dogmas]] founded on the principle of selfish pleasure typically do so in order to secure their own vested interests.&lt;ref&gt;''All the social, economic and geographical forces that normally motivate human beings are guided by dogma; and this dogma in its turn is entirely based on átma-sukha tattva [the principle of selfish pleasure]. Human beings yield to this dogma with the sole intention of attaining selfish pleasures; even educated people knowingly submit to dogma.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Sama-Samája Tattva (Discourse 6)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social equality ====
The concept of [[egalitarianism]] has been in circulation for thousands of years. Over time, the concept has become broader and more sophisticated. Recently, various studies have been conducted with results that endorse the tremendous importance of having a more equitable society (see, for example, ''[[The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better]]'' by [[Richard G. Wilkinson]] and [[Kate Pickett]]). Neohumanism promotes egalitarianism by asserting the principle of social equality and rejecting all [[#Dogma|dogma]] and [[superstition]].&lt;ref&gt;''The endeavor to advance towards the ultimate reality by forming a society free from all inequalities, with everyone of the human race moving in unison, is called sama-samája tattva [the principle of social equality]... We must totally reject all those hypocritical ideas which are contrary to this sama-samája tattva, and we must welcome all those ideas which will help human beings to be established in it. All opposing theories must be removed mercilessly, just like thorns from our path. And in this process we must not give indulgence to any dogmas or supernatural ideas. This should be the task of today’s human beings; all people should combine their efforts and strive unitedly to accomplish that end.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Sama-Samája Tattva (Discourse 6)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to neohumanism, realization of the principle of social equality is a natural consequence of spiritual practice (especially meditation founded on yogic [[morality]], '''Yama-Niyama'''&lt;ref&gt;Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, ''A Guide to Human Conduct''. Fourth Paperback Edition, 2004, Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|9788172521035}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, realization of this principle is not the final stage of neohumanism, because application of a principle is somewhat mechanical. In the final stage of neohumanism, the human being's life is transformed into a blissful mission of love (see the [[#stage3|third stage of neohumanism]]).

=== Internationalism ===
Many general humanists support the concept of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]. Neohumanism observes that internationalism does not even rise to the standard of [[#Humanism (general)|ordinary humanism]]. Indeed, it poses the same sort of risk to global peace as nationalism. Sarkar explains the problem as follows:

{{Quote|''Suppose I was working for a particular nation, but now I am working for all nations. When I admit the existence of nations and say that I am working for all nations, then it is neither humanism nor universalism – it is merely internationalism. When I use the term "internationalism", I am admitting the existence of separate nations, and along with this I must naturally also think, within the nations, of the people's five fundamental requirements of life (food, clothes, education, shelter, and medical care). But when I discover that one nation is trying to thrive on the life-blood of another, I oppose it, and this opposition ultimately leads to world war. So internationalism is not the solution either.''&lt;ref name="Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan 1982"/&gt;}}

From the perspective of neohumanism, the [[League of Nations]] could not prevent [[World War II]], and the [[United Nations]] cannot prevent a World War III. Only a [[world government]] could ensure peace on this planet.

=== Mental illness ===
According to neohumanism, the major cause of mental disorder is a lack of harmony between the rhythm and speed of the inner world and the outer world. In modern times, humanity has made great progress in the intellectual sphere. But, for most people, the speed of that intellectual progress is not well reflected in the external world (for example, a rising standard of living). Similarly, the patterns of thought for most persons (their internal psychic rhythm) is quite different from the external rhythm of the objective world. These disparities naturally cause clash, and that clash is felt even more in the psychic realm than the physical realm. Neohumanism asserts that this is the reason why many human beings lose their mental balance.{{r|dis1}}

=== Mental modes ===
According to neohumanism, in addition to various activities like [[Thought|thinking]] and [[Recall (memory)|remembering]], mind has three modes of functioning: ''[[instinct]]'', ''sentiment'', and ''[[rationality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Geo-Sentiment (Discourse 3)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anopheles stephensi.jpeg|thumb|200px|Mosquitoes suck blood instinctively.]]
* '''Instinct''': The position of neohumanism on ''[[instinct]]'' is somewhat [[Convention (norm)|conventional]]. All living beings, developed and undeveloped, have innate instincts. Many if not most such instincts incite behavior that increases the likelihood of [[self-preservation]] of an organism or a species. So, for example, mosquitoes suck blood, and human babies drink their mother's milk. Neohumanism takes note of the fact that life feeds on life,&lt;ref&gt;''It is true that living creatures are the food for other living beings (jiivah jiivasya bhojanam); and indeed, the vegetables that we eat every day also have living cells in them.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism (Discourse 1)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but insists that human beings must employ [[rationality]] in the selection of food.&lt;ref&gt;''Once I read in a certain book that a great saint used to live only on locusts dipped in honey. That saint did not seriously consider that those little locusts also had vital life force throbbing in them... This concern for the vital rhythm throbbing in other human creatures has driven people to the fold of humanism, has made them humanists. Now, if the same human sentiment is extended to include all creatures of this universe, then and only then can human existence be said to have attained its final consummation.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism (Discourse 1)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, neohumanism recognizes the fact that human beings are motivated to some extent by instinct, but neohumanism expects human beings to rely more on rationality so that any needlessly destructive impact of instinct (and sentiment) is curtailed.
* {{anchor|sentiment}}'''Sentiment''': Regarding ''sentiment'', neohumanism broadens the perspective. According to neohumanism, undeveloped minds operate only on instinct; whereas, in more developed minds (including human minds), sentiment also functions and tends to exceed instinct. Goaded by sentiment, mind runs blindly after what it likes (or away from what it does not like). A sentimental being does not ask questions about propriety or even employ common sense. Accordingly, sentiment poses the risk that an irrational course of action may be adopted - a course of action that could destroy not just the sentimental individual but also an entire family or social group.
* '''Discrimination''': Discrimination occurs when a conscious decision is taken regarding the appropriate course of action. A tiger stalks its prey and attacks from a selected vantage point. This is discrimination. A robber enters a house and calculates which room to plunder first, based on most likely gain. This is discrimination. A reasoned decision regarding pros and cons is taken. When discrimination goes one step further, considering a choice between right and wrong (proper and improper), then conscience ([[viveka]]) is invoked. At that point, discrimination rises to the level of [[#Rationality|rationality]]. Compared to instinct and sentiment, discrimination is a slow process. It takes more time to exercise discrimination.

=== Protopsychospirituality ===
Protopsychospirituality (also known as ''protospiritualistic mentality'') is a type of thinking whereby one remembers that everything and everyone with whom one comes in contact is a manifestation of Supreme Consciousness (''Parama Brahma''). Before and after doing any action, if one remembers that all existential phenomena emanate from and return to the Supreme (Cosmic) Existential Nucleus, a benevolent mode of thinking naturally arises within the mind. In that state of mind, one cannot contemplate doing harm to others. Neohumanism asserts that a protospiritualistic mentality is essential for identifying some exceptionally devious [[#Exploiters|exploiters]]. Identification becomes possible when the person with a protospiritualistic mentality notes that her/his benevolent mode of thinking is not reflected in the actions of the exploiter.{{r|dis10}}

=== Pseudoculture ===
[[Culture]] generally refers to the refinements in human expressions. Everyone eats. However, to eat only after washing one's hands is commonly deemed to be part of the ''culture'' of eating. According to neohumanism, human culture is one, but there are variations in its expression. For example, humans, being social creatures, typically like to communicate; but, depending on locality, different languages are used. Neohumanism observes that whenever one group of people has sought to economically exploit another group of people, the former group simultaneously attempted to destroy the local cultural expressions of the latter group. This has been done through the imposition of ''pseudoculture''. Examples of the imposition of pseudoculture are the forced acceptance of an imperialist ruler's language, religious dogma, style of dress, style of eating, political forms, historical perspectives, and artistic expressions.

Pseudoculture is imposed by various means from brute force to the mass media to public education. Often, the standard of refinement in pseudoculture is less than that which it replaces. But regardless of the standard of refinement, the end result is that the cultural backbone of the colonized society is broken. Psychologically crippled, the colonized people lose the will and the power to protest against exploitation. Instead, they tend to deem it just and proper to hand over much of their national wealth to the exploiters.&lt;ref&gt;''This exploitation in the cultural sphere is accomplished by the propagation of pseudoculture. Every honest, virtuous, rational person must fight against this pseudoculture, and inspire others to do the same. If this is not done, the future of humanity will be sealed. It is proper for human beings to struggle for political freedom, for social emancipation; but if their cultural backbone is broken, then all their struggles will end in nothing – like offering ghee into a fire that has died out.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rationality ===
Philosophers have defined [[rationality]] in various ways. Some of those definitions could equally apply to animals or even plants. Neohumanism offers a new and precise definition of rationality that calls for a standard of mentality that is not discernible in any species other than human beings. According to neohumanism, rationality (also known as ''rationalistic mentality'') is a three-stage process of discrimination that begins with adequate study to assimilate all relevant facts, proceeds to analyze the pros and cons of an action, and ends with a decision in favor of only a ''blissful auxiliary'' (practical action that furthers the welfare of all).&lt;ref&gt;''In the first stage you study; in the second you analyze the positive and negative sides; and in the third stage you arrive at "blissful or non-blissful, auxiliary or non-auxiliary". When you complete this whole process of logical reasoning, the outcome is your "awakened conscience". This state of awakened conscience is what is called "rationalistic mentality".'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Awakened Conscience (Discourse 9)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=''So in the sphere of religion also, if you look carefully, you will see that behind those who have been knowingly or unknowingly operating the machinery of exploitation, there are certain wealthy parties. Those parties want to create their satellites. In every sphere of life you will find such wealthy people in the background.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar}}
Throughout history, [[religion]] has had a domineering influence on the human mind. According to neohumanism, all religions are based on [[#Dogma|dogma]], and the propagation of that religious dogma has been instrumental in the creation of satellite groups. Some religious persons and priests propagate the damaging dogma of religion unwittingly. When such persons are made to understand their mistake, some admit their error and rectify themselves. Others, however, refuse to do so, fearing that the admission of error would injure their prestige. The latter group of persons thereby join the ranks of conscious agents of injustice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Geosentiment.jpg|thumb|Degrees of geosentiment (simplified expansions)]]

=== Sentiments ===
According to neohumanism, two types of sentiment are common to human beings (in both an individual and collective sense): [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Bondages and Solutions (Discourse 2)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both sentiments have a minimal and a maximal expression (geosentiment or sociosentiment ''minimitis'' and ''maximitis''). As with any [[#sentiment|sentiment]], both geosentiment and sociosentiment may have good uses, but there is also great risk of harm (harm to others and harm to oneself). Neohumanism observes that those who would exploit other human beings for their own selfish gain ([[#Exploiters|exploiters]]) typically employ these two types of sentiment, often shifting or transforming sentiments whenever convenient.

==== Geosentiment ====
Geosentiment is the attraction felt toward one's own home, city, or country. Its minimal expression (''geosentiment minimitis'') is love for one's home (house, homestead, or the like). The maximal expression of geosentiment (''geosentiment maximitis'') is love for one's country. In theory, one might feel love for the entire planet, but today such an expression of geosentiment would be very rare, possibly non-existent. In the future, when interplanetary travel becomes commonplace, geosentiment maximitis may expand.

Geosentiment presents in many forms: [[geopolitics]], [[geoeconomics]], geopatriotism, georeligion, and so on. For example, georeligion would associate a religion or a religious group with a specific territory. So, the belief that God has granted a particular territory to a particular group of people is an example of georeligion. Similarly, the belief that prayer must be carried out facing in a specific direction is another expression of georeligion. Such type of beliefs (geosentiments) may prove harmless or harmful, depending on circumstances. According to neohumanism, the potential for harm in geosentiment can be curbed through the cultivation of a [[#Rationality|rationalistic mentality]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Geosentiment (Discourse 3)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sociosentiment.jpg|thumb|Degrees of sociosentiment (simplified expansions)]]

==== Sociosentiment ====
Sociosentiment is the attraction felt toward one's own family, nation, or other social grouping (linguistic, religious, political, and so on). Its minimal expression (''sociosentiment minimitis'') is the attraction felt toward one's nuclear family. That minimal sociosentiment may be extended to embrace a larger community, for example, a city, a state, a nation, an ethnicity, a religious group, and so on. When sociosentiment extends beyond [[nationalism]] and [[#Internationalism|internationalism]], theoretically embracing all human beings, that is ''sociosentiment maximitis''. According to Sarkar, [[#Humanism (general)|general (or ordinary) humanism]] is essentially sociosentiment maximitis.&lt;ref name="Now 1982"/&gt;

Sociosentiment presents itself in many forms: [[Political sociology|sociopolitics]], [[socioeconomics]], [[Patriotism|sociopatriotism]], [[Sociology of religion|socioreligion]], and so on. For example, sociopatriotism might express itself as [[jingoism]] with declarations like "my country, right or wrong" or "my country over all others". Socioeconomics might express itself in the form of an imperialist attempt to create [[Colony|colonies]] or [[satellite states]].

Compared to [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]], sociosentiment has the capacity to do - and has done - much greater harm in the world. Sociosentiment can also be more difficult to recognize. As such, [[#Rationality|rationality]] might not be adequate to offset the dangers of sociosentiment. To overcome sociosentiment, neohumanism prescribes an additional tool, [[#Protopsychospirituality|protopsychospirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;''What is the way to counteract this sociosentiment? The only way to eliminate it is to develop protospiritualistic mentality. The basis of this protospiritualistic mentality is sama-samája tattva [the principle of social equality]. When people understand this principle from the core of their hearts, they spontaneously develop protospiritualistic mentality, protospiritualistic psychic structure.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Bondages and Solutions (Discourse 2)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social justice ===
Neohumanism extends the concept of ''society'' to include all living beings. Unlike most other theories, past or present, neohumanism distinguishes between [[human society]] and society (in its broadest or universal sense).

In respect to the universal society, the stance of neohumanism corresponds to the spirit of the third fundamental principle of [[Progressive Utilization Theory|PROUT]]. The physical, mental, and spiritual potential of each and every living being should be developed to the maximum. This means that humans should not only respect and protect the rights of the non-human creatures but also actively promote their welfare and happiness.

Regarding human society, neohumanism asserts that no one should be left to lag behind. In a healthy human society, no one should suffer from [[oppression]]. Every problem - big or small, individual or collective - should be taken as a problem of the entire humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''Spread out the sermons of amity amongst the humanity. Remind one and all that the establishment of human excellence does not lie in hypocrisy but in simplicity and sincerity. Make them all realize that every individual human problem, whether big or small, is the problem of universal humanity. Make them also understand that the origin as well as the finality of the entire humanity is one and the same.'' Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 1982 January 1. Ánanda Váńii Saḿgraha. Compilation from 1956-1990, Ananda Marga Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, neohumanism is claimed to oppose any form of [[social discrimination]] based on race or sex, and support women's rights. Neohumanism makes men responsible for acting in support of those rights.&lt;ref&gt;''In every sphere of life men have either substantially limited the rights of women, or made the ability of women to exercise their rights subject to the whims and caprices of men... The main point of the discussion is this: those who take advantage of people’s simplicity or ignorance are veritable demons in human form, and those who deceive people by exploiting their sentiments of sacrifice are even worse than demons... If at all a movement is required, it must be implemented by men themselves. Today men should consider the needs of women and gradually restore to women the rights which women once entrusted to men out of feelings of helplessness or in response to their heartfelt sentiments.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1959). ''Human Society Part 1''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-120-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concern of neohumanism for [[social justice]] extends even to relatively minor but intractable matters. So, for example, though it pertains only to grammar, the male bias of the English language should not continue. When the pronoun 'he' can mean 'he' or 'she' and when 'man' can mean 'man' or 'woman', should not the same be the case with 'she' and 'woman'? Either English must have neutral words or the meaning of existing words must change. Though such type of change generally takes a while to implement, neohumanism insists that it be done.

=== Social progress ===
As with [[Progressive Utilization Theory|PROUT]], neohumanism views social progress as a condition in which the welfare and happiness of the entire society is increased. Neohumanism considers the individual and the society to be an inalienable concomitance. Unlike other philosophical theories that would [[Satisficing|satisfice]] or allegedly optimize social well-being through principles like the [[lesser of two evils principle]] or the [[greatest good for the greatest number]], neohumanism measures progress on the basis of improvements in the poorest sectors of society. According to neohumanism, what is genuinely good for the individual is also good for the society; and what is genuinely good for the society is also good for the individual.

Neohumanism distinguishes two ways in which [[social progress]] may be effected: evolution and revolution.

* '''Evolution''' brings gradual and specific change.
* '''Revolution''' brings rapid and comprehensive change.

Of the two systems, neohumanism greatly prefers revolution.&lt;ref&gt;''Now, those who are courageous enough to speak out this truth in clear language – those who say, "Shatter this bondage of limitation!" – their path is called the path of revolution. And those who say, "Everything will be done gradually... why so much haste?" – their path is called the path of evolution. They can never accomplish any glorious task.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neohumanism distinguishes four types of people who take a stance on the subject of social change: [[Reactionary|reactionaries]], [[Reformism|reformists]], vocal revolutionaries, and [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]].

* '''Reactionaries''' openly oppose change. Neohumanism respects their honesty but deems such persons to be suffering from a fear complex.&lt;ref&gt;''There are still others who say straightforwardly, "No, no, how can I contradict the way followed by my ancestors – my father, my grandfather?" They are reactionaries. They suffer from a mental disease. They are afraid to accept the new; they suffer from fear complex. They utter high-sounding phrases, but their hearts are filled with fear complexes. Not that they are terribly reprehensible. They say outwardly: "We are just doing the same as our ancestors did." But their ancestors used to wear wooden sandals instead of shoes, and shawls instead of tailored shirts, eat guŕ [raw sugar] instead of refined sugar, and drink water from wells instead of from taps. Do they follow this also?'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reformists''' promote some miscellaneous fixes. According to neohumanism, such persons outwardly claim to want change, but their inner desire is to perpetuate the machinery of exploitation. The contradictory nature of [[reformism]] may manifest as a ''pseudoreformist strategy''.&lt;ref&gt;''The reformists say, "Let us go slowly on the path of reform." But actually they intend that the process of exploitation should continue without interruption. There were many reformists in the world, but in reality they did not want the welfare of the society; they only wanted to perpetuate the process of exploitation by bringing about some patchwork improvements.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vocal revolutionaries''' (also referred to as ''pseudorevolutionaries'') are similar to reformists but even less forthright. They pretend to want revolutionary change, but their tall talk is belied by their action.&lt;ref&gt;''I have branded these people as "vocal revolutionaries". They deliver long lectures against exploitation, but they do the opposite in practice.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982).

* {{anchor|revolutionary}}'''Revolutionaries''' are forthright about their vision of a new society and unrelenting in their effort to materialize that vision.

According to neohumanism, revolutionaries are the true well-wishers of society. As such, neohumanism asserts that only the revolutionaries can effect significant social progress.

=== Universalism ===
Neohumanism's concept of [[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalism]] is non-religious. It is a type of love that extends to all beings of this universe, animate and even inanimate. From the perspective of Neohumanism, such a viewpoint is the ultimate outcome of the principle of 'social equality and 'protopsychospirituality'.&lt;ref name=dis10&gt;''Whenever people, after performing some activity, think of the Nucleus of the circum-rotarian universe, their minds become all-pervasive. Such people can never think of harming others; rather they will think only of universal welfare.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "An Ideology for a New Generation (Discourse 10)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Value systems ===
According to neohumanism, the human-centered [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach of general humanism is problematic in that it allows the possibility of cruelty to animals and plants. Such type of cruelty inevitably fosters inter-creature clash. Neohumanism extends this analysis by observing that cruelty has a tendency to become habitual. In other words, what a human does today to an animal, that same human may do tomorrow to another human being. Hence, according to neohumanism, general humanism may also foster intra-human clash. To offset the anthropic bias of general humanism and to reduce the potential for conflict, neohumanism posits two types of value: [[#Utility value|utility value]] and [[#Existential value|existential value]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Pseudohumanism (Discourse 8)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Existential value and utility value ====
According to neohumanism, until now, people have tended to think primarily in terms of [[#Utility value|utility value]], typically the [[utility]] that another entity has for oneself or one's nation. So, for example, when horses were a primary means of transportation, the utility value of horses to human beings was very great. Today, with more efficient and comfortable means of transportation, horses have lost most of their utility value for humans. Accordingly, Sarkar argues that the status of horses in modern society is much reduced. But neohumanism insists that horses also have ''existential value''. The existential value of a horse to itself is no less than the existential value of a human being to itself. In terms of the existential value one holds for one's own existence, all beings are said to be equal. Neohumanism would give greater importance to this existential value than to utility value.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Sarkar said: "Who says that those creatures who have lost their immediate utility value have no right to exist? No one has the moral right to say this.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Critiques ==
In a recent book,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R. ''Violence and New Religious Movements''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2011. {{ISBN|0199735611}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Crovetto asserts that there is a "dramatic" number of correlations between [[Ananda Marga]] and [[Mark Juergensmeyer|Mark Juergensmeyer's]] "description of [[#Religion|religious]] groups inclined toward [[terrorism]]". Crovetto mentions here the imagery of "cosmic war" that appears in Sarkar's writings, and Crovetto repeatedly references language that seems to "satanize" opponents, for example, the term ''[[#Exploiters|demon in human form]]'' that is part of the terminology of neohumanism. After considerable analysis, Crovetto concludes that it is probably more appropriate to describe the followers of Sarkar as [[#revolutionary|''revolutionary'']] rather than ''terrorist''. As such, Crovetto classifies them as "revolutionary sociospiritual [[Utopia|''utopians'']]".

'''Oil well control''' is the management of the dangerous effects caused by the unexpected release of [[formation fluid]], such as [[natural gas]] and/or [[crude oil]], upon surface equipment of oil or gas [[drilling rig]]s and escaping into the atmosphere. Technically, oil well control involves preventing the formation fluid, usually referred to as [[#Kicks|kick]], from entering into the [[wellbore]] during drilling.

Formation fluid can enter the wellbore if the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] being drilled.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, William C.; Plisga, Gary J. (2005). ''Standard Handbook of Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering'' (2nd edition). Elsevier.

Retrieved 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Oil well control also includes monitoring a well for signs of impending influx of formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling and procedures, to stop the well from flowing when it happens by taking proper remedial actions.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger article, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=well%20control "Well control"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to manage and control these pressure effects can cause serious equipment damage and injury, or loss of life.  Improperly managed well control situations can cause [[blowout (well drilling)|blowouts]], which are uncontrolled and explosive expulsions of formation fluid from the well, potentially resulting in a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Oil and Gas glossary, [http://oilgasglossary.com/primary-well-control.html "Primary Well control"], ''"Oil and Gas Field Technical Terms Glossary"''.

==Importance of oil well control==
[[Image:H104.jpg|thumb|Modern driller Argentina.]]
Oil well control is one of the most important aspects of drilling operations. Improper handling of [[#Kicks|kicks]] in oil well control can result in blowouts with very grave consequences, including the loss of valuable resources. Even though the cost of a blowout (as a result of improper/no oil well control) can easily reach several millions of US dollars, the monetary loss is not as serious as the other damages that can occur: irreparable damage to the environment, waste of valuable resources, ruined equipment, and most importantly, the safety and lives of personnel on the drilling rig.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Schubert, [http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2010/01/15WCFocus.pdf "Managed-Pressure Drilling: Kick Detection and Well Control" Section: "Kick Detection While Drilling"], Society of Petroleum Engineers, ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'' (JPT), archived 2010/01/15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schub"&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, [http://www.pe.tamu.edu/schubert/public_html/PETE%20625/MEng%20Report.pdf "Well control"], ''Texas A&amp;M University MEng Report for well control'' (December 1995). Retrieved 2011-01-04, p.'''I'''-1/2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to avert the consequences of blowout, the utmost attention must be given to oil well control. That is why oil well control procedures should be in place prior to the start of an abnormal situation noticed within the wellbore, and ideally when a new rig position is sited.  In other words, this includes the time the new location is picked, all drilling, [[Completion (oil well)|completion]], [[workover]], [[snubbing]] and any other drilling-related operations that should be executed with proper oil well control in mind.&lt;ref name=Schub/&gt; This type of preparation involves widespread training of personnel, the development of strict operational guidelines and the design of drilling programs — maximizing the probability of successfully regaining hydrostatic control of a well after a significant influx of formation fluid has taken place.&lt;ref name=Schub/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Bybee, [http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2010/01/15WCFocus.pdf "A Well-Specific Approach to the Quantification of Well Control"], Society of Petroleum Engineers, ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'' (JPT), archived 2010/01/15, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental concepts and terminology==
[[Pressure]] is a very important concept in the oil and gas industry. Pressure can be defined as: the force exerted per unit area. Its [[International System of Units|SI]] unit is [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] per square metre or [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]]. Another unit, [[Bar (unit)|bar]], is also widely used as a measure of pressure, with 1&amp;nbsp;bar equal to 100&amp;nbsp;kilopascals. Normally pressure is measured in the U.S. petroleum industry in units of [[Pounds per square inch|pounds force per square inch]] of area, or psi. 1000 &amp;nbsp;psi equals 6894.76&amp;nbsp;kilo-pascals.

===Hydrostatic pressure===
[[Fluid statics#Hydrostatic pressure|Hydrostatic pressure]] (HSP), as stated, is defined as pressure due to a column of fluid that is not moving. That is, a column of fluid that is static, or at rest, exerts pressure due to local force of gravity on the column of the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Oil and Gas glossary, [http://oilgasglossary.com/hydrostatic-pressure.html "Hydrostatic Pressure"], ''"Oil and Gas Field Technical Terms Glossary"''. Retrieved 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula for calculating hydrostatic pressure in SI units ([[newtons|N]]/[[square meter|m²]]) is:

: Hydrostatic pressure = Height (m) × Density (kg/m³) × Gravity (m/s²).&lt;ref&gt;Micheal Nelkon &amp; Philip Parker, ''Advanced Level Physics'', 7th Edition, New Delhi, India, CBS Publishers, 1995, pp. 103–105, {{ISBN|81-239-0400-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All fluids in a [[wellbore]] exert hydrostatic pressure, which is a function of [[density]] and vertical height of the fluid column. In US oil field units, hydrostatic pressure can be expressed as:

: ''HSP'' = 0.052 × ''MW'' × ''TVD''', where '''MW''' ([[Mud weight|'''M'''ud '''W'''eight or density]]) is the drilling-fluid density in pounds per gallon (ppg), '''TVD''' is the [[true vertical depth]] in feet and '''HSP''' is the hydrostatic pressure in psi.
The 0.052 is needed as the conversion factor to psi unit of HSP.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''1'''-1, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article,[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=hydrostatic%20pressure "Hydrostatic pressure"], "Schlumberger OilField Glossary". Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

To convert these units to SI units, one can use:

*1 ppg = ≈ {{val|119.8264273|u=kg/m³}}
*1&amp;nbsp;ft = 0.3048 metres
*1 psi = 0.0689475729 bar
*1 bar = 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pascals
*1bar= 15 psi

===Pressure gradient===
The [[pressure gradient]] is described as the pressure per unit length. Often in oil well control, pressure exerted by fluid is expressed in terms of its pressure gradient. The SI unit is pascals/metre. The hydrostatic pressure gradient can be written as:

: Pressure gradient (psi/ft) = HSP/TVD = 0.052 × MW (ppg).&lt;ref name="Jerome Jacob Schubert 1995"&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, p. '''1'''-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation pressure===
Formation pressure is the pressure exerted by the [[formation fluid]]s, which are the liquids and gases contained in the geologic formations encountered while drilling for oil or gas. It can also be said to be the pressure contained within the pores of the formation or reservoir being drilled. Formation pressure is a result of the hydrostatic pressure of the formation fluids, above the depth of interest, together with pressure trapped in the formation. Under formation pressure, there are 3 levels:
normally pressured formation,
abnormal formation pressure, or
subnormal formation pressure.

;Normally pressured formation
Normally pressured formation has a formation pressure that is the same with the hydrostatic pressure of the fluids above it. As the fluids above the formation are usually some form of water, this pressure can be defined as the pressure exerted by a column of water from the formation's depth to sea level.

The normal hydrostatic pressure gradient for freshwater is 0.433&amp;nbsp;pounds per square inch per foot (psi/ft), or 9.792 kilopascals per meter (kPa/m), and 0.465&amp;nbsp;psi/ft for water with dissolved solids like in Gulf Coast waters, or 10.516&amp;nbsp;kPa/m. The density of formation water in saline or marine environments, such as along the Gulf Coast, is about 9.0&amp;nbsp;[[Pressure#pounds per gallon|ppg]] or 1078.43&amp;nbsp;kg/m³. Since this is the highest for both Gulf Coast water and fresh water, a normally pressured formation can be controlled with a 9.0&amp;nbsp;ppg mud.

Sometimes the weight of the overburden, which refers to the rocks and fluids above the formation, will tend to compact the formation, resulting in pressure built-up within the formation if the fluids are trapped in place. The formation in this case will retain its normal pressure only if there is a communication with the surface. Otherwise, an ''abnormal formation pressure'' will result.

;Abnormal formation pressure
As discussed above, once the fluids are trapped within the formation and not allow to escape there is a pressure build-up leading to abnormally high formation pressures. This will generally require a mud weight of greater than 9.0&amp;nbsp;ppg to control. Excess pressure, called "overpressure" or "geopressure", can cause a well to blow out or become uncontrollable during drilling.

;Subnormal formation pressure
Subnormal formation pressure is a formation pressure that is less than the normal pressure for the given depth. It is common in formations that had undergone production of original hydrocarbon or formation fluid in them.&lt;ref name="Jerome Jacob Schubert 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=abnormal%20pressure "Abnormal Pressure"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=underpressure "UnderPressure"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=normal%20pressure "Normal Pressure"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overburden pressure===
''Overburden pressure'' is the pressure exerted by the weight of the rocks and contained fluids above the zone of interest. Overburden pressure varies in different regions and formations. It is the force that tends to compact a formation vertically. The density of these usual ranges of rocks is about 18 to 22&amp;nbsp;ppg (2,157 to 2,636&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). This range of densities will generate an overburden pressure gradient of about 1&amp;nbsp;psi/ft (22.7&amp;nbsp;kPa/m). Usually, the 1&amp;nbsp;psi/ft is not applicable for shallow marine sediments or massive salt. In offshore however, there is a lighter column of sea water, and the column of underwater rock does not go all the way to the surface. Therefore, a lower overburden pressure is usually generated at an offshore depth, than would be found at the same depth on land.

Mathematically, overburden pressure can be derived as:

: &lt;big&gt;S = ρ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;× D&lt;/big&gt;×g

where
:g = acceleration due to gravity

: &lt;big&gt;S&lt;/big&gt; = overburden pressure

: &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; = average formation bulk density

: &lt;big&gt;D&lt;/big&gt; = vertical thickness of the overlying sediments

The bulk density of the sediment is a function of rock matrix density, porosity within the confines of the pore spaces, and porefluid density. This can be expressed as

: &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = φρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; + (1 – φ)ρ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where

: &lt;big&gt;φ&lt;/big&gt; = rock porosity

: &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; = formation fluid density

: &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; = rock matrix density&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp. '''1'''-3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, Bill; Schubert, Jerome; Haghshenas, Arash; Paknejad, Amir Saman; Hughes, Jim (2008). ''Managed Pressure Drilling''. Gulf Publishing Company.

===Fracture pressure===
''Fracture pressure'' can be defined as pressure required to cause a formation to fail or split. As the name implies, it is the pressure that causes the formation to fracture and the circulating fluid to be lost. Fracture pressure is usually expressed as a gradient, with the common units being psi/ft (kPa/m) or ppg (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

To fracture a formation, three things are generally needed, which are:

# Pump into the formation. This will require a pressure in the wellbore greater than formation pressure.
# The pressure in the wellbore must also exceed the rock matrix strength.
# And finally the wellbore pressure must be greater than one of the three principal stresses in the formation.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, p. '''1'''-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, Bill; ''et al''. (2008). ''Managed Pressure Drilling'', p.23, section 1.8.1 (online version).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pump pressure (system pressure losses)===
''Pump pressure'', which is also referred to as ''system pressure loss'', is the sum total of all the pressure losses from the oil well surface equipment, the [[drill pipe]], the [[drill collar]], the [[drill bit]], and [[Annulus (oil well)|annular]] friction losses around the drill collar and drill pipe. It measures the system pressure loss at the start of the circulating system and measures the total friction pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''1'''-4, 5, 6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slow pump pressure (SPP)===
''Slow pump pressure'' is the circulating pressure (pressure used to pump fluid through the whole active fluid system, including the borehole and all the surface tanks that constitute the primary system during drilling) at a reduced rate. SPP is very important during a well kill operation in which circulation (a process in which drilling fluid is circulated out of the suction pit, down the drill pipe and drill collars, out the bit, up the annulus, and back to the pits while drilling proceeds) is done at a reduced rate to allow better control of circulating pressures and to enable the mud properties (density and viscosity) to be kept at desired values. The slow pump pressure can also be referred to as "kill rate pressure" or "slow circulating pressure" or "kill speed pressure" and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Oil and Gas glossary, [http://oilgasglossary.com/circulate.html "Circulate"], ''"Oil and Gas Field Technical Terms Glossary"''. Retrieved 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article,[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=circulate "Circulate"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shut-in drill pipe pressure===
''Shut-in drill pipe pressure'' (SIDPP), which is recorded when a well is shut in on a kick, is a measure of the difference between the pressure at the bottom of the hole and the hydrostatic pressure (HSP) in the drillpipe. During a well shut-in, the pressure of the wellbore stabilizes, and the formation pressure equals the pressure at the bottom of the hole. The drillpipe at this time should be full of known-density fluid. Therefore, the formation pressure can be easily calculated using the SIDPP. This means that the SIDPP gives a direct of formation pressure during a kick.

===Shut-in casing pressure (SICP)===
The ''shut-in casing pressure'' (SICP) is a measure of the difference between the formation pressure and the HSP in the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] when a kick occurs.

The pressures encountered in the annulus can be estimated using the following mathematical equation:

: FP = HSP&lt;sub&gt;mud&lt;/sub&gt; + HSP&lt;sub&gt;influx&lt;/sub&gt; + SICP

where

: FP = formation pressure (psi)

: HSP&lt;sub&gt;mud&lt;/sub&gt; = Hydrostatic pressure of the mud in the annulus (psi)

: HSP&lt;sub&gt;influx&lt;/sub&gt; = Hydrostatic pressure of the influx (psi)

: SICP = shut-in casing pressure (psi)

===Bottom-hole pressure (BHP)===
''Bottom-hole pressure'' (BHP) is the pressure at the bottom of a well. The pressure is usually measured at the bottom of the hole. This pressure may be calculated in a static, fluid-filled wellbore with the equation:

: BHP = D × ρ × C,

where

: BHP = bottom-hole pressure
: D =  the vertical depth of the well
: ρ = density
: C = units conversion factor
: (or, in the English system, BHP = D × MWD × 0.052).
In Canada the formula is depth in meters x density in kgs x the constant gravity factor (0.00981), which will give the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the well bore or (hp) hp=bhp with pumps off.
The bottom-hole pressure is dependent on the following:
*Hydrostatic pressure (HSP)
*Shut-in surface pressure (SIP)
*Friction pressure
*Surge pressure (occurs when transient pressure increases the bottom-hole pressure)
*Swab pressure (occurs when transient pressure reduces the bottom-hole pressure)
Therefore, BHP can be said to be the sum of all pressures at the bottom of the wellhole, which equals:

: BHP = HSP + SIP + friction + Surge - swab&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''1'''-8, 9, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, Bill; ''et al.'' (2008). ''Managed Pressure Drilling'', p.11, section 1.4.1 (online version).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic calculations in oil well control==
There are some basic calculations that need to be carried during oil well control. A few of these essential calculations will be discussed below. Most of the units here are in US oil field units, but these units can be converted to their SI units equivalent by using this [[Conversion of units]] link.

===Capacity===
The capacity of [[drill string]] is an essential issue in oil well control. The capacity of drillpipe, drill collars or hole is the volume of fluid that can be contained within them.

The capacity formula is as shown below:

: ''Capacity'' = ID&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1029.4

where

: Capacity =  Volume in barrels per foot(bbl/ft)
: ID = Inside diameter in inches
: 1029.4  = Units conversion factor

Also the total pipe or hole volume is given by :

: ''Volume in barrels'' (bbls) = ''Capacity'' (bbl/ft) × length (ft)

Feet of pipe occupied by a given volume is given by:

: ''Feet of pipe'' (ft) = ''Volume of mud'' (bbls) / ''Capacity'' (bbls/ft)

Capacity calculation is important in oil well control due to the following:
*Volume of the drillpipe and the drill collars must be pumped to get kill weight mud to the bit during kill operation.
*It is used to spot pills and plugs at various depths in the wellbore.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, p.2-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annular capacity===
This is the volume contained between the inside diameter of the hole and the outside diameter of the pipe.
Annular capacity is given by :

: ''Annular capacity'' (bbl/ft) = (ID&lt;sub&gt;hole&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - OD&lt;sub&gt;pipe&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / 1029.4

where

: ID&lt;sub&gt;hole&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = Inside diameter of the casing or open hole in inches

: OD&lt;sub&gt;pipe&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = Outside diameter of the pipe in inches

Similarly

: ''Annular volume'' (bbls) = ''Annular capacity'' (bbl/ft) × length (ft)

and
    
: ''Feet occupied by volume of mud in annulus''  = ''Volume of mud'' (bbls) / ''Annular Capacity'' (bbls/ft).&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''2'''-1, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluid level drop===
''Fluid level drop'' is the distance the mud level will drop when a dry string(a bit that is not plugged) is being pulled from the wellbore and it is given by:

: ''Fluid level drop'' = Bbl disp / (CSG cap + Pipe disp)

or

: ''Fluid level drop'' = Bbl disp / (Ann cap + Pipe cap)

and the resulting loss of HSP is given by:

: ''Lost HSP'' = 0.052 × MW × ''Fluid drop''

where

: ''Fluid drop'' = distance the fluid falls (ft)

: ''Bbl disp'' = displacement of the pulled pipe (bbl)

: ''CSG cap''  = casing capacity (bbl/ft)

: ''Pipe disp'' = pipe displacement (bbl/ft)

: ''Ann cap'' = Annular capacity between casing and pipe (bbl/ft)

: ''Pipe cap'' = pipe capacity

: ''Lost HSP'' = Lost hydrostatic pressure (psi)

: ''MW'' =  mud weight (ppg)

When pulling a wet string (the bit is plugged) and the fluid from the drillpipe is not returned to the hole. The fluid drop is then changed to the following:

: ''Fluid level drop'' = ''Bbl disp'' / ''Ann cap''

===Kill Mud weight (KMW)===
''Kill Mud weight''  is the density of the mud required to balance formation pressure during kill operation. The Kill Weight Mud can be calculated by:

: ''KWM =  SIDPP/(0.052 × TVD) + OWM''

where

: ''KWM'' = kill weight mud (ppg)

: ''SIDPP'' = shut-in drillpipe pressure (psi)

: ''TVD'' &amp;nbsp; = true vertical depth (ft)

: ''OWM'' &amp;nbsp; = original weight mud (ppg)

But when the formation pressure can be determined from data sources such as bottom hole pressure, then ''KWM'' can be calculated as follows:

: ''KWM'' = ''FP'' / 0.052 × ''TVD''

where ''FP'' = Formation pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''2'''-4, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kicks==
[[File:IXTOC I oil well blowout.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|[[Ixtoc I]] oil well blowout]]
'''Kick''' is the entry of [[formation fluid]] into the wellbore during drilling operations. It occurs because the pressure exerted by the column of [[drilling fluid]] is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation drilled. The whole essence of oil well control is to prevent kick from occurring and if it happens to prevent it from developing into [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]]. An uncontrolled kick usually results from not deploying the proper equipment, using poor practices, or a lack of training of the rig crews. Loss of oil well control may lead into blowout, which represents one of the most severe threats associated with the exploration of petroleum resources involving the risk of lives and environmental and economic consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article,[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=kick "Kick"],''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM article, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/50495081/Basic-Well-Control "Basic Well Control"], Scribd site. Accessed 10/04/2011, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of kicks===
{{main|Causes of kicks}}
A kick will occur when the bottom hole pressure(BHP) of a well falls below the formation pressure and the formation fluid flows into the wellbore.There are usually causes for kicks some of which are:
*[[#Failure to keep the hole full during a trip|Failure to keep the hole full during a trip]]
*[[#Swabbing while tripping|Swabbing while tripping]]
*[[#Lost circulation|Lost circulation]]
*[[#Insufficient density of fluid|Insufficient density of fluid]]
*[[#Abnormal pressure|Abnormal pressure]]
*[[#Drilling into an adjacent well|Drilling into an adjacent well]]
*[[#Lost control during drill stem test|Lost control during drill stem test]]
*[[#Improper fill on trips|Improper fill on trips]]

====Failure to keep the hole full during a trip====
''Tripping'' is the complete operation of removing the [[Drill string|drillstring]] from the wellbore and running it back in the hole. This operation is typically undertaken when the bit (which is the tool used to crush or cut rock during drilling) becomes dull or broken, and no longer drills the rock efficiently. A typical drilling operation of deep oil or gas wells may require up to 8 or more trips of the drill string to replace a dull rotary bit for one well.

Tripping out of the hole means that the entire volume of steel (of drillstring) is being removed, or has been removed, from the well. This displacement of the drill string (the steel) will leave out a volume of space that must be replaced with an equal volume of [[Drilling mud|mud]]. If the replacement is not done, the fluid level in the wellbore will drop, resulting in a loss of hydrostatic pressure (HSP) and bottom hole pressure (BHP). If this bottom hole pressure reduction goes below the [[#Formation pressure|formation pressure]], a [[#Kicks|kick]] will definitely occur.

====Swabbing while tripping====
''Swabbing'' occurs when bottom hole pressure is reduced due to the effects of pulling the [[drill string]] upward in the bored hole. During the tripping out of the hole, the space formed by the [[Drill pipe|drillpipe]], [[drill collar]], or tubing (which are being removed) must be replaced by something, usually [[Drilling mud|mud]]. If the rate of tripping out is greater than the rate the mud is being pumped into the void space (created by the removal of the drill string), then swab will occur. If the reduction in bottom hole pressure caused by swabbing is below [[#Formation pressure|formation pressure]], then a [[#Kicks|kick]] will occur.

====Lost circulation====
''Lost circulation'' usually occurs when the hydrostatic pressure fractures an open formation. When this occurs, there is loss in circulation, and the height of the fluid column decreases, leading to lower [[#Hydrostatic pressure|HSP]] in the [[Well bore|wellbore]]. A kick can occur if steps are not taken to keep the hole full. Lost circulation can be caused by:
*excessive mud weights
*excessive annular friction loss
*excessive surge pressure during trips, or "spudding" the bit
*excessive shut-in pressures.

====Insufficient density of fluid====
If the density of the drilling fluid or [[Drilling mud|mud]]  in the well bore is not sufficient to keep the formation pressure in check, then a kick can occur. Insufficient density of the drilling fluid can be as a result of the following :
* attempting to drill by using an underbalanced weight solution
*excessive dilution of the mud
*heavy rains in the pits
*barite settling in the pits
*spotting low density pills in the well.

====Abnormal pressure====
Another cause of kicks is drilling accidentally into [[#Abnormal Formation pressure|abnormally-pressured]] permeable zones. The increased formation pressure may be greater than the bottom hole pressure, resulting in a kick.

====Drilling into an adjacent well====
Drilling into an adjacent well is a potential problem, particularly in [[offshore drilling]] where a
large number of directional wells are drilled from the same [[Oil platform|platform]]. If the drilling well penetrates the [[production string]] of a previously completed well, the formation fluid from the completed well will enter the wellbore of the drilling well, causing a kick. If this occurs at a shallow depth, it is an extremely dangerous situation and could easily result in an uncontrolled blowout with little to no warning of the event.

====Lost control during drill stem test====
A drill-stem test is performed by setting a packer above the formation to be tested, and allowing the formation to flow. During the course of the test, the bore hole or casing below the packer, and at least a portion of the drill pipe or tubing, is filled with formation fluid. At the conclusion of the test, this fluid must be removed by proper well control techniques to return the well to a safe condition. Failure to follow the correct procedures to kill the well could lead to a blowout.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''3'''-1, 2, 3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM article, "Basic Well Control", pp.19/20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, William C.; Plisga, Gary J. (2005). ''Standard Handbook of Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering'', pp.39-41, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Improper fill on trips====
Improper fill on trip occurs when the volume of drilling fluid to keep the hole full on a Trip (complete operation of removing the [[Drill string|drillstring]] from the wellbore and running it back in the hole) is less than that calculated or less than Trip Book Record. This condition is usually caused by formation fluid entering the wellbore due to the swabbing action of the drill string, and, if action is not taken soon, the well will enter a kick state.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''4'''-1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grace, Robert D.

===Kick warning signs===
[[Image:Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling unit on fire 2010.jpg|right|thumb|[[Deepwater Horizon explosion|Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blowout]], 21 April 2010]]
In oil well control, a kick should be able to be detected promptly, and if a kick is detected, proper kick prevention operations must be taken immediately to avoid a blowout. There are various tell-tale signs that signal an alert crew that a kick is about to start. Knowing these signs will keep a kicking oil well under control, and avoid a blowout:

====Sudden increase in drilling rate====
A sudden increase in penetration rate (drilling break) is usually caused by a change in the type of formation being drilled. However, it may also signal an increase in formation pore pressure, which may indicate a possible kick.

====Increase in annulus flow rate====
If the rate at which the pumps are running is held constant, then the flow from the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] should be constant. If the annulus flow increases without a corresponding change in pumping rate, the additional flow is caused by formation fluid(s) feeding into the [[well bore]] or gas expansion. This will indicate an impending kick.

====Gain in pit volume====
If there is an unexplained increase in the volume of surface mud in the pit (a large tank that holds drilling fluid on the rig), it could signify an impending kick. This is because as the formation fluid feeds into the wellbore, it causes more [[drilling fluid]] to flow from the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] than is pumped down the [[drill string]], thus the volume of fluid in the pit(s) increases.

====Change in pump speed/pressure====
A decrease in pump pressure or increase in pump speed can happen as a result of a decrease in [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the annulus as the formation fluids enters the wellbore. As the lighter formation fluid flows into the wellbore, the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the annular column of fluid decreases, and the drilling fluid in the drill pipe tends to U-tube into the annulus. When this occurs, the pump pressure will drop, and the pump speed will increase. The lower pump pressure and increase in pump speed symptoms can also be indicative of a hole in the drill string, commonly referred to as a washout. Until a confirmation can be made whether a washout or a well kick has occurred, a kick should be assumed.

==Categories of oil well control==
There are basically three types of oil well control which are:
primary oil well control,
secondary oil well control, and 
tertiary oil well control. Those types are explained below.

===Primary Oil Well Control===
Primary oil well control is the process which maintains a hydrostatic pressure in the
wellbore greater than the pressure of the fluids in the formation being drilled, but less than formation fracture pressure. It uses the [[Drilling mud|mud]] weight to provide sufficient pressure to prevent an influx of formation fluid into the wellbore. If hydrostatic pressure is less than formation pressure, then formation fluids will enter the wellbore. If the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid in the wellbore exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation, then the fluid in the well could be lost. In an extreme case of lost circulation, the formation pressure may exceed hydrostatic pressure, allowing formation fluids to enter into the well.

===Secondary Oil Well Control===
Secondary oil well control is done after the Primary oil well control has failed to prevent formation fluids from entering the wellbore. This process uses [[Blowout Preventer|“blow out preventer”]], a BOP, to prevent the escape of wellbore fluids from the well. As the rams and choke of the BOP remain closed, a pressure built up test is carried out and a kill mud weight calculated and pumped inside the well to kill the kick and circulate it out.

===Tertiary (or shearing) Oil Well Control===
Tertiary oil well control describes the third line of defense, where the formation cannot be controlled by primary or secondary well control (hydrostatic and equipment). This happens in underground blowout situations. The following are examples of tertiary well control:

*Drill a [[relief well]] to hit an adjacent well that is flowing and kill the well with heavy mud
*Rapid pumping of heavy mud to control the well with equivalent circulating density
*Pump barite or heavy weighting agents to plug the wellbore in order to stop flowing
*Pump cement to plug the wellbore&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM article, "Basic Well Control", p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jetj"&gt;Rachain Jetjongjit, [http://www.drillingformulas.com/what-is-tertiary-well-control/ "What is Tertiary well control"], DrillingFormulas.com, Drilling Formulas and Drilling Calculations.

Accessed 2011-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shut-in procedures==
Using shut-in procedures is one of the oil-well-control measures to curtail kicks and prevent a [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] from occurring. Shut-in procedures are specific procedures for closing a well in case of a kick. When any positive indication of a kick is observed, such as a sudden increase in flow, or an increase in pit level, then the well should be shut-in immediately. If a well shut-in is not done promptly, a blowout is likely to happen.

Shut-in procedures are usually developed and practiced for every rig activity, such as drilling, tripping, logging, running tubular, performing a drill stem test, and so on. The primary purpose of a specific shut-in procedure is to minimize kick volume entering into a wellbore when a kick occurs, regardless of what phase of rig activity is occurring. However, a shut-in procedure is a company-specific procedure, and the policy of a company will dictate how a well should be shut-in.

They are generally two type of Shut-in procedures which are soft shut-in or hard shut-in. Of these two methods, the hard shut-in is the fastest method to shut in the well; therefore, it will minimize the volume of kick allowed into the wellbore.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, p.'''5'''-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Well kill procedures==
Source: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oil well drilling engineering|last=Rabia|first=Hussain|publisher=Springer|year=1986|isbn=0860106616|location=|pages=302–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A well kill procedure is an oil well control method. Once the well has been [[#Shut-in procedures|shut-in]] on a [[#Kicks|kick]], proper kill procedures must be done immediately. The general idea in well kill procedure is to circulate out any formation fluid already in the [[wellbore]] during kick, and then circulate a satisfactory weight of kill mud called Kill Weight Mud (KWM) into the well without allowing further fluid into the hole. If this can be done, then once the kill mud has been fully circulated around the well, it is possible to open up the well and restart normal operations. Generally, a kill weight mud (KWM) mix, which provides just hydrostatic balance for formation pressure, is circulated. This allows approximately constant bottom hole pressure, which is slightly greater than formation pressure to be maintained, as the kill circulation proceeds because of the additional small circulating friction pressure loss. After circulation, the well is opened up again.

The major well kill procedures used in oil well control are listed below:
*Wait and Weight
*Driller method
*Circulate and Weight
*Concurrent Method
*Reverse Circulation
*Dynamic Kill procedure
*Bullheading
*Volumetric Method
*Lubricate and Bleed&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''6'''-1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM article, "Basic Well Control". pp.37/38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil well control incidents - root causes==
[[Image:Oil well burning in Bibi Eibat.JPG|thumb|1904 [[oil well fire]] at [[Bibiheybət|Bibi-Eibat]] (near [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]).]]
There will always be potential oil well control problems, as long as there are drilling operations anywhere in the world. Most of these well control problems are as a result of some errors and can be eliminated, even though some are actually unavoidable. Since we know the consequences of failed well control are severe, efforts should be made to prevent some human errors which are the root causes of these incidents. These causes include:

*Lack of knowledge and skills of [[Drilling rig|rig]] personnel
*Improper work practices
*Lack of understanding of oil well control training
*Lack of application of policies, procedures, and standards
*Inadequate risk management&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM training material, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/50495081/Basic-Well-Control "Basic Well Control"], Scribd site. Accessed 10/04/2011, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations for building well-control culture==
An effective oil-well-control culture can be established within a company by requiring well control training of all rig workers, by assessing well control competence at the rigsite, and by supporting qualified personnel in carrying out safe well control practices during the drilling process. Such a culture also requires personnel involved in oil well control to commit to following the right procedures at the right time. Clearly communicated policies and procedures, credible training, competence assurance, and management support can minimize and mitigate well control incidents. An effective well control culture is built upon technically competent personnel who are also trained and skilled in crew resource management (a discipline within human factors), which comprises situation awareness, decision-making (problem-solving), communication, teamwork, and leadership. Training programs are developed and accredited by organizations such as the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) and International Well Control Forum (IWCF).

[http://www.iadc.org IADC], headquartered in Houston, TX, is a nonprofit industry association that accredits well control training through a program called WellSharp, which is aimed at providing the necessary knowledge and practical skills critical to successful well control. This training comprises drilling and well servicing activities, as well as course levels applicable to everyone involved in supporting or conducting drilling operations--from the office support staff to the floorhands and drillers and up to the most-experienced supervisory personnel. Training such as those included in the WellSharp program and the courses offered by IWCF contribute to the competence of personnel, but true competence can be assessed only at the jobsite during operations. Therefore, IADC also accredits industry competence assurance programs to help ensure quality and consistency of the competence assurance process for drilling operations. IADC has regional offices all over the world and accredits companies worldwide. [http://www.iwcf.org/ IWCF] is an [[non-governmental organization|NGO]], headquartered in Europe, whose main aim is to develop and administer well-control certification programs for personnel employed in oil-well drilling and for workover and well-intervention operations.&lt;ref&gt;Kareen Bybee, [http://www.spe.org/spe-site/spe/spe/jpt/2009/01/16WCFocus.pdf "Building a Well-Control Culture"], Society of Petroleum Engineers, ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'' (JPT), archived 2009/01/16, p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IADC, [http://www.iadc.org/wellsharp/ "WellSharp"], IADC.org, International Association of Drilling Contractors Well-Control Accreditation Program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4081">'''Online patient education''', also known as '''online patient engagement''', is a method of providing medical information and education to patients using [[learning management systems]] delivered through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of bariatric Centers of Excellence Web sites for functionality and efficacy. Surg Obes Relat Dis. 2008 Sep-Oct;4(5):571-4&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of computer-based instruction and includes web seminars, downloadable materials, interactive learning courses, and audio/visual presentations. Generally, online patient education is supplemented with in-person consultations tailored to each individual.

==General usage==
Health professionals use online patient education to prepare patients for medical procedures, administer intake and informed consent paperwork, educate patients about health conditions, provide information about preventive care, encourage healthy behavior and lifestyle changes, etc. Health insurance companies use online patient education to inform patients about coverage policies. 

Online patient education is gaining popularity as home Internet access becomes more common and medical practices increasingly utilize digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Issues in patient education Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health, Volume 49, Issue 3, Pages 203-209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Computers in Patient Education. Comput Inform Nurs 21(2):88-96, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Patients either view online patient education programs and materials in a medical office or from their homes or other remote locations with Internet access. Content may include interactive features such as quizzes, live question and answer sessions (in moderated web seminars), and the ability to complete and submit forms.

==Patient education by type==

===On location===
Any education delivered verbally by a healthcare provider to a single patient or group of patients can be considered as On Location patient education. Although this is still the most commonly used patient education method it is time consuming, can have consistency problems, and relies heavily on the individual patient ability to absorb, understand, and retain the verbal information.

===Paper based===
The second most common method. Any information brochure at a healthcare provider office falls under this category. The benefits of printed materials is that patients can refer back to the information

===Web based===
Patient education that is made available by a healthcare provider via his/her website, specific portal, or EHR. Web based education can be provided in an [[Asynchronous learning|Asynchronous]] and [[Synchronous learning|Synchronous]] styles.

==Advantages==
Educating patients with online technology can be advantageous&lt;ref&gt;Online patient education: A superior alternative to in-person information seminars Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases, Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages S44-S45&lt;/ref&gt; for both medical practices and patients because it gives health care providers the opportunity to create comprehensive educational materials that are consistently presented, rather than relying on face-to-face meetings in which information is presented by a staff member.&lt;ref&gt;Patients Postoperatively Forget Aspects of Preoperative Patient Education. Obesity Surgery, 15, 2005 1066-1069&lt;/ref&gt; Patients need not possess advanced computer/web skills to use this method of learning. A survey of 3200 patients revealed that even patients who are not computer literate are satisfied with online patient education as means of learning about medical care.

'''Pervasive informatics''' is the study of how information affects interactions with the built environments they occupy. The term and concept were initially introduced by Professor [[Kecheng Liu]] during a keynote speech at the SOLI 2008 international conference.&lt;ref name="Keynote"&gt;[[Kecheng Liu|Liu, K.]] [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4686343&amp;tag=1"], ''Pervasive informatics in intelligent spaces for living and working'', Keynote, IEEE international Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics 2009, xviii –xix”&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation given|reason=This does not show the term was first established there|date=October 2015}}

The built environment is rich with information which can be utilised by its occupants to enhance the quality of their work and life. By introducing ICT systems, this information can be created, managed, distributed and consumed more effectively, leading to more advanced interactions between users and the environment. The social interactions in these spaces are of additional value, and Informatics can effectively capture the complexities of such information rich activities.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; Information literally pervades, or spreads throughout, these socio-technical systems, and pervasive informatics aims to study, and assist in the design of, pervasive information environments, or pervasive spaces, for the benefit of their stakeholders and users.

== Pervasive computing ==
Pervasive informatics may be initially viewed as simply another branch of [[Pervasive Computing|pervasive]], or [[ubiquitous computing]]. However, pervasive informatics places a greater emphasis on the ICT-enhanced socio-technical pervasive spaces, as opposed to the technology driven direction of pervasive computing. This distinction between fields is analogous to that of  [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] and  [[computing]], where Informatics focuses on the study of information, while the primary concern of computing is the processing of information. Pervasive informatics aims to analyse the pervasive nature of information, examining its various representations and transformations in pervasive spaces, which are enabled by pervasive computing technologies e.g. [[smart device]]s and intelligent control systems.

== Pervasive spaces ==
A pervasive space is characterised by the physical and informational interaction between the occupants and the built environment e.g. the act of controlling the building is a physical interaction, while the space responding to this action/user instruction is an informational interaction. 

Intelligent pervasive spaces are those that display intelligent behaviour in the form of adaptation to user requirements or the environment itself. Such intelligent behaviour can be implemented using artificial intelligence algorithms and agent-based technologies. These intelligent spaces aim to provide communication and computing services to their occupants in such a way that the experience is almost transparent e.g. automated control of heating and ventilation based on occupant preference profiles.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;

The term first appeared in an IBM Research Report &lt;ref&gt;Mcfaddin, S., D. Coffman et al.[http://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/papers/A164F52F0FE2A3DD85257379005811FE/$File/rc24381.pdf"], ''Celadon: Delivering Business Services to Mobile Users in Public Spaces'', IBM Research Report, RC24381.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not properly defined or discussed until later. An intelligent pervasive space is a “social and physical space with enhanced capability through ICT for human to interact with the built environments” &lt;ref name="Keynote" /&gt; An alternative definition is “an adaptable and dynamic area that optimises user services and management processes using information systems and networked ubiquitous technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, S. and Nakata, K. [http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/12316/"], ''Ubiquitous Monitoring and Behavioural Change: A Semiotic Perspective''. 11th International Conference on Informatics and Semiotics in Organisations (ICISO). Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China: 449-456”&lt;/ref&gt; A common point between these definitions is that pervasive computing technologies are the means by which intelligence and interactions are achieved in pervasive spaces, with the purpose of enhancing a users experience.

== Theories and techniques ==
Historically, there have been few attempts to consolidate approaches to studying the complex interplay between occupants and the built environment, and to assist in the design of pervasive information environments.  Many theoretical interdisciplinary approaches are relevant to the design of effective pervasive spaces. A core concept in pervasive informatics is the range of interactions that may occur in pervasive spaces: people to people, people to the physical and the physical space to technological artefacts such as sensors. In order to study these interactions it is necessary to have an understanding of what information is being created and exchanged.  In light of this, a series of theories which enable us to consider both social and technological interactions together form the foundations of pervasive informatics &lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;[[Kecheng Liu |Liu, K.]], Nakata, K. and Harty, C. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/earthscan/inbi/2010/00000002/00000001/art00002"], ''Pervasive informatics: theory, practice and future directions.'' Intelligent Buildings International, Volume 2, Number 1, 2010 , pp. 5-19(15)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== STS ===
[[Socio-technical systems]] provide an approach which assists in understanding and supporting the use of pervasive technologies. The space could be considered as a network of artefacts, information, technology and occupants. By adopting STS approaches, a means for dynamically investigating and mapping such networks becomes possible.

=== Distributed cognition ===
[[Distributed cognition]] can be used to explain how information is passed and processed, with a focus on both interactions between people, in addition to their interactions with the environment.&lt;ref name="hollan"&gt;Hollan, J., HUtchins, E. and Krish, D. [http://cleo.ics.uci.edu/teaching/Winter10/231/readings/2A-HollanHutchinsKirsh-DCOG-TOCHI.pdf"], Distributed Cognition: Toward a New
Foundation for Human-Computer
Interaction Research. ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000, Pages 174–196.&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions are analysed in terms of the trajectories of information.

=== CSCW ===
Human interactions with a space, and its effect on coordination mechanisms have been examined in the field of [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW). The concepts of [[media space]]s&lt;ref name="gaver"&gt;Gaver, W., [http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/07gaver.videoAffs.cscw92.pdf"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325031918/http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/07gaver.videoAffs.cscw92.pdf |date=2012-03-25 }}, ''The Affordances of Media Spaces for Collaboration''. In Proceedings of CSCW'92 (Toronto)&lt;/ref&gt; and awareness have also emerged from CSCW which are of relevance to pervasive informatics.

=== Semiotics ===
[[Semiotics]], the study of signs, can be used to assess the effectiveness of a built environment from six different levels: physical, empirical, syntactical, semantic, pragmatic and social. Semiotics enables us to understand the nature and characteristics of sign-based interactions in pervasive spaces.

== Trend and future research ==
The current technology-centred view of pervasive computing is no longer sufficient for studying the information in the built environment. Socio-technical approaches are required to direct attention to the interaction between the built environment and its occupants. 
The concept of pervasive informatics then captures this shift, and enables current research efforts in different fields to converge their focus and consolidate their methods under one label, leading to a better direction and understanding of this complex domain. Research issues identified for further study in pervasive informatics: 

*Understanding the impacts of intelligent pervasive spaces and enabling technologies on occupants &lt;ref&gt;Moran, S. and Nakata, K. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/earthscan/inbi/2010/00000002/00000001/art00005"], ''Analysing the factors affecting users in intelligent pervasive spaces'', Intelligent Buildings International, Volume 2, Number 1, 2010 , pp. 57-71”&lt;/ref&gt;
*Designing organisations as pervasive information systems—the role of information and artefacts in communication and interaction.
*Context-dependent information and knowledge management, towards effective decision support in pervasive spaces.
*Service-oriented design of intelligent buildings as adaptive and learning information spaces with regards to norms and emerging practices in intelligent pervasive spaces.
*Through-life intelligent support in building management, with a better understanding of the lifecycle of pervasive spaces from the conception, design, implementation, utilisation till recycling to achieve the building performance and sustainability.

The list, of course, is not exhaustive, but they all address the issues that lie on the boundaries between the physical, informational and social-capturing the essence of pervasive spaces.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;

'''Political law''' (or '''political activity law'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capdale.com/political_activity_law/ |title=Caplin &amp; Drysdale's political activity law page |publisher=Capdale.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an established legal practice area encompassing the intersection of [[politics]] and [[law]].  Political law comprises [[election law]], [[suffrage|voting rights]] law, [[campaign finance]] law, laws governing [[lobbying]] and lobbyists, [[open government]] laws, legislative and executive branch [[ethical code|ethics codes]], [[parliamentary procedure|legislative procedure]], [[administrative law|administrative procedure]], [[constitutional law]], and legislative and regulatory drafting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161021001140/http://politicallawgroup.com/OurServices Political Law Group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://econcordia.com/sites/IPPL/parliament.aspx?section=21 |title=Institute of Parliamentary and Political Law |publisher=Econcordia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312155927/http://econcordia.com/sites/IPPL/parliament.aspx?section=21 |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political laws are applied primarily to government officials, candidates, [[advocacy group]]s, [[lobbying|lobbyists]], [[business]]es, [[nonprofit organization]]s, and [[trade union]]s.

At the federal level, the [[Federal Election Commission]] enforces campaign finance law with respect to races for the [[United States House of Representatives]], [[United States Senate]], and the office of [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Election Commission|FEC]]&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigns for federal office are subject to contribution limits and certain contributions are prohibited.  The [http://www.justice.gov/criminal/pin/ Department of Justice's Public Integrity Section (PIN)] has jurisdiction involving alleged criminal violations of many political laws.

At the state level, most states have administrative agencies to enforce state law with respect to campaign finance and ethics rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=15331/ |title=National Conference of State Legislatures list of state ethics commissions |publisher=Ncsl.org |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attorney general of the state may also play a role in enforcement. Some local governments also maintain ethics agencies. At the state and local level these agencies might simply provide for disclosure of campaign finance registration and reporting forms (or lobbyist registration and reporting), or they may provide an enforcement scheme.

"Pay-to-play" restrictions are an example of political law.  For instance, in the context of municipal securities dealers, rules promulgated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board effectively prohibit certain individuals from contributing to the political funds of officials of issuers.&lt;ref&gt;Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rule G-37.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1254">'''Power Alley''' is a term used in [[audio engineering]] to denote the line between [[subwoofer]]s where output from each subwoofer is [[Phase (waves)|in phase]] and is noticeably louder.

==Problem==
Subwoofers placed at each side of the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] will typically cancel unpredictably everywhere in the listening area except along the center line between the [[Loudspeaker|speakers]].  Because of this, placing subwoofer [[Loudspeaker enclosure|cabinets]] together tends to give a smoother response to each member of the audience. 
This is explained in detail in "The Power Alley ".&lt;ref&gt;Brusi, Joe: ''The "Power Alley" - Discussion &amp; Solutions To The Troubling Interaction Of Subwoofer Stacks'', http://www.prosoundweb.com/article/in_search_of_the_power_alley&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solution==
Centering the subwoofers between the high end cabinets tends to minimize the timing 
error throughout the listening area.&lt;ref&gt;Pādrick, Tim: ''Subwoofer Info'', http://www.padrick.net/LiveSound/SubwooferInfo.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of separated subwoofers are more predictable outdoors, but subwoofers are often placed together as a starting point for indoor venues, too.

'''Process network synthesis''' (PNS) is a method to represent a process structure in a 'directed bipartite graph'. Process network synthesis uses the P-graph method to create a process structure. The scientific aim of this method is to find optimum structures.

Process network synthesis uses a bipartite graph method [[P-graph]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://p-graph.com/ P-graph method]&lt;/ref&gt; and employs combinatorial rules to find all feasible network solutions (maximum structure) and links raw materials to desired products related to the given problem. With a [[branch and bound]] optimisation routine and by defining the target value an optimum structure can be generated that optimises a chosen target function. 

Process Network Synthesis was originally developed to solve chemical process engineering processes. Target value as well as the structure can be changed depending on the field of application. Thus many more fields of application followed.

==Applications==
At [[Pannon University]] software the tools PNS Editor and PNS Studio were programmed to generate maximum structure of processes. This software includes the p-graph method and MSG, SSG and ABB [[branch and bound]] algorithms to detect optimum structures within the maximum available process flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedler|first1=F.|last2=Varga|first2=J.B.|last3=Feher|first3=E.|last4=Fan|first4=L.T.|title=Combinatorially Accelerated Branch-and-Bound Method for Solving the MIP Model of Process Network Synthesis|journal=Computational Methods and Applications|date=1996|volume=7|pages=609–626|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-3437-8_35|series=Nonconvex Optimization and its Applications|isbn=978-1-4613-3439-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PNS is used in different applications where it can be used to find optimum process structures like:
* Process engineering: Chemical process designs and the Synthesis of chemical processes is applied in different case studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedler|first1=F.|last2=Varga|first2=J.B.|last3=Fan|first3=L.T.|title=Decision-mapping for design and synthesis of chemical processes: applications to reactor-network synthesis|journal=Chemical Engineering Science|date=1995|volume=50|issue=11|pages=1755–1768|doi=10.1016/0009-2509(95)00034-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0009250995000343}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalauz|first1=K.|last2=Sule|first2=Z.|last3=Bertok|first3=B.|last4=Friedler|first4=F.|last5=Fan|first5=L.T.|title=Extending Process-network Synthesis Algorithms with Time Bounds for Supply Network Design|journal=Chemical Engineering Transactions|date=2012|volume=29|doi=10.3303/CET1229044|url=http://www.aidic.it/cet/12/29/044.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Optimum energy technology networks for regional and urban energy systems: In case of regional and urban energy planning the financially most feasible solution for resource systems is selected as target value.

[[File:Lambda lc.svg|thumb|250px|The lowercase [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter λ ([[lambda]]) is an unofficial symbol of the field of programming language theory. This usage derives from the [[lambda calculus]], a [[model of computation]] introduced by [[Alonzo Church]] in the 1930s and widely used by programming language researchers. It graces the cover of the classic text ''[[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]]'', and the title of the so-called [[Lambda Papers]], written by [[Gerald Jay Sussman]] and [[Guy Steele]], the developers of the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] [[programming language]].]]

'''Programming language theory''' ('''PLT''') is a branch of [[computer science]] that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of [[programming language]]s and their individual [[Programming language#Elements|features]].  It falls within the discipline of [[computer science]], both depending on and affecting [[mathematics]], [[software engineering]], [[linguistics]] and even [[cognitive science]].  It is a well-recognized branch of computer science, and an active research area, with results published in numerous [[Academic journal|journals]] dedicated to PLT, as well as in general computer science and engineering publications.

== History ==

In some ways, the history of programming language theory predates even the development of programming languages themselves.  The [[lambda calculus]], developed by [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] in the 1930s, is considered by some to be the world's first programming language, even though it was intended to [[Model of computation|''model'']] computation rather than being a means for programmers to [[Computer programming|''describe'']] algorithms to a computer system.  Many modern [[functional programming language]]s have been described as providing a "thin veneer" over the lambda calculus,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ModelsOfComputation&lt;/ref&gt; and many are easily described in terms of it.

The first programming language to be invented was [[Plankalkül]], which was designed by [[Konrad Zuse]] in the 1940s, but not publicly known until 1972 (and not implemented until 1998).  The first widely known and successful [[high-level programming language]] was [[Fortran]], developed from 1954 to 1957 by a team of [[IBM]] researchers led by [[John Backus]].  The success of FORTRAN led to the formation of a committee of scientists to develop a "universal" computer language; the result of their effort was [[ALGOL 58]].  Separately, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] of [[MIT]] developed the [[Lisp programming language]] (based on the lambda calculus), the first language with origins in academia to be successful.  With the success of these initial efforts, programming languages became an active topic of research in the 1960s and beyond.

Some other key events in the history of programming language theory since then:

=== 1950s ===
* [[Noam Chomsky]] developed the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] in the field of [[linguistics]]; a discovery which has directly impacted programming language theory and other branches of computer science.

=== 1960s ===
* The [[Simula]] language was developed by [[Ole-Johan Dahl]] and [[Kristen Nygaard]]; it is widely considered to be the first example of an [[object-oriented programming language]]; Simula also introduced the concept of [[coroutine]]s.
* In 1964, [[Peter Landin]] is the first to realize [[Alonzo Church|Church]]'s [[lambda calculus]] can be used to model programming languages. He introduces the [[SECD machine]] which "interprets" lambda expressions.
* In 1965, Landin introduces the [[J operator]], essentially a form of [[continuation]].
* In 1966, Landin introduces [[ISWIM]], an abstract computer [[programming language]] in his article ''The Next 700 Programming Languages''. It is influential in the design of languages leading to the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] programming language.
* In 1966, [[Corrado Böhm]] introduced the programming language [[CUCH]] (Curry-Church).&lt;ref&gt;[[Corrado Böhm|C. Böhm]] and W. Gross (1996). Introduction to the CUCH. In E. R. Caianiello (ed.), ''Automata Theory'', p. 35-64/&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1967, [[Christopher Strachey]] publishes his influential set of lecture notes ''[[Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages]]'', introducing the terminology ''[[Value (computer science)|R-values]]'', ''[[Value (computer science)|L-values]]'', ''[[parametric polymorphism]]'', and ''[[ad hoc polymorphism]]''.
* In 1969, [[J. Roger Hindley]] publishes ''The Principal Type-Scheme of an Object in Combinatory Logic'', later generalized into the [[Hindley&amp;ndash;Milner]] [[type inference]] algorithm.
* In 1969, [[Tony Hoare]] introduces the [[Hoare logic]], a form of [[axiomatic semantics]].
* In 1969, [[William Alvin Howard]] observed that a "high-level" [[proof calculus|proof system]], referred to as [[natural deduction]], can be directly interpreted in its [[intuitionistic]] version as a typed variant of the [[model of computation]] known as [[lambda calculus]]. This became known as the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]].

=== 1970s ===
* In 1970, [[Dana Scott]] first publishes his work on [[denotational semantics]].
* In 1972, [[logic programming]] and [[Prolog]] were developed thus allowing computer programs to be expressed as mathematical logic.
* A team of scientists at [[Xerox PARC]] led by [[Alan Kay]] develop [[Smalltalk]], an object-oriented language widely known for its innovative development environment.
* In 1974, [[John C. Reynolds]] discovers [[System F]]. It had already been discovered in 1971 by the mathematical logician [[Jean-Yves Girard]].
* From 1975, [[Gerald Jay Sussman]] and [[Guy Steele]] develop the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme programming language]], a Lisp dialect incorporating [[lexical scoping]], a unified namespace, and elements from the [[actor model]] including first-class [[continuation]]s.
* Backus, at the 1977 [[ACM Turing Award]] lecture, assailed the current state of industrial languages and proposed a new class of programming languages now known as [[function-level programming]] languages.
* In 1977, [[Gordon Plotkin]] introduces [[Programming Computable Functions]], an abstract typed functional language.
* In 1978, [[Robin Milner]] introduces the [[Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm]] for the [[ML programming language]]. [[Type theory]] became applied as a discipline to programming languages, this application has led to tremendous advances in type theory over the years.

=== 1980s ===
* In 1981, [[Gordon Plotkin]] publishes his paper on [[structured operational semantics]].
* In 1988, [[Gilles Kahn]] published his paper on [[natural semantics]].
* There emerged [[process calculus|process calculi]], such as the [[Calculus of Communicating Systems]] of [[Robin Milner]], and the [[Communicating sequential processes]] model of [[C. A. R. Hoare]], as well as similar models of concurrency such as the [[actor model]] of [[Carl Hewitt]].
* In 1985, the release of [[Miranda (programming language)|Miranda]] sparks an academic interest in lazy-evaluated pure functional programming languages. A committee was formed to define an open standard resulting in the release of the Haskell 1.0 standard in 1990.
* [[Bertrand Meyer]] created the methodology [[Design by contract]] and incorporated it into the [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel programming language]].

=== 1990s ===
* [[Gregor Kiczales]], Jim Des Rivieres and [[Daniel G. Bobrow]] published the book ''[[The Art of the Metaobject Protocol]]''.
* [[Eugenio Moggi]] and [[Philip Wadler]] introduced the use of [[Monads in functional programming|monads]] for structuring programs written in [[functional programming language]]s.

== Sub-disciplines and related fields ==

There are several fields of study which either lie within programming language theory, or which have a profound influence on it; many of these have considerable overlap. In addition, PLT makes use of many other branches of [[mathematics]], including [[computability theory]], [[category theory]], and [[set theory]].

=== Formal semantics ===
{{main|Formal semantics of programming languages}}
Formal semantics is the formal specification of the behaviour of computer programs and programming languages. Three common approaches to describe the semantics or "meaning" of a computer program are [[denotational semantics]], [[operational semantics]] and [[axiomatic semantics]].

=== Type theory ===
{{main|Type theory}}
Type theory is the study of [[type system]]s; which are "a tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin C. Pierce. 2002. Types and Programming Languages. MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Many programming languages are distinguished by the characteristics of their type systems.

=== Program analysis and transformation ===
{{main|Program analysis|Program transformation}}
Program analysis is the general problem of examining a program and determining key characteristics (such as the absence of classes of [[Software bug|program errors]]). Program transformation is the process of transforming a program in one form (language) to another form.

=== Comparative programming language analysis ===
Comparative programming language analysis seeks to classify programming languages into different types based on their characteristics; broad categories of programming languages are often known as [[programming paradigm]]s.

=== Generic and metaprogramming ===
[[Metaprogramming]] is the generation of higher-order programs which, when executed, produce programs (possibly in a different language, or in a subset of the original language) as a result.

=== Domain-specific languages ===
[[Domain-specific language]]s are languages constructed to efficiently solve problems of a particular part of domain.

=== Compiler construction ===
{{main|Compiler construction}}
[[Compiler]] theory is the theory of writing ''compilers'' (or more generally, ''translators''); programs which translate a program written in one language into another form.  The actions of a compiler are traditionally broken up into ''syntax analysis'' ([[wikt:scan|scan]]ning and [[parsing]]), ''semantic analysis'' (determining what a program should do), ''[[Compiler optimization|optimization]]'' (improving the performance of a program as indicated by some metric; typically execution speed) and ''[[Code generation (compiler)|code generation]]'' (generation and output of an equivalent program in some target language; often the [[instruction set]] of a CPU).

=== Run-time systems ===
[[Run-time system|Runtime systems]] refers to the development of programming language [[runtime environment]]s and their components, including [[virtual machine]]s, [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], and [[foreign function interface]]s.

== Journals, publications, and conferences ==

Conferences are the primary venue for presenting research in programming languages. The most well known conferences include the [[Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages]] (POPL), [[Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation]] (PLDI), the [[International Conference on Functional Programming]] (ICFP), and the International Conference on Object Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and Applications ([[OOPSLA]]).

Notable journals that publish PLT research include the ''[[ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems]]'' (TOPLAS), ''[[Journal of Functional Programming]]'' (JFP), ''[[Journal of Functional and Logic Programming]]'', and ''[[Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation]]''.

RBC is an approach that can be used to integrate the theory of roles into [[Computer supported cooperative work|Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)]] systems and other computer-based systems. It consists of a set of concepts, principles, mechanisms and methods. RBC presents challenges and benefits not found in traditional CSCW systems.

Even though we proposed RBC from the point of view of CSCW, we could expand RBC to more fields. RBC can be divided into two categories: special RBC and general RBC.&lt;ref name=Introduction/&gt; Special RBC means role-based CSCW or HCI.&lt;ref name=Collaboration/&gt;&lt;ref name=role&gt;Zhu, H., "Role Mechanisms in Collaborative Systems", International Journal of Production Research, vol. 44, no. 1, Jan. 2006, pp. 181-193.&lt;/ref&gt; To perform better [[system analysis]], design, implementation, application and evaluations, it is hoped to apply role theory to CSCW or Human Computer Interaction (HCI) systems. Therefore, the gap can be bridged between their developers and the sociologists who are more concerned with the usability of CSCW systems.

{{Computer hacking}}
A '''security hacker''' is someone who seeks to breach defenses and [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] weaknesses in a [[Computer|computer system]] or [[computer network|network]]. Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit, protest, information gathering,&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Ira. ''Spies Among Us: How to Stop the Spies, Terrorists, Hackers, and Criminals You Don't Even Know You Encounter Every Day.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. 2005. pg. 92. {{ISBN|9780764589904}}.&lt;/ref&gt; challenge, recreation,&lt;ref name="crackdown" /&gt; or to evaluate system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against potential hackers. The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the computer underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blomquist|first=Brian|date=May 29, 1999|url=http://archive.nypost.com/a/475198|title=FBI's Web Site Socked as Hackers Target Feds|newspaper=New York Post}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- historical precedent, takes precedence --&gt;

There is a longstanding [[Hacker|controversy]] about the term's true meaning. In this controversy, the term ''hacker'' is reclaimed by [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|computer programmers]] who argue that it refers simply to someone with an advanced understanding of computers and computer networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-1.5.0.dos.txt|title= The Hacker's Dictionary|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and that '''''cracker''''' is the more appropriate term for those who break into computers, whether computer criminal ([[#Black hat|black hats]]) or computer security expert ([[White hat (computer security)|white hats]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://stallman.org/archives/2012-sep-dec.html#06_December_2012_%28Ecuadorian_white_hat_cracker_freed%29 Political notes from 2012: September–December]. stallman.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/C/cracker.html |title=Jargon File: Cracker |first=Eric S. |last=Raymond |quote=Coined ca. 1985 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of hacker }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 article concluded that "... the black-hat meaning still prevails among the general public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yagoda |first1=Ben |title=A Short History of "Hack"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-short-history-of-hack |work=The New Yorker |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{tone inline|date=August 2016}}

==History==
{{Further|Timeline of computer security hacker history}}
[[File:Stering.jpg|thumb|[[Bruce Sterling]], author of ''[[The Hacker Crackdown]]'']]
In computer security, a hacker is someone who focuses on security mechanisms of computer and network systems. While including those who endeavor to strengthen such mechanisms, it is more often used by the [[mass media]] and popular culture to refer to those who seek access despite these security measures. That is, the media portrays the 'hacker' as a villain. Nevertheless, parts of the subculture see their aim in correcting security problems and use the word in a positive sense. White hat is the name given to ethical computer hackers, who utilize hacking in a helpful way. White hats are becoming a necessary part of the information security field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Tracey|title=Ethical hackers: putting on the white hat|journal=Network Security|date=22 July 2011|volume=2011|issue=7|pages=10–13|doi=10.1016/s1353-4858(11)70075-7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They operate under a code, which acknowledges that breaking into other people's computers is bad, but that discovering and exploiting security mechanisms and breaking into computers is still an interesting activity that can be done ethically and legally. Accordingly, the term bears strong connotations that are favorable or pejorative, depending on the context.

The subculture around such hackers is termed network hacker subculture, hacker scene, or computer underground. It initially developed in the context of [[phreaking]] during the 1960s and the microcomputer [[Bulletin board system|BBS scene]] of the 1980s. It is implicated with ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]'' and the ''[[alt.2600]]'' newsgroup.

In 1980, an article in the August issue of ''[[Psychology Today]]'' (with commentary by [[Philip Zimbardo]]) used the term "hacker" in its title: "The Hacker Papers". It was an excerpt from a Stanford Bulletin Board discussion on the addictive nature of computer use. In the 1982 film ''[[Tron]]'', Kevin Flynn ([[Jeff Bridges]]) describes his intentions to break into ENCOM's computer system, saying "I've been doing a little hacking here". CLU is the [[software]] he uses for this. By 1983, hacking in the sense of breaking computer security had already been in use as computer jargon,&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg1-81-MM-DD.txt 1981 version of the ''Jargon File''], entry "hacker", last meaning.&lt;/ref&gt; but there was no public awareness about such activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Computer hacking: Where did it begin and how did it grow?|publisher=WindowSecurity.com|date=October 16, 2002|url=http://www.windowsecurity.com/whitepapers/Computer_hacking_Where_did_it_begin_and_how_did_it_grow_.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the release of the film ''[[WarGames]]'' that year, featuring a computer intrusion into [[NORAD]], raised the public belief that computer security hackers (especially teenagers) could be a threat to national security. This concern became real when, in the same year, a gang of teenage hackers in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], known as [[The 414s]], broke into computer systems throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], including those of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] and [[Security Pacific Bank]].&lt;ref name = "drzmzu"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Elmer-DeWitt|first=Philip|title=The 414 Gang Strikes Again|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|page=75|date=August 29, 1983|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949797,00.html|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case quickly grew media attention,&lt;ref name = "drzmzu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=September 27, 1983|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 17-year-old Neal Patrick emerged as the spokesman for the gang, including a cover story in ''[[Newsweek]]'' entitled "Beware: Hackers at play", with Patrick's photograph on the cover.&lt;ref name = "iophas"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Beware: Hackers at play|newspaper=Newsweek|pages=42–46, 48|date=September 5, 1983|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Newsweek'' article appears to be the first use of the word ''hacker'' by the mainstream media in the pejorative sense.

Pressured by media coverage, congressman [[Dan Glickman]] called for an investigation and began work on new laws against computer hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50606-2002Jun26.html|accessdate=2006-04-14|title=Timeline: The U.S. Government and Cybersecurity | date=2003-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated180"&gt;David Bailey, "Attacks on Computers: Congressional Hearings and Pending Legislation," sp, p. 180, 1984 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
Neal Patrick testified before the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on September 26, 1983, about the dangers of computer hacking, and six bills concerning computer crime were introduced in the House that year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated180"/&gt; As a result of these laws against computer criminality, white hat, [[grey hat]] and black hat hackers try to distinguish themselves from each other, depending on the legality of their activities. These moral conflicts are expressed in [[Loyd Blankenship|The Mentor]]'s "[[The Hacker Manifesto]]", published 1986 in ''[[Phrack]]''.

Use of the term hacker meaning computer criminal was also advanced by the title "Stalking the Wily Hacker", an article by [[Clifford Stoll]] in the May 1988 issue of the ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''. Later that year, the release by [[Robert Tappan Morris, Jr.]] of the so-called [[Morris worm]] provoked the popular media to spread this usage. The popularity of Stoll's book ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]'', published one year later, further entrenched the term in the public's consciousness.

==Classifications==
Several subgroups of the computer underground with different attitudes use different terms to demarcate themselves from each other, or try to exclude some specific group with whom they do not agree.

[[Eric S. Raymond]], author of ''[[Jargon File|The New Hacker's Dictionary]]'', advocates that members of the computer underground should be called crackers. Yet, those people see themselves as hackers and even try to include the views of Raymond in what they see as a wider hacker culture, a view that Raymond has harshly rejected. Instead of a hacker/cracker dichotomy, they emphasize a spectrum of different categories, such as [[white hat (computer security)|white hat]], [[grey hat]], [[#Black hat|black hat]] and [[script kiddie]]. In contrast to Raymond, they usually reserve the term ''cracker'' for more malicious activity.

According to Ralph D. Clifford, a ''cracker'' or ''cracking'' is to "gain unauthorized access to a computer in order to commit another crime such as destroying information contained in that system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===White hat===
{{Main article|White_hat_(computer_security)|l1=White hat}}
A [[white hat (computer security)|white hat hacker]] breaks security for non-malicious reasons, either to test their own security system, perform [[penetration test]]s, or [[vulnerability assessment]]s for a client - or while working for a security company which makes security software. The term is generally synonymous with [[Hacker ethic|ethical hacker]], and the EC-Council,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eccouncil.org/ EC-Council]. eccouncil.org&lt;/ref&gt; among others, have developed certifications, courseware, classes, and online training covering the diverse arena of ethical hacking.&lt;ref name="hacker hats"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilhelm |first=Douglas |title=Professional Penetration Testing |year=2010 |publisher=Syngress Press |isbn=978-1-59749-425-0 |page=503 |chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black hat===
{{Main article|Black hat}}
A "black hat" hacker is a hacker who "violates computer security for little reason beyond maliciousness or for personal gain" (Moore, 2005).&lt;ref name="Moore2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robert|title=Cybercrime: Investigating High Technology Computer Crime|year=2005|publisher=Matthew Bender &amp; Company|isbn=1-59345-303-5|page=258}}Robert Moore&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Richard Stallman]], to contrast the maliciousness of a criminal hacker versus the spirit of playfulness and exploration in [[hacker culture]], or the ethos of the [[white hat hacker]] who performs hacking duties to identify places to repair or as a means of legitimate employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien, Marakas|first=James, George|title=Management Information Systems |year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill/ Irwin|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-752217-9|pages=536–537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black hat hackers form the stereotypical, illegal hacking groups often portrayed in popular culture, and are "the epitome of all that the public fears in a computer criminal".&lt;ref name="moore2006"&gt;{{cite book

===Grey hat===
{{Main article|Grey hat}}
A grey hat hacker lies between a black hat and a white hat hacker. A grey hat hacker may surf the Internet and hack into a computer system for the sole purpose of notifying the administrator that their system has a security defect, for example. They may then offer to correct the defect for a fee.&lt;ref name="moore2006" /&gt; Grey hat hackers sometimes find the defect of a system and publish the facts to the world instead of a group of people. Even though grey hat hackers may not necessarily perform hacking for their personal gain, unauthorized access to a system can be considered illegal and unethical.

===Script kiddie===
A [[script kiddie]] (also known as a ''skid'' or ''skiddie'') is an unskilled hacker who breaks into computer systems by using automated tools written by others (usually by other black hat hackers), hence the term script (i.e. a prearranged plan or set of activities) kiddie (i.e. kid, child—an individual lacking knowledge and experience, immature),&lt;ref name="Andress 10"&gt;{{cite book |title=CIW Security Professional |last=Andress |first=Mandy |author2=Cox, Phil |author3=Tittel, Ed  |year=2001 |publisher=Wiley|location=New York, NY |isbn=0-7645-4822-0 |page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually with little understanding of the underlying concept.

===Hacktivist===
A hacktivist is a hacker who utilizes technology to publicize a social, ideological, religious or political message.

[[Hacktivism]] can be divided into two main groups:
* [[Cyberterrorism]]&amp;nbsp;— Activities involving [[website defacement]] or [[denial-of-service attack]]s; and,
* [[Freedom of information]]&amp;nbsp;— Making information that is not public, or is public in non-machine-readable formats, accessible to the public.

==Attacks==
{{Main article|Computer security}}
{{Computer security}}

A typical approach in an attack on Internet-connected system is:
# [[Network enumeration]]: Discovering information about the intended target.
# [[Vulnerability (computing)|Vulnerability analysis]]: Identifying potential ways of attack.
# [[Exploit (computer security)|Exploitation]]: Attempting to compromise the system by employing the vulnerabilities found through the vulnerability analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Ajay; Klavinsky, Thomas and Laliberte, Scott
(March 15, 2002) [http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=25916 Security Through Penetration Testing: Internet Penetration]. informit.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to do so, there are several recurring tools of the trade and techniques used by computer criminals and security experts.

===Security exploits===
{{Main article|Exploit (computer security)}}

A security exploit is a prepared application that takes advantage of a known weakness.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.htbridge.com/publication/the_growing_hacking_threat_to_websites.pdf |title=The Growing Hacking Threat to Websites: An Ongoing Commitment to Web Application Security |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Chris |last2=Martinez |first2=Richard |publisher=Frost &amp; Sullivan |accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples of security exploits are [[SQL injection]], [[cross-site scripting]] and [[cross-site request forgery]] which abuse security holes that may result from substandard programming practice. Other exploits would be able to be used through [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[PHP]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]], [[Telnet]] and some Web pages. These are very common in Web site and Web domain hacking.

===Techniques===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
;Vulnerability scanner
:A [[vulnerability scanner]] is a tool used to quickly check computers on a network for known weaknesses. Hackers also commonly use [[port scanner]]s. These check to see which ports on a specified computer are "open" or available to access the computer, and sometimes will detect what program or service is listening on that port, and its version number. ([[Firewall (computing)|Firewalls]] defend computers from intruders by limiting access to ports and machines, but they can still be circumvented.)

;Finding vulnerabilities
:Hackers may also attempt to find vulnerabilities manually. A common approach is to search for possible vulnerabilities in the code of the computer system then test them, sometimes [[reverse engineering]] the software if the code is not provided.

;Brute-force attack
:Password guessing. This method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used, because of the time a brute-force search takes.&lt;ref&gt;Kerner, Sean Michael. "Sentry MBA Uses Credential Stuffing To Hack Sites." ''Eweek'' (2016): 8. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 7 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Password cracking
:[[Password cracking]] is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. Common approaches include repeatedly trying guesses for the password, trying the most common passwords by hand, and repeatedly trying passwords from a "dictionary", or a text file with many passwords.

;Packet analyzer
:A [[packet analyzer]] ("packet sniffer") is an application that captures data packets, which can be used to capture passwords and other [[data in transit]] over the network.

;Spoofing attack (phishing)
:A [[spoofing attack]] involves one program, system or website that successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data and is thereby treated as a trusted system by a user or another program&amp;nbsp;— usually to fool programs, systems or users into revealing confidential information, such as user names and passwords.

;Rootkit
:A [[rootkit]] is a program that uses low-level, hard-to-detect methods to subvert control of an operating system from its legitimate operators. Rootkits usually obscure their installation and attempt to prevent their removal through a subversion of standard system security. They may include replacements for system binaries, making it virtually impossible for them to be detected by checking [[Process (computing)|process tables]].

;Social engineering
:In the second stage of the targeting process, hackers often use [[Social engineering (security)|Social engineering]] tactics to get enough information to access the network. They may contact the system administrator and pose as a user who cannot get access to his or her system. This technique is portrayed in the 1995 film ''Hackers'', when protagonist Dade "Zero Cool" Murphy calls a somewhat clueless employee in charge of security at a television network. Posing as an accountant working for the same company, Dade tricks the employee into giving him the phone number of a modem so he can gain access to the company's computer system.

:Hackers who use this technique must have cool personalities, and be familiar with their target's security practices, in order to trick the system administrator into giving them information. In some cases, a help-desk employee with limited security experience will answer the phone and be relatively easy to trick. Another approach is for the hacker to pose as an angry supervisor, and when his/her authority is questioned, threaten to fire the help-desk worker. Social engineering is very effective, because users are the most vulnerable part of an organization. No security devices or programs can keep an organization safe if an employee reveals a password to an unauthorized person.

:Social engineering can be broken down into four sub-groups:
:* '''''Intimidation''''' As in the "angry supervisor" technique above, the hacker convinces the person who answers the phone that their job is in danger unless they help them. At this point, many people accept that the hacker is a supervisor and give them the information they seek.
:* '''''Helpfulness'''''  The opposite of intimidation, helpfulness exploits many people's natural instinct to help others solve problems. Rather than acting angry, the hacker acts distressed and concerned. The help desk is the most vulnerable to this type of social engineering, as (a.) its general purpose is to help people; and (b.) it usually has the authority to change or reset passwords, which is exactly what the hacker wants.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Samuel T. C. "Helping The Hacker? Library Information, Security, And Social Engineering." ''Information Technology &amp; Libraries'' 25.4 (2006): 222-225. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 7 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''''Name-dropping''''' The hacker uses names of authorized users to convince the person who answers the phone that the hacker is a legitimate user him or herself. Some of these names, such as those of webpage owners or company officers, can easily be obtained online. Hackers have also been known to obtain names by examining discarded documents ([[garbage picking|"dumpster diving"]]).
:* '''''Technical'''''  Using technology is also a way to get information. A hacker can send a fax or email to a legitimate user, seeking a response that contains vital information. The hacker may claim that he or she is involved in law enforcement and needs certain data for an investigation, or for record-keeping purposes.

;Trojan horses
:A [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] is a program that seems to be doing one thing but is actually doing another. It can be used to set up a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]] in a computer system, enabling the intruder to gain access later. (The name refers to the [[Trojan Horse|horse]] from the [[Trojan War]], with the conceptually similar function of deceiving defenders into bringing an intruder into a protected area.)

;Computer virus
:A [[computer virus|virus]] is a self-replicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other executable code or documents. By doing this, it behaves similarly to a [[Virus|biological virus]], which spreads by inserting itself into living cells. While some viruses are harmless or mere hoaxes, most are considered malicious.

;Computer worm
:Like a virus, a [[computer worm|worm]] is also a self-replicating program. It differs from a virus in that (a.) it propagates through computer networks without user intervention; and (b.) does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Nonetheless, many people use the terms "virus" and "worm" interchangeably to describe any self-propagating program.

;Keystroke logging
:A [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]] is a tool designed to record ("log") every keystroke on an affected machine for later retrieval, usually to allow the user of this tool to gain access to confidential information typed on the affected machine. Some keyloggers use virus-, trojan-, and rootkit-like methods to conceal themselves. However, some of them are used for legitimate purposes, even to enhance computer security. For example, a business may maintain a keylogger on a computer used at a [[point of sale]] to detect evidence of employee fraud.

;Attack patterns
:[[Attack patterns]] are defined as series of repeatable steps that can be applied to simulate an attack against the security of a system. They can be used for testing purposes or locating potential vulnerabilities. They also provide, either physically or in reference, a common solution pattern for preventing a given attack.

'''Tools and Procedures'''
:A thorough examination of hacker tools and procedures may be found in Cengage Learning's E|CSA certification workbook.&lt;ref name="E|CSA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Penetration Testing: Procedures &amp; Methodologies |last=Press |first=EC-Council |year=2011 |publisher=CENGAGE Learning|location=Clifton, NY |isbn=1435483677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer underground&lt;ref name="crackdown"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Sterling  | first = Bruce  | authorlink = Bruce Sterling  | title = [[The Hacker Crackdown]]  | year = 1993  | publisher = IndyPublish.com  | location = McLean, Virginia  | isbn = 1-4043-0641-2  | chapter = Part 2(d)  | page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; has produced its own specialized slang, such as [[leet|1337]]speak. Its members often advocate freedom of information, strongly opposing the principles of copyright, as well as the rights of free speech and privacy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Writing software and performing other activities to support these views is referred to as [[hacktivism]]. Some consider illegal cracking ethically justified for these goals; a common form is [[website defacement]]. The computer underground is frequently compared to the Wild West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Jordan, Tim  |author2=Taylor, Paul A. | pages = 133–134  | title = Hacktivism and Cyberwars  | publisher = Routledge  | year = 2004  | isbn = 978-0-415-26003-9  | quote = Wild West imagery has permeated discussions of cybercultures.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for hackers to use aliases to conceal their identities.

===Hacker groups and conventions===
{{Main article|Hacker conference|Hacker group}}

The computer underground is supported by regular real-world gatherings called [[hacker convention]]s or "hacker cons". These events include [[SummerCon]] (Summer), [[DEF CON]], [[HoHoCon]] (Christmas), [[ShmooCon]] (February), [[Black Hat Conference|BlackHat]], [[Chaos Communication Congress]], AthCon, Hacker Halted, and HOPE.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Local Hackfest groups organize and compete to develop their skills to send a team to a prominent convention to compete in group pentesting, exploit and forensics on a larger scale. Hacker groups became popular in the early 1980s, providing access to hacking information and resources and a place to learn from other members. Computer [[bulletin board systems]] (BBSs), such as the Utopias, provided platforms for information-sharing via dial-up modem. Hackers could also gain credibility by being affiliated with elite groups.&lt;ref name="thomas"/&gt;

===Netherlands===
* Article 138ab of [[Law of the Netherlands#Criminal law|Wetboek van Strafrecht]] prohibits ''computervredebreuk'', which is defined as intruding an automated work or a part thereof with intention and against the law. Intrusion is defined as access by means of:
**Defeating [[Computer security|security measures]]
**By technical means
**By false signals or a false [[key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]]
**By the use of stolen [[User (computing)|usernames]] and [[password]]s.
Maximum imprisonment is one year or a fine of the fourth category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/TweedeBoek/TitelV/Artikel138ab/geldigheidsdatum_27-12-2012 Artikel 138ab]. Wetboek van Strafrecht, December 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

{{usc|18|1030}}, more commonly known as the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]], prohibits unauthorized access or damage of "protected computers". "Protected computers" are defined in {{USCSub|18|1030|e|2}} as:

* A computer exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the United States Government, or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, used by or for a financial institution or the United States Government and the conduct constituting the offense affects that use by or for the financial institution or the Government.
* A computer which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States;

The maximum imprisonment or fine for violations of the ''Computer Fraud and Abuse Act'' depends on the severity of the violation and the offender's history of violations under the ''Act''.

==Hacking and the media==

===Hacker magazines===
{{Main category|Hacker magazines}}
The most notable hacker-oriented print publications are ''[[Phrack]]'', ''[[Hakin9]]'' and ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]''. While the information contained in hacker magazines and [[ezine]]s was often outdated by the time they were published, they enhanced their contributors' reputations by documenting their successes.&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Douglas |title=Hacker Culture |year=2003 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0-8166-3346-3 |page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hackers in fiction===
{{See also|List of fictional hackers}}
Hackers often show an interest in fictional [[cyberpunk]] and [[cyberculture]] literature and movies. The adoption of [[fictional]] [[pseudonym]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swabey|first=Pete|title=Data leaked by Anonymous appears to reveal Bank of America's hacker profiling operation|url=http://www.information-age.com/it-management/risk-and-compliance/123456840/data-leaked-by-anonymous-appears-to-reveal-bank-of-america-s-hacker-profiling-operation|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=Information Age|date=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; symbols, values and [[metaphor]]s from these works is very common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hackers and Viruses: Questions and Answers|url=http://www.scienzagiovane.unibo.it/English/hackers/6-faq.html|work=Scienzagiovane|publisher=[[University of Bologna]]|accessdate=21 February 2014|date=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Books====
* The [[cyberpunk]] novels of [[William Gibson]]—especially the [[Sprawl trilogy]]—are very popular with hackers.&lt;ref name="ntygibson"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/opinion/editorial-observer-a-prince-of-cyberpunk-fiction-moves-into-the-mainstream.html |title=A Prince of Cyberpunk Fiction Moves Into the Mainstream |first=Brent |last=Staples |date=May 11, 2003|quote=Mr. Gibson's novels and short stories are worshiped by hackers |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20662">A '''social skill''' is any [[social competence|competence]] facilitating [[Interpersonal relationship|interaction]] and [[Social Communication|communication]] with others where [[social rule]]s and [[Interpersonal relationship|relations]] are created, communicated, and changed in [[Language|verbal]] and nonverbal ways. The process of learning these skills is called [[socialization]]. For socialization, interpersonal skills are essential to relate to one another. Interpersonal skills are the interpersonal acts a person uses to interact with others, which are related to dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, and control vs. autonomy categories (Leary, 1957). Positive interpersonal skills include [[persuasion]], [[active listening]], [[delegation]], and [[stewardship]], among others. A healthy Social interest ([[wikt:Gemeinschaftsgefühl|Gemeinschaftsgefühl]]) that involves more than being in a group is required for well-adjusted social skills. [[Social psychology]] is the academic discipline that does research related to social skills and studies how skills are learned by an individual through changes in attitude, thinking, and behavior.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Enumeration and categorization==
Social skills are the tools that enable people to communicate, learn, ask for help, get needs met in appropriate ways, get along with others, make friends, develop healthy relationships, protect themselves, and in general, be able to interact with the society harmoniously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTpYF4okJbAC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Teaching Social Skills to Youth: A Step-by-step Guide to 182 Basic to Complex Skills Plus Helpful Teaching Techniques|first1=Tom P.|last1=Dowd|first2=Jeff|last2=Tierney|date=8 October 2017|publisher=Boys Town Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9781889322698}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social skills build essential character traits like trustworthiness, respectfulness, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. These traits help build an internal moral compass, allowing individuals to make good choices in thinking and behavior, resulting in social competence.

The important social skills identified by the [[Employment and Training Administration]] are:{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* Coordination – Adjusting actions in relation to others' actions.
* Mentoring – Teaching and helping others how to do something (e.g. a study partner).
* Negotiation – Discussion aimed at reaching an agreement. 
* Persuasion – The action or fact of persuading someone or of being persuaded to do or believe something. 
* Service Orientation – Actively looking for ways to evolve compassionately and grow psycho-socially with people.
* Social Perceptiveness – Being aware of others' reactions and able to respond in an understanding manner.

Social skills are goal oriented with both main goals and sub-goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popstoolkit.com/riskmanagement/module/step2/goalsetting.aspx|title=Goal Setting - Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Toolkit|website=www.popstoolkit.com|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a workplace interaction initiated by a new employee with a senior employee will first contain a main goal. This will gather information, and then the sub-goal will be to establish a rapport in order to obtain the main goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popstoolkit.com/riskmanagement/module/step2/subgoals.aspx|title=Sub-goals - Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Toolkit|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Takeo Doi in his study of consciousness distinguished this as ''tutemae'', meaning conventions and verbal expressions and ''honne'', meaning true motive behind the conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Takeo Doi|title=The Anatomy of Self: The Individual Versus Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=thrgxooX93oC|year=2001|publisher=Kodansha International|isbn=978-4-7700-2779-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of deficits==
Deficits in social skills were categorized by Gresham in 1998, as failure to recognize and reflect social skills, a failure to model appropriate models, and failure to perform acceptable behavior in particular situations in relation to developmental and transitional stages.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching Social Skills to Youth, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Social skill deficits are also a discouragement for children with behavioral challenges when it comes to adult adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schloss|first=Partrick J.|last2=Schloss|first2=Cynthia N.|last3=Wood|first3=Constance E.|last4=Kiehl|first4=Wendy S.|date=1986|title=A Critical Review of Social Skills Research with Behaviorally Disordered Students|jstor=23882274|journal=Behavioral Disorders|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.2307/23882274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===
Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from [[alcoholism]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} This is due to the neurotoxic [[effects of alcohol]] on the brain, especially the [[prefrontal cortex]] area of the brain.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} The social skills that are impaired by [[alcohol abuse]], include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, [[Semantic prosody|prosody]] perception problems, and [[theory of mind]] deficits.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} The ability to understand humor is also impaired in alcohol abusers.&lt;ref name="pmid18412750"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Uekermann J, Daum I |title=Social cognition in alcoholism: a link to prefrontal cortex dysfunction? |journal=Addiction |volume=103 |issue=5 |pages=726–35 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18412750 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02157.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impairments in social skills can also occur in individuals who suffer from [[fetal alcohol spectrum disorder]]s. These deficits persist throughout the affected people's lives, and may worsen over time due to the effects of aging on the brain.&lt;ref name="Kully-Martens-2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Kully-Martens | first1 = K. | last2 = Denys | first2 = K. | last3 = Treit | first3 = S. | last4 = Tamana | first4 = S. | last5 = Rasmussen | first5 = C. | title = A review of social skills deficits in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and prenatal alcohol exposure: profiles, mechanisms, and interventions. | journal = Alcohol Clin Exp Res | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 568–76 |date=Apr 2012 | doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01661.x | PMID = 22017360 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder===
People with [[ADHD]] and [[hyperkinetic disorder]]&lt;ref name=Banaschewski&amp;Rohde&gt;{{cite book|year=2009|editor1-last= Banaschewski |editor1-first= Tobias|editor2-last=Coghill|editor2-first= David |editor3-last= Danckaerts|editor3-first= Marina|isbn=9780191576010|title=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Hyperkinetic Disorder|publisher=OUP |location=Oxford, UK|first1=Tobias|last1=Banaschewski|first2=Louis|last2=Rohde|chapter= Phenomenology|pages=3–18|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=LQRUM5v_N1IC}}&lt;/ref&gt; often have difficulties with social skills, such as social interaction. Approximately half of ADHD children and adolescents will experience peer rejection, compared to 10–15 percent of non-ADHD youth. Adolescents with ADHD are less likely to develop close friendships and romantic relationships; they are usually regarded by their peers as immature or as social outcasts, with an exception for peers that have ADHD or related disorders themselves, or a high level of tolerance for such symptoms. As they begin to mature, however, it becomes easier to make such relationships. Training in social skills, behavioral modification, and medication have some beneficial effects. It is important for ADHD youth to form friendships with people who are not involved in deviant/delinquent activities and/or significant mental illness/developmental disabilities  in order to reducing emergence of later psychopathology. Poor peer relationships can contribute to [[major depression]], [[criminality]], school failure, and [[substance use disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid20490677"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikami AY |title=The importance of friendship for youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=181–98 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20490677 |pmc=2921569 |doi=10.1007/s10567-010-0067-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18822833"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Coleman WL |title=Social competence and friendship formation in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=Adolesc Med State Art Rev |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=278–99, x |date=August 2008 |pmid=18822833 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Romantic relationships are usually difficult in the adolescent and college age because of the lack of attention of non verbal cues such as flirting gestures, tone of voice, which may include misinterpretation if whether the person is romantically attracted to that person, along with the impulsiveness of "jumping into" relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, E. "Helping Teens with ADHD Foster Romantic Relationships." Health Central. 11 Feb 2013. Retrieved on 13 Mar 2018.https://www.healthcentral.com/article/helping-teens-with-adhd-foster-romantic-relationships&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
People with [[autistic spectrum disorders]] are often deficient in social skills. This is most likely the result of the lack of [[theory of mind]], which enables the person to understand other people's [[emotion]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The concept of social skills has been questioned in terms of autistic spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Romanczyk, Sara White, and Jennifer M. Gillis (2005): Social Skills Versus Skilled Social Behavior: A Problematic Distinction in Autism Spectrum Disorders. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention 2 (3),'' pp. 177–94 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In response for the needs of children with [[autism]], Romanczyk has suggested for adapting comprehensive model of social acquisitions with behavioral modification rather than specific responses tailored for social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-52008-006.pdf|author=Romanczyk, R. G.|author2=White, S.|author3=Gillis, J.

===Anxiety and depression===
Individuals with few opportunities to socialize with others often struggle with social skills. This can often create a downward spiral effect for people with mental illnesses like anxiety or depression. Due to [[Social anxiety|anxiety]] experienced from concerns with interpersonal evaluation and fear of negative reaction by others, surfeit expectations of failure or social rejection in socialization leads to avoiding or shutting down from social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/theory-knowledge/201604/the-behavioral-shutdown-theory-depression|title=The Behavioral Shutdown Theory of Depression|author=Gregg Henriques|date=2016-04-03|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who experience significant levels of social anxiety often struggle when communicating with others, and may have impaired abilities to demonstrate social cues and behaviors appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Angélico |first1= Antonio Paulo |last2= Crippa |first2= José Alexandre S. | last3= Louriero | first3= Sonia Regina | date= 2013 |title= Social Anxiety Disorder and Social Skills: A Critical Review of the Literature  |url= http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=89136226&amp;S=R&amp;D=asn&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNHX8kSeprU4zdnyOLCmr0%2Bep7NSsa64TLCWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPPt6nnhset55%2BS5febl8YwA  |journal= International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy |volume= 7 |issue= 4 |pages= 16–33 |doi= |access-date= 2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depression can also cause people to avoid opportunities to socialize, which impairs their social skills, and makes socialization unattractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Depression, Social Skills are Linked|url=http://web.sbs.arizona.edu/college/news/depression-poor-social-skills-are-linked|publisher=University of Arizona|accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-social behaviors ===
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace||Narcissism in the workplace|Anti-social behaviour}}

The authors of the book ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' explore psychopathy in workplace. The FBI consultants describe a five phase model of how a typical [[psychopath]] climbs to and maintains [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Many traits exhibited by these individuals include: [[superficial charm]], insincerity, egocentricity, manipulativeness, grandiosity, lack of empathy, low on agreeableness, exploitativeness, independence, rigidity, stubbornness and dictatorial tendencies. Babiak and Hare say for corporate psychopaths, success is defined as the best revenge and their problem behaviors are repeated "ad infinitum" due to little insight and their proto-emotions such as "anger, frustration, and rage" is [[Impression management|refracted]] as irresistible charm. The authors note that lack of [[emotional literacy]] and moral conscience is often confused with toughness, the ''ability'' to make hard decisions, and ''effective'' crisis management. Babiak and Hare also emphasizes a reality they identified with psychopaths from studies that psychopaths are not able to be influenced by any sort of therapy.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; [[Robert D.

At the University at Buffalo in New York, Emily Grijalva has investigated [[narcissism]] in business; she found there are two forms of narcissism: "vulnerable" and "[[grandiose]]".&lt;ref name="Haycock2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dean A. Haycock|title=Murderous Minds: Exploring the Criminal Psychopathic Brain: Neurological Imaging and the Manifestation of Evil|chapter=Successful, Unsuccessful, and Other Types of Psychopaths|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ_UAgAAQBAJ|date=4 March 2014|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-4804-4798-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is her finding that "moderate" level of grandiose narcissism is linked to becoming an effective manager. Grandiose narcissists are characterized as confident; they possess unshakable belief that they are superior, even when it's unwarranted. They can be charming, pompous show-offs, and can also be selfish, exploitative and entitled.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Grijalva, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270220807_Gender_Differences_in_Narcissism_A_Meta-Analytic_Review Gender Differences in Narcissism: A Meta-Analytic Review], Psychological Bulletin, December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Jens Lange and Jan Crusius at the University of Cologne, Germany associates "malicious-benign" envy within narcissistic social climbers in workplace. It is their finding that grandiose narcissists are less prone to low self-esteem and neuroticism and are less susceptible to the anxiety and depression that can affect vulnerable narcissists when coupled with envy. They characterize vulnerable narcissists as those who "believe they are special, and want to be seen that way–but are just not that competent, or charming." As a result, their self-esteem fluctuates a lot. They tend to be self-conscious and passive, but also prone to outbursts of potentially violent aggression if their inflated self-image is threatened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cengagesites.com/academic/assets/sites/schultz_ch04.pdf|title=Theory of Neurotic Needs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Boyatzis]] says this is an unproductive form of expression of emotions that the person can’t share constructively, which reflects lack of appropriate skills.&lt;ref&gt;HBR's 10 Must Reads on Collaboration&lt;/ref&gt; Eddie Brummelman, a social and behavioral scientist at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Brad Bushman at Ohio State University in Columbus says studies show that in western culture narcissism is on the rise from shifting focus on the self rather than on relationships and concludes all narcissism to be socially undesirable ("unhealthy feelings of superiority"). David Kealy at the University of British Columbia in Canada states that narcissism might aid temporarily but in the long run it is better to be true to oneself, have personal integrity, and be kind to others.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist Magazine, 9 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavior therapy===
{{Main|Behaviorism}}
To behaviorists, social skills are learned behaviors that allow people to achieve social [[reinforcement]]. According to Schneider &amp; Byrne (1985), who conducted a meta-analysis of social skills training procedures (51 studies), [[operant conditioning]] procedures for training social skills had the largest effect size, followed by [[observational learning|modeling]], coaching, and social cognitive techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, B.H. &amp; Byrne, B.M.

During [[heterosexual]] [[anal sex]], splash conception occurs when [[semen]] containing [[spermatozoon|sperm]] migrates from the [[anus]], across the [[perineum]], to the [[labia (genitalia)|labia]], and subsequently into the [[vagina]], causing the fertilization of an [[ovum]] followed by [[Conception (biology)|conception]] or [[pregnancy]].  This migration does not occur by virtue of the spermatozoa's tail propulsion, but rather due to gravity or other kinetic forces (such as that of a penis pulling out of an anus and dragging semen left on the tip, or being expelled from the anus due to said penis's recent ejaculation, across the perineum and onto the labia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="981">'''Statical determinacy''' is a term used in [[structural mechanics]] to describe a structure where force and moment equilibrium conditions alone can be utilized to calculate internal member actions.

Descriptively, a statically determinate structure can be defined as a structure where, if it is possible to find internal actions in equilibrium with external loads, those internal actions are unique. The structure has no possible states of self-stress, i.e. internal forces in equilibrium
with zero external loads are not possible.

Mathematically, this requires a [[stiffness matrix]] to have full rank.

A statically indeterminate structure can only be analyzed by including further information like material properties and deflections. Numerically, this can be achieved by using methods like matrix structural analyses and finite element analyses.

The '''storage of cultural heritage objects''' typically falls to the responsibility of cultural heritage institutions, or individuals. The proper storage of these objects can help to ensure a longer lifespan for the object with minimal damage or degradation. With so many different types of artifacts, materials, and combinations of materials, keepers of these artifacts often have considerable knowledge of the best practices in storing these objects to preserve their original state.

== Storage spaces ==
[[File:Shelves of military equipment at the Treloar Technology Centre in September 2012.JPG|thumb|Items being stored on shelves and the floor at the Australian War Memorial's [[Treloar Resource Centre]]]]
The process involved when creating a collections storage area usually involves determining the available resources, the needs of the specific collection, how the collection will be used, and the necessary space required based on the current collection and potential future acquisitions.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000423/042316eo.pdf |title=Protection of the cultural heritage: Museum collection storage |last1=Johnson |first1=E.Verner |last2=Horgan |first2=Joanne C. |publisher=United Nations, Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organizations |date=1979 |format=PDF |access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accessibility of objects in storage, as well as the need to retrieve them, will have an effect on the type of storage space desired. If only a small portion of the collection is regularly utilized, then a separate more easily accessible storage space may be chosen for these objects, while less utilized objects may be held in a less accessible area of the building, or an offsite facility.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;  In either case, collections storage spaces are typically separate from all other activity in order to decrease the potential for damage to the collection from theft, tracked in soil, excessive light exposure, etc.&lt;ref name=NPS2012&gt;{{cite book |title=Museum Handbook: Part I, Museums Collections |publisher=Department of the Interior, National Park Service |date=2012 |chapter=Chapter 7: Museum Collection Storage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well designed collections storage space is multi-layered, beginning with the building itself, a room, storage furniture, and packaging.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt; The more layers utilized the greater the protection from agents of deterioration.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt; It is generally agreed that storage spaces should not be at the top of the building or below grade, but attics and basements are often the most practical space for storage, so many institutions weigh the risks, and opt to upgrade these spaces in terms of structure, insulation, and/or vapor barriers to create a suitable space for storage.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;&lt;ref name=Swain&gt;{{cite book |last=Swain |first=Lynn |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Rebecca A. |editor2-last=Gilmore |editor2-first=Jean A. |title=MRM5: Museum Registration Methods 5th Ed. |publisher=The AAM Press |date=2010 |pages=293–299 |chapter=5H: Storage |isbn=9781933253152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type and size of the objects in the collection also help to determine where and how the storage space is set up. If the collection has many large heavy items, like furniture, the storage spaces typically have low shelving for these items, and require wide isles to move the objects, especially if they require large equipment like a forklift to be moved.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; In these cases, the doorways must be large enough to accommodate these large objects, and the floor structure must be reinforced to hold the weight of the collection.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt; If a collection consists of mostly small objects, then cabinets and shelving are a practical solution, while a collection of two-dimensional works might require flat drawers and hanging racks.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

== Environmental control ==
The climate control systems in collections storage typically include the control of temperature, [[relative humidity]], and a ventilation and filtration system to remove atmospheric pollutants like dust, chemicals, and micro-organisms.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; The basic idea of climate control is to keep the temperature and relative humidity at a steady rate so as to avoid expansion and contraction of materials, which can cause serious damage.&lt;ref name=MPH5&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/museum/policy/upload/mphi-5.pdf |title=Museum Property Handbook Volume I: Preservation and Protection of Museum Property: Chapter 5: Agents of Deterioration|publisher=Department of the Interior |format=PDF |access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate control is typically achieved by utilizing an [[HVAC]] system, though depending on weather patterns, these systems can often require a great deal of energy to run, which is a concern for many institutions.&lt;ref name=WAAC&gt;{{cite web|title=A Discussion of Research on the Effects of Temperature and Relative Humidity on Museum Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn18/wn18-3/wn18-307.html|website=WAAC Newsletter|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
Generally, keeping a lower temperature is better for collections storage, because chemical and biological reactions tend to increase as the temperature increases and structural damage is possible to objects made of materials such as wax, at high temperatures.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; The standard practice for temperature control for general collections objects is a temperature of 70&amp;nbsp;°F +/-2&amp;nbsp;°F, or 21&amp;nbsp;°C +/-2&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite book |last=Fisher |first=Genevieve |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Rebecca A. |editor2-last=Gilmore |editor2-first=Jean A. |title=MRM5: Museum Registration Methods 5th Ed. |publisher=The AAM Press |date=2010 |pages=287–292 |chapter=5G: Preventive Care |isbn=9781933253152}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some collections, there are specified temperature suggestions to protect delicate materials. For example, furs, paper archives, and textiles may be stored at a lower temperature between 41&amp;nbsp;°F to 50&amp;nbsp;°F (5-10&amp;nbsp;°C), and cellulose nitrate film is often isolated and stored below freezing, as it has the potential to ignite at 106&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt;

===Relative humidity===
[[File:Termoigrografo 01.jpg|thumb|Hygrothermograph]]
The standard practice for humidity control for collections objects is a relative humidity of 50% +/-5%, though the expenditures required to keep such a tight relative humidity have been shown to only offer modest prevention benefits.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt; As with temperature control, the main goal of the control of relative humidity to is avoid major fluctuations which can cause physical damage to objects, with long term seasonal changes causing greater damage than short term changes.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt; [[Hygroscopy|Hygroscopic]] materials such as wood, textiles, and bone, are especially sensitive to changes in humidity, as they swell and shrink according to the environment, which will cause deterioration over time.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; Mold growth occurs only when the relative humidity is about 70% or higher, and insect infestation is more common with a high relative humidity.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; A very low relative humidity, of about 35% or lower, can cause embrittlement of paper and adhesives, as well as cracking and warping of wood and ivory.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; Many museum objects are constructed of multiple materials, so in order to provide an appropriate relative humidity for the object as a whole, certain materials may be compromised.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt;

=== Monitoring Climate ===
An ongoing monitoring system is essential to the preventive care of objects in collections storage, as it helps to identify any problems, evaluate the effectiveness of corrective measures, and document the effect of extraordinary events such as water leaks, long periods of drought, or heavy rains.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; Hygrothermographs are a tool that constantly monitors both the temperature and relative humidity, and are fairly reliable if properly calibrated, a task that must be completed at least every three months if not more frequently.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; The value with these devices is that they constantly record the data onto graphs that can be analyzed at a later time. [[Hygrometer]]s, thermometers, and thermohygrometers are also useful for determining the temperature and relative humidity of a space, but the most reliable tool is a psychrometer.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; [[Data logger]]s are becoming more popular in institutions as they are small, record data at desired intervals, and allow the data to be easily transferred to a computer in multiple formats including graphs and tables, which allows for easy collection and assessment of the data.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt;

== Lighting ==
Because damage from visible light and ultraviolet radiation is cumulative and irreversible, collections storage spaces tend to have few ambient light sources, such as windows, and often have lighting installed in multiple zones controlled by different switches, so that all of the lights do not have to be turned on when only a small area of the storage space is actively being used.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt; LED or UV-filtered fluorescent bulbs are generally recommended, as they save energy compared to incandescent bulbs, while quartz and halogen bulbs emit high levels of UV and infrared radiation as well as a significant amount of heat, which can cause increased deterioration of objects in the space.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

== Integrated pest management ==
[[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated pest management (IPM)]] is an intensive program that monitors for pests, such as insects and rodents, which may harm collections. This method utilizes traps to monitor the types of pests entering storage spaces, and to eliminate pest entrances and attractors.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Chemical treatments for pests are generally only utilized as a last resort, and with the advice of a professional, because they add toxic and potentially harmful chemicals to the storage space.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; To avoid attracting pests, collecting institutions typically avoid having exterior lighting focused around doors and windows, when possible, and also avoid using mercury vapor or tungsten lights.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

== Storage furniture ==
[[File:MN Warsaw. Interior painting store. 1966.jpg|thumb|MN Warsaw. Interior painting store. 1966]]
They type of objects in the collection, available space, and need for ease of accessibility tend to determine what type of storage system is utilized for a particular collection.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; There are many generic storage systems that can be purchased and modified to fit the needs of a specific collection, and this is generally more cost effective than having a system specially built.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; In small storage areas many institutions will utilize mobile systems that have shelving units on a track, which allows access to a desired aisle while the rest of the shelving units are pushed together.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

Wood storage furniture is typically avoided, even if painted, as it offgasses harmful acids, while often used metal storage equipment is typically made out of steel that is powder-coated with an epoxy finish, which is more durable than an acrylic or polyester finish.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

=== Storage racks ===
Sliding racks are typically used for the storage of framed works of art, where works are hung on a wire rack connected to tracks that are suspended from channels on the floor and ceiling, which keeps the racks from swaying.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; This type of system allows great variation, as the distance between racks can be adjusted to accommodate large or small frames, and works can be organized to make the most of the space while keeping them in their upright position to avoid damage.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; These types of sliding rack systems can also be a closed unit, where the end of each rack has a panel with a gasket and closed walls at either end, or each individual rack can be a sealed space in itself, which is typically used for textile display or visible storage systems, where the objects are encased in a transparent rack.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Mobile racks can also be utilized to hang textiles, where the textiles can either be draped over a bar, or supported by hooks attached to frames.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Racks can also be mounted to the walls of storage spaces, utilizing the perimeter space of a storage area, which is safest for framed objects that should not be moved often, such as framed pastel drawings.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

=== Shelving and cabinets ===
[[File:Backstage Pass at the British Museum 10.jpg|thumb|Backstage Pass at the British Museum 10]]
Open steel shelving systems are cost effective, and easily adjusted to accommodate objects of various sizes.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Deeper shelves are often utilized for larger objects, while smaller objects are typically stored on narrower shelves to avoid overcrowding, and potential damage when retrieving objects from the back of the shelf.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Shelving units can accommodate the height of the ceiling if necessary, but it is safer for objects and those working with them to keep shelves within an easily accessible reach.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; If open shelving is used, it is suggested that the objects are placed in boxes, or otherwise covered to protect the objects from dust and other environmental factors.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Metal shelving is prone to carry vibrations, so if objects are not individually housed in boxes or otherwise stabilized, it is recommended that the shelves be lined with a protective padding.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; It is also necessary for cabinets to be stabilized by being bolted to the floor or walls, and for shelves to have restraining bars, to avoid tipping, especially in earthquake prone areas.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

Cabinets tend to be versatile and easily accommodate a wide variety of objects with adjustable shelving and drawers, and have the ability to close the objects off to avoid damage from dust and light even if the objects are not in boxes or otherwise covered.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

=== Drawers ===
Drawers can be open or closed, and contained within cabinets or stand as a unit of their own. Open drawer systems leave room between drawers and are often adjustable to accommodate objects of different heights by placing the drawers in the desired runners or leaving unused drawers out completely.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Closed drawer systems offer more protection from dust and light exposure than the open drawer systems, and the drawers are typically shorter to accommodate small objects, textiles, and two-dimensional objects.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Dividers can be made to fit in shallow drawers to create individual compartments for small objects like coins, or small individual boxes can be utilized in the same fashion, which allows the entire box to be removed so the object itself is handled less.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;
[[File:IMA Conservation Technician 2.JPG|thumb|An archival tube role for a Chinese scroll.]]

=== Textile rolls ===
Rolls are a preferred way to store certain textiles because they help to avoid creasing or stretching. The method typically involves rolling textiles around a cardboard tube that has been covered with acid-free paper, or some other barrier, and then a plastic cover is wrapped around the rolled textile, with the ends loosely tied, to protect from dust.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Rolled textiles can be placed on a shelf, but a preferred method is to suspend them horizontally by the ends of the tubes, which keeps the textiles from being damaged by pressure.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

Archival housing materials are utilized to protect objects from dust, light, and vibrations that could potentially harm objects in the storage space, if they were not otherwise protected.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Commonly used office supplies do not typically have archival qualities, and to ensure that collections objects are not affected by these materials, institutions do not use materials that have not been tested, to ensure they are inert and therefore will not place the collections at risk.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

=== Archival boxes ===
[[File:Archival collection.JPG|thumb|Archival boxes on open shelves.]]
Boxes can add an additional layer of microclimate insulation and make moving objects easier.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Archival boxes are typically made of corrugated, acid-free paper, either buffered or unbuffered, or they can be made of corrugated polyethylene or polypropylene plastic.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

=== Archival papers ===
All paper products will acidify over time, so even archival [[acid-free paper]] products used for storage are typically replaced every few years.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Archival acid-free paper products can be either buffered or unbuffered. Unbuffered paper has a neutral pH and is used for housing photographs, textiles, and most other types of objects, while buffered paper, which is impregnated with calcium carbonate and has an alkaline pH, is used for storing paper objects.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; The buffered paper absorbs the acid that paper objects emit and keeps the micro-environment from becoming overly acidic for a longer period of time.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

*Acid-free [[Glassine|glassine paper]] is typically used to cover [[friability|friable]] materials or objects with oily/tacky surfaces, as it is smooth and does not create static electricity, though it is only used for short periods of time because it deteriorates quickly.&lt;ref name=NPS1999&gt;{{cite book |title=Museum Handbook: Part I, Museums Collections |publisher=Department of the Interior, National Park Service |date=1999 |chapter=Chapter 6: Handling, Packing, and Shipping}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Soft unbuffered acid-free tissue paper is used for covering a variety of objects, creating padding in boxes, and for placing in the folds of textiles to prevent creasing.&lt;ref name=NPS1999 /&gt;
*Acid-free folders are valuable for storing unframed prints and documents in flat files.&lt;ref name=NPS1999 /&gt;
[[File:Ceramic ring housed in blue board box.JPG|thumb|Ceramic ring housed in archival box with Ethafoam pad and plastic covered viewing window.]]

=== Archival plastics ===
Most common plastics contain chlorinated compounds and plasticizers, which can migrate out and harm objects.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Polyethylene and polyester are considered archival plastics because they do not offgas harmful chemicals, but they can produce static electricity in a low RH, so they should be avoided around friable objects.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

*Polyester film, or [[BoPET|Mylar]], is a good tool for paper preservation and can act as a vapor barrier.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;
*[[Tyvek]] is a textile-like material created from high-density polyethylene, and works as an alternative to glassine paper, but its fabric-like quality also allows it to be draped over objects and utilized in numerous ways where paper products are not ideal.&lt;ref name=NPS1999 /&gt;
*Polypropylene or polyethylene bags come in a multitude of sizes, with or without zip closures, and are often utilized for small objects, but may trap moisture and cause molding if sealed closed.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;&lt;ref name=MPH8&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/museum/policy/upload/mphi-8.pdf|title=Museum Property Handbook Volume I: Preservation and Protection of Museum Property: Chapter 8: Handling, Packing, and Shipping |publisher=Department of the Interior|format=PDF|access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archival fabrics ===
Fabrics are utilized for wrapping or padding objects, or in the form of string to secure wrappings or labels onto objects. Archival fabrics are typically washed before use to remove sizing chemicals and to soften the material, and are never dyed.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

*Cotton fabrics are often used, typically in the form of twill tape and  threads, which allow for an easy way to secure wrappings, secure objects within containers, and to tie tags to objects with registration information.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;
*Unbleached muslin is often used to wrap sculptures and textiles.&lt;ref name=NPS1999 /&gt;
*Polyester batting is often utilized for padding objects, especially textiles, which often require padding between folds to prevent creasing.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

=== Archival foams ===
Foam rubber and urethane foams offgas harmful fumes, and are highly flammable, so they are typically avoided in collection storage spaces.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

*Polyethylene microfoam, commonly called Ethafoam, is an inert foam that is useful for lining drawers and shelves, padding or cradling objects, or for mounting objects.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; It is commercially available in numerous sizes and can easily be cut and shaped to fit the users needs.

== Open Storage ==
[[File:Visual storage at V&amp;A - 1 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|250px|Visual storage at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]]]
Many museums are beginning to opt for [[Visible storage|open storage]] spaces that allow visitors to see more of the collections and behind the scenes activities. While this practice has become popular for the enjoyment of visitors and the transparency of institutions, the practice allows for increased light exposure, dust levels, and other environmental concerns that could be potentially harmful to the objects.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

Museums with open storage:
*[[The Broad]]
*[[Brooklyn Museum|The Brooklyn Museum]]
*[[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]
*[[Museum of Arts and Sciences (Daytona Beach)]]
*[[Polytechnic Museum|The Polytechnic Museum]]

'''Sympathetic magic''', also known as '''imitative magic''', is a type of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] based on imitation or correspondence.

==Similarity and contagion==
It has been said that the theory of sympathetic magic was first developed by Sir [[James George Frazer]] in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1889); [[Richard Andree]], however, anticipates Frazer, writing of 'Sympathie-Zauber' in his 1878 ''Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche''. Frazer further subcategorised sympathetic magic into two varieties: that relying on similarity, and that relying on contact or 'contagion':
{{Quote |If we analyze the principles of thought on which magic is based, they will probably be found to resolve themselves into two: first, that like produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause; and, second, that things which have once been in contact with each other continue to act on each other at a distance after the physical contact has been severed. The former principle may be called the Law of Similarity, the latter the Law of Contact or Contagion. From the first of these principles, namely the Law of Similarity, the magician infers that he can produce any effect he desires merely by imitating it: from the second he infers that whatever he does to a material object will affect equally the person with whom the object was once in contact, whether it formed part of his body or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3623/3623-h/3623-h.htm#c3section1 | publisher = Bartleby | title = The Golden Bough | year = 1922 | chapter = 3: Sympathetic Magic; Part 1: The Principles of Magic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Imitation==
Imitation involves using [[effigies]], [[fetishes]] or [[poppet]]s to affect the environment of people, or occasionally people themselves.  [[Voodoo doll]]s are an example of fetishes used in this way. Such as using a lock of hair on the doll creating a "link" between the doll and the person the hair came from so whatever happens to the doll will also happen on the person.

==Correspondence==
[[Correspondence (theology)|Correspondence]] is based on the idea that one can influence something based on its relationship or resemblance to another thing. Many popular beliefs regarding properties of plants, fruits and vegetables have evolved in the [[traditional medicine|folk-medicine]] of different societies owing to sympathetic magic. This include beliefs that certain herbs with [[yellow]] sap can cure [[jaundice]], that [[walnut]]s could strengthen the brain because of the nuts' resemblance to brain, that [[red beet]]-juice is good for the blood, that phallic-shaped roots will cure [[male impotence]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Harrison| first = Regina | title = Signs, songs, and memory in the Andes: translating Quechua language and culture| publisher = [[University of Texas Press]]| year = 1989| page = 178| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t6RkAAAAMAAJ | isbn = 978-0-292-77627-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional societies believed that an effect on one object can cause an analogous effect on another object, without an apparent causal link between the two objects. For instance, many folktales feature a villain whose "life" exists in another object, and who can only be killed if that other object is destroyed. (Examples including [[Sauron]]'s [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and the [[Russian folktale]] of [[Koschei the Deathless]]. Compare [[Horcrux]] and [[lich]].) [[Mircea Eliade]] wrote that in [[Uganda]], a [[barren woman]] is thought to cause a barren garden, and her husband can seek a divorce on purely economic grounds.&lt;ref name= " Haper &amp; Row - 1976 - A Mircea Eliade Reader - "&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Mircea Eliade | first = Mircea | last = Eliade |title=Myths, Rites, Symbols: A Mircea Eliade Reader|editor1-first =Wendell C | editor1-last = Beane | editor2-first = William G | editor2-last = Doty|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]| year=1976|page =385|isbn=978-0-06-090510-1|oclc= 2136392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many societies have been documeted as believing that, instead of requiring an image of an individual, influence can be exerted using something that they have touched or used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Rehabilitation interventions: Ideas based on a South Pacific example|author-last=Gregory|author-first=R. J.| journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|volume=18|issue=1|date=1996|doi=10.3109/09638289609167089|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the inhabitants of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna, Vanuatu]] in the 1970s were cautious when throwing away food or losing a fingernail, as they believed these small scraps of personal items could be used to cast a spell causing fevers. Similarly, an 18th-century compendium of Russian [[Folk Orthodoxy|folk magic]] describes how someone could be influenced through sprinkling cursed salt on a path frequently used by the victim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Witchcraft and Medicine in Pre-Petrine Russia|author-last=Zguta|author-first=Russell|journal=The Russian Review|volume=37|issue=4|date=1978|p=446|jstor=128509}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 15th-century [[Hwi-bin Kim|crown princess of Joseon Korea]] is recorded as having cut her husband's lovers' shoes into pieces and burnt them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=世宗實錄 |trans-title=[[Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty|Veritable Records of Sejong]]|date=1454|url=http://sillok.history.go.kr/search/inspectionMonthList.do?id=kda|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses about prehistoric sympathetic magic==
The term is most commonly used in [[archaeology]] in relation to [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s such as those in [[North Africa]] and at [[Lascaux]] in [[France]].  The theory is one of prehistoric human behavior, and is based on studies of more modern [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. The idea is that the paintings were made by [[Cro-Magnon]] [[Shamanism|shaman]]s. The shamans would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a [[trance]] state and then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing power out of the cave walls themselves. This goes some way towards explaining the remoteness of some of the paintings (which often occur in deep or small caves) and the variety of subject matter (from prey animals to [[predator]]s and human hand-prints). In his book ''Primitive Mythology'', [[Joseph Campbell]] stated that the paintings "...were associated with the magic of the hunt." For him, this sympathetic magic was akin to a ''[[participation mystique]]'', where the paintings, drawn in a sanctuary of "timeless principle", were acted upon by rite.

In 1933, [[Leo Frobenius]], discussing [[Cave painting#Africa|cave paintings in North Africa]], pointed out that many of the paintings did not seem to be mere depictions of animals and people. To him, it seemed as if they were acting out a hunt before it began, perhaps as a consecration of the animal to be killed. In this way, the pictures served to secure a successful hunt. While others interpreted the cave images as depictions of hunting accidents or of ceremonies, Frobenius believed it was much more likely that "...what was undertaken [in the paintings] was a consecration of the animal effected not through any real confrontation of man and beast but by a depiction of a concept of the mind."

In 2005, Francis Thackeray published a paper in the journal Antiquity, in which he recognised that there was a strong case for the principle of sympathetic magic in southern Africa in prehistory.  For example, a rock engraving from Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa (dated at 4000 years before the present, BP) showed a zebra which had probably been "symbolically wounded", with incisions on the rump being associated with wounds.  Ochre on the engraved slab could represent blood. A prehistoric rock painting at Melikane in Lesotho shows what appear to be men (shamans) bending forward like animals, with two sticks to represent the front legs of an antelope.  Thackeray suggests that these men, perhaps shamans or "medicine-men" dressed under animal skins, were associated with hunting rituals of the kind recorded by H. Lichtenstein in 1812 in South Africa, in which a hunter simulated an antelope which was symbolically killed by other hunters, in the belief that this was essential for a successful hunt.  Such rituals could be represented in prehistoric art such as paintings at Melikane in Lesotho.  Thackeray suggests that the Melikane therianthropes are associated with both trance and the principle of sympathetic hunting magic  In 2005, in the journal Antiquity, Francis Thackeray suggests that there is even a photograph of such rituals, recorded in 1934 at Logageng in the southern Kalahari, South Africa. Such rituals may have been closely associated with both roan antelope and eland, and other animals.

In the Brandberg in Namibia, in the so-called "White Lady" panel recorded by the Abbe Henri Breuil and Harald Pager, there are "symbolic wounds" on the belly of a gemsbok-like therianthrope (catalogued as T1), which might relate to the principle of sympathetic hunting magic and trance, as suggested by Thackeray in 2013.

At the Apollo 11 cave in Namibia, Erich Wendt discovered mobile art about 30,000 years old, including a stone broken in two pieces, with a gemsbok-like therianthrope that closely resembles the Brandberg therianthrope which Thackeray catalogues as T1.   Both examples of art may be related to sympathetic hunting magic and shamanism.

In 2013 Thackeray emphasised that in southern Africa, the principle of sympathetic hunting magic and shamanism (trance) were not mutually exclusive.

However, as with all [[prehistory]], it is impossible to be certain due to the limited evidence and the many pitfalls associated with trying to understand the prehistoric mindset with a modern [[Mind#Evolutionary history of the human mind|mind]].

==Popular culture==
The concept of sympathetic magic features prominently in the [[The Kingkiller Chronicle|Kingkiller Chronicle]] novel series by [[Patrick Rothfuss]].

Merricat Blackwood in [[Shirley Jackson]]'s ''[[We Have Always Lived in the Castle]]'' is a practitioner of sympathetic magic.

In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]'', sympathetic magic is practiced prominently.

The music duo Charming Disaster has a song called "Sympathetic Magic". A duet between the magic user and her target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://charmingdisaster.bandcamp.com/track/sympathetic-magic|title=Sympathetic magic lyrics|last=|first=|date=|website=Bandcamp.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taplow Court''' is a large [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] house in the village of [[Taplow]]  in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]], which has served as the national headquarters for the [[Soka Gakkai International]] of the United Kingdom (SGI-UK) since 1988.

==Locale==
The [[Taplow burial]], a 7th-century [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] burial mound, is in the grounds of the house, near the [[parish church]] which is scenically positioned  on a hill directly above [[Maidenhead Bridge]] and the town's riverside district. The mound was excavated in 1883 and a number of treasures were discovered, of quality of the early Saxon centuries surpassed only by [[Sutton Hoo]] in 1939.

==Manor House==
There has been a manor house on the site since before the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066. The manor was owned by the monks at [[Merton Priory]] until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. It was then owned by the [[Hampson Baronets|Hampson family]] in the 17th century, coming under attack during the [[English Civil War]]. Throughout  the 18th century and through to the 1850s, Taplow Court was home to the [[George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Earl and Countess of Orkney]] who has also owned the adjacent [[Cliveden]].

===19th Century Rebuilding===
From 1852, Taplow Court became the home of the Grenfell family, purchased by [[Charles Pascoe Grenfell]] in August of that year.&lt;ref name="Sheahan1862"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheahan|first=James Joseph|title=History and topography of Buckinghamshire: comprising a general survey of the county, preceded by an epitome of the early history of Great Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9oWAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA852|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=1862|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts|isbn=978-0-8048-3390-5|page=852}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family had it rebuilt in 1855, as it is dated, etched into the masonry. The exterior in an early [[Tudor architecture|Tudor style]] and the interior (with its central glazed hall rising the full height of the house) in [[Romanesque architecture]]. A [[listed building]] in the starting category of Grade II, it is built of red brick partly dressed in light stone and has a slate roof, has four storeys with 2 stone [[stringcourse]]s carried round the building as drip moulds over the windows. It has a central projection with a porch. Here its heavy oak door is set in recess with a [[Norman architecture|Norman style arch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1165286|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:taplow court inside.jpg|thumb|An interior room at Taplow Court]]

It was inherited in 1867 by his grandson [[William Grenfell, 1st Baron Desborough]] where a prominent social role was also played by [[Ethel Fane|his wife Ettie]].&lt;ref name=ettie&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/ettie-by-richard-davenport-hines-1785255.html Ettie], book review, The Independent, Retrieved 1 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Their son was war poet [[Julian Grenfell]].  They prominently hosted an aristocratic and elite group known as "[[the Souls]]" at the house. Visitors included [[Henry Irving]], [[Vita Sackville-West]], [[Edward VII]] when [[Prince of Wales]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Patrick Shaw-Stewart|Patrick Shaw Stewart]], [[Edith Wharton]] and [[Oscar Wilde]].

A [[stické]] court was built by Lord Desborough at Taplow Court in 1892 and the dimension of this court subsequently became the standard size of the court.

After [[World War II]], Taplow Court was owned by British Telecommunications Research, a subsidiary of [[Plessey|Plessey Electronics]] until 1988 when it became a [[Soka Gakkai International]] Buddhist centre.

== Background ==
A [[Turing machine]] is a basic model of [[computation]].  Some [[Turing machine]]s might be specific to doing particular calculations.  For example, a Turing machine might take input which comprises two numbers and then produce output which is the product of their [[multiplication]].  Another Turing machine might take input which is a list of numbers and then give output which is those numbers [[sorting|sorted]] in order.

A [[Turing machine]] which has the ability to simulate any other Turing machine is called [[Computationally universal|universal]] - in other words, a Turing machine (TM) is said to be a [[universal Turing machine]] (or UTM) if, given any other TM, there is a some input (or "header") such that the first TM given that input "header" will forever after behave like the second TM.

An interesting [[mathematical]] and [[philosophical]] question then arises.  If a [[universal Turing machine]] is given random input (for suitable definition of [[random]]), how probable is it that it remains universal forever?

== Definition ==
Given a [[prefix-free code|prefix-free]] [[Turing machine]], the '''universality probability''' of it is the [[probability]] that it remains [[universal Turing machine|universal]] even when every input of it (as a [[binary string]]) is prefixed by a random binary string. More formally, it is the [[probability measure]] of reals (infinite binary sequences) which have the property that every initial segment of them preserves the [[universal Turing machine|universality]] of the given Turing machine. This notion was introduced by the computer scientist [[Chris Wallace (computer scientist)|Chris Wallace]] and was first explicitly  discussed in print in an article by Dowe&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |author=Dowe, D.L. |title=Foreword re C.

Wallace |journal=Computer Journal |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=523–560 |date=5 September 2008 |doi=10.1093/comjnl/bxm117 |url=http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/51/5/523 }} (and [http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dld/Publications/2008/DLDowe_ForewordReCSWallace_CompJVol51Num5Sept2008pp523-560.pdf here])&lt;/ref&gt; (and a subsequent article&lt;ref&gt;*Dowe, D.

== Universality probabilities of prefix-free UTMs are non-zero ==
Although the universality probability of a [[Universal Turing Machine|UTM]] (UTM) was originally suspected to be zero, relatively simple proofs exist that the [[supremum]] of the set of universality probabilities is equal to 1, such as a proof based on [[random walk]]s&lt;ref&gt;*Hernandez-Orallo, J. &amp; Dowe, D. L. (2013), "On Potential Cognitive Abilities in the Machine Kingdom", [https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/11023 Minds and Machines], Vol. 23, Issue 2, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11023-012-9299-6 pp179-210]&lt;/ref&gt; and a proof in Barmpalias and Dowe (2012).
Once one has one [[prefix-free code|prefix-free]] UTM with a non-zero universality probability, it immediately follows that all [[prefix-free code|prefix-free]] [[Universal Turing Machine|UTM]]s have non-zero universality probability.
Further, because the [[supremum]] of the set of universality probabilities is 1 and because the set {{math|{ {{sfrac|''m''| 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{!}} 0 &amp;lt; ''n'' &amp;amp; 0 &amp;lt; ''m'' &amp;lt; 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;} }}
is [[dense set|dense]] in the interval [0, 1],
suitable constructions of UTMs
(e.g., if ''U'' is a UTM, define a
UTM ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(0''s'') halts for all strings ''s'',
U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1''s'') = ''U''(''s'') for all s) gives that the set of universality probabilities is
[[dense set|dense]] in the open interval (0, 1).

== Characterization and randomness of universality probability ==
Universality probability was thoroughly studied and characterized by Barmpalias and Dowe in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barmpalias, G. and Dowe D.L. |title=Universality probability of a prefix-free machine |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A |volume=370 |issue=1 | pages=3488–3511 |date=2012 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2011.0319|pmid=22711870 |bibcode=2012RSPTA.370.3488B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Seen as [[real number]]s, these probabilities were completely characterized in terms of notions in [[computability theory]]
and [[algorithmic information theory]].
It was shown that when the underlying machine is universal, these numbers are highly [[Algorithmically random sequence|algorithmically random]]. More specifically, it is [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]] random relative to the third iteration of the [[halting problem]]. In other words, they are random relative to null sets that can be defined with four quantifiers in [[Peano arithmetic]]. Vice versa, given such a highly random number{{clarify|date=August 2015}} (with appropriate approximation properties) there is a Turing machine with universality probability that number.

== Relation with Chaitin's constant ==
Universality probabilities are very related to the [[Chaitin's constant|Chaitin constant]], which is the halting probability of a universal prefix-free machine. In a sense, they are complementary to the halting probabilities of universal machines relative to the third iteration of the [[halting problem]]. In particular, the universality probability can be seen as the non-halting probability of a machine with oracle the third iteration of the halting problem. Vice versa, the non-halting probability of any prefix-free machine with this highly non-computable oracle is the universality probability of some prefix-free machine.

== Probabilities of machines as examples of highly random numbers ==
Universality probability provides a concrete and somewhat natural example of a highly random number (in the sense of [[algorithmic information theory]]). In the same sense, Chaitin's constant provides a concrete example of a random number (but for a much weaker notion of algorithmic randomness).

'''Upland and lowland''' are conditional descriptions of a [[plain]] based on elevation above sea level.

In studies of the '''[[ecology]] of [[freshwater]] [[river]]s''', [[habitat]]s are classified as '''upland and lowland'''.

==Definitions==
&lt;!--PLEASE NOTE: the section heading "Definitions" is linked to from several other articles; please be cautious of changing it.--&gt;
Upland and lowland are portions of plain that are conditionally categorized by their elevation above the [[sea level]]. Lowlands are usually no higher than {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}}, while uplands are somewhere around {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}}. On rare occasions, certain lowlands such as [[Caspian Depression]] lie below [[sea level]].

Upland habitats are cold, clear and rocky whose rivers are fast-flowing in mountainous areas; lowland habitats are warm with slow-flowing rivers found in relatively flat lowland areas, with water that is frequently coloured by [[sediment]] and organic matter.

These classifications overlap with the geological definitions of "upland" and "lowland".  In [[geology]] an "upland" is generally considered to be land that is at a higher elevation than the [[alluvial plain]] or [[stream terrace]], which are considered to be "lowlands". The term "bottomland" refers to low-lying alluvial land near a river.

Many freshwater fish and invertebrate communities around the world show a pattern of specialisation into upland or lowland river habitats. Classifying rivers and streams as upland or lowland is important in freshwater ecology as the two types of river habitat are very different, and usually support very different populations of fish and invertebrate species.

==Upland==
In freshwater ecology, upland rivers and [[stream]]s are the fast-flowing rivers and streams that drain elevated or mountainous country, often onto broad [[alluvial plain]]s (where they become lowland rivers). However, altitude is not the sole determinant of whether a river is upland or lowland. Arguably the most important determinants are that of stream power and [[stream gradient]]. Rivers with a course that drops in altitude rapidly will have faster water flow and higher stream power or "force of water". This in turn produces the other characteristics of an upland river - an [[incised course]], a [[river bed]] dominated by [[bedrock]] and coarse sediments, a [[riffle]] and pool structure and cooler water temperatures. Rivers with a course that drops in altitude very slowly will have slower water flow and lower force. This in turn produces the other characteristics of a lowland river - a meandering course lacking rapids, a river bed dominated by fine sediments and higher water temperatures. Lowland rivers tend to carry more suspended [[sediment]] and organic matter as well, but some lowland rivers have periods of high water clarity in seasonal low-flow periods.

The generally clear, cool, fast-flowing waters and bedrock and coarse sediment beds of upland rivers encourage fish species with limited temperature tolerances, high oxygen needs, strong swimming ability and specialised reproductive strategies to prevent eggs or larvae being swept away.  These characteristics also encourage invertebrate species with limited temperature tolerances, high oxygen needs and ecologies revolving around coarse sediments and interstices or "gaps" between those coarse sediments,

==Lowland==
[[Image:Manaus-Amazon-NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Amazon River]] near [[Manaus]], [[Brazil]], an example of a lowland river habitat.]]

The generally more turbid, warm, slow-flowing waters and fine sediment beds of lowland rivers encourage fish species with broad temperature tolerances and greater tolerances to low oxygen levels, and life history and breeding strategies adapted to these and other traits of lowland rivers.  These characteristics also encourage invertebrate species with broad temperature tolerances and greater tolerances to low oxygen levels and ecologies revolving around fine sediments or alternative habitats such as submerged woody debris ("snags") or submergent [[macrophyte]]s ("water weed").
