The '''1946 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race''' was the second annual running of the "blue water classic" [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22387699 |title=Sydney-Hobart Race Begins Today. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=26 December 1946 |accessdate=27 December 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was hosted by the [[Cruising Yacht Club of Australia]] based in [[Sydney]]. 

The inaugural race in 1945 had been planned as a [[cruising (maritime)|cruise]], and no thoughts were given to repeating the event. However it became a race at the suggestion of visiting [[Royal Navy]] captain John Illingworth, and the race proved so popular a repeat was planned.

The second race began on [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]], at noon on [[Boxing Day]] (26 December 1946), before heading south for 630 nautical miles (1,170&amp;nbsp;km) through the [[Tasman Sea]], past [[Bass Strait]], into [[Storm Bay]] and up the [[Derwent River, Tasmania|Derwent River]], to cross the finish line in [[Hobart, Tasmania]].

The 1946 expanded fleet comprised more than double the vessels of the inaugural event with19 starters. Of the 19 starters, 8 yachts were forced to retire, and the remaining 11 made it successfully to Hobart, with ''Morna''  captained by Claude Plowman winning line honours, and ''Christina'' captained by JR Bull taking handicap honours on adjusted time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69066004 |title=MORNA FIRST ACROSS LINE IN YACHT RACE. |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]] |location=Burnie, Tas. |date=1 January 1948 |accessdate=26 December 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abbey Park''' was a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Grimsby]], [[Lincolnshire]], England. It was the home ground of [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] between 1889 and 1899.

==History==
Abbey Park was built as a replacement for Grimsby's previous ground, Clee Park. It consisted of a main seated stand on the northern touchline of the pitch and a raised bank on the southern touchline. Behind the eastern end of the pitch there was a 300-seat stand moved from Clee Park, alongside an 800-capacity terrace. The dressing rooms were located in the south-east corner of the ground.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p11, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground was opened on 30 August 1889 with a friendly match against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]], which Grimsby won 6–1. Grimsby became founder members of the [[Football League Second Division]] in 1892, and the first League game at Abbey Park on 3 September 1892 saw Grimsby beat [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] 2–1 in front of 5,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

The record attendance of 10,000 was set on 26 December 1896 for a match against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] (with Grimsby winning 3–2) and equalled for an 8 April 1897 game against [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]], a game which Grimsby won 3–1. In 1899 Grimsby moved to [[Blundell Park]]; the final match at Abbey Park was played against [[Darwen F.C.|Darwen]] on 15 April 1899, with the 9–2 victory also being the ground's record home win.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

A housing development was later built on the site.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

'''Schaumburg Boomers Stadium''' often referred to simply as '''Boomers Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Schaumburg, Illinois]], formerly known as '''Alexian Field'''. It is now home to the [[Schaumburg Boomers]] of the [[Frontier League]] which began play in May 2012 and captured the first-ever professional baseball championship for Schaumburg in 2013. It is primarily used for [[baseball]], and was the home field of the [[Schaumburg Flyers]] baseball team from 1999 through 2010 before the Boomers resurrected the facility for pro baseball in 2012.

Schaumburg Boomers Stadium opened in 1999 and the park holds 7,365 people for a baseball game or over 10,000 for a concert or other non-baseball event.  Its field dimensions mimic those of Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]], and the land the stadium is built on was originally purchased in the mid-1980s as a hopeful site for the '''New Wrigley Field''', had the [[City of Chicago]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]] not come to terms to bring night baseball to the North Side. Some pro [[lacrosse]] as well as [[Major North American professional sports teams|professional]] and [[amateur]] softball has also been played at Schaumburg Boomers Stadium due to the late start (mid-May) of the independent baseball season.

The Stadium itself is located west of [[Interstate 355|I-355]] off the [[Elgin-O'Hare Expressway]].  Now called '''Schaumburg Boomers Stadium,''' the [[Alexian Brothers]] Medical Center in nearby [[Elk Grove Village, Illinois|Elk Grove]] purchased the naming rights to the ballpark in 2000. The Stadium was host to the [[Schaumburg Flyers]] from its opening through the end of the 2010 season. At that point, the village and park district which owned the stadium began eviction proceedings against the Flyers for failure to pay $551,800 in back rent. On February 24, 2011, a [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] court ruled the Flyers could be evicted, ordered the now defunct team to pay the back rent, and the naming rights contract was terminated when there was no professional baseball played in the park in 2011.

From 2009-10, the Wheaton College Thunder, a Division III baseball program, played its home games at Schaumburg Boomers Stadium, and since 2008 the Dominican University Stars another Division III baseball program has played a majority of it home games at Schaumburg Boomers Stadium. In 2011, the [[Roosevelt University#Athletics|Roosevelt Lakers]], an NAIA baseball program, played its home games at the stadium as well.

Later that year, in September 2011, Chicago attorney [[Patrick A. Salvi]] was awarded ownership of a [[Frontier League]] franchise that began play in May 2012.  Salvi is also the owner of the American Association's [[Gary SouthShore RailCats]].  The franchise is known as the '''Schaumburg Boomers''' named after the "booming dance" of the male Greater Prairie Chicken and the team earned a 54-42 record during its Inaugural Season, falling one win short of a playoff berth.

In just the franchise's second season in 2013, the Schaumburg Boomers captured the first-ever pro baseball championship for the Village of Schaumburg in impressive fashion. After capturing the league's best record in the regular season (59-37), the Boomers became the first team in the Frontier League's 14-year history to sweep through the playoffs with a 6-0 record en route to claiming the 2013 Frontier League Championship. In doing so, the Boomers made good on a promise to win title in the "first 100 years or your money back." The guarantee was featured on a billboard announcing the new team in March 2012 before the club's first season got underway.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20130917/sports/709179692/&lt;/ref&gt;

During construction, Cape Town Stadium was unofficially known as Green Point Stadium, the name of [[Green Point Stadium|an older stadium]] demolished to make way for the new stadium. During October 2009, the city asked for the public to propose names for the new stadium and the name Cape Town Stadium was chosen.&lt;ref name="naming" /&gt;

In December 2017, plans for a new name were underway.

The stadium is adjacent to the site of the original 18,000 seater stadium [[Green Point Stadium]]. It replaces a portion of the Metropolitan Golf Club site which has now been realigned.

The previous stadium, which was partly demolished in 2007, was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] used mainly for football matches, and was the home ground of [[Santos Football Club (South Africa)|Santos Football Club]] and [[Ajax Cape Town FC|Ajax Cape Town]] at different points. It also hosted music concerts, including the November 2003 [[46664 (concerts)|46664 Concert]] for the benefit of AIDS victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Construction of the Cape Town Stadium, located on the [[Green Point Common]], began in March 2007. In 33 months, joint contractors Murray &amp; Roberts and WBHO completed the project at a cost of R4.4billion – or approximately US$600million. The project architects were an association between GMP Architects of Germany and two local firms, Louis Karol and Associates and Point Architects. The structural engineers comprised a joint venture between BKS, Henry Fagan &amp; Partners, KFD Wilkinson, Goba, Iliso and Arcus Gibb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.travel/2010/faq/stadium/|title=CT Stadium Construction Information|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handing over==

Cape Town Stadium was officially handed over to the [[City of Cape Town]] on schedule on 14 December 2009. At a ceremony in front of over 200 invited guests and the media representatives from around the world, Cape Town Executive Mayor Alderman Dan Plato, received the keys to the stadium officially confirming the opening of Cape Town Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/FIFA2010/Newsandmedia/Pages/CapeTownStadiumhandedoveronschedule.aspx|publisher=City of Cape Town|title=Cape Town Stadium Opening|accessdate=9 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216194911/http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/FIFA2010/Newsandmedia/Pages/CapeTownStadiumhandedoveronschedule.aspx|archivedate=16 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage after the World Cup==
A consortium consisting of South Africa's Sail Group and French-based Stade de France were awarded the service contract to operate the stadium and ensure that it remains a sustainable multi-purpose venue after the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The consortium, called Business Venture Investments 1317, was involved in the management of the stadium from January 2009 onwards. The city municipality paid the consortium to manage the stadium up to and during the World Cup, after which the consortium will lease the stadium from the city for a period of not less than 10 years and not more than 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the World Cup, temporary rows of seating on either side on the top tier were replaced by events suites and clubrooms, reducing the stadium's capacity to 55,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium features corporate hospitality suites, medical, training, and conferencing and banqueting facilities. The consortium will operate the stadium as well as manage and maintain the defined areas of the surrounding urban park and sport precinct on the 85-hectare Greenpoint Common from stadium revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/2010/greenpoint-011208.htm|title=Greenpoint stadium operator chosen|publisher=SouthAfrica.info|date=1 December 2008|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ajax Cape Town]] have used the stadium as their home ground from the [[2010-11 Premier Soccer League]] (PSL) season onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickoff.com/news/16497/ajax-lused-cape-town-stadium.php|title=Chiefs to use Rand Stadium this season|publisher=KickOff Magazine|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the stadium's ongoing financial problems, the City of Cape Town had sought to acquire [[Western Province (rugby team)|Western Province rugby]] as an "anchor tenant". After four years of talks, Western Province announced in December 2014 that they had decided to remain at [[Newlands Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Anel|title=WP says no to Cape Town Stadium|url=http://www.iol.co.za/sport/rugby/wp-says-no-to-cape-town-stadium-1.1797241#.VcvHl_lVhHw|accessdate=12 August 2015|work=IOL Sport|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, the [[South African Rugby Union]] announced that the [[South Africa Sevens]] tournament would be staged at Cape Town Stadium for four years, beginning in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green Point becomes new Sevens heaven|url=http://www.supersport.com/rugby/sevens/news/150320/Green_Point_becomes_new_Sevens_heaven|accessdate=12 August 2015|work=SuperSport|date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, it was announced that new PSL club [[Cape Town City F.C.

==Inaugural games==

The first game to be hosted at the new Cape Town Stadium was a Cape Town derby between [[Ajax Cape Town]] and [[Engen Santos|Santos]] on 23 January 2010 as part of the official inauguration of the stadium. Only 20,000 tickets were made available for the event and were sold out by Friday 15 January 2010.

==Movies==
Cape Town Stadium was featured in the film ''[[Safe House (2012 film)|Safe House]]'' (2012). The stadium also features in many local advertising and print media campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/safe-house-how-one-film-put-cape-towns-movie-industry-on-the-map-7851268.html|title=Safe House: How one film put Cape Town's movie industry on the map|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
On 7 November 2012, shortly before the U.S rock band [[Linkin Park]] was set to perform at the sold-out stadium, gusts of wind caused advertising scaffolding outside the stadium to collapse onto a crowd of people injuring 19 and killing 1; of the 19 injured, 12 were taken to hospital for further treatment.&lt;ref name ="UltimateGuitarLinkinParkCapeTown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/one_dead_and_several_injured_at_linkin_park_show_in_cape_town.html|title=One Dead And Several Injured at Linkin Park Show in Cape Town - Music News @ Ultimate-Guitar.Com|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calls for demolition==
Several individuals and groups have called for the stadium to be demolished due to its under-utilization after the World Cup. Effective utilization and use of the stadium is thus a political issue in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/tear-down-cape-town-stadium-1327924|title=‘Tear down Cape Town Stadium’ {{!}} IOL|website=IOL|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/cape-town-stadium-icon-or-albatross-1867226|title=Cape Town Stadium: icon or albatross {{!}} IOL|website=IOL|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/opinion/why-cape-town-stadium-should-be-demolished|title=Why Cape Town stadium should be demolished - OPINION {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cricket Scotland''', formerly known as the '''Scottish Cricket Union''', is the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] of the sport of [[cricket in Scotland]]. The body is based at the National Cricket Academy, Edinburgh.

The SCU was formed in 1908, but underwent a major restructuring in 2001 including a name change. It became an [[International Cricket Council]] member in 1994 as an Associate nation. It has three sub-associations: [[East of Scotland Cricket Association]], Western District Cricket Union and the Aberdeenshire Cricket Association.

==Structure==
The governing body for cricket in Scotland is Cricket Scotland which was formed in 1908 as the Scottish Cricket Union, but re-structured in 2001. The work of Cricket Scotland includes the organisation and administration of national representative sides (senior and youth, men and women); the organisation of District/Area cricket; the organisation of national club cup competitions; the Scottish National Cricket Leagues; a national coaching programme for elite squads and at grass roots level; coach education; advice to members on relevant issues; and generally developing and promoting the game in Scotland. There are 150 cricket clubs affiliated to Cricket Scotland, but in total it is estimated that there are well over 250 clubs in Scotland.
 
Cricket Scotland employs 3 full-time and one part-time Cricket Development Officers covering the whole of Scotland. These Development officers work in association with local clubs, schools and associations in running coaching courses and coach education throughout the country, setting up leagues introducing new initiatives such as 'Inter-cricket' and '[[Kwik- Cricket]]'.
 
The Scottish season runs from mid-April to early September, with almost all senior cricket being played on grass pitches. League cricket is mainly played on Saturdays whilst Sundays sees the majority of cup competitions played. Mid-week cricket is also becoming more popular for friendly matches as the demand for pitches at weekends grows.&lt;ref&gt;

==Name change==
After the organisation was founded in 1908, it was known as the Scottish Cricket Union. This was renamed as Cricket Scotland in 2001.

== Hall of Fame ==

In November 2011, Cricket Scotland introduced to legends of Scottish cricket who played an integral part in the development of Scottish cricket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/scotland/content/story/542926.html Scottish cricket launches Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketscotland.com/corporate/scottish-cricket-hall-fame/ Cricket Scotland for inductees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketscotland.com/news/article/new-scottish-cricket-hall-fame-inductees/ NEW SCOTTISH CRICKET HALL OF FAME INDUCTEES]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] and [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] [[cricket]]er called '''Durling''' (first name, date of birth and date of death unknown) was a noted player in the mid-18th century, although nothing is known of him outside mentions in match reports.

He played for the famous [[Addington Cricket Club]] and he is first recorded in the [[1748 English cricket season|1748 season]] when he took part in a "fives" match for high stakes alongside other leading players of the day, his team winning.&lt;ref name=LL&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153251/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1746.html#durling#durling From Lads to Lord's – profile].&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier the same year, on 6 June, in another "fives" game between Addington and "The Rest of England excluding Kent", Addington’s players were [[Tom Faulkner]], [[Harris brothers (disambiguation)|Joe Harris, John Harris]], [[George Jackson (cricketer)|George Jackson]] and ''the shoemaker that lately came out of Kent''!  As Durling was himself apparently new that season, it is possible that he was the mysterious shoemaker.&lt;ref name=ASW&gt;[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], ''At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742-1751'', ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, when All-England played his native Surrey and were a man short, they picked Durling from their opponents to complete the side.&lt;ref name=ASW/&gt;  Later that year, when Addington played All-England in a "fives" match, Durling played for a very strong Addington side alongside Faulkner, Jackson and the Harris brothers.&lt;ref name=ASW/&gt;

Durling features in big matches through the 1750s, playing against [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] in 1756 and for All-England on other occasions including the games against [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] in 1759.  He is last recorded in the [[1761 English cricket season|1761 season]].&lt;ref name=LL/&gt;

The Elo system was originally invented as an improved [[chess]] rating system over the previously used [[Harkness rating system|Harkness system]], but is also used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in a number of [[video games]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enemydown.eu/news/502 |title=Enemydown uses Elo in its Counterstrike:Source Multilplayer Ladders |last=Wood |first=Ben |publisher=TWNA Group |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612234152/http://www.enemydown.eu/news/502 |archivedate=2009-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[association football]], [[American football]], [[basketball]],&lt;ref&gt;Nate Silver and Reuben Fischer-Baum, "How We Calculate NBA Elo Ratings," ''FiveThirtyEight.com,'' [http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-calculate-nba-elo-ratings/ May 21, 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Baseball]], [[table tennis]], ''[[Scrabble]]'', [[Board game|board games]] such as ''[[Diplomacy (game)]]'' and other games.

The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.

A player's Elo rating is represented by a number which increases or decreases depending on the outcome of games between rated players. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. In a series of games between a high-rated player and a low-rated player, the high-rated player is expected to score more wins. If the high-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the low-rated player. However, if the lower-rated player scores an [[Upset (competition)|upset win]], many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. Players whose ratings are too low should, in the long run, do better than the rating system predicts and thus gain rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.

==History==
Arpad Elo was a master-level chess player and an active participant in the [[United States Chess Federation]] (USCF) from its founding in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uschess.org/ratings/RedmanremembersRichard.pdf |title=Remembering Richard, Part II |last=Redman |first=Tim |publisher=United States Chess Federation }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The USCF used a numerical ratings system, devised by [[Kenneth Harkness]], to allow members to track their individual progress in terms other than tournament wins and losses. The Harkness system was reasonably fair, but in some circumstances gave rise to ratings which many observers considered inaccurate. On behalf of the USCF, Elo devised a new system with a more sound [[Statistics|statistical]] basis.

Elo's system replaced earlier systems of competitive rewards with a system based on statistical estimation. Rating systems for many sports award points in accordance with subjective evaluations of the 'greatness' of certain achievements. For example, winning an important [[golf]] tournament might be worth an arbitrarily chosen five times as many points as winning a lesser tournament.

A statistical endeavor, by contrast, uses a model that relates the game results to underlying variables representing the ability of each player.

Elo's central assumption was that the chess performance of each player in each game is a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]]. Although a player might perform significantly better or worse from one game to the next, Elo assumed that the mean value of the performances of any given player changes only slowly over time. Elo thought of a player's true skill as the mean of that player's performance random variable.

A further assumption is necessary because chess performance in the above sense is still not measurable. One cannot look at a sequence of moves and say, "That performance is 2039." Performance can only be inferred from wins, draws and losses. Therefore, if a player wins a game, they are assumed to have performed at a higher level than their opponent for that game. Conversely, if the player loses, they are assumed to have performed at a lower level. If the game is a draw, the two players are assumed to have performed at nearly the same level.

Elo did not specify exactly how close two performances ought to be to result in a draw as opposed to a win or loss. And while he thought it was likely that players might have different [[standard deviation]]s to their performances, he made a simplifying assumption to the contrary.

To simplify computation even further, Elo proposed a straightforward method of estimating the variables in his model (i.e., the true skill of each player). One could calculate relatively easily from tables how many games players would be expected to win based on comparisons of their ratings to those of their opponents. The ratings of a player who won more games than expected would be adjusted upward, while those of a player who won fewer than expected would be adjusted downward. Moreover, that adjustment was to be in linear proportion to the number of wins by which the player had exceeded or fallen short of their expected number.

From a modern perspective, Elo's simplifying assumptions are not necessary because computing power is inexpensive and widely available. Moreover, even within the simplified model, more efficient estimation techniques are well known. Several people, most notably [[Mark Glickman]], have proposed using more sophisticated statistical machinery to estimate the same variables. On the other hand, the computational simplicity of the Elo system has proven to be one of its greatest assets. With the aid of a pocket calculator, an informed chess competitor can calculate to within one point what their next officially published rating will be, which helps promote a perception that the ratings are fair.

=== Implementing Elo's scheme ===
The [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]] implemented Elo's suggestions in 1960,&lt;ref name="aboutUSCF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uschess.org/about/about.php |title=About the USCF |publisher=United States Chess Federation |accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fairer and more accurate than the [[Chess rating systems#Harkness system|Harkness rating system]]. Elo's system was adopted by the [[Fédération Internationale des Échecs|World Chess Federation]] (FIDE) in 1970. Elo described his work in some detail in the book ''The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present'', published in 1978.

Subsequent statistical tests have suggested that chess performance is almost certainly not distributed as a [[normal distribution]], as weaker players have greater winning chances than Elo's model predicts.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Therefore, the USCF and some chess sites use a formula based on the [[logistic distribution]]. Significant statistical anomalies have also been found when using the logistic distribution in chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.kaggle.com/2011/04/24/the-deloittefide-chess-competition-play-by-play/ | title = Deloitte Chess Rating Competition }}&lt;/ref&gt; FIDE continues to use the rating difference table as proposed by Elo. The table is calculated with [[expected value|expectation]] 0, and [[standard deviation]] 2000 / 7 (285.71).

The normal and logistic distribution points are, in a way, arbitrary points in a spectrum of distributions which would work well. In practice, both of these distributions work very well for a number of different games.

== Different ratings systems ==
The phrase "Elo rating" is often used to mean a player's chess rating as calculated by FIDE. However, this usage is confusing and misleading because Elo's general ideas have been adopted by many organizations, including the USCF (before FIDE), many other national chess federations, the short-lived [[Professional Chess Association]] (PCA), and online chess servers including the [[Internet Chess Club]] (ICC), [[Free Internet Chess Server]] (FICS), and [[Yahoo!]] Games. Each organization has a unique implementation, and none of them follows Elo's original suggestions precisely. It would be more accurate to refer to all of the above ratings as Elo ratings and none of them as ''the'' Elo rating.

Instead one may refer to the organization granting the rating. For example: "As of August 2002, [[Gregory Kaidanov]] had a FIDE rating of 2638 and a USCF rating of 2742." It should be noted that the Elo ratings of these various organizations are not always directly comparable. For example, someone with a FIDE rating of 2500 will generally have a USCF rating near 2600 and an ICC rating in the range of 2500 to 3100.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===FIDE ratings===
{{See also|FIDE World Rankings}}
For top players, the most important rating is their [[FIDE]] rating. {{As of|2012|07|since=y}}, FIDE updates its top players lists monthly.

The following analysis of the July 2015 FIDE rating list gives a rough impression of what a given FIDE rating means:
* 5323 players had an active rating in the range 2200 to 2299, which is usually associated with the [[Candidate Master]] title.
* 2869 players had an active rating in the range 2300 to 2399, which is usually associated with the [[FIDE Master]] title.
* 1420 players had an active rating between 2400 and 2499, most of whom had either the [[International Master]] or the [[International Grandmaster]] title.
* 542 players had an active rating between 2500 and 2599, most of whom had the [[International Grandmaster]] title.
* 187 players had an active rating between 2600 and 2699, all of whom had the [[International Grandmaster]] title.
* 37 players had an active rating between 2700 and 2799.
* 4 players had an active rating of over 2800.
&lt;!-- This is useless unless up to date and complete. Where is Kasparov?
* 6 players had up to date a rating over 2799: [[Magnus Carlsen]] 2882, [[Viswanathan Anand]] 2816, [[Veselin Topalov]] 2816, [[Hikaru Nakamura]] 2814, [[Shakhriyar Mamedyarov]] 2814, [[Vladimir Kramnik]] 2800. --&gt;
 
The highest ever FIDE rating was 2882, which [[Magnus Carlsen]] had on the May 2014 list.  A list of the highest-rated players ever is at [[Comparison of top chess players throughout history]].

Performance rating is a hypothetical rating that would result from the games of a single event only. Some chess organizations use the "algorithm of 400" to calculate performance rating. According to this algorithm, performance rating for an event is calculated in the following way:
# For each win, add your opponent's rating plus 400, 
# For each loss, add your opponent's rating minus 400, 
# And divide this sum by the number of played games.

Example: 2 Wins, 2 Losses&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--Please see Talk page for the formatting changes I made here. Thanks!--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\displaystyle{\frac{\left(w+400+x+400+y-400+z-400\right)}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\displaystyle{\frac{\left[w+x+y+z+400\left(2\right)-400\left(2\right)\right]}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;
This can be expressed by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle
\text{Performance rating} = \frac{\text{Total of opponents' ratings } + 400 \times (\text{Wins} - \text{Losses})}{\text{Games}}&lt;/math&gt;
Example: If you beat a player with an Elo rating of 1000,
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle
\displaystyle
\text{Performance rating} = \frac{1000 + 400 \times (1)}{1} = 1400&lt;/math&gt;
If you beat two players with Elo ratings of 1000,
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle
\displaystyle
\text{Performance rating} = \frac{2000 + 400 \times (2)}{2} = 1400&lt;/math&gt;
If you draw,
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle
\displaystyle
\text{Performance rating} = \frac{1000 + 400 \times (0)}{1} = 1000&lt;/math&gt;

This is a simplification, but it offers an easy way to get an estimate of PR (performance rating).

[[FIDE]], however, calculates performance rating by means of the formula: Opponents' Rating Average + Rating Difference. Rating Difference &lt;math&gt;d_p&lt;/math&gt; is based on a player's tournament percentage score &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, which is then used as the key in a lookup table where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is simply the number of points scored divided by the number of games played. Note that, in case of a perfect or no score &lt;math&gt;d_p&lt;/math&gt; is 800. The full table can be found in the [https://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=174&amp;view=article FIDE handbook, B. Permanent Commissions 1.0. Requirements for the titles designated in 0.31, 1.48 ] online. A simplified version of this table is on the right.

[[FIDE]] classifies tournaments into categories according to the average rating of the players. Each category is 25 rating points wide. Category 1 is for an average rating of 2251 to 2275, category 2 is 2276 to 2300, etc. For women's tournaments, the categories are 200 rating points lower, so a Category 1 is an average rating of 2051 to 2075, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=57&amp;view=article FIDE Handbook, Section B.0.0], [[FIDE]] web site&lt;/ref&gt; The highest-rated tournament has been category 23, with an average from 2801 to 2825.&lt;!-- (Zurich Chess Challenge 2014) --&gt; The top categories are in the table.

===Live ratings===
[[FIDE]] updates its ratings list at the beginning of each month. In contrast, the unofficial "Live ratings" calculate the change in players' ratings after every game. These Live ratings are based on the previously published FIDE ratings, so a player's Live rating is intended to correspond to what the FIDE rating would be if FIDE were to issue a new list that day.

Although Live ratings are unofficial, interest arose in Live ratings in August/September 2008 when five different players took the "Live" No. 1 ranking.&lt;ref&gt;Anand lost No. 1 to Morozevich ([http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=4860 Chessbase, August 24 2008]), then regained it, then Carlsen took No. 1 ([http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=4892 Chessbase, September 5 2008]), then Ivanchuk ([http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=4901 Chessbase, September 11 2008]), and finally Topalov ([http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=4908 Chessbase, September 13 2008])&lt;/ref&gt;

The unofficial live ratings of players over 2700 were published and maintained by Hans Arild Runde at [https://web.archive.org/web/20080603001814/http://chess.liverating.org/ the Live Rating website] until August 2011. Another website [http://www.2700chess.com www.2700chess.com] has been maintained since May 2011 by Artiom Tsepotan, which covers the top 100 players as well as the top 50 female players.

Rating changes can be calculated manually by using the FIDE ratings change calculator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ratings.fide.com/calculator_rtd.phtml|title=FIDE Chess Rating calculators: Chess Rating change calculator|first=|last=Administrator|website=ratings.fide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; All top players have a K-factor of 10, which means that the maximum ratings change from a single game is a little less than 10 points.

Currently (February 2018), the No. 1 spot in both the official FIDE rating list and the live rating list is taken by [[Magnus Carlsen]].

=== United States Chess Federation ratings ===
The [[United States Chess Federation]] (USCF) uses its own classification of players:&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.uschess.org/ratings/ratedist.php US Chess Federation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618103954/http://archive.uschess.org/ratings/ratedist.php |date=2012-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2400 and above: Senior Master
*2200–2399: National Master
**2200–2399 plus 300 games above 2200: Original &lt;!--The title has been changed, though I am too lazy to find a source--&gt; Life Master&lt;ref&gt;[http://main.uschess.org/content/view/7327#Master USCF Glossary Quote:"a player who competes in over 300 games with a rating over 2200"] from The United States Chess Federation&lt;/ref&gt;
*2000–2199: Expert
*1800–1999: Class A
*1600–1799: Class B
*1400–1599: Class C
*1200–1399: Class D
*1000–1199: Class E
*800–999: Class F
*600–799: Class G
*400–599: Class H
*200–399: Class I
*0–199: Class J

In general, a beginner is around 800, a mid-level player is around 1600, and a professional, around 2400.

====The K-factor used by the USCF====
The ''K-factor'', in the USCF rating system, can be estimated by dividing 800 by the effective number of games a player's rating is based on (''N&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'') plus the number of games the player completed in a tournament ('''m''').&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.bu.edu/people/mg/ratings/approx/approx.html "Approximating Formulas for the USCF Rating System"], [[United States Chess Federation]], Mark Glickman, Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Boston University, 22 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;K = 800 / (N_e + m)\, &lt;/math&gt;

====Rating floors====
The USCF maintains an absolute rating floor of 100 for all ratings. Thus, no member can have a rating below 100, no matter their performance at USCF-sanctioned events. However, players can have higher individual absolute rating floors, calculated using the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;AF = \operatorname{min}\{100+4N_W+2N_D+N_R , 150\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_W&lt;/math&gt; is the number of rated games won, &lt;math&gt;N_D&lt;/math&gt; is the number of rated games drawn, and &lt;math&gt;N_R&lt;/math&gt; is the number of events in which the player completed three or more rated games.

Higher rating floors exist for experienced players who have achieved significant ratings. Such higher rating floors exist, starting at ratings of 1200 in 100-point increments up to 2100 (1200, 1300, 1400, ..., 2100). A rating floor is calculated by taking the player's peak established rating, subtracting 200 points, and then rounding down to the nearest rating floor. For example, a player who has reached a peak rating of 1464 would have a rating floor of 1464 − 200 = 1264, which would be rounded down to 1200. Under this scheme, only Class C players and above are capable of having a higher rating floor than their absolute player rating. All other players would have a floor of at most 150.

There are two ways to achieve higher rating floors other than under the standard scheme presented above. If a player has achieved the rating of Original Life Master, their rating floor is set at 2200. The achievement of this title is unique in that no other recognized USCF title will result in a new floor. For players with ratings below 2000, winning a cash prize of $2,000 or more raises that player's rating floor to the closest 100-point level that would have disqualified the player for participation in the tournament. For example, if a player won $4,000 in a 1750-and-under tournament, they would now have a rating floor of 1800.

==Theory==
[[Pairwise comparison]]s form the basis of the Elo rating methodology.&lt;ref name="AEE1978" /&gt; Elo made references to the papers of Good,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Good|first1=I.J.|title=On the Marking of Chessplayers|journal=The Mathematical Gazette|date=1955|volume=39|issue=330|pages=292–296|doi=10.2307/3608567|jstor=3608567}}&lt;/ref&gt; David,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David|first1=H.A.|title=Tournaments and Paired Comparisons|journal=Biometrics|date=1959|volume=46|issue=1-2|pages=139–149|doi=10.1093/biomet/46.1-2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trawinski and David,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trawinski|first1=B.J.|last2=David|first2=H.A.|title=Selection of the Best Treatment in a Paired-Comparison Experiment|journal=Annals of Mathematical Statistics|date=1963|volume=34|issue=1|pages=75–91|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177704243|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177704243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Buhlman and Huber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buhlmann|first1=Hans|last2=Huber|first2=Peter J.|title=Pairwise Comparison and Ranking in Tournaments|date=1963|volume=34|issue=2|pages=501–510|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177704161|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177704161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical details ===
Performance is not measured absolutely; it is inferred from wins, losses, and draws against other players. Players' ratings depend on the ratings of their opponents and the results scored against them. The difference in rating between two players determines an estimate for the expected score between them. Both the average and the spread of ratings can be arbitrarily chosen. Elo suggested scaling ratings so that a difference of 200 rating points in chess would mean that the stronger player has an ''expected score'' (which basically is an expected average score) of approximately 0.75, and the USCF initially aimed for an average club player to have a rating of 1500.

A player's ''expected score'' is their probability of winning plus half their probability of drawing. Thus, an expected score of 0.75 could represent a 75% chance of winning, 25% chance of losing, and 0% chance of drawing. On the other extreme it could represent a 50% chance of winning, 0% chance of losing, and 50% chance of drawing. The probability of drawing, as opposed to having a decisive result, is not specified in the Elo system. Instead, a draw is considered half a win and half a loss.

If Player A has a rating of &lt;math&gt;R_A&lt;/math&gt; and Player B a rating of &lt;math&gt;R_B&lt;/math&gt;, the exact formula (using the [[logistic curve]])&lt;ref name="AEE1978"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Rating of Chessplayers, Past&amp;Present | last = Elo|first = Arpad E |publisher = ISHI Press International|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-923891-27-5|location = Bronx NY 10453 |pages = |chapter = 8.4 Logistic Probability as a Rating Basis | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the expected score of Player A is

:&lt;math&gt;E_A = \frac 1 {1 + 10^{(R_B - R_A)/400}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly the expected score for Player B is

:&lt;math&gt;E_B = \frac 1 {1 + 10^{(R_A - R_B)/400}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This could also be expressed by

:&lt;math&gt;E_A = \frac{Q_A}{Q_A + Q_B}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;E_B = \frac{Q_B}{Q_A + Q_B},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Q_A = 10^{R_A/400}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_B = 10^{R_B/400}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that in the latter case, the same denominator applies to both expressions. This means that by studying only the numerators, we find out that the expected score for player A is &lt;math&gt;Q_A/Q_B&lt;/math&gt; times greater than the expected score for player B. It then follows that for each 400 rating points of advantage over the opponent, the expected score is magnified ten times in comparison to the opponent's expected score.

Also note that &lt;math&gt;E_A + E_B = 1&lt;/math&gt;. In practice, since the true strength of each player is unknown, the expected scores are calculated using the player's current ratings.

When a player's actual tournament scores exceed their expected scores, the Elo system takes this as evidence that player's rating is too low, and needs to be adjusted upward. Similarly, when a player's actual tournament scores fall short of their expected scores, that player's rating is adjusted downward. Elo's original suggestion, which is still widely used, was a simple linear adjustment proportional to the amount by which a player overperformed or underperformed their expected score. The maximum possible adjustment per game, called the K-factor, was set at ''K'' = 16 for masters and ''K'' = 32 for weaker players.

Supposing Player A was expected to score &lt;math&gt;E_A&lt;/math&gt; points but actually scored &lt;math&gt;S_A&lt;/math&gt; points. The formula for updating that player's rating is

:&lt;math&gt;R_A^\prime = R_A + K(S_A - E_A).&lt;/math&gt;

This update can be performed after each game or each tournament, or after any suitable rating period. An example may help clarify. Suppose Player A has a rating of 1613 and plays in a five-round tournament. He loses to a player rated 1609, draws with a player rated 1477, defeats a player rated 1388, defeats a player rated 1586, and loses to a player rated 1720. The player's actual score is (0 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 0) = 2.5. The expected score, calculated according to the formula above, was (0.51 + 0.69 + 0.79 + 0.54 + 0.35) = 2.88. Therefore, the player's new rating is (1613 + 32(2.5 − 2.88)) = 1601, assuming that a K-factor of 32 is used.  Equivalently, each game the player can be said to have put an ante of K times their score for the game into a pot, the opposing player does likewise, and the winner collects the full pot of value K; in the event of a draw, the players split the pot and receive K/2 points each.

Note that while two wins, two losses, and one draw may seem like a par score, it is worse than expected for Player A because their opponents were lower rated on average. Therefore, Player A is slightly penalized. If Player A had scored two wins, one loss, and two draws, for a total score of three points, that would have been slightly better than expected, and the player's new rating would have been (1613 + 32(3 − 2.88)) = 1617.

This updating procedure is at the core of the ratings used by [[FIDE]], [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]], [[Yahoo! Games]], the [[Internet Chess Club]] (ICC) and the [[Free Internet Chess Server]] (FICS). However, each organization has taken a different route to deal with the uncertainty inherent in the ratings, particularly the ratings of newcomers, and to deal with the problem of ratings inflation/deflation. New players are assigned provisional ratings, which are adjusted more drastically than established ratings.

The principles used in these rating systems can be used for rating other competitions—for instance, international [[association football|football]] matches.

Elo ratings have also been applied to games without the possibility of [[Draw (chess)|draw]]s, and to games in which the result can also have a quantity (small/big margin) in addition to the quality (win/loss). See [[Go ranks and ratings#Elo-like rating systems as used in Go|Go rating with Elo]] for more.

=== Mathematical issues ===
There are three main mathematical concerns relating to the original work of Elo, namely the correct curve, the correct K-factor, and the provisional period crude calculations.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== Most accurate distribution model ====
The first mathematical concern addressed by the USCF was the use of the [[normal distribution]]. They found that this did not accurately represent the actual results achieved, particularly by the lower rated players. Instead they switched to a [[logistic distribution]] model, which the USCF found provided a better fit for the actual results achieved. FIDE also uses an approximation to the logistic distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=197&amp;view=article |title=FIDE Rating Regulations effective from 1 July 2017 |publisher=FIDE |accessdate=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Most accurate K-factor ====
The second major concern is the correct "K-factor" used. The chess statistician [[Jeff Sonas]] believes that the original K=10 value (for players rated above 2400) is inaccurate in Elo's work. If the K-factor coefficient is set too large, there will be too much sensitivity to just a few, recent events, in terms of a large number of points exchanged in each game. Too low a K-value, and the sensitivity will be minimal, and the system will not respond quickly enough to changes in a player's actual level of performance.

Elo's original K-factor estimation was made without the benefit of huge databases and statistical evidence. Sonas indicates that a K-factor of 24 (for players rated above 2400) may be more accurate both as a predictive tool of future performance, and also more sensitive to performance.&lt;ref&gt;A key Sonas article is [http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=562 Jeff Sonas: ''The Sonas Rating Formula — Better than Elo?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain Internet chess sites seem to avoid a three-level K-factor staggering based on rating range. For example, the ICC seems to adopt a global K=32 except when playing against provisionally rated players. The USCF (which makes use of a [[logistic distribution]] as opposed to a [[normal distribution]]) has staggered the K-factor according to three main rating ranges of:

* Players below 2100: K-factor of 32 used
* Players between 2100 and 2400: K-factor of 24 used
* Players above 2400: K-factor of 16 used.

FIDE uses the following ranges:&lt;ref name="FideRules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=172&amp;view=article |title=FIDE Online. FIDE Rating Regulations effective from 1 July 2014 |publisher=Fide.com |date=2014-07-01 |accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* K = 40, for a player new to the rating list until the completion of events with a total of 30 games and for all players until their 18th birthday, as long as their rating remains under 2300.
* K = 20, for players with a rating always under 2400.
* K = 10, for players with any published rating of at least 2400 and at least 30 games played in previous events. Thereafter it remains permanently at 10.

FIDE used the following ranges before July 2014:&lt;ref name="FideRulesOld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=161&amp;view=article |title=FIDE Online. FIDE Rating Regulations valid from 1 July 2013 till 1 July 2014 |publisher=Fide.com |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* K = 30 (was 25), for a player new to the rating list until the completion of events with a total of 30 games.&lt;ref name="Changes to FIDE Rating Regulations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/5421-changes-to-rating-regulations.html |title=FIDE Online. Changes to Rating Regulations news release |publisher=Fide.com |date=2011-07-21 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* K = 15, for players with a rating always under 2400.
* K = 10, for players with any published rating of at least 2400 and at least 30 games played in previous events. Thereafter it remains permanently at 10.

&lt;!-- I find the remainder of this section incomprehensible. Help!! --~~~~ --&gt;
&lt;!-- I think -- but am not certain -- that it is saying a high K-factor helps high rated players exploit other flaws in the rating system in situations where they can choose their opponents. --&gt;
The gradation of the K-factor reduces ratings changes at the top end of the rating spectrum, reducing the possibility for rapid ratings inflation or deflation for those with a low K factor. This might in theory apply equally to an online chess site or over-the-board players, since it is more difficult for players to get much higher ratings when their K-factor is reduced. When playing online, it may simply be the selection of highly rated opponents that enables 2800+ players to further increase their rating,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessclub.com/help/k-factor |title=ICC Help: k-factor |publisher=Chessclub.com |date=2002-10-18 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; since a grandmaster on the ICC playing site can play a string of different opponents who are all rated over 2100. In over-the-board events, it would only be in very high level all-play-all events that a player would be able to engage that number of 2700+ opponents, while in a normal open Swiss-paired chess tournament, frequently there would be many opponents rated less than 2500, reducing the ratings gains possible from a single contest.

== Practical issues ==

=== Game activity versus protecting one's rating ===
In some cases the rating system can discourage game activity for players who wish to protect their rating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles176.pdf A Parent's Guide to Chess] ''Skittles'', Don Heisman, Chesscafe.com, August 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In order to discourage players from sitting on a high rating, a 2012 proposal by British Grandmaster [[John Nunn]] for choosing qualifiers to the chess world championship included an activity bonus, to be combined with the rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2440 |title=Chess News - The Nunn Plan for the World Chess Championship |publisher=ChessBase.com |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the chess world, concerns over players avoiding competitive play to protect their ratings caused [[Wizards of the Coast]] to abandon the Elo system for ''[[Magic: the Gathering]]'' tournaments in favour of a system of their own devising called "Planeswalker Points".&lt;ref name=Planeswalkerpointsarticle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/159b|title=Introducing Planeswalker Points|date=September 6, 2011|accessdate=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=planeswalkerpointsarticle2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/week-was/getting-points-aaron-and-scott-2011-09-09|title=Getting to the Points|date=September 9, 2011|accessdate=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some videogames that utilize the Elo system&amp;mdash;''[[League of Legends]]'', for example&amp;mdash;enforce players to keep up their activity by having their rating decay if a certain quota of activity is not fulfilled.&lt;ref name=leagueoflegendselo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ|title=League of Legends Ranked Play FAQ|date=January 30, 2018|accessdate=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selective pairing ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
A more subtle issue is related to pairing. When players can choose their own opponents, they can choose opponents with minimal risk of losing, and maximum reward for winning.  Particular examples of players rated 2800+ choosing opponents with minimal risk and maximum possibility of rating gain include: choosing computers that they know they can beat with a certain strategy; choosing opponents that they think are overrated; or avoiding playing strong players who are rated several hundred points below them, but may hold chess titles such as IM or GM. In the category of choosing overrated opponents, new entrants to the rating system who have played fewer than 50 games are in theory a convenient target as they may be overrated in their provisional rating. The ICC compensates for this issue by assigning a lower K-factor to the established player if they do win against a new rating entrant. The K-factor is actually a function of the number of rated games played by the new entrant.

Therefore, Elo ratings online still provide a useful mechanism for providing a rating based on the opponent's rating. Its overall credibility, however, needs to be seen in the context of at least the above two major issues described &amp;mdash; engine abuse, and selective pairing of opponents.

The ICC has also recently introduced "auto-pairing" ratings which are based on random pairings, but with each win in a row ensuring a statistically much harder opponent who has also won x games in a row. With potentially hundreds of players involved, this creates some of the challenges of a major large Swiss event which is being fiercely contested, with round winners meeting round winners. This approach to pairing certainly maximizes the rating risk of the higher-rated participants, who may face very stiff opposition from players below 3000, for example. This is a separate rating in itself, and is under "1-minute" and "5-minute" rating categories. Maximum ratings achieved over 2500 are exceptionally rare.

=== Ratings inflation and deflation ===
[[File:Elo rating graph.svg|thumb|300px|Graphs of probabilities and Elo rating changes (for K=16 and 32) of expected outcome (solid curve) and unexpected outcome (dotted curve) vs initial rating difference.

For example, player A starts with a 1400 rating and B with 1800 in a tournament using K = 32 (brown curves). The blue dash-dot line denotes the initial rating difference of 400 (1800 - 1400). The probability of B winning, the expected outcome, is 0.91 (intersection of black solid curve and blue line); if this happens, A's rating decreases by 3 (intersection of brown solid curve and blue line) to 1397 and B's increases by the same amount to 1803. Conversely, the probability of A winning, the unexpected outcome, is 0.09 (intersection of black dotted curve and blue line); if this happens, A's rating increases by 29 (intersection of brown dotted curve and blue line) to 1429 and B's decreases by the same amount to 1771.]]

An increase or decrease in the average rating over all players in the rating system is often referred to as ''rating inflation'' or ''rating deflation'' respectively. For example, if there is inflation, a modern rating of 2500 means less than a historical rating of 2500, while the reverse is true if there is deflation. Using ratings to compare players between different eras is made more difficult when inflation or deflation are present. (See also [[Comparison of top chess players throughout history]].)

It is commonly believed that, at least at the top level, modern ratings are inflated. For instance [[Nigel Short]] said in September 2009, "The recent ChessBase article on rating inflation by Jeff Sonas would suggest that my rating in the late 1980s would be approximately equivalent to 2750 in today's much debauched currency".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5736 Nigel Short on being number one in Britain again], [[Chessbase]], 4 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (Short's highest rating in the 1980s was 2665 in July 1988, which was equal to third in the world. When he made this comment, 2665 would have ranked him 65th, while 2750 would have ranked him equal 10th. In the September 2012 FIDE rating list, 2665 would have ranked him equal 86th, while 2750 would have ranked him 13th.)

It has been suggested that an overall increase in ratings reflects greater skill. The advent of strong chess computers allows a somewhat objective evaluation of the absolute playing skill of past chess masters, based on their recorded games, but this is also a measure of how computerlike the players' moves are, not merely a measure of how strongly they have played.&lt;ref name="inflation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5608|title=Rating Inflation - Its Causes and Possible Cures|last=Sonas|first=Jeff|date=July 27, 2009|publisher=[[ChessBase]]|accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of people with ratings over 2700 has increased. Around 1979 there was only one active player ([[Anatoly Karpov]]) with a rating this high. In 1992 [[Viswanathan Anand]] was only the 8th player in chess history to reach the 2700 mark at that point of time.&lt;ref name="Viswanathan Anand"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessplayer?pid=12088 |title=Viswanathan Anand |publisher=Chessgames.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased to 15 players by 1994. 33 players had a 2700+ rating in 2009 and 44 as of September 2012. The current benchmark for elite players lies beyond 2800.

One possible cause for this inflation was the rating floor, which for a long time was at 2200, and if a player dropped below this they were stricken from the rating list. As a consequence, players at a skill level just below the floor would only be on the rating list if they were overrated, and this would cause them to feed points into the rating pool.&lt;ref name="inflation"/&gt; In July 2000 the average rating of the top 100 was 2644. By July 2012 it had increased to 2703.&lt;ref name="Viswanathan Anand"/&gt;

In a pure Elo system, each game ends in an equal transaction of rating points. If the winner gains N rating points, the loser will drop by N rating points. This prevents points from entering or leaving the system when games are played and rated. However, players tend to enter the system as novices with a low rating and retire from the system as experienced players with a high rating. Therefore, in the long run a system with strictly equal transactions tends to result in rating deflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjakk.no/nsf/elosystem_main.html |title=ELO-SYSTEMET |last=Bergersen |first=Per A |publisher=Norwegian Chess Federation |language=Norwegian |accessdate=21 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130308184326/http://www.sjakk.no/nsf/elosystem_main.html |archivedate=8 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the USCF acknowledged that several young scholastic players were improving faster than what the rating system was able to track. As a result, established players with stable ratings started to lose rating points to the young and underrated players. Several of the older established players were frustrated over what they considered an unfair rating decline, and some even quit chess over it.&lt;ref name="glickman"&gt;A conversation with Mark Glickman [http://www.glicko.net/ratings/cl-article.pdf], Published in ''Chess Life'' October 2006 issue&lt;/ref&gt;

====Combatting deflation====
Because of the significant difference in timing of when inflation and deflation occur, and in order to combat deflation, most implementations of Elo ratings have a mechanism for injecting points into the system in order to maintain relative ratings over time. FIDE has two inflationary mechanisms. First, performances below a "ratings floor" are not tracked, so a player with true skill below the floor can only be unrated or overrated, never correctly rated. Second, established and higher-rated players have a lower K-factor. New players have a K=40, which drops to K=20 after 30 played games, and to K=10 when the player reaches 2400.&lt;ref name="FideRules"/&gt;
The current system in the United States includes a bonus point scheme which feeds rating points into the system in order to track improving players, and different K-values for different players.&lt;ref name="glickman"/&gt; Some methods, used in Norway for example, differentiate between juniors and seniors, and use a larger K factor for the young players, even boosting the rating progress by 100% for when they score well above their predicted performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjakk.no/nsf/elosystem_index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130308184308/http://www.sjakk.no/nsf/elosystem_index.html |archivedate=March 8, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rating floors in the United States work by guaranteeing that a player will never drop below a certain limit. This also combats deflation, but the chairman of the USCF Ratings Committee has been critical of this method because it does not feed the extra points to the improving players. A possible motive for these rating floors is to combat sandbagging, i.e., deliberate lowering of ratings to be eligible for lower rating class sections and prizes.&lt;ref name="glickman"/&gt;

===Ratings of computers===
Since 2005–06, [[human-computer chess matches]] have demonstrated that [[chess computers]] are capable of defeating even the strongest human players ([[Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov]]). However, ratings of computers are difficult to quantify. There have been too few games under tournament conditions to give computers or software engines an accurate rating.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see the comments at [http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2476 ChessBase.com - Chess News - Adams vs Hydra: Man 0.5 – Machine 5.5&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, for [[chess engine]]s, the rating is dependent on the machine that the program runs on.

For some ratings estimates, see [[Chess engine rating lists|Chess engine § Ratings]].

== Use outside of chess ==

The Elo rating system is used in the chess portion of [[chess boxing]]. In order to be eligible for professional chess boxing, one must have an Elo rating of at least 1600, as well as competing in 50 or more matches of amateur boxing or martial arts.

[[College football|American college football]] used the Elo method as a portion of its [[Bowl Championship Series]] rating systems from [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998]] to [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013]] after which the BCS was replaced by the [[College Football Playoff]]. [[Jeff Sagarin]] of ''[[USA Today]]'' publishes team rankings for most American sports, which includes Elo system ratings for college football. The use of rating systems was effectively scrapped with the creation of the College Football Playoff in 2014; participants in the CFP and its associated bowl games are chosen by a selection committee.

National [[Scrabble]] organizations compute normally distributed Elo ratings except in the [[United Kingdom]], where a different system is used. The [[North American Scrabble Players Association]] has the largest rated population of active members, numbering about 2,000 as of early 2011. [[Lexulous]] also uses the Elo system.

The popular [[First Internet Backgammon Server]] (FIBS) calculates ratings based on a modified Elo system. New players are assigned a rating of 1500, with the best humans and bots rating over 2000. The same formula has been adopted by several other backgammon sites, such as [[Play65]], [[DailyGammon]], [[GoldToken]] and [[VogClub]]. VogClub sets a new player's rating at 1600. The UK Backgammon Federation uses the FIBS formula for its UK national ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://results.ukbgf.com|title=Backgammon Ratings - UKBGF|website=results.ukbgf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Go Federation]] adopted an Elo-based rating system initially pioneered by the Czech Go Federation.

In other sports, individuals maintain rankings based on the Elo algorithm. These are usually unofficial, not endorsed by the sport's governing body. The [[World Football Elo Ratings]] rank national teams in men's [[association football|football]]. In 2006, Elo ratings were adapted for [[Major League Baseball]] teams by [[Nate Silver]], then of [[Baseball Prospectus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nate Silver]], "We Are Elo?" June 28, 2006.[http://baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=5247] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822122806/http://baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=5247 |date=2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this adaptation, both also makes Elo-based [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulations of the odds of whether teams will make the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/statistics/ps_oddselo.php |title=Postseason Odds, ELO version |publisher=Baseballprospectus.com |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Beyond the Box Score, an [[SB Nation]] site, introduced an Elo ranking system for international baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cole|first1=Bryan|title=Elo rankings for international baseball|url=http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2014/8/15/5989787/elo-rankings-for-international-baseball|accessdate=4 November 2015|work=Beyond the Box Score|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|date=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In tennis, the Elo-based Universal Tennis Rating (UTR) rates players on a global scale, regardless of age, gender, or nationality. It is the official rating system of major organizations such as the [[Intercollegiate Tennis Association]] and [[World TeamTennis]] and is frequently used in segments on the [[Tennis Channel]]. The algorithm analyzes more than 8 million match results from over 800,000 tennis players worldwide. On May 8, 2018, [[Rafael Nadal]] - having won 46 consecutive sets in clay court matches - had a near-perfect clay UTR of 16.42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.universaltennis.com/2018/05/08/is-rafa-the-goat-of-clay/|title=Is Rafa the GOAT of Clay?|date=8 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the few Elo-based rankings endorsed by a sport's governing body is the [[FIFA Women's World Rankings]], based on a simplified version of the Elo algorithm, which [[FIFA]] uses as its official ranking system for national teams in [[women's association football|women's football]].

From the first ranking list after the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], FIFA is also planning to use Elo for [[FIFA World Rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141237/https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/revision-of-the-fifa-coca-cola-world-ranking.pdf?cloudid=jgxjkdrj1jfwyunjbkha]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Nate Silver, editor-in-chief of the statistical commentary website [[FiveThirtyEight]], and Reuben Fischer-Baum produced Elo ratings for every [[National Basketball Association]] team and season through the 2014 season.&lt;ref&gt;"How We Calculate NBA Elo Ratings," ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', May 21, 2015.[http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-calculate-nba-elo-ratings/].

Leagues and match-makers for the skill-based game [[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]] use Elo ratings such as [[ESEA League]] and [[Faceit]]; however, the game's own matchmaking system uses [[Glicko-2]].

Various online games use Elo ratings for player-versus-player rankings. Since 2005, ''[[Golden Tee Golf|Golden Tee Live]]'' has rated players based on the Elo system.

''[[Roblox]]'' introduced the Elo rating in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.roblox.com/?p=2032|title=ROBLOX Contests|date=February 9, 2010|accessdate=9 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212133335/http://blog.roblox.com/?p=2032|archivedate=12 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The browser game ''[[Quidditch Manager]]'' uses the Elo rating to measure a team's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.quidditch-manager.com/help.php |title=Quidditch Manager - Help and Rules |publisher=Quidditch-Manager.com |date=2012-08-25 |accessdate=2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent game to start using the Elo rating system is ''[[AirMech]]'', using Elo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carbongames.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=83043#p83043|title=AirMech developer explains why they use Elo|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ratings for 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 random/team matchmaking. ''RuneScape 3'' was to use the Elo system for the rerelease of bounty hunter in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://services.runescape.com/m=news/design-doc--bounty-hunter--deathmatch-pvp?acq_id=3001 {{Dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mechwarrior Online]]'' instituted an Elo system for its new "Comp Queue" mode, effective with the Jun 20, 2017 patch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mwomercs.com/news/2017/06/1839-patch-notes-14120-20jun2017|title=MWO: News|website=mwomercs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClanBase |title=Earliest known launch date of Clanbase.com |accessdate=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}} an online gaming ladder called Clanbase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clanbase.com |title=Weyback Machine record of Clanbase.com |accessdate=2017-10-29}}{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/clanbase.com |date=* }}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched, who used the Elo scoring system to rank teams. The site later went offline in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clanbase.org/ |title=Clanbase farewell message |accessdate=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar alternative site was launched in 2016 under the name Scrimbase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scrimbase.com/about |title=Scrimbase Gaming Ladder |accessdate=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are also using the Elo scoring system for ranking teams.

Despite questions of the appropriateness of using the Elo system to rate games in which luck is a factor, trading-card game manufacturers often use Elo ratings for their organized play efforts. The [[Duelists' Convocation International|DCI]] (formerly Duelists' Convocation International) used Elo ratings for tournaments of ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' and other [[Wizards of the Coast]] games. However, the DCI abandoned this system in 2012 in favour of a new cumulative system of "Planeswalker Points", chiefly because of the above-noted concern that Elo encourages highly rated players to avoid playing to "protect their rating".&lt;ref name="Planeswalkerpointsarticle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="planeswalkerpointsarticle2" /&gt; [[Pokémon USA]] uses the Elo system to rank its TCG organized play competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/about/tournaments-glossary/#elo|title=Play! Pokémon Glossary: Elo|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prizes for the top players in various regions included holidays and world championships invites until the 2011–2012 season, where awards were based on a system of Championship Points, their rationale being the same as the DCI's for ''Magic: The Gathering''. Similarly, [[Decipher, Inc.]] used the Elo system for its ranked games such as ''[[Star Trek Customizable Card Game]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Customizable Card Game]]''.

Moreover, [[online judge]] sites are also using Elo rating system or its derivatives. For example, [[Topcoder]] is using a modified version based on normal distribution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.topcoder.com/wiki/display/tc/Algorithm+Competition+Rating+System|title=Algorithm Competition Rating System|date=December 23, 2009|accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Codeforces is using another version based on logistic distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codeforces.com/help|title=FAQ: What are the rating and the divisions?|accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codeforces.com/blog/entry/870|title=Rating Distribution|accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codeforces.com/blog/entry/893|title=Regarding rating: Part 2|accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other usage===
The Elo rating system has been used in [[soft biometrics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/272922/1/IJCB%20(3).pdf "Using Comparative Human Descriptions for Soft Biometrics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308190221/http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/272922/1/IJCB%20%283%29.pdf |date=2013-03-08 }}, D.A. Reid and M.S. Nixon, International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB), 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which concerns the identification of individuals using human descriptions. Comparative descriptions were utilized alongside the Elo rating system to provide robust and discriminative 'relative measurements', permitting accurate identification.

The Elo rating system has also been used in biology for assessing male dominance hierarchies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pörschmann|journal=Molecular Ecology|year=2010|volume=19|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04665.x/abstract|title=Male reproductive success and its behavioural correlates in a polygynous mammal, the Galápagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki)|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04665.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in automation and computer vision for fabric inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsang|journal=Pattern Recognition|year=2016|volume=51|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320315003532/abstract|title=Fabric inspection based on the Elo rating method|doi=10.1016/j.patcog.2015.09.022|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in the media==
The Elo rating system was featured prominently in ''[[The Social Network]]'' during the algorithm scene where [[Mark Zuckerberg]] released [[Facemash]]. In the scene [[Eduardo Saverin]] writes mathematical formulas for the Elo rating system on Zuckerberg's dormitory room window. Behind the scenes, the movie claims, the Elo system is employed to rank girls by their attractiveness. The equations driving the algorithm are shown briefly, written on the window;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flash.sonypictures.com/video/movies/thesocialnetwork/awards/thesocialnetwork_screenplay.pdf Screenplay for ''The Social Network'', Sony Pictures], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; however, they are slightly incorrect.

The [[International Skating Union]] has organised the '''[[European Speed Skating Championships]] for Women''' since 1970, but they were discontinued after the 1974 tournament because of lack of interest. The European Championships for Women were reinstated in 1981.

==History==
===Distances used===
* In the years 1970–1982, four distances had to be skated: 500&amp;nbsp;m &amp;ndash; 1,000&amp;nbsp;m &amp;ndash; 1,500&amp;nbsp;m &amp;ndash; 3,000&amp;nbsp;m (the ''[[Samalog|mini combination]]'').
* From 1983–2017, four distances had to be skated: 500&amp;nbsp;m &amp;ndash; 1,500&amp;nbsp;m &amp;ndash; 3,000&amp;nbsp;m &amp;ndash; 5,000&amp;nbsp;m (the ''[[Samalog|small combination]]'').
* Starting in 2017, in odd years, a separate competition with four distances is held: 500&amp;nbsp;m – 1000&amp;nbsp;m – 500&amp;nbsp;m – 1000&amp;nbsp;m (the ''[[Samalog|sprint combination]]'').
* Starting in 2018, in even years, a single distance championships with seven events will be held: 500&amp;nbsp;m, 1000&amp;nbsp;m, 1500&amp;nbsp;m, 3000&amp;nbsp;m, team pursuit, mass start, and team sprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EK sprint en EK afstanden toegevoegd aan schaatskalender |language=Dutch |url=https://www.nu.nl/sport/4274880/ek-sprint-en-ek-afstanden-toegevoegd-schaatskalender.html | website=[[NU.nl]] |date=June 8, 2016 |accessdate=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ranking systems used===

It is one of the largest stadiums in Northern Ireland with a ticketed capacity of approximately 18,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/northern_ireland/gaelic_games/7989224.stm | work=BBC News | title=Clones to stage Tyrone-Armagh tie | date=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the home of [[Omagh St. Enda's]] and the [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] [[Gaelic football]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stadiumdb.com/healy-park-stadium-omagh-in-northern-ireland.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707034438/http://www.stadiumdb.com/healy-park-stadium-omagh-in-northern-ireland.htm |archivedate=2009-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on the Gortin Road and is approximately a 10-minute walk from the town centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omaghstendas.com/ocms/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=116 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315055259/http://www.omaghstendas.com/ocms/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=116 |archivedate=2010-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hogan Stand]] magazine said the stadium "is now recognised as one of the premier GAA venues in the country."&lt;ref name="HoganStand"&gt;[http://www.hoganstand.com/Tyrone/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=70525 Hoganstand.com - GAA Football &amp; Hurling&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In early 1962, [[Omagh St. Enda's]] club purchased {{convert|13|acre|ha}} of land at Lisnelly located near the Gortin Road. By 1968 the club had raised enough money to start construction of the new stadium. The park was eventually opened on 17 September 1972, by former GAA president Alf Murray and on 19 October 1980, the new park was dedicated to [[Michael Healy (Gaelic football)|Michael Healy]]. The two years between 1980 and 1982 saw the fruitation of the new clubrooms and social centre at Healy Park, which added further to the infrastructure of Healy Park. 1994 saw the terracing added to three sides of the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Omagh St. Endas Club History (published 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redevelopment==
Work began in September 2001 to build a new all-seated covered stand with a capacity of 5,000. The stand was opened in 2004.&lt;ref name="2nd stand"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/gaelic_games/6197863.stm |title=Healy Park to get a second stand |work=BBC online |accessdate=2008-04-02  | date=20 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Healy Park became the first [[Gaelic football]] stadium in [[Ulster]] to have [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlight]]ing installed.&lt;ref name="HoganStand" /&gt;

A modern Press Box and Control Tower was made available at Healy Park for the [[Tyrone Senior Football Championship]] final on Sunday 14 October 2007 between [[Dromore St. Dympna's]] and [[Coalisland Na Fianna]]. New changing rooms and disabled facilities have also been installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omaghstendas.com/ocms/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=117 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316103333/http://www.omaghstendas.com/ocms/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=117 |archivedate=2010-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plans==
[[Tyrone GAA]] has unveiled plans for a second covered stand at Healy Park as the board feels it is time for additional covered and seated accommodation. They also plan to expand the ends behind both goals. Work has already started on the second phase of a £5m redevelopment scheme.&lt;ref name="2nd stand"/&gt;

{{short description| History of diving using self-contained underwater breathing apparatus}}

[[File:Odd Henrik Johnsen Scuba Diving.jpg|thumb|Scuba diver of the late 1960s]]
The '''history of scuba diving''' is closely linked with the history of [[scuba equipment]]. By the turn of the twentieth century, two basic architectures for underwater breathing apparatus had been pioneered; open-circuit surface supplied equipment where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit breathing apparatus where the diver's carbon dioxide is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated. Closed circuit equipment was more easily adapted to scuba in the absence of reliable, portable, and economical high pressure gas storage vessels. By the mid twentieth century, high pressure cylinders were available and two systems for scuba had emerged: [[open-circuit scuba]] where the diver's exhaled breath is vented directly into the water, and [[rebreather|closed-circuit scuba]] where the [[carbon dioxide]] is removed from the diver's exhaled breath which has oxygen added and is recirculated. Oxygen rebreathers are severely depth limited due to oxygen toxicity risk, which increases with depth, and the available systems for mixed gas rebreathers were fairly bulky and designed for use with diving helmets.&lt;ref name="Draegerwerk1899" /&gt; The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer [[Henry Fleuss]] in 1878, while working for [[Siebe Gorman]] in London.&lt;ref name=davis1955 /&gt; His [[self contained breathing apparatus]] consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50–60% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash.&lt;ref name=davis1955/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quick 1970" /&gt; During the 1930s and all through [[World War II]], the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first [[Frogman|frogmen]]. In the U.S. [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Christian J. Lambertsen]] invented an underwater free-swimming [[oxygen rebreather]]. In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA,(an acronym for "self-contained underwater breathing apparatus"),&lt;ref name=patent /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brubakk 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vann 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler 2004" /&gt; which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used due to the risk of convulsions caused by acute [[oxygen toxicity]].&lt;ref name="usn" /&gt;{{rp|1–11}}

Although a working demand regulator system had been invented in 1864 by [[Auguste Denayrouze]] and [[Benoît Rouquayrol]],&lt;ref name="Denayrouze" /&gt; the first open-circuit scuba system developed in 1925 by [[Yves Le Prieur]] in France was a manually adjusted free-flow system with a low endurance, which limited the practical usefulness of the system.&lt;ref name="Le Prieur" /&gt; In 1942, during the German occupation of France, [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] and [[Émile Gagnan]] designed the first successful and safe open-circuit scuba, a twin hose system known as the [[Aqua-Lung]]. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks.&lt;ref name="Cousteau 1953" /&gt; This was patented in 1945. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the [[Aqua-lung|Aqua-Lung]] trademark, which was first licensed to the [[U.S. Divers]] company,&lt;ref name=Grima /&gt; and in 1948 to Siebe Gorman of England,&lt;ref name=Tadpole /&gt; Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. The patent was circumvented by Ted Eldred of [[Melbourne]], Australia, who developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates the first stage and demand valve of the pressure regulator by a low-pressure hose, puts the demand valve at the diver's mouth, and releases exhaled gas through the demand valve casing. Eldred sold the first [[Porpoise (make of scuba gear)|Porpoise]] Model CA single hose scuba early in 1952.&lt;ref name="Byron 2014" /&gt;

Early scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. Many harnesses did not have a backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back.&lt;ref name="Basic Scuba" /&gt; Early scuba divers dived without a buoyancy aid.&lt;ref name="Silent World b" /&gt; In an emergency they had to jettison their weights. In the 1960s [[adjustable buoyancy life jacket]]s (ABLJ) became available, which can be used to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the [[neoprene]] [[wetsuit]] and as a [[lifejacket]] that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit an oral inflation valve and a dump valve lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the [[stabilizer jacket]] was introduced by [[ScubaPro]]. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator.&lt;ref name="Hanauer 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Krestovnikov and Halls 2008" /&gt; A backplate and wing is an alternative configuration of scuba harness with a buoyancy compensation bladder known as a "wing" mounted behind the diver, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder or cylinders. This arrangement became popular with cave divers making long or deep dives, who needed to carry several extra cylinders, as it clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible.&lt;ref name="Jablonski 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mount 2008b" /&gt; Sidemount is a scuba diving equipment configuration which has basic [[scuba sets]], each comprising a single cylinder with a dedicated regulator and pressure gauge,  mounted alongside the diver, clipped to the harness below the shoulders and along the hips, instead of on the back of the diver. It originated as a configuration for advanced [[cave diving]], as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of cave as, sets can be easily removed and remounted when necessary. Sidemount diving has grown in popularity within the [[technical diving]] community for general [[decompression diving]],&lt;ref name="diverwire" /&gt; and has become a  popular specialty for recreational diving.&lt;ref name="Alert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="divernet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="x-ray1" /&gt;

In the 1950s the [[United States Navy]] (USN) documented procedures for military use of what is now called nitrox,&lt;ref name=usn /&gt; and in 1970, [[John Morgan Wells|Morgan Wells]], of  (NOAA) began instituting diving procedures for oxygen-enriched air. In 1979 NOAA published procedures for the scientific use of nitrox in the NOAA Diving Manual.&lt;ref name="NOAA 4th Ed"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dan/&gt; In 1985 IAND (International Association of Nitrox Divers) began teaching nitrox use for recreational diving. After initial resistance by some agencies, the use of a single nitrox mixture has become part of recreational diving, and multiple gas mixtures are common in technical diving to reduce overall decompression time.&lt;ref name="CMASISA TxManual 2006" /&gt; Nitrogen narcosis limits the depth when breathing nitrox mixtures. In 1924 the [[US Navy]] started to investigate the possibility of using helium and after animal experiments, human subjects breathing heliox 20/80 (20% oxygen, 80% helium) were successfully decompressed from deep dives,&lt;ref name=Kane1998 /&gt; Cave divers started using trimix to allow deeper dives and it was used extensively in the 1987 [[Wakulla Springs]] Project and spread to the north-east American wreck diving community.&lt;ref name=Warwick2015 /&gt; The challenges of deeper dives and longer penetrations and the large amounts of breathing gas necessary for these dive profiles and ready availability of oxygen sensing cells beginning in the late 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in rebreather diving. By accurately measuring the partial pressure of oxygen, it became possible to maintain and accurately monitor a breathable gas mixture in the loop at any depth.&lt;ref name="Menduno 2012" /&gt; In the mid 1990s semi-closed circuit rebreathers became available for the recreational scuba market, followed by closed circuit rebreathers around the turn of the millennium.&lt;ref name="Mitchell and Doolette 2013" /&gt; Rebreathers are currently (2018) manufactured for the military, technical and recreational scuba markets.&lt;ref name="Menduno 2012" /&gt;

==Early history==

[[File:Lethbridge diving machine.jpg|thumb|[[John Lethbridge]]'s diving dress, the first enclosed diving suit, built in the 1710s.]]
A scuba set is characterized by full independence from the surface during use, by providing [[breathing gas]] carried by the diver. Early attempts to reach this autonomy were made in the 18th century by the [[England|Englishman]] [[John Lethbridge]], who invented and successfully built his own underwater diving machine in 1715, but though the air supply was carried in the diving apparatus, it relied on surface tenders to deploy and move around under the water, and was effectively an atmospheric pressure [[diving bell]].

An early diving dress using a compressed air reservoir was designed and built in 1771 by ''Sieur''&lt;ref&gt;Old French for "sir" or "Mister"&lt;/ref&gt; Fréminet from [[Paris]]. He conceived an autonomous breathing machine equipped with a reservoir, dragged behind the diver or mounted on his back.&lt;ref name=scaphandre /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perrier 2008" /&gt; Fréminet called his invention ''machine hydrostatergatique'' and used it successfully for more than ten years in the harbors of [[Le Havre]] and [[Brest, France|Brest]], as stated in the explanatory text of a 1784 painting.&lt;ref name="Silent World" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Freminet /&gt;

[[File:Condert diving suit.png|thumb|Diagram of the diving suit invented by Charles Condert of Brooklyn, N.Y. 
&lt;br /&gt; {{unbulleted list |a. Glass viewport |b. Copper pipe bent into arc with closed ends to hold air |c. Slings to support air tank |d. Valve to let air out as needed |e. Pipe to supply air into the suit }}]]
The Frenchman Paul Lemaire d'Augerville built and used autonomous [[diving equipment]] in 1824,&lt;ref name="David 2008" /&gt; as did the British William H. James in 1825. James' helmet was made of "thin copper or sole of leather" with a plate window, and the air was supplied from an iron reservoir.&lt;ref name="Davis1955-563" /&gt; A similar system was used in 1831 by the American Charles Condert, who died in 1832 while testing his invention in the [[East River]] at only {{convert|20|ft|m|0}} deep.&lt;ref name="Franklin inst 1835" /&gt; The oldest known [[oxygen rebreather]] was patented on June 17, 1808 by ''Sieur'' Touboulic from [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[mechanic]] in [[Napoleon]]'s Imperial Navy, but there is no evidence of any prototype having been manufactured. This early rebreather design worked with an oxygen reservoir, the oxygen being delivered progressively by the diver himself and circulating in a closed circuit through a [[Sponge (material)|sponge]] soaked in [[limewater]].&lt;ref name="plongeesout.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="plongeesout 2" /&gt;

After having travelled to England and discovered William James' invention, the French [[physician]] Manuel Théodore Guillaumet, from [[Argentan]] ([[Normandy]]), patented in 1838 the oldest known regulator mechanism. Guillaumet's invention was [[Surface-supplied diving|air-supplied from the surface]] and was never [[Mass production|mass-produced]] due to problems with safety. The oldest practical rebreather relates to the 1849 patent from the Frenchman Pierre Aimable De Saint Simon Sicard.&lt;ref name=Siccard /&gt;

==First successful scuba equipment==

None of those inventions solved the problem of high pressure when compressed air must be supplied to the diver (as in modern regulators); they were mostly based on a [[Diving regulator#Constant flow|constant-flow]] supply of the air. The compression and storage technology was not advanced enough to allow compressed air to be stored in containers at sufficiently high pressures to allow useful dive times.

By the turn of the twentieth century, two basic templates for a scuba had emerged; [[open-circuit scuba]] where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and [[rebreather|closed-circuit scuba]] where the diver's [[carbon dioxide]] is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated.

===Open circuit===
{{see also|Scuba set}}
[[Image:Dykeri, fig 6, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|left|The Rouquayrol-Denayrouze apparatus was the first regulator to be [[Mass production|mass-produced]] (from 1865 to 1965). In this picture the air reservoir presents its surface-supplied configuration.]]
These were the first systems that became popular with recreational divers.  They were safer than early rebreather systems, less expensive to operate, and allowed dives to greater depths.

An important step for the development of open circuit scuba technology was the invention of the [[demand regulator]], a mechanism that conserves air supply by providing air flow only when the outlet pressure is reduced when the diver inhales. In 1864, the French engineers [[Auguste Denayrouze]] and [[Benoît Rouquayrol]] designed and patented their "Rouquayrol-Denayrouze diving suit" after adapting a [[pressure regulator]] and developing it for underwater use. This would be the first diving suit that could automatically supply air to the diver on demand by adjusting the flow of air from the tank to meet the diver’s breathing and pressure requirements. The system still had to use surface supply to provide useful endurance, as the pressure cylinder provided was only a low capacity accumulator.&lt;ref name="Denayrouze" /&gt;

The first open-circuit scuba system was devised in 1925 by [[Yves Le Prieur]] in France. Inspired by the simple ambient pressure supply valve apparatus of [[Maurice Fernez]] and the freedom it allowed the diver, he conceived an idea to make it free of the hose from the surface pump by using Michelin cylinders for the air supply, containing three litres of air compressed to {{convert|150|kg/cm2|psi bar}}. The "Fernez-Le Prieur" diving apparatus was demonstrated at the swimming pool of Tourelles in Paris in 1926. The unit consisted of a cylinder of compressed air carried on the back of the diver, connected to a pressure regulator designed by Le Prieur which was adjusted manually by the diver, with two gauges, one for tank pressure and one for output (supply) pressure. Air was supplied continuously through the mouthpiece and exhausted through a short tube fitted with a valve as in the Fernez design, however, the lack of a demand regulator and the consequent low endurance of the apparatus limited the practical use of LePrieur’s device.&lt;ref name="Le Prieur" /&gt;

Fernez had previously invented a [[noseclip]], a [[Mouthpiece (scuba)|mouthpiece]] fitted with a [[Check valve|one-way valve]] for exhalation and diving [[goggles]], and [[Yves le Prieur]] just added a manually-controlled regulator and a compressed air cylinder to those three elements. Fernez's goggles did not cover the nose, which allows the diver to equalise the internal pressure by letting air flow into the goggles through the nose, so they did not allow a dive deeper than ten metres due to "[[mask squeeze]]". In 1933, Le Prieur replaced all the Fernez equipment (goggles, noseclip and valve) by a [[full face diving mask|full face mask]], directly supplied with constant flow air from the cylinder.&lt;ref name="Le Prieur" /&gt; Le Prieur's design was the first autonomous breathing device used by the first scuba diving clubs in history – ''Racleurs de fond'' founded by [[Glenn Orr]] in [[California]] in 1933, and ''Club des sous-l'eau'' founded by Le Prieur himself in [[Paris]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="Zurcher 2002" /&gt;

In 1942, during the German occupation of France, [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] and [[Émile Gagnan]] designed the first successful and safe open-circuit scuba, known as the [[Aqua-Lung]]. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. [[Émile Gagnan]], an engineer employed by the [[Air Liquide]] company, miniaturized and adapted the regulator manufactured for use with [[gas generator]]s in response to the constant fuel shortage that was a consequence of German requisitioning. Gagnan's boss, Henri Melchior, knew that his son-in-law Jacques-Yves Cousteau was looking for an automatic demand regulator to increase the useful period of the underwater breathing apparatus invented by le Prieur,&lt;ref name="Cousteau 1953" /&gt; so he introduced Cousteau to Gagnan in December 1942. On Cousteau's initiative, Gagnan's regulator was adapted to diving, and the new Cousteau-Gagnan patent was registered some weeks later in 1943.&lt;ref name="Scaphandre 2" /&gt; In 1957, [[Eduard Admetlla i Lázaro]] used a modified version of the Aqua-Lung made by [[Nemrod]] and broke the world record by descending to a depth of {{convert|100|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="vanguardia" /&gt;

===Closed circuit===
{{see|Rebreather|Rebreather diving}}

[[File:Henry Albert Fleuss.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Fleuss]] (1851–1932) improved the [[rebreather]] technology.]]
The alternative concept, developed in roughly the same time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body normally consumes and metabolises only a small fraction of inhaled [[oxygen]]&amp;nbsp;– the situation is even more wasteful of oxygen when the breathing gas is [[Boyle's law|compressed]] as it is in ambient pressure breathing systems underwater. The rebreather recycles the exhaled breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from an oxygen-rich supply so that the oxygen level is not depleted. The apparatus also has to remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels would result in respiratory distress and [[hypercapnia]].

The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer [[Henry Fleuss]] in 1878, while working for [[Siebe Gorman]] in London.&lt;ref name=davis1955 /&gt; His [[self contained breathing apparatus]] consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50–60% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash, the system giving a dive duration of up to about three hours. Fleuss tested his device in 1879 by spending an hour submerged in a water tank, then one week later by diving to a depth of {{convert|5.5|m}} in open water, on which occasion he was slightly injured when his assistants abruptly pulled him to the surface.&lt;ref name=davis1955/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quick 1970" /&gt; This apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by Alexander Lambert, the lead diver on the [[Severn Tunnel]] construction project, who was able to travel {{convert|1000|ft}} in the darkness to close several submerged [[sluice]] doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of [[standard diving dress|standard divers]] due to extremely long distance, along which their air supply hoses became fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings.&lt;ref name=davis1955/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bjorkman" /&gt;

Fleuss continually improved his apparatus, adding a demand regulator and tanks capable of holding greater amounts of oxygen at higher pressure. Sir [[Robert Davis (inventor)|Robert Davis]], head of Siebe Gorman, improved the oxygen rebreather in 1910&lt;ref name=davis1955 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quick 1970" /&gt; with his invention of the [[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus]], the first rebreather to be made in quantity. While intended primarily as an emergency escape apparatus for [[submarine]] crews, it was soon also used for [[Underwater diving|diving]], being a handy shallow water diving apparatus with a thirty-minute endurance, and as an [[Self-contained breathing apparatus|industrial breathing set]].&lt;ref name="Quick 1970" /&gt;

[[File:New Davis Breathing Apparatus Tested at the Submarine Escape Test Tank at HMS Dolphin Gosport, 14 December 1942 A13873.jpg|thumb|left|[[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus]] being tested at the submarine escape test tank at [[HMS Dolphin (shore establishment)|HMS Dolphin, Gosport]], 14 December 1942.]]
The rig comprised a rubber breathing/buoyancy bag containing a canister of [[barium hydroxide]] to absorb exhaled carbon dioxide and, in a pocket at the lower end of the bag, a steel pressure cylinder holding approximately {{convert|56|l|cuft}} of oxygen at a pressure of {{convert|120|bar|psi}} which was equipped with a control valve and connected to the [[breathing bag]]. Opening the cylinder's valve admitted oxygen to the bag at ambient pressure. The rig also included an emergency buoyancy bag on its front to help keep the wearer afloat. After further development by Davis in 1927 the DSEA was adopted by the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name="Kemp 1990" /&gt;

In 1911 Dräger of Lubeck tested a self-contained rebreather system for standard diving equipment, which used an injector system to circulate the breathing gas through the breathing loop and scrubber. This was put into service soon thereafter and was available in two versions, an oxygen rebreather DM20 for depths shallower than 20m, and a nitrox rebreather DM40 for depths up to 40m.&lt;ref name="Draegerwerk1899" /&gt;

During the 1930s and all through [[World War II]], the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first [[Frogman|frogmen]]. The British adapted the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus and the Germans adapted the [[Drägerwerk|Dräger]] submarine escape rebreathers, for their frogmen during the war.&lt;ref name="Diving Heritage" /&gt;

The Italians developed similar rebreathers for the combat swimmers of the [[Decima Flottiglia MAS]], especially the [[Pirelli ARO]].&lt;ref name=Pirelli /&gt; In the U.S. [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Christian J. Lambertsen]] invented an underwater free-swimming [[oxygen rebreather]] in 1939, which was accepted by the [[Office of Strategic Services]].&lt;ref name="Shapiro" /&gt; In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA,(an acronym for "self-contained underwater breathing apparatus"),&lt;ref name=patent /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brubakk 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vann 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler 2004" /&gt; which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used due to the risk of convulsions caused by acute [[oxygen toxicity]].

Air Liquide started selling the Cousteau-Gagnan regulator commercially in 1946 under the name of ''scaphandre Cousteau-Gagnan'' or CG45 ("C" for Cousteau, "G" for Gagnan and 45 for the 1945 patent). The same year Air Liquide created a division called ''[[La Spirotechnique]]'', to develop and sell regulators and other diving equipment. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the [[Aqua-lung|Aqua-Lung]] trademark, which was first licensed to the [[U.S. Divers]] company.(the American division of Air Liquide) and later sold with La Spirotechnique and U.S. Divers to finally become the name of the company, Aqua-Lung/La Spirotechnique, currently located in [[Carros]], near [[Nice]].&lt;ref name=Grima /&gt;

In 1948 the Cousteau-Gagnan patent was also licensed to [[Siebe Gorman]] of England,&lt;ref name=Tadpole /&gt; Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. This patent was circumvented by Ted Eldred of [[Melbourne]], Australia, who had been developing a rebreather called the Porpoise. When a demonstration of this rebreather resulted in a diver passing out, he developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates the first stage and demand valve of the pressure regulator by a low-pressure hose, puts the demand valve at the diver's mouth, and releases exhaled gas through the demand valve casing. Eldred sold the first [[Porpoise (make of scuba gear)|Porpoise]] Model CA single hose scuba early in 1952.&lt;ref name="Byron 2014" /&gt;

Early scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually quick-release, and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses did not have a backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back.&lt;ref name="Basic Scuba" /&gt;

Early scuba divers dived without a buoyancy aid.&lt;ref name="Silent World b" /&gt; In an emergency they had to jettison their weights. In the 1960s [[adjustable buoyancy life jacket]]s (ABLJ) became available, which can be used to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the [[neoprene]] [[wetsuit]] and as a [[lifejacket]] that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, and that can be quickly inflated. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the [[stabilizer jacket]] was introduced by [[ScubaPro]]. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator.&lt;ref name="Hanauer 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Krestovnikov and Halls 2008" /&gt;

A backplate and wing is an alternative configuration of scuba harness with a buoyancy compensation bladder known as a "wing" mounted behind the diver, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder or cylinders. Unlike stabilizer jackets, the backplate and wing is a modular system, in that it consists of separable components. This arrangement became popular with cave divers making long or deep dives, who needed to carry several extra cylinders, as it clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible. This additional equipment is usually suspended from the harness or carried in pockets on the exposure suit.&lt;ref name="Jablonski 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mount 2008b" /&gt;

In 1911 [[Drägerwerk|Draeger]] of Germany tested an injector operated rebreather backpack for a [[standard diving]] suit. This concept was produced and marketed as the DM20 oxygen rebreather system and the DM40 nitrox rebreather system, in which air from one cylinder and oxygen from a second cylinder were mixed during injection through a nozzle which circulated the breathing gas through the scrubber and the rest of the loop. The DM40 was rated for depths up to 40m.&lt;ref name="Draegerwerk1899" /&gt; In the 1950s the [[United States Navy]] (USN) documented enriched oxygen gas procedures for military use of what we today call nitrox, in the USN Diving Manual,&lt;ref name=usn /&gt; and in 1970, [[John Morgan Wells|Morgan Wells]], who was the first director of the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) Diving Center, began instituting diving procedures for oxygen-enriched air. In 1979 NOAA published Wells' procedures for the scientific use of nitrox in the NOAA Diving Manual.&lt;ref name="NOAA 4th Ed"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dan/&gt; In 1985 [[Dick Rutkowski]], a former NOAA [[diving safety officer]], formed IAND (International Association of Nitrox Divers) and began teaching nitrox use for recreational diving. This was considered dangerous by some, and met with heavy skepticism by the diving community.&lt;ref name=Lang2006 /&gt; Nevertheless, in 1992 [[National Association of Underwater Instructors|NAUI]] became the first existing major recreational diver training agency to sanction nitrox,&lt;ref name=NAUIhx /&gt; and eventually, in 1996, the [[Professional Association of Diving Instructors]] (PADI) announced full educational support for nitrox.&lt;ref name=padi/&gt; The use of a single nitrox mixture has become part of recreational diving, and multiple gas mixtures are common in technical diving to reduce overall decompression time.&lt;ref name="CMASISA TxManual 2006" /&gt;

[[File:TechDiving NOAA.jpg|thumb|Technical diver during a decompression stop]]
Technical diving is recreational scuba diving that exceeds the generally accepted recreational limits, and may expose the diver to hazards beyond those normally associated with recreational diving, and to greater risks of serious injury or death. These risks may be reduced by appropriate skills, knowledge and experience, and by using suitable equipment and procedures. The term ''[[technical diving]]'' has been credited to [[Michael Menduno]], who was editor of the (now defunct) diving magazine ''aquaCorps Journal''.&lt;ref name="Gilliam 1995" /&gt; The concept and term are both relatively recent advents, although divers had already been engaging in what is now commonly referred to as technical diving for decades. In his 1989 book, ''Advanced Wreck Diving'', author and leading technical diver, [[Gary Gentile]], commented that there was no accepted term for divers who dived beyond agency-specified recreational limits for non-professional purposes.&lt;ref name="Gentile 1988" /&gt; Revised editions use the term technical diving, and Gentile published a further book in 1999 entitled ''The Technical Diving Handbook''.&lt;ref name="Gentile 1999" /&gt;

There is some professional disagreement as to what exactly technical diving encompasses.&lt;ref name=Gorman92 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gorman95/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamilton96 /&gt; Nitrox diving and rebreather diving were originally considered technical, but this is no longer universally the case as several certification agencies now offer recreational nitrox and recreational rebreather training and certification.&lt;ref name="Rossier 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GUE 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Menduno 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PADI Rebreather diver" /&gt; Even those who agree on the broad definitions of technical diving may disagree on the precise boundaries between technical and recreational diving. One reasonably widely held definition is that any dive in which at some point of the planned profile it is not physically possible or physiologically acceptable to make a direct and uninterrupted vertical ascent to surface air is a technical dive.&lt;ref name="Menduno 2012" /&gt; The equipment often involves breathing gases other than air or standard [[nitrox]] mixtures, multiple gas sources, and different equipment configurations.&lt;ref name=Richardson/&gt; Over time, some equipment and techniques developed for technical diving have become more widely accepted for recreational diving.&lt;ref name="Menduno 2012" /&gt;

Nitrogen narcosis limits the depth reachable by underwater divers when breathing nitrox mixtures. In 1924 the [[US Navy]] started to investigate the possibility of using helium and after animal experiments, human subjects breathing heliox 20/80 (20% oxygen, 80% helium) were successfully decompressed from deep dives,&lt;ref name=Kane1998 /&gt; followed by salvage diver [[Max Nohl|Max "Gene" Nohl's]] dive to 127 meters in 1937.&lt;ref name=Nohl1937 /&gt; and the 1939 US Navy salvage of [[USS Sailfish (SS-192)|USS ''Squalus'']].&lt;ref name=dive_hx/&gt; In 1963 saturation dives using trimix were made during [[George F. Bond#Project Genesis|Project Genesis]],&lt;ref name=Bond1964 /&gt; and in 1979 a research team at the Duke University Medical Center Hyperbaric Laboratory started work which identified the use of trimix to prevent High Pressure Nervous Syndrome symptoms.&lt;ref name=CamporesiDAN/&gt; Cave divers started using trimix to allow deeper dives and it was used extensively in the 1987 [[Wakulla Springs]] Project and spread to the north-east American wreck diving community, and by 1994 [[John Chatterton]] and [[Gary Gentile]], dived on the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'' expedition to a depth of 100 meters using trimix.&lt;ref name=Warwick2015 /&gt;

[[File:Trevor Jackson returns from SS Kyogle.jpg|thumb|left|Rebreather diver returning from a {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on|0}} dive]]
The challenges of deeper dives and longer penetrations and the large amounts of breathing gas necessary for these dive profiles reawakened interest in rebreathers. The ready availability of oxygen sensing cells beginning in the late 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in rebreather diving. By accurately measuring the partial pressure of oxygen, it became possible to maintain and accurately monitor a breathable gas mixture in the loop at any depth.&lt;ref name="Menduno 2012" /&gt; In the mid 1990s semi-closed circuit rebreathers became available for the recreational scuba market, followed by closed circuit rebreathers around the turn of the millennium.&lt;ref name="Mitchell and Doolette 2013" /&gt; Rebreathers are currently (2018) manufactured for the military, technical and recreational scuba markets.&lt;ref name="Menduno 2012" /&gt;

[[File:Sidemount 032 Photo by Pete Nawrocky.jpg|thumb|Sidemount diver pushing a cylinder in front]]
Sidemount is a scuba diving equipment configuration which has basic [[scuba sets]], each comprising a single cylinder with a dedicated regulator and pressure gauge,  mounted alongside the diver, clipped to the harness below the shoulders and along the hips, instead of on the back of the diver. It originated as a configuration for advanced [[cave diving]], as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of cave as, sets can be easily removed and remounted when necessary. The configuration allows easy access to cylinder valves, and provides easy and reliable gas redundancy.  These benefits for operating in confined spaces were also recognized by divers who made [[wreck diving]] penetrations. Sidemount diving is now growing in popularity within the [[technical diving]] community for general [[decompression diving]],&lt;ref name="diverwire" /&gt; and has become a  popular specialty for recreational diving, with several [[diver certification agencies]] offering recreational and technical level sidemount training programs.&lt;ref name="Alert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="divernet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="x-ray1" /&gt;

===Dive computers===
{{see|Dive computer}}
[[Image:Dive computer logbook.jpg|right|thumb|[[Uwatec]] Aladin Pro dive computer showing the log of a previous dive]]
Scuba decompression planning originally based on printed decompression tables developed for surface supplied air diving. This was inefficient for multi-level dives, and the custom of multilevel diving using tables was not supported by formal experimental testing, but seemed to work reasonably well in practice in accordance with the theoretical models.

The [[Office of Naval Research]] funded a project with the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]] for the theoretical design of a prototype decompression [[analog computer]]. The Foxboro Decomputer, Mark I was manufactured by the Foxboro Company and evaluated by the [[United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit|US Navy Experimental Diving Unit]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Searle 1957" /&gt; Confusion between the diffusivity coefficient and the then new concept of tissue half time resulted in a device that did not properly mirror decompression status. Had this error not occurred, the U.S. Navy Tables might never have been developed, and divers might have been using instrumentation to control their dives from 1957 on.

The first [[recreational diving|recreational]] mechanical [[analog computer|analogue dive computer]], the "decompression meter" was designed by the Italians De Sanctis &amp; Alinari in 1959 and built in their factory named SOS, which also made depth gauges. The decompression meter was distributed directly by SOS and also by scuba diving equipment firms such as Scubapro and Cressi. It was very simple in principle: a waterproof bladder filled with gas inside a big casing bled into a smaller chamber through a semi-porous ceramic cartridge (to simulate tissue in/out gassing). The chamber pressure was measured by a [[Pressure measurement#Bourdon|bourdon tube]], calibrated to indicate decompression status. The device functioned so poorly that it was eventually nicknamed "bendomatic".&lt;ref name=RRR10177 /&gt;

In 1965, Stubbs and Kidd applied their decompression model to a pneumatic analogue decompression computer.&lt;ref name="Stubbs and Kidd 1965" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stubbs and Kidd 1965b" /&gt;

Several analogue decompression meters were subsequently made, some with several bladders for illustrating the effect on various body tissues, but they were sidelined with the arrival on the scene of electronic computers.

In 1983,&lt;ref name="Seveke" /&gt; the [[Hans Hass]]-''DecoBrain'', designed by ''Divetronic AG'' a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] start-up, became the first decompression diving computer, capable of displaying the information that today's diving computers do. The DecoBrain was based on A. Bühlmann's 16 compartment (ZHL-12) tissue model&lt;ref name=RRR9434 /&gt; which Jürg Hermann, an electronic engineer implemented in 1981 on one of Intel's first single-chip microcontrollers as part of his thesis at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]].

The 1984 Orca EDGE was an early example of a dive computer.&lt;ref name=RRR9434/&gt; Designed by [[List of United States Virgin Islands Senators|Craig Barshinger]] [[Karl Huggins]] and Paul Heinmiller, the EDGE did not display a decompression plan, but instead the EDGE showed the ceiling or the so-called "safe-ascent-depth". A drawback was that if the diver was faced by a ceiling, he did not know how long he would have to decompress. The EDGE's large, unique display, however, featuring 12 tissue bars permitted an experienced user to make a reasonable estimate of his or her decompression obligation.

In 1984 the US Navy diving computer (UDC) which was based on a 9 tissue model of [[Edward D. Thalmann]] of the Naval Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU), Panama City, who developed the US Navy tables. ''Divetronic AG'' completed the UDC development – as it had been started by the chief engineer Kirk Jennings of the Naval Ocean System Center, Hawaii, and Thalmann of the NEDU – by adapting the Deco Brain for US Navy warfare use and for their 9-tissue MK-15 mixgas model under an R&amp;D contract of the US Navy.

Orca Industries continued to refine their technology with the release of the Skinny-dipper in 1987 to do calculations for repetitive diving.&lt;ref name=RRR10185 /&gt; They later released the Delphi computer in 1989 that included calculations for diving at altitude as well as profile recording.&lt;ref name=RRR10185/&gt;

Even by the late 1980s, the advent of dive computers had not met with what might be considered widespread acceptance. Combined with the general mistrust, at the time, of taking a piece of electronics that your life might depend upon underwater, there were also objections expressed ranging from dive resorts felt that the increased bottom time would upset their boat and meal schedules, to that knowledgeable divers felt that the increased bottom time would, regardless of the claims, result in many more cases of [[decompression sickness]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Understanding the need for clear communication and debate, Michael Lang of the California State University at San Diego and [[Robert William Hamilton, Jr.|Bill Hamilton]] of Hamilton Research Ltd. brought together, under the auspices of the [[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] a diverse group that included most of the dive computer designers and manufacturers, some of the best known hyperbaric medicine theorists and practitioners, representatives from the recreational diving agencies, the cave diving community and the scientific diving community.

The basic issue was made clear by Andrew A. Pilmanis in his introductory remarks: "It is apparent that dive computers "are here to stay" but are still in the early stages of development. From this perspective, this workshop can begin the process of establishing standard evaluation procedures for assuring safe and effective utilization of dive computers in scientific diving."&lt;ref name=aaus /&gt;

After meeting for two days the conferees were still in, "the early stages of development," and the "process of establishing standard evaluation procedures for assuring safe and effective utilization of dive computers in scientific diving," had not really begun. [[University of Rhode Island]] [[Diving Safety Officer]] [[Aquanaut|Phillip Sharkey]] and ORCA EDGE's Director of Research and Development, prepared a 12-point proposal that they invited the [[Diving safety officer|Diving Safety Officers]] (DSO) in attendance to discuss at an evening closed meeting. Those attending included: Jim Stewart ([[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]), Lee Somers ([[University of Michigan]]), Mark Flahan ([[San Diego State University]]), Woody Southerland ([[Duke University]]), John Heine ([[Moss Landing Marine Laboratories]]), Glen Egstrom ([[University of California, Los Angeles]]), John Duffy ([[California Department of Fish and Game]]), and James Corry ([[United States Secret Service]]). Over the course of several hours the suggestion prepared by Sharkey and Heinmiller was edited and turned into the following 13 recommendations:

# Only those makes and models of dive computers specifically approved by the Diving Control Board may be used. 
# Any diver desiring the approval to use a dive computer as a means of determining decompression status must apply to the Diving Control Board, complete an appropriate practical training session and pass a written examination. 
# Each diver relying on a dive computer to plan dives and indicate or determine decompression status must have his own unit. 
# On any given dive, both divers in the buddy pair must follow the most conservative dive computer. 
# If the dive computer fails at any time during the dive, the dive must be terminated and appropriate surfacing procedures should be initiated immediately. 
# A diver should not dive for 18 hours before activating a dive computer to use it to control his diving. 
# Once the dive computer is in use, it must not be switched off until it indicates complete outgassing has occurred or 18 hours have elapsed, whichever comes first. 
# When using a dive computer, non-emergency ascents are to be at the rate specified for the make and model of dive computer being used. 
# Ascent rates shall not exceed 40 fsw/min in the last 60 fsw. 
# Whenever practical, divers using a dive computer should make a stop between 10 and 30 feet for 5 minutes, especially for dives below 60 fsw. 
# Only 1 dive on the dive computer in which the NDL of the tables or dive computer has been exceeded may be made in any 18-hour period. 
# Repetitive and multi-level diving procedures should start the dive, or series of dives, at the maximum planned depth, followed by subsequent dives of shallower exposures. 
# Multiple deep dives require special consideration.
 
As recorded in "Session 9: General discussion and concluding remarks:" 
"Mike Lang next lead the group discussion to reach consensus on the guidelines for use of dive computers. These 13 points had been thoroughly discussed and compiled the night before, so that most of the additional comments were for clarification and precision. The following items are the guidelines for use of dive computers for the scientific diving community. It was again reinforced that almost all of these guidelines were also applicable to the diving community at large.&lt;ref name=aaus/&gt;"

The remarkable thing about this process is that after the AAUS workshop the opposition to dive computers crumbled, numerous new models were introduced, the technology dramatically improved and dive computers became, virtually overnight, the standard pieces of diving equipment that they are today.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 2001, the US Navy approved the use of Cochran NAVY decompression computer with the VVAL 18 [[Thalmann algorithm]] for Special Warfare operations.&lt;ref name="Butler and Southerland 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;

In 2008, the [[Underwater Digital Interface]] (UDI) was released to the market. This dive computer, based on the RGBM model, includes an underwater communication system that enables divers to transmit text messages, also featuring SOS and homing capabilities, and digital 3D compass.&lt;ref name="utc" /&gt;

===Industry growth===

{{expand section|date=February 2018}}
Recreational scuba diving industry diving experienced major growth at the end of the 20th century. Number of new divers per year has stabilised since then. Estimated 1 million new divers were certified in 2012.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Scuba diving remains a dynamic recreation - there is continuous development of equipment and practices.

Many recreational divers trained every year, but most do not appear to dive very often. Large dropout rate after initial and advanced training.

Industry sectors:
*Diver training - commercialisation of training, breaking training down into smaller components for diver convenience and industry profit
*Equipment sales - wide range of equipment, catering for fashion and personal preferences as well as technical necessity, safety and effectiveness
*Consumables sales and equipment maintenance - supporting the astablished diver as well as the novice and occasional diver.
*Dive charters, guided dives - targeting vacationers and travellers to exotic destinations.

Professional scuba industry much lower numbers, but higher levels of training, and lower droput rate. Greater motivation as it is part of the job. Probably insignificant to the industry as a whole. Slightly different equipment use. Military scuba supports some manufacturers of specialised equipment

=== Professional scuba training and certification ===
Professional diving is done as a part of the work the diver is employed to do, and as such is generally subject to occupational health and safety regulation. This extends to training, certification and the asssociated training standards.&lt;ref name="Diving at Work Regulations 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="29 CFR scope" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;
Commercial diver training is often regulated by national or state government, so details and standards tend to vary internationally, but there are systems in place for recognition of minimum standards between jurisdictions, allowing some international portability of commercial diver certification. In some jurisdictions a distinction is made between industrial commercial diving and professional diving as part of scientific or public safety occupations, where a variety of regulatory exemptions may apply. In  situations where exemptions apply, the training and certification through recreational agencies may be recognised for professional diving activities where this is not permitted for industrial commercial diving.
Military diving is frequently independent of commercial diving regulation, and military diver training is usually controlled by the armed forces which employ the divers. In some cases there is recognition of military diver qualifications for work in the civilian industry, in other cases not.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;&lt;!-- refs SANOPS 96 and equivalents --&gt;

The [[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] (AAUS) is a group of scientific organizations and individual members who conduct scientific and educational activities underwater. It was organized in 1977 and incorporated in the [[State of California]] in 1983. The purpose of the AAUS is to facilitate the development of safe and productive [[Professional diving#Scientific diving|scientific divers]] and scientific diving procedures through education, research, advocacy, and the advancement of the AAUS Standards for Scientific Diving Certification and Operation of Scientific Diving Programs. These are the consensual guidelines for scientific diving programs in the US, and are recognized by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] as the "Standard" for scientific diving. These standards are followed by all AAUS Organizational Members allowing for [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] between institutions. Each institution is responsible for upholding the standards within its program and among its divers. The AAUS [[peer review]]s the standards on a regular basis, so they represent the consensus of the scientific diving community and state-of-the-art technologies.&lt;ref name="AAUS Standards" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AAUS Exemption" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharkey and Austin" /&gt;

The [[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques#Scientific Committee|CMAS Scientific committee]] compiled and edited the [[UNESCO]] Code of Practice for Scientific diving between 1977 and the publication of the document as ''Unesco technical papers in marine science  53'' in 1988.&lt;ref name="Flemming" /&gt;

The [[International Diving Schools Association]] (IDSA) was formed in 1982 with the primary purpose of developing common international standards for commercial diver training.&lt;ref name=IDSA /&gt; The Association has published basic tables for international comparison of training standards for commercial divers and some specialist non-diving qualifications such as diving supervisors, diving medical technicians and life support technicians based on consensus of members.&lt;ref name="IDSA standards" /&gt;

The [[International Diving Regulators Forum]] (IDRF) confirmed its principals and purpose at their meeting in London in September 2009.  The statement of principals and purpose states "The forum has agreed to work together towards mutual recognition to identify and implement best practice in diver training and assessment with the objective of harmonising cross-border diver training outside Europe."&lt;ref name="EDTC 2010" /&gt; The organisation has since changed its name to [[International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum]] (IDRCF)&lt;ref name="bell diver 2017" /&gt; Members of the IDRF include [[Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme|ADAS]] (Australia), DCBC (Canada), HSE (UK), PSA (Norway), and the Secretariat General to the Sea Progress Committee (France).&lt;ref name="EDTC 2010" /&gt;

=== Recreational scuba training and certification ===
The need for formalised training was recognised due to the high number of recreational scuba accidents. this started with informal training and led to the creation of training and certification agencies. BS-AC was formed in 1953,&lt;ref name=BSAChxBook /&gt; CMAS in 1959,&lt;ref name="aboutcmas" /&gt; NAUI in 1960&lt;ref name="Flamar" /&gt; and PADI in 1966.&lt;ref name=cronin /&gt;

The sport of scuba diving had its roots among the multitude of small enthusiastic snorkelling and spearfishing clubs in the decades just before and after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Dugan 1965" /&gt;{{rp|ch.12}} After the invention of the "aqualung" by [[Jacques Cousteau|Cousteau]] and [[Gagnan]], the first commercially marketed underwater breathing apparatus became available for sale for sporting purposes in the late 1940s.
In 1951, Jim Auxie Jr and Chuck Blakeslee started a magazine called ''The Skin Diver'' (later renamed ''Skin Diver Magazine'').{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Neal Earl Hess, who had been teaching divers for two years, contributed to its column "The Instructors Corner",  to inform readers about scuba.&lt;ref name="Flamar" /&gt; He soon established a column called "The National Diving Patrol" as a section to name new skin and scuba diving "instructors".&lt;ref name="Midwest" /&gt; Still, no official training and certifying agency existed, except for the training and resources provided by the military (Underwater Demolition Teams) and dive clubs.&lt;ref name="Midwest" /&gt;

Graduate students Conrad Limbaugh and Andy Rechnitzer used two of the first aqualungs brought to the US in 1948 on the California coast and nenrolled at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1950, where they informally tutored some of their colleagues.  After a student diver at another university died in a scuba accident in 1952, Scripps administration got Limbaugh to produce the first formal scuba training manual and course in the US.&lt;ref name="Brylske 2012" /&gt;

In 1952, Al Tillman, the director of sports for the [[Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation]], wrote a letter&lt;ref name="LA County" /&gt; to Parks and Recreation director Paul Gruendyke stating that: “A new sport—skin diving—is becoming popular in the area. Recently while diving in [[Palos Verdes]], I ran into several divers in the water with me who didn’t know what they were doing. One had one of the new underwater breathing units that allows divers to stay under for long periods of time... I propose that my department get involved in this sport and provide training classes. I believe that diving will grow in the future and we have an obligation to make the sport as safe as possible."&lt;ref name="Midwest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAUI history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Club history" /&gt;

On 15 October 1953, the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] (BSAC) was founded by [[Oscar Gugen]], Peter Small, Mary Small, and [[Trevor Hampton]]&lt;ref name=BSAChxBook /&gt;&lt;ref name=BSAChxWeb /&gt;

The Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation sent three representatives - Al Tillman, Bev Morgan and Ramsey Parks - to take Limbaugh's course in 1954. They subsequently started training recreational scuba divers, making this the first scuba instructor training in America.&lt;ref name="Brylske 2012" /&gt; In 1955, Tillman and L.A. County lifeguard Bev Morgan created the L.A. County Parks and Recreational Underwater Instructor Certification Course (1UICC) in an effort to respond to the growing number of diver requests.&lt;ref name="Lifeguard" /&gt; It was the world’s first civilian training program to certify recreational divers, and soon began granting Provisional Certification to instructors across the country.&lt;ref name="Midwest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollows and Bell 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ProQuest" /&gt;

As the new sport of scuba diving rapidly expanded through the 1950s, several sporting organisations – notably the [[YMCA]] – began programmes to train swimming enthusiasts in this new aquatic pastime and began to codify what were believed to be the proper practices needed for this expanding amateur sport.&lt;ref name="Dugan 1965"/&gt;{{rp|292–295}} The YMCA formed a committee to produce a training manual - "The New Science of Skin and Scuba Diving", which was first published in 1957, and in 1959 conducted the first national instructor training program.&lt;ref name="Brylske 2012" /&gt;

In the 1960 May issue of ''Skin Diver Magazine'', The National Diving Patrol was announced as an official, national organization. Its purpose and function was "to insure competent underwater instruction and to reduce diving accidents through education."&lt;ref name="Icorn" /&gt; In 1959, its name changed to the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI).&lt;ref name="Midwest" /&gt; In October 1961, NAUI was incorporated in the State of California as a non-profit educational organization, with Al Tillman as the President and Neal Hess as the Executive Secretary.&lt;ref name="Midwest" /&gt; In 1966 Ralph Ericson and John Cronin formed the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) in response to a perception that the existing system was not sufficiently responsive to the needs of inland diving instructors. A further split occurred in 1967 with the creation of the National Association of Scuba Diving Schools (NASDS) by John Gaffney and a group of diving equipment retailers, followed by a split from NASDS led by Bob Clark to form Scuba Schools International (SSI) in 1970.&lt;ref name="Brylske 2012" /&gt;

The Florida Skin Divers Association was formed from a group of local scuba diving clubs in 1952. In 1976 their scuba training committee split from FSDA to form the International Diving Educators Association (IDEA).&lt;ref name="Brylske 2012" /&gt;

Early scuba training included a large component of theory provided by classroom instruction, which could include more than 30 hours of physics, equipment mechanics and other theoretical aspects of diving knowledge. The skills training included fitness, watermanship skills and stress management training, where staff would put the learner diver through in-water situations simulating the most likely emergency situations, so that the divers would be more likely to manage real life emegencies with composure. Much of this training was, and still is, part of commercial and military diver training. This training required the diver to show competence at both routine procedures and managing reasonably foreseeable emergencies - much the same requirement that persists for certification of professional divers. This approach could be justified by the unsophisticated equipment in use, which could be, and often was, serviced by the diver, and was more prone to malfunctions than later generation equipment. Current standard equipment such as submersible pressure gauges, buoyancy compensators and decompression computers were not available, and the recreational diver was obliged to avoid decompression illness by planning the dive and monitoring the planned dive using a diving watch, simple depth gauge, and decompression tables, sometimes shared with a companion. In the event of an equipment malfunction, the diver was unsupported except by a diving companion. This required a level of competence and discipline that is no longer considered essential for recreational diving by most certification agencies.&lt;ref name="Brylske 2012" /&gt;

By the late 1960s equipment was becoming more reliable, and the recreational diver was less likely to experience malfunctions, but the training remained much the same. An increased interest in diving among the general public, and the commercial drive to sell more equipment and training began to change the content and methods of training to a more widely marketable model in the mid 1970s. This included expanding the training to include open-water experience, which was previously not a universal requirement. By the 1970s a second open-water checkout was standard, and more were subsequently added in recognition that training in the actual environment where the skills will be used is important to develop competence. By the 1980s the current minimum requirement for open water diving of four training dives was well established.&lt;ref name="Brylske 2012" /&gt;&lt;!--Note: this applies to US training, and may not follow the pattern of Europe, where BSAC and CMAS were influential. --&gt;

At the same time, classroom and confined water instruction changed to adapt to the changes on equipment, and to de-emphasise fundamental theory in favour of practical applications more likely to be useful in the expected range of experience for a recreational diver. The general acceptance of the buoyancy compensator, submersible pressure gauge, and alternate air supply in the form of a secondary demand valve as standard equipment changed the preferred emergency procedures for handling out-of-air emergencies, which were simpler to learn as well as reducing the risk. The buoyancy compensator also allowed training to focus on better buoyancy control and alternative methods of establishing appropriate buoyancy. Stress management was de-emphasised, and skills training concentrated on learning the standardised skill set known to be effective most of the time. These changes helped to allow a wider range of potential divers to enter the market.&lt;ref name="Brylske 2012" /&gt;

The buddy system had been thought to be a useful corollary to the "never swim alone" edicts of the YMCA swimming and lifesaving programmes. Cousteau himself independently implemented a buddy system from the earliest days of exploratory diving after a number of diving incidents.&lt;ref name="Hanna 2006" /&gt; The buddy system did indeed have some very useful aspects: the cross checking of equipment before dives, the facilitating of assistance for possible entanglement problems or equipment failures, and the enhancement of the social nature of diving. The YMCA continued as a major force in the development of [[diver certification]] during the first 50 years of this new sport. When these programmes were adopted by the emerging scuba certification agencies such as BS-AC, NAUI and PADI, the practice of buddy diving led to one of the two main mantras of recreational scuba: "never hold your breath" and "never dive alone".&lt;ref name="Brennan 1970" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brylske 1994" /&gt;

An international congress of fifteen diving federations representing all underwater disciplines met in [[Brussels]] on 28 September 1958. National delegates attended from [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[France]], Federal Republic of [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Monaco]], [[Portugal]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States of America]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Following a decision at that congress, a meeting was held in [[Monaco]] on 9–11 January 1959, which officially established the [[World Underwater Federation]], with an [[acronym]] ''CMAS'' based on its French title ''Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques''.&lt;ref name="aboutcmas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt;

The [[Professional Association of Diving Instructors]] (PADI) is a [[recreational diving]] membership and [[List of diver certification organizations|diver training organization]] founded in 1966 by [[John Cronin (diver)|John Cronin]] and Ralph Erickson.&lt;ref name=cronin /&gt; Cronin was originally a [[National Association of Underwater Instructors|NAUI]] instructor who decided to form his own organization with Erickson, and to break [[Recreational diver training|diver training]] down into several modular courses instead of the single universal course then prevalent.&lt;ref name="Tilman" /&gt; [[Diving Science and Technology]] Corporation (DSAT), the development arm for the [[Recreational Dive Planner]] and PADI's Tec-Rec program, was founded in November 1986.&lt;ref name="Hamilton et al 1994" /&gt;

[[Dick Rutkowski]], previously a dive supervisor for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), formed the International Association of Nitrox Divers (IAND) in 1985 to teach the use of [[nitrox]], which had been pioneered by NOAA, to recreational divers. In 1992 the name was changed to the International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD).&lt;ref name="about iantd" /&gt;

[[Technical Diving International]] (TDI) was founded in 1994 by [[Bret Gilliam]], and others after a split from IANTD in 1993&lt;ref name="Our story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="liquidedge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boan" /&gt; to provide training for specialized diving situations. TDI courses include open circuit Nitrox,&lt;ref name="Nitrox" /&gt; Trimix and [[Rebreather]] &lt;ref name="Rebreather" /&gt; courses, and training for overhead environments like caves and wrecks.&lt;ref name="DeeperBlue" /&gt; In 1998, International Training started a sister organization to TDI known as [[Scuba Diving International]] (SDI) focusing on [[Recreational diving|recreational scuba]]&lt;ref name="DISRC" /&gt; and in 2000, [[Emergency Response Diving International]] (ERDI) to teach [[public safety diving]].

Following the recognition that solo diving does occur, is acceptably safe to many divers, and is a relatively common practice, Scuba Diving International (SDI) started Solo diving training and certification in 1999.&lt;ref name="SDI solo launch" /&gt;

In 2006 BSAC was the first recreational diving agency to introduce [[Nitrox]] diving as part of core training.&lt;ref name=BSAChxWeb/&gt;&lt;ref name=BSACnitrox /&gt;

Internationally recognised minimum training standards for recreational divers have been published by: RSTC, WRSTC, CMAS, ISO etc.( Rebreather training council?)

The US [[Recreational Scuba Training Council]] (RSTC) was created in 1986 as a permanent body to sustain a relationship between various recreational diving training organisations.  In 1991, it replaced the Diving Equipment Manufacturers Association (DEMA) (renamed as the [[Diving Equipment and Marketing Association]] in 1998) as the secretariat for the then [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) committee for underwater safety (also known as the Z86 Committee). The Z86 committee was subsequently replaced by the committee for Diving Instructional Standards and Safety (also known as the Z375 committee).&lt;ref name=Brylske /&gt; In 2007 it retained its appointment as the ANSI Accredited Standards Developer (ASD) for the Z375 committee.&lt;ref name="ANSI" /&gt;

The US RSTC has been responsible for the development of a standard medical statement (in conjunction with the [[Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society]]) and minimum training standards for [[Diver communications#Hand signals|diving hand signals]] and the following recreational diver grades - Introductory Scuba Experience, Supervised Diver, [[Open Water Diver]], [[Nitrox|Enriched Air Nitrox Certification]], [[Rescue Diver|Entry level Rescue Diver]], [[Divemaster|Dive Supervisor]], Assistant Instructor, [[Diving instructor|Scuba Instructor]] and Scuba Instructor Trainer for member agencies.&lt;ref name="Richardson 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WRSTC standards" /&gt;

The [[World Recreational Scuba Training Council]] (WRSTC) was founded in 1999 to create minimum [[recreational diving]] training standards for the various [[scuba diving]] certification agencies across the world which are members. The WRSTC restricts its membership to national or regional councils. These councils consist of individual training organizations who collectively represent at least 50% of the annual diver certifications in the member council's country or region.&lt;ref name="WRSTC mission" /&gt; A national council is referred to as a RSTC (Recreational Scuba Training Council).

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published minimum standards in 2007 (superseded by 2014 revisions) for:
* ISO 24801-1:2014 Recreational diving services - Requirements for the training of recreational scuba divers - Part 1: Level 1 - Supervised diver,&lt;ref name="ISO24801-1"/&gt; 
* ISO 24801-2:2014 Recreational diving services - Requirements for the training of recreational scuba divers - Part 2: Level 2 - Autonomous diver,&lt;ref name="ISO24801-2"/&gt;
* ISO 11107 – ‘Nitrox diving’
* ISO 24801-3:2014 Recreational diving services - Requirements for the training of recreational scuba divers - Part 3: Level 3 - Dive leader,&lt;ref name="ISO24801-3"/&gt;
*  ISO 24802-1:2014 Recreational diving services - Requirements for the training of scuba instructors - Part 1: Level 1, and ISO 24802-2:2014 Recreational diving services - Requirements for the training of scuba instructors - Part 2: Level 2 &lt;ref&gt;https://www.iso.org/standard/60464.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research into scuba diver safety ==
The non-profit [[Divers Alert Network]] (DAN) was founded at [[Duke University]] in 1980 to promote safe diving.&lt;ref name=BennettBook /&gt;&lt;ref name=DANhx /&gt; and has expanded into a global group of not-for-profit organisations providing safety and insurance services to members and maintaining databases on diving accidents. They publish research results and collaborate with other organizations on projects of common interest, mostly regarding scuba diving safety.&lt;ref name="DAN E projects" /&gt;

Project Stickybeak was a privately run collation of data on diving fatalities in the Asia Pacific region run by Douglas Walker for several years, with annual reports on fatality statistics.&lt;ref name="Walker 2006" /&gt; In 2007 Project Stickybeak was incorporated into the DAN Asia-Pacific data collection and dive accident reporting project.&lt;ref name="Lippman 2007" /&gt;

The British Sub-Aqua Club publishes an annual report of diving incidents.&lt;ref name="Garrod and Gossling 2008" /&gt;

=== Military diving ===
{{see also|Frogman#History}}
[[File:" 10 - ITALY - Gamma-della-X.gif| thumb|Italian [[World War II]] frogman of "Gruppo Gamma"]]
[[File:British navy frogman.jpg|thumb|A 1945 British navy frogman with complete gear, including the [[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus|Davis apparatus]], a [[rebreather]] originally conceived in 1910 by [[Robert Davis (inventor)|Robert Davis]] as an emergency submarine escape set.]]
[[File:US Navy 050505-N-3093M-001 A member of SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two (SDVT-2) climbs aboard one of the team's SEAL Delivery Vehicles (SDV) before launching from the back of the Los Angeles-class attack submarine USS Philadelph.jpg|thumb|A SEAL Delivery Team member climbs aboard a delivery vehicle before launching from the back of the submarine USS ''Philadelphia''.]]

The first modern military scuba divers were the World War II [[Italian commando frogmen]], of ''[[Decima Flottiglia MAS]]'' (now "ComSubIn": [[Comando Raggruppamento Subacquei e Incursori Teseo Tesei]]) which formed in 1938 and was first in action in 1940. Originally these divers were called "''Uomini Gamma''" because they were members of the top secret special unit called "''Gruppo Gamma''", which originated from the kind of [[Pirelli]] rubber skin-suit&lt;ref name="Rebreathersite" /&gt; nicknamed ''muta gamma'' used by these divers. Later they were nicknamed "''Uomini Rana''", Italian for "frog men"&lt;ref name="Marcante" /&gt; This special corps used an early oxygen [[rebreather]] scuba set, the ''Auto Respiratore ad Ossigeno'' (A.R.O), a development of the [[Drägerwerk|Dräger]] oxygen [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] designed for the mining industry and of the [[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus]] made by Siebe, Gorman &amp; Co and by Bergomi, designed for escaping from sunken submarines.&lt;ref name="Mari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mari 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History flyer" /&gt; The Italian frogmen trained in [[La Spezia]], [[Liguria]], using [[swimfin]]s, rubber [[dry suit]], and the new A.R.O. scuba unit.&lt;ref name="Bianchi" /&gt; After [[Military history of Italy during World War II#Italy enters the war: June 1940|Italy declared war]], the ''[[Decima Flottiglia MAS]]'' (''Xª MAS'') attempted several attacks on British naval bases in the Mediterranean between June 1940 and July 1941, but none was successful, because of equipment failure or early detection by British forces. On September 10, 1941, eight ''Xª MAS'' frogmen were inserted by submarine close to the British harbour at [[Gibraltar]], where using [[human torpedo]]es to penetrate the defences, sank three merchant ships with [[limpet mine]]s before escaping through neutral Spain. An even more successful attack, the [[Raid on Alexandria (1941)|Raid on Alexandria]], was mounted on 19 December on the harbour at [[Alexandria]], again using human torpedoes. The raid resulted in disabling the [[battleship]]s {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} and {{HMS|Valiant|1914|6}} together with a [[destroyer]] and an [[oil tanker]], but all six frogmen were captured.&lt;ref name="O'Hara" /&gt;

The British [[Royal Navy]] had captured an Italian human torpedo during a failed attack on Malta; they developed a copy called the [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariot]] and formed a unit called the [[British commando frogmen|Experimental Submarine Flotilla]], which later merged with the [[Special Boat Service]]. A number of Chariot operations were attempted, most notably Operation Title in October 1942, an attack on the [[German battleship Tirpitz|German battleship ''Tirpitz'']], which had to be abandoned when a storm hit the fishing boat which was towing the Chariots into position.&lt;ref name="Tirpitz" /&gt; The last and most successful British operation resulted in sinking two [[Ocean liner|liner]]s in [[Phuket]] harbour in [[Thailand]] in October 1944.&lt;ref name="Hood 2007" /&gt;

An oxygen rebreather set  called the Lambertsen Amphibious Respirator Unit (LARU) was invented in the United States 1939 by [[Christian Lambertsen]],&lt;ref name=Shapiro2011 /&gt; and was patented in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/about?id=5PRKAAAAEBAJ Lambertsen's patent in ''Google Patents'']&lt;/ref&gt; Lambertsen later renamed it the Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, which, contracted to SCUBA, eventually became the generic term for both open circuit and rebreather autonomous underwater breathing equipment. Lambertson demonstrated it to the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) after being rejected by the U.S. Navy&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com" /&gt;  OSS not only bought into the concept, they hired Dr. Lambertsen to lead the program and build-up the dive element of their maritime unit.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;  The OSS was the predecessor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the maritime element still exists inside their [[Special Activities Division]].&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt;

The [[Shayetet 13]] commandos of the [[Israeli Navy]] have carried out a number of underwater raids on harbors. They were initially trained by veterans of ''Xª MAS'' and used Italian equipment.&lt;ref name="Isseroff" /&gt; As part of [[Operation Raviv]] in 1969, eight frogmen used two human torpedoes to enter Ras Sadat naval base near [[Suez]], where they destroyed two [[motor torpedo boat]]s with mines.&lt;ref name="Gawrych 2000" /&gt;

During the 1982 [[Falklands War]], the [[Servicio de Inteligencia Naval (Argentina)|Argentinian Naval Intelligence Service]] planned an attack on British warships at Gibraltar. Code named [[Operation Algeciras]], three frogmen, recruited from a former anti-government insurgent group, were to plant mines on the ships' hulls. The operation was abandoned when the divers were arrested by Spanish police and deported.&lt;ref name="Algeciras 2011" /&gt;

In 1985, the [[Moruroa#French nuclear weapons testing|French nuclear weapons tests]] at [[Moruroa]] in the Pacific Ocean was being contested by environmental protesters led by the [[Greenpeace]] campaign ship, [[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|''Rainbow Warrior'']]. The [[Action Division]] of the French [[Directorate-General for External Security]] devised a plan to [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|sink the ''Rainbow Warrior'']] while it was berthed in harbor at [[Auckland]] in [[New Zealand]]. Two divers from the Division posed as tourists and attached two limpet mines to the ship's hull; the resulting explosion sank the ship and killed a Netherlands citizen on board. Two agents from the team, but not the divers, were arrested by the [[New Zealand Police]] and later convicted of [[manslaughter]]. The French government finally admitted responsibility two months later.&lt;ref name="UN 1986" /&gt;

In 1989, during the [[Operation Just Cause|U.S. invasion of Panama]], a team of four U.S. Navy SEALs using [[rebreather]]s conducted a combat swimmer attack on the ''Presidente Porras'', a gunboat and yacht belonging to [[Manuel Noriega]]. The commandos attached explosives to the vessel as it was tied to a pier in the [[Panama Canal]], escaping only after being attacked with grenades.&lt;ref name="Hoyt2011" /&gt; Three years later during [[Operation Restore Hope]], members of [[SEAL Team One]] swam to shore in Somalia to measure beach composition, water depth, and shore gradient ahead of a Marine landing.&lt;ref name="Mann2014" /&gt;

=== Cave diving ===
{{see|Cave diving#History}}
The exploration of underwater parts of caves was started using surface supplied equipment before scuba became available.
[[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]], co-inventor of the first commercially successful open circuit [[Scuba set|scuba equipment]], is claimed to have been the world's first open circuit scuba cave diver.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Two regions have had particular influence on cave diving techniques and equipment due to their very different cave diving environments. These are the United Kingdom, and USA, mainly Florida.

==== UK history ====
The number of sites where [[standard diving dress]] could be used is limited and there was little progress before the outbreak of World War II reduced the caving community considerably. The development of underwater warfare made a lot of surplus [[diving equipment|equipment]] available after the war. The [[Cave Diving Group]] re-formed in 1946 and progress was rapid. Typical equipment at this time was a [[frogman]] rubber [[diving suit]] for insulation (water temperature in the UK is typically 4&amp;nbsp;°C), a closed circuit oxygen [[rebreather]] and an "Apparatus For Laying Out Line And Underwater Navigation." The "AFLOLAUN" consisted of lights, [[distance line|line-reel]], [[compass]], notebook (for the survey), batteries, and more.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Progress was typically by "bottom walking", as this was considered less dangerous than swimming in the absence of buoyancy control. The use of oxygen put a depth limit on the dives. This was the normal procedure until approximately 1960 when new techniques using wetsuits and open-circuit scuba sets were introduced. The development of side mounting cylinders, helmet-mounted lights and free-swimming with fins increased accessibility, and the increasing capacity and pressure rating of air cylinders extended dive durations.&lt;ref name="Farr 1991" /&gt;

====US History====
In the 1970s, cave diving greatly increased in popularity among divers in the United States. However, there were very few experienced cave divers and almost no formal classes to handle the surge in interest. The result was a large number of divers trying to cave dive without any formal training. This resulted in more than 100 fatalities over the course of the decade. The state of Florida came close to banning SCUBA diving around the cave entrances. The cave diving organizations responded to the problem by creating training programs and certifying instructors, in addition to other measures to try to prevent these fatalities. This included posting signs, adding no-lights rules, and other enforcements.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The cave diving pioneer [[Sheck Exley]] explored many underwater cave systems in Florida, and elsewhere in the US and the rest of the world. On 6 February 1974, Exley became the first chairman of the Cave Diving Section of the [[National Speleological Society]].&lt;ref name="Cave diving section" /&gt;

Since the 1980s, cave diving education has greatly reduced diver fatalities, and it is now uncommon for a certified cave diver to die in an underwater cave. Also in the 1980s, refinements were made to the equipment used for cave diving, most importantly better lights with smaller batteries. In the 1990s, cave diving equipment configurations became more standardized, due mostly to the adaptation and popularization of the backplate and wing based "Hogarthian Rig", developed in North Florida, which keeps equipment configurations simple and streamlined.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Documentary films made by [[Wesley C. Skiles]] and [[Jill Heinerth]] have contributed to the increasing popularity of cave diving in the early 21st century.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

=== Diving on shipwrecks and other sunken structures ===
{{see|Wreck diving}}
Wreck diving is [[recreational diving]] where the [[shipwreck|wreckage of ships]], aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to [[Sinking ships for wreck diving sites|scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites]]. Diving to [[Aviation archaeology#Underwater surveying and recovery|crashed aircraft]] can also be considered wreck diving.&lt;ref name=CHAA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chaa-recovery.ca/content/view/49/50/ |title=Canadian Harvard Aircraft Association Dive Recovery Team |year=2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613130546/http://chaa-recovery.ca/content/view/49/50/ |archivedate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom, and the perpose is for the entertainment of the diver.

Some wreck diving involves [[Penetration diving|penetration]] of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The scientific discipline of [[underwater archaeology]] also involves diving on shipwrecks, but in this field the intention is to collect data or preserve artifacts.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Marine salvage]] is the recovery of artifacts and material from shipwrecks and other underwater sites, for commercial reasons or because the artifacts or materials are perceived as having monetary or personal value other than scientific or historical. Commercial marine salvage may be restricted to the use of surface supplied diving equipment in some jurisdictions, but work is also done using scuba.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Plot==
Joe is framed by gamblers who hope to fix the outcome of an upcoming boxing match. When Joe manages to clear his name, the gamblers frame the scrupulously honest boxer with murder. On the run from the law, Joe is forced to turn gumshoe and solve the murder himself—and he'd better hurry if he's going to get to the Big Fight on time.&lt;ref name="allmovie1"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
''[[TV Guide]]'' noted a "better-than-average "Joe Palooka" film...Making the most of realistic dialog, director Cyril Endfield moves the film along at a nice pace while holding together a number of plot lines. Surprisingly, there isn't much boxing footage in this one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/joe-palooka-in-the-big-fight/review/102783 |title=Joe Palooka In The Big Fight Review |publisher=Movies.tvguide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium''' (Spanish: ''Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel'') is a [[soccer-specific stadium]] located in [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico]]. It is best known as the former home of the [[Puerto Rico Islanders]] of the [[North American Soccer League]] and current home of the [[Puerto Rico FC]] of the [[North American Soccer League]]. The stadium can seat up to 22,000 people. It has easy access the metro station known as "Deportivo Station."

==History==

Created in 1973 as a [[baseball]] stadium with a capacity of 12,500, it was home to the [[Vaqueros de Bayamón (baseball)|Vaqueros de Bayamón]] up until 2003 when the team became defunct.

===La Meca of Puerto Rican Football===
In 2003 with the Vaqueros folding, the stadium seemed doomed to be relegated to a youth stadium or to demolition, but late that same year the stadium was reborn and was to be home for another professional club. However, this time it would be as an [[association football]] stadium. It had been chosen by the [[Puerto Rico Islanders]] as their new home. Its "''L''" shaped stands were not suited for the sport and it originally had an awkward feel to it since the stand behind the goal angles away from the pitch. This has led most of the fans to prefer to sit in the part of the stands that run parallel to the pitch. 

Over the period that it has hosted the sport of [[soccer]] it has created an atmosphere that is unique to the stadium and the Islanders. 

It has played host to the resurgence of association football in Puerto Rico and has been given the nickname "La Meca" because it has been a key player in the sport's rise to popularity in the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanjuancapital.com/noticiasread.asp?r=53866ISB4A |title=Reconocen pioneros Islanders |publisher=Municipality of San Juan |language=Spanish |date=2006-06-19 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020953/http://www.sanjuancapital.com/noticiasread.asp?r=53866ISB4A |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also called "JRL" by fans as an abbreviation of its official name. Another name that has been used for the stadium is "La Islandera" since it was the home of the Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.prislandersfc.com/index/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=68| title=Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel - Bayamón, Puerto Rico | publisher=Puerto Rico Islanders| language=Spanish| date=2008-08-23| accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was home to [[Bayamon FC]], a professional football team in the [[Puerto Rico Soccer League]] now playing in the [[Bayamon Soccer Complex]], And Sevilla Bayamon FC, now called [[Sevilla FC Puerto Rico|Sevilla-FC Juncos]], they moved to [[Juncos, Puerto Rico|Juncos]].

It has also played host to the [[CFU Club Championship]] Group C in 2006, where the Islanders played but lost to [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[W Connection]] 0-1 and the [[Puerto Rico MLS-USL Challenge]] in 2007, and two [[2010 World Cup]] qualifying matches against the [[Dominican Republic national football team|Dominican Republic]] and [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]].

====Renovation in 2012====
The renovations to the stadium have been made to upgrade a stadium created for baseball to be soccer-specific. The stadium will also have new dressing rooms and bathrooms and the replacement of some seating. There will also be some temporary bleachers until the addition for new seating is completed later. Lighting has also been adjusted to be more uniform across the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidemnsoccer.com/2012/07/26/first-stage-of-renovations-for-juan-ramon-loubriel-stadium-close-to-complete/|title=First Stage of Renovations for Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium Close to Complete|publisher=IM Soccer News|date=July 26, 2012|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remodeling of the stadium will be done in several stages, with a total cost of $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thesportpress.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1647:remodelaci%C3%B3n-millonaria-al-juan-ram%C3%B3n-loubriel&amp;Itemid=123| title=Remodelacion millonaria - Bayamón, Puerto Rico | publisher=The sport press| language=Spanish| date=2012-02-04| accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Panoramic Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium.jpg|400px|thumb|left|A view of the stadium in 2012 after the first phase of renovation.]]

===A new team, a new home (2015-2017)===
In 2015, it was announced home to [[Puerto Rico FC]] of the [[North American Soccer League]]. The team will begin play in the [[2016 North American Soccer League season]] of Fall season.

===Hurricane damage to the stadium (2017)===
On September 22, 2017, the stadium was severely damaged by [[Hurricane Maria]], which led to cancellations of the games and forcing [[Puerto Rico FC]] to play the next same matches in neutral venues, leaving the stadium with complete uncertainty for future matches until fixes are made.

==Events==
The first boxing bout between [[Alfredo Escalera]] and [[Alexis Argüello]] dubbed [[The Bloody Battle of Bayamon]], took place at the stadium on January 28, 1978.

In September 26, 1992 the heavy metal band Iron Maiden played on their Fear of the Dark Tour. First time Iron Maiden visit Puerto Rico.
 
The popstar [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] performed a sold out concert at the stadium on October 26, 1993 during [[The Girlie Show World Tour]].

The rock band [[Aerosmith]] performed in here on January 28, 1994 during their [[Get a Grip Tour]].

==Early life==
Stevenson was born in 1930 in [[Los Angeles, California]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slotnik|first1=Daniel E.|title=Larry Stevenson, Innovative Skateboard Designer, Is Dead at 81|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/27/sports/larry-stevenson-skateboard-designer-dies-at-81.html|accessdate=17 October 2017|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; his mother was Inez Kiem and his father was Leonard Stevenson. After high school Larry Stevenson joined the U.S. Navy as a fighter mechanic. He served for two years in the [[Korean War]].

After that, he went on to [[Santa Monica College]] in California and became a swimmer.  He played water polo and swam for Coach John Josephs.  Stevenson won the all American award for fastest time for the breast stroke.  The record was only recently{{When|date=November 2010}} broken, and he was given a lifetime allowance into any Santa Monica College event, if he wished to attend. After SMC, Stevenson went to USC, on a swimming scholarship, where he majored in business.

During the middle to late part of the 1950s, Stevenson became a Venice Beach lifeguard for the city of Los Angeles.  While sitting watching surfers he noticed they would skate on crude skateboards back in the parking lots at the beach. This was true especially when there was no surf.  Stevenson, while visiting Hawaii en route to Korea, during the war noticed a great surfing beach called "Makaha".  All those years later he remembered how much he liked the beach in Hawaii, but he also loved the name Makaha.

After a short period of time, Stevenson started MAKAHA skateboards.  He is credited with being the man who made the first high-quality skateboard. He patented the double kicktail in 1969, had the first skate team in 1963, and held the first skateboard contest in 1963.&lt;ref name="Rompella2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rompella|first=Natalie|title=Famous firsts: the trendsetters, groundbreakers &amp; risk-takers who got America moving!|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bc-_uWnoZWwC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=21 October 2010|year=2007|publisher=Lobster Press|isbn=978-1-897073-55-1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stevenson also published ''Surfguide'' magazine during the 1960s, and [[Poweredge Magazine|Poweredge]] skateboarding magazine during the 1980s and 1990s. He was involved with Makaha and ''Poweredge''; both have been reborn with new editors.

==Death==
Stevenson died on March 25, 2012 from complications of pneumonia due to Parkinson's disease in his Santa Monica home.

'''Lee Cooper Brand''' is an English [[clothing]] company, operating worldwide, that licenses the sale of many '''Lee Cooper'''-branded items, including [[denim]] [[jeans]]. The head office is located in [[London]], [[England]]. The company originally produced workwear for export, and began to specialise in denim jackets and trousers in the 1930s.

In 2013, [[Iconix Brand Group]] acquired Lee Cooper from [[Sun Capital Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altassets.net/private-equity-news/by-news-type/deal-news/sun-european-partners-sells-lee-cooper-for-72m.html Sun European Partners sells Lee Cooper for $72m]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early years===
The brand that eventually became Lee Cooper was established in 1908 by Morris Cooper and a friend, Louis Maister, after they arrived in London from their hometown in [[Lithuania]] (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]), having previously spent some time in [[South Africa]]. Operating under the name M. Cooper (Overalls) Ltd., from premises on Middlesex Street in London's [[East End]], they began production of workwear, having identified a market for it in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leecooper.com/history1.php |title=Lee Cooper |publisher=Leecooper.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years of the [[First World War]], M. Cooper (Overalls), which by then employed over 600 people, halted production of workwear and began making uniforms, kit bags and rucksacks for the [[British Army]]. In 1937, a new factory dedicated to the manufacture of denim was opened in Stratford, with the business reporting a profit of £1,000 by year end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article5132618.ece |title=Times Harold Cooper obituary |publisher=Timesonline.com |date= 2008-11-12|accessdate=2010-08-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939 led Morris Cooper to split the business into two: one arm continued making workwear, while the other concentrated on producing military uniforms, battle fatigues and flight overalls. M. Cooper (Overalls) eventually became one of the biggest suppliers to [[Her Majesty's Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leecooper.com/history3.php |title=Lee Cooper |publisher=Leecooper.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war===

Morris Cooper died in 1940 and his son, Harold Cooper, took over the business upon his return from active service in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]. He set about modernising the company and building on its wartime success, switching focus to casual wear and denim production, and taking advantage of the introduction of clothes rationing to increase competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article5132618.ece |title=Times Harold Cooper obituary |publisher=Timesonline.com |date= 2008-11-12|accessdate=2010-08-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a re-branding strategy, the company was rechristened, with Harold adding a version of his wife's family name, Leigh, to his own to create "Lee Cooper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leecooper.com/history4.php |title=Lee Cooper |publisher=Leecooper.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee Cooper jeans were adopted by the youth counterculture of the 1950s and 1960s and Harold capitalised on this association by sponsoring a [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] tour and working with [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and [[Jane Birkin]]. The company caused a degree of moral outrage in 1953 by introducing the zip-front to women's jeans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/views/obituaries/2008/11/13/harold-cooper-64375-22245380/ |title=Liverpool Daily Post Harold Cooper obituary |publisher=Liverpooldailypost.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned a series of bold publicity campaigns, some of them incorporating fictitious designers such as the Italian 'Alfredo Angelous' in order to appeal to subcultures such as the [[Mod (subculture)|Mods]], who favoured continental style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article5132618.ece |title=Times Harold Cooper obituary |publisher=Timesonline.com |date= 2008-11-12|accessdate=2010-08-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 1970s saw expansion of production, with the company opening factories in Ireland, France and Tunisia and by the mid 1980s these facilities were producing between 40,000 and 45,000 garments per week. During this time, annual turnover grew to more than £100 million. Lee Cooper was also one of the main pitchside sponsors at [[UEFA Euro 1984|the 1984 European Championships]] in France.

In 1989, the Cooper family sold their majority stake in the business and since then Lee Cooper has become a 'lifestyle' brand, operating in more than seventy markets across the world. In 2008, the company celebrated its [[centenary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article5132618.ece |title=Times Harold Cooper obituary |publisher=Timesonline.com |date= 2008-11-12|accessdate=2010-08-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pavilhão da Luz Nº 1''', known as '''Pavilhão Fidelidade''' for sponsorship reasons, is the main [[indoor arena|arena]] of Portuguese multi-sport club [[S.L. Benfica]]. It has a capacity of 2,400 seats and it is mainly used by the [[S.L. Benfica (basketball)|basketball]], [[S.L. Benfica (futsal)|futsal]] and [[S.L. Benfica (roller hockey)|roller hockey]] departments of the club.

Built at the same time as the new [[Estádio da Luz]], it was designed from the start to replace the 37-year old Pavilhão da Luz, which was torn down in March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seara Cardoso abre "caixinha" da nova Luz|trans-title=Seara Cardoso opens "little box" of the new Luz|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/benfica/detalhe/seara-cardoso-abre-caixinha-da-nova-luz.html|access-date=21 March 2016|work=Record.pt|date=4 December 2002|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Últimas emoções no Pavilhão da Luz|trans-title=Last thrills in Pavilhão da Luz|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/modalidades/hoquei-em-patins/detalhe/ultimas-emocoes-no-pavilhao-da-luz.html|access-date=21 March 2016|work=Record|date=15 March 2003|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opened on 28 February 2004, during the celebrations of the club centenary, its first game opposed the basketball section against [[Ovarense Basquetebol|Ovarense]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite news|title=A catedral das modalidades|trans-title=The cathedral of sports|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/benfica/detalhe/a-catedral-das-modalidades.html|access-date=21 March 2016|work=Record|date=28 February 2004|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its features include a [[NBA]]-style scoreboard, and other standard amenities like safety nets behind the goals, [[press box]]es, five [[changing room|locker rooms]], bars, medical offices and accommodation to handicapped fans.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; Eight months after its opening, Benfica sold the arena [[naming rights]] to [[Banif Financial Group|Açoreana Seguros]] for a fee rumoured to be close to €1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Açoreana Seguros dá nome ao pavilhão|trans-title=Açoreana Seguros gets naming rights|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/benfica/detalhe/acoreana-seguros-da-nome-ao-pavilhao.html|access-date=21 March 2016|work=Record|date=7 October 2004|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Positive-pressure biosafety suit.jpg|thumb|220px|right|A [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] laboratorian dons an older-model PPPS before entering a Maximum Containment lab, or “suit lab”.]]

'''Positive pressure personnel suits''' ('''PPPS''') — or '''positive pressure protective suits''', informally known as "'''space suits'''", "'''moon suits'''", "'''blue suits'''", etc. — are highly specialized, totally encapsulating, industrial protection garments worn only within special [[biocontainment]] or maximum containment ([[Biosafety level|BSL-4]]) laboratory facilities. These facilities research [[Biological agents|dangerous pathogens]] which are highly infectious and may have no treatments or vaccines available. These facilities also feature other special equipment and procedures such as [[airlock]] entry, quick-drench disinfectant showers, special waste disposal systems, and shower exits.

The PPPS is a sophisticated variety of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE), a type of  [[hazmat suit]], which is air-tight and designed for [[positive pressure]] to prevent contamination to the wearer even if the suit becomes damaged. BSL-4 cabinets and "Suit Laboratories" have special engineering and design features to prevent hazardous microorganisms from being disseminated into the outside environment.  These [[biosafety suites]], where PPPSs are used, are suites of laboratory rooms which are essentially equivalent to large Class III [[biosafety cabinet]]s in which the interiors of the PPPSs serve as the "outside" environment for workers. Examples include the biocontainment suites at the [[U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] (USAMRIID) at [[Fort Detrick, Maryland]] and the [[Maximum Containment Facility]] (MCF) of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

==Operation==
[[File:NIAID Integrated Research Facility - Positive Pressure Personnel Suit Inspection.jpg|thumb|Regular inspection of PPPS to locate any punctures or leaks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seligson|first1=Susan|title=Video Offers Glimpse of Biosafety Level 4 Lab Science webcast "threads the NEIDL"|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2013/video-offers-glimpse-of-biosafety-level-4-lab/|website=BU Today|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Fresh, filtered air is typically supplied to the interior of a PPPS via overhead tubing. In addition to the physical barrier provided, the positive pressurization offers additional protection in the event of exposure through a defect or puncture in the suit, for if the suit’s integrity is compromised, air will be forced out instead of being sucked in. Extensive training with the PPPS is required to safely pursue research in a PPPS within a biosafety facility.

In 1987, USAMRIID scientist Joel Dalrymple described the subjective experience of working in a PPPS and "his solemn respect for working in the hot suits" to a journalist:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I don't want anyone to prep my suit," he says. "It is like packing your own parachute." Indeed, it is no picnic to do experiments weighted down with all that gear and paraphernalia. The air hisses so loudly you have to crimp the air supply to talk to your lab partner. The plastic eyeshield reflects the lightbulbs in the ceiling. Heat builds up. Fatigue sets in. You can't scratch or go to the bathroom. And all the time, there is the danger that you will slip and puncture your suit and infect yourself. After working in the hot suite, everyone showers and checks the suit, just to make sure that no tiny punctures turn up. "It's just instinct," says Dalrymple. "You come out, pull off your glove, blow it up and hold it. You've been working with needles all day. It is refreshing to see a glove that remains inflated."&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, Jeanne (1987), ''The Killing Winds: The Menace of Biological Warfare''; [[New York City|New York]]; [[Arbor House]], pp 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
In the late 1970s, [[ILC Dover]], LP, developed a special garment, the [[Demilitarization Protective Ensemble]] (DPE), to fulfill the [[U.S. Army]]’s need for an off-the-shelf, positive pressure, totally encapsulating suit for use by maintenance personnel at a [[chemical weapon]]s site.  The DPE was delivered to the Army in 1979 and is still currently in daily use, with over 700 recorded entries into a "hot" environment and a perfect safety record. From the technology used in production of the DPE, ILC developed a PPPS to be used for commercial applications. Delta Protection, a subsidiary of French company Bacou-Dalloz, designed a [[Michelin Man]]-inspired suit in 2003, known in the United States at that time as French BSL 4 Suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masibay|first1=Kimberly|title=A Chic French Import Attracts U.S. Attention|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2003-05/hot-zone-couture|accessdate=5 December 2014|work=Popular Science|date=27 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, the CDC purchased 30 Delta Protection suits to be used in BSL-4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=84 -- BSL-4 Protective Suit: Solicitation Number: Reference-Number-00HCVHDB-2007-45398|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3f464234e94bae197063f2477caa0c8e&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0|website=CDC|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called them "orange suits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHIL # 10727|url=http://phil.cdc.gov/phil/details.asp?pid=10727|website=CDC|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHIL # 10724|url=http://phil.cdc.gov/phil/details.asp?pid=10724|website=CDC|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 20, 2007, Bacou-Dalloz became [[Sperian Protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley Personal Protection History|url=https://stanleypersonalprotection.com/History|website=Stanley|accessdate=5 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209164200/https://stanleypersonalprotection.com/History#|archive-date=2014-12-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same suit design became part of Sperian Protection ventilated suits ("White Suits").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solutions to Protect People Against Particles|url=http://www.nanosafe.org/home/liblocal/docs/2008_Oral%20presentations/O5-5_Sperian%20Protection.pdf|website=NanoSafe|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 15, 2010, Sperian Protection became part of [[Honeywell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sperian Protection, Historical Player|url=http://www.sperian.com/The_Group/History.aspx|website=Sperian Protection|accessdate=5 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211231854/http://www.sperian.com/The_Group/History.aspx|archivedate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product is now called Honeywell BSL 4 suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Product Family BSL 4|url=http://www.honeywellsafety.com/Products/Protective_Clothing/BSL_4.aspx?site=/americas|website=Honeywell|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chemturion series is a series of multi-use, totally encapsulating PPPSs, currently used by [[Health Canada|Public Health Canada]], [[Boston University]], [[AI Signal Research]], USAMRIID, the CDC, and many industrial companies such as [[DuPont]], [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow]], and [[Georgia Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency, [http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?docid=003676566 Suiting up for Safety, Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923204937/http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?docid=003676566 |date=2015-09-23 }}.

==In fiction and film==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
PPPSs — along with many less elaborate types of hazmat suit — have long been a staple of the [[science fiction]] and [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] genres, where they are used to accentuate the drama of [[biohazard]] scenarios. Common dramatic (and generally unrealistic) situations involve a suit failure leading to rapid death in films such as ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]'' (1995). The wearing of a PPPS can underscore the villainy and "otherness" of movie bad guys as in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982).  A recent, more sedate, example of PPPSs in a film is the [[Steven Soderbergh]] movie ''[[Contagion (film)|Contagion]]'' (2011). 

In the ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'' series of [[Video game|video games]], several types of aliens use variants of PPPSs, most notably the character Tali, who suffers from a compromised [[immune system]]. In [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]]'s comic ''Edena'', the residents of the Nest City wear similar suits at all times to protect themselves from diseases, as do the denizens of Javecek in Carla Speed McNeill's comic ''[[Finder (comics)|Finder]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edena|last=Giraud|first=Jean|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finder: Third World|last=McNeill|first=Carla|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bethesda's ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' games'','' the Hazmat Suit is an armor item which can be equipped on a character to prevent [[radiation]] damage.

Frank Herbert's novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' also features a group of people who wear elaborate gear known as "stillsuits"; however, these are built to maximize water retention in a desert environment and not as a barrier against [[Pathogen|pathogens]] or chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dune|last=Herbert|first=Frank|publisher=Ace Books|year=1965|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prince George's Stadium''' is a multipurpose sports venue located in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], near [[Bowie, Maryland|Bowie]],&lt;ref name=BowieMap&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cityofbowie.org/DocumentCenter/View/6847/Bowie-Neighborhoods-Map |title=Bowie Neighborhoods |website=[[Bowie, Maryland|City of Bowie]] |access-date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pgparks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pgparks.com/Facilities/Facility/Details/Prince-Georges-Stadium-85 |title=Prince George's Stadium |website=Prince George's County Department of Parks and Recreation |access-date=September 2, 2018 |quote=Prince George's Stadium 4101 Northeast Crain Highway Bowie, MD 20715}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily used for [[baseball]]. It is home of the [[Baltimore Orioles]]' [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] affiliate in the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]], the [[Bowie Baysox]]. The stadium is the result of a cooperative venture between Maryland Baseball Limited Partnership and the [[Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission]], and is built on park property.&lt;ref name="pgparks" /&gt;

==History==
The stadium opened June 16, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Two Months Late, It's 'Play Ball!' Time in Bowie|first=David|last=Montgomery|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 2, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its capacity for baseball is listed at 10,000, but when the Double-A All-Star Game was held there in [[2000 in sports|2000]], the attendance was about 14,000. The 2002 [[Major League Lacrosse All-Star Game]] was held at the stadium.

While the stadium was being finished, the Baysox played one full season (1993) at Baltimore's [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] and a few series in 1994 at fields belonging to the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis]], and the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], as well as the minor league stadiums of the [[Frederick Keys]] and [[Wilmington Blue Rocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ultimate Minor League Baseball Road Trip: A Fan's Guide to AAA, AA, A, and Independent League Stadiums|first=Joshua|last=Pahigian|year=2007|publisher=The Lyons Press|isbn=978-1-59921-024-7|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenants==
Prince George's Stadium is located near the intersection of [[U.S. Route 301 (Maryland)|U.S. Route 301]] and [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|U.S. Route 50]]. It has been host to the AA All-Star Game twice, the [[United States Congressional Baseball Game]], the annual [[Allen Iverson]] charity softball game, a lacrosse tournament, the USA Softball team, yard sales, movie nights, concerts, and Halloween activities in addition to its primary function as a baseball park. In addition, the Baysox operate a [[drive-in theater]] in the stadium's left-field parking lot during the Baysox' road trips.

Due to its close proximity to several local military bases including [[Fort George G. Meade]] and [[Andrews Air Force Base]], the stadium is also regularly the site of related promotions involving enlisted persons. For example, on June 14, 2007, 5,000 Baysox tickets were distributed to soldiers to celebrate Flag Day with professional wrestler [[Sergeant Slaughter]].

In 1998, the stadium hosted the Bowie Nationals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Kent|title=Fall league opener draws 1,118, but Kirk 'very encouraged' CEO cites rain, promotion|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-23/sports/1998266019_1_shawn-gallagher-tike-redman-bowie|accessdate=May 17, 2016|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; a team in the single-season [[Maryland Fall Baseball]] league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoffmann|first1=John|title=Keys finish first half on a tear; Fall League to fold|url=http://www.gazette.net/gazette_archive/1999/199926/thurmont/sports/a40700-1.html|accessdate=May 17, 2016|work=[[The Gazette (Maryland)|The Gazette]]|date=June 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, it served as the home of the [[D.C. Forward]], the [[Pro Cricket]] team for Washington, D.C.

==Appearances==
Prince George's Stadium was featured in the January 30, 2007 episode ("Well Digger") of the Discovery Channel series ''[[Dirty Jobs]]'', where host [[Mike Rowe (television host)|Mike Rowe]] performed a variety of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Closing Bell, January 30, 2007|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Closing-Bell/2007/01/30/Closing-Bell-January-30-2007.aspx|work=[[Sports Business Daily]]|date=January 30, 2007|accessdate=August 21, 2011|quote=The Double-A Eastern League Bowie Baysox, an Orioles affiliate, will be featured on Discovery Channel's "Dirty Jobs" at 9:00pm ET, as host Mike Rowe will be seen washing uniforms, cleaning shoes and mowing the outfield grass at Prince George's Stadium.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vegpro''' is a [[Kenya]]n [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Naivasha]]. They currently compete in the [[Kenyan National Super League]], the second tier of Kenyan football. They play their home games at the [[Naivasha Stadium]].

The club was founded in 1994 as '''Sher Agencies Football Club'''. In 2002 it played in the [[Nationwide League (Kenya)|Nationwide League]] and won promotion to the Premier League with the help of two notable names: Anthony Wekesa and Jacob Abu Omondi who were the force behind their promotion.

The club was formerly owned by Sher Karuturi Limited, the largest flower producer in Kenya, a subsidiary of Karuturi Global Limited, an Indian company. The company is a producer of cut roses with an area of over 200 hectares under Greenhouse cultivation and an annual production capacity of around 500 million stems. Until November 2014, the club was known as '''Karuturi Sports Club''', when the club was taken over by a multinational fresh produce, flowers and logistics company known as the VP Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futaa.com/football/article/former-kpl-side-rebrands |title=Former KPL side rebrands |author=Wilson Mathu |publisher=Futaa.com |date=15 October 2014 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Welsh Handball''' ({{lang-cy|'''Pêl-Law'''}}) is one of the most ancient [[Sport in Wales#Traditional and native sports|native sports]] of [[Wales]]. It is related to coeval sports such as [[Irish handball]], [[fives]], [[Basque pelota]] and is a possible antecedent of [[American handball]]. The sport has been continually attested since the Middle Ages and its popularity saw it become an important expression of [[Welsh culture]], offering ordinary people opportunities through prize-money, bookkeeping and even player professionalism.

Due to its cultural significance games of Pêl-law were simply referred to as ''Chwarae Pêl'' (playing ball) and it has since been described as ''"Wales’s first national sport"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Dicks|first1= Kevin|title= Handball. The Story of Wales’ First National Sport|date=2016|publisher=Y Lolfa|location=Wales|edition=1st|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and scoring==
Pêl-law shares many rules and its methods of scoring with other handball games, as well as [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[racquetball]]. A hard, leather-cased ball (a [[Spaldeen]] is often used today) is struck with the palm against a front wall. The objective is to keep the ball out of the opponent's reach but inside the bounds of play so that they are unable to return. Points are only awarded for the serving player.

Scores are marked on the front wall using the traditional "box" scoring system, and formal matches are overseen by an official score marker and one referee. Whilst historically the rules varied from village to village, the scoring method remained constant and is still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK's Only Purpose-built Handball Court|url=http://heritageofwalesnews.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/uks-only-purpose-built-handball-court.html|website=Heritage of Wales News|publisher=blogspot.co.uk|language=Welsh and English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early development===
Similar games to Pêl-law have been played throughout the world for thousands of years. Handball-like games have originated in several places at different times. [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Hieroglyph]]s in the temple of [[Osiris]] in Egypt portray priests taking part in a game very similar to handball. The Civilisations of [[South America|South]] and Central America had a [[Mesoamerican ballgame|handball-like game]], which was a large part of [[pre-Columbian]] culture. It is likely that the Welsh game has a similarly ancient origin.

Pêl-law has been attested in the [[Medieval Welsh literature|literature of Wales]] since the Middle Ages, and was mentioned by [[Nennius]] in the ninth century. There is evidence that the game was played at [[Tintern Abbey]] and [[Raglan Castle]] once held a Pêl-law court inside its Great Hall of State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dicks|first1=Kevin|title=Handball – The Story of Wales’ First National Sport|date=2017|publisher=Y Lolfa|isbn=9781784613761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance to Welsh culture===
By [[Tudor times]], most sports in Wales were banned by order of the [[English Crown]]. Sports were banned for a number of reasons, but in Wales they were particularly seen as a distraction from the practice of [[archery]] as [[English Longbow|Welsh longbowmen]] were integral to the defence of the [[Kingdom of England|kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/21h.416/www/militarytechnology/longbow.html |accessdate=18 Aug 2013 |title=Engineering the Medieval Achievement - The Longbow |author= Prof. Anne McCants |website=web.mit.edu |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banned sports were also seen as encouraging gambling, violence and debauchery with only Christmas (and later Easter) seeing the ban relaxed. As sports enjoyed by the English nobility (such as [[jousting]], [[bear-baiting]] and [[cock-fighting]]) continued with no such restrictions, the outlawed sports came to be seen as an expression of protest against the landowning class. This social context was exacerbated as authorities continued to characterise pêl-law games as havens of mob behavior, sedition and ultimately revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trueman|first1=CN|title=Tudor Sports And Pastimes|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/tudor-england/tudor-sports-and-pastimes/|website=The History Learning Site|accessdate=17 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Tudor period continued, [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542|laws specific to Wales]] were introduced which removed historic Welsh institutions and barred Welsh people (or English people with Welsh connections) from positions of authority. As such, the surviving Welsh folk-pursuits gained a unique cultural significance to ordinary people. By the fifteenth century pêl-law had great enough social importance and popularity that the contemporary [[bard]] [[Guto'r Glyn]] could allude to it in a [[cywydd]] simply entitled ''Y Bêl'' ({{lang-en|The Ball}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lloyd|first1=Howard|title=The Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorian|date=18 February 1960|publisher=Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion|pages=97–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National sport===
The game was initially played against the side of stone buildings like churches, and the sport's popularity among the Welsh populous drew the ire of both Anglican and Non-conformist leaders, with one Welsh Methodist preacher telling his congregations that handball was among the things which were “taking the country to eternal woe”.

The eighteenth century saw the construction of the first purpose built courts. The new open-backed courts were often built by the owners of public houses to attract trade and the new venues enabled Pêl-law an unprecedented popularity as a spectator sport. However, the new crowds drew more complaints from landowners, who would often refer to the games as '[[Eton fives|fives]]' a very similar game played by English grammar schools. In 1744 a Joanna Lond of Swansea was accused of: ''"maintaining a certain gaming house for a certain unlawful game called fives"'' and a letter written in 1817, states the author’s objection to the transformation of the courtyard of the church at [[Llandaff]] into a ''"Fives court"'', with games interrupting services. It is likely that such instances actually helped the game maintain a distinct attraction. With Welsh language terminology, an archaic scoring system and distinct working-class culture, any vilification by the [[Anglican church]] or local authority appear to have only added to the sport's unique appeal. This era also saw Pêl-law become popular in the west of England.

The late nineteenth century also saw a great number of workers move to Wales and it seems the increasing population enjoyed the sport. [[Irish handball]] was a related working-class sport and it is understood that Irish migrants played the Welsh game, with the construction of the Nelson court in the 1860s possibly built with Irish railway workers in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dicks|first1=Kevin|title=NELSON HANDBALL COURT|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/32811/details/NELSON+HANDBALL+COURT/|website=Royal Commission on the ancient and historical monuments of Wales|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional development===
With Wales' industrial development, and the sport's continued popularity, vast numbers were now able spectate or compete and yet more players became professionals, leading to great rivalries between communities.

One of the first names of national renown was  Richard Edwards ("''champion of every church yard in [[Denbighshire]]''"). Local champions like Billy Newnam of [[Llantrisant]] and the ''"terrible Treharne twins"'' of [[Pontypridd]] also enjoyed widespread fame and adulation. It was common for competitors to travel between villages and towns to challenge the champions of other localities, often for large sums of money.

By the 1870s, Dr Ifor Ajax-Lewis of Llantrisant and Richard Andrews, a miner from [[Nelson, Caerphilly|Nelson]] were offering enormous prize money to any player who could beat them. Andrews, known affectionately as ''‘Dic Ted’'' was particularly admired. Playing throughout the 1870s he played in many famous matches such as that against the 19 year old Peter Price. Peter was another miner at the nearby Taff Bargoed colliery, and their showdown was played in front of an especially large crowd at the Harp Inn in [[Gelligaer]]. Andrews also played against W Jones of [[New Tredegar]] for the then record purse of £20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dicks|first1=Kevin|title=Handball – The Story of Wales’ First National Sport|date=2017|publisher=Y Lolfa|isbn=9781784613761}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Difford|first1=Carl|title=Handball: Wales’ first national sport|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/features/15411358.Handball__Wales____first_national_sport/|website=South Wales Argus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tony Collins|author2=Emma Lile|author3=Annette Walsh|title=Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-35224-X|pages=143–144|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NWu6sLJn7-kC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=welsh+handball+pel-llaw#v=onepage&amp;q=welsh%20handball%20pel-llaw&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and revivals===

Wales endured great economic and cultural changes in the early twentieth century, with the boom [[Edwardian era|Edwardian years]] (which saw the Welsh population grow more than 20%) followed by [[World War I|war]], [[Post–World War I recession|economic uncertainty]] and numerous industrial disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=James O|title=Pêl-law|url=http://www.afinebeginning.com/pel-law/|website=A Fine Beginning|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; This societal turmoil was reflected by a decline in traditional Welsh activities such as Pêl-law, while further advances in transportation made it easier for teams and supporters to travel to the increasingly popular team sports like [[Rugby Union|Rugby]].

[[The Great Depression]] saw a notable revival however, with Pêl-law again becoming popular as an informal and almost costless street game for impoverished workers. The revival was especially prevalent in the [[Swansea]] area, where street versions were a notable feature throughout the city as late as the 1960s.

Another revival began with the formation of the Welsh Handball Association in 1987 to both preserve the Welsh game and coordinate international matches with nations playing similar games to Pêl-law. In 1995 markings for One Wall Handball were made within the three-walled Nelson court and in May that year the inaugural European One Wall Handball Tournament was held in Wales. Attended by representatives from Ireland, England, Belgium and even the USA. The tournament was based at Nelson, with [[Caerphilly]] and [[Bargoed]] also hosting matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Joe|title=The Handball Court at Nelson|journal=The Green Dragon|date=December 1996|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.ballinagree.freeservers.com/handnelson.html|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=Tony|title=The 1995 European One Wall Handball Championships|url=http://www.fivesonline.net/oldefasite/articles/onewall.html|website=fivesonline.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new international competitions saw Welsh success in 1997 when Nelson's Lee Davies (Welsh champion throughout the 1990s) became World Champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=James O|title=Pêl-law|url=http://www.afinebeginning.com/pel-law/|website=A Fine Beginning|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courts==

Local courts were simply known as ''Y Plaen'' (The plain) or ''Plaen Pêl'' (Ball plain) hosted singles and doubles matches and tended to be three walled, but one walled courts were also built. Today many of the surviving courts are unplayable, with possibly the Nelson Court being the only one to be continually maintained.

===The Nelson Court===

The Old Ball Court in [[Nelson, Caerphilly|Nelson]] is a three-sided handball court constructed c.1860. The unique design is based upon the earlier court at the yard of the Nelson Inn. The landlord of the Royal Oak constructed the new court to entice more customers, especially from the Nelson Inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dicks|first1=Kevin|title=NELSON HANDBALL COURT|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/32811/details/NELSON+HANDBALL+COURT/|website=Royal Commission on the ancient and historical monuments of Wales|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court elevated Nelson to a major center for the game with all the great players of their day gracing the court accompanied by large excited crowds and much betting. The Nelson court was also famous for its annual tournaments held between May and August and accompanied by high levels of gambling. The court length was reduced in the 1990s due to safety concerns from the increasing traffic through the village.

In May 1995 the first European Handball Tournament was held at Nelson and was attended by American, Belgian, English, Irish and Welsh teams. Recent notable players include Lee Davies, who was Welsh champion throughout the 1990s and became World Handball Champion in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=James O|title=Pêl-law|url=http://www.afinebeginning.com/pel-law/|website=A Fine Beginning|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eton Fives Yearbook (1994–95) commented, ''“admittedly the weather was excellent, but I would ask you to envisage a court situated right in the middle of a Welsh village, with a local pub literally on the left hand side of the court and a row of terraced houses on the right, and the main road and shops behind. On Finals day you could mingle with the local spectators. We saw the soul of handball in Wales this May. This year the court there became the centre of village life. We saw the game as it was originally devised, a street game, a game of the people.”''

Today, the game remains a unique feature of the village with a seating area built for spectators in 2010.

===Jersey Marine===

Another surviving handball court is Burrows Court in [[Jersey Marine]]. The Court was built in 1864 by brewery owner [[Evan Evans (brewery)|Evan Evans]]. The court features a stone heart set in the highest wall and an inscription which reads ''Gwrol Galon Hyd Angau'' (a brave heart till death). This emblem is that of the 17th Glamorgan Volunteer Rifle Corps and it is thought that the court may have been used as a rifle range for the volunteers’ target practice.

It was here in 1875 that Dr Ivor Ajax-Lewis, the handball champion for Llantrisant, defeated Mr Lovett, the champion of Neath, in a celebrated match with £1,000 in betting stakes.
