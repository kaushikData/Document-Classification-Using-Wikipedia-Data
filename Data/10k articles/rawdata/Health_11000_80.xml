{{DISPLAYTITLE:2015 United States ''E. coli'' outbreak}}
The '''2015 United States ''E. coli'' outbreak''' is an incident in the United States involving the spread of [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]] through contaminated celery which was consumed in chicken salad at various large retailers.&lt;ref name=CDCUpdate&gt;{{cite web|title=Multistate Outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 Infections Linked to Costco Rotisserie Chicken Salad|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2015/o157h7-11-15/|website=CDC: Escherichia Coli|publisher=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/e-coli-scare-spreads-to-walmart-starbucks-target/ar-AAfV8Z1?li=BBnb7Kz|title=E.

== Cases==
Nineteen cases  of ''[[E. coli]]'' were linked to the outbreak, across seven states, primarily in the western half of the United States. Of these reported cases, five resulted in hospitalization, with two patients developing [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]], a type of kidney failure; no deaths occurred as a result of the outbreak.&lt;ref name=CDCUpdate/&gt; This outbreak was therefore the second largest to occur in the U.S. in 2015, behind the far more severe [[Chipotle Mexican Grill#Food safety|Chipotle]] outbreak, which totaled about sixty cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E.coli O26 Infections Linked to Chipotle Mexican Grill (Final Update) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2015/o26-11-15/index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106012040/http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2015/O26-11-15/index.html |archivedate=2015-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations affected==
A total of 19 cases of ''E. coli'' linked to the outbreak were reported, throughout seven states: [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Missouri]], [[Montana]], [[Utah]], [[Virginia]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Recalls of [[Costco]] rotisserie chicken salad, which was deemed the source of the outbreak, occurred throughout the entire United States, with Costco claiming to have removed all infected products by November 20, 2015.&lt;ref name=CDCUpdate/&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
The epidemiologic evidence collected during the outbreak suggested that rotisserie chicken salad made and sold in Costco Wholesale stores in several states was the likely source of the outbreak.&lt;ref name=CDCUpdate/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">The '''Almeric Paget Massage Corps''' (later the '''Almeric Paget Military Massage Corps''') was a British [[physiotherapy]] service during the [[First World War]].

==History==

On the outbreak of the First World War, [[Almeric Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough|Almeric Paget]] and his first wife, the American socialite [[Pauline Payne Whitney]], offered the services of 50 trained [[masseuse]]s to the British [[War Office]].{{sfn|French.|Account of the Almeric Paget Military Massage Corps|p=1}} The offer was accepted and by November 1914, 50 women had been placed in military hospitals.{{sfn|French.|Account of the Almeric Paget Military Massage Corps|p=1}} At this time the demand for physiotherapy (or Massage and Electrical Treatment as it was known) increased and the Pagets were asked to open a day centre in London to relieve pressure on the military hospitals in London.{{sfn|French.|Account of the Almeric Paget Military Massage Corps|p=1}} Lady Alexander Paget offered her house at 55&amp;nbsp;Portland Place and soon over 200 men were being seen at the clinic seen every day.{{sfn|French.|Account of the Almeric Paget Military Massage Corps|p=1}}  By now the number of women employed in the corps was over 200 and soon they became attached to the staff of most military hospitals with a further 120 masseuses employed.{{sfn|French.|Account of the Almeric Paget Military Massage Corps|p=1}}

In 1916 the work of the Corps was favourably inspected by [[Alfred Keogh]], the Director General of the [[Army Medical Services|Army Medical Service]].  This inspection had two direct outcomes.  Firstly the name of the Corps was amended to become the Almeric Paget Military Massage Corps and, secondly, the Corps was asked to manage physiotherapy services in all military hospitals and convalescent camps. As part of the second the services provided would be paid for by a government grant, until then the Corps and the services it provided had been privately funded by the Pagets and by donations.{{sfn|French.|Account of the Almeric Paget Military Massage Corps|p=2}}

Until 1917 all Corps members were UK based but from January 1917 onwards members could volunteer to work overseas and by the end of the war 56 members of the Corps had or were working abroad in Italy and France.{{sfn|Account of the Almeric Paget Military Massage Corps|p=2}}

By the end of the war over 2,000 masseuses and masseurs were at work and just under 3,400 had been engaged by the Corps at some point during the war.{{sfn|Account of the Almeric Paget Military Massage Corps|p=2}}

The Corps came to an end in January 1919 when a formal Military Massage Service was formed under the auspices of the Army and Pensions Massage Association.{{sfn|ACI 65/1919|p=1}}  All members of the Corps were given the option to join the new Service which was controlled jointly by the War Office and the Ministry of Pensions.{{sfn|ACI 65/1919|p=5}}

'''Automatic soap dispensers''' (also known as touchless or no-touch [[soap dispenser]]s) dispense a controlled amount of [[soap]] solution (or a similar liquid such as a [[hand sanitizer]]). They are often used in conjunction with [[automatic faucet]]s in public restrooms. They function to conserve the amount of soap used and stem [[infectious disease]] transmission.

==History==
The idea for the first dispenser was submitted by Guey-Chaun Shiau to be patented in 1989. The [[patent]] was under the name, "Automatic Cleaning-liquid Dispensing Device". The patent was issued in 1991. The patented device was under the following description:
"An automatic cleaning-fluid dispensing device includes: a containing structure for containing cleaning fluid; a sensing device disposed on a base member being installed in the lower portion of said containing structure wherein said base member is provided with an outlet, a sensing circuit disposed on a circuit board, a motor arrangement electrically connected to the sensing circuit, an outlet for passing a light source of the sensing circuit therefrom so as to detect the presence of an external object closing on the light source; and a dispensing mechanism, which is composed of a push structure functionally connected with the driving motor and a pumping structure operatively engaged with the push structure, installed on the base member in connection with the sensing device; whereby when an external object closes to the sensing device, a given amount of the contained cleaning fluid in the containing structure will be automatically supplied for cleaning purposes.".&lt;ref&gt;Huppert, Michael. "Automatic Cleaning-liquid Dispensing Device&amp;nbsp;– {{US Patent|4989755}} {{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4989755/fulltext.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614020714/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4989755/fulltext.html |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
The implementation of automatic washroom supplies has increased dramatically. An increasing number of public locations and private institutions have been incorporating touchless technology into their washrooms.

===Public locations===
Automatic technology has permeated public washrooms. Journalist Michael Sasso once termed it as, "Hygienic Company Brings Space Age to Bathroom." He wrote in reference of the Tampa International Airport. The first automatic urinal was implemented in 1987 and in 16 years, "the airport had 143 automatic urinals, 390 automatic-flush commodes and 276 automatic faucets".&lt;ref&gt;Sasso, Michael. "Hygienic Company Brings Space Age to Bathroom." Knight Ridder Tribune Business News [Washington] 24 Nov. 2003: 1. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Touchless technology has become a regular component of modern washroom facilities.

===Hospital setting===
A study was conducted in the accession area of the clinical microbiology laboratory and the outpatient dentistry department of the University of Virginia Medical Center. Studies were done to evaluate the particular antiseptic solution and the automatic dispensers in a hospital setting. The study was conducted for two months, at the conclusion, the effectiveness of the solution and dispenser was surveyed. Although the particular alcohol antiseptic was disliked because of the skin-drying effect of the alcohol solution, the dispenser itself was recommended for greater use throughout the healthcare facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cronin|first1=WA|last2=Gröschel|first2=DH|title=A no-rinse alcohol antiseptic and a no-touch dispenser for hand decontamination|journal=Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology|volume=10|issue=2|pages=80–3|year=1989|pmid=2926108|doi=10.1086/645967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filth, poverty, disease that permeated nineteenth century’s society was drastically reduced by revolutionary sanitation movements throughout the twentieth century. Although several other advances... can be etiologically and temporally related to some of these diseases, the causal evidence (e.g., temporal sequence, consistency, biologic plausibility) is consistent with the hypothesis that personal hygiene is one other factor that helped to determine the decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Aiello, Allison E. |author2=Elaine L. Larson |author3=Richard Sedlak  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Against Disease: The Impact of Hygiene and Cleanliness on Health|journal= American Journal of Infection Control |volume=36|issue=10|year=2008|pages=S128–151|doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2008.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The advances of hygiene, such as that of the automatic soap dispenser, can be considered as one of the more silent victories of public health and continues to be an important disease prevention strategy, even in this "modern" era when the "gospel of germs" has waned in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomes|first1=N|title=The making of a germ panic, then and now|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=90|issue=2|pages=191–8|year=2000|pmid=10667179|pmc=1446148|doi=10.2105/AJPH.90.2.191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong corollary in the decline of the mortality rate is that of hand-washing (National Center for Health Statistics).

==Mechanisms==
When washing hands, the user’s hands are placed under the nozzle and before the sensor. The activated sensor will further activate a [[pump]] that dispenses a premeasured amount of soap from the nozzle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lenius, Pat|title=Sloan Valve|journal=Supply House Times |volume=47|issue=12|year=2005|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radar-based sensor===
This kind of sensor sends out bursts of [[microwave]] or [[ultrasound]] energy and waits for the energy to reflect back. In a stagnant situation, the energy will bounce back in a normal pattern. When hands are placed in the basin, the energy emitted from the sensor will bounce back irregularly which triggers the dispensation of soap.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, Tom. [http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/household-safety/security/burglar-alarm.htm "How Burglar Alarms Work"] 20 February 2001. HowStuffWorks.com. 11 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sensors used in electronic faucets, electronic flush valves and electronic soap dispensers use Infrared light with wavelength in the range of 850&amp;nbsp;nm. The sensor employs an emitter and a collector. The emitter emits pulses of infrared light while the collector, which is positioned to face in the same direction as the emitter, "sits" dormant waiting to sense the emitted pulses. When no hands are present in front of the device, no reflection of light takes place, and therefore, no pulse is sensed. When hands are present in the path of the emitted light, a portions of the emitted infrared light is bounced back in the direction of the collector which then becomes excited by the light (in the event a photodiode is used) and generates voltage to switch the pump on. If a photo transistor is utilized, then the photo transistor, upon sensing the infrared pulse, will simply switch the pump on.&lt;ref name="MAC Faucets"&gt;Shakkour, Fadi. http://www.macfaucets.com/howitworks&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photo sensor===
This mechanism is composed of two parts, a source of focused light (usually a laser beam) and a light sensor. When the user’s hands are placed in line of the beam of light, the pump mechanism is activated by the disruption that is sensed by the light sensor.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

===Passive infrared sensor===
{{Further|Passive infrared sensor}}

[[Infrared]] sensors detect infrared energy that is emitted by one’s body heat. When hands are placed in the proximity of the sensor, the infrared energy quickly fluctuates. This fluctuation triggers the pump to activate and dispense the designated amount of soap.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

==Advantages==

===Touchless===
The advancement of the automatic soap dispenser further creates an even more sterile environment. When various individuals use the pump, they will leave behind a variety of bacterial colonies. These colonies will interbreed and lead to a more resistant strain of bacteria that can re-contaminate different hands and would not be completely eliminated by the anti-bacterial soap. Wider spectra or higher levels of resistance, in the colonies that are present, are due to interaction and/or complementation between the resistance genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=N.|last2=Angeles|first2=E. R.|last3=Domingo|first3=J.|last4=Magpantay|first4=G.|last5=Singh|first5=S.|last6=Zhang|first6=G.|last7=Kumaravadivel|first7=N.|last8=Bennett|first8=J.|last9=Khush|first9=G. S.|title=Pyramiding of bacterial blight resistance genes in rice: marker-assisted selection using RFLP and PCR|journal=TAG Theoretical and Applied Genetics|volume=95|pages=313–320|year=1997|doi=10.1007/s001220050565|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without having a wide variety of individuals touching the pump, bacterial transmission will be eliminated.

===Preset increments===
Dispensers will only distribute a set amount of soap per motion activation. A predetermined amount to be dispensed can be set to a highly efficient quantity in which waste will be minimal.

===Versatility===
The mechanisms of the dispenser that work for soap may also work for other liquids: soap, hand sanitizer, lotion, laundry detergent etc. The wide range of possibilities extends the use of the dispenser to various other locations other than the bathroom.

==Racial bias==
If a photo sensor-based dispenser is not designed properly, it may only detect a narrow range of skin colors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4800234/Is-soap-dispenser-RACIST.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. CBS. June, 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12658">The '''Bradford Hill criteria''', otherwise known as '''Hill's criteria for causation''', are a group of 9 principles, established in 1965 by the English epidemiologist Sir [[Austin Bradford Hill]]. They can be useful in establishing [[epidemiologist|epidemiologic]] evidence of a [[causal relationship]] between a presumed cause and an observed effect and have been widely used in [[public health]] research. Their exact application and limits of the criteria continue to be debated.

==Definition==
In 1965, the English statistician Sir [[Austin Bradford Hill]] proposed a set of nine criteria to provide [[epidemiologist|epidemiologic]] evidence of a [[causal relationship]] between a presumed cause and an observed effect. (For example, he demonstrated the connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.) The list of the criteria is as follows:&lt;ref name="bh65"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hill |first=Austin Bradford |year=1965 |title=The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation? |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine]] |volume=58 |pages=295–300 |url=http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/hill |pmid=14283879 |pmc=1898525 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Strength''' ([[effect size]]): A small association does not mean that there is not a causal effect, though the larger the association, the more likely that it is causal.
# '''Consistency''' ([[reproducibility]]): Consistent findings observed by different persons in different places with different samples strengthens the likelihood of an effect.
# '''Specificity''': Causation is likely if there is a very specific population at a specific site and disease with no other likely explanation. The more specific an association between a factor and an effect is, the bigger the probability of a causal relationship.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Temporality''': The effect has to occur after the cause (and if there is an expected delay between the cause and expected effect, then the effect must occur after that delay).
# '''Biological gradient''': Greater exposure should generally lead to greater incidence of the effect. However, in some cases, the mere presence of the factor can trigger the effect. In other cases, an inverse proportion is observed: greater exposure leads to lower incidence.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''[[Biological plausibility|Plausibility]]''': A plausible mechanism between cause and effect is helpful (but Hill noted that knowledge of the mechanism is limited by current knowledge).
# '''Coherence''': Coherence between epidemiological and laboratory findings increases the likelihood of an effect. However, Hill noted that "... lack of such [laboratory] evidence cannot nullify the epidemiological effect on associations".
# '''Experiment''': "Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence".
# '''Analogy''': The effect of similar factors may be considered.

==Debate in epidemiology==
Bradford Hill's criteria had been widely accepted as useful guidelines for investigating [[causality]] in [[epidemiological]] studies but their value has been questioned because they have become somewhat outdated. &lt;ref&gt;Schünemann H, Hill S, Guyatt G, et al. "The GRADE approach and Bradford Hill's criteria for causation". Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health 2011; 65:392–95&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, their method of application is debated.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Some proposed options how to apply them include:
# Using a [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] consideration as the basis for applying each criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Höfler M |year=2005|url= http://www.ete-online.com/content/2/1/11 |title= The Bradford Hill considerations on causality: a counterfactual perspective? |journal=[[Emerging themes in epidemiology]] |volume=2 |pages=11 |pmid=16269083 |pmc=1291382 |issue=1 |doi=10.1186/1742-7622-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Subdividing them into three categories: ''direct'', ''mechanistic'' and ''parallel'' evidence, expected to complement each other. This operational reformulation of the criteria has been recently proposed in the context of [[evidence-based medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Howick J, Glasziou P, Aronson JK |year=2009|title= The evolution of evidence hierarchies: what can Bradford Hill's 'guidelines for causation' contribute? |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]] |volume=102 |pages=186–94 |pmid=19417051 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.2009.090020 |issue=5 |pmc=2677430}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Considering [[confounding |confounding factors]] and [[bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glass TA, Goodman SN, Hernán MA, Samet JM |year=2013  |title= Causal inference in public health  |journal=[[Annu Rev Public Health]] |volume=34 |pages=61–75 |pmid= 23297653 |doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031811-124606 |pmc=4079266}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Using Hill’s criteria as a guide, but not considering them to give definitive conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Potischman N, Weed DL |year=1999  |title=Causal criteria in nutritional epidemiology  |journal=[[Am J Clin Nutr]] |volume=69  |issue=6  |pages= 1309S–14S |pmid= 10359231|doi=10.1093/ajcn/69.6.1309S  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Separating causal association and [[health intervention|interventions]], because interventions in public health are more complex than can be evaluated by use of Hill’s criteria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothman KJ, Greenland S |year=2005  |title=Causation and causal inference in epidemiology  |journal=[[Am J Public Health]] |volume= 95 |issue=Suppl 1  |pages=S144–50 |pmid= 16030331 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.059204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An argument against the use of Bradford Hill criteria as exclusive considerations in proving causality is that the basic mechanism of proving causality is not in applying specific criteria&amp;mdash;whether those of Bradford Hill or counterfactual argument&amp;mdash;but in scientific common sense [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Phillips, CV |author2=Goodman KJ |year=2006|url= http://www.ete-online.com/content/3/1/5 |title= Causal criteria and counterfactuals; nothing more (or less) than scientific common sense?|journal=[[Emerging themes in epidemiology]]|volume=3 |page=5 |pmid=16725053 |pmc=1488839 |issue=1 |doi=10.1186/1742-7622-3-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the specific study from which data has been produced is important, and while the Bradford Hill criteria may be applied to test causality in these scenarios, the study type may rule out deducing or inducing causality, and the criteria are only of use in inferring the best explanation of this data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ward, AC |year=2009 |url=http://www.epi-perspectives.com/content/6/1/2 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120908000716/http://www.epi-perspectives.com/content/6/1/2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-08 |title=The role of causal criteria in causal inferences: Bradford Hill's "aspects of association |journal=Epidemiological Perspectives and Innovations |volume=6 |page=2 |pmid=19534788 |issue=1 |doi=10.1186/1742-5573-6-2 |pmc=2706236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate over the scope of application of the criteria includes, whether they can be applied to [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ward, AC |year=2009|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/rp1552833723pt42/ |title=The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation? |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy |volume=12 |pages=333–43 |pmid=19219564 |doi=10.1007/s11019-009-9182-2 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument proposes that there are different motives behind defining causality; the Bradford Hill criteria applied to complex systems such as [[health sciences]] are useful in [[prediction models]] where a consequence is sought; explanation models as to why causation occurred are deduced less easily from Bradford Hill criteria because the instigation of causation, rather than the consequence, is needed for these models.

==Examples of application==
Researchers have applied Hill’s criteria for causality in examining the evidence in several areas of epidemiology, including connections between ultraviolet B radiation, vitamin D and cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Grant WB |year=2009  |title=How strong is the evidence that solar ultraviolet B and vitamin D reduce the risk of cancer?

Since the description of the criteria, many methods to systematically evaluate the evidence supporting a causal relationship have been published, for example the five evidence-grading criteria of the [[World Cancer Research Fund International|World Cancer Research Fund]] (Convincing; Probable; Limited evidence – suggestive; Limited evidence – no conclusion; Substantial effect on risk unlikely).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicr.org/continuous-update-project/What the Continuous Update Conclusions Mean] American Institute for Cancer Research, n.d., retrieved 13 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cecil Byran Jacobson''' (born October 2, 1936) is an American former [[fertility]] doctor who used his own [[spermatozoon|sperm]] to impregnate his patients without informing them.

Jacobson was born in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. A graduate of [[Brown University]] and [[Middlesex University (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Medical School]], he became a researcher at [[George Washington University]], but had no specialist training in infertility medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.highbeam.com/137033/article-1G1-11855808/fertility-doctor-charged-fraud-over-methods "Fertility doctor charged with fraud over methods", ''American Medical News'', February 24, 1992]. Accessed 27 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baboon impregnation==
{{Main article|Male pregnancy#Male pregnancy by ectopic implantation}}
In the 1960s, Jacobson, who was Chief of the Reproductive Genetics Unit at George Washington University Medical School, claimed that he had [[Fertilisation|impregnated]] a male [[baboon]]; he had supposedly planted a fertilized egg from a female baboon into the male's abdominal cavity. He claimed that he had terminated the pregnancy after four months. He never published his results in scientific publications.&lt;ref name=teresi&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/magazine/how-to-get-a-man-pregnant.html | title=How To Get A Man Pregnant | author=Dick Teresi | date=1994-11-27 | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/men_shealth/3354220/Pregnant-men-hard-to-stomach.html | title=Pregnant men: hard to stomach? | author=William Leith | date=2008-04-10 | publisher=''Telegraph''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False pregnancies==
In the 1980s, Jacobson operated a reproductive genetics center in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]]. He specialized in treating women who had difficulty getting pregnant, or problems carrying a pregnancy to term.  One form of treatment was to inject patients, before and after conception, with the hormone [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]] (commonly used as a [[parenteral]] [[fertility medication]] and a [[hormone]] normally released during pregnancy), and patients who had been unable to conceive with other treatments reported success under Jacobson's care.

The pregnancies progressed normally through the early stages: standard pregnancy tests were positive and patients' bodies began to undergo the normal changes.  Jacobson performed [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasounds]], identifying a fetus in the grainy image.  Around the third month, Jacobson would report that the fetus had died. In fact, these patients were never pregnant, and the bodily changes were a reaction to the [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]]. The pregnancy tests were inevitably [[false positive]]s because the tests determined pregnancy by the presence of hCG.  During Jacobson's criminal trial, experts examined the ultrasound photographs, and reported that the purported "fetuses" were actually nearby organs or fecal matter.

Nevertheless, other patients were successful in becoming pregnant and having children.  While some patients were uncomfortable with Jacobson's manner, and began to distrust him, other patients gave him credit for successful treatment. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Paternity==
In 1989, suspicious former patients tipped off a local television station, which investigated and reported on the false pregnancies.  Jacobson was sued by numerous patients.  Federal prosecutors charged Jacobson with perjury (for false testimony during the civil proceedings) and mail and wire fraud (for the use of the letters and the telephone system as part of his fraudulent practice).

During the course of the criminal investigation, another type of fraud came to light.  For a variety of reasons, some patients had arranged to be [[artificial insemination|artificially inseminated]] with sperm provided by screened, anonymous donors arranged by Jacobson.  In order to preserve the anonymity of the donors, Jacobson explained, he identified them in records using code numbers; only Jacobson was to know their true identities.  Investigators found no evidence that any donor program actually existed.  Some of Jacobson's patients who had conceived through donor insemination agreed to genetic testing.  At least seven instances were identified in which Jacobson was the biological father of the patients' children, including one patient who was supposed to have been inseminated with sperm provided by her husband. DNA tests linked Jacobson to at least 15 such children, and it has been suspected that he fathered as many as 75 children by impregnating patients with his own sperm.&lt;ref name="Cecil+Jacobson"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/05/us/doctor-is-found-guilty-in-fertility-case.html | title=Doctor Is Found Guilty in Fertility Case | date=1992-03-11 | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Defense===
Jacobson vigorously denied wrongdoing.  He offered these explanations: With regard to the "false pregnancy" cases, he had believed that the women had actually been pregnant, and continued to maintain that some of them really were pregnant. He was well aware that injected hCG could trigger a false positive on a pregnancy test, but thought that the dosages he administered were too low to have that effect.  If he misread the ultrasound results, that was an honest error.  As for the donor insemination, Jacobson maintained that he had in fact relied on anonymous donors as claimed.  He acknowledged using his own sperm on some occasions, when donors failed to show up when needed, and a patient was about to miss a window of opportunity to become pregnant.  He could not account for the incident in which his own sperm was used in place of the patient's husband's, other than to suggest cross-contamination in the laboratory.

In 1992, Jacobson was convicted of 52 counts of [[mail fraud]], [[wire fraud]] and [[perjury]]. He was sentenced to five years in prison and had his medical license revoked. Jacobson appealed his convictions and sentence, but they were upheld by the court of appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/08/us/conviction-upheld-in-fertility-case.html | title=Conviction Upheld In Fertility Case | date=1993-09-08 | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-4th-circuit/1051498.html | title='''''UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT No. 93-1986''''' ST.

'''Charles Augustus Hawley''' (March 13, 1861 – July 22, 1929) was an American Orthodontist who is known for developing the [[Hawley Retainer]] which is used in the field of Orthodontics. He attended [[Angle School of Orthodontia]] and graduated from there in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Paul|title=Charles A Hawley - Orthodontic Profiles|journal=AJODO|date=1963|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/000294166390099X/1-s2.0-000294166390099X-main.pdf?_tid=3e8a32b4-a663-11e5-a5b7-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1450538268_b55ad434bc8343efc3bc8954469133b9|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asbell|first1=MIlton|title=A brief history of Orthodontics|journal=AJODO|date=1990|url=http://www.tanaka.com.br/Conteudo/orthodentails/ASBELL%20M%20A%20brief%20history%20of%20orthodontics%20AJODO%20v%2098%20n%203%20p206_.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Avery, Ohio]] in 1861. He attended high school in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and then attended [[Ohio State University]] for his college degree. He then attended [[University of Michigan School of Dentistry]] and obtained his degree in 1893. He then became the Professor of Operative faculty soon after his graduation from the school. He is known to be one of the first people to have used nitrous oxide as an anesthetic for the removal of teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Paul|title=Charles A Hawley - Orthodontic Profiles|journal=AJODO|date=1963|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/000294166390099X/1-s2.0-000294166390099X-main.pdf?_tid=3e8a32b4-a663-11e5-a5b7-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1450538268_b55ad434bc8343efc3bc8954469133b9|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Angle School of Orthodontia and graduated in 1905. He moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] after and became the first person to specialize in Orthodontics in that city.

He was married to Evelyn Frank Hawley.

==Career==
In the field of Orthodontics, he is best known for his introduction of a refined type of retention plate called the Hawley Bite Plate. Two of Dr. Hawley's papers ''Determination of the Normal Arch and Its Application to Orthodontia'' and ''An Accurate Method in Orthodontia'' were read before 4th [[FDI World Dental Federation|International Dental Congress]] and New York Institute of Stomatology. These papers were direct results of Dr. Hawley's work.

==Positions held==
* American Society of Orthodontists, President, 1908
* New York Society of Orthodontists, President, 1929
* Southern Society of Orthodontist, President-Elect
* District of Columbia Dental Society, President
* American College of Dentists, Fellow

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3677">'''Clarifying agents''' are used to remove suspended solids from liquids by inducing [[flocculation]] (the solids begin to aggregate forming flakes, which either precipitate to the bottom or float to the surface of the liquid, and then they can be removed or collected).

==Process==
Particles finer than 0.1&amp;nbsp;µm (10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;m) in water remains continuously in motion due to electrostatic charge (often negative) which causes them to repel each other. Once their electrostatic charge is neutralized by the use of a coagulant chemical, the finer particles start to collide and agglomerate (collect together) under the influence of [[van der Waals force|Van der Waals]]'s forces. These larger and heavier particles are called flocs.

Flocculants, or flocculating agents (also known as flocking agents), are chemicals that promote flocculation by causing [[colloid]]s and other suspended particles in liquids to aggregate, forming a floc. Flocculants are used in water treatment processes to improve the sedimentation or filterability of small particles. For example, a flocculant may be used in [[swimming pool]] or [[drinking water]] filtration to aid removal of microscopic particles which would otherwise cause the [[water]] to be [[Turbidity|turbid]] (cloudy) and which would be difficult or impossible to remove by filtration alone.

Many flocculants are multivalent [[cations]] such as [[aluminium]], [[iron]], [[calcium]] or [[magnesium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Global Health and Education Foundation | title = Conventional Coagulation-Flocculation-Sedimentation | work = Safe Drinking Water is Essential | publisher = National Academy of Sciences | year = 2007 | url = http://drinking-water.org/html/en/Treatment/Coagulation-Flocculation-technologies.html | accessdate = 2007-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These positively charged molecules interact with negatively charged particles and molecules to reduce the barriers to aggregation. In addition, many of these chemicals, under appropriate [[pH]] and other conditions such as temperature and [[salinity]], react with water to form insoluble [[hydroxide]]s which, upon precipitating, link together to form long chains or meshes, physically trapping small particles into the larger floc.

Long-chain polymer flocculants, such as modified [[polyacrylamide]]s, are manufactured and sold by the flocculant producing business. These can be supplied in dry or liquid form for use in the flocculation process. The most common liquid polyacrylamide is supplied as an emulsion with 10-40% actives and the rest is a non-aqueous carrier fluid, surfactants and [[latex]]. This form allows easy handling of viscous polymers at high concentrations. These emulsion polymers require "activation" - inversion of the emulsion so that the polymers molecules form an aqueous solution.

==Agents==
*[[alum]]
*[[aluminium chlorohydrate]]
*[[aluminium sulphate]]
*[[calcium oxide]]
*[[calcium hydroxide]]
*[[iron(II) sulphate]] (ferrous sulphate)
*[[iron(III) chloride]] (ferric chloride)
*[[polyacrylamide]]
*[[polyDADMAC]]
*[[sodium aluminate]]
*[[sodium silicate]]

The following natural products are used as flocculants:&lt;ref&gt;P. Somasundaran "Encyclopedia of surface and colloid science, Volume 7, pp 4980-4982."&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Chitosan]]
* [[Isinglass]]
* [[Moringa oleifera]] seeds (Horseradish Tree)

* [[Guar gum]]
* [[Alginates]] (brown seaweed extracts)

'''Colcom Foods Limited''' is a long established meat-processing company in [[Zimbabwe]].  It is principally a pork company, with a joint venture—Associated Meat Packers (AMP)—producing beef products. Colcom Foods is part of the Colcom Holdings Group, which in turn is majority owned by Innscor Africa. Both Innscor and Colcom are listed on the [[Zimbabwe Stock Exchange]].

==History==
Colcom’s origins are in a farmer-owned cooperative established in late 1943 in Southern Rhodesia to assist with the marketing of their pigs.  The then [[Cold Storage Commission]] acted as their agents until 1961, when the Cooperative’s first processing factory was built on the present site in Harare.  In 1993 Colcom was successfully floated on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange and became a publicly quoted company.  Colcom supplies wholesalers and retailers nationwide and operates its own and franchised outlets, including a Training Centre at “The Colcom Kitchen”.

'''Cyril Harrison Wecht''' (born March 20, 1931) is an American [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]]. He has been a consultant in numerous high-profile cases, but is perhaps best known for his criticism of the [[Warren Commission]]'s findings concerning the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].

He has been the president of both the [[American Academy of Forensic Science]] and the American College of Legal Medicine, and currently{{when|date=May 2017}} heads the board of trustees of the [[American Board of Legal Medicine]]. He served as [[County Commissioner]] and [[Allegheny County Medical Examiner|Allegheny County Coroner &amp; Medical Examiner]] serving the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area]].

==Background==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}
Wecht was born to [[Jewish]] immigrant parents in a tiny mining village in [[Dunkard Township, Pennsylvania]] called [[Bobtown, Pennsylvania|Bobtown]]. His father, Nathan Wecht, was a [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]]-born storekeeper; his [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]-born mother, Fannie Rubenstein, was a homemaker and helped out in the store. When Wecht was young, Nathan moved the family to the [[Hill District (Pittsburgh)|Hill District neighborhood]] of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] and opened a neighborhood [[grocery store]]. He attended and graduated from the now closed [[Fifth Avenue High School]] in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXZ_GA7VH_Y&amp;NR=1|title=PCNC NightTalk 4th Anniversary Party 8-7-00 - Look Back|publisher=YouTube|date=2008-07-20|accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wecht had musical leanings and was concertmaster of the [[University of Pittsburgh]] Orchestra&lt;ref&gt;Music Man (letter) Pitt Magazine, Spring 2007, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; during his undergraduate years. He earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1952, an M.D. degree from the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine]] in 1956, an [[Bachelor of Law|LL.B.]] from the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]] in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/?p=1821|title=Class Notes|journal=Pitt Magazine|date=Winter 2010|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from the [[University of Maryland School of Law]]{{when|date=January 2018}}. After serving in the [[United States Air Force]], he became a forensic pathologist. He served on the staff of St. Francis Hospital in Pittsburgh before becoming Deputy Coroner of Allegheny County in 1965. Four years later he was elected coroner. Wecht served as coroner from 1970 to 1980, and again from 1996 to 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Wecht became famous appearing on television and consulting on deaths with a high media profile. Some of the cases include; [[Robert F. Kennedy]], [[Sharon Tate]], [[Brian Jones]], The Symbionese Liberation Army shootout, [[John F. Kennedy]], The Legionnaires' Disease panic, [[Elvis Presley]], [[JonBenét Ramsey]], Dr. [[Herman Tarnower]] (the Scarsdale diet guru), [[Murder of Danielle van Dam|Danielle van Dam]], [[Sunny von Bülow]], the [[Branch Davidian]] incident, [[Vincent Foster]], [[Laci Peterson]], [[Daniel Wayne Smith|Daniel]], [[Anna Nicole Smith]], and [[Rebecca Zahau]]. During his career, Wecht performed more than 14,000 [[autopsy|autopsies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Batz Jr. |first1=Bob |title=Cyril H.

Wecht is both outspoken and controversial. In 1979, Wecht examined [[Elvis Presley]]'s medical records for ''[[20/20]]'' and disputed earlier autopsy results suggesting Presley may have had cardiovascular disease. Wecht argued Presley died from a lethal drug cocktail overdose.&lt;ref name='The Wecht Files'&gt;{{cite news|author=Charlie Dietrich|title=The Wecht Files|date=2007-12-20|publisher=Pittsburgh City Paper|url=http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A39852}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Who Killed JonBenet Ramsey?'', he argues that the death was likely an accidental result of a sex "game" committed by her father.&lt;ref name="The Wecht Files"/&gt;

===Cyril H. Wecht and Pathology Associates===
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}
Since 1962, Wecht has had a private practice. He has served as a medical-legal and forensic pathology consultant in both civil and criminal cases. Wecht is consulted by both plaintiffs' and defense attorneys in civil cases, and by both prosecutors and defense attorneys in criminal cases in jurisdictions throughout the United States and abroad.

His forensic consultant engagements include:
* for the [[Los Angeles County Coroner's Office]] in regard to the 1968 [[Robert F. Kennedy]] assassination, the 1969 Sharon Tate/LaBianca cases, and the 1974 Symbionese Liberation Army Deaths;
* for the Health Hospital, Panama Canal Zone as a member of the Special Expert Panel on American Legionnaires' Disease (Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Centers for Disease Control)

====JFK assassination====
In 1965 Wecht presented a paper critiquing the [[Warren Commission]] to the meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Greg|date=February 12, 1989|title=Cyril Wecht continues to probe JFK murder|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iboiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RrUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2485%2C2151791|department=Sunday Times|newspaper=Beaver County Times|location=Beaver, Pennsylvania|page=6|access-date=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 Wecht was the first civilian ever given permission to examine the Kennedy assassination evidence. It was Wecht who first discovered that Kennedy's brain, and all related data in the killing, had gone missing.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Fred|date=August 27, 1972|title=Mystery Cloaks Fate of Brain of Kennedy|url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/A%20Disk/Abzug%20Bella/Item%2004.pdf |newspaper=The New York Times|location=New York City|access-date=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, he testified before the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] as the lone dissenter on a nine-member forensic pathology panel re-examining the assassination of John F. Kennedy, which had concurred with the Warren Commission conclusions and [[single bullet theory]]. Out of the four official examinations into the Kennedy Assassination, Wecht is the only forensic pathologist who has disagreed with the conclusion that both the single bullet theory and Kennedy's head wounds are mutually consistent.&lt;ref name='Select Committee on Assassinations'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives|journal=The National Archives|volume=The JFK Assassination Records|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1a.html#reliance|accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Bugliosi]], ''[[Reclaiming History]]'', p. 863&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Testimony of Dr. Cyril H.

==Political career==
===Early years (1965–1985)===
In 1965, Wecht became Deputy Coroner of Allegheny County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Key Coroner Aides Named by Dr. Hunt |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23535091/the_pittsburgh_press/ |accessdate=7 September 2018 |work=[[Pittsburgh Press]] |date=31 December 1965 |page=17 |via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later he was elected Coroner of Allegheny County. Wecht served as coroner from 1970 to 1980. His initial departure from the office of Coroner was not met without controversy. Wecht did not resign as Coroner until January 9, two days after his swearing-in as an [[County commission|Allegheny County Commissioner]], as the law did not prohibit him from holding both the offices of Coroner and Commissioner.&lt;ref name=CoronerResign&gt;{{cite news|title=Wecht Resigns As County Coroner|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-GgdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Q1wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5552,2644746&amp;dq=allegheny+county+coroner&amp;hl=en|accessdate=December 30, 2011|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=January 9, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He resigned under pressure from a variety of sources, including his predecessor as Coroner, Dr. Ralph Stalter, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and the administration of [[Governor of Pennsylvania|Governor]] [[Dick Thornburgh]], also a Republican.&lt;ref name=CoronerTwo&gt;{{cite news|title=Wecht Reported Ready to Quit Coroner Post|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=92gdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Q1wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6168,2527251&amp;dq=allegheny+county+coroner&amp;hl=en|accessdate=December 30, 2011|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=January 8, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially recommended that Dr. [[Joshua Perper]] succeed him, and indeed Perper held the title of Acting Coroner until Thornburgh appointed Dr. Sanford Edburg to succeed Wecht. While Perper initially rejected the appointment as unconstitutional, the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court|State Supreme Court]] upheld Thornburgh's right to appoint Edberg, who duly took over the office of Coroner on March 2, 1981.&lt;ref name=CoronerControversy&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Toole|first=James|title=Edberg wins coroner title in court|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PugNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qW0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3648,146424&amp;dq=allegheny+county+coroner&amp;hl=en|accessdate=December 30, 2011|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=March 3, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, he was elected chairman of the Allegheny County Democratic Party. One year later, Wecht was elected to the [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County Board of Commissioners]]. In [[United States Senate elections, 1982|1982]], he was the Democratic party's nominee to oppose freshman Senator [[H. John Heinz III|John Heinz]] in bid for a second term; Heinz won the election with 59 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Barone (pundit)|Barone, Michael]]; and Ujifusa, Grant. ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]] 1988', p. 1006. ''[[National Journal]]'', 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wecht and fellow Democratic County Commissioner [[Tom Foerster]] were frequently at odds, and battled for control of the Democratic Party in Allegheny County, which Wecht chaired. Although the Democratic Committee rejected Foerster and endorsed Wecht for re-election as commissioner in 1983, the committee paired him with Sheriff Gene Coon, with whom he also had a longstanding political feud. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Foerster teamed up with former Pittsburgh Mayor [[Pete Flaherty]], and the two defeated Wecht and Coon in the primary election for the two Democratic nominations. Wecht then lost the chairmanship of the county's Democratic Party in 1984 to Foerster's hand-picked candidate, Scott Township Tax Collector Ed Stevens.  Wecht then sought to become chair of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party that same year, but was defeated by [[Ed Mezvinsky]], a former Congressman from Iowa. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Later years (1995–2006)===
In 1995, Wecht, after 12 years out of public life, was again elected as Allegheny County's Coroner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Becker |first1=Geoff |title=Voters bring Wecht back as coroner |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23534809/news_record/ |accessdate=7 September 2018 |work=News Record |date=8 November 1995 |location=North Hills, Pennsylvania |page=A8 |via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he ran for the newly created position of Allegheny County Chief Executive, defeating one-term minority County Commissioner [[Mike Dawida]] in the Democratic primary, but losing to prominent Republican businessman [[Jim Roddey]] in his first bid for elective public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Toole |first1=James |title=Rodney wins historic vote |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23534933/pittsburgh_postgazette/ |accessdate=7 September 2018 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=3 November 1999 |page=1 |via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While serving as the county's coroner, Wecht continued to operate a private forensic consulting business on the side known as Wecht Pathology Associates.&lt;ref name="The Wecht Files"/&gt; Wecht Pathology Associates charges clients for examining cases, conducting autopsies, and testifying in civil and criminal trials. In his official capacity as county coroner, Wecht continued to squabble with DA Zappala, often over deaths that took place during encounters with police.&lt;ref name="The Wecht Files"/&gt;

In the case that is the precursor to Wecht's federal prosecution, US vs. Wecht, Wecht ruled that Charles Dixon had been suffocated through positional asphyxiation during a 2002 encounter with police officers from Mount Oliver and Pittsburgh. When Wecht ruled the death of Dixon a homicide, DA Zappala refused to press charges against the officers. In response, Wecht, acting in his private capacity as an employee of Wecht Pathology Associates, wrote a medical opinion outlining the officers' alleged role in Dixon's death which was utilized by Dixon's family in a civil suit against the county.&lt;ref name="The Wecht Files"/&gt;

In response to Wecht's testimony in the Dixon case, Zappala accused Wecht of violating the federal Hobbs Act, which prohibits public officials from using their offices for private gain. In early 2005, Zappala launched an investigation into whether Wecht had been using county resources to carry out private work — allegations similar to those Wecht had faced before.  By spring of 2005, FBI agents were seizing documents in Wecht's private and county offices.&lt;ref name="The Wecht Files"/&gt;

Wecht continued to serve as Coroner until the position was eliminated in 2006.  County Executive [[Dan Onorato]] named him as the county's first appointed Medical Examiner in 2006.  By January 2006, a federal grand jury had indicted Wecht on 84 criminal counts, prompting Wecht to step down from his county post per an agreement he made when the investigation became public in 2004 that if indicted he would resign as county coroner.&lt;ref name="The Wecht Files"/&gt;

==Court cases==
===Allegheny County criminal trial (1979–1981)===
Wecht's tenure as Allegheny County Coroner was controversial. While he was responsible for significant upgrades in the professionalism and technology of the coroner's office during his service in that office from 1970 to 1980, making the Allegheny County Coroner's office one of the best in the nation, Wecht's political career proved controversial due to his opinionated nature and as he put it his unwillingness to "run away from a fight."&lt;ref name="The Wecht Files"/&gt;

In 1979 Wecht was accused of performing autopsies for other counties at the county morgue and depositing the fees from these autopsies in his private business's bank account. Wecht responded that the funds in question had been used solely to upgrade the office and staff.&lt;ref name='Wecht no stranger to controversy'&gt;{{cite news|first= James|last=O'Toole|author2=Charlie Dietrich|title=Wecht no stranger to controversy|date=2006-01-21|publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06021/641949.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long investigation, Wecht was indicted on multiple criminal counts that charged Wecht with personally profiting from work at the coroner's office.  Wecht allegedly transacted approximately $400,000 of his private business work using county facilities and the county morgue.&lt;ref name="The Wecht Files"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wecht no stranger to controversy"/&gt; In spring 1981, the six-week-long criminal trial began. All charges were dismissed except for one, theft of services. Wecht was acquitted on the remaining charge.&lt;ref name="The Wecht Files"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wecht no stranger to controversy"/&gt;

The original judge at trial was censured by a judge's panel and some findings vacated due to judicial misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Maryniak|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lcUdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=51wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2840%2C2586176|title=Judge's Conduct Issue in Wecht Case|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|date=February 7, 1981|accessdate=2014-03-22|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wecht's attorneys alleged that he was a victim of a political conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James O'Toole |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ooBIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rW0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2362%2C980731|title=Attorneys attempt to prove anti-Wecht conspiracy|publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''|date=February 6, 1981|accessdate=2014-03-22|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegheny County civil trial===
Although Wecht was acquitted in the criminal case, the County Controller levied a civil surcharge of $390,000 against him for mingling private and public work at the morgue. In 1983, a civil court ruled that Wecht owed the county $172,410. On appeal, the original award to the county was increased to $250,000. In 1992, the county and Wecht reached a settlement resulting in Wecht having to repay the county $200,000.&lt;ref name="The Wecht Files"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wecht no stranger to controversy"/&gt;

===Federal criminal trial===
On January 28, 2008, a federal trial against Wecht began, on charges of public corruption. Roughly two weeks prior to the trial, 43 of the 84 counts against Wecht were withdrawn; judge [[Arthur J. Schwab]] dismissed those charges with prejudice.&lt;ref name='Judge approves dismissal of some Wecht charges'&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Cato|title=Judge approves dismissal of some Wecht charges|date=2008-01-04|publisher=''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review''|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/specialreports/wecht/trial/s_545883.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601041335/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/specialreports/wecht/trial/s_545883.html|archivedate=2008-06-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following trial the jury could not reach agreement on the remaining counts, and the judge declared a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]]. The prosecution immediately announced that they planned to retry Wecht.&lt;ref name='Wecht trial over; feds to try again'&gt;

Congressmen [[Michael F.

Op-eds in The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' and the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' called for dismissal of the proposed re-trial.&lt;ref name="Prosecution says Wecht retrial needs 'outsiders"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Cato|title=Prosecution says Wecht retrial needs 'outsiders'|date=2008-04-16|publisher=''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review''|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/cityregion/s_562599.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506085422/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/cityregion/s_562599.html|archivedate=2008-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 12, 2008, 33 prominent leaders in the Pittsburgh community sent a letter to Attorney General [[Michael Mukasey]] and US Attorney [[Mary Beth Buchanan]] requesting that the prosecution dismiss the indictment against Wecht. Shortly after the press release of this letter, Senator [[Arlen Specter]] publicly recommended against a retrial for Wecht.&lt;ref name='Open Letter Calling for Reconsideration of Wecht Retrial'&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Kiel|title=Open Letter Calling for Reconsideration of Wecht Retrial|date=2008-04-16|publisher=Talking Points Memo|url=http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/docs/wecht-retrial-letter|access-date=2008-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624181230/http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/docs/wecht-retrial-letter/|archive-date=2008-06-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former jurors stated to the press that they believed that the prosecution had been politically motivated.&lt;ref name='Ex-coroner Wecht not a criminal, jurors say'&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Cato|title=Ex-coroner Wecht not a criminal, jurors say|date=2008-04-29|publisher=''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review''|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_564787.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506123153/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_564787.html|archivedate=2008-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 2008, the Department of Justice's [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] (OPR) revealed that it initiated an investigation into the Wecht prosecution due to claims that the case was a "selective prosecution".&lt;ref name='U.

'''The Danvers State Hospital''', also known as the '''State Lunatic Hospital at Danvers''', '''The Danvers Lunatic Asylum''', and '''The Danvers State Insane Asylum''', was a psychiatric hospital located in [[Danvers, Massachusetts]]. It was built in 1874, and opened in 1878, under the supervision of prominent [[Boston]] architect [[Nathaniel Jeremiah Bradlee]], on an isolated site in rural [[Massachusetts]]. It was a multi-acre, self-contained [[psychiatric hospital]] designed and built according to the [[Kirkbride Plan]]. 

In spite of being included in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984, the majority of the building was demolished in 2007.&lt;ref name=trask/&gt;

==History==
The [https://www.danversstateinsaneasylum.com/ Danvers State Hospital] was officially opened in 1878 after four years of construction.&lt;ref name=trask/&gt; [[Nathaniel Jeremiah Bradlee]] served as the designing architect.&lt;ref name=trask/&gt;

At a cost of $1.5 million at the time, the hospital originally consisted of two main center buildings, housing the administration, with four radiating wings on each side of the Administration Block. The kitchen, laundry, chapel, and dormitories for the attendants were in a connecting building in the rear. Middleton Pond supplied the hospital its water. On each side of the main building were the wings, for male and female patients respectively. The outermost wards were reserved for the most hostile patients.

Over the years, newer buildings were constructed around the original Kirkbride, and alterations were made to the Kirkbride itself, such as a new gymnasium/auditorium on the area of the old kitchens and multiple solaria added onto the front of the wards.

Most of the buildings on campus were connected by a labyrinth of underground tunnels. Many of the Commonwealth institutions for the developmentally delayed and the mentally ill at the time were designed with tunnel systems, to be self-sufficient in wintertime. There was a tunnel that ran from a steam/power generating plant (which still exists to provide service to the Hogan Regional Center) located at the bottom of the hill running up to the hospital, along with tunnels that connected the male and female nurses homes, the "Gray Gables", Bonner Medical Building, machine shops, pump house, and a few others. 

The original plan was designed to house 500 patients, with attic space potentially housing 100 more. By the late 1930s and 1940s, over 2,000 patients were being housed, and overcrowding was severe. People were even held in the basements of the Kirkbride.

While the asylum was established to provide residential treatment and care to the mentally ill, its functions expanded to include a training program for nurses in 1889 and a pathological research laboratory in 1895. In the 1890s, Dr. Charles Page, the superintendent, declared mechanical restraint unnecessary and harmful in cases of mental illness. By the 1920s the hospital was operating school clinics to help determine mental deficiency in children. Reports were made[who?] that various inhumane shock therapies, lobotomies, drugs, and straitjackets were being used to keep the crowded hospital under control. This sparked controversy. During the 1960s as a result of increased emphasis on alternative methods of treatment, deinstitutionalization, and community-based mental health care, the inpatient population started to decrease.

Massive budget cuts in the 1960s played a major role in the progressive closing of Danvers State hospital. The hospital began closing wards and facilities as early as 1969. By 1985, the majority of the original hospital wards were closed or abandoned. The Administration Block, in the original Kirkbride, building closed in 1989. Patients were moved to the Bonner Medical Building across the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brooks |first1=Rebecca Beatrice |title=History of Danvers State Hospital |url=http://historyofmassachusetts.org/history-of-danvers-state-hospital/ |website=historyofmassachusetts.org |publisher=History of Massachusetts |accessdate=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire campus was closed on June 24, 1992 and all patients were either transferred to the community or to other facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About |url=https://www.danversstateinsaneasylum.com/ |website=danversstateinsaneasylum.com |accessdate=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demolition==
[[File:Danvers2.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Demolition of administration building.]]
In December 2005, the property was sold to AvalonBay Communities, a residential apartment developer. A lawsuit was filed by a local preservation fund&lt;ref name=cassidy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opacity.us/article7_bad_news_for_danvers_state_hospital.htm|work=Salem News| via=Opacity|date=November 9, 2005| title=Bad News for Danvers State Hospital| author=Cassidy, Chris| accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to stave off the demolition of the hospital, including the [[Kirkbride Plan|Kirkbride building]], which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  This did not stop the process, however, and demolition of most of the buildings began in January 2006, with the intent to build 497 apartments on the {{convert|77|acre|m2|sing=on}} site.

By June 2006, all of the Danvers State Hospital buildings that were marked for demolition had been torn down, including all of the unused buildings and old homes on the lower grounds and all of the buildings on the hill. Demolition was done by Testa Corp. of Wakefield, Massachusetts. The historic Kirkbride was also demolished, with only the outermost brick shell of the administration area (along with the G and D wards on each side) being propped up during demolition and construction while an entirely new structure was built behind and inside of it, leaving the historic Danvers Reservoir and the original brick shell. Much of the wood from the demolition project was salvaged and recycled into flooring and other millwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Longleaf Lumber Salvaged Danvers State Hospital Woods|url=http://www.longleaflumber.com/danvers-state-hospital//|date=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A replica of the original tower/steeple on the Kirkbride was built to duplicate what was removed around 1970, due to structural issues. (The first picture illustrates the original tower in 1893, the second and third pictures illustrate the new replica in 2006 and 2007, and the fourth picture illustrates the one from 1970.) Avalon Bay predicted that they would have properties available for rent or sale by Fall 2007.
[[File:Former Danvers State Hospital, Danvers MA.jpg|thumb|right|Kirkbride complex of the former Danvers State Hospital, pictured in 2010.]]
On April 7, 2007, four of the apartment complex buildings and four of Avalon Bay's construction trailers burned down in a large fire visible from [[Boston]], nearly {{cvt|17|mi}} away. Damage was confined mostly to the buildings under construction on the eastern end, but the remaining Kirkbride spires caught fire due to the high heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salemnews.com/fire-at-danvers-state-hospital-had-tremendous-head-start/article_eff3fe4e-ce5c-5a98-9f2a-cf0d196d2e97.html|work=Salem News|title=Fire at Danvers State Hospital had 'tremendous head start'|author=Roy, Matthew Kay|date=April 8, 2007|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underground tunnel leading up from the power plant still exists, but is blocked at the top of the hill. Only the exterior of the Kirkbride complex was preserved in the demolition, and the cemeteries, several blocked tunnels, and the brick shell of the administration and the D and G wings are all that remain from the original site. Richard Trask of the Danvers Archival Center wrote, concerning the state's failure to preserve the Kirkbride complex, noting:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The failure to protect and adaptively reuse this grand exterior is a monumental blot in the annals of Massachusetts preservation. What might have been a dignified transformation of a magnificent structure which was originally built to serve the best intentions, but at times lost its way through human frailty, now is a mere ghost-image of itself. And we and our progeny are the losers.&lt;ref name=trask&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danverslibrary.org/archive/?page_id=1096|work=The Danvers Archival Center|publisher=Peabody Institute Library|author=Trask, Richard M.|date=2008|accessdate=May 10, 2017|title=History: Danvers State Hospital}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 27, 2014, Avalon Bay Communities, Inc,. sold the property for $108.5 M to the DSF Group.&lt;ref name=castelluccio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salemnews.com/news/local_news/boston-group-buys-avalon-danvers-for-m/article_98f9f2a8-d1e9-57ce-a4ec-d8946ae69296.html|work=Salem News|title=Boston group buys Avalon Danvers for $108.5M| author= Castelluccio, John| date= Jul 3, 2014| accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSF Group released plans for the property to undergo further renovations.&lt;ref name=castelluccio/&gt;

* The hospital was the setting for the 2001 horror film ''[[Session 9]]''.&lt;ref name=cassidy/&gt; The asylum was also featured in the 1958 film ''[[Home Before Dark (1958 film)|Home Before Dark]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9005">The '''death row phenomenon''' is the emotional [[stress (medicine)|distress]] felt by [[prison]]ers on [[death row]]. Concerns about the ethics of inflicting this distress upon prisoners have led to some legal concerns about the [[constitution]]ality of the [[death penalty]] in the [[United States]] and other countries. In relation to the use of solitary confinement with death row inmates, death row phenomenon and '''death row syndrome''' are two concepts that are gaining ground. The death row syndrome is a distinct concept, which is the enduring psychological effects of the death row phenomenon, which merely refers to the triggers of the syndrome.

Harrison and Tamony&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetjournalofcriminology.com/Harrison_Tamony_%20Death_Row_Syndrome%20_IJC_Nov_2010.pdf Harrison, K. and Tamony, A. (2010). "Death Row Phenomenon, Death Row Syndrome and their Effect on Capital Cases in the US". November 2010. ''Internet Journal of Criminology''.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713050059/http://www.internetjournalofcriminology.com/Harrison_Tamony_%20Death_Row_Syndrome%20_IJC_Nov_2010.pdf |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; define ''death row phenomenon'' as the harmful effects of death row conditions, while ''death row syndrome'' is the consequent manifestation of psychological illness that can occur as a result of death row phenomenon.

==Phenomenon==
Death row syndrome is a psychological disorder that inmates on death row can go through when they are put in isolation. Inmates affected by death row syndrome may display suicidal tendencies and psychotic delusions. According to some [[psychiatrist]]s, the results of being confined to death row for an extended period of time, including the effects of knowing one will die and the living conditions, can fuel [[delusion]]s and [[suicide|suicidal]] tendencies in an individual and can cause [[insanity]] in a form that is dangerous.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Avi Salzman, "[http://www.scu.edu/news/rossdeathpenalty.cfm Killer's Fate May Rest on New Legal Concept]", [[Santa Clara University]], 1 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners wait years for execution on death row and while waiting the prisoners go through painful isolation. They live in cells the size of parking spaces. Living in this kind of condition can amplify the effects of isolation. Most of the inmates stay in their cells for more than twenty hours a day. This kind of isolation and waiting for execution causes many inmates to die naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Inglis-Arkell, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The suicide rate of death row inmates was found by Lester and Tartaro to be 113 per 100,000 for the period 1976–1999. This is about ten times the rate of [[suicide in the United States]] as a whole and about six times the rate of suicide in the general U.S. prison population.&lt;ref&gt;"Suicide on death row", David Lester and Christine Tartaro, ''Journal of Forensic Sciences'', ISSN 0022-1198, 2002, vol. 47, no 5, pp. 1108–1111&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the re-institution of the death penalty in 1976 to January 1, 2017, 145 prisoners have waived their appeals and asked that the execution be carried out. In the post-''[[William_Henry_Furman|Furman]]'' era, four states (Connecticut, New Mexico, Oregon, and Pennsylvania) have executed only volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/information-defendants-who-were-executed-1976-and-designated-volunteers|title=deathpenaltyinfo.org|author=|date=|website=DeathPentaltyInfo.org|access-date=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of the death row phenomenon may be traced to 1989, when the [[European Court of Human Rights]] agreed that poor conditions on death row in [[Virginia]] should mean that a fugitive should not be extradited to the US unless the US agreed it would not execute the fugitive should he or she be convicted.&lt;ref name="Ross" /&gt; Additionally, the number of years that the fugitive would be on death row was considered problematic.  The case is known as ''[[Soering v. United Kingdom]]''.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Rhona K.M. Smith, ''Textbook on International Human Rights'', second edition, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier, however, in 1950, a justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Solesbee v. Balkcom]]'' remarked that the "onset of insanity while awaiting execution of a death sentence is not a rare phenomenon". Often the death row phenomenon, being a result of a prolonged stay on death row, is an unintentional result of the long procedures used in the attempt to ensure the death penalty is applied only to the guilty.&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;''[[United States v. Burns]]'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal ramifications==
{{As of|2013}}, arguments about the death row phenomenon have never been successful in avoiding the death penalty for any person in the US, but the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] has been aware of the theory and has mentioned it in its decisions.  When a [[serial killer]] named [[Michael Bruce Ross]] agreed to be executed in 2005, this had also led to a legal dispute over whether he could ever legally agree to such a thing, as the death row phenomenon might have contributed to his decision.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;

In Canada, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] cited the death row phenomenon, along with a few other concerns about execution, to declare the risk of a prisoner being executed after he or she is extradited to another country to be a breach of [[fundamental justice]], a legal right under [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 7]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] in the [[Constitution of Canada]].  The case was ''[[United States v. Burns]]'' (2001).  Earlier, in 1991, some Supreme Court justices had, in ''[[Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice)]]'', expressed skepticism about the legal argument regarding the phenomenon, writing that the stress was not as severe a punishment as the execution itself, and writing that the prisoners themselves choose to appeal their sentences, thus being responsible for the prolonged stay on death row.  In ''Burns'', however, the Court acknowledged that the mere process of execution, including making sure that the sentence is carried out justly, "seems inevitably to provide lengthy delays, and the associated psychological trauma."  This cast doubt on whether the risk of execution after extradition, as a whole, could be compatible with the principles of fundamental justice.&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt;

In [[Jamaica]], in the case ''[[Pratt v A-G of Jamaica|Pratt v Attorney General for Jamaica]]'', the death penalty was overturned for two prisoners by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], who had made reference to the death row phenomenon.  In these judges' opinions, the prisoners had been on death row for too long, and that too many appeals were allowed to the prisoners, who were forced by instinct to attempt to appeal and were thus confined to death row for too long.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

United States Supreme Court Justices opposing the death penalty, such as [[Justice Stevens]] and [[Justice Breyer]], have at multiple times argued in their [[dissenting opinion|dissents]] that the delay and waiting on death row was a factor making capital punishment unconstitutional as a cruel and unusual punishment. Their views were rejected by [[concurring opinion]]s from more conservative justices such as [[Justice Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas|Justice Thomas]], who said that this long delay was caused by the convicts themselves and by "Justices opposed to the death penalty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BAZE et al. v.

'''Ernst Jean-Joseph''' (born 11 June 1948) is a [[Haiti]]an [[association football|football]] [[midfielder]] who played for [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=39/teams/team=43908.html 1974 FIFA World Cup Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; He played for [[Violette A.C.]] and [[Chicago Sting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasljerseys.com/Players/J/Jean-Joseph.Ernst.htm NASL career stats]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Haiti's decent showing against Italy in the tournament - a game in which Jean-Joseph's team had briefly led - celebrations were undermined by his failing of a dope test.  Haiti's officials meted out their own punishment before flying the player home. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sabotagetimes.com/football-sport/how-voodoo-and-gangsters-took-haiti-to-the-world-cup-part-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''First Nations Health Authority''' ('''FNHA''') is a health service delivery organization responsible for administering a variety of health programs and service for [[First Nations in BC|First Nations people living in BC]]. The FNHA is part of a [[First Nations]] Health Governance Structure in BC that includes the First Nations Health Council and First Nations Health Directors Association. The First Nations Health Authority emerged from a number of Tripartite agreements between [[BC First Nations]], the [[BC, Canada|Province of BC]], and the [[Government of Canada]] that included the Transformative Change Accord: First Nations Health Plan [2006],&lt;ref&gt;Transformative Change Accord: First Nations Health Plan http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2006/first_nations_health_implementation_plan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Tripartite First Nations Health Plan [2007],&lt;ref&gt;Tripartite First Nations Health Plan [2007] http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2007/tripartite_plan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nations Health Governance.&lt;ref&gt;British Columbia Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/pubs/services/tripartite/framework-accord-cadre-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt;
A first for [[Canada]], the FNHA is the first province-wide First Nations Health Authority in Canada. The FNHA plans, designs, manages and funds the delivery of [[First Nations]] health programs and services in BC. These community-based services are largely focused on health promotion and disease prevention - such as:
* Primary Care Services
* Mental Health and Addictions Programming
* Health Infrastructure
* Environmental Health and Research
* [[Non-Insured Health Benefits]]

The FNHA strives to improve First Nations health outcomes and close the gaps that exist between [[First Nations in BC|First Nations people in BC]] and the rest of the provincial population.&lt;ref&gt;Implementing the Vision: BC First Nations Health Governance. {{ISBN|978-0-9867697-0-2}} http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/pubs/services/tripartite/vision-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt; The FNHA serves both the urban and rural First Nations population that includes 203 communities throughout the province.

'''Introduction'''

FIAN International - formerly, FoodFirst Information and Action Network - was founded in 1986 as the first international human rights organization to advocate for the realization of the right to food and nutrition.
Holding a consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, FIAN is active in more than 50 countries, through national sections and seeds groups, which account for 25 of these, as well as individual members and international networks. With no religious or political affiliation dictating its work, FIAN International exposes violations of people's right to food and related rights wherever they may occur and stands up against undue and oppressive practices that prevent people from feeding themselves. 

By holding governments accountable, FIAN International strives to secure people's access to and control over natural resources and means of subsistence, crucial to ensure a life of dignity, now and for future generations. Nutrition, as an inherent component of the right to food, and a fundamental act of food sovereignty, remains a core objective in FIAN's work. As the struggle against gender discrimination and other forms of exclusion is an integral part of its mission, FIAN works with and in favor of the most marginalized and affected groups: its vision is of a world free from hunger, in which every woman, man, boy and girl can fully enjoy their right to food, as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. 

FIAN International's Secretariat is based in Heidelberg, Germany, and Geneva, Switzerland.

'''Organizational Structure'''

FIAN is an international membership based organisation. FIAN's institutional members are its national sections which are legal entities in their own right and have their own membership and elected decision-making bodies.

Current sections of FIAN can be found in some 25 countries, for updates look at [http://www.fian.org/about-us/worldwide/ Worldwide]. 

The overall mission, vision and the strategy of FIAN is defined and revised by the International Council (IC), and represented by delegates of the sections who meet once every three years. The IC elects the International Executive Committee (IEC) -headed by the president, which supervises the implementation of FIAN’s strategic plans. The IEC meets bi-annually to review and strategize FIAN programs, methods and budgets. 

The operative working unit being in charge of the execution of FIAN’s programs is its International Secretariat (IS) located in Heidelberg (Germany) and Geneva (Switzerland), and coordinated by the Secretary General.

'''FIAN International's work'''

FIAN uses various working tools to achieve the realization of the right to adequate food.

'''''Case-work and Interventions'''''

At international Fact Finding Missions, FIAN identifies and addresses human rights violations. FIAN interviews people threatened or affected by violations of their right to food and verifies the facts of a situation. Face-to-face contacts to local counterparts are established and serve as a basis for trustful co-operation. On request of those affected, FIAN reacts quickly, analyses the case and mobilises members and supporters worldwide to send out Urgent Action protest letters. Violations are also followed-up in long-term case-work by local FIAN action groups. In close co-operation with the affected communities, FIAN persistently approaches the responsible authorities and identifies breaches of right to food obligations. FIAN’s analysis is based on the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] as interpreted in the UN General Comments, in particular General Comment 12 on the right to adequate food. Existing recourse mechanisms and legal remedies under national and international human rights law are applied to provide redress to the victims.

'''''Lobby and Advocacy'''''

Reliable contacts and networks, a sound documentation of cases and two decades of experience provide a solid basis for effective lobbying and advocating the right to food. FIAN holds states, international institutions and private actors accountable at the national and international levels. The Right to Food Guidelines adopted by the [[FAO]] in 2004 is one of the tools FIAN uses to monitor states’ right to food policies. FIAN tries to improve the existing right to food protection system and to establish new instruments. Intense follow-up work strives to secure the effective implementation of existing instruments, making the right to food politically and judicially enforceable everywhere for everyone.

'''''Information and Education'''''

Targeted information campaigns and awareness-raising on the right to food are at the core of FIAN’s work - to empower social movements and non-governmental organizations to hold states accountable for violations of the right to food, to clarify for governments and other duty-bearers the content and implementation needs of their obligations, and to motivate supporters from civil society to join action against human rights violations. The systematic information gathered from more than 400 individual cases over the past two decades is analyzed and fed into various professional publications.

'''Impact'''

FIAN was involved prominently in the development of the human rights protection system, for instance in the strengthened procedure of State’s and parallel reporting on economic, social, and cultural human rights in the UN human rights system; the elaboration of the UN General Comment No. 12 on the Right to Food in 1999 as the most authoritative legal interpretation of the right to food in international law; and the adoption of the “Voluntary Guidelines on the Right to Food” by the FAO member states in 2004.

'''''FIAN’s commitment was awarded internationally:'''''

'''Public Eye on Davos - Positive Award:''' In 2006, FIAN International together with two partners won the Public Eye on Davos - Positive Award, which is given every year on the occasion of the World Economic Forum in Davos, for their commitment in favour of the rights of workers of the Mexican tyre factory Euzkadi.

'''Silver Rose Award:''' In 2005, two staff members of the FIAN Section Germany received the Silver Rose Award for their commitment for the rights of workers in the flower industry, the participation in the development of the International Code of Conduct for the Production of Cut flowers (ICC) and its successful implementation in the framework of the Flower Label Programm (FLP).

On June 2, 2012, '''Feng Jianmei''' ({{zh|s=冯建梅|p=Féng Jiànméi}}) was [[Forced abortion|forced to have an abortion]] in [[Zhenping County, Shaanxi|Zhenping County]], [[Shaanxi]], [[China]], when she was seven months pregnant with her second child. Local officials had demanded that Feng and her husband pay a 40,000 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] fine for violating the nation's [[one-child policy]].  When they were unable to do so, authorities arrested Feng, made her sign an agreement to have an abortion, and held her down while injecting her with an [[abortifacient]].  Feng was reportedly traumatized by the incident and in poor health afterwards.

On June 11, Feng's family posted graphic pictures of her stillborn child. The images soon became a [[viral phenomenon]], sparking controversy within China and drawing international attention to the issue of forced abortions. In response to national and international attention, the Chinese government launched an investigation.  On June 26, the investigation determined that Feng was not legally entitled to a second child, but that her rights had nonetheless been violated by the local family planning bureau, and as a result, two officials were fired and five others punished.  On June 27, the [[National Population and Family Planning Commission]] announced it would send inspection teams across China to review the practices of local family planning divisions.  Feng's husband, Deng Jiyuan ({{zh|s=邓吉元|p=Dèng Jíyuán|links=no}}), hired a lawyer to pursue criminal charges, but ultimately the family decided to settle out of court.

The incident led to increased scrutiny of China's one-child policy, both nationally and internationally. Feng's case has been cited in editorials critical of the one-child policy, and has also been used as an example of how the Internet is empowering ordinary people in an environment of government censorship.  On July 5, [[European Parliament]] passed a resolution condemning both Feng's case and forced abortion in general. On January 1, 2016, after months of discussion, China's one-child policy was replaced with a [[two-child policy]].

==Background==
===One-child law===
{{see also|one-child policy|abortion in China}}
Since 1979, Chinese couples have been limited to one child by law in order to control the country's population.  Families living in rural areas, as well as those with an [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minority background]], can often receive an exemption from the law and have a second child without penalty.  Otherwise, couples who have two or more children are required to pay a fine to the government.  According to He Yafu, an independent [[demographer]], such fines are common and "have become a major source of profit for family planning authorities" in recent years.&lt;ref name=fury /&gt; The demographer He adds that the fines allow wealthy families to have extra children while forcing poorer families into involuntary abortions.&lt;ref name=fury /&gt;  The fines generate an estimated 20 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] per year in revenue for the government.&lt;ref name=fury /&gt;  He Yafu estimates that over 2 trillion yuan (~$314 billion USD) has been collected since 1980.&lt;ref name=brutal /&gt;

China's Population and Family Planning Law prohibits infringement on people's personal rights and property for family planning purposes.&lt;ref name=fury /&gt;  Moreover, a 2001 law prohibited abortions after the sixth month of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=sparks /&gt; Nevertheless, human rights groups and critics of the one-child policy say that these laws are inconsistently enforced, and the local officials in many areas still carry out forced sterilizations and/or coerced abortions, sometimes in the third trimester after the fetus has reached [[Fetus#Viability|viability]].&lt;ref name=fury /&gt;&lt;ref name=sparks /&gt;&lt;ref name=CECC&gt;Congressional-Executive Commission on China, [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110hhrg45233/pdf/CHRG-110hhrg45233.pdf 2008 Annual Report], 31 October 2008, p 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In ten Chinese provinces, including Shaanxi, authorities are permitted to take "remedial measures" to ensure that birth quotas are not exceeded. In eight other provinces, authorities are required to terminate unauthorized pregnancies.&lt;ref name=CECC/&gt; Activists such as [[Chen Guangcheng]] have been jailed by the Chinese government for bringing to light evidence of forced abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chinese to Prosecute Peasant Who Resisted One-Child Policy |work=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/07/AR2006070701510.html |date=8 July 2006 |author=Philip P. Pan |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Chen filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of women forced into [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] or abortions and subsequently spent seven years in jail or under house arrest before emigrating to the United States in 2012.&lt;ref name=suspends&gt;{{cite news|title=China Says It Suspended Officials in Forced-Abortion Case|author=Josh Chin|author2=Olivia Geng|date=June 15, 2012|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303410404577468170016159682|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feng Jianmei===
In October 2011, Feng Jianmei, who was a 22-year-old woman from the small village of Yuping in Zeng Jia Township, [[Shaanxi]] province, became pregnant with her second child.&lt;ref name=fury&gt;{{cite news|title=Fury over 'forced abortion'|author=Yan Shuang|date=June 14, 2012|work=Global Times|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/714855.shtml|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pressure /&gt;  She had married in 2006 and given birth to a girl in 2007.&lt;ref name=mature&gt;{{cite news|title=Mom allegedly forced to abort mature fetus|work=Shanghai Daily|date=June 14, 2012|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/?id=503694&amp;type=National|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After listening to the advice of relatives, Feng and her husband, Deng Jiyuan, had believed they would be allowed to have a second child since they had waited five years between children and lived in a rural area.&lt;ref name=ChinaNet&gt;{{cite news|script-title=zh:陕西孕妇被引产调查|author=Jiang Yue|author2=Lei Ying|work=ChinaNet|date=June 19, 2012|publisher=21cbh.com|url=http://www.21cbh.com/HTML/2012-6-19/0NNTg3XzQ1NzA0Nw.html|accessdate=July 26, 2012|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624024046/http://www.21cbh.com/HTML/2012-6-19/0NNTg3XzQ1NzA0Nw.html|archivedate=June 24, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Zhenping County, Shaanxi|Zhenping County]] officials, authorities had contacted Feng in March 2012 and told her that she needed to obtain documentation, including a new [[Hukou system|household registration]] (referred to as ''hukou''), in order to file an application to have the child.&lt;ref name=fury /&gt;&lt;ref name=form&gt;{{cite news|title=A forced abortion for a mother who failed to sign a form|author=Malcolm Moore|date=June 14, 2012|work=The Telegraph|publisher=The Age|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/a-forced-abortion-for-a-mother-who-failed-to-sign-a-form-20120615-20eu6.html|accessdate=June 24, 2012|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family denies this, saying that officials did not notify them until several days before the abortion was induced.&lt;ref name=fury /&gt;

==Abortion==

Around May 28, local family planning officials phoned Feng to try to persuade her to have an abortion.&lt;ref name=ChinaNet /&gt; The attempt was unsuccessful, so on May 30 they visited the family house while Feng's husband was away at work.  At first, authorities tried to persuade her to voluntarily have an abortion.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt; After several hours, she told the officials she was going out to buy food, and left them in her living room.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt; Instead, she went to an aunt's house, but around 15 officials followed her.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt; They did not immediately arrest Feng, instead setting up shifts to keep watch over her at the aunt's house.  Early the next morning, Feng escaped, causing the guards to panic.&lt;ref name=ChinaNet /&gt;  She flagged down a van and persuaded the driver to help her.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt;  The driver let her out down the road, and Feng hid in hillside brush for the next 14 hours, waiting for the cover of darkness in the cold and rainy weather.&lt;ref name=ChinaNet /&gt;&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt;  When night came, she went to a relative's house in the countryside, where she hid under the bed.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt; Authorities from the family planning office found her regardless, and allegedly assaulted her.&lt;ref name=brutal /&gt;&lt;ref name=WRWF /&gt;  They let her get a night's sleep before taking her to the hospital on June 2. Several witnesses reported that four men carried Feng out of the house with a pillowcase over her head.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt;

Simultaneously, family planning officials were in communication with Feng's husband, Deng Jiyuan.  On June 1, they demanded that Deng either transfer his wife's residency status on the next day or pay 100,000 yuan (US$15,700) to the birth-planning social security fund.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt;  Transferring the residency status in one day was impossible, but Deng negotiated the payment down to 30,000 yuan before returning to Zhenping County (he actually only had 18,000 yuan that he had borrowed from work, but hoped an [[IOU]] would cover the balance).&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt;  On his way back, Deng received a [[text message]] that demanded that he immediately pay the fee, which was now 40,000 yuan, and "not a penny less".&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt; Other family members received similar text messages.&lt;ref name=fury /&gt;[[File:Feng Jianmei.jpg|thumb|A [[pixelation|censored]] image of Feng, posted on Sina Weibo by her family &lt;!-- An unobscured version is available under [[#External links|external links]] --&gt;|alt=A woman lies on a bed, staring blankly; next to her is a bloody baby that is partially obscured by computerized blurring]]

At the hospital, two men forced Feng to apply her thumbprint to a consent form and sign a document authorizing the abortion.&lt;ref name="fury" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sparks"&gt;{{cite news|title=China forced abortion photo sparks outrage|work=BBC News|date=June 14, 2012|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-18435126|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="addiction" /&gt;  She was taken into an operating room and restrained by two men as she was injected with a poison to kill the fetus.&lt;ref name="fury" /&gt;&lt;ref name="addiction" /&gt; Feng later told [[All Girls Allowed]], an American group campaigning against the one-child policy, "I could feel the baby jumping around inside me all the time, but then she went still."&lt;ref name="form" /&gt; She had been seven months pregnant at the time, so the abortion, voluntary or not, was illegal under Chinese law.&lt;ref name="sparks" /&gt; No family members were allowed to be present for the procedure.&lt;ref name="mature" /&gt; After the child died of [[Intrauterine hypoxia|hypoxia]], Feng underwent induced labor and delivered a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] girl on June 4.&lt;ref name="mature" /&gt; Feng later told All Girls Allowed: "It was much more painful than my first childbirth. The baby was lifeless, and she was all purple and blue."&lt;ref name="AGA"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Officials forcibly abort the baby of Feng Jianmei, who was 7 months pregnant|publisher=All Girls Allowed|date=June 12, 2012|url=http://www.allgirlsallowed.org/forced-abortion-shocks-international-community|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The corpse was then placed next to Feng on her bed for her family to dispose of when they arrived.&lt;ref name="addiction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gruesome" /&gt;

Feng was traumatized by the procedure and smashed the door and cabinetry of a nurse's office in a fit of rage.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt;  A week later, Deng told ''The [[South China Morning Post]]'', "My wife is not well. She is sad and distressed. Sometimes she becomes emotional and confused."&lt;ref name=SCMP /&gt;  Feng reportedly had a severe headache for several weeks after the abortion and attempted suicide multiple times.&lt;ref name=AGA /&gt; On June 15, an uncle told reporters Feng was in poor health and unable to eat.&lt;ref name=suspends /&gt;  On June 26, Feng was still in the hospital and suffering from headaches.&lt;ref name=pressure /&gt;  She told reporters that she wanted to go home, but that hospital staff would not allow her to leave.  On June 29, her family reported that Feng would be released the next day.&lt;ref name=resurfaces /&gt;  However, her condition worsened, and she did not return home until July 10.&lt;ref name=settlement&gt;{{cite news|title=China Settles Over Forced Abortion|author=Josh Chin|date=July 11, 2012|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303567704577519914257120978|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deng filed an official complaint with [[Ankang]]'s petition office.&lt;ref name=SCMP /&gt;  A deputy mayor allegedly told Deng that they would investigate, but when nothing appeared to be happening, Deng posted his family's story online.&lt;ref name=SCMP /&gt; later telling CNN that "I'm angry and want justice."&lt;ref name=outrage /&gt;  Meanwhile, the township officials had prepared a statement that said Feng was of sound mind and body when she signed the consent form authorizing the abortion.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Story goes viral===
Feng's sister-in-law and Deng Jiyuan's sister, Deng Jicai ({{zh|s=邓吉彩|p=Dèng Jícǎi|links=no}}), came back from [[Hubei]] the day after the abortion and brought a video camera with her to film Feng.  A family planning official, who discovered the tape, then demanded that it be erased.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt;  However, Jicai was able to capture several pictures with her cell phone.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt; On June 11, a picture of Feng lying in a hospital bed "staring at the ceiling with dull eyes" next to the bloody corpse was posted on Chinese [[social media]] website [[Sina Weibo]], along with an image of a threatening text message sent by authorities.&lt;ref name=mature /&gt;&lt;ref name=form /&gt; The images prompted outrage, and news of the event spread quickly.&lt;ref name=sparks /&gt;  Angry comments from around China poured in, with people calling the authorities' actions "an atrocity", "the same as murder."&lt;ref name=mature /&gt;&lt;ref name=SCMP /&gt;  Many comments called for an end to the one-child policy, or tied the case to other controversial topics such as the corruption of local officials or the country's rural-urban divide.&lt;ref name=brutal /&gt;&lt;ref name=caught /&gt;  Many posts were quickly deleted by government censors.&lt;ref name=gruesome&gt;{{cite news|title=Gruesome photos put spotlight on China's one-child policy|author=Bo Gu|work=NBC News|date=June 14, 2012|url=http://behindthewall.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/14/12222877-gruesome-photos-put-spotlight-on-chinas-one-child-policy|accessdate=June 24, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617042544/http://behindthewall.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/14/12222877-gruesome-photos-put-spotlight-on-chinas-one-child-policy|archivedate=June 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, by June 13, more than 40,000 comments about the photos were present on Sina Weibo, and by June 15, images of Feng were among the most forwarded. "Seven-months pregnant forced abortion" was the website's top search term, and more than one million user comments were logged on the topic.&lt;ref name=suspends /&gt;&lt;ref name=forced&gt;{{cite news|title=

[[Zhang Kai (lawyer)|Zhang Kai]] ({{zh|s=张凯|p=Zhāng Kǎi|links=no}}), a lawyer known for his representation of the disadvantaged, posted the story on his blog.&lt;ref name=fury /&gt;  [[Li Chengpeng]], a Chinese blogger with at the time more than five million followers, learned of the story and wrote "the purpose of family planning was to control population, but now it has become murder population&amp;nbsp;...  If this evil policy is not stopped, this country will have no humanity."&lt;ref name=gruesome/&gt; Zhao Chu, a writer decried the one-child policy as a "profit-oriented activity that everyone hates", writing "this is not about enforcing the policy, it is about depriving someone’s right to live".&lt;ref name=gruesome/&gt;&lt;ref name=caught /&gt; [[Liang Jianzhang]], chief executive of [[Ctrip]], called Feng's case "outrageous and violent" and "not unique to Shaanxi",&lt;ref name=brutal /&gt; saying that "abolition of the absurd family-planning policy is the only way to root out this kind of evil".&lt;ref name=brutal /&gt;

Local newspaper ''Hua Shang Bao'' ran a story on Feng.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt;On June 12, human rights activist [[Huang Qi]] also posted the story and images.&lt;ref name=WRWF&gt;{{cite web|title=BREAKING: (Warning, graphic image) Chinese Woman Forcibly Aborted at Seven Months|author=Reggie Littlejohn|date=June 12, 2012|url=http://www.womensrightswithoutfrontiers.org/blog/?p=667|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story was then picked up by major media outlets throughout China.&lt;ref name=reported&gt;{{cite news|title=Forced Abortions Reported|work=Radio Free Asia|date=June 12, 2012|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/forced-abortion-06122012121318.html|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 14, state-backed newspaper ''[[Global Times]]'' reported that "online posts about Feng's forced abortion had triggered a torrent of criticism directed at the Zhenping government and sparked debate about the national family planning policy".&lt;ref name=fury /&gt;  On his personal Weibo account, chief editor [[Hu Xijin]] wrote, "I strongly oppose the barbarous forced abortion", saying the country's family planning enforcement needed to change.&lt;ref name=brutal /&gt;  However, he stated that overall the one-child policy was a good thing, writing that "the world resources cannot afford to feed a China with billions of people".&lt;ref name=brutal /&gt;

On June 13, French news agency [[Agence France-Presse]] reported that the graphic images of Feng and her stillborn child "have caused an uproar in China".&lt;ref name=uproar&gt;Agence France-Presse (June 13, 2012), "[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/297903/forced-abortion-picture-causes-uproar-in-china Forced abortion' picture causes uproar in China]", Retrieved October 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Jazeera]] also ran a story about Feng that day.&lt;ref name=forced /&gt; The next day, [[BBC]], [[CNN]], ''[[The Age]]'', and other major media outlets around the world ran articles on the topic.&lt;ref name=sparks /&gt;&lt;ref name=form /&gt;&lt;ref name=outrage /&gt;

===Chinese government response===
After the story of Feng Jianmei's abortion gained widespread domestic and international exposure, Zhenping County officials denied the allegations, saying that the abortion was legal and that Feng had requested it.&lt;ref name=fury /&gt;  "Feng agreed to go through an operation to end the pregnancy on June 2 following repeated mediation by the township officials", read the county's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese authorities force abortion in Shaanxi Province: report|agency=Japan Economic Newswire|date=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They further stated that she did not have a local ''hukou'' registration and that the couple was not entitled to a second child.&lt;ref name=fury /&gt;  The statement was later removed, with a search for Feng's name causing an "error" message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How China's Forced Abortion Policy Hits Two Women|author=Gloria Riviera|date=June 14, 2012|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/chinas-forced-abortions-child-rule-hits-women/story?id=16558428#.T-it4ZG8jbz|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few days later, local family planning official Yuan Fang stated the request for 40,000 yuan was "a deposit" that would have been returned after Feng filed the necessary paperwork.&lt;ref name=form /&gt;

A hospital employee acknowledged that Feng was staying there and that the hospital "implements" family planning policy and "provides services" to that effect, but denied that forced abortion was a part of what they do.&lt;ref name=reported /&gt;  He said he didn't know the details of Feng's case but stated that "she is probably just exaggerating things on the Internet".&lt;ref name=reported /&gt; It was soon revealed that the Zeng Jia Township had failed to reach its enforcement quotas under the one-child policy for the past two years, so it had received a "yellow card" warning.&lt;ref name=form /&gt;&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt;  Desiring to remove the warning, town officials decided to crack down on enforcement in June 2012.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt;

Approximately ten days after the forced abortion occurred, the Shaanxi Provincial Population and Family Planning Commission launched an investigation.&lt;ref name=fury /&gt;  On June 13, Yu Yanmei, the deputy head of Ankang, visited the Deng household.&lt;ref name=form /&gt;  Two days later, the commission concluded that Feng had indeed been forced into an illegal abortion,&lt;ref name=sparks /&gt; writing, "Such practice has seriously violated the relevant policies&amp;nbsp;... harmed the image of our family planning work, and caused extremely poor effects in society."&lt;ref name=sparks /&gt;  Three officials, including the head of the local family-planning department, were suspended from their jobs on June 14.&lt;ref name=suspends /&gt; An employee of the Ankang Family Planning Bureau said that "grass-roots comrades aren't stupid, but this is what they're forced to do&amp;nbsp;... This is a problem with the entire system."&lt;ref name=suspends /&gt;

The Ankang city government promised to "pursue strict legal and disciplinary action" once the investigation was finished.&lt;ref name=suspends /&gt;  On June 14, the city issued a formal apology. "Since the illegal actions by some officials have seriously hurt Feng Jianmei and her family, we want to offer our deep apologies to them and to the generic public", read the statement.&lt;ref name=outrage&gt;{{cite news|title=Forced abortion sparks outrage, debate in China|author=Steven Jiang|date=June 14, 2012|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/14/world/asia/china-abortion/index.html|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same day, deputy mayor Du Shouping visited Feng in the hospital to express the city's "sincere apologies."&lt;ref name=suspends /&gt;  "I hope we can earn your forgiveness," he said in a statement published on the city's webpage.&lt;ref name=suspends /&gt; The Chinese government also said it had released a pamphlet emphasizing that [[late termination of pregnancy|late term abortion]] is prohibited and that the legal rights of pregnant women should be maintained.&lt;ref name=SCMP&gt;{{cite news|title=Late-term abortion forced on woman|author=Zhuang Pinghui|date=June 14, 2012|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, the results of the investigation were announced.  The investigation concluded that Feng was not entitled to have a second child due to her non-agricultural hukou, and that she had been told to fix her registration in March.&lt;ref name=punished&gt;{{cite news|title=Officials punished for NW China forced abortion|agency=Xinhua|work=China Daily|date=June 27, 2012|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-06/27/content_15524501.htm|accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Feng's rights were violated by county officials and there was no legal basis for the demanded 40,000 yuan fee.&lt;ref name=punished /&gt;  "The incident showed that some officials at the grassroots level have a weak sense of the law and show little concern for the well-being of the people", the report said.&lt;ref name=sacks&gt;{{cite news|title=China sacks officials in forced abortion case|author=Tania Branigan|date=June 27, 2012|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/27/china-sacks-officials-forced-abortion|accessdate=June 27, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The head of the family planning bureau of Zhenping, Jiang Nenghai, and one other official were fired.&lt;ref name=pressure /&gt;&lt;ref name=punished /&gt; Five other government and hospital employees received some form of punishment.&lt;ref name=pressure&gt;{{cite news|title=Forced to Abort, Chinese Woman Under Pressure|author=Edward Wong|date=June 26, 2012|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/world/asia/chinese-family-in-forced-abortion-case-still-under-pressure.html|accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the county government was ordered to provide Feng with a living stipend.&lt;ref name=pressure /&gt;

Zhang Kai, a lawyer from Beijing, told Deng Jiyuan he would look into filing a lawsuit against the township government.&lt;ref name=SCMP /&gt;  "To force a woman who is seven months pregnant to have an abortion is a serious violation of the law," he said. "At the very least it should be considered willful and malicious injury."  Zhang said he hoped the case would cause people to rethink China's population control policies.&lt;ref name=suspends /&gt;  On June 29, he announced that he was officially representing the family and would seek the help of other lawyers to get the case heard in criminal court.  However, he acknowledged that doing so would be difficult.  "China's family planning departments are above the law," he explained. "Even when they do something illegal it is rare for them to be held responsible."&lt;ref name=resurfaces /&gt;&lt;ref name=sue&gt;{{cite news|title=Forced Abortion Father to Sue|date=June 29, 2012|work=Radio Free Asia|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/lawsuit-06292012112222.html|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the lawsuit threats, local officials cancelled a planned meeting to discuss the living stipend, saying they would wait for Jiyuan's return to Zeng Jia Township.&lt;ref name=sue /&gt;

Judge Xie Xue told reporters that forced abortion would not be classified as [[homicide]] or [[kidnapping]], but could qualify as an intentional injury crime.  In cases where complications arose after the abortion, such as Feng's, the injury could be considered a serious offense bearing a possible penalty of three to ten years in prison.&lt;ref name=inspection /&gt;  However, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said a legal remedy was unlikely, noting that a 2008 decision by the [[Supreme People's Court]] indicated that litigation could not be based on specific provisions of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]].  Furthermore, family planning law does not have any provision for damages awarded to victims of abuse by government officials.&lt;ref name=fewoptions&gt;{{cite news|title=The Law on Forced Abortion in China: Few Options for Victims|date=July 4, 2012|work=The Wall Street Journal|author=Stanley Lubman|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/07/04/the-law-on-forced-abortion-in-china-few-options-for-victims/|accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, Zhang submitted an official request for the Ankang police to file a case and investigate the officials involved.&lt;ref name=deal&gt;{{cite news|title=Forced abortion case ends as deal reached|author=Yan Shuang|date=July 11, 2012|work=Global Times|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/720323.shtml|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, Deng returned home and decided to negotiate with local authorities.  On July 10, the family agreed to settle out of court for 70,600 yuan (~$11,200 USD). Additionally, the township agreed to pay Feng's medical bills if she contracted a disease from the abortion.&lt;ref name=deal /&gt;  "I've given up legal appeals and agreed to take the compensation offered by the township government," Deng remarked. "We just want our normal life back."&lt;ref name=deal /&gt;  He added, "It has never been about the money. As ordinary people, we can no longer take the pressure from all sides of the society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China pays for forced abortion|agency=Associated Press|work=The Province|date=July 12, 2012|url=https://theprovince.com/news/China+pays+forced+abortion/6921788/story.html|accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zhang said the family gave up on pursuing criminal charges because local law enforcement was uncooperative, explaining that "if the prosecutors don't fulfill their responsibilities [to press charges], it's impossible to do."&lt;ref name=settlement /&gt;  An official told [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]], China's official state news agency, that the government was committed to providing for the family's financial needs if they should encounter future financial difficulties and that the government would also provide medical care for the Dengs' ailing mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forced abortion case settled after family is paid|agency=Xinhua|work=China Daily|date=July 11, 2012|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-07/11/content_15569665.htm|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang said the compensation could not make up for a lifetime of "spiritual pain" and remarked that 70,000 yuan could not compensate for a lost life.&lt;ref&gt;Agence France-Presse, (July 11, 2012), "[http://www.news.com.au/world/women-gets-11k-for-late-abortion/story-fndir2ev-1226423929239 Chinese woman compensated for forced late abortion]".

===Harassment and surveillance of family members===
In the weeks after Feng Jianmei's story went public, the family suffered from what Zhang called "state-backed harassment."&lt;ref name=harassment&gt;{{cite news|title=China forced-abortion woman suffering state harassment, lawyer says|author=Tania Branigan|date=June 26, 2012|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/26/china-forced-abortion-woman-feng?newsfeed=true|accessdate=June 26, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The harassment started when Deng Jiyuan attempted to go to [[Beijing]] to talk with a lawyer and do a television interview.&lt;ref name=pressure /&gt;&lt;ref name=missing&gt;{{cite news|title=Forced-abortion case husband goes missing|author=Zhuang Pinghui|work=South China Morning Post|date=June 26, 2012|page=1|url=http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2c913216495213d5df646910cba0a0a0|accessdate=June 26, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jiyuan's travel attempt was stopped by "more than 100 people and a dozen cars," according to Deng Jicai.

Retrieved October 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; After Jiyuan was interviewed by [[Stern (magazine)|''Stern'' magazine]] on June 22, the harassment from the government became worse,&lt;ref name=missing /&gt; with Jiyuan stating that he was subsequently followed by "local officials and thugs" everywhere he went, even the bathroom.&lt;ref name=missing /&gt; He then disappeared from public sight on June 24, only phoning home on June 26 to say he was safe, but his whereabouts remained unknown.&lt;ref name=harassment /&gt;

On June 29, Jiyuan reappeared in Beijing, telling reporters, "I came to Beijing in search of help."&lt;ref name=resurfaces&gt;{{cite news|title=Father in One-Child Saga Resurfaces in Beijing|author=Josh Chin|work=Wall Street Journal|date=June 29, 2012|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304830704577496550834930224|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he had made two unsuccessful attempts to flee from custody before succeeding on his third try.&lt;ref name=escape&gt;{{cite news|title=Husband of forced abortion victim tells of his escape from Chinese officials|author=Malcolm Moore|date=July 1, 2012|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/cambodia/9368131/Husband-of-forced-abortion-victim-tells-of-his-escape-from-Chinese-officials.html|accessdate=July 2, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his official monitors were on the phone, Jiyuan fled to a friend's home, where he remained for two days. He removed the [[subscriber identity module|sim card]] and battery from his cell phone to prevent being tracked.  "I did not sleep or get any new clothes, I could not risk being arrested," he recalled.&lt;ref name=escape /&gt; They rented a car and drove to Beijing, and Jiyuan recalled that "I assumed there would be government people at the train station."&lt;ref name=escape /&gt; Whenever they neared police officers, he would get out of the car and walk to prevent being spotted.&lt;ref name=escape /&gt;

Other family members were also reportedly followed and harassed by government officials. Protestors converged outside the hospital where Feng was staying, carrying a banner that read "severely beat the traitors and expel them."&lt;ref name=harassed /&gt;  Local media reported that the local government had organized the protest.&lt;ref name=resurfaces /&gt;  About a dozen guards patrolled outside Feng's hospital room for two weeks, following family members wherever they went.&lt;ref name=harassed /&gt; "We feel like prisoners," remarked Deng Jicai.&lt;ref name=missing /&gt;  Supporters of the family allege that local officials were also engaged in an online smear campaign against the family.&lt;ref name=harassment /&gt;  "The whole family feels very depressed and pressured," said Jicai.&lt;ref name=harassment /&gt;  On June 26, a visiting family member had their tires slashed.&lt;ref name=harassment /&gt;  A spokesperson for the Shaanxi provincial government called the allegations of harassment unfounded rumors.&lt;ref name=harassment /&gt;  However, Liang Zhongtang, an independent researcher, said it was common for people who seek outside help to be harassed by local governments. He speculated that the township government was trying to prevent further media coverage of the case.&lt;ref name=harassed /&gt;  On July 13, Jiyuan said that he remained concerned over his family's future safety, noting: "There are rumors on the street that after this thing calms down, when people are not paying attention to us anymore, they [the officials who were punished for approving the abortion] will kill my family."&lt;ref name=promised /&gt;

Later, when asked if she still wanted to have another child, Feng told ''The New York Times'', "That depends on how my body recovers. Yes, if I can get my health back."&lt;ref name="pressure" /&gt;

==Domestic and international response==

===Official response and calls to reform in China===
On June 27, the [[National Population and Family Planning Commission]] announced it would conduct a review of family planning enforcement country-wide.  As part of the review, ten inspection teams would be sent to nineteen different [[Provinces of the People's Republic of China|provinces]] to review the practices of local offices,&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite news|title=Family Planning Authorities Order Review of Local Enforcement|author=Lin Yunshi|date=June 28, 2012|work=Caixin Online|url=http://english.caixin.com/2012-06-28/100405238.html|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the teams would be charged with settling disputes and would distribute [[Birth control|contraceptives]].&lt;ref name=review /&gt;  Commission director Wang Xia said the inspection was of great importance, remarking that "even slight carelessness in law enforcement [damages] the image of the Party and the country."&lt;ref name=inspection&gt;{{cite news|title=Abortion scandal prompts nationwide inspection|author=Liu Linlin|date=June 29, 2012|work=Global Times|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/717868.shtml|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xia said the review would aim to "strengthen the day-to-day management of services, avoid the use of violence and prevent abuses of administrative enforcement"; he placed a special emphasis on the "social maintenance fees" collected from policy violators.&lt;ref name=inspection /&gt;&lt;ref name=review /&gt;  Simultaneously, the commission declared that fines collected for future violations could no longer be spent at the local level, but instead would go into a general fund.&lt;ref name=review /&gt;  He Yafu described the campaign as an attempt by the commission to restore public trust that had been badly damaged by Feng's forced abortion.&lt;ref name=inspection /&gt;

On July 3, 2012, an open letter by three members of the Development Research Center of the State Council, a [[think tank]] that advises the Chinese ruling cabinet, was published in the group's newspaper, ''China Economic Times''.  In the letter they called for "adjustments" to be made to the one-child policy "as soon as possible".&lt;ref name=academics&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese academics urge end to one-child policy|author=Tom Phillips|work=The Telegraph|date=July 5, 2012|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9378679/Chinese-academics-urge-end-to-one-child-policy.html|accessdate=July 6, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group advised that "an opening up of the two-child option to all should be considered."&lt;ref name=think-tank /&gt;  Demographer Liang Zhongtang said the letter was likely the start of a gradual shift in policy, but that a sudden shift was very unlikely.&lt;ref name=academics /&gt;  Although there was no explicit mention of Feng Jianmei in the letter, multiple news sources drew a connection between the timing of the two events.&lt;ref name=academics /&gt;&lt;ref name=think-tank&gt;{{cite news|title=Think Tank Calls China to Adjust One-Child Policy|author=Josh Chin|date=July 3, 2012|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304211804577504360440496118|accessdate=July 6, 2012|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Evan Osnos]] said that "pressure for change of China’s one-child policy seems to be mounting" in the wake of Feng's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Children, No "Cults": Chinese Family Advertising|author=Evan Osnos|date=July 5, 2012|work=The New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2012/07/families-reject-cults.html|accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 5, a group of fifteen scholars released an own open letter to the [[National People's Congress]] arguing that change to family planning law was "imperative".&lt;ref name=deal /&gt;&lt;ref name=scholars&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese Scholars Call for Revision of One-Child Policy|author=Josh Chin|date=July 6, 2012|work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303962304577509062660508548|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The letter mentioned research indicating economic consequences of continuing the one-child policy, but focused on human rights issues, mentioning Feng by name. "Behind these incidents are clear limitations and defects in the nation's family planning laws," read the letter.&lt;ref name=scholars /&gt; Liang Jianzhang, one of the letter's signers, told a reporter "From an economic perspective, the one-child policy is irrational. From a human-rights perspective, it's even less rational."&lt;ref name=scholars /&gt;

===International reaction===
Feng Jianmei's ordeal brought increased scrutiny to China's abortion and population-control policies.  International commentators were highly critical of the government's role in Feng's abortion. "Feng Jianmei's story demonstrates how the One-Child Policy continues to sanction violence against women every day", said [[Chai Ling]] of the NGO All Girls Allowed.&lt;ref name=uproar /&gt;  Women's Rights Without Frontiers' president Reggie Littlejohn stated "no legitimate government would commit or tolerate such an act.  Those who are responsible should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity."&lt;ref name=WRWF /&gt;  In a press release, the Christian [[Alliance Defense Fund]] called Feng's case "nothing less than a crime against humanity" and asked American political leaders to formally condemn the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=ADF calls on U.S. leaders to condemn forced abortion atrocity in China|date=June 13, 2012|publisher=Alliance Defense Fund|url=http://www.adfmedia.org/News/PRDetail/5567|accessdate=June 24, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130223165436/http://www.adfmedia.org/News/PRDetail/5567|archivedate=February 23, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Evangelical Alliance]] said it was "outraged" by the incident and asked the Chinese government to "ensure that these tragic incidents are prevented from happening in the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=WEA Was Shocked by the Forced Abortion of a Baby at Seven Months in Shaanxi, China|publisher=World Evangelical Alliance|date=June 17, 2012|url=http://www.worldea.org/news/4032/the-world-evangelical-alliance-was-shocked-by-the-forced-abortion-of-a-baby-at-seven-months-in-shaanxi-china|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, [[European Parliament]] passed a resolution condemning both the treatment of Feng and forced abortions in general, "especially in the context of the one-child policy".&lt;ref name=EU&gt;{{cite news|title=EU Parliament condemns China forced abortions|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=July 6, 2012|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/224353/eu-parliament-condemns-china-forced-abortions|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resolution also requested that forced abortion be added the agenda for the next bilateral human rights dialogue with China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint motion for a resolution on the forced abortion scandal in China|date=July 4, 2012|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&amp;reference=P7-RC-2012-388&amp;language=EN|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some [[Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) requested an independent investigation into forced abortion and infanticide in China.&lt;ref name=EU /&gt; A few days later, MEP [[Lojze Peterle]] opined that Chinese family planning law violates provisions outlined by the [[United Nations]] in the [[International Conference on Population and Development]].  He said the resolution passed by parliament gives the [[European Commission]] a "clear mandate" to withdraw funds from any organization potentially involved in aiding coercive practices in China, citing the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] and [[Marie Stopes International]] as two potential targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese forced abortion 'inhuman and degrading'|author=Alojz Peterle|date=July 11, 2012|publisher=Public Service Europe|url=http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/2205/chinese-forced-abortion-inhuman-and-degrading|accessdate=July 11, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723060730/http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/2205/chinese-forced-abortion-inhuman-and-degrading|archivedate=July 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, the [[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations|Human Rights Subcommittee]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]] convened a hearing on the one-child policy prompted by Feng's story.  In his opening remarks, chairman [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] called the one-child policy "a nightmarish 'brave new world'&amp;nbsp;... where women are psychologically wounded, girls fall victim to [[sex-selective abortion]]&amp;nbsp;... and most children grow up without brothers or sisters, aunts or uncles or cousins".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forced Abortion at 7 Months of Feng Jianmei Sparks Global Outrage – and Concern|date=July 9, 2012|author=Chris Smith|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/UploadedFiles/2012-07-09_Continued_Human_Rights_Attacks_on_Families_in_China.pdf|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He said that because of Feng, people were "finally seeing the gruesome reality of China's one-child policy".&lt;ref name=newpressure&gt;{{cite news|title=Gruesome picture puts new pressure on China over one-child policy|author=Cheryl Wetzstein|work=Washington Times|date=July 9, 2012|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/9/gruesome-picture-puts-new-pressure-on-china-over-o/|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Congressman [[Joseph R.

===International media coverage===
Feng's case became a focal point for newspaper editorials against China's one-child policy and abortion in general. Opponents of the one-child policy said the case is a potential turning point in the efforts to end the rule.&lt;ref name=think-tank /&gt;  On June 26, [[Reuters]] said the story had sparked "a firestorm domestically and around the world",&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news|title=China sacks official, punishes others in forced abortion case|agency=Reuters|date=June 26, 2012|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-china-abortion-idUSBRE85Q02P20120627|accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; explaining, "Feng Jianmei's abortion was portrayed in the Chinese and international press as an example of the extreme measures some officials would take to control China's population, even if it meant breaking Chinese law."&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt; A story in ''The Wall Street Journal'' remarked that the case "dramatize[s] the harshness of the one-child policy."&lt;ref name=fewoptions /&gt;  The incident prompted Evan Osnos, the ''New Yorker'' writer'','' to create a feature piece titled "Abortion and Politics in China." Osnos said that "the Feng case is emblematic of some of the most inflammatory issues on Chinese public life", including money, government corruption, the household registration system, and of course family planning, and that "the case is a dramatic demonstration of exactly why the Communist Party had reason to be afraid of the Internet."&lt;ref name=NewYorker&gt;{{cite news|title=Abortion and Politics in China|author=Evan Osnos|date=June 15, 2012|work=The New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2012/06/abortion-and-politics-in-china.html|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, ''[[The Economist]]'' featured a story on China’s one-child policy, focusing on Feng's forced abortion and how the internet was changing power dynamics in China. "Three years ago, Ms. Feng's suffering might have gone unnoticed&amp;nbsp;... But her relatives uploaded the graphic pictures onto the internet, and soon microblogs had flashed them to millions of people across the country," writes the article's author.&lt;ref name=brutal&gt;{{cite news|title=The brutal truth|work=The Economist|date=June 23, 2012|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21557369|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wang Songlian, a researcher for [[Chinese Human Rights Defenders]], said it was certain that the internet had made discussion of Feng's case possible, but she called the officials' punishments "isolated" and said "government officials are virtually immune in using violence and carrying out the policy by force.  We've not seen any significant [change] in holding officials accountable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese officials who pushed woman into late-term abortion 'punished'|date=June 28, 2012|author=Daniel Bardsley|work=The National|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/chinese-officials-who-pushed-woman-into-late-term-abortion-punished|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A June 22 editorial in ''[[The Australian]]'' argued against the one-child policy, stating that Feng's case "one small example of the terrible costs of China's longstanding population control regime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China's one-child policy no 'solution' to climate change|author=Dan Ryan|date=June 22, 2012|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/chinas-one-child-policy-no-solution-to-climate-change/story-e6frg6ux-1226404756438|accessdate=June 25, 2012|subscription=yes|work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A June 25 editorial in the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', which examined family planning in general, said that Feng "personifies the end game of forced population limits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Family planning for the 21st century|author=Wendy Tuohy|work=Herald Sun|date=June 25, 2012|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/family-planning-for-the-21st-century/story-fnbdxfy6-1226406982683|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several commentators have compared Feng Jianmei to [[Liu Yang (astronaut)|Liu Yang]], who was in the news at roughly the same time for becoming the first Chinese female in space.  On June 17, the ''Tea Leaf Nation'' blog published a story entitled "Netizens Reflect As One Chinese Woman Touches Heaven, Another Hell".&lt;ref name=netizens&gt;{{cite web|title=Netizens Reflect As One Chinese Woman Touches Heaven, Another Hell|author=Liz Carter|work=Tea Leaf Nation|date=June 17, 2012|url=http://tealeafnation.com/2012/06/netizens-reflect-as-one-chinese-woman-touches-heaven-another-hell/|accessdate=June 25, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623133934/http://tealeafnation.com/2012/06/netizens-reflect-as-one-chinese-woman-touches-heaven-another-hell/|archivedate=June 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story, focused on a widely distributed Sina Weibo post, features pictures of Feng and Liu side by side, and the blogger wrote in the caption "The stark contrast between the fates of [the] two women&amp;nbsp;... is the clearest illustration of the torn state of this nation."&lt;ref name=netizens /&gt;  The post was quickly re-tweeted by famous blogger [[Han Han]]. By the time the government deleted both posts, the information had already been shared 70,000 times in the first 24 hours.&lt;ref name=netizens /&gt;  ''The [[International Herald Tribune]]'' immediately picked up the story, stating, "The gruesome abortion incident was cast this weekend against China’s successful launching of its first female astronaut. The sad irony of the two women’s situations was not lost on Chinese netizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Women and Two Trajectories in China|author=Mark McDonald|work=International Herald Tribune|date=June 17, 2012|url=http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/16/two-women-and-two-trajectories-in-china/|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, the ''Global Post'' published the story and commented, "leave it to Sina Weibo to point out what's important",&lt;ref name=astronauts&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese women: from astronauts to forced abortions|author=Emily Lodish|date=June 19, 2012|work=Global Post|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/chatter/china-chinese-women-astronauts-forced-abortions|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  explaining that the juxtaposition of the two new stories "[highlights] China's current troubled and contradictory state&amp;nbsp;... Some Chinese women get launched into space, others receive injections that kill their unborn child."&lt;ref name=astronauts /&gt;

Journalist [[Andrew Bolt]] used Feng's case to editorialize against abortion in Australia, writing, "Deng Jiyuan has shamed the tyrants of Beijing. But&amp;nbsp;... he shames us here as well."&lt;ref name=baby&gt;{{cite news|title=Baby, it's a crying shame|author=Andrew Bolt|date=June 18, 2012|work=Herald Sun|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/baby-its-a-crying-shame/story-e6frfhqf-1226398054333|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He compared Feng's abortion to famous cases in Australia and concluded that the main difference was the graphic pictures of Feng's baby.&lt;ref name=baby /&gt;

''[[Asia Times Online]]'' featured Feng's story in an editorial titled "China's addiction to birth planning".  Author Peter Lee remarked that it was "disturbing" how many resources the township devoted to persuading Feng, quoting an official as saying, "On that day, pretty much all of the township leadership and relevant staff all went [to get Feng to the hospital]."&lt;ref name=addiction&gt;{{cite news|title=China's addiction to birth planning|author=Peter Lee|work=Asia Times Online|date=June 26, 2012|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/NF27Ad01.html|accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that the way the case was handled provides strong evidence that at least some of China's leaders are anxious to end the one-child policy.&lt;ref name=addiction /&gt;  In contrast, an editorial published in ''[[The Peninsula (newspaper)|The Peninsula]]'' argued that the case showed China's leaders were losing their ability to control local authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Editorial: Headcount copping|date=June 29, 2012|work=The Peninsula|url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/qatar/199351-editorial-headcount-copping-.html|accessdate=June 30, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130204042008/http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/qatar/199351-editorial-headcount-copping-.html|archivedate=February 4, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He Yafu says the controversy has damaged the public image of one-child policy in China.&lt;ref name=brutal /&gt; Journalist [[Fareed Zakaria]] suggested there were signs that the Chinese government was softening its rules, noting the large number of prominent citizens who spoke out against Feng's abortion. Zakaria wrote, "Even a few years ago, it would have taken a very brave Chinese thinker to pose that question in public."&lt;ref name=change&gt;{{cite news|title=Could China's one-child policy change?|author=Fareed Zakaria|date=July 9, 2012|work=Fareed Zakaria GPS|publisher=CNN|url=http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/09/could-chinas-one-child-policy-change/|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he said that formal change would be impossible before a change in leadership occurred, and even then would "take much courage".&lt;ref name=change /&gt;

A July 17 piece in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' said that the case "captured the public imagination in China because it exemplifies broader systemic issues".&lt;ref name=caught&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese Villager Caught in US Abortion Debate|author=Julian Baird Gewirtz|author2=Rachel Kauder Nalebuff|date=July 17, 2012|work=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julian-baird-gewirtz/china-abortion_b_1672917.html|accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feng's case had been cited by both [[pro-life]] and [[pro-choice]] advocates in the United States in support of their causes; for pro-life advocates, the case represented "the kind of 'federally endorsed' abortions that they fear may lie in store for the United States",&lt;ref name=caught /&gt; while for pro-choice advocates, "[Feng] should have been granted a choice in the first place."&lt;ref name=caught /&gt;

{{update|date=May 2018}}

[[Home care|Home visiting]] programs for families with [[Early childhood|young children]] have received [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] support in the United States. A range of programs have been implemented, with evaluation of their effectiveness in terms of health, social and educational outcomes.

==History==
In 2010, the federal [[Affordable Care Act]] initiated the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program that allocates $1.5 billion over five years to states that voluntarily provide families with young children with evidence-based home visiting programs. It aims to establish a positive and improved outcome in health, education, and reduced [[child abuse]] in families. Home visiting has already been in practice in every state.&lt;ref name="ncsl_a"&gt;Tweedle, Mark. National Conference of State Legislature. [http://www.ncsl.org/documents/cyf/HomeVisitingPPT.pdf Home Visiting Power Point]. Retrieved Oct 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of enactment==
The purpose of federal funding is to identify the most effective early childhood home visiting programs and strengthen them with standards that will produce measurable and efficient outcomes. As of October 2013, 17 states have introduced 32 bills on Home Visiting Programs before legislature. Beginning September 2010, the Department of [[Health and Human Services]] (HHS) awarded grants to states to develop and implement an early childhood home visitation program to promote.&lt;ref name="ncsl_b"&gt;National Conference of State Legislature. [http://www.ncsl.org/documents/health/NCSLVisitGrants.pdf NCSL Fact Sheet on Health Reform. Grants for Early Childhood Home Visitation programs]. Retrieved Oct 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
1.	Improvements in maternal and prenatal health,
2.	Infant health,
3.	Child health and development,
4.	Parenting related to child development outcomes, and
5.	School readiness in child abuse, neglect and injuries.

==Programs==
Several national Home Visiting Programs have developed and attained standards for successful training and home visiting cases for home visitors as well as for the program supervisors. States and local programs may use these models to establish a program but some local programs also may customize and tailor their programs according to their local needs by utilizing local resources and institutions. Local programs may follow some of elements from the national programs and integrate them, which create varieties of practice models, depending on the needs and availability of the local communities. The local models may not have evidence of consistent outcomes.

The seven federally approved home visiting models are:
# Early Head Start – Home Based Option&lt;ref&gt;[http://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/hslc/tta-system/ehsnrc/Early%20Head%20Start/home-based-model Head Start], Early Childhood Learning &amp; Knowledge Center, HHS.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Family Check Up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/document.aspx?rid=1&amp;sid=9|title=HomVEE - Family Check-Up® For Children - In Brief|website=homvee.acf.hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Healthy Families America (HFA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthyfamiliesamerica.org/home/index.shtml Healthy Families America]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Healthy Steps&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthysteps.org HealthySteps]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Home Instruction Programs for Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hippyusa.org|title=Home - HIPPY USA|website=www.hippyusa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nursefamilypartnership.org|title=Nurse-Family Partnership – Helping First-Time Parents Succeed|website=Nurse-Family Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Parents as Teachers (PAT)&lt;ref&gt;[https://parentsasteachers.org/resources/federal-home-visiting-program Parents as Teachers]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other programs also in review for federal approval. When states apply and are granted of the federal funds, federal legislation provides guidelines on how to specifically distribute the money. For example, at least 75% of the funds must be apportioned on programs that follow one of the approved home visiting models. The rest of the money may be allocated for “promising approaches”, where they have shown some evidence of effectiveness, but yet to have strong assessment of evidence. Local programs may apply for funding in this classification.&lt;ref name="ncsl"&gt;National Conference of State Legislatures.

==Implementation==

===Home visitors===
Home visitors are trained professionals who focus on early childhood and maternal health; they may be nurses, social workers, or early childhood specialists with additional training. Their scope of practice includes children and maternal health, parenting and family education, child abuse and neglect. Home visitors provide education and resources to parents in multiple layers, such as educating on normal trajectory of early childhood, identifying abnormal development or modifying problematic behavior, offering referrals to community resources, such as [[Medicaid]], job training, employment services, or food assistance. They also provide mental health counseling to parents who may have substance abuse problems, or maternal depression.

===Target===
Home visiting services aim to support families who are most disadvantaged, or at risk. This population includes first time parents, low-income parents, single or teen parents, as well as parents with substance abuse or addictions, or mental health issues such as maternal depression.

==Benefit==

===Evidence-based practices===
[[Evidence-based practice]] means that there has been a set of standards of practices established from clinically proved trials and researches that produced consistently improved outcomes. Individual clinician’s training and organizational and systems changes could influence the implementation of clinical guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Glanz, K., Rimer, B.K., Viswanath, K. (Eds.) (2008). Health Behavior and Health Education (4th edition). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. Chapter 14, Diffusion of Innovations (pp 313–334).&lt;/ref&gt; The review of home visiting programs reports that intensive and frequent visits from trained professionals to families from the prenatal stage up to the second or third years of the child’s life produces a positive and improved outcome in maternal and child’s health. The frequency could be as often once a week to at least once or twice every month in the beginning stage of home visits.&lt;ref name="ncsl" /&gt;

===Evidence===
Quality practices offered by well-trained home visitors in Home Visiting Programs have been shown to be effective in these areas: lower number of low [[birth weight]] babies, 50% decrease in child abuse or neglect, 25% increase in reading and math test grades in 1-3 grades, 60% increase in high school graduation rate. If trained visitors diligently follow the standards, the cost-benefit studies have demonstrated returns of investment from $1.75 to $5.70 on every dollar spent.&lt;ref name="ncsl_a" /&gt;{{rs|date=May 2014}}

== Cost==

===Federal funding===
Social Security Act, Title V, Section 511 (42 USC 711)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Visiting|url=https://mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-initiatives/home-visiting-overview|publisher=Maternal and Child Health Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; states to conduct a statewide assessment on needs of the at-risk population to be eligible for the grant award. It also requires states to achieve “quantifiable, measurable improvements” on the five areas of family life, listed above. HHS appropriates $100 million for fiscal year 2010, $250 million for FY 2011, $350 million for FY 2012, $400 million for FY 2014. 3% of available funding is reserved to fund Indian Tribes.&lt;ref name="ncsl_b" /&gt;

===Responsibility of States===
States also must file a report to the Secretary of HHS on the progress of the program, which must show improvements on at least four areas at the end of the first three-year period. HHS holds authority to terminate the grant to any states that fail to comply or demonstrate improvements. A final report must be submitted to HHS, no later than December 31, 2015.&lt;ref name="ncsl_b" /&gt;

'''Hostelling International Northern Ireland''' (HINI) is a not-for-profit organisation providing [[hostel|youth hostel]] accommodation in [[Northern Ireland]]. It is a member of the [[Hostelling International]] federation.

==Foundation==
The '''Youth Hostels Association of Northern Ireland''' was formed in 1931,&lt;ref name="history"&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.hini.org.uk/aboutus_history.cfm
|title=Hostelling International Northern Ireland - History
|accessdate=2009-03-27
|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812184456/http://www.hini.org.uk/aboutus_history.cfm
|archivedate=2007-08-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the same time as the '''[[Youth Hostels Association (England &amp; Wales)]]''' YHA(E&amp;W) and the '''[[Scottish Youth Hostels Association]]''' (SYHA).  All three arose from a slightly earlier proposal to form the '''Youth Hostel Association of Great Britain'''.

Like all associations, in its early days it offered spartan facilities for those on walking or cycling holidays to give them the opportunity to explore and experience the countryside in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Modern hostelling==
The name of the association changed to Hostelling International Northern Ireland in the 1990s. It runs three Hostels and one affiliated Hostel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hini.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; The hostels are in [[Belfast]], [[Bushmills]] and Whitepark Bay (near [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]]) and the newly refurbished affiliated hostel is situated in [[Armagh]].

All of the hostels provide a range of rooms, including private twins and doubles - and are suitable for individual backpackers, couples, families and groups.

'''Ingraham Glacier''' is on the south-eastern flank of [[Mount Rainier]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

Descending southeast, it approaches the east flank of [[Cowlitz Glacier]] and the two glaciers nearly join at {{convert|6700|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=topo&gt;{{Cite map|publisher=TopoQwest (United States Geological Survey Maps)|title=Mount Rainier East, WA|url=http://www.topoquest.com/map.php?lat=46.83973&amp;lon=-121.71190&amp;datum=nad83&amp;zoom=8&amp;map=auto&amp;coord=d&amp;mode=zoomout&amp;size=m|accessdate=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meltwater from the glacier drains into the [[Cowlitz River]].

==History==
About 35,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, the Ingraham and Cowlitz glaciers flowed {{convert|62|mi|abbr=on}}  down from Mount Rainier to near present-day [[Mossyrock, Washington]].&lt;ref name=change&gt;{{cite web|title=Cowlitz and Ingraham Glaciers|url=http://www.glaciers.pdx.edu/Projects/LearnAboutGlaciers/MRNP/Glc09.html|work=Glaciers and Glacier Change|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the Cowlitz - Ingraham glaciers advanced slightly from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, but have been in a general state of retreat since the end of the [[Little Ice Age]] around the year 1850. During the Little Ice Age, the Ingraham and Cowlitz glaciers were combined and terminated at the {{convert|5600|ft|adj=on}} level but have retreated more than {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} in the last 150&amp;nbsp;years.

The worst mountaineering accident in American history occurred in on June 21, 1981, when eleven people lost their lives in an ice fall on the Ingraham Glacier. None of the bodies were ever recovered.&lt;ref name=hatcher&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hatcher|first=Candy|title=Ghosts of Rainier: Icefall in 1981 entombed 11 climbers|newspaper=[[The Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=March 30, 2000|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ghostsofrainier/fall302.shtml|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="530">In [[psychology]], the '''lawn dart effect''' occurs when [[fighter aircraft]] [[Aviator|pilots]] accelerate horizontally at more than 1 [[standard gravity]].   The effect occurs when such extreme stimulation to the [[vestibular system]] leads to the perception that the aircraft is climbing, prompting the pilot to lower the aircraft's pitch attitude, or drop the nose.

'''MV Transportation, Inc.''', based in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]].,&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4280701 BusinessWeek, Company Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest privately-owned passenger transportation contracting services firm in the United States. The company provides paratransit, fixed-route, campus and corporate shuttles, and student transportation services, partnering with over 200 city and county government transit agencies, school districts, universities, and corporations.   MV serves over 110 million passengers each year across 30 states and Canada with a team of more than 20,000 transit professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvtransit.com/locations MV Transportation Locations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
MV Transportation, Inc., was founded in 1975 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], by Alex and Feysan Lodde, who continue to own the company.&lt;ref name="Fast Facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=MV Fast Facts|url=http://www.mvtransit.com/sites/default/files/MV%20Fast%20Facts%20Doc_updated%2005-29-14.pdf|website=MV Transportation|accessdate=13 November 2014|ref=FastFacts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Loddes realized the limited transportation options for the elderly and people with disabilities and began providing transportation services throughout the city.  By 1990, the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act was passed, mandating comparable transportation for passengers with disabilities. With 15 years of experience in this specialized mode of transport, MV stood ready to provide transportation solutions at scale on behalf of municipalities and transit agencies. 

Since that time MV has grown, now generating over $1.3B in annual revenues and representing more than 200 public transit agencies and private companies in performing their passenger transportation service in both the U.S. and Canada. It is the largest privately-owned transportation company in North America, providing paratransit, fixed route, shuttle and school transportation services.

The '''Mechelen-Zuid water tower''' is a 143 metre high, combined water and telecommunications tower constructed in 1978. Since 1979, it has supplied the water to the city of [[Mechelen]], Belgium, while also hosting television and telecommunications aerials. The concrete spire passes through a wide disc holding water fifty metres above the ground. Higher up, a smaller disc supports telecommunications equipment. Topped by a decorative stainless steel tube, it is claimed to be the highest [[water tower]] in the world.&lt;ref name="worldstallest"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://issuu.com/natuurpunt/docs/plantaardigenieuwsbrief201001/search?q=Stadsflora%20Mechelen-Zuid | title=Stadsflora Mechelen-Zuid | journal=Plantaardige Nieuwsbrief | issue=1 | language=Dutch | publisher=Natuurpunt vzw, Belgium | year=2010 | page=26 | accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning, design, and construction==
This water tower was built to supply an increased demand for water due to the growth of the Mechelen population, and of industry around the city. In March 1977, the City commissioned a design for a water tower with telecom purposes from local engineering firm ITH, who contacted Professor Fernand Mortelmans ([[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|University of Leuven]]),&lt;ref name="Cement-MZuidWT_1"&gt;Mortelmans, F. (1980), "Water- en antennetoren te Mechelen.", page 109, quote : "Om het probleem van de drinkwatervoorziening van de stad Mechelenopte lossen werd in 1963, in het industriepark Noord te Walem, een eerste watertoren gebouwd. In 1977 werdeen tweedetoren geprojecteerd in het industrieparkZuid; hiermeeis dewatervoor- ziening van de stad Mechelen opgelost ...  In de loop van maart 1977 werd door de stad Mechelen aan het Studiebureau ITH opdracht gegeven tot het ontwerp van een water- en antennetoren. De schrijver van dit artikel werd door het studiebureau verzocht als technisch raadgever op te treden, teneinde een ontwerp uit te werken, de algemene stabiliteitsberekeningen op te stellen en de uitvoering te begeleiden. De aanbesteding had plaats in september 1977.Detoren werd officieel ingehuldigd op 15 september 1979. De aannemer, fa. Van Hout uit Vosselaar, heeft de toren in een record tempo gebouwd."&lt;/ref&gt; who had been involved with the water tower at Mechelen's northern industrial estate.&lt;ref

The circular foundation is formed by 127 piles supporting a 19.6 m diameter concrete foundation slab up to 3 m thick at the centre which is 3.2m below ground level. It supports a tall conical hollow shaft of reinforced concrete which rises 120 m above ground level. The base is 9.2 m wide with a constant 0.65 m wall thickness to 44 m above ground at which point the shaft funnels outward to a thickness of 1.84 m over a 7.8m distance,above this is a 1m high and 10.64m wide ring beam which supports the water tank, a shallow bi-conical structure 40 m in diameter of 2,500m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; capacity. Above this container the towers's wall thickness is 0.50 m thick, diminishing to 0.20 m; it reaches the smallest diameter of 3.40m at 120 m.&lt;ref name="vsl_1" /&gt; The top of the tower is capped by a 20 m decorative stainless steel structure which narrows from 170&amp;nbsp;cm to 65&amp;nbsp;cm at the top,&lt;ref name="vsl_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="p113"&gt;Mortelmans, F. (1980), "Water- en antennetoren te Mechelen.", page 113, "4. De roestvrij stalen mast", quote: "De roestvrij stalen mast - De mast bestaat uit een mantel van roestvrij staal ... Dedoorsnede aan de top is 65 cm, aan de basis 170cm ...  Bovenop dit uitschuifbaar mastje is een bliksemafleider en een rood lichtbaken geplaatst"&lt;/ref&gt; which supports a [[Aircraft warning lights|red warning beacon]], a 3m pole of 15&amp;nbsp;cm diameter, and a [[lightning rod]].&lt;ref name="vsl_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="p113"/&gt;

The main body of the supporting shaft was built up by [[slip forming]]. Around it, the water tank was constructed in prestressed concrete at ground level: Stiffness is provided by 0.35 m thick walls, which subdivide it into sixteen [[Circular sector|sectors]]. The 0.30 m thick tank bottom is angled at 17° to the horizontal, the top surface is shallower. The container was raised into its final position by cables: once in position the lifting cables were used to support the tank body from the ring beam on the shaft, being tensioned within concrete columns. Finally the base of the tank was concreted to the tower shaft.&lt;ref

==Other equipment==

A 10 m diameter platform at about 100 m supports the radio transmission equipment, other telecommunications equipment ([[Parabolic antenna]]s) were positioned above the water tank.&lt;ref name="vsl_1"/&gt;

'''The Mental Health Systems Act of 1980''' (MHSA) was [[United States]] legislation signed by President [[Jimmy Carter]] which provided grants to community mental health centers. During the following [[Ronald Reagan]] administration, the [[United States Congress]] repealed most of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Matt|title=Cook County Jail, America's Largest Mental Hospital is a Jail|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/americas-largest-mental-hospital-is-a-jail/395012/|accessdate=2015-09-13|work=The Atlantic|date=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MHSA was considered landmark legislation in mental health care policy.

==History==
Coinciding with a movement during the 1970s for rehabilitation of people with severe mental illnesses, the Mental Health Systems Act supported and financed community mental health support systems, which coordinated general health care, mental health care, and social support services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldman|first1=H.

While some concerns existed about the methodology followed by the President's Committee, the report served as the foundation for the MHSA, which in turn was seen as landmark legislation in U.S. mental health policy.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Alexander|title=Ronald Reagan and the Commitment of the Mentally Ill: Capital, Interest Groups, and the Eclipse of Social Policy|journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology|date=1998|volume=3|issue=4|url=http://sociology.org/content/vol003.004/thomas_d.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, signed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] on August 13, 1981, repealed most of the MHSA. The [[U.S. patients' bill of rights|Patients' Bill of Rights]], section 501, was not repealed; per Congressional record, the Congress felt that state provisions were sufficient and section 501 served as a recommendation to states to review and refine existing policies.&lt;ref name=lyon-levine&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon-Levine|first1=Martha|last2=Levine|first2=Martin|last3=Zusman|first3=Jack|title=Developments in Patients' Bill of Rights Since the Mental Health Systems Act|journal=Mental and Physical Disability Law Reporter|date=March 1985|volume=9|issue=2|url=http://law.usc.edu/assets/docs/Developments_in_Patients.pdf|accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minister of Health and Solidarity''' is a [[French government ministers|cabinet]] position in the [[Cabinet of France|Government of France]]. The health portfolio oversees the health care public services and the health insurance part of the French Social Security. As French ministerial departments are not fixed and depend on the Prime Minister's choice, the Minister sometimes also has one or some of other portfolios among Work, Pensions, Family, the Elderly, Handicapped people and Women's Rights. In that case, he is helped by one or some junior Minister focusing on one part of the portfolio. The current Minister is [[Agnès Buzyn]].

[[File:Richard Everitt from family photo album.jpg|thumb|Richard Everitt]]
On 13 August 1994, 15-year-old '''Richard Everitt''' was stabbed to death in [[London]] in a racially motivated attack. Everitt's neighbourhood, [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]], had been the site of ethnic tensions, and although he was not involved in gangs, he was murdered by a gang of [[British Bangladeshi]]s who were seeking revenge on another [[White British]] boy. 

The murderer was not apprehended, as members of the gang fled to Bangladesh. Badrul Miah and Showat Akbar were tried in 1995 as the ringleaders of the gang and were given life sentences, with minimum terms of 12 years and three years in custody respectively.

==Background==
Somers Town, in the [[London Borough of Camden]], was experiencing [[urban decay]] in the early 1990s. Many of its white families had been moved onto newer estates, and the ones who remained lived in poverty and unemployment, and felt in conflict with Bengalis. Bengalis were living in the neighbourhood's worst housing, with problems of overcrowding due to their larger-than-average families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malik|first1=Kenan|title=Somers Town: where lessons go unlearnt|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/somers-town-where-lessons-go-unlearnt-1384872.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=21 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White youths and Bengali youths respectively chose to attend different schools and youth clubs, and interracial relationships were shunned.&lt;ref name=indy1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Braid|first1=Mary|title=Fear and loathing after 'racial' murder: Gangs of teenagers have vowed to avenge the death of a white schoolboy stabbed by a group of Asians in Somers Town, north London, on Saturday.

Richard Everitt attended [[South Camden Community School (SCCS)|South Camden Community School]], where the ethnic tensions continued, although he was not involved in them. His mother had previously complained when he was allegedly threatened with a knife by an Asian pupil.&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt;

==Murder==
On the night of 13 August 1994, Everitt returned from playing football to ask for permission to go to [[Burger King]] with his friends. They encountered a gang of fifteen Bengali youths aged 18–19 and began to run, but Everitt was caught and stabbed with a seven-inch kitchen knife in his shoulder blades, piercing his heart. His friends notified his parents, who came to him as he was loaded into the ambulance. Everitt died at the hospital.&lt;ref name=mirror&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCaffrey|first1=Julie|title=Exclusive: I can't forgive my son's knife crime killer|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/family/exclusive-i-cant-forgive-my-sons-knife-347352|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
Eleven men were arrested and [[bail]]ed shortly after Everitt was stabbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Ian|title=Race motive suspected in murder of white boy: Friends find teenager stabbed in street|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/race-motive-suspected-in-murder-of-white-boy-friends-find-teenager-stabbed-in-street-1383575.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=23 October 2011 |origyear= 14 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial began on 5 October 1995 at the [[Old Bailey]]. On 1 November, Badrul Miah was found guilty of conspiring to murder Everitt and was given a 'life' sentence with a minimum of 12 years in prison; Showat Akbar was found guilty of violent disorder and sentenced to three years' youth detention. Their gang had been seeking revenge on a white teenager suspected of stealing their jewellery, and Miah boasted that he had "stabbed up a white boy". Miah and Akbar were deemed by the judge to have been the ringleaders of the attack, but she stated that the identity of the killer was unknown as some of the gang members had fled to Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McKie|first1=John|title=Gang leader gets life for killing boy|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/gang-leader-gets-life-for-killing-boy-1536715.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|date=1 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Miah was given four days' unsupervised release to attend his sister's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Race killer freed for party|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/44051/Race-killer-freed-for-party.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Everitt's murder was received with shock in Somers Town. A Bengali teenager told ''[[The Independent]]'' "The boy seems to have had nothing to do with trouble. We are so shocked that Bengali boys could do this. It is the innocent increasingly who are suffering".&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt; The Deputy Headmaster of Everitt's school told the press that cohesion was generally good at the school.&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt; Jalal Uddin, a Bengali activist, spoke of his fears that revenge attacks could continue perpetually.&lt;ref name=news/

A [[Halal]] butcher's was firebombed, and white gangs attacked Bengalis.&lt;ref name=indy2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malik|first1=Kenan|title=Somers Town: where lessons go unlearnt|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/somers-town-where-lessons-go-unlearnt-1384872.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bengalis told family members to stay indoors, and the police increased their presence in order to combat the gangs.&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt; A white gang member said that he would not accept support from the [[British National Party]] because "the BNP comes down here, gets everyone whipped up and then when the trouble starts we get it and they run away".&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt;

After the convictions, Everitt's family were abused by Bengali neighbours, and moved to [[Essex]] before settling in [[Haworth]], [[West Yorkshire]]. His mother successfully campaigned for stronger sentences for [[knife legislation|knife crime]].&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt;

The murder was mentioned by ''[[India Today]]'' as attributable to a decline in values among [[British Asian]] youth, who were previously considered a [[model minority]] but were becoming increasingly involved with drugs and gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merchant|first1=Khozem|title=Immigrant gangland|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/asian-youths-turn-to-drugs-gangs-and-crime-in-london/1/294235.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=[[India Today]]|date=15 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In response to Everitt's murder, the KXL Camden United project was founded using football to bring young people together. The football team is for players aged 15 to 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/special_events/sport_relief/2122579.stm|title=BBC SPORT - Sport Relief - Community team scores a winner|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] activist Alan Walter launched Camden Action Now alongside Everitt's parents, offering youth activities and aiming to unite the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/mar/16/alan-walter-obituary|title=Alan Walter|first=Austin|last=Mitchell|date=16 March 2009|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''N.A. Semashko City Hospital No. 1''' is a large [[hospital]] in [[Rostov-on-Don]].

== History ==
Central Hospital № 1 of the city of Rostov-on-Don begins its history in June 1922, when the Don district hospital was opened in the city. The new hospital was opened on the place of the infectious [[barracks]] of the military evacuation hospital, where they fought epidemics of [[cholera]], [[typhus]], [[dysentery]] and other diseases of this type. The chief doctor of the new hospital was Dr. E.B Libenzon. In September of the same year, the Nikolaev City Hospital and the medical faculty of the [[University of Warsaw]] moved to the hospital. Until the end of the year, another surgical department under the leadership of Leon Solomonovich Astvatsaturov started operating. Children department of Nikolaev hospital took one of the repaired barracks and calculated 30-40 beds. In the same building a nursery for the hospital staff was organised. The therapeutical department under the leadership of Perfiliev was designed for 70 beds.

The hospital equipment was the basis of the new hospital's three-room laboratory; The head of the laboratory was Dr. M.I. Shyschal, the first dissector was D.V. Khovansky, who was soon replaced by Professor I.I. Krinitsky, who really developed the hospital's pro-sectoral service. Krinitsky became the organizer of the clinical-anatomical conferences and, as pointed out by local historian Minas Bagdykov, founded a new [[Pathoanatomy|pathoanatomical]] school.

In 1923, an infectious disease department was established in the hospital. It was designed to solve the problems of fighting typhus, cholera and [[malaria]]. The future academician B.I Trusevich became its first head. In the next two years, two more infectious departments were created, later the total number of beds in all three departments reached 300. The children's infectious disease department was designed for 120 patients with [[scarlet fever]]. It was headed by Dr. M.E Lansberg. Later the ward for the sick with [[measles]] (1925) appeared, it was followed by chicken pox and diphtheria in 1926.

In 1926, according to the project of Moscow architects Golosov, Grinberg and Ilyin,&lt;ref name="NV" /&gt; the construction of a model hospital began and completed in 1930. The new hospital had 2,100 beds, its chief doctor was Dr. S. Klyachkin. The therapeutic department of the new hospital occupied a separate two-story building with 220 beds (since 1933 it was based on the Department of Hospital Therapy of Rostov University, until 1954, headed by Professor AS Voronov, then Professor NM Ivanov).

Since 1931, the hospital had a separate children's hospital with 120 places, headed by Dr. E.M Grinberg. Later the children's departments of the hospital were used by the Department of Children's Diseases of Rostov University under the direction of Professor I. Y. Serebriisky. In 1931 an otolaryngological department was opened. The medical institute immediately began operating  on its base. D.I. Zimont was the director until 1953, later he was replaced by the head of the department of ENT Khanamirov, who created his own school).

After the restoration of the right wing of the hospital, which suffered greatly during [[the Great Patriotic War]], the eye clinic moved into it. In the hospital complex also includes the Oncology Center.

== Object of cultural heritage ==
Complex Hospital № 1, named Semashko is one of two architectural monuments of the Soviet [[avant-garde]] in Rostov-on-Don. It is the second object of this style after Rostov Drama Theater. The facades of the hospital are made of facing sand-lime bricks, the architecture is functional: according to the shape of the windows you can understand which rooms are behind them.&lt;ref name="NV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvgazeta.ru/news/12381/473056/|title=Не "холерные бараки", но памятник авангарда|author=Елена Слепцова.|date=17 May 2012|work=Наше время|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the hospital administration decided to construct a new 12-storey building and to demolish the old buildings. An inquiry was instituted. A compromise solution allowed to combine the construction of a new building with preservation of architectural monuments. But in 2012 the conflict flared up again. The hospital management addressed directly to the governor [[Vasily Golubev (politician)|Vasiliy Golubev]]. The Regional Office initiated an expert examination in Stavropol and asked for the support of A.P Kudryavtsev, the Chairman of the Academic Council for the Protection of the Heritage of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Building Sciences.&lt;ref name="NV" /&gt;

At the beginning 2013, the administration of the Rostov region recognized the complex of hospital buildings as an object of cultural heritage of international significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.cntd.ru/document/469800083|title=Об утверждении предмета охраны объекта культурного наследия регионального значения "Комплекс зданий Городской больницы N 1 им.

'''Orchitis''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɔr|ˈ|k|aɪ|t|ɪ|s}} or '''orchiditis''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɔr|k|ɪ|ˈ|d|aɪ|t|ɪ|s}} (from the Ancient Greek [[wikt:ὄρχις#Ancient Greek|ὄρχις]] meaning "testicle"; same root as ''[[orchid]]'') is [[inflammation]] of the [[testes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|six/000075643|orchitis}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also involve swelling, heavy pains and frequent infection, particularly of the epididymis, and is more rarely known as '''didymitis''' (as in ''[[epididymis]]'').

==Symptoms==
[[Symptom]]s of orchitis are similar to those of [[testicular torsion]]. These can include:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* [[hematospermia]] (blood in the [[semen]])
* [[hematuria]] (blood in the [[urine]])
* severe [[pain]]
* visible [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of a testicle or testicles and often the inguinal lymph nodes on the affected side.

==Causes==
Orchitis can be related to [[epididymitis]] infection that has spread to the [[testicles]] (then called "epididymo-orchitis"), sometimes caused by the [[sexually transmitted disease]]s [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhea]].  It has also been reported in cases of males infected with [[brucellosis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Brucellosis in Humans and Animals'' World Health Organization Publication number WHO/CDS/EPR/2006.7 [http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/Brucellosis.pdf]{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orchitis can also be seen during active [[mumps]], particularly in adolescent boys.

[[Ischemic]] orchitis may result from damage to the blood vessels of the [[spermatic cord]] during [[Hernia repair|inguinal herniorrhaphy]], and may in the worst event lead to [[testicular atrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Simons MP, Aufenacker T, Bay-Nielsen M, etal |title=European Hernia Society guidelines on the treatment of inguinal hernia in adult patients |journal=Hernia |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=343–403 |date=August 2009  |pmid=19636493 |pmc=2719730 |doi=10.1007/s10029-009-0529-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Ultrasonography of orchitis.jpg|thumb|[[Doppler ultrasound]] of the scrotum, in the [[axial plane]], showing orchitis (as part of [[epididymo-orchitis]]) as [[hypoechogenic]] and slightly heterogenic left testicular tissue (right in image), with an increased blood flow. There is also swelling of peritesticular tissue.]]
* Blood – ESR high
* Urine – Cultural &amp; Sensitivity test
* Ultrasound scanning

==Treatment==
In most cases where orchitis is caused by epididymitis, treatment is an oral antibiotic such as [[cefalexin]] or [[ciprofloxacin]] until infection clears up. In both causes [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] such as [[naproxen]] or [[ibuprofen]] are recommended to relieve pain. Sometimes stronger pain medications in the [[opiate]] category are called for and are frequently prescribed by experienced [[emergency department]] physicians.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Orchitis is not rare in [[bull]]s and [[sheep|rams]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

'''Ottoi Călin''' (March 1886 - April 1, 1917) was a [[Romania]]n physician, journalist and [[Socialism|socialist]] militant, considered one of the [[Theoretician (Marxism)|theoreticians]] of the [[Labour movement in Romania|Romanian workers' movement]] during the early 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Călin was born in a poor [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] family in [[Iaşi]], in north-eastern Romania. After finishing high school, he obtained a medical degree from the [[Grigore T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy|local university]]. During his teen years, along with other young students, he frequented the ''Circle of Social Studies'' organized by socialists [[Leon Ghelerter]] and [[Max Vexler]]. The ''Circle'', the main left-wing association in [[Moldavia]] at the time, played a major role in shaping future leaders of the Romanian socialist movement, such as [[Mihail Gheorghiu Bujor]] and [[Ilie Moscovici]].{{sfn|Petrescu|n.d.|p=162}}{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=177}} Beside participating in the ''Circle'', Călin lectured on [[Natural sciences|natural]] and [[social science]]s for a local [[Adult education|adult school]]. Beginning with 1908, he published regularly in the ''[[Viitorul Social]]'' magazine, with his articles targeting primarily theoretical and tactical issues. Among his noted contributions of the time are a brief biography on [[Karl Marx]], providing an analysis of the latter's contributions to the development of [[scientific socialism]], and a history of the [[Paris Commune]], presented as a proof of the viability of [[Communist society|proletarian rule]]. During the same period, Călin also worked towards the establishment of a socialist youth organization. In 1910 he was one of the representatives of the Iaşi socialists at the Congress that formalised the creation of the [[Social Democratic Party of Romania (1910-1918)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD).{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=178}}

After graduating in 1911, with the support of fellow party-members, Călin left for Western Europe in order to further his medical studies. Following a brief stay in [[Berlin]], he arrived in [[Paris]], where he joined the existing Romanian socialist group comprising, among others, [[Christian Rakovsky]], [[Ioan Sion (politician)|Ioan Sion]] and [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]]. Călin used the occasion to forge relations with the [[French Section of the Workers' International|local socialist party]]. Continuing his theoretical pursuits, he was particularly influenced by the ideas [[Jean Jaurès]], embracing [[pacifism]].{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=180}}

==Activism and war==
Returning to Romania, Călin settled in [[Bucharest]] and practised medicine, specializing as an [[Internal medicine|internist]]. At the same time he continued his journalistic activity, writing for ''Viitorul Social'' and ''[[România Muncitoare]]'', and lectured on the [[History of socialism|history of socialist doctrines]] for the ''Socialist School'' set up by the party in Romania's capital.{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=180}} Along with many of the leading party members, Călin was one of the founding members of ''Casa Poporului'', a [[cooperative|cooperative society]] established in October 1914 in order to manage the various party headquarters across Romania.{{sfn|Petrescu|n.d.|p=231}} As a recognition for his efforts, in 1913, the Executive Committee of the PSD designated him as the [[editor in chief]] of the second series of ''Viitorul Social'', position he would hold until 1915.{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=179}} The main responsible with the magazine's columns on the international socialist movement, he also continued to contribute articles on major theoretical themes, such as [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarism]], the [[universal vote]], and the [[Opposition to World War I|socialist attitude towards the war]] . Around this time, he also held, under the pseudonym ''Ioan Otescu'', the weekly medical column in ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'', and published research articles in ''Higiena'', concentrating on [[Social determinants of health in poverty|illnesses prevalent among the poor]].{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=180}} Furthermore, Călin translated [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]]'s [[The Mother (1906 novel)|The Mother]] and, along with Bujor, [[Karl Kautsky]]'s commentary on the [[Erfurt Program]].{{sfn|Petrescu|n.d.|p=93}}

[[File:Romanian socialists, 1915.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Călin (middle row, sixth from left) and other leaders of the Romanian Social Democratic Party at the 60th anniversary of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] (1915)]]
A delegate to the 1914 PSD Congress, Călin advocated a more militant party position on the [[Land reform in Romania|agrarian issue]], and was decisive in the adoption of [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] as the party's stance towards [[World War I]]. In October 1915, at the Extraordinary PSD Congress, he prepared the main report, which commented on the attitude of the European socialist movement towards the war. The report, critical of the Bureau of the [[Second International]], adopted the [[antimilitarism|anti-militarist]] stance of the first [[Zimmerwald Conference]],{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|pp=180-181}} while at the same time providing that, were Romania to join the war, the socialists would take no action that would damage the government.{{sfn|Liveanu|1960|pp=114-115}} The report was approved by a large majority. At the same Congress, Călin was also elected to the party's Executive Committee, along with [[Ecaterina Arbore]], [[Alecu Constantinescu]], [[Gheorghe Cristescu]], [[I.C. Frimu]], [[Dimitrie Marinescu]], and [[Christian Rakovsky]]. During the following months, he took part in the organisation of various anti-war protests across the country.{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=181}}

In the second part of 1916, as [[Romania in World War I|Romania joined the war]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], Călin was drafted as a [[combat medic]], and was later assigned to the [[military ambulance]]. Retreating to Moldavia along with the whole Romanian Army, he contracted [[Epidemic typhus|typhus]] during the epidemic that ravaged the region during the war. Transported to Iaşi for treatment, he died there in early April 1917.{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=182}} Over one thousand workers and socialists were present on {{OldStyleDate|April 16||April 3}} at his burial, which became the first major socialist public gathering in Romania after the start of the war. The manifestation, and especially the anti-war eulogy given by Bujor, which called on the Romanian workers to follow the example of the [[February Revolution|anti-monarchic revolution]] in [[Russia]], resulted in a major crack-down by the authorities on the renascent socialist movement in Moldavia.{{sfn|Liveanu|1956|p=21}}

[[File:Paris-Egouts-p1010721.jpg|thumb|Sewers under the city in 2005.]]
The '''sewers''' of the [[France|French]] capital [[Paris]] date back to the year 1370 when the first underground system was constructed under [[Rue Montmartre]]. Consecutive French governments enlarged the system to cover the city's population, including expansions under [[Louis XIV]] and [[Napoleon III]], and modernisation programs in the 1990s under Mayor [[Jacques Chirac]]. The system has featured in popular culture through its existence, including  [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 novel, ''[[Les Misérables]]'', and [[Harold L. Humes|H. L. Humes]]' 1958 novel ''The Underground City''.

==History==
Until the [[Middle Ages]], the drinking water in [[Paris]] was taken from the [[River Seine]]. The wastewater was poured onto fields or unpaved streets, and finally filtered back into the Seine. Around 1200, [[Philip II of France|Phillipe Auguste]] had the Parisian streets paved, incorporating a drain for wastewater in their middle. In 1370 [[Hugues Aubriot]], a Parisian provost had a vaulted, stone-walled sewer built in the "rue Montmartre". This sewer collected the wastewater and took it to the "[[Menilmontant brook]]". However, the wastewater was still drained in the open air.&lt;ref name="mtholyoke.edu"&gt;{{cite web | ref=harv | year=2010 | url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist255-s01/mapping-paris/Paris_Sewers_Page.html | title=The Sewers of Paris: A Brief History | website=mtholyoke.edu | accessdate = February 23, 2010 | last=| first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the reign of [[Louis XIV]], a large ring sewer was built on the right bank, and the [[Bièvre River]] was used as a sewer for the left bank of the Seine.{{fact|date=September 2017}} On at least two occasions in the late 1700s, Paris refused to build an updated water system that scientists had studied.  Women were actually carrying water from the river Seine to their residences in buckets.  Voltaire wrote about it, saying that they "will not begrudge money for a Comic Opera, but will complain about building aqueducts worthy of Augustus".  [[Louis Pasteur]] himself lost three children to typhoid.  Under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], the first Parisian vaulted sewer network was built. It was 30&amp;nbsp;km long.  

In 1855, as a part of his plan to improve the sanitation and traffic circulation in Paris,  [[Napoleon III]] ordered the construction of new boulevards, aqueducts and sewers.{{fact|date=September 2017}} His prefect for the Seine, [[Baron Haussmann]], and the engineer [[Eugène Belgrand]], designed the present Parisian sewer and water supply networks. Thus was built, more than a century ago, a double water supply network (one for drinking water and one for non drinking water) and a sewer network that was 600&amp;nbsp;km long in 1878.&lt;ref name=".paris.fr.2"&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv |year=2010 |url=http://www.paris.fr/portail/Environnement/Portal.lut?page_id=1313&amp;document_type_id=5&amp;document_id=2158&amp;portlet_id=3139 |title=Les égouts parisiens |format= |publisher=paris.fr |accessdate=February 23, 2010 |last= |first= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003225317/http://www.paris.fr/portail/Environnement/Portal.lut?page_id=1313&amp;document_type_id=5&amp;document_id=2158&amp;portlet_id=3139 |archivedate=October 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1880 to 1913, efforts were taken to connect Parisian buildings to the sewers (they were most at the time "connected to the city's clean water network and the rest had access to free neighborhood taps (''fontaines'')").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kesztenbaum|first=Lionel|last2=Rosenthal|first2=Jean-Laurent|date=2017-03-01|title=Sewers' diffusion and the decline of mortality: The case of Paris, 1880–1914|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119016000139|journal=Journal of Urban Economics|series=Urbanization in Developing Countries\: Past and Present|volume=98|pages=174–186|doi=10.1016/j.jue.2016.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1914, 68% of all buildings in Paris had direct connections to the sewer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research shows that this contributed to a decline in mortality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===From Belgrand to the present===
[[File:Boule musee egout Paris1.jpg|thumb|Ball used to clean sewer tunnels by pushing the water in front of the ball.&lt;ref name="yosomono"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|year= 2010 |url = http://gaijinass.wordpress.com/2010/02/20/worlds-biggest-balls/|title = World's biggest balls|format = |publisher = gaijinass.wordpress.com| accessdate = February 23, 2010 |author=yosomono |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Belgrand's successors went on extending the Parisian network: from 1914 to 1977, more than 1000&amp;nbsp;km of new sewers were built.

At the end of [[World War I]], the 50&amp;nbsp;km² of sewage fields were no longer sufficient to protect the Seine. A general sewage treatment programme, designed to meet the needs for 50 years, was drawn up and became state-approved in 1935: this was the beginning of industrial sewage treatment.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

The aim was to carry all the Parisian wastewater to the Achères treatment plant using a network of effluent channels. Since then, the Achères plant has continued to grow. At the end of 1970, it was one of the biggest sewage treatment plants in [[Europe]]. Its actual capacity is more than 2 million cubic metres per day.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

This programme has been gradually upgraded: modernization of the Achères and Noisy-le-Grand (a small station farther upstream) facilities, construction of a new plant at Valenton, and expansion of the Colombes experimental station.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

==Modernization now and in the future==
The aims of the modernization programme launched by the Mayor of Paris in 1991 were: to protect the Seine from storm overflow pollution by reducing the amount of untreated water discharged directly into the Seine, to reinforce the existing sewers, to enable the network to function better.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

This project, which is costing an estimated 152 million euros over the first 5 years, will include:{{fact|date=September 2017}}

* the refurbishing of the old sewers in bad condition,
* the renovation of pumping stations,
* the construction of new sewers,
* the installation of measuring devices and automated flow control management,
* the improving of the management of solid waste and grit,
* the development of the computerised network management system.

==The sewer in fictional stories==
[[File:Paris egouts.jpg|thumb|Mannequin in the Museum]]
The sewer system is described in [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 novel, ''[[Les Misérables]]'' (Part 5, ''Jean Valjean''; Book II, ''The Intestine of the Leviathan'', ch.1, ''The Land Impoverished by the Sea''): "...Paris has another Paris under herself; a Paris of sewers; which has its streets, its crossings, its squares, its blind alleys, its arteries, and its circulation, which is slime, minus the human form."&lt;ref name="mtholyoke.edu"/&gt;

The sewer system plays a key part in [[Harold L. Humes|H. L. Humes]]' 1958 novel, ''[[The Underground City]]''. Humes, an American novelist, was a cofounder of the ''[[Paris Review]]''.

The sewer features in a section of Max Brook's ''[[World War Z]]''. Many people fled to the sewers to escape the dead, but were followed, leaving one of the most dangerous campaigns of the "war".

In the American television show ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' episode "The Man from Space", broadcast 31 December 1955, sewer worker Ed Norton comes in dressed as an 18th-century [[fop]], and announces that he will win the Raccoon lodge costume ball because he is dressed as "Pierre Francois Brioschi, designer of the Paris sewers."{{fact|date=September 2017}}

==Museum==
{{Main|Paris Sewer Museum}}
The Paris Sewer Museum ({{lang-fr|Musée des Égouts de Paris}}), is dedicated to the [[sanitary sewer|sewer system]] of [[Paris]]. Tours of the sewage system have been popular since the 1800s and are currently conducted at the sewers. Visitors are able to walk upon raised walkways directly above the sewage itself. The entrance is near the [[Pont de l'Alma]].

'''Paternity fraud''', also known as '''misattributed paternity'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2598159 | pmid=17664309 | doi=10.1136/jme.2005.013268 | volume=33 | title=Paternity fraud and compensation for misattributed paternity | date=August 2007 | journal=J Med Ethics | pages=475–80| last1 = Draper | first1 = H}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''paternal discrepancy''',&lt;ref name = "tel1"/&gt; is when a man is incorrectly identified to be the biological [[father]] of a child. The underlying assumption of paternity fraud is that the mother deliberately misidentified the biological father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=B|first=Jacobs, Melanie|date=2004|title=When Daddy Doesn't Want to Be Daddy Anymore: An Argument Against Paternity Fraud Claims|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjlf/vol16/iss2/3/|journal=Yale Journal of Law &amp; Feminism|language=en|volume=16|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paternity fraud is related to the historical understanding of [[adultery]].

==Occurrence==
Research published in 2016 indicated that one in 50 British fathers is unknowingly raising a child who is the biological child of another man, and that misattributed paternity is rarer than commonly believed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/fatherhood/one-in-50-british-fathers-unknowingly-raise-another-mans-child/ One in 50 British fathers unknowingly raises another man's child] Published by The Telegraph, April 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 scientific review of international published studies of paternal discrepancy found a range in incidence, around the world, from 0.8% to 30% (median 3.7%).&lt;ref name="pmid16100312"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellis MA, Hughes K, Hughes S, Ashton JR |title=Measuring paternal discrepancy and its public health consequences |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=749–54 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16100312 |pmc=1733152 |doi=10.1136/jech.2005.036517 |url=http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16100312}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as many of the studies were conducted between the 1950s and the 1980s, numbers may be unreliable due to the inaccuracies of genetic testing methods and procedures used at the time. Studies ranging in date from 1991 to 1999, quote the following incidence rates: 4.0% (Canada), 2.8% (France), 1.4% and 1.6% (UK), and 11.8% (Mexico), 0.8% (Switzerland).&lt;ref name="pmid16100312"/&gt; These numbers suggest that the widely quoted and unsubstantiated figure of 10% of non-paternal events is an overestimate. However, in studies that solely looked at couples who obtained paternity testing because paternity was being disputed, there are higher levels; an incidence of 17% to 33% (median of 26.9%). Most at risk were those born to younger parents, to unmarried couples and those of lower socio-economic status, or from certain cultural groups.&lt;ref name="Wintour"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/01/freedomofinformation.childprotection | location=United Kingdom | work=The Guardian | first=Patrick | last=Wintour | title=One in 500 fathers wrongly identified by mothers in Child Support Agency claims | date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study in the [[United Kingdom]] found that biological fathers were misidentified in 0.2% (1 in 500) of the cases processed by the Child Support Agency. Of that 0.2%, those resolved with [[DNA paternity testing]] between 2004 and 2008 showed that between 10 and 19% of mothers had misidentified the biological father; data about why mothers identified the wrong biological father was not available.&lt;ref name="Wintour"/&gt;

===Australia===

The Victorian County Court in 2002 awarded Mr. Magill $70,000 compensation for damages and economic loss against his ex-wife as a result of DNA testing in 2000 that showed only one of three children he was paying support for were genetically his.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/11/09/1162661797800.html | work=The Age | location=Australia | title=Paternity fraud 'dad' loses appeal | date=9 November 2006 | first=News | last=Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;
That ruling was later overturned in 2005 by the Victorian Court of Appeal finding that "intent to deceive" by the ex-wife had not been proven regarding misrepresentations made by Ms. Magill in birth forms about the children's paternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Appeal-blow-for-man-who-paid-maintenance-for-anothers-children/2005/03/17/1110913737586.html | work=The Age | location=Australia | title=Appeal blow for man who paid maintenance for another's children | date=18 March 2005 | first=Peter | last=Gregory }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This ruling was in turn then appealed with the High Court of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Dad-loses-child-support-case/2006/10/31/1162056981681.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | location=Australia | title=Dad loses child support case | date=31 October 2006 |agency=Australian Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Australia's High Court struck down the appeal, upholding the 2005 Victorian Court of Appeal ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2006/51.html | work=Aust LII | location=AUS | title=Magill v Magill | date=9 November 2006 | first=High Court of | last=Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chief Justice Murray Gleeson in the 94 page High Court Ruling opined, "Without doubt the appellant's wife deceived him but the hurtful deception was in her infidelity, not in her failure to admit it."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/where-are-honesty-and-justice/story-e6frezz0-1111112502345 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=Australia | title=Where are honesty and justice? | date=11 November 2006 | first=Larissa | last=Cummings }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. Magill as part of the ruling was also ordered to pay the Child Support Agency's legal fees during the previous 18 months of litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200611/s1784552.htm | work=ABC News | location=Australia | title=High Court rejects father's deceit claim | date=11 November 2006 | first=Australian | last=Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 High Court Ruling led to many calls from within Australia for reforms and changes to the Family Law Act and the Child Support Act to help protect men in Mr Magill's situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/dna-test-rights-proposed-for-duped-dads/story-e6frfkp9-1111112528746 | work=The Australian  | location=Australia | title=DNA test rights proposed for duped dads | date=16 November 2006 | first=Australian | last=News }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 2008 putative fathers in Australia could begin using DNA testing to confirm paternity regarding support orders after new changes, "section 143 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act", took effect regarding Family Court policies. The Magill case is often cited regarding new law reforms in Australia and is considered a landmark type case.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/parents-war-on-dna/story-e6freuy9-1111117999005 | work=The Telegraph | location=Australia | title=Paternity tests prove hundreds of men duped | date=11 November 2008 | first=Kelvin | last=Bissett }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Mr. Cornelio began paying child support for his ex-wife's twins after the couple separated in 1998. The former couple settled upon a joint custody agreement in 2002 that continued Mr. Cornelio's monetary child support for the twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/man-who-didnt-father-twins-must-pay-child-support/article1146243/ | work=The Globe and Mail | location=Canada | title=Man who didn't father twins must pay child support | date=9 April 2009 | first=Kirk | last=Makin }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly afterwards Ms. Cornelio requested a reduction in visitation time along with an increase in support payments. Mr. Cornelio became suspicious of the paternity of the twins. A subsequent DNA test revealed that he was not their biological father. A request was made by Mr. Cornelio to be excused from paying further child support, claiming to be the victim of misrepresentation or fraud when Ms. Cornelio failed to disclose the extramarital affair when he signed the 2002 joint custody agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/563571--man-must-pay-support-though-twins-not-his | work=The Toronto Star | location=Canada | title=Man must pay support though twins not his | date=8 January 2009 | first=Precious | last=Yutangco }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2008 ruled against the request to be excused or reimbursed for child support payments. Judge van Rensburg, in deciding to deny the request, noted that Mr. Cornelio had wondered at the time of his separation if an affair by his ex-wife had actually been responsible for the twins. "It was not until access was interrupted and Ms. Cornelio commenced proceedings seeking increased child support that the respondent began pursuing this issue," the judge remarked. "The fact of that relationship – even if it has now become strained – is sufficient to require Mr. Cornelio to continue to contribute toward the children's material needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2008/2008canlii68884/2008canlii68884.html | work= | location=Ontario, Canada | title=Cornelio v. Cornelio, 2008 CanLII 68884 (ON SC) | date=22 December 2008 | first=Superior Court of Justice | last=Ontario }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===

The default in Finnish law as of 2018 is that the husband is the acknowledged father of the child who is born into wedlock (or to a deceased husband). Only if the wife agrees, can that initial determination be set to something else. However, from 2016 the general right the mother to solely allow or prevent the parental investigation was abolished. The default and immediately forcing juridical assumption of paternity of a husband was not changed in the latest 2015 act.

A man can bring up a later legal action to annul his paternity, disregarding of the resistance of his wife. The legal action for annulment may be brought in the district court by a man whose paternity has been determined on the basis of either marriage or by some other authoratitive decision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lansivayla.fi/artikkeli/319235-isyyslaki-mullistuu-tunnukseen-helpotus-sylkinaytekoe-ja-peruutusmahdollisuus Isyyslaki mullistuu: Tunnukseen helpotus, sylkinäytekoe ja peruutusmahdollisuus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 41&lt;/ref&gt;

A man who has officially acknowledged paternity relinquishes his rights to further actions if he, knowing the woman had a sexual intercourse with another man, or that she has used foreign sperm for fertilization, has stated in writing following birth of the child that the child is biologically his.&lt;ref&gt;Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise legally binding prebirth acknowledgment of a man must be rejected, if either the health care staff of the child supervisor do have a founded suspicion that the man is not a father of the child, or he is for any reason not capable to understand what he is doing when acknowledging the paternity.&lt;ref&gt;Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 16&lt;/ref&gt;

If a mother deliberately gives false information to the authorities, which contributes to the erroneous establishment of paternity, she may be fined.&lt;ref&gt;Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===

In 2004, a [[South Korea]]n man was awarded $42,380 compensation for [[pain and suffering]] when a [[DNA test]] established that his ex-wife's paternity claim regarding their child was misattributed. When Mr. Doe, who had married Ms. Doe based on her paternity claim, began a lawsuit against a hospital for switching his child at birth, Ms. Doe claimed to having been pregnant with another man's baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-620927.html | work=CBS News | location=South Korea | title=Woman Ordered To Pay For Having Another Man's Baby | date=11 February 2009 | first=Brian | last=Bernbaum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
On 5 January 2015, the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]] (decision 5A_619 of 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.swissblawg.ch/2015/02/5a6192014-berechnung-der-einjahrigen.html |title=5A_619/2014: Berechnung der einjährigen Frist zur Anfechtung der Vaterschaftsanerkennung |trans-title=Calculation of the one-year period for contesting paternity recognition |first=Sabine |last=Herzog |work=swissblawg.ch |date=9 February 2015 |accessdate=23 March 2015 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;) decided on a case wherein a plaintiff challenged the paternity of his (alleged) daughter. The plaintiff had his sperm examined in November 2009. As a result of the examination, the plaintiff’s fertility was found to be 3%. The court contended that the alleged father should have started investigating his paternity as a consequence of that finding. The plaintiff actually had his non-paternity confirmed via DNA evidence in 2013 upon failure of his marriage. The court held that the one year time limit under [[Swiss civil code]] article 260c for filing an action lapsed due to the plaintiff’s (the alleged father’s) inactivity for more than two years. The [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]] thus confirmed the ruling by the first instance and dismissed the appeal. It follows that the plaintiff’s financial obligations as to his (alleged) daughter will not change.

===United Kingdom===

In the [[United Kingdom]], paternity fraud, like adultery, is not a criminal offence&lt;ref name = "tel1"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/fatherhood/11839479/Should-we-be-doing-more-to-expose-paternity-fraud.html Should we be doing more to expose paternity fraud?] Published in The Telegraph, 4 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; except in the case of the lineage of the children of the British monarch under the [[Treason Act 1351]] where the adulterers are punishable as adultering against the lineage of the King with the King's "companion, ... or the wife of the King's eldest son and heir". Knowingly making a false statement on a public document is a criminal offence, including naming someone who is not the biological father. As of 2008, no individual has been prosecuted in a case involving paternity fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/01/freedomofinformation.childprotection DNA testing: One in 500 fathers wrongly identified by mothers in Child Support Agency claims] Published in [[The Guardian]], 1st August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A mother is permitted to not state the name of the biological father if she does not know it.&lt;ref name="Draper"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Draper |first=Heather |year=2005 |title=Paternity fraud and compensation for misattributed paternity |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=475–480 |doi=10.1136/jme.2005.013268 |pmid=17664309 |pmc=2598159}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paternity fraud is a form of [[Non-paternity event|misattributed paternity]].&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt;

The split in 2002 between a couple, identified for legal reasons as Mr. A and Ms. B, prompted Mr. A to pursue a parental contract to establish his non-married rights as their child's father.  Ms. B then requested a [[DNA test]] that later showed Mr. A was not the (then) five year old's father. Following the discovery Mr. A then sued Ms. B for damages of up to £100,000 as a result of the deceit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1547568/Lover-must-pay-broker-for-claiming-son-was-his.html | work=The Telegraph | location=London, United Kingdom | title=Lover must pay broker for claiming son was his | date=4 April 2007 | first=Amy | last=Iggulden }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2007 in what was reported as the first known case of its kind to reach trial in Britain, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled in favor of {{not a typo|Mr. A}} awarding £7,500 distress damages with another £14,943 for holidays and meals out Mr. A spent on Ms. B (not the child). The judgment fell short of listed suit amount because the London court did not allow damages for the child's material costs incurred because of Mr. A's enjoyment of the relationship. The judge, [[John Blofeld (judge)|Sir John Blofeld]], said he was satisfied that Mr. A's motivation in coming to court was not as a lever for contact with the child but because he did not want "to be taken for a ride".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/04/law.world | work=The Guardian | location=London, United Kingdom | title=Stockbroker wins £22,000 damages for paternity deceit | date=3 April 2007 | first=Karen  | last=McVeigh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States has historically imposed a strong presumption of marital paternity, and has also imposed barriers to paternity challenges once paternity has been legally established. In more recent years, especially since the advent of DNA testing, laws and guidelines have been proposed or enacted that may allow for a paternity challenge by a legal father who later determines he is not a child's biological father, or by a biological father who learns that somebody else has been named on a child's birth certificate as the child's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580398-1,00.html | work=Time Magazine | location=United States | title=Duped Dads Fight Back | date=19 January 2007 | first=Julie | last=Rawe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2003/Dec-08-Mon-2003/news/22741969.html | work=Review-Journal | location=Las Vegas, Nevada | title=Movement targets `paternity fraud' | date=8 December 2003 | first=Richard | last=Lake }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
In the case of ''County of Los Angeles v. Navarro'', in 1996, the County of Los Angeles entered a default judgment against putative father Mr. Navarro and ordered him to pay monthly support for Ms. Doe's two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16132321968914865606 | work=scholar.google | location=California, United States | title=County of Los Angeles v. Navarro | date=30 June 2004 | first=Court of | last=Appeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The complaint to establish paternity filed by the Bureau of Family Support Operations was based on information provided by Ms. Doe naming "Manuel Nava" as the children's father. The agency determined that Mr. Navarro was the father in question and delivered notice to his sister's residence listing Mr. Navarro as "co-resident", a notice Mr. Navarro denied ever receiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,125579,00.html | work=Fox News | location=United States | title=Paternity: Innocence Is Now a Defense | date=14 July 2004 | first=Wendy | last=McElroy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Mr. Navarro, armed with a DNA test showing he was not the children's father, sued the County of Los Angeles asking to be relieved from the support order.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/jan/15/20050115-115942-7925r/?page=all | work=Washington Times | location=United States | title=Law aids paternity fraud victims | date=15 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The County of Los Angeles opposed the motion, arguing the motion was filed after the six month limit to contest a default judgment and the mother’s mere assertion that he was the father was insufficient to establish extrinsic fraud. The trial court sided with the County and denied the motion. This ruling was then appealed before the California 2nd Appellate Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5156427484382718804 | work=Case Law [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/b155166.pdf County of L.A. v.

Navarro, Cal: Court of Appeal, 2nd Appellate Dist., 8th Div. 2004 | date=30 June 2004 | first=California | last=Court of Appeal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the court of appeal reversed the trial court decision ruling in favor of Mr. Navarro and became the first published California case to hold that the [[statute of limitations]] did not apply in setting aside an old default judgment against a paternity fraud victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/aug/18/20040818-111309-3555r/?page=all | work=Washington Times | location=United States | title=Court asked to ‘depublish’ child-support ruling | date=18 August 2004 | first=Staff | last=Writer }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately after the ruling was issued, the Los Angeles County Child Support Services Department announced that it would request that the case be depublished so it could not be used as a precedent by other men in Mr. Navarro's situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/California+agency+will+seek+to+depublish+paternity+ruling.-a0125336142 | work=American Association for Justice | location=Trial Magazine | title=California agency will seek to depublish paternity ruling | date=1 November 2004 | first=Sileo | last=Carmel }}&lt;/ref&gt; That request was later denied by the [[California Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/jan/15/20050115-115942-7925r | work=The Washington Times | title=Law aids paternity fraud victims | date=15 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florida====
In the case of ''Parker v. Parker'', as part of their 2001 Florida divorce settlement Mr. Parker was obliged to pay $1200 monthly child support based on Ms. Parker's representations to the court that Mr. Parker was the child's biological father. In 2003 Ms. Parker filed a motion for contempt and a petition to enforce child support against Mr. Parker which prompted a DNA test showing that Mr. Parker was not the child's biological father.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15319835621860114145&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,48 | work=scholar.google | location=Florida, United States | title=Parker v. Parker, 916 So. 2d 926 | date=30 November 2005 | first=Florida Court of Appeal | last=Fourth District. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The motion was 16 months after their divorce, Florida law (at that time) only allowed the husband 12 months to contest paternity following divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/02/02/State/Court_backs_deadline_.shtml | work=Tampa Bay Times | location=Florida, United States | title=Court backs deadline for challenging paternity | date=2 February 2007 |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. Parker's court ordered payments would total about $216,000 over the next fifteen years.

Mr. Parker filed a petition for relief claiming that the misrepresentation of paternity had resulted in a fraudulent support order. This was dismissed by both the Trial and then, in 2005, the Court of Appeal as being intrinsic fraud and subject to the Florida one year time limit to contest a dissolution decree, not extrinsic fraud, or a fraud upon the court, that can form the basis for relief from judgment more than a year later. This ruling was then appealed before the Florida Supreme Court who, in 2007, denied Mr. Parker's suit upholding the Fourth District Court of Appeal 2005 ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2007/index.shtml | work=2007 Florida Supreme Court Decisions | location=[http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2007/sc05-2346.pdf Court Opinion] | title=SC05-2346 Parker v. Parker | date=1 February 2007 | first=Supreme Court of | last=Florida }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2006, the Florida statutes changed allowing a DNA test to be considered new evidence to contest a support order after the one year time limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2012/0742.18 | work=2012 Florida Statutes | location=Florida, United States | title=Florida Statutes, Title 43, Ch.742, Sec.18 | date=20 June 2006 | first=Florida | last=Senate }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In its published opinion the Supreme Court Ruling in 2007 noted the change in Florida Statutes, "which provides the circumstances and procedures under which a male may disestablish paternity and terminate a child support obligation," however the court decided not to consider the applicability of this new statute to Mr. Parker's circumstances, kicking the question of a retrial under the new law back to the Trial Courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0209/p01s01-usju.htm | work=Christian Science Monitor | location=Florida, United States | title=Dad wasn't dad after all, but still owes child support | date=9 February 2007 | first=Warren | last=Richey }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the basic facts are little questioned and the case explores differences between [[Extrinsic fraud|extrinsic]] and [[Intrinsic fraud|intrinsic]] fraud, other state Supreme Courts, including Iowa&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12677538385052883680&amp;q | work=scholar.google | location=Iowa S.C., United States | title=Dier v.

Hodge | date=1 October 2012 | first=Supreme Court of | last=Tennessee }}&lt;/ref&gt; have cited ''Parker v. Parker'' when writing opinions of their own for paternity fraud type cases.

====Iowa====
In 2012 the [[Iowa Supreme Court]] in ruling to allow a paternity fraud tort to proceed as they fall "within the traditional boundaries of fraud law", but advised caution in bringing cases, as they would be "hard to prove, emotional and embarrassing".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.thonline.com/news/iowa-illinois-wisconsin/article_d7e7f75a-97c0-5a35-9a38-ad1f698b74cc.html | work=Telegraph Herald | location=Dubuque, Iowa | title=Iowa court allows paternity-fraud lawsuit | date=2 June 2012 |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Mexico====

In the case of ''Barreras v. Trevino'', Mr. Barreras and Ms. Trevino divorced in 1999 with Ms. Trevino shortly afterwards gaining a support order for her supposed daughter with Mr. Barreras named as the putative father. In 2004 a New Mexico court ruled that the child Mr. Barreras had (up until then) paid $20,000 support to Ms. Trevino for did not actually exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=2a2451e124 | work=KOB-TV Eyewitness News | location=New Mexico, USA | title=Where's the Baby? | date=6 December 2004 | first=Mark | last=Horner }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. Barreras sued a DNA testing laboratory in 2006 for falsifying two separate DNA tests for the supposed child by using samples taken from his adult daughter who, along with one of the lab employees, also face fraud charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://kob.com/article/stories/S190773.shtml | work=NBC News | location=United States | title=Child support fraud case lands in 2 courtrooms | date=10 September 2007 | first=Jeremy | last=Jojola }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ms. Trevino pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges of fraud and perjury, and was sentenced to twenty-one years in prison. Trevino served 16 months in federal prison in Arizona for claiming the non-existent girl on tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.clipsyndicate.com/publish/video/658732/trevino_pleads_guilty_to_fraud_perjury | work=Clips Syndicate | location=NBC News, USA | title=Trevino pleads guilty to fraud, perjury | date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the paternity fraud Ms. Trevino was able to obtain a [[birth certificate]], [[Medicare (United States)|medicare card]] and [[Social Security (United States)|social security card]] for the fictitious girl prompting (then) [[Bill Richardson|Gov. Bill Richardson]] to direct New Mexico Department of Human Services to explain how several government agencies became not only unwitting partners in the fraud, but also resisted efforts to correct it.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,141525,00.html | work=Fox News | location=New Mexico, United States | title=Agency Culpable in Child Support Scam | date=17 December 2004 | first=Wendy | last=McElroy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Letters and calls from Mr. Barreras to the New Mexico child support agency about his vasectomy in 1998 were ignored and when the child support enforcement division's order to bring the supposed child in for more paternity tests were not complied with by Ms. Trevino the agency simply closed the case without further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.abqjournal.com/news/metro/272130metro12-12-04.htm | work=ABQ Journal | location=Albuquerque, New Mexico | title=Ex-husband Paid $20,000 To Support Nonexistent Daughter | date=12 December 2004 | first=Carolyn | last=Carlson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tennessee====

In the case of ''Hodge v. Craig'' in October 2012, intentional misrepresentation of paternity was recognized by a unanimous Tennessee Supreme Court in ''Hodge v. Craig'', a case where the mother intentionally lied to a man about who the father of the child was. Based on the mother's assurances the couple married but later divorced. The plaintiff dutifully paid child support including medical insurance for the child. Based on physical differences between himself and the child he obtained a tissue sample and confirmed his suspicions. Damages were awarded in compensation for child support paid for 15 years.&lt;ref name=Justia101612&gt;{{cite news|title=When Your Daddy Is Not Really Your Daddy: A Man Successfully Sues His Ex-Wife for Paternity Fraud Damages|url=http://verdict.justia.com/2012/10/16/when-your-daddy-is-not-really-your-daddy|accessdate=16 October 2012|newspaper=Justia.Com|date=16 October 2012|author=Joanna L. Grossman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's decision was based on the [[common law]] remedy of [[fraud|intentional misrepresentation]]; the court distinguished the award of damages from a retroactive modification of [[child support]].

==Criticism==
The topic of paternity fraud is controversial. In the ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', Heather Draper writes, "claims for reimbursement and compensation in cases of misattributed paternity produce the same distorted and thin view of what it means to be a father that paternity testing assumes, and underscores a trend that is not in the interests of children."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lyn Turner says that the concept of paternity fraud is about the "demonization of mothers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turney|first=Lyn|date=2011-12-01|title=The Denial of Paternity: Pregnancy as a Risk to the ‘Pure Relationship’|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038511416151|journal=Sociology|language=en|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1110–1125|doi=10.1177/0038038511416151|issn=0038-0385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Body plethysmography male subject.jpg|thumb|A man undergoing whole body plethysmography.]]
[[Image:Body Box.jpg|thumb|A modern body plethysmograph using ultrasound]]

A '''plethysmograph''' is an instrument for measuring changes in volume within an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] or whole body (usually resulting from fluctuations in the amount of blood or air it contains).

==Organs studied==

===Lungs===

Pulmonary plethysmographs are commonly used to measure the [[functional residual capacity]] (FRC) of the [[lung]]s—the volume in the lungs when the muscles of respiration are relaxed—and total lung capacity.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In a traditional plethysmograph, the test subject is placed inside a sealed chamber the size of a small telephone booth with a single mouthpiece.  At the end of normal expiration, the mouthpiece is closed.  The patient is then asked to make an inspiratory effort.  As the patient tries to inhale (a maneuver which looks and feels like panting), the lungs expand, decreasing pressure within the lungs and increasing lung volume. This, in turn, increases the pressure within the box since it is a closed system and the volume of the box compartment has decreased to accommodate the new volume of the subject.

==== Methodological approach ====
[[Boyle's Law]] is used to calculate the unknown volume within the lungs.  First, the change in volume of the chest is computed.  The initial pressure of the box times its volume is considered equal to the known pressure after expansion times the unknown new volume.  Once the new volume is found, the original volume minus the new volume is the change in volume in the box and also the change in volume in the chest.  With this information, Boyle's Law is used again to determine the original volume of gas in the chest: the initial volume (unknown) times the initial pressure is equal to the final volume times the final pressure. Starting from this principle, it can be shown&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111%2811%2900055-2/abstract|title = Body plethysmography – Its principles and clinical use|last = C.P. Criée|first = |date = 24 October 2015|journal = Respiratory Medicine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the functional residual capacity is a function of the changes in volume and pressures as follows:

&lt;math&gt;FRC = K_V \frac{\Delta V_{box}}{\Delta P_{mouth}} , K_V \approx P_{Barometric}&lt;/math&gt;

The difference between full and empty lungs can be used to assess diseases and airway passage restrictions.  An obstructive disease will show increased FRC because some airways do not empty normally, while a restrictive disease will show decreased FRC.  Body plethysmography is particularly appropriate for patients who have air spaces which do not  communicate with the bronchial tree; in such patients [[Helium dilution technique|helium dilution]] would give an incorrectly low reading.

Another important parameter, which can be calculated with a body plethysmograph is the airway resistance. During inhalation the chest expands, which increases the pressure within the box. While observing the so-called resistance loop (cabin pressure and flow), diseases can easily be recognized. If the resistance loop becomes planar, this shows a bad [[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]] of the lung. A [[COPD]], for instance, can easily be discovered because of the unique shape of the corresponding resistance loop.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Limbs===

Some plethysmograph devices are attached to [[arm]]s, [[human leg|leg]]s or other extremities and used to determine circulatory capacity.
In water plethysmography an extremity, e.g. an arm, is enclosed in a water-filled chamber where volume changes can be detected. Air plethysmography uses a similar principle but based on an air-filled long cuff, which is more convenient but less accurate.
Another practical device is mercury-filled strain gauges used to continuously measure circumference of the extremity, e.g. at mid calf.
[[Impedance plethysmography]] is a non-invasive method used to detect [[venous thrombosis]] in these areas of the body.

===Genitals===

Another common type of plethysmograph is the [[penile plethysmograph]]. This device is used to measure changes in blood flow in the [[penis]]. Although some researchers use this device to assess [[sexual arousal]] and [[sexual orientation]], "Courts that have considered penile plethysmography generally rule that the technique is not sufficiently reliable for use in court."&lt;ref name="myers"&gt;Myers JEB (2005). ''Myers on Evidence in Child, Domestic, and Elder Abuse Cases.'' Aspen Publishers Online {{ISBN|0-7355-5668-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An approximate female equivalent to penile plethysmography is [[vaginal photoplethysmography]], which optically measures blood flow in the vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/magazine/25desire-t.html?hp|title=What Do Women Want?|date=2009-01-22|author=Daniel Bergner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in preclinical research==
Plethysmography is a widely used method in basic and [[Pre-clinical development|preclinical research]] to study respiration. Several techniques are used:

===Respiratory parameters from conscious freely moving animals: whole-body plethysmography===
Whole-body plethysmography is used to measure respiratory parameters in conscious unrestrained subjects, including quantification of [[bronchoconstriction]].

The standard plethysmograph sizes are for the study of mice, rats and guinea pigs. On request, larger plethysmographs can also be manufactured for other animals, such as rabbits, dogs, pigs, or primates.

The plethysmograph has two chambers, each fitted with a [[Spirometry|pneumotachograph]]. The subject is placed in one of them (subject chamber) and the other remains empty (reference chamber).

The pressure change is measured by a differential pressure transducer with one port exposed to the subject chamber and the other to the reference chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Wang, Venkatraman Siddharthan, Kyle K. Kesler, Jeffery O. Hall, Neil E. Motter, Justin G. Julander and John D. Morrey (2013). Fatal Neurological Respiratory Insufficiency Is Common Among Viral Encephalitides [http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/208/4/573.long (free full text)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respiratory parameters from conscious restrained animals: double-chamber / head-out plethysmography===
The double-chamber plethysmograph (dcp) measures respiratory parameters in a conscious restrained subject, including [[airway resistance]] and conductance. Different sizes of plethysmograph exist to study mice, rats or guinea pigs.

The head-out configuration is identical to the standard configuration described above except that there is no head chamber.

Of course the collar seal is still applied, so that the body chamber remains airtight. With only a thoracic signal, all parameters can be obtained except for specific airway resistance (SRaw) and specific airway conductance (Sgaw).

===Resistance/compliance from sedated animals===

In anesthetized plethysmography, lung resistance and dynamic compliance are measured directly because the subject is anesthetized.

Depending on the level of sedation, the subject may be spontaneously breathing (SB configuration) or under mechanical ventilation (MV configuration).
A flow signal and a pressure signal are required to calculate compliance and resistance.

===Cerebral blood flow===

Cerebral venous blood flow has been recently studied trying to establish a connection between [[Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency]] and [[multiple sclerosis]]. The small study is not big enough to establish a conclusion, but some association has been shown.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Zamboni P, Menegatti E, Conforti P, Shepherd S, Tessari M, Beggs C.

In [[medicine]], '''precocious puberty''' is [[puberty]] occurring at an unusually early age. In most cases, the process is normal in every aspect except the unusually early age, and simply represents a [[human variability|variation]] of [[Human development (biology)|normal development]]. In a minority of children, the early development is triggered by a disease such as a [[tumor]] or [[brain injury|injury]] of the [[Human brain|brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/sexual/precocious.html#|title=Precocious Puberty|publisher=KidsHealth|accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when there is no disease, unusually early puberty can have adverse effects on social behavior and psychological development, can reduce adult [[human height|height]] potential, and may shift some lifelong health risks. Central precocious puberty can be treated by suppressing the [[pituitary]] [[hormone]]s that induce [[sex steroid]] production. The opposite condition is [[delayed puberty]].

The term is used with several slightly different meanings that are usually apparent from the context. In its broadest sense, and often simplified as '''early puberty''', "precocious puberty" sometimes refers to any physical [[sex steroid|sex hormone]] effect, due to any cause, occurring earlier than the usual age, especially when it is being considered as a medical problem. Stricter definitions of "precocity" may refer only to central puberty starting before a statistically specified age based on percentile in the population (e.g., 2.5 standard deviations below the population mean),&lt;ref name="MeshName |precocious+puberty"&gt;{{MeshName|precocious+puberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; on expert recommendations of ages at which there is more than a negligible chance of discovering an abnormal cause, or based on opinion as to the age at which early puberty may have adverse effects. A common definition for medical purposes is onset before 8 years in girls or 9 years in boys.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/000956207|precocious puberty}}{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
''Pubertas praecox'' is the [[Latin]] term used by physicians in the 19th century. Early [[pubic hair]], [[breast]], or [[genital]] development may result from natural early maturation or from several other conditions.

=== Central ===
If the cause can be traced to the [[hypothalamus]] or [[pituitary]], the cause is considered central. Other names for this type are ''complete'' or ''true precocious'' puberty.&lt;ref&gt;David Gardner, Dolores Shoback. Basic And Clinical Endocrinology. McGraw-Hill Medical; 2011. 9th Edition. Pg. 550&lt;/ref&gt;

Causes of central precocious puberty can include:
* damage to the inhibitory system of the brain (due to [[infection]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], or [[irradiation]]),
* [[Tuber cinereum hamartoma|hypothalamic hamartoma]] produces pulsatile [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH),
* [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]], or
* [[McCune–Albright syndrome]].

Central precocious puberty can be caused by intracranial neoplasm, infection (most commonly central nervous system tuberculosis especially in developing countries), trauma, hydrocephalus, and [[Angelman syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dickerman | first1 = R.

Precocious puberty can make a child fertile when very young, with the youngest mother on record being [[Lina Medina]], who gave birth at the age of 5 years, 7 months and 17 days, in one report&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Six decades later, world’s youngest mother awaits aid|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1020827/asp/foreign/story_1140311.asp|work=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]|date=August 27, 2002|accessdate=April 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iJ65vfQ8?url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1020827/asp/foreign/story_1140311.asp|archivedate=July 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at 6 years 5 months in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893791,00.html | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' | title=Little Mother | date=December 16, 1957 | accessdate=January 9, 2008 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iJ7D1EHq?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893791,00.html | archivedate=July 16, 2009 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Central precocious puberty (CPP) was reported in some patients with suprasellar [[arachnoid cysts]] (SAC), and SCFE ([[slipped capital femoral epiphysis]]) occurs in patients with CPP because of rapid growth and changes of growth hormone secretion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamato|first=Fumiko|author2=Takaya, Junji |author3=Higashino, Hirohiko |author4=Yamanouchi, Yasuo |author5=Suehara, Hiroshi |author6= Kobayashi, Yohnosuke |title=Slipped capital femoral epiphysis during the treatment of precocious puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone-agonist: aetiological considerations|journal=European Journal of Pediatrics|date=March 2005|volume=164|issue=3|pages=173–174|doi=10.1007/s00431-004-1578-7|pmid=15592875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If no cause can be identified, it is considered [[idiopathic]] or constitutional.

=== Peripheral ===
Secondary sexual development induced by [[sex steroid]]s from other abnormal sources is referred to as ''peripheral precocious puberty'' or ''precocious pseudopuberty.'' It typically presents as a severe form of disease with children. Symptoms are usually as a sequelae from adrenal insufficiency (because of [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency|21-hydroxylase deficiency]] or [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency|11-beta hydroxylase deficiency]], the former being more common), which includes but is not limited to hypertension, hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, ambiguous genitalia in females, signs of virilization in females. Blood tests will typically reveal high level of [[androgen]]s with low levels of cortisol.

Causes can include:
* Endogenous sources
** [[gonad]]al tumors (such as [[arrhenoblastoma]]),
** [[adrenal]] tumors,
** [[germ cell tumor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Masse | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = P.

** [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]],
** [[McCune–Albright syndrome]],
* Exogenous hormones
** [[Environmental exogenous hormones]],
** As treatment for another condition.

=== Isosexual and heterosexual ===
Generally, patients with precocious puberty develop [[phenotype|phenotypically]] appropriate [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s. This is called ''isosexual'' precocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarzabek-Bielecka|first1=G|last2=Warchoł-Biedermann|first2=K|last3=Sowińska|first3=E|last4=Wachowiak-Ochmańska|first4=K|title=[Precocious puberty].|journal=Ginekologia polska|date=April 2011|volume=82|issue=4|pages=281–6|pmid=21735696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a patient may develop in the opposite direction. For example, a male may [[gynecomastia|develop breasts]] and other feminine characteristics, while a female may develop a deepened voice and facial hair. This is called ''heterosexual'' or ''contrasexual'' precocity. It is very rare in comparison to isosexual precocity and is usually the result of unusual circumstances. As an example, children with a very rare genetic condition called [[aromatase excess syndrome]] in which exceptionally high circulating levels of estrogen are present usually develop precocious puberty. Males and females are hyperfeminized by the syndrome.

=== Research ===
Many causes of early puberty are somewhat unclear, though girls who have a high-fat diet and are not physically active or are [[Obesity|obese]] are more likely to physically mature earlier.&lt;ref name="Tanner"&gt;(Tanner, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kaplowitz | first1 = P.

High levels of beta-hCG in serum and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] observed in a 9-year-old boy suggest a pineal gland tumor. The tumor is called a ''chorionic [[gonadotropin]] secreting [[pineal]] tumor''. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy reduced tumor and beta-hCG levels normalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kuo | first1 = H. C. | last2 = Sheen | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Wu | first3 = K.

Mutations in the kisspeptin (KISS1) and its receptor, KISS1R (also known as GPR54), involved in GnRH secretion and puberty onset, are also thought to be the cause for ICPP&lt;ref name="pmid21664234"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teles|first=Milena Gurgel|author2=Silveira, Leticia Ferreira Gontijo |author3=Tusset, Cintia |author4= Latronico, Ana Claudia |title=New genetic factors implicated in human GnRH-dependent precocious puberty: The role of kisspeptin system|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|date=1 October 2011|volume=346|issue=1–2|pages=84–90|doi=10.1016/j.mce.2011.05.019|pmid=21664234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20237166"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silveira|first=LG |author2=Noel, SD |author3=Silveira-Neto, AP |author4=Abreu, AP |author5=Brito, VN |author6=Santos, MG |author7=Bianco, SD |author8=Kuohung, W |author9=Xu, S |author10=Gryngarten, M |author11=Escobar, ME |author12=Arnhold, IJ |author13=Mendonca, BB |author14=Kaiser, UB |author15=Latronico, AC|title=Mutations of the KISS1 gene in disorders of puberty|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|date=May 2010|volume=95|issue=5|pages=2276–80|doi=10.1210/jc.2009-2421|pmid=20237166|pmc=2869552}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is still a controversial area of research, and some investigators found no association of mutations in the LIN28 and KISS1/KISS1R genes to be the common cause underlying ICPP.&lt;ref name="pmid21939553"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tommiska|first=Johanna|author2=Sørensen, Kaspar |author3=Aksglaede, Lise |author4=Koivu, Rosanna |author5=Puhakka, Lea |author6=Juul, Anders |author7= Raivio, Taneli |title=LIN28B, LIN28A, KISS1, and KISS1R in idiopathic central precocious puberty|journal=BMC Research Notes|date=1 January 2011|volume=4|issue=1|pages=363|doi=10.1186/1756-0500-4-363|pmid=21939553|pmc=3184284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gene MKRN3, which is a maternally imprinted gene, was first cloned by Jong et al in 1999.  MKRN3 was originally named Zinc finger protein 127.  It is located on human chromosome 15 on the long arm in the Prader-Willi syndrome critical region2, and has since been identified as a cause of premature sexual development or CPP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abreu AP, Dauber A, Macedo DB, Noel SD, Brito VN, Gill JC, Cukier P, Thompson IR, Navarro VM, Gagliardi PC, etal | year = 2013 | title = Central precocious puberty caused by mutations in the imprinted gene MKRN3 | doi = 10.1056/nejmoa1302160| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 368 | issue = | pages = 2467–2475 | pmc = 3808195 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of mutations in MKRN3 leading to sporadic cases of CPP has been a significant contribution to better understanding the mechanism of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macedo DB, Abreu AP, Reis AC, Montenegro LR, Dauber A, Beneduzzi D, Cukier P, Silveira LF, Teles MG, Carroll RS, etal | year = 2014 | title = Central precocious puberty that appears to be sporadic caused by paternally inherited mutations in the imprinted gene makorin ring finger 3 | url = | journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = E1097–1103 | doi=10.1210/jc.2013-3126| pmc = 4037732}}&lt;/ref&gt; MKRN3 appears to act as a "brake" on the central hypothalamic-pituitary access.  Thus, loss of function mutations of the protein allow early activation of the GnRH pathway and cause phenotypic CPP. Patients with a MKRN3 mutation all display the classic signs of CCP including early breast and testes development, increased bone aging and elevated hormone levels of GnRH and LH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abreu AP, Macedo DB, Brito VN, etal | year = 2015 | title = A new pathway in the control of the initiation of puberty: the MKRN3 gene | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Endocrinology | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = R131–R139 | doi=10.1530/jme-14-0315| pmc = 4573396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

Studies indicate that breast development in girls and the appearance of pubic hair in girls and boys are starting earlier than in previous generations.&lt;ref name=ncbi/&gt;&lt;ref name="adc.bmj.com"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zukauskaite | first1 = S. | last2 = Lasiene | first2 = D. | last3 = Lasas | first3 = L. | last4 = Urbonaite | first4 = B. | last5 = Hindmarsh | first5 = P. | title = Onset of breast and pubic hair development in 1231 preadolescent Lithuanian schoolgirls | doi = 10.1136/adc.2004.057612 | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 90 | issue = 9 | pages = 932–936 | year = 2005 | pmid =  15855182| pmc =1720558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michelle |last=Roberts |title=Why puberty now begins at seven|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-05-15|accessdate=2010-05-22|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4530743.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, "early puberty" in children, particularly girls, as young as 9 and 10 is no longer considered abnormal, although it may be upsetting to parents&lt;ref name=www.msnbc.msn.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.suntimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Ritter|title=Parents worried by girls' earlier start of puberty|publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''|date=2000-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be harmful to children who mature physically at a time when they are immature mentally.&lt;ref name="www.center4research.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.center4research.org/early-puberty-girls/|title=Early Puberty in Girls|author=Diana Zuckerman |publisher=Cornell University Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors |year=2001 |work=The Ribbon |accessdate=18 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No age reliably separates normal from abnormal processes in children, but the following age thresholds for evaluation are thought to minimize the risk of missing a significant medical problem:
*Breast development in boys before appearance of pubic hair or [[testicle|testicular]] enlargement,
*[[Pubic hair]] or genital enlargement ([[gonadarche]]) in boys with onset before 9.5 years,
*Pubic hair ([[pubarche]]) before 8 or breast development ([[thelarche]]) in girls with onset before 7 years,
*[[Menstruation]] ([[menarche]]) in girls before 10 years.

Medical evaluation is sometimes necessary to recognize the few children with serious conditions from the majority who have entered puberty early but are still medically normal. Early sexual development warrants evaluation because it may:
*induce early [[bone maturation]] and reduce eventual adult height,
*indicate the presence of a tumour or other serious problem,
*cause the child, particularly a girl, to become an object of adult sexual interest.&lt;ref name=newscientist.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stattin &amp; Magnussion"&gt;(Stattin &amp; Magnussion, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mendle"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mendle J, Leve L, Van Ryzin M, Natsuaki M | title = Linking Childhood Maltreatment With Girls' Internalizing Symptoms: Early Puberty as a Tipping Point | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 626–30 |date=August 2013 |doi=10.1111/jora.12075| url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jora.12075/abstract |pmc=4236856 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==

Early puberty is believed to put girls at [[Child sexual abuse|higher risk of sexual abuse]],&lt;ref name=newscientist.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mendle"/&gt; unrelated to [[pedophilia]] because the child has developed [[secondary sex characteristic]]s; however, a causal relationship is, as yet, inconclusive.&lt;ref name="Mendle"/&gt; Early puberty also puts girls at a higher risk for teasing or bullying, mental health disorders and short stature as adults.&lt;ref name=newscientist.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stattin &amp; Magnussion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caspi"&gt;(Caspi et al.1993: Lanza and Collins, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Helping children control their weight is suggested to help delay puberty. Early puberty additionally puts girls at a "far greater" risk for [[breast cancer]] later in life{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. Girls as young as 8 are increasingly starting to [[Menstruation|menstruate]], develop breasts and grow pubic and underarm hair; these "biological milestones" typically occurred only at 13 or older in the past.  African-American girls are especially prone to early puberty.&lt;ref name=ncbi/&gt; There are theories debating the trend of early puberty, but the exact causes are not known.

Though boys face fewer problems upon early puberty than girls, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them.&lt;ref name="Garn"&gt;Garn, SM. Physical growth and development. In: Friedman SB, Fisher M, Schonberg SK, editors. Comprehensive Adolescent Health Care. St Louis: Quality Medical Publishing; 1992. Retrieved on 2009-02-20&lt;/ref&gt; Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, although their [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[social development]] may lag behind their appearance.&lt;ref name=Garn/&gt; Studies have shown that early maturing boys are more likely to be sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviours.&lt;ref name=Susman&gt;Susman, EJ; Dorn, LD; Schiefelbein, VL.

== Treatment ==
One possible treatment is with [[anastrozole]]. [[Histrelin]], [[triptorelin]], or [[leuprorelin]], any GnRH agonists, may be used. Non-continuous usage of GnRH agonists stimulates the pituitary gland to release [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH).&lt;ref name=nejm_PP&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Florence Comite]]|first=|author2=Cutler, Gordon B. |author3=Rivier, Jean |author4=Vale, Wylie W. |author5=Loriaux, D.

Prolonged use has a risk of causing osteoporosis. After stopping GnRH agonists, pubertal changes resume within 3 to 12 months.

'''Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy''' (PACT) is a programme created by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) in 2004 to build upon the Agency’s experience in radiation medicine and technology, and enable [[developing countries]] to introduce, expand or improve their [[cancer care]] capacity and services in a sustainable manner by integrating [[radiotherapy]] into a comprehensive cancer control programme that maximizes its therapeutic effectiveness and impact. Such a programme integrates and aligns cancer prevention, surveillance, screening and early detection, treatment and palliative care activities and investments, and is set up based on the Guidelines of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). It also addresses other challenges such as infrastructure gaps and, through partnerships, builds capacity and long term support for continuous education and training of cancer care professionals, as well as for community-based civil society action to combat cancer.

PACT has its headquarters in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].

PACT and its partners are developing multidisciplinary cancer capacity building projects called PACT Model Demonstration Sites (PMDS).  As of 2010, there are eight PMDS: [[Albania]], [[Ghana]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Sri Lanka]],  [[United Republic of Tanzania]], [[Vietnam]] and the Republic of [[Yemen]].

'''''Queer Crips: Disabled Gay Men and Their Stories''''' is a 2004 anthology edited by Bob Guter and John R. Killacky. The book is a  collection of personal stories from gay men with disabilities. The stories are told through a variety of literary genres, including poetry, prose, and interviews. The book won the [[2004 Lambda Literary Awards|2004 Lambda Literary Award]] for the Anthologies/Non-fiction category. Contributors to the book include gay men such as [[Greg Walloch]], [[Kenny Fries]], [[J. Quinn Brisben]], and [[Eli Clare]]. After being turned down for publication by 30 publishers, the anthology was finally published by Harrington Park Press, an imprint of [[Haworth Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Gay-disabled-and-with-a-lot-to-talk-about-2788997.php |title=Gay, disabled and with a lot to talk about |publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-01 |first=Heidi |last=Benson |date=2004-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The ''Disability Studies Quarterly'', the publication of the [[Society for Disability Studies]], wrote a review of ''Queer Crips'', stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While Queer Crips can definitely boast of well-crafted, gorgeous poetry, there are a few exceptions. Perhaps it is only a matter of taste, but some of the poetry is of the cathartic type without the "craft" elements of formal published poetry or the spectacle of a performance piece. However, what is great about including such poetry is that it elevates all expressions of feeling and, in a sense, truly captures the sharing of the soul that poetry is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/518/695 |title=BOOK &amp; FILM REVIEWS |publisher=''[[Society for Disability Studies|Disability Studies Quarterly]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the book ''Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability'', [[Robert McRuer]] notes that the stories in ''Queer Crips'' are "nonheteronormative in their broadest sense" and that it is "striking how much the convergence of disability and homosexuality in "Queer Crips" appears to authorize erotic inventiveness and play". McRuer further writes that the anthology implicitly draws a parallel between [[compulsory heterosexuality]] and "compulsory able-bodiedness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last= McRuer|first= Robert|authorlink= |year= 2006|publisher= [[New York University Press]]|location= [[New York City]]|isbn= 0-814-75712-X|page= |pages= 243–4|accessdate=October 1, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cdNb_XJrPwwC&amp;pg=PA243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct''''' is a 1961 book by the psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]], in which the author criticizes [[psychiatry]] and argues against the concept of mental illness. It received much publicity, and has become a classic, well known as an argument against the tendency of psychiatrists to label people who are "disabled by living" as "mentally ill".

==Background==
Szasz writes that he became interested in writing ''The Myth of Mental Illness'' in approximately 1950, when, having become established as a psychiatrist, he became convinced that the concept of mental illness was vague and unsatisfactory. He began work on the book in 1954, when he was relieved of the burdens of a full-time psychiatric practice by being called to active duty in the navy. Later in the 1950s, it was rejected by the first publisher to whom Szasz submitted the manuscript. Szasz next sent the manuscript to Paul Hoeber, director of the medical division of Harper &amp; Brothers, who arranged for it to be published.&lt;ref name="Szasz"&gt;{{cite book |author=Szasz, Thomas S. |title=The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |year=1974 |page=vii, xiii, xvi |isbn=0-06-091151-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
Szasz argues that it does not make sense to classify psychological problems as diseases or illnesses, and that speaking of "mental illness" involves a logical or conceptual error.&lt;ref name="Ruse" /&gt; In his view, the term "mental illness" is an inappropriate metaphor and there are no true illnesses of the mind.&lt;ref name="Zilbergeld" /&gt; His position has been characterized as involving a rigid distinction between the physical and the mental.&lt;ref name="Ruse" /&gt;

The legitimacy of psychiatry is questioned by Szasz, who compares it to [[alchemy]] and [[astrology]],&lt;ref name="NYTIMES" /&gt; and argues that it offends the values of autonomy and liberty.&lt;ref name="Breggin"&gt;{{cite book |author=Breggin, Peter R. |title=Toxic Psychiatry: Why Therapy, Empathy, and Love Must Replace the Drugs, Electroshock, and Biochemical Theories of the "New Psychiatry" |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |year=1991 |page=415 |isbn=0-312-05975-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Szasz believes that the concept of mental illness is not only logically absurd but has harmful consequences: instead of treating cases of ethical or legal deviation as occasions when a person should be taught personal responsibility, attempts are made to "cure" the deviants, for example by giving them [[tranquilizer]]s.&lt;ref name="Ruse" /&gt; [[Psychotherapy]] is regarded by Szasz as useful not to help people recover from illnesses, but to help them "learn about themselves, others, and life."&lt;ref name="Zilbergeld"&gt;{{cite book |author=Zilbergeld, Bernie |title=The Shrinking of America: Myths of Psychological Change |publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Company |location=Boston |year=1983 |pages=78–79 |isbn=0-316-98794-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] and [[hysteria]], Szasz argues that hysteria is an emotional problem and that Charcot's patients were not really ill.&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt;

==Reception==
''The Myth of Mental Illness'' is a well known argument against the tendency of psychiatrists to label people who are "disabled by living" as mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt; It received much publicity, quickly became a classic,&lt;ref name="Zilbergeld" /&gt; and made Szasz a prominent figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-thomas-szasz-20120917-1-story.html |title=Dr. Thomas Szasz dies at 92; psychiatrist who attacked profession |author=Maugh II, Thomas H. |date= September 17, 2012  |work=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reviewed in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kahn, Eugene|title=The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct|journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=1 November 1962|volume=119|issue=5|pages=494|url=|doi=10.1176/ajp.119.5.494}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Glaser, Frederick|title=The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct|journal=[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]|date=May 1962|volume=134|issue=5|pages=477–484|url=http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Citation/1962/05000/The_Myth_of_Mental_Illness__Foundations_of_a.12.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Psychosomatic Medicine (journal)|Psychosomatic Medicine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shands, Harley|title=The Myth of Mental Illness|journal=[[Psychosomatic Medicine (journal)|Psychosomatic Medicine]]|date=May 1962|volume=24|issue=3|pages=322–323|url=http://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Citation/1962/05000/The_Myth_of_Mental_Illness_.23.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Archives of General Psychiatry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ruesch, Jurgen|title=The Myth of Mental Illness|journal=[[Archives of General Psychiatry]]|date=January 1962|volume=6|issue=1|pages=103–105|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1962.01710190105015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Clinical Psychology Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dammann, Eric|title="The myth of mental illness:" continuing controversies and their implications for mental health professionals|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|date=November 1997|volume=17|issue=7|pages=733–756|doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(97)00030-5|pmid=9397335}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Psychologies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leontev, Dmitry [Дмитрий Леонтьев]|script-title=ru:Расширить границы нормального|trans-title=Broadening the boundaries of normality|journal=[[Psychologies]]|date=16 April 2010|volume=|issue=47|pages=|url=http://www.psychologies.ru/observers/leontev-dmitriy/rasshirit-granitsyi-normalnogo/|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published at a vulnerable moment for psychiatry, when Freudian theorizing was just beginning to fall out of favor and the field was trying to become more medically oriented and empirically based, the book provided an intellectual foundation for [[mental patient]] advocates and [[anti-psychiatry]] activists. It became well known in the [[mental health]] professions and was favorably received by those sceptical of modern psychiatry, but placed Szasz in conflict with many doctors.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/health/dr-thomas-szasz-psychiatrist-who-led-movement-against-his-field-dies-at-92.html |title=Dr. Thomas Szasz, Psychiatrist Who Led Movement Against His Field, Dies at 92 |author=Carey, Benedict |date= September 11, 2012  |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after ''The Myth of Mental Illness'' was published, the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene demanded, in a letter citing the book, that Szasz be dismissed from his university position because he did not accept the concept of mental illness.&lt;ref name="Szasz" /&gt;

The philosopher [[Karl Popper]], in a 1961 letter to Szasz, called the book admirable and fascinating, adding that, "It is a most important book, and it marks a real revolution."&lt;ref name=Buchanan-Barker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan-Barker|first1=P|last2=Barker|first2=P|title=The convenient myth of Thomas Szasz|journal=[[Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing]]|date=February 2009|volume=16|issue=1|pages=87–95|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2850.2008.01310.x|pmid=19192090|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychiatrist [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]] wrote that ''The Myth of Mental Illness'', like [[R. D. Laing]]'s ''The Divided Self'' (1960), proved stimulating in the development of anti-psychiatry, though he noted that neither book is itself an anti-psychiatric work. He described Szasz's work as "a decisive, carefully documented demystification of psychiatric diagnostic labelling in general."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cooper, David |title=The Language of Madness |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |year=1978 |pages=128–129 |isbn=0-7139-1118-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist author [[Peter Sedgwick]], writing in 1982, commented that in ''The Myth of Mental Illness'', Szasz expounded a "game-playing model of social interaction" which is "zestful and insightful" but "neither particularly uncommon nor particularly iconoclastic by the standards of recent social-psychological theorising." Sedgwick argued that many of Szasz's observations are valuable regardless of the validity of Szasz's rejection of the concept of mental illness, and could easily be accepted by psychotherapists. Although agreeing with Szasz that the assignation of mental illness could undermine individual responsibility, he noted that this did not constitute an objection to the concept itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sedgwick, Peter |title=PsychoPolitics |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London |year=1987 |pages=150-2 |isbn=0 86104 352 9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Michael Ruse]], writing in ''[[Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry]]'' (1988), called Szasz the most forceful proponent of the thesis that mental illness is a myth, but while sympathetic to Szasz, considered his case over-stated. Ruse criticized Szasz's arguments on several grounds, maintaining that while the concepts of disease and illness were originally applied only to the physiological realm, they can properly be extended to the mind, and there is no logical absurdity involved in doing so.&lt;ref name="Ruse"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ruse, Michael |title=Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=1988 |pages=207–208 |isbn=0-631-15275-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Lewes wrote that Szasz's book is the most notable example of the "critique of the institutions of psychiatry and psychoanalysis" that occurred as part of the "general upheaval of values in the 1960s", though he saw the work as less profound than [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewes, Kenneth |title=Psychoanalysis and Male Homosexuality |publisher=Jason Aronson Inc |location=Northvale, New Jersey |year=1995 |pages=201 |isbn=1-56821-484-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychiatrist [[Peter Breggin]] called ''The Myth of Mental Illness'' a seminal work.&lt;ref name="Breggin" /&gt; [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]], writing in ''[[Why Freud Was Wrong]]'' (1995), observed that while some of Szasz's arguments are similar to his, he disagreed with Szasz's view that hysteria was an emotional problem and that Charcot's patients were not genuinely mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=595–596 |isbn=0-9515922-5-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyer [[Linda Hirshman]] wrote that while few psychiatrists adopted the views Szasz expounded in ''The Myth of Mental Illness'', the book helped to encourage a revision of their diagnostic and therapeutic claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hirshman, Linda |title=Victory: The Triumphant Gay Revolution |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2012 |page=136 |isbn=978-0-06-196550-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Lillian Faderman]] called Szasz's book the most notable attack on psychiatry published in the 1960s, adding that "Szasz's insights and critiques would prove invaluable to the [[homophile]] movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Faderman, Lillian |title=The Gay Revolution: The Story of the Struggle |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |year=2015 |pages=282-3 |isbn=978-1-4516-9411-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9186">'''Toxics use reduction''' is an approach to [[pollution]] prevention that targets and measures reductions in the upfront use of toxic materials. Toxics use reduction emphasizes the more preventive aspects of source reduction but, due to its emphasis on toxic chemical inputs, has been opposed more vigorously by chemical manufacturers. Toxics use reduction (TUR) can be subdivided into direct and indirect. Direct use focuses on substituting inputs in the production process and redesigning products to use less or no toxic chemicals. In the indirect process, there are process modifications, operation improvements, and recycling of chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;eea (2011-10-06).

== History ==

In the United States, toxics use reduction programs were set up by some state legislatures during the early 1990s, including in [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Oregon]]. Program elements may include mandatory reporting of toxic chemical use, reduction planning requirements, research and technical assistance. In the mid-1990s, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] considered toxics use reporting or materials accounting as an expansion of the public [[right to know]] on toxic chemical use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/tri/programs/trip3v6.htm EPA TRI: Issues Paper #3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Congress issued the [[Pollution Prevention Act of 1990]] to try to reduce toxins. Though the restrictions are limited, it is still practiced in over thirty states.&lt;ref&gt;http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/ovic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=OVIC&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Reference&amp;limiter=&amp;currPage=&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;source=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;action=e&amp;catId=&amp;activityType=&amp;scanId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CCV2644151399&lt;/ref&gt; The agency issued an advance notice of its proposed rule making in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/tri/programs/anprpre.htm EPA TRI: Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking FR Notice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; though toxics use reporting was not adopted.

== Toxics Use Reduction Act  ==

The Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Act (TURA) program of 1989 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mass.gov/toxics-use-reduction-act-tura-program Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Act (TURA) program]&lt;/ref&gt; requires facilities that use large amounts of toxic chemicals are required to report on their chemical use, conduct toxics use reduction planning every two years, and pay a fee. The fees paid by TURA filers support the work of the TURA implementing agencies, and are used to provide a wide variety of services to toxics users, including education, training, grant programs and technical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/ "Mass.gov"]. ''Mass.gov''. Retrieved 2017-11-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The  Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mass.gov/guides/massdep-toxics-use-reduction-program Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection]&lt;/ref&gt; the Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.turi.org/content Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Massachusetts Office of Technical Assistance and Technology (OTA)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mass.gov/orgs/office-of-technical-assistance-and-technology Massachusetts Office of Technical Assistance and Technology (OTA)]&lt;/ref&gt; implement the goals of TURA.

In Europe, attention to toxics use reduction may be seen in the [[European Union]]'s new regulatory framework (adopted 2003) &lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach.htm&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/06/12/action_on_toxic_crisis/ Action on toxic crisis - The Boston Globe - Boston.com - Op-ed - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin America and Asia ==

Latin America and Asia have industrialized at tremendous rates over the past decades. In doing so, governments focused on output to develop the economy while not paying attention to the environment. This has resulted in toxic accumulation in the land and in water sources. Organisations such as Clean Production Action have published resources for activists to formulate strategies to lobby governments for a less toxic producing industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;Action, Clean Production. [http://cleanproduction.org/ "Clean Production Action | Clean Production Action designs and delivers solutions…"]. ''cleanproduction.org''. Retrieved 2017-11-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Southern China, the Pearl River delta has a high level of toxic accumulation because the area has heavy production facilities which provide 30% of China’s exports. The rivers serves as source of water supply to 47 million people yet still continues to be a dumping site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/china/en/press/reports/pearl-river-delta-2009.pdf "Greenpeace USA"] (PDF). ''www.greenpeace.org''. Retrieved 2017-11-21.&lt;/ref&gt; TURA’s guideline are being used in China to account for the toxic waste in the river and to come up with solution to reduce it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Thorpe, Beverley (2017). "How the Toxics Use Reduction Act Continues to Promote Clean Production Internationally". ''Journal of Cleaner Production''. '''19''': 552–558 – via EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a study conducted in Thailand, it was concluded that implementing a tax policy can greatly reduce toxicity emissions. The main concern is to ensure that the lower and middle-class families don’t get affected by these policies, thus  progressive toxic emission strategy should be enforced where taxation depends on much toxicity an individual or a family produces.&lt;ref&gt;Grovermann, Christian (2017). "Smart' Policies to Reduce Pesticide Use and Avoid Income Trade-Offs: An Agent-Based Model Applied to Thai Agriculture". ''Ecological Economics''. '''132''': 91–103 – via EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; n Argentina’s Rio Chuela area, there are around 4100 factories. The toxic emissions are so high that the river is turning black. After a lawsuit from the Citizen’s Action, the court directed factories to reduce the toxic emissions by 50% over five years. To achieve this goal, TURA’s guidelines have been effective in helping the Argentinian government build a framework  for its industrial sector.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Institutional Initiatives ==

There has been a push to focus on the upstream production process to reduce toxins. The idea is to regulate emissions in the early phase of the production process rather than controlling pollution results once the toxins are released into the environment. Governments, private companies and local communities are being brought together to find ways to reduce pollution output rather than pollution control.&lt;ref&gt;Brian, Mayer (2002). "Moving Further Upstream: From Toxics Reduction to the Precautionary Principle". ''Public Health Reports''. no. 6: 574 – via EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, private companies such as PaperWorks Packaging Group from Ontario, Canada have taken initiative to reduce toxic elements in the production process. The company was using toxic materials in the cleaning solutions which would escape into the atmosphere. The company decided to eliminate the Stoddard solvent from its production process to produce high quality products that are environmentally responsible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paperworksindustries.com/resources/en/paperworks-toxic-reduction-plan-stoddard-solvent.pdf "Toxics Reduction Plan Stoddard Solvent CAS: 8052-41-3"] (PDF). December 2013. Retrieved November 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there has been hesitation to wholeheartedly follow these toxics use reduction programs from a business standpoint.  While some businesses found that by switching to a different chemical instead of the toxic ones, some other companies have not changed their production processes or invested in ways to reduce toxic chemical usage because they are unsure if they will make a large enough profit.  Some businesses claim that it is too costly to run a business using alternative chemicals.  Other reasons why businesses have not necessarily switched over to a different alternative chemical in lieu of the toxic one could be a lack of knowledge that an alternative exists or the fact that the alternative may not have been created yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?v=2.1&amp;u=ucberkeley&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CCX1918701502&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1|title = Gale - Enter Product Login|website = go.galegroup.com|access-date = 2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uterine atony''' is a loss of tone in the [[uterus|uterine]] musculature.  Normally, contraction of the uterine muscles during labor compresses the blood vessels and reduces flow, thereby increasing the likelihood of coagulation and preventing hemorrhage. A lack of uterine [[muscle]] contraction, however, can lead to an acute [[hemorrhage]], as the uterine blood vessels are not sufficiently compressed. Clinically, 75-80% of [[postpartum]] hemorrhages are due to uterine atony.

==Risk factors==
Many factors can contribute to the loss of uterine muscle tone, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors= Breathnach F, Geary M|title= Uterine atony: definition, prevention, nonsurgical management, and uterine tamponade. Semin Perinatol 2009;33(2):82-7.|pmid=19324236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* overdistention of the uterus
* multiple [[gestation]]s
* [[polyhydramnios]]
* fetal [[macrosomia]]
* prolonged [[Childbirth|labor]]
* [[oxytocin]] augmentation of labor
* grand [[multiparity]] (having given birth 5 or more times)
* precipitous labor (labor lasting less than 3 hours)
* [[magnesium sulfate]] treatment of [[preeclampsia]]
* [[chorioamnionitis]]
* [[halogen]]ated [[anesthetic]]s
* [[uterine leiomyomata]]
* full bladder
* retained colyledon, placental fragments
* placenta previa
* placental abruption
* constriction ring
* incomplete separation of the placenta

==Treatment==
The first step in management of uterine atony is [[uterine massage]]. The next step is pharmacological therapies, the first of which is [[oxytocin]], used because it initiates rhythmic contractions of the uterus, compressing the spiral arteries which should reduce bleeding. The next step in the pharmacological management is the use of [[methylergonovine|methylergometrine]], which is an ergot derivative, much like that use in the abortive treatment of migraines. Its side effect of hypertension means it should not be used in those with hypertension or pre-eclampsia. In those with hypertension, the use of prostaglandin F&lt;sub&gt;2α&lt;/sub&gt; is indicated (but beware of its use in patients with asthma).
Another option Carbetocin and Carboprost where Oxytocin and ergometrin is inappropriate.

'''Drinking water and sanitation in Nicaragua''' are provided by a national public utility in urban areas and water committees in rural areas. Despite relatively high levels of investment, access to drinking water in urban areas has barely kept up with population growth, access to urban sanitation has actually declined and service quality remains poor. However, a substantial increase in access to water supply and sanitation has been reached in rural areas.

The water sector underwent major reforms in 1998 that separated policy, regulatory, and operating functions. Decentralization has been proposed for a decade, but implementation was very slow and in mid-2007 was reversed when the national water company took over two municipal systems.

''Source'': [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]] [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] &lt;ref name=JMP&gt;[http://www.wssinfo.org/  Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP)], Access Estimates for 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to water supply and sanitation in urban areas of Nicaragua has been declining, since there has been little expansion in access while population levels have increased. Even though the JMP found coverage levels to be at 85% in 2010, the '''Nicaraguan Water and Sewerage Enterprise (ENACAL)''', the public utility responsible for provision of water and sanitation services to urban areas, estimates that effective coverage is less than 60 percent due to insufficient and unreliable service. There have been significant improvements in rural areas, however, since 1990. Access to improved water supply in rural areas has increased significantly from 54% in 1990 to 68% in 2010.&lt;ref name=JMP/&gt;

Access to improved sanitation in rural areas has increased from 43% in 1990 to 52% in 2010.&lt;ref name=JMP/&gt; According to the 2005 census, access to improved water supply in Nicaragua was 77% in 2005, which is lower than the JMP estimate of 83%. Access to improved sanitation was 85% according to the 2005 census which is higher than the JMP estimate of 50%.&lt;ref name=JMP/&gt; The difference can be largely explained by the fact that the JMP definition takes into account only improved latrines with a complete structure that are in service, while the census also counts abandoned or traditional latrines.

== Service quality ==
Water supply in 47% of localities monitored by the regulatory agency (46 out of 96 systems) is not continuous.&lt;ref&gt;Water and Sanitation Program, p. 10 [http://www.wsp.org/filez/pubs/214200755130_WSP_Memoria_Taller_SWAp_version_final_.pdf WSP]&lt;/ref&gt; This share is higher in the dry season, between the months of February and May, than in the wet season. Poor quality and efficiency of water service are serious concerns in the Managua region. The existing water supply in Managua cannot meet current demand due to high rates of leakage and wastage, which account for 55% of total water produced and distributed by the system.&lt;ref&gt;“Plan de Desarrollo de Sistemas de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado Sanitario de la Ciudad de Managua 2008-2015.” ENACAL, Dirección de Planificación, Managua, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Interruptions in service provision are common, with some households receiving service for less than 2 hours per day. Only 42 percent of connections in Managua have meters operating in good condition. Additionally, ENACAL, the national utility responsible for water provision in Managua, has been labelled as "one of the most notorious overbillers in the country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://vianica.com/go/specials/20-doing-business-in-nicaragua.html  Doing Business in Nicaragua]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacteriological urban drinking water quality was considered acceptable by the [[WHO]] based on samples analyzed by the national utility.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;

In 2005 CONAPAS estimated that 42% of all collected wastewater in the country was treated.&lt;ref name="IDB"/&gt; At that moment there was no wastewater treatment system in the city of Managua.  The 2005 Census reported that 63% of households have toilet systems which discharge into sewers in Managua, with 30% of the population using pit latrines in settlements, and the remainder using septic tanks managed by five private companies.&lt;ref&gt;“The Study on Improvement of Water Supply System in Managua in the Republic of Nicaragua.” Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Empresa Nicaraguense de Acuductos y Alcantarillados Sanitarios (ENACAL), Nihon Suido Consultants Co., Ltd., Asia Air Survey Co., Ltd., March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 a Sanitation Master Plan for the City of Managua was completed and later finalized in 2002. Based on this study, ENACAL is currently overseeing the construction of a water treatment plant and collection system, funded by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the German Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW), and the Nordic Fund, which was completed by December, 2008. This new plant treats 67% of the sewage waters in Managua.&lt;ref&gt;"Plan de Desarrollo de Sistemas de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado Sanitario de la Ciudad de Managua 2008-2015." ENACAL, Direccion de Planificacion, Managua, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Water sources and uses ==

Nicaragua is a water-rich country with a water availability of 35,000 cubic meter/capita/year, corresponding to more than five times the average for Central America and the Caribbean. Less than 1% of these water resources is withdrawn for human use. The major water user is agriculture (84% of withdrawals), followed by domestic use (14%) and industry (2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/project/earthtrends/ World Resources Institute: EarthTrends Country Profile-Nicaragua]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainfall, while abundant, varies greatly. The Caribbean lowlands are the wettest section of Central America, receiving between 2,500 and 6,500 millimeters of rain annually. The western slopes of the central highlands and the Pacific lowlands receive considerably less annual rainfall. Mean annual precipitation for the rift valley and western slopes of the highlands ranges from 1,000 to 1,500 millimeters. Rainfall is seasonal—May through October is the rainy season, and December through April is the driest period.

Groundwater is the main source for municipal water supply in Nicaragua. For example, Managua - which is located on the shores of the polluted [[Lake Managua]] - is supplied entirely by groundwater, including by groundwater that infiltrates from the craters of volcanoes - called "lagoons'" within the city. For example, Asososca lagoon, to the west, is Managua's most important source of drinking water.

== History and recent developments ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Laguna de Asososca.jpg|250px|thumb|View of Asososca Lagoon and Lake Managua]] --&gt;
Under the [[Somoza]] government until 1979 the larger urban water systems were operated by the private sector, while a Ministerial department was in charge of water systems in smaller towns.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; After the revolution a centralized public national water company, the Instituto Nicaragüense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (INAA), was created.

=== The reforms of 1998 ===

After the electoral defeat of [[Daniel Ortega]]'s first administration (1979–1990) the subsequent governments tried to [[decentralization|decentralize]] service provision without much success. In 1998, under the administration of [[Arnoldo Alemán]] (1997–2002), the sector was reformed, but not decentralized. The reform consisted in the separation of policy, regulatory and service provision functions: CONAPAS was created to set policies; ENACAL was created to provide services, taking over most of the staff and assets of INAA; and a new regulatory agency was created that inherited the name INAA.&lt;ref name="WHO 2"&gt;[http://www.cepis.ops-oms.org/eswww/eva2000/nicaragua/informe/inf-02.htm  World Health Organization 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither before the 1998 reform nor afterwards was there much change in the sector towards [[decentralization]] or the establishment of [[public-private partnerships]]. The financial self-sufficiency of ENACAL improved between 1998 and 2001, but there were public protests against the hardship imposed by higher tariffs.&lt;ref name="PC"&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/ Public Citizen-Water for All, Not for Sale. Search term:CMEP Nicaragua]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, tariffs were frozen during the administration of [[Enrique Bolaños]] (2002–2007), leading to a gradual deterioration of the utility's financial situation.

=== Service contract ===

In 1999, ENACAL, with financial support from the [[Inter-American Development Bank|IDB]], accepted an international management contract with the goal of restructuring the sector to include private sector participation and transforming ENACAL into a publicly traded company. This project included provisions for decentralization, with private and local water management in the municipalities of [[León, Nicaragua|León]] and [[Chinandega]]. Protests against privatization put a halt to these reforms and in 2003 the Nicaraguan Legislature passed Law 440 which included a moratorium on any water privatization "until a national water law has been approved".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/global/latin-america/nicaragua/fighting-privatization-in-nicaragua-%E2%80%93-from-the-nicaragua-network-april-2004/ Food&amp;Water Watch: Fighting Privatization In Nicaragua- April 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the Nicaraguan Legislature also changed ENACAL’s status from a “state-owned business” to a “state-owned public utility”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iadb.org/en/projects/project,1303.html?id=NI-L1017/ “Nicaragua Water Supply and Sanitation Investment Program Loan Proposal” Inter-American Development Bank, Report No. NI-L1017, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current administration ===

The current administration of [[Daniel Ortega]] took office in November 2006. This administration does oppose private sector participation and has been critical of autonomous regulation. One option considered by the government is to establish a National Water Authority.

The current administration has supported a restructuring of the 1999 IDB project. In December 2006 ENACAL signed a five-year service contract which eliminates all private sector development, including the private contracts for the sector in Léon and Chinandega, and gives ENACAL an exclusive service contract for commercial services (meter reading, billing, customer service), supported by the IDB as part of the modernization of ENACAL.&lt;ref name="IDB"&gt;Interamerican Development Bank 2005 [http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=857010 IDB]&lt;/ref&gt; The contract has been criticized by a consumer advocacy group which argues the agreement will make access to public water more costly to most Nicaraguans.&lt;ref name="PC"&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/cmep/Water/cmep_Water/reports/nicaragua/articles.cfm?ID=13174  Public Citizen]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sector strategy ===

In October 2005 CONAPAS approved a sector strategy that aims - again - at decentralization, financial self-sufficiency and strengthening of the regulator. In addition, it calls for the development of a sustainable operational model for rural areas.

In January 2007 CONAPAS launched a 10-year comprehensive water and sanitation plan. It foresees investments of US$592m and will focus on rural areas using the Social Fund FISE as an implementing agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irc.nl/page/32219  International Reference Center (IRC) 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

A new Water Law was passed in November 2007 which gives ENACAL responsibility for supervision and control of service provision in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legislacion.asamblea.gob.ni/ GoN-Normas Jurídicas de Nicaragua]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the law's implication for institutional responsibilities is not yet clear, a strategy for the entire sector is under preparation by ENACAL—rather than CONAPAS—and should shed some light on the institutional roles in the sector.

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==
[[File:Nicaragua-map.png|thumb|450px|A map of Nicaragua.]]
The responsibilities in the water and sanitation sector in Nicaragua are defined in

* the General Drinking Water and Sewerage Services Law, Law No. 297 of 1998
* the Law-Decree No. 276 of 1998 that created ENACAL, and
* Law No. 275 of 1998 that transformed INAA into a regulatory agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inaa.gob.ni/ Instituto Nicaragüense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados -(INAA) website, section "Antecendentes"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A General Water Law (Ley General de Aguas Nacionales), which is focused on water resources but also covers a number of water supply and sanitation issues as well, was approved by Parliament on September 9, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agualatina.net/ Agualatina] Accessed on September 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy and regulation ===

Responsibility for policy setting in the Nicaraguan water and sanitation sector is vested in the National Council for Drinking Water and Sanitation - Comisión Nacional de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado Sanitario ('''CONAPAS'''). CONAPAS includes the Secretariat of the Presidency, whose representative presides the Council, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Environment, the national utility ENACAL, the regulatory agency INAA, the Institute for Territorial Studies (INETER) and the Social Investment Fund FISE.

The regulatory agency, the National Water and Sewerage Institute - Instituto Nicaragüense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, '''INAA''' - is in charge of sector regulation. It handles customer complaints, approves tariff increases and can provide concessions for service providers. However, there were no tariff increase requests between August 2002 and February 2008 and no requests for concessions, so that the regulator has been condemned to inactivity.

=== Service provision ===

According to municipal law, municipalities are responsible for providing water and sanitation services in Nicaragua. However, in practice very few municipalities actually provide these services. Instead more than 60% of water users are served by the national water and sewerage company Empresa Nicaragüense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados ('''ENACAL'''), which serves most urban areas. A further 30% are served by community organizations (potable water committees) in rural areas. Less than 10% of users are served by a departmental water company in [[Río Blanco, Matagalpa|Rio Blanco]] as well as by 26 small municipalities.&lt;ref name="IDB 1"&gt;Interamerican Development Bank, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004 ENACAL had a total of 410,000 registered users in the country, of which Managua represents 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;"The Study on Improvement of Water Supply System in Managua in the Republic of Nicaragua.” Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Empresa Nicaraguense de Acuductos y Alcantarillados Sanitarios (ENACAL), Nihon Suido Consultants Co., Ltd., Asia Air Survey Co., Ltd., March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; ENACAL has 18 regional departments. Some of these departments have received greater autonomy, such as in the case of [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]], under what is called the "Modelo de Gestion Descontentrado".

=== Other functions ===

The Social Investment Fund [http://www.fise.gob.ni/  FISE] finances infrastructure and supports local communities in the management of infrastructure. In the water and sanitation sector it has been particularly active in rural water supply and sanitation.

Besides providing services in urban areas ENACAL also supported community organizations in rural areas and has been quite successful in this field. Both the [[WHO]] and the US-financed Environmental Health Project report high levels of sustainability of rural water service provision in projects supported by ENACAL's rural water directorate.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;World Health Organization 2000 [http://www.cepis.ops-oms.org/eswww/eva2000/nicaragua/informe/inf-05.htm] and Environmental Health Project 2000 [http://www.ehproject.org/PDF/Strategic_Papers/LACDEC/Nicaragua.pdf EHP]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2005, the responsibility for support to rural communities was given to FISE and donor funds are now channeled through it.&lt;ref name="IDB 2"&gt;Interamerican Development Bank, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic efficiency ==

The efficiency of urban service provision is low, with estimated [[non-revenue water]] of more than 55% in Managua. ENACAL has taken recent steps to improve efficiency, however and labor productivity has increased from 7.5 employees per 1000 water connections in 2006 to 7.04 in 2007. In 2007 operating and administrative costs decreased by 10%. ENACAL has accomplished these improvements by cutting back on energy usage, increasing billed revenue to 11.6% as of April 2008 through improving their commercial database, expanding metering, and identifying customers who were not previously billed.&lt;ref&gt;“Plan de Desarrollo 2008-2012.” ENACAL, Nicaragua, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these improvements, ENACAL currently has a debt of 436 million córdobas (US$24 million) which is continuously growing as their expenses exceed their earnings by C$31.8 million (US$1.7 million) per month.&lt;ref&gt;ABC sobre el Recurso Agua y su Situación en Nicaragua, ENACAL, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial aspects ==

=== Tariffs and cost recovery ===
Only 59% of operating costs of ENACAL were recovered through tariff revenues as of 2012. There are many illegal connections that are not billed and many billed customers do not pay their water bills. For the utility, electricity costs for pumping are a major cost item. The government subsidizes operating costs at the tune of about 35 million Euro per year, out of operating costs equivalent to 85 million Euro (2.57 billion Cordoba).

Urban water and sewer tariffs charged by ENACAL have last been increased in 2008. There used to be substantial increases between 1998 and 2001, with annual increases of 28, 27 and 12% in 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; Such high and sustained increases were unusual in the region. While these increases allowed the public utility to regain its financial health,  in 2001 they led to protests and legal action against a proposed further 30% tariff increase.&lt;ref name="PC"/&gt;

Afterwards tariffs have been frozen, eroding again the financial health of the utility. This led to its near bankruptcy and required the National Government to make transfers of an average of US$20 million per year to compensate net losses as of 2005. In February 2008 a water tariff increase was approved to cover the rise in inflation between 2002 and 2006.  This increase is to be applied gradually beginning in May 2008, with an average increase of about 16%.  Future increases will be approved by INAA.

ENACAL tariffs are complex and ostensibly aim at protecting the poor. Tariffs vary depending on the city (although prices are lower in Managua than in the rest of the country most likely because the cost of delivery is also lower&lt;ref&gt;“Does Increasing Access to Infrastructure Services Improve the Targeting Performance of Water Subsidies?” Angel-Urdinola, Diego F., and Quentin Wodon, World Bank, Washington D.C., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;), user category (three residential user categories and "institutions", the latter paying the highest tariffs; within the residential user categories the ratio between lowest and highest tariffs is 1:3) and consumption (higher tariffs for consumption above 20, 30 and 50 cubic meters per month respectively). The poorest who have no access to water and sewerage or are served by rural water committees are by definition excluded from these subsidies.

It has been estimated that an average household in the two lowest income quintiles in the interior of the country that receives water services from ENACAL paid the equivalent of US$6.50 per month in 2003, which corresponds to about 7% of its income estimated at US$93 per month.&lt;ref&gt;Asociación de Reguladores de Agua y Saneamiento de América Latina (ADERASA): Las tarifas de agua potable y alcantarillado en América Latina, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; While this share is very high, the bill is probably lower than the economic cost of time spent carrying the water and the burden of disease from unsafe water.

In July 2007 there was a modification in sewerage tariffs for the City of Managua which allows sewage treatment costs to be partially covered. This change will be applied as soon as the sewage treatment plant becomes operational, which is expected to occur by the end of 2008.

=== Investment and financing ===
[[Image:Investment per capita in WSS in Nicaragua 1991-2006.png|thumb|450px|Nicaraguan investment per capita in water supply and sanitation from 1991 to 2006 in constant US Dollars of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/country/nicaragua/ World Bank World Development Indicators database: "Unidad Pública de Inversiones"-Data on population and deflators]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The government plans to invest 2 billion USD in the water and sanitation sector between 2013 and 2030 as part of its program VIDA - Programa Integral Sectorial de Agua y Saneamiento Humano de Nicaragua, which was elaborated as a draft in 2012. The first phase includes about USD 350 million for 2013 to 2017, or about USD 70 million per year. This would constitute a significant increase compared to previous years.

According to the Nicaraguan ''Unidad Pública de Inversiones'' or Public Investment Unit, investments in water and sanitation from 1991-2006 were US$351 million or on average USD 22 million per year. This corresponds to 0.49% of GDP or US$4.5/capita/year. Within that period investment levels increased substantially in 1997. After ranging between US$0.7 and US$1.1 per capita from 1991 to 1996, it went up to US$4.7 to US$9.4 from 1997 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;All figures in constant US Dollars of 2006&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, the average investment level per capita and year from 1997 to 2003 is higher than in its neighboring countries [[Water supply and sanitation in Costa Rica#Investment and financing|Costa Rica]] and [[Water supply and sanitation in Honduras#Investment|Honduras]], but lower than in South American countries like Argentina, [[Water supply and sanitation in Peru#Investments and financing|Peru]] and [[Water supply and sanitation in Colombia#Investment|Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;''See: [[Water supply and sanitation in Latin America and the Caribbean#Investment|Investment in water supply and sanitation in Latin America]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Investments are almost entirely financed by foreign donors and the government passes foreign credits on as grants to ENACAL and to water committees in rural areas. Between 2002 and 2007 ENACAL invested US$162 million in the sector, of which 2% was self-financed by the utility, 5% was financed by the national government with its own resources, and the remaining 93% came from external grants and loans.&lt;ref&gt;“Memoria de Gestión 2007.” ENACAL, Edición Especial, ENACAL, Departamento de Comunicación, Nicaragua, Nov-Dic 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no data on investments by [[NGO]]s, which provide funds mainly for infrastructure in rural areas.

== External support ==
The main donors in the water and sanitation sector in Nicaragua are the Spanish development cooperation (AECID) which supports the sector program VIDA,  the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) that implements the Spanish Water Fund FECASALC, the World Bank with its program to reduce water losses in Managua (PRASMA), a rural program called PRASNICA, a project for adaptation to climate change, Germany through GIZ and [[KfW]], as well as the Swiss Development Cooperation ([[COSUDE]]) in rural areas. The [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA), the Nordic Fund, the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]] and other donors also support the sector.

Numerous NGOs are engaged in the water and sanitation sector in Nicaragua, including [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]], [[Save the Children]], [[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan International]], Health without Limits, [[Water for Life]], [[Living Water International]], [[blueEnergy]] and Christian Medical Action.

=== Donor coordination ===
The various donors that support the Nicaraguan government in its efforts to improve water supply and sanitation coordinate in a sector table and have subscribed in 2005 to a Sector-Wide Approach (SwAp) to even better coordinate their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/library/ "Memoria del Taller Reducción... (2005)" Water and Sanitation Program (WSP)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sector table is not very active and the VIDA program of Spain and the IDB is now a main vehicle for the dialogue with the government on sector policies.

=== Interamerican Development Bank ===
The IDB supports many projects in the sector, in both urban and rural areas:
*[http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=NI-L1008&amp;Language=English The Municipal Social Investment Program] is a US$50 million multi-sector project approved in 2005 and implemented by FISE. KfW provides an additional US$10 million and the OPEC International Fund US$4 million of co-financing for the project.
*[http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=NI-L1017&amp;Language=English The Potable Water and Sanitation Investment Program] is a US$30.6 million project, with a potential for co-financing from SECO/Swiss for US$9 million, and was approved in 2006. The project supports Loan 1049/SF and aims to improve the technical, operational, commercial and financial management of ENACAL.The project is expected to be completed in 2011.
*[http://www.iadb.org/projects/project.cfm?language=English&amp;project=NI0097 The Modernization of the Management of Water and Sewerage Services Program] was originally approved in 1999 to support reforms in the sector surrounding privatization and a service contract was given to an international operator contractor. The US$13.9 million project, with a co-financing of US$5 million from OPEC, has been restructured as of 2006 and ENACAL is now the sole contractor. The project is expected to be completed in 2010.
*[http://www.iadb.org/projects/project.cfm?language=English&amp;project=NI0181 The Institutional Support to the Coordination and Strategy Secretariat] includes a US$1.38 million pre-investment study with ENACAL to design studies for potable water and sanitation projects within Managua. The studies are expected to be completed by the end of 2008.
*[http://www.iadb.org/projects/project.cfm?language=English&amp;project=NI0142 The Implementation Sanitation Measures Managua Lake] and [http://www.iadb.org/projects/project.cfm?language=English&amp;project=NI0027 the Lake and City of Managua Environment Improvement] projects bring together co-financing from the IDB (US$30 million), KfW (US$28 million), and the Nordic Fund (US$10 million), with the Government of Nicaragua contributing US$10 million, for a waste water treatment plant in the City of Managua. The project is expected to be completed by December 2008.

'''[[Water supply]] and [[sanitation]] in [[Venezuela]]''' has been extended to an increasing number of people during the 2000s, although many poor remain without access to piped water. Service quality for those with access is mixed, with water often being supplied only on an intermittent basis and most wastewater not being treated. [[Non-revenue water]] is estimated to be high at 62%, compared to the regional average of 40%. Tap water is relatively inexpensive, because of a national tariff freeze imposed in 2003 and a policy not to recover capital costs. Investments are financed primarily by the national government, with little reliance on external financing. The sector remains centralized despite a decentralization process initiated in the 1990s that has now been stalled. Within the executive, sector policies are determined by the Ministry of Environment. The national water company HIDROVEN serves about 80% of the population. The remainder is being served by five state water companies, the Corporación Venezolana de Guayana (CVG), a few municipalities and community-based organizations. Since the early 2000s the government encouraged the creation of about 7,500 ''Mesas Tecnicas del Agua'', which have both a technical function and a political mobilization function.&lt;ref name="AVN"&gt;[http://www.avn.info.ve/node/49470 Estado venezolano ha invertido $600 millones para mejorar servicio de agua potable ], Agencia Venezolana de Noticias, 22/03/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Major investment projects include the restoration of the polluted [[Valencia Lake]] and of the [[:es:Río Guaire|Guaire river basin]] in [[Caracas]] (2005–2013).&lt;ref name="aporrea.org"&gt;[http://www.aporrea.org/venezuelaexterior/n111053.html Venezuela cumplió con Metas del Milenio en saneamiento y agua potable], Agencia Bolivariana de Noticias, 19/03/08&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
In 2015, 93% of the total population of Venezuela had access to [[Improved water source|"improved" water]], or 95% of the urban population and 78% of the rural population. As for [[sanitation]], in 2015, 94% of the total population in Venezuela had access to [[Improved sanitation|"improved" sanitation]], or 97% of the urban population and 70% of the rural population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washwatch.org/en/countries/venezuela/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      Venezuela|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;WHO/UNICEF (2015) [https://www.wssinfo.org/documents/ Progress on sanitation and drinking water - 2015 update and MDG assessment], Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier years, access to water supply and sanitation had reached 93% in 2008, meaning that Venezuela achieved the UN Millennimum Development Goals for water and sanitation ahead of time.&lt;ref name="aporrea.org" /&gt; The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program's estimates from 2008 are based on the 2001 census results and show that 93% of citizens had access to [[drinking water|potable water]] and 91% had access to sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.wssinfo.org/en/ JMP]/2008).&lt;/ref&gt; 

A study for the [[Corporación Andina de Fomento]] (CAF), however, estimates based on figures from the 2001 census and HIDROVEN statistics that only 82% of the population had access to an improved source of water in 2001. The same source also quotes a lower coverage figure for sanitation than the WHO (only 66%). According to the same study over 4.2&amp;nbsp;million people had no access to piped water and 8&amp;nbsp;million residents did not have access to adequate sanitary facilities in 2001. 

Rural consumers are particularly under-serviced – only 66% receive potable water and 40% have access to adequate sanitation. In the period 1990-2001 the share of population with access to water supply and sanitation modestly increased from 81% to 82% for water, and 63% to 66% for sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;CAF 2004, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service quality==
In 2001, the Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas (INE) conducted a study of the quality of water and sanitation services in the country's 335 municipalities and determined that 231 municipalities, approximately 70%, received insufficient water and sanitation services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ine.gov.ve/ INE]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 about 33% of collected [[Sewage treatment|wastewater]] was treated,&lt;ref name="PRAC"/&gt; up from about 14% in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;CAF 2004, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Water supply is not uniformly continuous and often fails to meet basic drinking water quality standards. As a result, many consumers are forced to use alternative and more expensive water sources. For example, it is common in the urban ‘barrios’ in central Venezuela for poor consumers to pay the equivalent of approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]1.90&amp;nbsp;m³ – much more than the tariff for water from the network – for water purchased from a tanker.

== Water use ==
There are no reliable figures on water use in Venezuela given the low coverage of metering. According to one estimate, average residential water use was about 230&amp;nbsp;liter/capita/day in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;CAF 2004, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; According to another estimate it was twice as much at 450&amp;nbsp;liter/capita/day in 2010. In parts of Caracas water use is more than 900&amp;nbsp;liter/capital/day.&lt;ref name="PRAC"/&gt; This compares to 143&amp;nbsp;l/c/d in Brazil and 259&amp;nbsp;l/c/d in Peru.

==History and recent developments==

Before 1991 a national state-owned enterprise, the Instituto Nacional de Obras Sanitarias (INOS), was in charge of providing water and sanitation services in Venezuela.

===First phase of decentralization (1991-2001)===
When INOS was dissolved under the Presidency of [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] the intent was to decentralize service provision to the municipalities that already had the legal responsibility for service provision. However, because of the lack of capacity and resources of most municipalities, service provision in 20 out of the 23 states was temporarily entrusted to the ten regional water companies under the holding company HIDROVEN (see above). In the remaining three states services were provided by the [[Corporación Venezolana de Guayana]] (CVG).The [[Carlos Andrés Pérez|Pérez]] government also launched a bid for a private concession for the water and sanitation system of [[Caracas]] in 1992. However, the bid failed for lack of interested bidders under the proposed conditions.

Beginning in 1993 some states began to play a more active role in the sector. Until 1999 five decentralized water companies were created with a strong presence of the state governments (see above under service provision). This process began in [[Monagas]] in 1993 with support from the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis of the case of Monagas see [http://rru.worldbank.org/Documents/PublicPolicyJournal/166marin.pdf Mariño et al.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them also signed management contracts with private operators, which led to an improvement in the performance of the water and sanitation companies.

Between 1994 and 2001 water tariffs throughout the country were increased substantially, so that the ratio of cost recovery to operating costs increased from 27% to 87%.&lt;ref name="CAF 2004, p. 18"&gt;CAF 2004, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Such a substantial real tariff increase, which apparently did not cause political turmoil, is unusual in developing countries. However, the increase in tariffs was not paralleled by improvement in services. According to the IDB sector performance even deteriorated in this period.&lt;ref name="IDB 1998"&gt;IDB: [http://www.iadb.org/en/projects/project,1303.html?id=VE0111 VE0111 : Support Potable Water Decentralization], 1998, Loan Proposal, p.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The decentralization process remained very slow. Some municipalities refused to receive the service responsibility unless systems would be modernized, but a mechanism to finance the necessary investments was lacking. About 80% of the population thus continued to be served by HIDROVEN and its subsidiaries, and the slowness of the decentralization process consolidated institutions that were meant to be only temporary.&lt;ref&gt;CAF 2004, p.3 and p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===New sector law and second phase of decentralization (since 2001) ===
In December 2001 the Government of [[Hugo Chávez]] passed a new Water and Sanitation Law (Ley Orgánica para la Prestación de los Servicios de Agua Potable y Saneamiento).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensoria.gov.ve/detalle.asp?sec=150408&amp;id=312&amp;plantilla=1 Ley Organica]&lt;/ref&gt; This law was not passed by Parliament. Instead, together with 45 other laws it was passed by the Executive based on an Enabling Act that temporarily gave the President powers to enact laws and bypass Parliament.

The law aimed at reforming the institutional structure of the sector through:

* the actual transfer of the responsibility for service provision to the municipalities through the creation of decentralized service providers - Business Units or Unidades de Gestión (UGs) – each of which would serve several municipalities;
* the creation of a regulatory agency (Superintendencia Nacional de los Servicios de Agua Potable y de Saneamiento - SUNSAPS), to oversee the implementation of the Law, regulate tariffs and subsidies, and develop a monitoring system for the sector;
* the establishment of a policy making and financing body for the sector (Oficina Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Servicios de Agua Potable y Saneamiento, ONDESAPS), whose primary responsibilities would be the management of a funding mechanism for targeted sector investments, policy formulation and facilitation of the provision of technical assistance to decentralized service providers including guidance on the establishment of decentralized service providers;
* the creation of a national bulk water company to operate and expand regional water infrastructure; and
* the establishment of a sector financing fund to channel public resources to the sector under a consistent policy framework.

According to the law HIDROVEN had to complete the transfer within no more than five years from the publication of the law, i.e. until December 2006. However, the transfer has been very slow and the deadline has not been met. Only in a few regions the decentralization to municipalities has advanced, notably in the State of [[Guárico]] where HIDROPAEZ, one of the regional utilities under the umbrella of HIDROVEN, is in the process of being replaced by five business units. The Government has also completed studies on the formation of business units in the states of [[Cojedes (state)|Cojedes]], [[Carabobo]] and [[Aragua (state)|Aragua]].
Furthermore, the national institutions foreseen by the law so far have not been created. The Ministry of Environment and HIDROVEN thus continue to undertake the national-level functions that the 2001 law had assigned to the new institutions.

In February 2003 tariffs were frozen at the national level through an executive decree. This is in direct contradiction with the 2001 law that stipulates the principle of cost recovery and assigns the responsibility to set tariffs to the municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;CAF 2004, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility for water supply and sanitation==

===Policy and regulation===
The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources is in charge of setting water and sanitation policies in Venezuela, in line with overall government policies. There is a Vice-ministry of Water within the Ministry and as of August 2007 the Vice-Minister was Cristóbal Francisco Ortiz. HIDROVEN is under the authority of this Ministry. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce sets maximum allowable tariffs in the sector.

===Service provision===
[[Image:Venezuela politica copy.png|right|500px]]

Water and sanitation services in Venezuela are provided by the national water company HIDROVEN, five state water companies, the Corporación Venezolana de Guayana (CVG), a few municipalities and community-based organizations.

According to the Municipal Law (Ley Orgánica de Régimen Municipal) service provision is a responsibility of the country's 335 municipalities, which own the water and sanitation infrastructure and in principle also set water and sanitation tariffs. However, in practice only few municipalities have the capacity and resources to fulfill these responsibilities.

==== HIDROVEN ====

In practice service provision in most urban areas of Venezuela is the responsibility of one of ten regional [[public utility|utilities]] ([http://www.hidroven.gov.ve/HIDROLOGICAS.htm  Empresas Hidrologicas Regionales]) affiliated with the Compañía Anónima Hidrológica de Venezuela (HIDROVEN), a state-owned enterprise. Each regional utility covers between one and three of the country’s 23 [[States of Venezuela|states]].&lt;ref&gt;The geographical coverage or the 10 regional utilities does ''not'' correspond to the country's nine [[Regions of Venezuela|regions]].&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibility for setting tariffs within the maximum levels set by the national government is shared between the regional companies and the municipalities.

Some of the bulk water supply infrastructure which provides water to municipal and state water companies is owned directly by HIDROVEN and its affiliated regional companies.

==== Corporación Venezolana de Guayana ====

In the region of [[Guayana Region|Guayana]], covering the states of [[Bolivar (state)|Bolivar]], [[Amazonas (Venezuelan state)|Amazonas]] and [[Delta Amacuro]], water and sanitation services in urban areas are provided by the [[Corporación Venezolana de Guayana]] (CVG), a conglomerate with its main activities in mining.

==== State water companies ====

There are also five decentralized water companies at the state level:

* Aguas de [[Monagas]],
* [http://www.hidrolara.com.ve/index.asp HIDROLARA] in [[Lara (state)|Lara]],
* Aguas de [[Mérida state|Mérida]],
* Aguas de [[Portuguesa (state)|Portuguesa]], and
* Aguas de [[Yaracuy]].

The population of these five states is almost 20% of the country's total population.

==== Municipalities ====

In some municipalities services are provided through municipal utilities, such as in Aguas de [[Anaco]] in [[Anzoátegui]] state, Aguas de Capitanejo and Aguas de Zamora in [[Barinas (state)|Barinas]] state, Aguas de Ejido in [[Mérida state]], and [[Sucre]] in [[Miranda (state)|Miranda]] state.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

==== Community-based organizations ====

Rural water systems are managed by community-based organization, including some cooperatives. In 2003 there were also 20 urban cooperatives that provided water services at the neighborhood level. The Chávez government encourages such "community experiences", which also include so-called "technical water tables" (Mesas Técnicas de Agua). These are associations involved in monitoring neighborhood-level segments of water supply and sanitation networks, including the identification and reduction of leakage and illegal connections. In 2003 there were about 1,500 such technical water tables in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eraecologica.org/revista_04/era_ecologica_4.htm?dossier.htm~mainFrame La Era Ecológica: Hidroven marca la senda del agua que nos une, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic efficiency==
[[Non-revenue water]] stood at 62% in 2000, far above the regional average of 40% and higher than its historical level of 55% in 1996 and 59% in 1997.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;[http://www.bvsde.paho.org/eswww/eva2000/venezuela/informe.html World Health Organization, Evaluation of water and sanitation in the Americas, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;  HIDROVEN suggests illegal connections are a major contributor to poor non-revenue water performance in the country. An inadequate record maintenance and rehabilitation likely also contributes to high losses.

==Financial aspects==

===Tariffs and cost recovery===
'''Cost recovery'''. Revenues usually are not sufficient to meet operating costs - the ratio of revenue to operating costs was estimated at 86% in 2002. This was a substantial increase compared to 27% in 1994, 65% in 1997 and 75% in 2000, despite high levels of inflation.&lt;ref name="CAF 2004, p. 18" /&gt; As of 2010, 36% of all users, mainly in groups with low ability to pay, received water free of charge.&lt;ref name="PRAC"/&gt; In 2010 Hidrocapital, which serves Caracas, charged on average the equivalent of US$0.41 per cubic meter, while its costs were US$0.44 per cubic meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Inter-American Development Bank|title=WATER CONSUMPTION EFFICIENCY PROGRAM (PRAC)  (VE-L1027)|url=http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=35073918|accessdate=18 September 2011|pages=Annex II, 5|date=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2008, Hidroven had a sales revenue of MB$786, thus covering 77% of its operation and maintenance costs of MB$1,024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Inter-American Development Bank|title=WATER CONSUMPTION EFFICIENCY PROGRAM (PRAC)  (VE-L1027)|url=http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=35073918|accessdate=18 September 2011|pages=8|date=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''Tariff level and adjustments'''. Tariff levels vary substantially within Venezuela by a factor of almost 1:10 between regional companies, reflecting differences in the cost of service provision. The highest tariffs are found in [[Caracas]] and the lowest in Aguas de [[Yaracuy]] and [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]].&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; Tariffs were frozen in February 2003 at the national level, leading to a 60% tariff decline in [[real versus nominal value|real value]] because of inflation until 2010.&lt;ref name="PRAC"/&gt;

'''Metering, billing and collection'''. In 2008 the share of metered water consumption in total water consumption was 36%, up from only 20% in 1998. However, only about half the meters were read in 2008 with a meter reading rate of only 17.5%.&lt;ref name="PRAC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Inter-American Development Bank|title=WATER CONSUMPTION EFFICIENCY PROGRAM (PRAC)  (VE-L1027)|url=http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=35073918|accessdate=18 September 2011|pages=1–3|date=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billing and collection performance is inadequate as total sector collection in 2003 amounted for merely 73% of the total billing. In 1998 this coefficient stood at only 62%.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; In individual companies the ratio varied greatly between 26% in [[Yaracuy]] and 80% in [[Mérida (state)|Mérida]].

===Investment===
'''Historical investment levels''' There are no recent data on the level of investments in the sector. In the five years between 1997 and 2001 Venezuela invested US$ 637&amp;nbsp;million in water and sanitation, or about US$ 127&amp;nbsp;million annually on average. Investment in the sector has historically been volatile. For example, annual investments fluctuated in the 1986-1998 period between less than US$100&amp;nbsp;million (in 1989) and US$400&amp;nbsp;million (in 1992).&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; To a large extent investment levels mirror fluctuation in oil prices. Investment levels declined from 1986-1989 when oil prices were very low. Investments skyrocketed in 1992 after oil prices had increased. Then they plummeted again when oil prices decreased during the remainder of the 1990s. The volatility in sector financing has made it difficult to initiate a sustainable medium-term investment program needed to rehabilitate infrastructure and extend access to services.

'''Planned investment levels''' In 2002 the Government adopted an ambitious six-year investment plan for the sector. Under that Plan by the end of 2007 access to potable water and sanitation should both reach 99%, non-revenue water should be reduced to 45%, collection efficiency should increase to 95% and the share of treated wastewater should reach 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hidroven.gov.ve/plan%20sexenal/plan%20sexenal.htm HIDROVEN]&lt;/ref&gt; The plan estimates that a total of US$ 4.77&amp;nbsp;billion will be required between 2003-2015 for the sector, which implies an average ''annual'' investment of approximately US$ 500&amp;nbsp;million, or about four times historic investment levels.

=== Financing ===
'''Sources of financing''' Before the decentralization of the 1990s investments were almost exclusively financed by central government transfers through a number of different programs, including funds borrowed from international financial institutions and passed on as grants to the service providers. In 2000-2001 state governments and municipalities financed almost half of total investments of US$120m and US$190m respectively.&lt;ref&gt;HIDROVEN data quoted in CAF 2004, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The capital market makes no contribution to sector financing.

'''Procedures for Investment Financing''' The 2001 sector law calls for the creation of a Financial Assistance Fund (Fondo de Asistencia Financiera - FAF) to be administered by a new entity called ONDESAPS which would coordinate and target investments in the sector (see section on the new sector law above). Until 2007 neither FAF nor ONDESAPS have been created. Neither investment subsidies nor recurrent subsidies, whether paid by the national government or state governments, are linked to performance improvements.

==External support==
The Inter-American Development Bank and the Andean Development Corporation are the main institutions that provide external support for water supply and sanitation in Venezuela. It was reported in 2004 that the lack in the availability of counterpart funds, which the government has to provide as part of their obligations to execute projects financed by external agencies, had paralyzed various large externally financed projects.&lt;ref&gt;CAF 2004, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interamerican Development Bank''' In 2010 the [[Inter-American Development Bank|IDB]] provided a $50 million loan to promote the efficient use of drinking water by replacing pipes and installing meters for 80,000 households in at least five of the subsidiaries of Hidroven, including in the Ocumarito neighborhood in Caracas.&lt;ref name="PRAC"/&gt; Previously the IDB had attempted to support the reform of the water and sanitation sector through a decentralization loan of US$100&amp;nbsp;million that was approved in 1998 and had to be cancelled subsequently.&lt;ref name="IDB 1998"/&gt; The loan had aimed at introducing private sector participation, following the model of management contracts in the state of [[Monagas]] and [[Lara (state)|Lara]].

'''Andean Development Corporation''' The Andean Development Corporation ([[Corporación Andina de Fomento]], CAF supported the water and sanitation sector through various loans, including five loans approved until 2003 for a total of US$292m, of which three for HIDROCAPITAL, the subsidiary of HIDROVEN serving Caracas. In 2004 CAF approved a US$15m loan to improve water and sanitation services in the Peninsula of La Guajira in [[Zulia]] state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caf.com/attach/11/default/operaciones-venezuela04.pdf  CAF 2004 operations report for Venezuela]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the CAF reassigned US$25m from a non-disbursing water and sanitation sector modernization and rehabilitation loan to environmental projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caf.com/attach/11/default/OperacionesporpaísVenezuela2005.pdf  CAF 2005 operations report for Venezuela]&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 2008, the CAF announced that it has approved a water and sanitation loan for the Venezuelan states of [[Amazonas (Venezuelan state)|Amazonas]], [[Anzoátegui]], [[Aragua (state)|Aragua]], [[Bolívar (state)|Bolívar]], [[Cojedes (state)|Cojedes]], [[Delta Amacuro]], [[Sucre (state)|Sucre]] and [[Trujillo (state)|Trujillo]]. The program is estimated to have a total cost of US$72.3m, of which CAF will finance US$50m, the remainder being financed by local counterpart funds. The program will be executed by Hidroven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2008/01/09/eco_ava_caf-aprueba-prestamo_09A1292479.shtml CAF aprueba préstamo por 50 millones de dólares para obras en Venezuela],

==Etymology ==
[[File:Shiva Bangalore .jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Shiva]] in [[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]], [[India]], performing yogic meditation in the [[Lotus position|Padmasana]] posture.]]

The [[Sanskrit]] noun ''{{IAST|yoga}}'' is cognate with English "[[yoke]]". It is derived from the 
root ''{{IAST|[[:wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yewg-|yuj]]}}'' "to attach, join, harness, yoke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Swami Satyananda Saraswati |authorlink=Swami Satyananda Saraswati |title=Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha  |publisher=Yoga Publications Trust |location=Munger, Bihar, India |year=1996 |isbn=978-81-86336-14-4 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spiritual sense of the word ''[[Yoga (philosophy)|yoga]]'' first arises in [[Epic Sanskrit]], in the second half of the 1st millennium BCE, and is associated with the philosophical system presented in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]],
with the chief aim of "uniting" the human spirit with the  [[īśvara|Divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"application or concentration of the thoughts, abstract contemplation, meditation , (esp.) self-concentration, abstract meditation and mental abstraction practised as a system (as taught by Patañjali and called the yoga philosophy; it is the second of the two sāṃkhya systems,  its chief aim being to teach the means by which the human spirit may attain complete union with īśvara or the Supreme Spirit; in the practice of self-concentration it is closely connected with Buddhism". Monier-Williams, ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'' (1899)&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''[[kriyā]]yoga'' has a technical meaning in the ''Yoga Sutras'' (2.1), designating the "practical" aspects of the philosophy, i.e. the "union with the supreme" due to performance of duties in everyday life&lt;ref&gt;Whicher, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pāṇini]],  the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots, ''yujir yoga'' (to yoke) or ''yuj samādhau'' ("to concentrate").&lt;ref name="Dasgupta 1975 226" /&gt; In the context of the ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'', the root ''yuj samādhau'' (to concentrate) is considered by traditional commentators as the correct etymology.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant 2009, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with Pāṇini, [[Vyasa]] who wrote the first commentary on the ''Yoga Sutras'',&lt;ref&gt;Bryant 2009, p. xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; states that yoga means ''[[Samadhi|samādhi]]'' (concentration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aranya |first=Swami Hariharananda |authorlink=Swami Hariharananda Aranya |title=Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali with Bhasvati |year=2000 |publisher=[[University of Calcutta]]|location=Calcutta, India |isbn=81-87594-00-4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dasgupta, the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots, ''yujir yoga'' ("to yoke") or ''yuj samādhau'' ("to concentrate").&lt;ref name="Dasgupta 1975 226"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dasgupta |first=Surendranath |title=A History of Indian Philosophy | volume =1 |year=1975 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |location=[[Delhi]], India |isbn=81-208-0412-0 |page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone who practices yoga or follows the yoga philosophy with a high level of commitment is called a [[yogi]] (may be applied to a man or a woman) or [[yogini]] (a woman).&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary: "Yogi, One who practices yoga." Websters: "Yogi, A follower of the yoga philosophy; an ascetic."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition in classic Indian texts==
The term yoga has been defined in various ways in the many different Indian philosophical and religious traditions.

== Goals ==
The ultimate goal of Yoga is ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation), although the exact definition of what form this takes depends on the philosophical or theological system with which it is conjugated.

According to Jacobsen, Yoga has five principal meanings:&lt;ref name="Jacobsen4" /&gt;
# a disciplined method for attaining a goal;
# techniques of controlling the body and the mind;
# a name of a school or system of philosophy (''{{IAST|darśana}}'');
# with prefixes such as "hatha-, mantra-, and laya-, traditions specialising in particular techniques of yoga;
# the goal of Yoga practice.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen4"&gt;Jacobsen, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Gordon White, from the 5th century CE onward, the core principles of "yoga" were more or less in place, and variations of these principles developed in various forms over time:{{sfn|White|2011|p=6}}

# a meditative means of discovering dysfunctional perception and cognition, as well as overcoming it for release from suffering, inner peace and salvation; illustration of this principle is found in Hindu texts such as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' and ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yogasutras]]'', in a number of Buddhist Mahāyāna works, as well as Jain texts;{{sfn|White|2011|pp=6–8}}
# the raising and expansion of consciousness from oneself to being coextensive with everyone and everything; these are discussed in sources such as in Hinduism Vedic literature and its Epic ''[[Mahābhārata]]'', Jainism Praśamaratiprakarana, and Buddhist Nikaya texts;{{sfn|White|2011|pp=8–9}}
# a path to omniscience and enlightened consciousness enabling one to comprehend the impermanent (illusive, delusive) and permanent (true, transcendent) reality; examples are found in Hinduism [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisesika]] school texts as well as Buddhism Mādhyamaka texts, but in different ways;{{sfn|White|2011|pp=9–10}}
# a technique for entering into other bodies, generating multiple bodies, and the attainment of other supernatural accomplishments; these are, states White, described in [[Tantra|Tantric]] literature of Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as the Buddhist Sāmaññaphalasutta;{{sfn|White|2011|pp=10–12}} James Mallinson, however, disagrees and suggests that such fringe practices are far removed from the mainstream Yoga's goal as meditation-driven means to liberation in Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mallinson | first=James | title=The Yogīs' Latest Trick | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP) | volume=24 | issue=1 | year=2013 | pages=165–180 | doi=10.1017/s1356186313000734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

White clarifies that the last principle relates to legendary goals of "yogi practice", different from practical goals of "yoga practice," as they are viewed in South Asian thought and practice since the beginning of the Common Era, in the various Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain philosophical schools.{{sfn|White|2011|p=11}}

== Schools ==
Yoga is practised with a variety of methods, including by Jains and Buddhists. In Hinduism, practices include [[Jnana yoga|Jnana Yoga]], [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti Yoga]], [[Karma yoga|Karma Yoga]], [[Laya yoga|Laya Yoga]] and [[Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga]].

Raja yoga originally denoted the ultimate goal of yoga, ''samadhi'',{{sfn|Mallinson|2011|p=770}} but was popularised by Vivekananda as the common name for Ashtanga Yoga, the eight limbs to be practised to attain [[samadhi]], as described in the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]''.{{sfn|Hari Dass|1978}}{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}}

=== Hinduism ===

==== Classical yoga ====
{{main|Yoga (philosophy)}}
Yoga is considered as a philosophical school in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], Indian Philosophy, London, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1971, Volume II, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga, in this context, is one of the six ''[[Āstika and nāstika|āstika]]'' schools of Hinduism (those which accept the Vedas as source of knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=82, 224–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DTPJpanTizwC&amp;pg=PA446&amp;dq=yoga+is+one+of+the+six+astika+schools+of+hindu+philosophy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Changing World Religions, Cults &amp; Occult |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the influence of Vivekananda, the ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'' have since the 20th century been considered the foundational scripture of classical yoga.{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}} Before then, other works such as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' and the ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'' were considered the most central,{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}} while Tantric Yoga and Hatha Yoga prevailed over Ashtanga Yoga.{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}}

==== Ashtanga yoga ====
{{Main|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Rāja yoga}}
[[File:Swami Vivekananda 1896.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Swami Vivekananda]] equated raja yoga with the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.&lt;ref name=vivekarajayoga&gt;Swami Vivekananda, Raja Yoga, {{ISBN|978-1500746940}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Yoga as described in the ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'' refers to Ashtanga yoga.{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}} The ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'' is considered as a central text of the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Whicher, pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt; It is often called "Rāja yoga", "yoga of the kings," a term which originally referred to the ultimate, royal goal of yoga, which is usually ''samadhi'',{{sfn|Mallinson|2011|p=770}} but was popularised by Vivekananda as the common name for Ashtanga Yoga.{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}}

Ashtanga yoga incorporates epistemology, metaphysics, ethical practices, systematic exercises and self-development techniques for body, mind and spirit.&lt;ref name=edbryant /&gt; Its [[epistemology]] (''[[pramana]]s'') is same as the [[Samkhya]] school. Both accept three reliable means to knowledge – perception (''pratyākṣa'', direct sensory observations), inference (''anumāna'') and testimony of trustworthy experts (''sabda'', agama). Both these orthodox schools are also strongly [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]].

Many scholars also include the ''Goraksha Samhita'' by [[Gorakshanath]] of the 11th century in the above list.&lt;ref name=kriyananda /&gt; Gorakshanath is widely considered to have been responsible for popularizing hatha yoga as we know it today.&lt;ref name=dwhite&gt;On page 140, David Gordon White says of Gorakshanath: "... hatha yoga, in which field he was India's major systematizer and innovator."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bajpai&gt;Bajpai writes on page 524: "Nobody can dispute about the top ranking position of Sage Gorakshanath in the philosophy of Yoga."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;Eliade writes of Gorakshanath on page 303: "...he accomplished a new synthesis among certain Shaivist traditions (Pashupata), tantrism, and the doctrines (unfortunately, so imperfectly known) of the siddhas&amp;nbsp;– that is, of the perfect yogis."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'Bodhisattva Manjusri and Prajnaparamita', Nepal, c. 1575, Norton Simon Museum.JPG|thumb|180px|16th century Buddhist artwork in Yoga posture.]]
Buddhist meditation encompasses a variety of [[meditation]] techniques that aim to develop [[Sati (Buddhism)|mindfulness]], [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|concentration]], [[Abhijñā|supramundane powers]], [[samatha|tranquility]], and [[vipassanā|insight]].

Core techniques have been preserved in ancient [[Buddhist texts]] and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] pursue meditation as part of the path toward [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] and [[Nirvana]].{{refn|group=note|For instance, Kamalashila (2003), p. 4, states that Buddhist meditation "includes any method of meditation that has [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] as its ''ultimate'' aim." Likewise, Bodhi (1999) writes: "To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation.... At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye … shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, [[Nirvana|Nibbana]]...."  A similar although in some ways slightly broader definition is provided by Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 142: "'''Meditation''' – general term for a multitude of religious practices, often quite different in method, but all having the same goal: to bring the consciousness of the practitioner to a state in which he can come to an experience of 'awakening,' 'liberation,' 'enlightenment.'"  Kamalashila (2003) further allows that some Buddhist meditations are "of a more preparatory nature" (p. 4).}} The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are ''[[Bhavana|bhāvanā]]''{{refn|group=note|The [[Pāli]] and [[Sanskrit]] word ''bhāvanā'' literally means "development" as in "mental development." For the association of this term with "meditation," see Epstein (1995), p. 105; and, Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 20.  As an example from a well-known discourse of the [[Pali Canon]], in "The Greater Exhortation to Rahula" (''Maha-Rahulovada Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 62), Ven. [[Sariputta]] tells Ven. [[Rahula]] (in Pali, based on [http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0202m.mul1.xml VRI, n.d.)]: ''{{IAST|ānāpānassatiṃ, rāhula, bhāvanaṃ bhāvehi.}}''  [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html Thanissaro (2006)] translates this as: "Rahula, develop the meditation [''{{IAST|bhāvana}}''] of [[anapanasati|mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing]]." (Square-bracketed Pali word included based on Thanissaro, 2006, end note.)}} and ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhāna/dhyāna]]''.{{refn|group=note|See, for example, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:2005.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), entry for "jhāna&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;"]; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/onetool.html Thanissaro (1997)]; as well as, Kapleau (1989), p.&amp;nbsp;385, for the derivation of the word "zen" from [[Sanskrit]] "dhyāna." [[Pali Text Society|PTS]] Secretary Dr. Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of [[sramana|wandering ascetics]] contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:
:"...[T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as 'altered states of consciousness'. In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed 'meditations' ([Skt.:] ''dhyāna'' / [Pali:] ''jhāna'') or 'concentrations'  (''[[samādhi]]''); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world." (Gethin, 1998, p. 10.)}}

=== Jainism ===
{{Main|Jain meditation}}
Jain meditation has been the central practice of spirituality in [[Jainism]] along with the [[Ratnatraya|Three Jewels]].&lt;ref name="Ratna traya"&gt;{{cite book|first= Acharya |last=Mahapragya |title=Jain Yog |publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh |chapter=Foreword |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meditation in Jainism aims at realizing the self, attain salvation, take the soul to complete freedom.&lt;ref name="blessings"&gt;{{cite book |first=Acharya |last=Tulsi |title=Sambodhi |publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh |url=http://www.adarshsahityasangh.com/BookDetail.aspx?Id=24 |oclc=39811791 |chapter=blessings |year=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305051429/http://www.adarshsahityasangh.com/bookdetail.aspx?id=24 |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to reach and to remain in the pure state of soul which is believed to be pure conscious, beyond any attachment or aversion. The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (''Gyata-Drashta'').  Jain meditation can be broadly categorized to the auspicious ''Dharmya Dhyana'' and ''Shukla Dhyana'' and inauspicious ''Artta'' and ''Raudra'' Dhyana.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Tantra ===
{{Main|Tantra|Yogi|Siddhi}}
Samuel states that [[Tantrism]] is a contested concept.{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=9}} Tantra yoga may be described, according to Samuel, as practices in 9th to 10th century Buddhist and Hindu (Saiva, Shakti) texts, which included yogic practices with elaborate deity visualizations using geometrical arrays and drawings ([[mandala]]), fierce male and particularly female deities, transgressive life stage related rituals, extensive use of [[chakra]]s and [[mantra]]s, and sexual techniques, all aimed to help one's health, long life and liberation.{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=9}}&lt;ref&gt;Mukunda Stiles, Tantra Yoga Secrets, Weiser, {{ISBN|978-1-57863-503-0}}, pages 3–7&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origins of yoga are a matter of debate.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=87–90}} There is no consensus on its chronology or specific origin other than that yoga developed in ancient India. Suggested origins are the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (3300–1900 BCE){{sfn|Crangle|1994|p=4–7}} and pre-Vedic [[East India|Eastern states of India]],{{sfn|Zimmer|1951|p=217, 314}} the [[Vedic period]] (1500–500 BCE), and the [[śramaṇa]] movement.{{sfn|Samuel|2008}} According to Gavin Flood, continuities may exist between those various traditions:
{{quote|[T]his dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=77}}{{refn|group=note|Gavin Flood: "These renouncer traditions offered a new vision of the human condition which became incorporated, to some degree, into the worldview of the Brahman householder. The ideology of asceticism and renunciation seems, at first, discontinuous with the brahmanical ideology of the affirmation of social obligations and the performance of public and domestic rituals. Indeed, there has been some debate as to whether asceticism and its ideas of retributive action, reincarnation and spiritual liberation, might not have originated outside the orthodox vedic sphere, or even outside Aryan culture: that a divergent historical origin might account for the apparent contradiction within 'Hinduism' between the world affirmation of the householder and the world negation of the renouncer. However, this dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal. Indeed there are continuities between vedic Brahmanism and Buddhism, and it has been argued that the Buddha sought to return to the ideals of a vedic society which he saw as being eroded in his own day."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=76–77}}}}}}

Pre-philosophical speculations of yoga begin to emerge in the texts of {{circa|500|200&amp;nbsp;BCE}}. Between 200&amp;nbsp;BCE and 500&amp;nbsp;CE, philosophical schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of yoga began to emerge.&lt;ref name="Larson, p. 36"&gt;Larson, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga. Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy.

=== Pre-Vedic India ===
{{Main|Indus Valley Civilization}}
Yoga may have pre-Vedic elements.{{sfn|Crangle|1994|p=4–7}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1951|p=217, 314}} Some state yoga originated in the Indus Valley Civilization.{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=2–3}} Marshall,&lt;ref name="Possehl 2003, pp. 144–145"&gt;Possehl (2003), pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade&lt;ref name=marksing /&gt; and other scholars suggest that the [[Pashupati seal]] discovered in Indus Valley Civilization sites depict figures in positions resembling a common yoga or meditation pose. This interpretation is considered speculative and uncertain by more recent analysis of Srinivasan&lt;ref name=marksing /&gt; and may be a case of projecting "later practices into archeological findings".{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=2–10}}

According to Crangle, some researchers have favoured a linear theory, which attempts "to interpret the origin and early development of Indian contemplative practices as a sequential growth from an Aryan genesis",{{sfn|Crangle|1994|p=4}}{{refn|group=note|See also Gavin Flood (1996), ''Hinduism'', p.87–90, on "The orthogenetic theory" and "Non-Vedic origins of renunciation".{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=87–90}}}} just like traditional Hinduism regards the Vedas to be the ultimate source of all spiritual knowledge.{{sfn|Crangle|1994|p=5}}{{refn|group=note|Post-classical traditions consider [[Hiranyagarbha]] as the originator of yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Feuerstein |first= Georg |title= The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice |year= 2001 |publisher=  Hohm Press|location= Arizona, USA |isbn= 978-1-890772-18-5 |page= Kindle Locations 7299–7300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Aranya |first= Swami Hariharananda |authorlink= Swami Hariharananda Aranya |title= Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali with Bhasvati |year= 2000 |publisher= University of Calcutta |location= Calcutta, India |isbn= 81-87594-00-4|page=xxiv | chapter = Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thomas McEvilley favors a composite model where pre-Aryan yoga prototype existed in the pre-Vedic period and its refinement began in the Vedic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McEvilley|first=Thomas|year=1981|title=An Archaeology of Yoga|url= http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/RESv1n1ms20166655  |journal= Anthropology and aesthetics|volume=1 (spring)|page=51|doi=10.1086/RESv1n1ms20166655|issn=0277-1322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zimmer, Yoga philosophy is reckoned to be part of the non-Vedic system, which also includes the [[Samkhya]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]], Jainism and Buddhism:{{sfn|Zimmer|1951|p=217, 314}} "[Jainism] does not derive from Brahman-Aryan sources, but reflects the cosmology and anthropology of a much older pre-Aryan upper class of northeastern India [Bihar] – being rooted in the same subsoil of archaic metaphysical speculation as Yoga, Sankhya, and Buddhism, the other non-Vedic Indian systems."{{sfn|Zimmer|1951|p=217}}{{refn|group=note|Zimmer's point of view is supported by other scholars, such as Niniam Smart, in ''Doctrine and argument in Indian Philosophy'', 1964, p.27–32 &amp; p.76,{{sfn|Crangle|1994|p=7}} and S.K.

==== Vedic ascetic practices ====
Ascetic practices (''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]''), concentration and bodily postures used by Vedic priests to conduct [[yajna]] (sacrifice), might have been precursors to yoga.{{refn|group=note|
* Jacobsen writes that "Bodily postures are closely related to the tradition of tapas, ascetic practices in the Vedic tradition. The use by Vedic priests of ascetic practices in their preparations for the performance of the sacrifice might be precursor to Yoga."&lt;ref name="Jacobsen6"&gt;Jacobsen, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whicher believes that "the proto-Yoga of the Vedic rishis is an early form of sacrificial mysticism and contains many elements characteristic of later Yoga that include: concentration, meditative observation, ascetic forms of practice (tapas), breath control..."&lt;ref name="Whicher, p. 12" /&gt;}} ''Vratya'', a group of ascetics mentioned in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', emphasized on bodily postures which may have evolved into yogic [[asana]]s.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen6" /&gt; Early [[Samhita]]s also contain references to other group ascetics such as munis, the [[keśin]], and vratyas.&lt;ref name="Flood94"&gt;Flood, p. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques for controlling breath and vital energies are mentioned in the [[Brahmana]]s (texts of the Vedic corpus, c. 1000–800 BCE) and the ''Atharvaveda''.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whicher, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nasadiya Sukta]] of the ''Rig Veda'' suggests the presence of an early contemplative tradition.{{refn|group=note|* Wynne states that "The Nasadiyasukta, one of the earliest and most important cosmogonic tracts in the early Brahminic literature, contains evidence suggesting it was closely related to a tradition of early Brahminic contemplation. A close reading of this text suggests that it was closely related to a tradition of early Brahminic contemplation. The poem may have been composed by contemplatives, but even if not, an argument can be made that it marks the beginning of the contemplative/meditative trend in Indian thought."&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Miller suggests that the composition of Nasadiya Sukta and ''[[Purusha Sukta]]'' arises from "the subtlest meditative stage, called absorption in mind and heart" which "involves enheightened experiences" through which seer "explores the mysterious psychic and cosmic forces...".&lt;ref name="Whicher11"&gt;Whicher, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known appearance of the word "yoga", with the same meaning as the modern term, is in the [[Katha Upanishad]],&lt;ref name=marksing /&gt;{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=95}} probably composed between the fifth and third century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Phillips|title=Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uLqrAgAAQBAJ |year=2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14485-8|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olivelle1998p12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle|title=The Early Upanishads: Annotated Text and Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4IRDAAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-512435-4 |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is defined as the steady control of the senses, which along with cessation of mental activity, leading to a supreme state.&lt;ref name="Flood94" /&gt;{{refn|For the date of this Upanishad see also Helmuth von Glasenapp, from the 1950 Proceedings of the "Akademie der Wissenschaften und Literatur"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/vonglasenapp/wheel002.html |title=Vedanta and Buddhism, A Comparative Study |accessdate=29 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204142029/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/vonglasenapp/wheel002.html |archivedate=4 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} ''Katha Upanishad'' integrates the monism of early Upanishads with concepts of samkhya and yoga. It defines various levels of existence according to their proximity to the innermost being ''Ātman''. Yoga is therefore seen as a process of interiorization or ascent of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Whicher, p. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobsen8"&gt;Jacobsen, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the earliest literary work that highlights the fundamentals of yoga. White states:
{{quote|The earliest extant systematic account of yoga and a bridge from the earlier Vedic uses of the term is found in the Hindu Katha Upanisad (Ku), a scripture dating from about the third century BCE[…] [I]t describes the hierarchy of mind-body constituents—the senses, mind, intellect, etc.—that comprise the foundational categories of Sāmkhya philosophy, whose metaphysical system grounds the yoga of the Yogasutras, Bhagavad Gita, and other texts and schools (Ku3.10–11; 6.7–8).{{sfn|White|2011|p=4}}}}

The hymns in Book 2 of the ''[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]]'', another late first millennium BCE text, states a procedure in which the body is held in upright posture, the breath is restrained and mind is meditatively focussed, preferably inside a cave or a place that is simple, plain, of silence or gently flowing water, with no noises nor harsh winds.&lt;ref&gt;See: Original Sanskrit: [http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_pdf/shveta.pdf Shvetashvatara Upanishad] Book 2, Hymns 8–14;&lt;br /&gt; English Translation: [[Paul Deussen]] (German: 1897; English Translated by Bedekar &amp; Palsule, Reprint: 2010), Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 309–310&lt;br /&gt; Secondary Source Review: Mark Singleton (2010), Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-539534-1}}, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobsen8" /&gt;

The ''[[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]]'', likely composed in a later century than ''Katha'' and ''Shvetashvatara Upanishads'' but before Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, mentions sixfold yoga method – breath control (''pranayama''), introspective withdrawal of senses (''pratyahara''), meditation (''dhyana''), mind concentration (''dharana''), philosophical inquiry/creative reasoning (''tarka''), and absorption/intense spiritual union (''samadhi'').&lt;ref name=marksing /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobsen8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Introducing Yoga's Great Literary Heritage | last=Feuerstein|first= Georg | journal=[[Yoga Journal]] |date=January–February 1988 | issue=78|authorlink=Georg Feuerstein|pages=70–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Yoga discussion in above [[Principal Upanishads]], twenty [[Yoga Upanishads]] as well as related texts such as [[Yoga Vasistha]], composed in 1st and 2nd millennium CE, discuss Yoga methods.&lt;ref&gt;TRS Ayyangar (1938), [https://archive.org/stream/TheYogaUpanishads/TheYogaUpanisadsSanskritEngish1938#page/n3/mode/2up The Yoga Upanishads] The Adyar Library, Madras&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon White (2011), Yoga in Practice, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691140865}}, pages 97–112&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sutras of Hindu philosophies ====
Yoga is discussed in the ancient foundational [[Sutra]]s of [[Hindu philosophy]]. The ''[[Vaiśeṣika Sūtra]]'' of the [[Vaisheshika]] school of Hinduism, dated to have been composed sometime between 6th and 2nd century BCE discusses Yoga.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|pp=56-59}}{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|pp=98-99}}{{refn|group=note|The currently existing version of ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'' manuscript was likely finalized sometime between 2nd century BCE and the start of the common era.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=54}} Wezler has proposed that the Yoga related text may have been inserted into this Sutra later, among other things; however, Bronkhorst finds much to disagree on with Wezler.&lt;ref name= Bronkhorst64/&gt;}} According to [[Johannes Bronkhorst]], an Indologist known for his studies on early Buddhism and Hinduism and a professor at the University of Lausanne, ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'' describes Yoga as "a state where the mind resides only in the soul and therefore not in the senses".&lt;ref name= Bronkhorst64/&gt; This is equivalent to ''pratyahara'' or withdrawal of the senses, and the ancient Sutra asserts that this leads to an absence of ''sukha'' (happiness) and ''dukkha'' (suffering), then describes additional yogic meditation steps in the journey towards the state of spiritual liberation.&lt;ref name= Bronkhorst64&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst|title=The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AZbZDP8MRJoC&amp;pg=PA64|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1114-0|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, ''[[Brahma sutras]]'' – the foundational text of the [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, discusses yoga in its ''sutra'' 2.1.3, 2.1.223 and others.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009p281"/&gt; ''Brahma sutras'' are estimated to have been complete in the surviving form sometime between 450 BCE to 200 CE,&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p26"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J.

==== Macedonian historical texts ====
[[Alexander the Great]] reached India in the 4th century BCE. Along with his army, he took Greek academics with him who later wrote memoirs about geography, people and customs they saw. One of Alexander's companion was [[Onesicritus]], quoted in Book 15, Sections 63–65 by [[Strabo]], who describes yogins of India.&lt;ref name=charlesrl&gt;Charles R Lanman, [https://archive.org/stream/jstor-1507563/1507563#page/n3/mode/2up The Hindu Yoga System], Harvard Theological Review, Volume XI, Number 4, Harvard University Press, pages 355–359&lt;/ref&gt; Onesicritus claims those Indian yogins (''Mandanis '') practiced aloofness and "different postures – standing or sitting or lying naked – and motionless".&lt;ref name=strabo&gt;Strabo, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#ref101 Geography] Book XV, Chapter 1, see '''Sections 63–65''', Loeb Classical Library edition, Harvard University Press, Translator: HL Jones, Archived by: University of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;

Onesicritus also mentions his colleague ''Calanus'' trying to meet them, who is initially denied audience, but later invited because he was sent by a "king curious of wisdom and philosophy".&lt;ref name=strabo /&gt; Onesicritus and Calanus learn that the yogins consider the best doctrine of life as "rid the spirit of not only pain, but also pleasure", that "man trains the body for toil in order that his opinions may be strengthened", that "there is no shame in life on frugal fare", and that "the best place to inhabit is one with scantiest equipment or outfit".&lt;ref name=charlesrl /&gt;&lt;ref name=strabo /&gt; These principles are significant to the history of spiritual side of yoga.&lt;ref name=charlesrl /&gt; These may reflect the ancient roots of "undisturbed calmness" and "mindfulness through balance" in later works of Hindu [[Patanjali]] and Buddhist [[Buddhaghosa]] respectively, states [[Charles Rockwell Lanman]];&lt;ref name=charlesrl /&gt; as well as the principle of ''[[Aparigraha]]'' (non-possessiveness, non-craving, simple living) and [[sannyasa|asceticism]] discussed in later Hinduism and Jainism.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==== Early Buddhist texts ====
Werner states, "The Buddha was the founder of his [Yoga] system, even though, admittedly, he made use of some of the experiences he had previously gained under various Yoga teachers of his time."&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner (1998), Yoga and the Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816091}}, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; He notes:&lt;ref name="Werner (1977) p. 119–20" /&gt;

{{quote|But it is only with Buddhism itself as expounded in the [[Pali Canon]] that we can speak about a systematic and comprehensive or even integral school of Yoga practice, which is thus the first and oldest to have been preserved for us in its entirety.&lt;ref name="Werner (1977) p. 119–20"&gt;Werner (1977) p. 119–20&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The chronology of completion of these yoga-related Pali Canons, however, is unclear, just like ancient Hindu texts.{{sfn|Samuel|2008|pp=31–32}}&lt;ref&gt;Mark Singleton (2010), Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-539534-1}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Early known Buddhist sources like the ''Majjhima Nikāya'' mention meditation, while the ''Anguttara Nikāya'' describes ''Jhāyins'' (meditators) that resemble early Hindu descriptions of ''Muni'', ''Kesins'' and meditating ascetics,&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannes Bronkhorst|Bronkhorst, Johannes]] (1993), The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816435}}, pages 1–24&lt;/ref&gt; but these meditation-practices are not called yoga in these texts.{{sfn|White|2011|pp=5–6}} The earliest known specific discussion of yoga in the Buddhist literature, as understood in modern context, is from the third- to fourth-century CE scriptures of the Buddhist Yogācāra school and fourth- to fifth-century [[Visuddhimagga]] of Buddhaghosa.{{sfn|White|2011|pp=5–6}}

A yoga system that predated the Buddhist school is Jain yoga. But since Jain sources postdate Buddhist ones, it is difficult to distinguish between the nature of the early Jain school and elements derived from other schools.&lt;ref name="Werner (1977) p. 119–20" /&gt; Most of the other contemporary yoga systems alluded in the Upanishads and some Pali canons are lost to time.&lt;ref name="Eating disorders"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Douglass|first=Laura|title=Thinking Through The Body: The Conceptualization Of Yoga As Therapy For Individuals With Eating Disorders|journal=Academic Search Premier|year=2011|page=83|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&amp;sid=1d8495be-1c1c-4423-ad48-1f6054f42876%40sessionmgr111&amp;hid=103|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Datta|first=Amaresh|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: devraj to jyoti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1809|year=1988|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0|page=1809 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|On the dates of the Pali canon, Gregory Schopen writes, "We know, and have known for some time, that the Pali canon as we have it — and it is generally conceded to be our oldest source — cannot be taken back further than the last quarter of the first century BCE, the date of the Alu-vihara redaction, the earliest redaction we can have some knowledge of, and that — for a critical history — it can serve, at the very most, only as a source for the Buddhism of this period. But we also know that even this is problematic... In fact, it is not until the time of the commentaries of Buddhaghosa, Dhammapala, and others — that is to say, the fifth to sixth centuries CE — that we can know anything definite about the actual contents of [the Pali] canon."&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

The early Buddhist texts describe meditative practices and states, some of which the Buddha borrowed from the śramaṇa tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gombrich]], "Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo." Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Stoler Miller, "Yoga: Discipline of Freedom: the Yoga Sutra Attributed to Patanjali; a Translation of the Text, with Commentary, Introduction, and Glossary of Keywords." University of California Press, 1996, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate for the purposes of controlling hunger or the mind, depending on the passage.&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, James. 2007. ''The Khecarīvidyā of Adinathā.'' London: Routledge. pg.17–19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no mention of the tongue being inserted into the [[Pharynx#Nasopharynx|nasopharynx]] as in true [[khecarī mudrā]]. The Buddha used a posture where pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, similar to even modern postures used to stimulate Kundalini.&lt;ref&gt;James Mallinson, "Sāktism and Hathayoga," 6 March 2012. [http://www.khecari.com/resources/SaktismHathayoga.pdf PDF file] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616025645/http://www.khecari.com/resources/SaktismHathayoga.pdf |date=16 June 2013 }} [accessed 10 June 2012] pgs. 20–21 "The Buddha himself is said to have tried both pressing his tongue to the back of his mouth, in a manner similar to that of the hathayogic khecarīmudrā, and ukkutikappadhāna, a [[squatting posture]] which may be related to hathayogic techniques such as mahāmudrā, mahābandha, mahāvedha, mūlabandha, and vajrāsana in which pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, in order to force upwards the breath or Kundalinī."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Uncertainty with chronology ====
Alexander Wynne, author of ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation'', observes that formless meditation and elemental meditation might have originated in the Upanishadic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, pp. 44–45,58.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to meditation is in the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'', one of the oldest Upanishads.&lt;ref name="Flood94" /&gt; ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' describes the five kinds of vital energies (''[[prana]]''). Concepts used later in many yoga traditions such as internal sound and veins (''[[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]]'') are also described in the Upanishad.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen6" /&gt; ''[[Taittiriya Upanishad]]'' defines yoga as the mastery of body and senses.&lt;ref&gt;Whicher, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bhagavad Gita ====
[[File:Bhagavata Gita Bishnupur Arnab Dutta 2011.JPG|thumb|[[Krishna]] narrating the [[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]] to [[Arjuna]]]]
{{Main|Bhagavad Gita}}
The ''Bhagavad Gita'' ('Song of the Lord'), uses the term "yoga" extensively in a variety of ways. In addition to an entire chapter (ch. 6) dedicated to traditional yoga practice, including meditation,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; it introduces three prominent types of yoga:&lt;ref&gt;Flood, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Karma yoga]]: The yoga of action.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen, p. 10–11"&gt;Jacobsen, p. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bhakti yoga]]: The yoga of devotion.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen, p. 10–11" /&gt;
* [[Jnana yoga]]: The yoga of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;E. Easwaran, Essence of the Bhagavad Gita, Nilgiri Press, {{ISBN|978-1-58638-068-7}}, pages 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Hawley (2011), The Bhagavad Gita, {{ISBN|978-1-60868-014-6}}, pages 50, 130; Arvind Sharma (2000), Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-564441-8}}, pages 114–122&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gita consists of 18 chapters and 700 ''shlokas'' (verses),&lt;ref name="bibekd"/&gt; with each chapter named as a different yoga, thus delineating eighteen different yogas.&lt;ref name=bibekd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, p. 46.; Georg Feuerstein (2011), The Bhagavad Gita – A New Translation, Shambhala, {{ISBN|978-1-59030-893-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars divide the ''Gita'' into three sections, with the first six chapters with 280 ''shlokas'' dealing with Karma yoga, the middle six containing 209 shlokas with Bhakti yoga, and the last six chapters with 211 shlokas as Jnana yoga; however, this is rough because elements of ''karma'', ''bhakti'' and ''jnana'' are found in all chapters.&lt;ref name=bibekd&gt;Bibek Debroy (2005), The Bhagavad Gita, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|978-0-14-400068-5}}, Introduction, pages x–xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mahabharata ====
Description of an early form of yoga called ''nirodhayoga'' (yoga of cessation) is contained in the Mokshadharma section of the 12th chapter (''Shanti Parva'') of the ''Mahabharata''. The verses of the section are dated to c. 300–200 BCE{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}. ''Nirodhayoga'' emphasizes progressive withdrawal from the contents of empirical consciousness such as thoughts, sensations etc. until ''purusha'' (Self) is realized. Terms like ''vichara'' (subtle reflection), ''viveka'' (discrimination) and others which are similar to Patanjali's terminology are mentioned, but not described.&lt;ref&gt;Whicher, p. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no uniform goal of yoga mentioned in the ''Mahabharata''. Separation of self from matter, perceiving ''[[Brahman]]'' everywhere, entering into ''Brahman'' etc. are all described as goals of yoga. Samkhya and yoga are conflated together and some verses describe them as being identical.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen9" /&gt; Mokshadharma also describes an early practice of elemental meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahabharata defines the purpose of yoga as the experience of uniting the individual ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]'' with the universal [[Brahman]] that pervades all things.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen9"&gt;Jacobsen, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classical era (200 BCE – 500 CE) ===
This period witnessed many texts of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism discussing and systematically compiling yoga methods and practices. Of these, Patanjali's Yoga Sutras are considered as a key work.

==== Classical yoga ====
During the period between the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] and the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] eras (c. 200 BCE–500 CE) philosophical schools of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of yoga began to emerge.&lt;ref name="Larson, p. 36" /&gt;

Yoga as a philosophy is mentioned in Sanskrit texts dated to be completed between 200 BCE–200 CE. Kauṭilya's [[Arthashastra]] in verse 1.2.10, for example, states that there are three categories of ''anviksikis'' (philosophies) – [[Samkhya]] (nontheistic), Yoga (theistic) and [[Charvaka|Cārvāka]] (atheistic materialism).&lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit: साङ्ख्यं '''योगो''' लोकायतं च इत्यान्वीक्षिकी |&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: [https://archive.org/stream/Arthasastra_English_Translation/Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_-_English#page/n9/mode/2up Arthasastra Book 1, Chapter 2] Kautiliya, R Shamasastry (Translator), page 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, Patrick (2013), King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India: Kautilya's Arthasastra, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-989182-5}}, see Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Samkhya =====
{{further|Samkhya}}
&lt;!--[[File:KapilaMuni.jpg|thumb|[[Kapila]] Muni, in a Kolkata temple]]--&gt;

Many traditions in India began to adopt systematic methodology by about first century CE. Of these, [[Samkhya]] was probably one of the oldest philosophies to begin taking a systematic form.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali systematized Yoga, building them on the foundational metaphysics of Samkhya. In the early works, the Yoga principles appear together with the Samkhya ideas. Vyasa's commentary on the ''Yoga Sutras'', also called the ''Samkhyapravacanabhasya'' (''Commentary on the Exposition of the Sankhya Philosophy''), describes the relation between the two systems.&lt;ref&gt;Radhankrishnan, Indian Philosophy, London, George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., 1971 edition, Volume II, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; The two schools have some differences as well. Yoga accepted the conception of "personal god", while Samkhya developed as a rationalist, non-theistic/atheistic system of Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref name=lpfl /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga – An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-64887-5}}, pages 31–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For yoga acceptance of samkhya concepts, but with addition of a category for God, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes Patanjali's system is referred to as ''Seshvara Samkhya'' in contradistinction to Kapila's ''Nirivara Samkhya''.&lt;ref&gt;Radhankrishnan, Indian Philosophy, London, George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., 1971 edition, Volume II, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parallels between Yoga and Samkhya were so close that [[Max Müller]] says that "the two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Müller (1899), Chapter 7, "Yoga Philosophy," p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Yoga Sutras of Patanjali =====
{{Main|Raja Yoga|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
[[File:Patanjali.jpg|thumb|Traditional Hindu depiction of Patanjali as an avatar of the divine serpent [[Shesha]].]]
{{Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
In Hindu philosophy, yoga is the name of one of the six ''[[astika|orthodox]]'' (which accept the testimony of Vedas) philosophical schools.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the six orthodox schools, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, "Contents," and pp. 453–487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a brief overview of the yoga school of philosophy see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Karel Werner, author of ''Yoga And Indian Philosophy'', believes that the process of systematization of yoga which began in the middle and Yoga Upanishads culminated with the ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali''.{{refn|Werner writes, "The word Yoga appears here for the first time in its fully technical meaning, namely as a systematic training, and it already received a more or less clear formulation in some other middle Upanishads....Further process of the systematization of Yoga as a path to the ultimate mystic goal is obvious in subsequent Yoga Upanishads and the culmination of this endeavour is represented by Patanjali's codification of this path into a system of the eightfold Yoga."&lt;ref&gt;Werner, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

There are numerous parallels in the concepts in ancient Samkhya, Yoga and Abhidharma Buddhist schools of thought, particularly from 2nd century BCE to 1st century AD, notes Larson.&lt;ref name=l4345&gt;Larson, pp. 43–45&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali's Yoga Sutras is a synthesis of these three traditions. From Samkhya, Yoga Sutras adopt the "reflective discernment" (''adhyavasaya'') of ''prakrti'' and ''purusa'' (dualism), its metaphysical rationalism, as well its three [[epistemology|epistemic]] methods to gaining reliable knowledge.&lt;ref name=l4345 /&gt; From Abhidharma Buddhism's idea of ''nirodhasamadhi'', suggests Larson, Yoga Sutras adopt the pursuit of altered state of awareness, but unlike Buddhist's concept of no self nor soul, Yoga is physicalist and realist like Samkhya in believing that each individual has a self and soul.&lt;ref name=l4345 /&gt; The third concept Yoga Sutras synthesize into its philosophy is the ancient [[Sannyasa|ascetic]] traditions of meditation and introspection, as well as the yoga ideas from middle Upanishads such as Katha, Shvetashvatara and Maitri.&lt;ref name=l4345 /&gt;

Patanjali's Yoga Sutras are widely regarded as the first compilation of the formal yoga philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;For [[Patanjali]] as the founder of the philosophical system called yoga see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The verses of ''Yoga Sutras'' are terse. Many later Indian scholars studied them and published their commentaries, such as the ''Vyasa Bhashya'' (c. 350–450 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali's yoga is also referred to as Raja yoga.&lt;ref&gt;For "raja yoga" as a system for control of the mind and connection to Patanjali's ''Yoga Sutras'' as a key work, see: Flood (1996), pp. 96–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali defines the word "yoga" in his second sutra:

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;'''{{lang|sa|योगश्‍चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः}}'''&lt;br /&gt;''({{IAST|yogaś citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ}})''&lt;br /&gt;- ''Yoga Sutras'' 1.2&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms. [[I. K. Taimni]] translates it as "Yoga is the inhibition (''{{IAST|nirodhaḥ}}'') of the modifications (''{{IAST|vṛtti}}'') of the mind (''{{IAST|citta}}'')".&lt;ref&gt;For text and word-by-word translation as "Yoga is the inhibition of the modifications of the mind." See: Taimni, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Vivekananda]] translates the sutra as "Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff (''Citta'') from taking various forms (''Vrittis'')."&lt;ref&gt;Vivekanada, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]] explains that, to Patanjali, "Yoga essentially consists of meditative practices culminating in attaining a state of consciousness free from all modes of active or discursive thought, and of eventually attaining a state where consciousness is unaware of any object external to itself, that is, is only aware of its own nature as consciousness unmixed with any other object."&lt;ref name=edbryant&gt;Edwin Bryant (2011, Rutgers University), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/yoga/ The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali] IEP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant 2009, p. 10"&gt;Bryant 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant 2009, p. 457"&gt;Bryant 2009, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the meaning of yoga is understood as the practice of [[nirodha]] (mental control), then its goal is "the unqualified state of ''niruddha'' (the perfection of that process)",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Yoga Sytras of Patanjali, A Study Guide for Book I, Samadhi Pada; Translation and Commentary|last = Dass|first = Baba Hari|publisher = Sri Rama Publishing|year = 1999|isbn = 0-918100-20-8|location = Santa Cruz, Californnia|pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Baba Hari Dass]]. In that context, "yoga (union) implies duality (as in joining of two things or principles); the result of yoga is the nondual state", and "as the union of the lower self and higher Self. The nondual state is characterized by the absence of individuality; it can be described as eternal peace, pure love, Self-realization, or liberation."&lt;ref&gt;Baba Hari Dass (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali's writing also became the basis for a system referred to as "Ashtanga Yoga" ("Eight-Limbed Yoga"). This eight-limbed concept is derived from the 29th Sutra of the Book 2 of Yoga Sutras. They are:

===== Yoga and Vedanta =====

Yoga and Vedanta are the two largest surviving schools of Hindu traditions. They share many thematic principles, concepts and belief in self/soul, but diverge in degree, style and some of their methods. Epistemologically, Yoga school accepts three means to reliable knowledge, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six ways.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3067-5}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga disputes the [[monism]] of Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref name=shphillips /&gt; Yoga school believes that in the state of [[moksha]], each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as an independent identity; Advaita Vedanta, in contrast, believes that in the state of [[moksha]], each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as part of Oneness with everything, everyone and the Universal Self. They both hold that the free conscience is aloof yet transcendent, liberated and self-aware. Further, Advaita Vedanta school enjoins the use of Patanjali's yoga practices and the reading of Upanishads for those seeking the supreme good, ultimate freedom and [[Jivanmukta|jivanmukti]].&lt;ref name=shphillips&gt;{{cite book | first=Stephen H. | last=Phillips | title=Classical Indian Metaphysics: Refutations of Realism and the Emergence of "New Logic" | publisher=Open Court Publishing | year=1995 | pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jainism ====

{{Main|Jainism}}
[[File:Parsva Shatrunjay.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Tirthankara [[Parsva]] in Yogic meditation in the [[Kayotsarga]] posture.]]

According to ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]'', 2nd century CE Jain text, yoga is the sum of all the activities of mind, speech and body.&lt;ref name="Tattvarthasutra 2007 p. 102" /&gt; [[Umasvati]] calls yoga the cause of "asrava" or [[Karma in Jainism|karmic influx]]&lt;ref name="Tattvarthasutra 6.2"&gt;Tattvarthasutra [6.2]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one of the essentials—''[[Ratnatraya|samyak caritra]]''—in the path to liberation.&lt;ref name="Tattvarthasutra 6.2" /&gt; In his ''Niyamasara'', Acarya [[Kundakunda]], describes ''yoga bhakti''—devotion to the path to liberation—as the highest form of devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Niyamasara [134–40]&lt;/ref&gt; Acarya [[Haribhadra]] and Acarya [[Hemacandra]] mention the five major vows of ascetics and 12 minor vows of laity under yoga. This has led certain [[Indologist]]s like Prof. [[Robert J. Zydenbos]] to call Jainism, essentially, a system of yogic thinking that grew into a full-fledged religion.&lt;ref&gt;Zydenbos, Robert. "Jainism Today and Its Future." München: Manya Verlag, 2006. p.66&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yamas#Five yamas of Patañjali|five yamas]] or the constraints of the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' bear a resemblance to the [[Mahavrata|five major vows of Jainism]], indicating a history of strong cross-fertilization between these traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Zydenbos (2006) p.66&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Worthington writes, "Yoga fully acknowledges its debt to Jainism, and Jainism reciprocates by making the practice of yoga part and parcel of life."&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

Mainstream Hinduism's influence on Jain yoga can be see in [[Haribhadra]]'s ''[[Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya]]'' which outlines an eightfold yoga influenced by Patanjali's eightfold yoga.&lt;ref&gt;P. 313 ''The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of the Classical Yoga'' By Ian Whicher&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Yogacara school ====
{{Main|Yogacara}}
In the late phase of Indian antiquity, on the eve of the development of [[Classical Hinduism]], the
[[Yogacara]] movement arises during the [[Gupta period]] (4th to 5th centuries).
Yogacara received the name as it provided a "yoga," a framework for engaging in the practices that lead to the path of the [[bodhisattva]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus.

Alexander Simpkins, Annellen M. Simpkins. Published 2001. Tuttle Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8048-3199-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages (500–1500 CE) ===
Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga. Hatha yoga emerged in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, pp. 136–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bhakti movement ====
{{Main|Bhakti Yoga}}
The [[Bhakti movement]] was a development in medieval Hinduism which advocated the concept of a [[personal God]] (or "[[Svayam Bhagavan|Supreme Personality of Godhead]]"). The movement was initiated by the [[Alvars]] of South India in the 6th to 9th centuries, and it started gaining influence throughout India by the 12th to 15th centuries.&lt;ref name="Cutler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutler|first=Norman|title=Songs of Experience|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1987|page=1|isbn=978-0-253-35334-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veSItWingx8C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaiva and [[Vaishnava]] bhakti traditions integrated aspects of ''Yoga Sutras'', such as the practical meditative exercises, with devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' elucidates the practice of a form of yoga called ''viraha'' (separation) ''bhakti''. ''Viraha bhakti'' emphasizes one pointed concentration on Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tantra ====
Tantra is a genre of yoga that arose in India no later than the 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Einoo |first=Shingo (ed.) |year=2009 |page=45 |title=Genesis and Development of Tantrism |publisher=University of Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The earliest documented use of the word "Tantra" is in the [[Rigveda]] (X.71.9).&lt;ref name=Banerjee&gt;Banerjee, S.C., 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The context of use suggests the word ''tantra'' in Rigveda means "technique".}} George Samuel states, "Tantra" is a contested term, but may be considered as a school whose practices appeared in mostly complete form in Buddhist and Hindu texts by about 10th century CE.{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=9}}  Over its history, some ideas of Tantra school influenced the [[Hindu]], [[Bon]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], and [[Jainism|Jain]] traditions. Elements of Tantric yoga rituals were adopted by and influenced state functions in medieval Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]].{{sfn|White|2000|p=7}}{{sfn|Samuel|2008|pp=324–333}}

By the turn of the first millennium, [[hatha yoga]] emerged from [[tantra]].&lt;ref name="khecari1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated16" /&gt;

===== Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhism =====
{{Main|Vajrayana}}
[[Vajrayana]] is also known as '''Tantric Buddhism''' and ''Tantrayāna''. Its texts were compiled starting with 7th century and Tibetan translations were completed in 8th century CE. These tantra yoga texts were the main source of Buddhist knowledge that was imported into Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;John Powers (2004), in Encyclopedia of Buddhism (Editors: Damien Keown et al.), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-31414-5}}, pages 775–785&lt;/ref&gt; They were later translated into Chinese and other Asian languages, helping spread ideas of Tantric Buddhism. The Buddhist text [[Hevajra Tantra]] and ''Caryāgiti'' introduced hierarchies of chakras.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"&gt;White, David Gordon. ''Yoga in Practice''.

in Pundarīka's eleventh-century Vimalaprabhā commentary on the Kālacakratantra, hathayoga is said to bring about the "unchanging moment" (aksaraksana) "through the practice of nāda by forcefully making the breath enter the central channel and through restraining the bindu of the bodhicitta in the vajra of the lotus of wisdom". While the means employed are not specified, the ends, in particular restraining bindu, semen, and making the breath enter the central channel, are similar to those mentioned in the earliest
descriptions of the practices of hathayoga, to which I now turn."&lt;/ref&gt; Hatha yoga synthesizes elements of Patanjali's ''Yoga Sutras'' with posture and breathing exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  It marks the development of asanas (plural) into the full body 'postures' now in popular usage&lt;ref name="Burley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burley|first=Mikel|title=Hatha Yoga: Its Context, Theory and Practice|year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=978-8120817067|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ezxQHzjwUosC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mikel+burley#v=onepage&amp;q=mikel%20burley&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, along with its many modern variations, is the style that many people associate with the word ''yoga'' today.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg.

=== Reception in the West ===
{{see|Yoga as exercise}}
[[File:Ustrasana - Camel Pose.jpg|thumb|right|The Ustrasana, also known as the camel pose, is one of several yoga asana (pose).]]

Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid-19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy. In the context of this budding interest, [[N. C. Paul]] published his ''Treatise on Yoga Philosophy'' in 1851.

The first Hindu teacher to actively advocate and disseminate aspects of yoga to a western audience, [[Swami Vivekananda]], toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Shaw, Eric. "35 Moments", ''[[Yoga Journal]]'', 2010-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The reception which Swami Vivekananda received built on the active interest of intellectuals, in particular the [[Transcendental Club|New England Transcendentalists]], among them [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882), who drew on [[German Romanticism]] and the interest of philosophers and scholars like [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.

Author: Elizabeth De Michelis. Published: Continuum, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of Yoga was adopted as a cultural trend in Europe and North America starting in the first half of the 20th century. There were periods of criticism and paranoia against yoga as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the 1960s, western interest in Hindu spirituality reached its peak, giving rise to a great number of [[Hindu revivalism|Neo-Hindu]] schools specifically advocated to a western public.

Since 2001, the popularity of yoga in the USA has expanded. The number of people who practiced some form of yoga has grown from 4 million (in 2001) to 20 million (in 2011). It has drawn support from world leaders such as [[Barack Obama]] who stated, "Yoga has become a universal language of spiritual exercise in the United States, crossing many lines of religion and cultures,... Every day, millions of people practice yoga to improve their health and overall well-being.

{{Main|Yoga as exercise}}

Yoga has been studied and may be recommended to promote relaxation, reduce stress and improve some medical conditions such as [[premenstrual syndrome]].&lt;ref name=duplerfrey/&gt; Yoga is considered to be a low-impact activity that can provide the same benefits as "any well-designed exercise program, increasing general health and stamina, reducing stress, and improving those conditions brought about by sedentary lifestyles". It is particularly promoted as a [[physical therapy]] routine, and as a regimen to strengthen and balance all parts of the body.&lt;ref name=duplerfrey&gt;Dupler, Douglas; Frey, Rebecca (2006) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/yoga.aspx#1 Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine], 3rd ed, {{ISBN|978-0787618681}}; Retrieved 30 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of the medical community regards the results of yoga research as significant, others point to many flaws which undermine results.

Among the main reasons that experts cite for causing negative effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification.&lt;ref name="NTYM01512" /&gt; As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries.&lt;ref name="NTYM01512" /&gt; In turn, a beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them.&lt;ref name="NTYM01512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DM82912" /&gt;

On the contrary, one can take from them what is useful so long as the Christian conception of prayer, its logic and requirements are never obscured.

In 1989 and 2003, the [[Holy Office|Vatican]] issued two documents: ''[[Aspects of Christian meditation]]'' and "[[A Christian reflection on the New Age]]," that were mostly critical of eastern and New Age practices. The 2003 document was published as a 90-page handbook detailing the Vatican's position.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of vocational psychology'' by W. Bruce Walsh, Mark Savickas 2005 {{ISBN|0-8058-4517-8}} page 358&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican warned that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation "can degenerate into a cult of the body" and that equating bodily states with mysticism "could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations." Such has been compared to the early days of Christianity, when the church opposed the gnostics' belief that salvation came not through faith but through a mystical inner knowledge.&lt;ref name="nytimes_vatican" /&gt; The letter also says, "one can see if and how [prayer] might be enriched by meditation methods developed in other religions and cultures"&lt;ref name="Letter_from_Vatican"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfmed.htm |title=1989 Letter from Vatican to Bishops on Some Aspects of Christian Meditation |publisher=Ewtn.com |accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but maintains the idea that "there must be some fit between the nature of [other approaches to] prayer and Christian beliefs about ultimate reality."&lt;ref name="nytimes_vatican" /&gt; Some{{Which|date=January 2018}} [[Fundamental Christianity|fundamentalist]] Christian organizations consider yoga to be incompatible with their religious background, considering it a part of the [[New Age movement]] inconsistent with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Ankerberg, John &amp; Dr Weldon, John, ''Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs'', Harvest House Publishers, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view holds that Christian meditation can lead to religious pluralism. This is held by an interdenominational association of Christians that practice it. "The ritual simultaneously operates as an anchor that maintains, enhances, and promotes denominational activity and a sail that allows institutional boundaries to be crossed." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = An Anchor and a Sail: Christian Meditation as the Mechanism for a Pluralist Religious Identity | journal = Sociology of Religion | year = 2009 | first = Jonathan | last = Mermis–Cava }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these was Patanjali's Yogasutras.&lt;ref name=sptg&gt;S Pines and T Gelblum (Translators from Arabic to English, 1966), Al-Bīrūni (Translator from Sanskrit to Arabic, ~ 1035 AD), and Patañjali, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/611180 Al-Bīrūnī's Arabic Version of Patañjali's "Yogasūtra"], Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol. 29, No. 2 (1966), pages 302–325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David White (2014), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq06f The "Yoga Sutra of Patanjali" – A Biography], Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4008-5005-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Biruni's translation preserved many of the core themes of Patañjali 's Yoga philosophy, but certain sutras and analytical commentaries were restated making it more consistent with Islamic monotheistic theology.&lt;ref name=sptg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Maas (2013), A Concise Historiography of Classical Yoga Philosophy, in Periodization and Historiography of Indian Philosophy (Editor: Eli Franco), Sammlung de Nobili, Institut für Südasien-, Tibet- und Buddhismuskunde der Universität Wien, {{ISBN|978-3-900271-43-5}}, pages 53–90, {{oclc|858797956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Biruni's version of Yoga Sutras reached Persia and Arabian peninsula by about 1050 AD. Later, in the 16th century, the hath yoga text ''Amritakunda'' was translated into Arabic and then Persian.&lt;ref&gt;Satish Chandra (2007), Historiography, Religion, and State in Medieval India, {{ISBN|978-8124100356}}, pages 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga was, however, not accepted by mainstream Sunni and Shia Islam. Minority Islamic sects such as the mystic [[Sufi]] movement, particularly in South Asia, adopted Indian yoga practises, including postures and breath control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1017/S1356186304004675| title = Situating Sufism and Yoga| year = 2005| last1 = Ernst | first1 = C.

Malaysia's top [[Islam]]ic body in 2008 passed a [[fatwa]], prohibiting [[Muslim]]s from practicing yoga, saying it had elements of [[Hinduism]] and that its practice was [[Blasphemy in Islam|blasphemy]], therefore [[haraam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam.gov.my/portal/lihat.php?jakim=3600 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106003351/http://www.islam.gov.my/portal/lihat.php?jakim=3600 |archivedate=6 January 2009 |title=Sidang Media – Fatwa Yoga |publisher=Islam.gov.my|accessdate=5 September 2010|quote=Quote: The Fatwas of Religious Council in Islamic affairs on Yoga.

In Iran, as of May 2014, according to its Yoga Association, there were approximately 200 yoga centres in the country, a quarter of them in the capital [[Tehran]], where groups can often be seen practising in parks. This has been met by opposition among conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21602272-conservative-clerics-are-wary-popular-pastime-perils-yoga|title=The perils of yoga: Conservative clerics are wary of a popular pastime|work=Economist.com.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Turkey's head of the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|Directorate of Religious Affairs]], [[Ali Bardakoğlu]], discounted personal development techniques such as [[reiki]] and yoga as commercial ventures that could lead to extremism. His comments were made in the context of reiki and yoga possibly being a form of proselytization at the expense of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/domestic/11692086.asp?gid=244 |title=It's OK to stretch, just don’t believe |publisher=Hurriyet.com.tr |accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
