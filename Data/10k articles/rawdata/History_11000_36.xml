The '''three Scottish soldiers' murders''' was an incident that took place in [[Northern Ireland]] during [[the Troubles]]. It happened on 10 March 1971, when the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] shot dead three unarmed [[British Army]] soldiers of the 1st Battalion, [[Royal Highland Fusiliers]]. Two of the three were teenage brothers; all three were from Scotland. They were murdered off-duty and in civilian clothes, having been lured from a city-centre bar in [[Belfast]], driven to a remote location and shot whilst relieving themselves by the roadside. Three British soldiers had been killed prior to this event; all had been on duty and killed during rioting.

The deaths led to public mourning and protests against the Provisional IRA. Pressure to act precipitated a political crisis for the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|government of Northern Ireland]], which led to the resignation of Northern Ireland Prime Minister [[James Chichester-Clark]]. The British Army raised the minimum age needed to serve in Northern Ireland to 18 in response to this incident. In 2010 a memorial was dedicated to the three soldiers near to where they were killed in north Belfast.

==Events==
British troops had been deployed to Northern Ireland in 1969 for [[Operation Banner]] in response to a deteriorating security situation following the [[1969 Northern Ireland riots]]. The British Army had become involved in the disturbances culminating in the [[Falls Curfew]] of July 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

McCaughey's younger brother was serving in the same unit but was on duty and unable to join them. The three soldiers were off-duty, unarmed and in civilian clothes. They were drinking in "Mooney's", a [[Belfast city centre]] bar in Cornmarket, one of the safer areas of the city for soldiers at this stage in "the Troubles". The three previous shootings that year had occurred in different circumstances, during rioting. One report said that the three Scottish soldiers were enticed into a car by Republican women who promised them a party.&lt;ref name="LostLives"/&gt; The three were taken to the White Brae, Squire's Hill, off the Ligoniel Road in North Belfast. There they were murdered by Provisional IRA members; two were shot in the back of the head and the other in the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Scots soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|John McCaig, Dougald McCaughey, and Joseph McCaig, the three killed Scottish soldiers]] The inquest in August 1971 was not able to establish the exact sequence of events.  It was established that all three were shot at very close range, probably in a line. All had been drinking, and Joseph was found to be severely [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]]. The jury was told that the three were probably shot whilst relieving themselves beside the road. The [[coroner]] commented: "You may think that this was not only murder, but one of the vilest crimes ever heard of in living memory".&lt;ref name="LostLives"/&gt; The bodies were heaped on top of each other with two [[beer glasses]] lying near to them.&lt;ref name='time'&gt;{{cite news| title = Northern Ireland: An Appalling Crime| url = http://time-demo.newscred.com/article/27310beedc82ae77b1195f6d554d2ad1.html/edit| newspaper = [[Time Magazine]]| date = | accessdate = 6 March 2011| location = US| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110714173955/http://time-demo.newscred.com/article/27310beedc82ae77b1195f6d554d2ad1.html/edit| archive-date = 14 July 2011| dead-url = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to return to their barracks by 18:30 the three were listed as [[AWOL]]. Their bodies were found by children at 21:30.&lt;ref name='History'/&gt;&lt;ref name="LostLives"/&gt;&lt;ref name ='mirror'/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The day after the killings, British [[Home Secretary]] [[Reginald Maudling]] made a statement in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in which he informed the house that security arrangements for off-duty soldiers were being reviewed and suggested that the aim of the killers was to provoke the security forces into reprisals. He said that: {{quote|The battle now joined against the terrorists will be fought with the utmost vigour and determination. It is a battle against a small minority of armed and ruthless men whose strength lies not so much in their numbers as in their wickedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1971/mar/11/british-soldiers-northern-ireland-murder#S5CV0813P0_19710311_HOC_300 |title=BRITISH SOLDIERS, NORTHERN IRELAND (MURDER) HC Deb 11 March 1971 vol 813 cc597-605|publisher=Hansard |date=11 March 1971 |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Belfast, the cenotaph - geograph.org.uk - 611322.jpg|Belfast Cenotaph, focus of the public mourning in Belfast|200px|thumb]]
The funerals were held in Scotland with John and Joseph McCaig buried together in Ayr.&lt;ref name ='mirror'/&gt; Their older brother, serving with the [[Royal Marines]] in Singapore, was flown home for the service. That day, 20,000 people attended rallies in Belfast and [[Carrickfergus]]. In Belfast, the [[Belfast Cenotaph|cenotaph]] at the [[Belfast City Hall|City Hall]] was the focus of the mourning with 10,000 people attending including workers from factories in a gathering that stopped the traffic in the city centre. Many wept openly. The Reverend [[Ian Paisley]] led the mourners in laying dozens of wreaths. The crowd observed a two-minute silence and sang a hymn and the [[national anthem]].&lt;ref name="LostLives"/&gt;

The deaths led to a crisis for the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|government of Northern Ireland]] with calls for increased security measures. Ian Paisley demanded the Stormont Government's resignation, saying "We can no longer tolerate your weakness. You must go before the whole land is deluged with the blood of innocent men and women."&lt;ref name ='time'/&gt; On 12 March, 4,000 shipyard workers took to the streets of Belfast to demand [[Operation Demetrius|internment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

No one has been convicted of the killings. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported in November 2007 that three Provisional IRA men were responsible for the deaths: [[Martin Meehan (Irish republican)|Martin Meehan]] (died 2007)- Meehan was questioned over the killings but was never charged; Patrick McAdorey- McAdorey was shot and killed in August 1971 during a gun battle in the [[Ardoyne]] area of Belfast.

==Memorial==
The mother of the two McCaig brothers visited the site of their deaths in May 1972. She expressed a wish to leave a monument to her sons but was advised that it might well be damaged by vandals. She later said that she was touched by the wreaths and flowers that had been left at the spot.&lt;ref name="LostLives"/&gt;

On January 13, 2018, a false [[ballistic missile]] alert was issued via the [[Emergency Alert System]] and [[Commercial Mobile Alert System]] over television, radio, and cellphones in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Hawaii]]. The alert stated that there was an incoming ballistic missile threat to Hawaii, advised residents to seek shelter, and concluded "This is not a drill". The message was sent at 8:07&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone|local time]]. However, no [[Civil defense siren#United States 2|civil defense outdoor warning sirens]] were authorized or sounded by the state.

A second message, sent 38 minutes later, described the first as a "false alarm". State officials blamed a miscommunication during a drill at the [[Hawaii Emergency Management Agency]] for the first message. Governor [[David Ige]] publicly apologized for the erroneous alert, which caused panic and disruption throughout the state. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] and the [[Hawaii House of Representatives]] launched investigations into the incident, leading to the resignation of the state's emergency management administrator.

Pai said he hoped the reforms, which would take effect in late 2019 if approved by the FCC, would lead to greater use of the alert system in local emergency situations and prompt people to take alerts they receive more seriously.&lt;ref name="mccausland011418"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.recode.net/2018/1/8/16864564/fcc-pai-wireless-emergency-alerts-harvey-wildfire-reform|work=Recode|title=After Hurricane Harvey and the California wildfires, the FCC is aiming to upgrade the country's wireless alert system|first=Tony|last=Romm|date=January 8, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the missile is fired from North Korea, the missile would take approximately 20 minutes to reach Hawaii. [[United States Pacific Command|PACOM]] would take less than 5 minutes to make a determination that the missile could impact Hawaii and would then notify the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA). HI-EMA would issue the Civil Defense Warning (CDW) that an inbound missile could impact Hawaii and that people should Shelter-in-Place: ''Get Inside, Stay Inside, and Stay Tuned''. People in Hawaii would have 12 to 15 minutes before impact. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is not required to be notified for approval to cancel an alert. Signal carriers allow people to block alerts from state and law enforcement agencies, but not those issued by the President. FEMA can send alerts to targeted audiences but has not implemented this as of January 2018. Other states can take as long as 30 minutes to create, enter and distribute a missile alert.

===State response===
By 8:10&amp;nbsp;a.m. HST, officials later said, [[Hawaii National Guard]] Adjutant General [[Arthur J. Logan|Arthur "Joe" Logan]] had contacted [[United States Pacific Command|U.S. Pacific Command]] and confirmed there had been no missile launch.&lt;ref name=SchaefersNoSafeguards/&gt; At that time, the [[Honolulu Police Department]] was notified that the alert had been a false alarm. Officials used the State Warning Point system at 8:13&amp;nbsp;a.m. to cancel the alert, preventing it from being sent out to any phones that had not already received it, such as those that were switched off or did not have reception.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kitv.com/story/37260689/hawaii-emergency-officials-release-timeline-of-false-ballistic-missile-alert|title=Hawaii emergency officials release timeline of false ballistic missile alert|agency=KITV 4|date=January 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employee who originally sent out the erroneous notification did not respond when directed to cancel the alert, according to state officials.&lt;ref name="kang013018"/&gt; He later said he felt like he had been dealt a "body blow" upon realizing the supposed attack had been a drill, the [[Associated Press]] reported.&lt;ref name="kelleher020218"/&gt; Another unidentified worker grabbed the employee's computer mouse and cancelled the alert when the first employeee failed to respond.&lt;ref name="peterkin021318"/&gt;

Official messages refuting the emergency alert were not sent out until 8:20&amp;nbsp;a.m., according to the timeline released by officials after the incident. [[Hawaii Emergency Management Agency]] accounts on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] posted messages at that time urging people to disregard the erroneous alert. Minutes later, Governor [[David Ige]] retweeted the HI-EMA message on Twitter and posted a similar message on Facebook to notify followers that the alert had been canceled.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; Ige later said the delay was caused in part by the fact he did not know his Twitter login information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/01/22/breaking-news/after-false-missile-alarm-ige-couldnt-log-on-to-twitter/|work=Honolulu Star-Advertiser|title=After false missile alarm, Ige couldn't log on to Twitter|date=January 22, 2018|accessdate=January 30, 2018|first=Kevin|last=Dayton}}&lt;/ref&gt; An email from the state was also sent at about 8:25&amp;nbsp;a.m. advising that the initial alert was not correct, the ''[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]'' reported.&lt;ref name="hsa011318"&gt;{{cite news|title='Wrong button' sends out false missile alert|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/01/13/breaking-news/emergency-officials-mistakenly-send-out-missile-threat-alert/|work=Honolulu Star-Advertiser|date=January 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic highway signs were also used to spread the word that the alert had been issued "in error" and that there was no threat to Hawaii.&lt;ref name="fox011418"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/01/14/hawaiis-false-missile-threat-worker-feels-terrible-after-pushing-wrong-button.html|agency=Fox News|title=Hawaii's false missile threat: Worker 'feels terrible' after pushing the wrong button|first1=Nicole|last1=Darrah|first2=Kathleen|last2=Joyce|date=January 14, 2018|accessdate=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second alert====
At 8:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. HST, 38 minutes after the initial alert was sent to smartphones in Hawaii,&lt;ref name="barr011318"/&gt; a second emergency alert was sent, which stated:&lt;ref name="bowden011318"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/368902-nearly-40-minutes-elapse-between-hawaii-missile-report-and-false-alarm|work=The Hill|first=John|last=Bowden|date=January 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2018|title=38 minutes elapse between Hawaii missile alert and false alarm announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no missile threat or danger to the State of Hawaii. Repeat. False Alarm.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second alert was sent "well after everyone from Hawaii's congressional delegation to the U.S. Pacific Command had assured the world on Twitter that it was a false alarm", ''[[American City Business Journals|Pacific Business News]]'' remarked.&lt;ref name="magin011318"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hawaii officials take 38 minutes to cancel false incoming ballistic alert|work=Pacific Business News|first=Janis|last=Magin|date=January 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2018|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2018/01/13/hawaii-officials-take-38-minutes-to-cancel-false.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor [[David Ige]] explained at a news conference that afternoon that officials "had to initiate a manual process" and obtain authorization from the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] in order to send the second alert, because there was no automated way to countermand the first alert.&lt;ref name="nbc011318"/&gt; Those procedures accounted for the delay more than 30 minutes after officials had confirmed internally that the alert was inaccurate, according to officials.&lt;ref name="nbc011318"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

===Federal officials===
Members of [[Hawaii Congressional delegation|Hawaii's congressional delegation]] also took to Twitter to dispel the false alarm. Congresswoman [[Tulsi Gabbard]] tweeted at 8:19&amp;nbsp;a.m. HST, about 12 minutes after the initial alert was sent, stating in all capitals that the message was a "false alarm" and that she had confirmed with officials that there was no incoming ballistic missile toward Hawaii.&lt;ref name="david011318"/&gt; The next day, she told [[CNN]] that the incident highlighted the need for President [[Donald Trump]] to negotiate with [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Jong-un]] to resolve nuclear tensions between the [[United States]] and North Korea, and she called for those responsible for the erroneous alert in Hawaii "to be held accountable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/14/politics/tulsi-gabbard-hawaii-cnntv/index.html|agency=CNN|title=Gabbard: 'Unacceptable' false alarm missile warning in Hawaii underscores need for talks with North Korea|first=Eli|last=Watkins|date=January 14, 2018|accessdate=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congresswoman [[Colleen Hanabusa]], a [[Hawaii gubernatorial election, 2018|2018 candidate for governor]], tweeted that the "panic and fear created by this false alarm was very dangerous".&lt;ref name="magin011318"/&gt; In further comments, Hanabusa panned the delay between the two emergency alerts, suggesting it should not have taken 38 minutes for the second message to be sent.&lt;ref name="hnn2011318"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/37260017/lawmakers-demand-answers-on-states-response-to-false-missile-threat|agency=Hawaii News Now|title=Lawmakers demand answers on false missile alarm — and state's response|date=January 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Mazie Hirono]] tweeted that officials "need to get to the bottom of what happened and make sure it never happens again".&lt;ref name="cohen011318"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/13/politics/hawaii-missile-threat-false-alarm/index.html|agency=CNN|title=Missile threat alert for Hawaii a false alarm|first=Zachary|last=Cohen|date=January 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his own tweets immediately after the incident, Senator [[Brian Schatz]] repeated that the first alert had been a false alarm. He described the erroneous alert message as "totally inexcusable", adding,&lt;ref name="joyce011318"/&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole state was terrified. There needs to be tough and quick accountability and a fixed process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commander David Benham, a spokesman for [[United States Pacific Command|U.S. Pacific Command]], confirmed to media that there was no imminent missile threat to Hawaii.&lt;ref name="cohen011318"/&gt; A spokesman for [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) stated that "NORAD did not see anything that indicated any sort of threat to Hawaii" and said NORAD and [[United States Northern Command|U.S. Northern Command]] were still verifying what had happened.&lt;ref name="lat011318"/&gt; A [[White House]] official said the alert had been part of "a state exercise" and President Trump was briefed on the situation.&lt;ref name="cohen011318"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/hawaii-ballistic-missile-not-drill-false-alarm-text-message-tulsi-gabbard-mistake-a8157971.html|title=Hawaii ballistic missile alert latest: 'Whole state terrified' after text message sent by mistake|work=Independent|date=January 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump ordered National Security Advisor [[H.R.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary [[Kirstjen Nielsen]] said the incident was "unfortunate" and officials were working to prevent a similar false alert from being issued in the future.&lt;ref name="voa011418"/&gt; Speaking on [[Fox News]] the next day, she said people "can trust government systems" and should pay attention to any alerts they receive from authorities in the future, in spite of the January 13 incident in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="afp011418"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.afp.com/en/news/23/us-official-defends-early-warning-systems-after-hawaii-failure-doc-wj4d66|agency=Agence France Presse|date=January 14, 2018|accessdate=January 14, 2018|title=US official defends early-warning systems after Hawaii 'failure'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabbard stated in an interview after the second emergency alert was sent that the incident was "a taste of the stark reality of what we face here of a potential nuclear strike on Hawaii", referring to the possibility of a [[North Korea]]n attack.&lt;ref name="bowden011318"/&gt; She and former Secretary of Defense [[William J. Perry]] both said the false alert highlighted the possibility of an "accidental nuclear war", in which a technical or human error leads to the [[nuclear warfare|use of nuclear weapons]] due to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation.&lt;ref name="fisher011418"/&gt;&lt;ref name="afp011418"/&gt;

===State officials===
[[File:Governor David Ige.jpg|thumb|200px|right|David Ige, who served as [[Governor of Hawaii]] at the time of the crisis.]]
[[Honolulu]] Mayor [[Kirk Caldwell]] also tweeted that the message had been a false alarm, saying the message had been sent in error, before the second alert was sent out by the [[Hawaii Emergency Management Agency]].&lt;ref name="von quednow011318"/&gt;

HI-EMA administrator [[Vern Miyagi]] took responsibility for the incident,&lt;ref name="magin011318"/&gt; ultimately resigning over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/01/30/breaking-news/ige-to-announce-results-of-false-missile-alert-investigation/|work=Honolulu Star-Advertiser|title=HI-EMA's Miyagi resigns, 'button pusher' fired in aftermath of false missile alert|date=January 30, 2018|accessdate=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miyagi described the initial warning as a "mistake",&lt;ref name="cohen011318"/&gt; saying it "should have been caught" before the alert was sent out.&lt;ref name="cowan011318"/&gt; HI-EMA officials, including Miyagi, said there was no evidence that the agency's systems had been [[cybercrime|hacked]] to send the false emergency message.&lt;ref name="nyt011318"/&gt;

Miyagi apologized for the false alert, as did Governor [[David Ige]], who called the incident "unfortunate and regrettable". They said officials would review the state's procedures to prevent it from happening again.&lt;ref name="cowan011318"/&gt; Ige said:&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know first-hand how today's false alarm affected all of us here in Hawaii, and I am sorry for the pain and confusion it caused. I, too, am extremely upset about this and am doing everything I can do to immediately improve our emergency management systems, procedures and staffing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hawaii Senate]] Majority Leader [[J. Kalani English]] said he was "outraged" by the error, which caused unnecessary "panic and pandemonium" throughout the state.&lt;ref name="hnn2011318"/&gt; [[Hawaii House of Representatives]] Speaker [[Scott K. Saiki]] announced the House would investigate the incident:&lt;ref name="hsa011318"/&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;This system we have been told to rely upon failed and failed miserably today. I am deeply troubled by this misstep that could have had dire consequences. Measures must be taken to avoid further incidents that caused wholesale alarm and chaos today. Clearly, government agencies are not prepared and lack the capacity to deal with emergency situations. Apparently, the wrong button was pushed and it took over 30 minutes for a correction to be announced. Parents and children panicked during those 30 minutes. The Hawaii House of Representatives will immediately investigate what happened and there be consequences. This cannot happen again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The deputy adjutant of the [[Hawaii National Guard]] said that notwithstanding the erroneous alert, people should continue to follow instructions and take shelter if another alert is sent in the future.&lt;ref name="khon011318"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Investigations===

Oliveira, left, was tapped by the state of [[Hawaii]] to lead an internal investigation into the incident.]]
State officials held a news conference in the afternoon of January 13 to address the incident.&lt;ref name="fox011318"/&gt; State officials placed former [[Hawaii Army National Guard]] commander Bruce E. Oliveira in charge of internally investigating the events that resulted in the false alert being sent out. In his report, published January 30, Oliveira faulted "insufficient management controls, poor computer software design, and human factors" for the incident.&lt;ref name="post013018"/&gt;

Officials did not name the employee responsible for the error.&lt;ref name="kang013018"/&gt; [[Hawaii Emergency Management Agency]] head [[Vern Miyagi]] initially declined to say whether the employee, who he said felt "terrible" about the false alert, would face discipline.&lt;ref name="fox011418"/&gt; An agency spokesman said January 14 the employee had been "temporarily reassigned" to a position that did not allow him access to the emergency warning system, pending the result of the internal investigation.&lt;ref name="wang011418"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/5103320/hawaii-missile-test-worker-reassigned/|work=TIME|title=The Person Who Sent Hawaii's False Missile Alert Has Been Reassigned|first=Mahita|last=Gajanan|date=January 15, 2018|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employee was ultimately fired on January 26, following findings in Oliveira's investigation regarding his work history and failure to follow directions.&lt;ref name="post013018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kelleher020218"/&gt; A second employee, who was also not identified and whose role in the incident was not disclosed, was suspended without pay.&lt;ref name="kelleher020218"/&gt; Toby Clairmont, HI-EMA's executive officer, announced January 20 he planned to retire by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/01/22/breaking-news/hi-ema-executive-officer-clairmont-retiring-this-year/|work=Honolulu Star-Advertiser|title=HI-EMA executive officer Clairmont retiring this year|first=Kristen|last=Consillio|date=January 22, 2018|accessdate=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every state and local government that originates alerts needs to learn from these mistakes. Each should make sure they have adequate safeguards in place. … The public needs to be able to trust that when the government issues an alert it is indeed a credible alert.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Miyagi resigned as HI-EMA administrator the same day the state and federal reports were released.&lt;ref name="kang013018"/&gt; Clairmont announced his resignation a day later.&lt;ref name="kelleher020218"/&gt;

===Other official actions===
Then-administrator [[Vern Miyagi]] said the [[Hawaii Emergency Management Agency]] suspended tests while assessing what had happened following the incident. He also announced the agency immediately changed its procedures to require two people, instead of just one, to send out both test alerts and actual alerts.&lt;ref name="fox011318"/&gt; HI-EMA employees will be "counseled and drilled so this never happens again", Miyagi said January 14.&lt;ref name="fox011418"/&gt;

Governor [[David Ige]] announced January 15 that he was appointing Brigadier General Kenneth Hara, Hawaii's deputy adjutant general, to oversee a review of the state's emergency management systems and procedures and implement reforms.&lt;ref name="hnn011518"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/37270842/in-address-to-state-governor-to-pledge-fixes-to-states-alert-system|agency=Hawaii News Now|title=Ige: False missile alert won't happen again; 'you have my promise'|date=January 15, 2018|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency also moved quickly to implement a cancellation command that officials said can be triggered within seconds of an erroneous alert being sent out, which it reportedly lacked before the January 13 incident.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; The Hawaii emergency alert interface screen was updated with a ''BMD False Alarm'' selection the same day, addressing a system deficiency that made it difficult for the state to countermand an alert sent in error.&lt;ref name=NinaWuJanuary16/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMDFalseAlarm/&gt;

HI-EMA reported that some of its employees received death threats after the false alert incident. In a rare public address, Ige called the threats "completely unacceptable" and said he was "ultimately responsible" for the error.&lt;ref name="hnn011518"/&gt;

Although Governor Ige's office issued on February 27, 2018, a ''Siren and Emergency Alert System Test'' for March 1, 2018,&lt;ref name=IgaAlertTestMarch&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Rapoza | first1 = Richard | last2 = Agbayani | first2 = Arlina | title = Siren and Emergency Alert System Test March 1, 2018 | url = https://governor.hawaii.gov/newsroom/latest-news/siren-and-emergency-alert-system-test-march-1-2018/ | work = Governor Ige newsroom | location = Honolulu | date = February 27, 2018 | access-date = March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the state of Hawaii did not test the nuclear warning siren in March and dropped its monthly test of the nuclear warning siren beginning on March 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Shapiro | first = David | title = Caution in order for nuclear alert plan | url = https://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/03/04/hawaii-news/fl-ash-back/caution-in-order-for-nuclear-alert-plan/ | newspaper = Star-Advertiser | location = Honolulu | date = March 4, 2018 | access-date = March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, the FCC issued a report and order which makes changes to EAS regulations to "improve the integrity, efficacy, and reliability" of the system and "minimize the potential for false alerts." The changes require EAS participants to configure their hardware to "reject Common Alerting Protocol-based alerts that contain an invalid digital signature and legacy (over-the-air)-based alerts whose expiration time falls outside of specific time limits", and report any false alarms to the FCC. The commission also implemented procedures for authorizing voluntarily participation in "live code" tests—public exercises that simulate an actual emergency in order to "promote greater proficiency" in the system by EAS operators and participants.

===Outside Hawaii===
North Korea's ''[[Rodong Sinmun]]'', the ruling Communist Party newspaper, described the false alarm as a "tragicomedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = North Korea mocks Trump, calls Hawaii's false alarm a 'tragicomedy' | url = https://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/01/16/breaking-news/north-korea-scoffs-at-trumps-nuclear-button-tweet/ | work = Star-Advertiser | location = Honolulu | agency = Associated Press and New York Times | date = January 16, 2018 | access-date = January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An official with the [[Alaska Division of Homeland Security &amp; Emergency Management|Division of Homeland Security &amp; Emergency Management]] in the U.S. state of [[Alaska]], also believed to be within the theoretical range of [[North Korea]]n [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear missiles]], said his department encourages Alaskans to [[shelter in place]] rather than trying to get elsewhere if there is an attack, as many people in Hawaii did after the false alert was issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ktva.com/story/37261774/alaska-taking-different-tack-from-hawaii-on-missile-alerts|agency=KTVA|title=Alaska taking different tack from Hawaii on missile alerts|date=January 14, 2018|accessdate=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Senator [[Brian Schatz]], one of Hawaii's two members of the [[United States Senate]], introduced federal legislation that would prohibit state and local agencies from notifying the public of a missile launch, placing the responsibility on federal authorities to make that determination.&lt;ref name="peterkin021318"/&gt;

'''Austrofascism''' ({{lang-de|Austrofaschismus}}) is a term used to describe the [[Fascism#Para-fascism|authoritarian system]] installed in [[Austria]] with the [[May Constitution of 1934]], which ceased with [[Anschluss|the annexation]] of the newly founded '''[[Federal State of Austria]]''' into [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. It was based on a ruling party, the [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]] (''Vaterländische Front'') and the [[Heimwehr]] (Home Guard) paramilitary militia. Leaders were [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and, after Dollfuss's assassination, [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], who were previously politicians of the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]], which was quickly integrated into the new movement.

Austrofascism, which was [[Catholic]] and corporatist and espoused [[Austrian nationalism]], must be contrasted with [[Austrian National Socialism]], which was [[Pan-Germanism|pan-German]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] in outlook.

== Origins ==
The Austrofascist movement's origin lies in the [[Korneuburg Oath]], a declaration released by the Christian Social paramilitary organization [[Heimwehr]] on 18 May 1930. The declaration condemned both the "[[Marxist]] class struggle" and the economic structures of "[[Economic liberalism|liberal-capitalism]]". Furthermore, it explicitly rejected "the Western democratic [[parliamentarism|parliamentary system]] and [[Multi-party system|[multi]-party state]]".

The declaration was directed mainly at the Social Democratic opposition, largely in response to the [[Linz Program of 1926]], and was not only taken by the Heimwehr but also by many Christian Social politicians, setting Austria on a course to an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] system.

Ideologically, Austrofascism was rooted in Austria's [[Catholic Church and politics|political Catholicism]]. It also somewhat resembled [[Italian fascism]] as expounded by [[Giovanni Gentile]].

== Transition towards a ''Ständestaat'' ==
The election in Vienna in 1932 made it likely that the coalition of Christian Social Party, the [[Landbund]], and the Heimwehr would lose their majority in the [[National Council of Austria|national parliament]], depriving the Austrian government of its parliamentary basis. To ensure proper and efficient governance over citizens, the government sought to replace Austrian democracy with an authoritarian system based in Austrian Catholic principles. These efforts were supported from abroad by [[Benito Mussolini]]. The ''{{lang|de|Ständestaat}}'' concept, derived from the notion of ''{{lang|de|Stände}}'' ("[[Estates of the realm|estates]]" or "[[Corporatism|corporations]]"), and constituted the form favoured form by Dollfuss and later by [[Kurt Schuschnigg]].

The opportunity for such a transition arrived on 4 March 1933 when the national parliament was [[Self-elimination of the Austrian Parliament|paralysed by procedural disputes]]. Dollfuss held a one-vote majority in parliament. During a dispute over a voting recount, the speaker and vice-speakers of parliament resigned in order to be able to cast their votes, and in the absence of the three speakers, there existed no procedural means to reconvene Parliament. Dollfuss branded this as the [[Self-elimination of the Austrian Parliament|"self-elimination of the Parliament"]] and proceeded to rule on the basis of the [[:de:Kriegswirtschaftliches Ermächtigungsgesetz|Wartime Economy Authorization Act]]. This law had been passed in 1917 during [[World War I]] to enable the government to issue decrees ensuring the supply of necessities. The law had never been explicitly revoked and was now used by the Austrian government to inaugurate an authoritarian state.

On 7 March 1933, the Council of Ministers issued a ban on assembly and protests. Press regulations were also levied by the Wartime Economy Authority Law and touted as economic safeguards. The law allowed for the government to require approval of a newspaper which had already been printed up to two hours before its distribution under certain circumstances, for instance if "through damage to patriotic, religious or moral sensibility, a danger to public peace, order and security" would arise.  This allowed for [[censorship]] of the press, but the government was eager to avoid the appearance of open censorship, which was forbidden by the constitution. The opposition made a final attempt to reverse the changes in parliament, which was met by police power on 15 March 1933. As ''[[Großdeutsche Lösung|Großdeutsche]]'', who advocated a merger with Germany, and Social Democrats arrived at the Parliament building, the government sent 200 detectives to Parliament to prevent the representatives from taking their places in the assembly hall.

On 31 March, the government dissolved the [[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]. On 10 April 1933, the [[:de:Glöckel-Erlass|decree]] by former Social Democratic Education Minister [[Otto Glöckel]], which had made Catholic religious lessons in schools non-mandatory, was abolished. On 10 May, all federal, state and local elections were cancelled. The [[Communist Party of Austria]] was dissolved on 26 May, the [[Austrian National Socialism|National Socialist Workers' Party]] (NSDAP) on 19 June, and the [[:de:Freidenkerbund Österreichs|Free Thinkers Guild]] on 20 June.

The Hotel Schiff, an asylum of the Social Democrats in Linz, was raided by the police in February 1934. The Social Democrats resisted, leading to the [[Austrian Civil War]], which was quelled with military and paramilitary force. Afterward, the Social Democratic Party was banned in Austria.

On 30 April 1934, the national parliament, in its last session, passed a law that enabled the government to assume all the powers previously held by parliament.

== May Constitution ==
{{details|topic=Austrian Civil War|July Putsch}}
{{details|topic=the structure of the state|Federal State of Austria}}
On 1 May, Dollfuss' government proclaimed [[May Constitution of 1934|the May Constitution]] (''Maiverfassung''), which diminished the term ''Republic'' and instead used as the official name of the state "[[Federal State of Austria]]" (''Bundesstaat Österreich''), though the constitution actually reduced the [[States of Austria|individual states]]' autonomy. The [[Federal Council of Austria|Federal Council]] was retained, though only as a significantly limited check on the Federal government. Rather than establishing the composition of a fifty-nine member [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] through direct suffrage, this was accomplished by four "Councils" representing the professionals from Austrian Culture, State affairs, the [[States of Austria]] (''Länder'') and Economic affairs (the latter elected by seven [[Corporatism|corporations]] supposedly representing workers and employers). The National Council lost its power to initiate legislation but was still expected to approve decrees from the government. All essential power lay with the Federal Chancellor (''Bundeskanzler''), who appointed his government single-handedly, and the Federal President (''Bundespräsident''), who named the Chancellor.&lt;br /&gt;As with [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Antonio de Salazar]]'s [[Constitution of Portugal#Constitution of 1933|1933 constitution]] (and the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime in whole), the ''Maiverfassung'' promoted a Catholic [[corporatism]] which bore a strong resemblance to the principles outlined in ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', rejecting [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]].

Chancellor Dollfuss was killed in July 1934, during an attempt by [[Austrian National Socialism|Austria's National Socialist Party]] to topple the regime and proclaim a [[Nazism|Nazi]] government under Ambassador to Rome [[Anton Rintelen]]. The assassination of Dollfuss was accompanied by Nazi uprisings in many regions in Austria, resulting in further deaths. In [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], a large contingent of northern German Nazis tried to grab power but were subdued by the loyalist Heimwehr units. The Nazi assassins holding the Federal Chancellery [[Vienna]] surrendered after threats to [[dynamite]] the building and were executed before the end of July. While Heimwehr leader Starhemberg briefly assumed power as Vice Chancellor, Kurt Schuschnigg was appointed Dollfuss' successor by President Miklas on 29 July, ousting Starhemberg from the government completely in 1936, before surrendering to Nazi pressure in March 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne ''A History of Fascism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Maiverfassung]]{{Better source|date=November 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons for the failure of the putsch was Italian intervention: Mussolini assembled an army corps of four divisions on the Austrian border and threatened Hitler with a war with Italy in the event of a German invasion of Austria as originally planned, should the coup have been more successful. Support for the Nazi movement in Austria was surpassed only by that in Germany, allegedly amounting to 75% in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882197-2,00.html|title=AUSTRIA: Eve of Renewal|date=25 September 1933|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements of Austrofascism ==

=== Fatherland Front ===
{{Main|Fatherland Front (Austria)}}
The ''Fatherland Front'' ({{lang-de|Vaterländische Front}}, '''VF''') was the ruling political organisation of "Austrofascism". It claimed to be a [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]] movement, and aimed to unite all the people of Austria, overcoming political and social divisions. Established on 20 May 1933 by [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social]] Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] as a [[One-party state|single party]] along the lines of [[Italian Fascism]], it advocated [[Austrian nationalism]] and independence from [[Nazi Germany]] on the basis of protecting Austria's Catholic religious identity from what they considered a Protestant-dominated German state.

=== Ideology and ideals ===
Austrofascism's ideology of the "community of the people" (''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'') was different from that of the [[National Socialists|herrenvolk &amp; lebensraum]]. They were similar in that both served to attack the idea of a [[class struggle]] by accusing leftism of destroying individuality, and thus help usher in a totalitarian state. Dollfuss' [[corporatist]] propositions were focused on the benefit of all members of the working class, from farmhands to fashion designers.

Austrofascism focused on the [[history of Austria]]. The Catholic Church played a large role in the Austrofascist definition of Austrian history and identity, which served to alienate German culture. According to this ideology, Austrians were "better [[Germans]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vsl6mwMXl4YC&amp;pg=PA37|title=Constructing and Deconstructing National Identity: Dramatic Discourse in Tom Murphy's The Patriot Game and Felix Mitterer's In Der Löwengrube|first=Birgit|last=Ryschka|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Peter Lang|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; (at this time, the majority of the German population was still [[Protestant]]) and Austria was a second but "better German state" which ought to remain independent from Germany. The monarchy was elevated to the ideal of a powerful and far-reaching state, a status which Austria lost after the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]]. 

Despite the Catholic emphasis that Dollfuss had created with the [[Federal State of Austria]], he was opposed to forcing Catholicism on to religious minorities, and also let Jews escaping [[Nazi Germany]] take refuge in Austria.

=== Legal process ===
After the parliament was dissolved, the government also dissolved the [[Constitutional Court]] (''Verfassungsgerichtshof''). The four Christian Social members of the Constitutional Court had resigned, and the government banned the nomination of new judges, effectively closing the court.

In September 1933, the government established internment camps for political opposition members. [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]], [[Socialists]], [[Communism|Communists]], and [[anarchism|Anarchists]] were all considered dissidents condemned to internment. After the [[July Putsch]] of 1934, [[National Socialist]]s were also regularly interned. On 11 November 1933, the government reinstated the [[death penalty]] for the crimes of murder, arson, and "public violence through malicious damage to others' property". In February 1934, rioting (''Aufruhr'') was added to the list of capital offenses.

[[John Gunther]] wrote in 1940 that the state "assaulted the rights of citizens in a fantastic manner", noting that in 1934 the police raided 106,000 homes in Vienna and made 38,141 arrests of Nazis, social democrats, and communists. He added, however:&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n437/mode/2up |title=Inside Europe |last=Gunther |first=John |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |location=New York|authorlink=John Gunther|year=1940 |page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|But—and it was an important "but"—the terror never reached anything like the repressive force of the Nazi terror. Most of those arrested promptly got out of jail again. Even at its most extreme phase, it was difficult to take the Schuschnigg dictatorship completely seriously, although Schutzbunders tried in 1935 got mercilessly severe sentences. This was because of Austrian gentleness, Austrian genius for compromise, Austrian love for cloudy legal abstractions, and Austrian ''{{linktext|Schlamperei}}''.}}

=== Education ===

By 1933, a series of laws had already been passed to bring the educational system in Austria into line with Austrofascism. The Catholic Church was, under the new government, able to exert significant influence on educational policy, which had previously been secularised. In order to pass the ''Matura'' (the test required for graduation), a student had to have taken religious education classes. Educational opportunities for women were significantly limited under the new regime.

Post-secondary education was also targeted by the new regime. The number of professors and assistants fell as the government produced legal grounds for deposing those who were critical of the new regime. Disciplinary actions, previously the responsibility of individual universities, were relegated to the government. Only members of the Fatherland Front were allowed to become university officials.

=== Economic policy ===
By 1930, foreign trade to and from Austria moved away from a free market system and became an extension of the autocratic government.{{Clarify|date=September 2016}} Chief among the changes was the closing of the Austrian market to foreign trade in response to the [[Black Thursday|New York stock exchange crisis]] in 1929.

Unemployment grew drastically, between 1932 and 1933 by over 25 percent. In response, the government created  the so-called "Cooperations" of workers and enterprises.

=== Culture ===
The official cultural policy of the Austrofascist government was the affirmation of the [[Baroque]] and other "pre-revolutionary" styles. The government encouraged a cultural mindset reminiscent of the times before the [[French Revolution]]. This recalled images of the "Threat from the East" – the invasion of Europe by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] – which were then projected onto the [[Soviet Union]]. In this way, the government warned its people against what it called "[[cultural Bolshevism]]", a force which it claimed posed a great threat to Austria.

=== Minimal antisemitism ===
There was no official policy of [[antisemitism]] between 1933 and 1938. Public violence against Jews was rare. As the Austrofascist state saw itself under the growing pressure by Nazi Germany which penalized its citizens who travelled to Austria with a 1000 Mark fee, and even more so after the failed Nazi coup against the Austrian government in July 1934, many Jews supported the regime.

The history of the austrofascist movement was rooted partially in one of its predecessor parties, the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]].  One of the more notorious of that party's founders, [[Karl Lueger]] was a noted anti-Semite who is often considered to have had a formative influence on [[Adolf Hitler]] during his time in Vienna.

Still, austrofascist officials supported the [[Salzburg Festival]] which employed famous Jewish artists like [[Herbert Graf]], [[Alexander Moissi]], [[Max Reinhardt]], [[Richard Tauber]], [[Margarete Wallmann]], and [[Bruno Walter]]. Walter was also a leading conductor for the [[Vienna State Opera]] until 1938 and conducted several concerts given by the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]]. Therefore, the festival was harshly criticised by German officials and boycotted by German artists like [[Richard Strauss]], [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], and [[Clemens Krauss]]. The Festival also came under attack by Austrian antisemites and exponents of right-wing parties.

Many Jews fled Germany and found a temporary refuge in Austria. Artists like filmmaker [[Henry Koster]] and producer [[Joe Pasternak]] could not work in Germany any longer and continued to produce films in Austria. Vienna's [[Theater in der Josefstadt]] provided many Jewish actors, playwrights, and directors with the opportunity to continue their work, among them Reinhardt, [[Albert Bassermann]], [[Egon Friedell]], [[Hans Jaray]], [[Otto Preminger]] (the theater's managing director until 1935), [[Ernst Lothar]] (managing director until 1938), and [[Franz Werfel]]. Jewish athletes made the [[SC Hakoah Wien]] one of the most successful athletic clubs in Austria before 1938. Its athletes excelled on many occasions throughout Europe.

Yet there was a purge of public offices, and many Jews were fired from their posts on the accusations that they were Communist or Social-Democratic sympathizers. There were occasional outbursts of antisemitism in right-wing newspapers. However, Jews continued to be an integral part of Austrian society until March 1938. But some of them lost their hopes for a fruitful future and left Austria before 1938, especially following the ''Juliabkommen'' 1936 between Austria and Germany which provided an amnesty for illegal Nazis. Among the most prominent Jews who left Austria before 1938 were [[Stefan Zweig]] and [[Otto Preminger]].

== Demise ==
{{Main|Anschluss}}
The regime lasted as long as the favour of Fascist Italy under Mussolini protected it against the expansionist aims of [[Nazi Germany]]. However, when Mussolini sought to end Italy's own increasing international isolation by forming [[Rome-Berlin Axis|an alliance with Hitler]] in 1938, Austria was left alone to face increasing German pressure.

To protect Austria's independence, Schuschnigg reached an agreement with Hitler under which 17,000 Austrian Nazis received amnesty and were integrated into the fold of the Fatherland Front. [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], the leader of the Austrian Nazis, was appointed Minister of the Interior and Security. As Nazi pressure continued, now supported from within the government, Schuschnigg tried to rally popular support for Austria's independence by a referendum. Hitler reacted by alleging an attempt at a fraudulent vote and demanded that Schuschnigg should hand over the government to the Austrian Nazis or face invasion. Schuschnigg, unable to find support in France or the United Kingdom, resigned to avoid bloodshed. After an interlude, in which Nazis had gained control of Vienna, President Miklas, who had at first refused, appointed Seyss-Inquart Chancellor, who then requested military occupation by the German army. The next day, Hitler entered Austria and declared it a part of the German Reich, which was subsequently formalized on March 15.

The '''''Book of the Consulate of the Sea''''' or '''''Book of the Consulate of Sea''''' is a compendium of [[maritime law]] that governed [[trade]] in the [[Mediterranean]] for centuries. Of Catalan origin, it was translated into many languages and served as the basis for current international [[maritime law]].

When setting the first [[Consulate of the Sea]] in Valencia, king [[Peter III of Aragon]] decided to apply the maritime customs of Barcelona, called ''costums de mar'', which had not yet been codified, although there did already exist in Barcelona another compilation of maritime rules, called '' [[Ordinacions de Ribera]]'', which established norms for policing harbours and coastal waters.&lt;ref name="Chacon" /&gt;''

The merit of the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' is that it is the first work to collect the scattered laws and customs of Roman, Greek, Byzantine, Rhodian, Italian, French and Spanish maritime rights''.&lt;ref name = safe /&gt;''

Until the publication of the '' Ordonnance de la Marine '' in France in 1681,&lt;ref&gt;[http://editions.larcier.com/resources/titles/28044100927430/extras/ forward - propos.pdf maritime Code. Avant-propos]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' was the code of maritime law in force throughout the Mediterranean. In Spain it continued in use until the introduction of the Spanish ''[[Commercial code (law)|Commercial Code]].'' ''The Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' effectively replaced the [[Amalfian Laws|Amalfi Tables]], a set of rules written in the [[Amalfi Republic|Amalfi]] to regulate maritime trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyoflaw.info/maritime-law-history.html Maritime law history]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

According to Chiner and Chacon, the Ordinances of the Ribera (i.e. seaside) ('' [[Ordianationis Ripairiœ]] ''), written in 1258, did not yet encode the maritime customs of Barcelona, and that the first reference to "Sea consuls" appears in Barcelona in 1282, just one year before the Consulate of the Sea was created in Valencia. Also note that the consuls of Barcelona had no independence assigned later on in the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea''. Customs collected in the book would be in part coming from a Barcelona origin,  but many would have been created and consolidated in Valencia, from which have been copied to the subsequently created consulates. According to Arcadi Garcia Sanz, the main difference between the consulates of Barcelona and Valencia would be the fact that the latter had from the start a "royal jurisdiction", and therefore has influenced so strongly in the other consulates in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name = Chacon /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanz1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arcadi García i Sanz|title=Història de la Catalan Navya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUgSAAAAYAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Ed. Aedos|isbn=978-84-7003-161-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customs Consulate were explicitly based on the '' Usus at consuetudo Maris '' according to the privilege of founding of the December 1 of 1283, which was a juridic set of maritime practices ('' Usus Maris'') based on a written legal text ''(Consuetudo Maris) a''nd both together would be the jurídicomarítima tradition of the western Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Chacon" /&gt; is documented that the text was already in Catalonia, as it was in Vic 1231, and was incorporated in Catalan in the 'Custom of Tortosa in 1272.&lt;ref name = Chacon /&gt; This paper certainly come from outside the Peninsula and have introduced through "maritime Costums of Ribera" from Barcelona.&lt;ref name = Chacon /&gt;

The ''General Encyclopedia of the Sea'' says there is a controversy on the origin of the book, in which three countries dispute the glory of being the first to have written it: France ([[Marseille]]), Spain ([[Valencia]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Tortosa]]) and [[Italy]] ([[Pisa]]).&lt;ref name = enci /&gt;

In the late eighteenth century, [[Antonio de Capmany y Montpalau]] concludes, after deeply studying the subject, that the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' was written in Barcelona between 1258 and 1266, &lt;ref Name = capmany2 /&gt; accepting the influence from [[Pisa]], and he rejecting the arguments that gave an Italian origin to the book.&lt;ref name = capmany2&gt;Capmany, p. XII-xxv&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[Sardinia]]n Domenico Azun argues in favor of a Pisan origin, stating that, Pisa as a leading maritime power of the time, should necessarily have their own maritime legislation. French Pardessus, in his study ''Collection de lois maritimes anterieures au XVIII siècle'' disagrees from Azun, considering that the first copy is not the one written in [[Latin]] that he had studied, but the one written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]. He assumes that it was handwritten in Barcelona, but between 1340 and 1400, disagreeing on this point with Capmany. Later, Wildscut, considering that the original compilation makes no reference to the [[Bill of exchange|Bills of exchange]], he concludes that this Catalan document must predate the first half of the 13th century.&lt;ref name=enci&gt;Enciclopedia General del Mar. Ediciones Garriga Barcelona (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence and impact ==
The expansion of the Crown of Aragon and its commercial and maritime supremacy meant that the '' Book of the Consulate of the Sea '' was respected throughout the Mediterranean and up into the Atlantic. Based originally on the maritime customs of Barcelona and supplemented by the Valencia Consulate of the Sea, the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' laid the basis for all subsequent Mediterranean maritime customs.&lt;ref name = Chacon /&gt;

Originally written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' was translated into [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Castilian]] and other languages, and for centuries was the basis of merchant marine legislation in many countries, even up to modern times.

An annex of the book contains Barcelona's ordinances of 1435 on marine insurance. The wide circulation of the book helped spread these ordinances throughout Europe.&lt;ref name = safe /&gt;

The [[Nueva Planta decrees]] (1707 - 1716) entirely suppressed the Consulates of the Sea in the Crown of Aragon, except in Mallorca and Barcelona. The latter did not usually act in interference with the Bourbon laws. The rules of the Book of the Consulate of the Sea were active in Spain until 1829, when they were replaced by the [[Spain|Spanish]] code of commerce, inspired by [[France|French]] law.

Several European countries continued to use these ordinances until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name = Chacon /&gt; In 1874 [[Travers Twiss|Sir Travers Twiss]] translated them into English for reasons of utility, in the early twentieth century a court in the United States denied an action on the grounds of its not being supported by the ''Consulate of the Sea,'' and in March 1937 the Court of Appeal of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] quoted a chapter of the book in its judgment.&lt;ref name = Chacon /&gt;

== Editions ==

=== First compilation 1320-1330 ===

The first Valencian collection of customs sea was made in Valencia between 1320 and 1330. &lt;ref Name = Chacon /&gt;

===Majorcan Edition 1345===
&lt;Nowiki&gt; The city of Mallorca surrendered to Pedro of Aragon, and in 1343 he was awarded the Consulate of Mar de Mallorca, governed by the customs of Valencia, "per modum the form in civitate Valencia usitatos". According to Arcadi Garcia Sanz, he became an adaptation and not a replica. Huguet Borras drafted the &lt;/nowiki&gt;''Ordre judiciària de la Cort dels cònsols del mar de la ciutat de València'';  (''judiciary Order of the Court of consuls Sea of the city of Valencia) '' and rewrote the Valencian customs, creating a compilation called ''  apítols del Consolat de mar de Mallorques (chapters of the Sea Consulate of Mallorca), '' documented for the first time on 14 February 1345.&lt;ref name = Chacon /&gt;

=== Valencian Consulat de Mar 1407 ===
It is considered the masterpiece of medieval maritime law, and one of the icons of valencian jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valencia.es/ayuntamiento/publicaciones.nsf/vPubAnyoCApoyo/5CDAAB2A2F92D7F5C1257296002D132E?OpenDocument&amp;lang=2&amp;nivel=3_2 1407 facsimile of the manuscript]{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original manuscript is preserved in the Municipal Archives of Valencia. It is a work of great historical value with great international impact through the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soitu.es/soitu/2008/07/25/info/1216937643_904857.html delivery Rita Barbera copy in the Library of Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several medieval manuscript copies, although one of the finest examples from the artistic point of view is the codex called "Consolat del Mar" with miniatures from Domingo Crespi made in 1407, kept in the Municipal Archives of Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = http://www.fuesp.com/revistas/pag/cai0715.html|title=Contribució the State of the issue of the legal iconographic studies illustrated manuscripts in the Middle Ages | publisher = Art and Iconography Notebooks / Volume IV - 7. 1991 | year = 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.valencia.es/ayuntamiento/Infociudad_accesible.nsf/vDocumentosWebListado/86DCDAD8C37B97EFC12572C20023B7B6?OpenDocument&amp;bdOrigen=&amp;idapoyo=&amp;nivel=3&amp;lang=1|title=Infociudad: Town hall and its urban environment - Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First publication in print between 1436 and 1484 ===

With the advent of the printing press, the first known printed edition is the one of 1436 - 1484 from [[Valencia]].&lt;ref name = safe&gt;[http://www.mercadoasegurador.com ar / adetail.asp? id = 546 were baptized insurance Seawater]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barcelona Edition of 1502 (Foreword by Francisco Celelles) ===

Pedro the Ceremonious gave Barcelona its [[Consulate of the Sea]] saying he would be in the same form as that of Mallorca, "sub ea scilicet forma qua concessum est civitati Maioricarum".&lt;ref name = Chacon /&gt; Customs adapted from Valencia in Mallorca, and from there in Barcelona.&lt;ref name = Chacon /&gt;&lt;ref name = capmany3&gt;Capmany, p. 317-318&lt;/ref&gt;

Capmany says that because of these adaptation the first seven chapters dealt with matters that were only useful for Valencia Sea consuls, and several laws and ordinances from Barcelona were added indiscriminately,&lt;ref name = capmany3 /&gt; adding that the rest of chapters of the ordinations that form the biggest part of the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' was not copied from Mallorca and Valencia, but was compiled thereof from Barcelona customs known as '' free Consulate of the Sea '' and being those Barcelona's customs compiled within the Valencian ordinations by early printers have caused confusion in later authors, who have given a Valencian origin when in fact they have originated in Barcelona.&lt;ref name = capmany3 /&gt;

The first edition came out of print on 14 August 1502.&lt;ref&gt;Capmany, p. xxxv&lt;/ref&gt;

Part I consists of 43 chapters that prescribe methods to choose the consuls of the sea and appellate judges in [[Valencia]], the legal responsibilities of each and the procedural regulations of awards of cases brought before them. Articles 44 and 45 were discarded, probably for being illegible, as shipments concerned towards Alexandria&lt;ref name = "iberian_preface"&gt;{{Cite book | url = http://libro.uca.edu/Consulate/Consulate.htm | title = (a) The Consulate of the Sea and Related Documents Library of Iberian Resources Online | year = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part II consisted of Articles 46 to 334 of the laws of the year 1343. The first area of Article 46 to 297, deals with generally accepted customs of maritime trade, while the second area, up to 298 items 334, it deals with the [[pirate]]s, piracy, armed naval expeditions, convoys, [[marine insurance]], bills of exchange and other various materials. The original manuscript of the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris has the following inscription appearing at the end of Article 217: "El llibre acaba aquí. Gloria a Jesus Cristo. Amen" ("The book ends here Gloria Jesus Christ, amen.")&lt;ref name = "iberian_preface" /&gt;

==== First Lawyers ====

Article 43 prescribes the oath of office for the lawyers of Mallorca, decreed by [[James I of Aragon]] and promulgated before the year 1275. It is not known when or by whom it was imposed an oath to lawyers of Barcelona and other cities.&lt;ref name = "iberian_preface" /&gt;

==== Moliné y Brasés edition of 1914 ====

== Compilations in the antiquity ==
The oldest collection is probably the Babylonian index, from the eighteenth century BC, followed by the "Phoenician customs" compiled in 2000 BC, that were copied by the Greeks and later by the Romans. The people of Rhodes directly adapted the Phoenician laws.&lt;ref name = iberian_preface /&gt; The Greeks have founded a Greek colony in [[Empuries]] and kept a constant sea trade with [[Greece]] following therefore the "Greek costums".&lt;ref name="Simonis2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Damien Simonis|title=Lonely Planet Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B1pFbOvxN1wC&amp;pg=PA386&amp;dq=greek+colony+of+empuries&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwA2oVChMIhvPwkMKFyQIVxtYUCh0d8Az-#v=onepage&amp;q=greek%20colony%20of%20empuries&amp;f=false|date=15 September 2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74220-379-9|pages=386–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compilations from which originated ==
The book was inspired distantly from previous compilations, as the Pisan ''Constitutum usus'' (1161) and ''Breve consulum maris''&amp;nbsp; (1162) and the Latin text ''Consuetudo maris '' of the first half of the 13th century, which has been documented in Catalonia in 1231.&lt;ref name = Chacon&gt;{{Cite book |  author =JJ Chiner Gimeno, JP Galiana Chacon | chapter = Del 'of the Sea' in the 'Book of the Sea called' historical approach | title = Book called Sea Consulate (Valencia, 1539) | place = Valencia | year = 2003 | editor = Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation of Valencia | pages = 7–42 | url = http://bv2.gva.es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000771&amp;responsabilidad_civil=where}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1010 were codified in [[Amalfi Republic|Amalfi]] the ''Tabula Amalphitana ''or ''Tavole Amalfi ''followed by the codification of maritime customs of [[Trani]] in 1063, which were then adapted by the city of [[Fermo]].&lt;ref name = iberian_preface /&gt;

In 1243 [[James I of Aragon]] has demarcated the Ribera (seaside) of [[Barcelona]] and its ordinances were codified in 1258 in the ''Carta consulatus riparie Barchinone'', which had not yet codified the maritime customs of Barcelona itself. Shortly afterwards, Barcelona's municipal boundaries were reorganized and the Ribera (seaside) came under the Consell de Cent, so the Ribera (seaside) lost its autonomy. In the last quarter of the 13th century Barcelona consuls they started naming the great men of the Ribera (seaside), which in 1282 were named "consols de mar" ("consuls of sea").&lt;ref name = Chacon /&gt;

== Compilations with its influence ==

Many authors believe that the laws specified in the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' had a big influence on all other compilations of maritime law in Europe, which are partly based on it.&lt;ref name = iberian_preface /&gt;

Some of these laws specified in the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' were already adopted in the ninth century in places like the Baltic, the North Sea, the [[Schleswig]] sea: [[Riga]], [[Wisby]], [[Hamburg]], [[Lübeck]] and other cities of the [[Hanseatic League]], being published since 1407 under the title '' Waterrecht '', also called [[laws of Wisby]].&lt;ref name = iberian_preface /&gt;

According to some authors the [[Rules of Oléron]] were compiled by [[Edward I of England]] and expanded and promulgated by [[Richard I of England]] on his return from the Holy Land, but others say [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] would have proclaimed them already in 1160.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact is that the exact origin of these laws is disputed and, given the lack of communication between sailors of the Atlantic and Mediterranean sailors, it is possible the absence of influence between them. However, laws compiled in the Mediterranean eventually surpassed in importance those of the Atlantic and arrived to replace them, as the Mediterranean countries used to have more maritime activity during several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Spanish Marina Middle Ages: Historical sketch of the main events in connection with the history of the crowns of Aragon and Castile, Volume 1 | author = Francisco Xavier de Salas and Rodriguez | publisher = T.

[[Image:Llibre del Consolat de Mar 1814.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The title page of the 1914 edition of the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'', edited by Ernest Moliné y Brasés.]]
The full title in Catalan is '''''Les costums marítimes de Barcelona universalment conegudes per Llibre del Consolat de mar''''', or '''''The maritime customs of Barcelona universally known as the Book of the Consulate of the Sea'''''. The earliest extant printed edition of the work (Barcelona, 1494) is without a title-page or frontispiece, but it is described by the above-mentioned title in the epistle dedicatory prefixed to the table of contents. The only known copy of this edition (as of 1911) is preserved in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name ="EB11"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jados"&gt;Jados (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; The epistle dedicatory states that the work is an amended version of the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'', compiled by [[Francis Celelles]] with the assistance of numerous [[shipmaster]]s and [[merchant]]s well versed in maritime affairs.

According to a statement made by [[Antonio de Capmany y Montpalau|Capmany]] in his ''Codigo de los costumbras maritimas de Barcelona'', published at [[Madrid]] in 1791, there was extant to his knowledge an older edition, printed in semi-Gothic characters, which he believed to be of a date prior to 1484.&lt;ref name="EB11" /&gt;

There are, however, two Catalan manuscripts preserved in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the earliest of which, being ''MS. Espagnol 124'', contains the two first treatises which are printed in the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' of 1494, and which are the most ancient portion of its contents, written in a hand of the 14th century, on paper of that century. The subsequent parts of this manuscript are on paper of the 15th century, but there is no document of a date more recent than 1436. The later of the two manuscripts, being ''MS. Espagnol 56'', is written throughout on paper of the 15th century, and in a hand of that century, and it purports, from a certificate on the face of the last leaf, to have been executed under the superintendence of [[Peter Thomas (notary)|Peter Thomas]], a [[notary public]], and the scribe of the Consulate of the Sea at Barcelona.&lt;ref name="EB11" /&gt;

The edition of 1494 contains, in the first place, a code of procedure issued by the kings of [[Aragon]] for the guidance of the courts of the consuls of the sea, in the second place, a collection of ancient customs of the sea, and thirdly, a body of rules for the government of cruisers of war. A [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] at the end of these ordinances informs the reader that the book commonly called the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' ends here; after which there follows a document known by the title of ''The Acceptations'', which purports to record that the previous chapters and ordinances had been approved by the "Roman" people in 1075, and by various princes and peoples in the 12th and 13th centuries: this is generally regarded as of no historical value.&lt;ref name="EB11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moliné"&gt;Moliné y Brasés (1914).&lt;/ref&gt; The paging of the edition of 1494 ceases with this document, at the end of which is the printer's colophon, reciting that the work was completed on 14 July 1494, at Barcelona, by Pere Posa, priest and printer.&lt;ref name="EB11" /&gt;

The remainder of the volume consists of what may be regarded as an appendix to the original ''Book of the Consulate''. This appendix contains various maritime ordinances of the kings of Aragon and of the councillors of the city of Barcelona, ranging over a period from 1271 to 1493. It is printed apparently in the same type with the preceding part of the volume. The original ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'', coupled with this appendix, circulated in Europe under the title, ''The Consulate of the Sea'', and in the 16th century was translated into the Castilian, the Italian, and the French languages. The Italian translation, printed at Venice c.&amp;nbsp;1549 by [[Jean Baptista Pedrezano]], was the version that obtained the largest circulation in the north of Europe, and led many jurists to suppose the work to have been of Italian origin. In the next century, the work was translated into Dutch by Westerven, and into German by Engelbrecht, and it is also said to have been translated into [[Latin language|Latin]]. An excellent translation into French of ''The Customs of the Sea'', which are the most valuable portion of the ''Book of the Consulate'', was published by [[Jean Marie Pardessus|Pardessus]] in the second volume of his ''Collection des lois maritimes'' (Paris, 1834), under the title of ''La Compilation connue sous le nom do consulat de la mer''. See introduction, by [[Travers Twiss|Sir Travers Twiss]], to the ''[[Black Book of the Admiralty]]'' (London, 1874), which in the appendix to vol.&amp;nbsp;iii, contains his translation of ''The Customs of the Sea'', with the Catalan text.&lt;ref name="EB11" /&gt;--&gt;

The '''Bougainville Civil War''', also known as the '''Bougainville conflict''', was a multi-layered armed conflict fought from 1988 to 1998 in the [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville | North Solomons Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) between PNG and the secessionist forces of the [[Bougainville Revolutionary Army]] (BRA), and between the BRA and other armed groups on Bougainville. The conflict was described by [[John Momis]] as the largest conflict in [[Oceania]] since the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, with an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Bougainvilleans dead.

Hostilities concluded under the Bougainville Peace Agreement in 1998. The national (PNG) government agreed to the founding of the [[Autonomous Bougainville Government]] and to certain rights and authorities which the autonomous government would have over what became known as [[Bougainville Province]], which includes outlying small islands in addition to [[Bougainville Island]] itself.

==Historical background (1930–1988)==
&lt;!--Needs expansion - something about the country and government  --&gt;
Lode gold was first discovered on Bougainville in 1930.{{sfn|Regan|Griffin|2005|p=26}} The discovery of vast [[copper ore]] deposits in the Crown Prince Range on [[Bougainville Island]] during the 1960s led to the establishment of the huge [[Bougainville Copper Mine]] by the Australian company [[Rio Tinto Group|Conzinc Rio Tinto]]. The [[Panguna mine]] began production in 1972 under the management of [[Bougainville Copper Ltd]], with the government of Papua New Guinea as a 20% shareholder. At the time, the Panguna mine was the largest [[open cut mine]] in the world. It produced more than 45% of Papua New Guinea's national export revenue, and was, as such, vitally important to the economy.&lt;ref name=nfsa_background&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins of the Bougainville Conflict|publisher=National Film and Sound Archive of Australia|url=http://dl.nfsa.gov.au/module/357/|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mine recruited thousands of workers to the island, mostly Papua New Guineans, whom the Bougainvilleans referred to as "red-skins" because of their skin colour. By contrast, most native people of the island identify as black. Many "white-skins", mostly Australian nationals, also came to work at the mine. The Bougainvilleans wanted neither the migrants nor immigrants on their land; they especially resented the "red-skins," because of cultural differences between the groups.&lt;ref name=c-r_origins&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Callaghan|first= Mary-Louise|title=The origins of the conflict|publisher=Conciliation Resources|year=2002|url=http://www.c-r.org/accord-article/origins-conflict|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict began to emerge from the start of mining operations at Panguna. Many of the local landowners were opposed to the mine because it attracted an influx of workers from other parts of PNG. In addition, they were concerned about adverse environmental effects, while seeing most of the mine profits leaving the island. Prior to Papua New Guinea's independence in 1975, Bougainville Island had attempted to secede and become independent. Its representatives reached an agreement with the national government for further decentralization, which satisfied concerns at the time.{{sfn|Londey|2004|pp=215–216}}

==Secessionist conflict==
By late 1988 tensions over the mine had led to local violence. The government deployed the [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary]] (RPNGC) Mobile Squads and elements of the [[Papua New Guinea Defence Force]] (PNGDF).{{sfn|Londey|2004|p=216}} Although initially restricted to the area around the mine site, the conflict subsequently intensified.{{sfn|Wehner|Denoon|2001|p=3}} Both sides reported abuses against the native population during fighting between government forces and the rebels of the [[Bougainville Revolutionary Army]] (BRA) and the conflict developed into a general separatist insurgency. The mine company closed the mine, and many non-Bouganvilleans left the island. Fighting continued for a year, during which widespread human rights violations were alleged to have occurred, including the burning of many villages.{{sfn|Londey|2004|p=216}} However, in early 1990 Papua New Guinea withdrew, leaving Bougainville in the control of the BRA.{{sfn|Londey|2004|p=216}} Despite agreeing to disarm and negotiate, [[Francis Ona]], the leader of the BRA, unilaterally declared independence in May 1990.{{sfn|Woodbury|2015|p=6}}{{sfn|Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade|1999|p=23}}

The PNG government subsequently imposed a blockade on Bougainville.{{sfn|Connell|2005|p=297}} It was enforced using [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Iroquois helicopter]]s and [[Pacific-class patrol boat]]s that had been supplied to PNG as aid by the Australian government in the late-1980s as part of a defence co-operation program underway since independence.{{sfn|Wilson|1994|p=32}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nautilus.org/publications/books/australian-forces-abroad/pacific-islands/pacific-patrol-boat-program/|title=Pacific patrol boat program|publisher=Nautilus Institute|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Australian support, as part of its capacity-building effort, included funding for the PNGDF, provision of arms and ammunition, logistics, training, and some specialist and technical advisors and personnel. Similar assistance was also provided to the police.{{sfn|Raath|1991|pp=12–26}}{{refn|During this period Australian Defence Force (ADF) loan personnel filled a number of key positions in the PNGDF on a regular basis, and as a result they were often at least indirectly involved in supporting most PNGDF operations, including those on Bougainville.{{sfn|Raath|1991|p=13}} Five members of the ADF on loan or exchange with the PNGDF are reported to have visited Bougainville during the crisis; however, their duties were restricted to the provision of technical advice.{{sfn|Raath|1991|p=18}}|group=Note}} The helicopters had been provided by Australia without weapons and on the provision that they would not be used for combat; however, the PNGDF subsequently fitted machine-guns in contravention of the agreement and later used them as gunships.{{sfn|Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade|1999|p=23}}{{sfn|Howe|Kiste|1994|p=305}}{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=259–260}}{{refn|The helicopters were reported to have been maintained and operated by a private company contracted to the PNGDF at the time,&lt;ref name=Callick&gt;{{cite news|last=Callick|first=Rowan|title=Battle intensifies over Bougainville copper|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/battle-intensifies-over-bougainville-copper/story-e6frg6z6-1226094940146|newspaper=The Australian|publisher=News Corp Australia|location=Sydney|date=16 July 2011|issn=1038-8761}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were flown by Australian and New Zealand civilian pilots.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|p=30}}|group=Note}} The blockade would remain in effect until the ceasefire in 1994 (although it was informally continued for some parts of Bougainville until 1997).{{sfn|Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade|1999|p=23}}

Ona subsequently set up the Bougainville Interim Government (BIG), appointing himself president. The former premier of the provincial government, [[Joseph Kabui]], was appointed Vice-President.{{sfn|Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade|1999|p=23}} The military commander of the BRA was Sam Kauona, a former PNGDF officer.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=26}} Yet the BIG had little power, and the island began to descend into disarray.{{sfn|Woodbury|2015|p=6}}{{sfn|Londey|2004|p=216}} The command structure set up by the BRA seldom had any real control over the various groups throughout the island that claimed to be part of the BRA.{{sfn|Wehner|Denoon|2001|p=4}}  A number of [[Raskol gangs|''raskol'' (criminal) gangs]] that were affiliated with the BRA, equipped largely with weapons salvaged from the fighting in World War II, terrorized villages, engaging in murder, rape and pillage. Bougainville split into several factions,{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|p=29}} as the conflict took on ethnic and separatist characteristics.{{sfn|Wehner|Denoon|2001|p=3}}

The divisions in the conflict were largely drawn along clan lines. There were 70–80 minor tribal conflicts for BIG to deal with in addition to the blockade.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Keri|title=Bougainville at a crossroads: independence and the mine|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rearvision/bougainville-at-a-crossroads/6514544|date=2 June 2015|work=Rear Vision: Radio National|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the BIG/BRA was dominated by the Nasioi clan, other islanders were suspicious of its goals, especially in north Bougainville.{{sfn|Woodbury|2015|p=6}} On the island of [[Buka Island|Buka]], north of Bougainville, a local militia was formed which succeeded in driving out the BRA in September, with the help of Papuan troops. {{sfn|Wehner|Denoon|2001|p=4}} By the end of 1990, the PNGDF national forces controlled Buka, while the BRA controlled the remainder of Bougainville.{{sfn|Woodbury|2015|p=6}} Early attempts at resolving the conflict resulted in agreements being signed in 1990 and 1991; however, neither side honoured their terms.{{sfn|Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade|1999|p=26}}{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|p=32}} Meanwhile, the BRA leadership of Ona and Kauona fell out with some of the political leaders, such as Kabui.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|p=32}} Several other pro-government village militias, which together became known as the resistance and were armed by the PNGDF, forced the BRA out of their areas.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|pp=32–33}} During 1991–92, the PNGDF gradually returned to Bougainville, taking control of the north and southwest of the main island.{{sfn|Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade|1999|p=25}}

Papua New Guinea's policy towards Bougainville hardened after the defeat of the incumbent government at the 1992 elections. New Prime Minister [[Paias Wingti]] took a considerably more hardline stance.{{sfn|Wehner|Denoon|2001|p=4}} In 1992–93, the PNGDF launched a number of unauthorised cross-border raids into the [[Solomon Islands]] in pursuit of supporters of the BRA. Relations with the Solomon Islands deteriorated, and on one occasion PNG forces clashed with Solomon Island police, exchanging fire. On another the PNGDF troops landed on the island of Oema.{{sfn|May|Selochan|2004|p=172}} The PNGDF, in alliance with the resistance, reoccupied [[Arawa, Papua New Guinea|Arawa]], the provincial capital, in February 1993.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|p=33}} Papuan Foreign Minister [[Julius Chan|Sir Julius Chan]] attempted to gather a peacekeeping force from the nations of the Pacific, but Wingti quashed the idea. He subsequently ordered the army to retake the Panguna mine, and was initially successful. However, his government was short-lived, and in August 1994 was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Julius Chan]].{{sfn|May|1996|}} The assault on Panguna subsequently failed.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=27}} The PNGDF increasingly sustained losses at the hands of the insurgents in the interior of the island, where the jungle limited the visibility and effectiveness of its patrols.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|p=33}}

Chan announced his intention to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, arranging a ceasefire at a meeting with Kauona in the Solomon Islands in September. They agreed to hold a peace conference in Arawa that October, with security provided by an Australian-led [[South Pacific Peacekeeping Force]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/pits/en/treaty_database/1994/18.html Agreement between Papua New Guinea and Fiji, Tonga, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Australia and New Zealand, concerning the status of elements of the defence forces of those countries deployed in the North Solomon's Province of Papua New Guinea as part of the South Pacific Peacekeeping Force (1994) PITSE 18 (28 September 1994) ] ''Pacific Islands Treaty Series'' Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute. A facility of the [[University of the South Pacific]] School of Law&lt;/ref&gt; However, the BIG leaders boycotted the conference, claiming that their safety could not be guaranteed.{{sfn|Londey|2004|pp=216–217}}{{sfn|Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade|1999|pp=27–28}} In the absence of Ona, Kabui and Kauona emerged as more moderate BRA leaders.{{sfn|Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade|1999|p=28}} Chan's government subsequently entered into negotiations with a group of chiefs from the Nasioi clan, headed by Theodore Miriung, a former lawyer for the Panguna Landowners Association. This resulted in the establishment of a Bougainville Transitional Government in April 1995, with its capital in Buka.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|p=38}} Miriung was named as the Premier of a compromise government but ultimately was "unable to bridge the gap between hardliners on both sides".{{sfn|Adams|2001|pp=28–29}}

Meanwhile, Chan was beginning to get frustrated at the lack of progress.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=29}} Following a round of negotiations in [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]], Australia, in September and December 1995, between the BRA, BTG and the PNG government, in January 1996 the BRA/BIG representatives, including Kabui, were fired on by PNGDF forces after returning to Bougainville.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|p=39}} Later, the home of the BIG's representative in the Solomon Islands, Martin Mirori, was firebombed. The BRA subsequently undertook retaliatory action in northern Bougainville and on Buka.{{sfn|Lal|Fortune|2000|p=265}} Chan decided to abandon attempts at peace, and on 21 March 1996, approved the lifting of the ceasefire on Bougainville.{{sfn|Dorney|1998|p=109}} In an address to the nation, he subsequently resolved to achieve a military solution.{{sfn|Lal|Fortune|2000|p=265}}

==Sandline affair==
{{main|Sandline affair}}
With the government of Australia declining to provide direct military support and advocating a political solution to the conflict, Chan began to look elsewhere.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=28}} The [[Sandline affair]] began in March 1996, when the government of Papua New Guinea attempted to hire mercenaries from [[Sandline International]], a London-based [[private military company]], that in turn employed the South African military contractor [[Executive Outcomes]]. As negotiations with Sandline continued,{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|pp=40–43}} in July the PNGDF launched a new offensive on Bougainville. However, the attack failed, suffering from poor logistical planning, a lack of intelligence on BRA locations and mounting casualties.{{sfn|Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade|1999|p=29}}

In September, BRA militants attacked a PNG army camp at Kangu Beach with the help of members of a local militia group, killing twelve PNGDF soldiers and taking five hostage. The incident was the largest single loss in an operation for the PNGDF during the conflict.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|pp=41–42}} The following month, Theodore Miriung was assassinated.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|p=40}} A subsequent independent investigation implicated members of the PNGDF and the resistance militias.{{sfn|Roberts|2002|p=40}}{{sfn|Adams|2001|pp=28–29}} Discipline and morale was rapidly deteriorating within the ranks of the PNG military, and they were withdrawn in August after the offensive ended in a stalemate.{{sfn|Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade|1999|p=29}}{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|p=41}} By this time the PNGDF, with assistance of the Bougainville Resistance Forces, was in "reasonable" control of approximately 40 percent of the island, yet they remained vulnerable to guerilla attacks with the BRA establishing an ascendency over government forces.{{sfn|Aspinall|Jeffrey|Regan|2013|p=122}}

Chan decided that his best chance to recapture the Panguna mine was with the Sandline mercenaries, and a contract was signed in January 1997. However, news of his intention to hire mercenaries was leaked to the Australian press, and international condemnation followed. Although initially supportive, the commander of the PNGDF, [[Jerry Singirok]], then opposed the plan, and ordered all the mercenaries to be detained on arrival. In the resulting saga Papua New Guinea came close to a military coup, with the parliament surrounded by demonstrators and many military personnel. The Australian government placed pressure on PNG to terminate the contract with Sandline, and intercepted the heavy equipment that was being flown-in for the mercenaries. Chan resigned and the mercenaries were removed from Papua New Guinean territory.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|pp=43–44}}

Meanwhile, the conflict continued until 1997.{{sfn|Aspinall|Jeffrey|Regan|2013|p=122}} There were approximately 800 PNGDF and 150 "riot squad" personnel deployed on the island by this time, while the BRF probably numbered around 1,500 men. These men were armed by the PNGDF and operated mostly in a "home guard" role, with only a small number involved in patrolling with the PNGDF or in directly involved in the fighting. BRA strength was estimated at around 2,000 men armed with around 500  modern weapons (mostly captured or bought from PNGDF or "riot squad" personnel) and several thousand World War II vintage or homemade weapons.{{sfn|Londey|2004|p=219}}{{sfn|Wehner|Denoon|2001|p=4}}

==Ceasefire and aftermath==
The impetus for peace was the election of Prime Minister [[Bill Skate]], who had previously opposed a military solution. In mid-1997, talks were held in Honiara and Burnham in New Zealand resulting in a truce, as well as agreement to de-militarize the island. An unarmed Truce Monitoring Group (TMG) led by New Zealand and supported by Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu was subsequently deployed.{{sfn|Londey|2004|pp=219–220}} Since then a ceasefire has largely held on the island. Breaking with Ona, Kauona and Kabui entered into peace talks with the Skate government in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, which culminated in the signing of the Lincoln Agreement in January 1998.{{sfn|Londey|2004|pp=220–222}} Under the terms of the agreement, PNG began to withdraw its soldiers from the island, and steps were taken to disarm the BRA and BRF, while a multinational [[Peace Monitoring Group]] (PMG) under Australian leadership was deployed, replacing the TMG. Legislation to establish a Bougainville Reconciliation Government failed to win approval in the PNG Parliament in December 1998.{{sfn|Wehner|Denoon|2001|pp=10–12}}

A Bougainville provincial government of the same status as the other eighteen provinces of Papua New Guinea, with [[John Momis]] as Governor, was established in January 1999. However, this government was suspended after facing opposition from both the BIA/BRA and BTG. Arrangements were made for the creation of a modified government, to be established in two phases: the first being the Bougainville Constituent Assembly and the second being the elections for the Bougainville People's Congress. Elections were held in May, and Kabui was named president. However, the legality of this was contested by Momis, with the support of a number of tribal chiefs and Resistance leaders. In November, a new body, the Bougainville Interim Provincial Government, was established, headed by Momis. Rapprochment between Kauona and Momis led to an agreement through which the two bodies would act in consultation. An organised reconciliation process began at the tribal level in the early 2000s.{{sfn|Wehner|Denoon|2001|pp=12–14}}

A peace agreement was reached in 2001, leading to a roadmap to the creation of an [[Autonomous Bougainville Government]] (ABG).{{sfn|Woodbury|2015|p=7}} Yet Ona refused to play any part in the peace process, and, with a small minority of fighters, broke away from the BRA.{{sfn|Woodbury|2015|p=6}} Throughout the decade, he continued to resist overtures to participate in the new government, occupying an area around the mine which remained a no-go zone and declaring himself 'king' of Bougainville before dying of malaria in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=Shane|title=Bougainville – The Man Who Would Be King (Transcript)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2005/s1372909.htm|date=17 May 2005|work=Foreign Correspondent|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission|accessdate=9 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043102/http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2005/s1372909.htm#|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Skehan|first=Craig|title=Ona's death paves way for mining to resume |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/onas-death-paves-way-for-mining-to-resume/2005/07/25/1122143784481.html|date=26 July 2005|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elections for the first ABG were held in May and June 2005 with Joseph Kabui elected president.{{sfn|de Matos|Gerster|2009|p=243}}

In March 2006, Dr [[Shaista Shameem]] of the [[United Nations]] working group on mercenaries asked [[Fiji]] and Papua New Guinea for permission to send a team to investigate allegations about the presence of former Fijian soldiers in Bougainville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Bougainville: UN Asks for Invitation to Investigate Mercenaries|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/3886|date=2 March 2006|publisher=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO)|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 it was reported that former PNG Prime Minister Sir [[Michael Somare]] had alleged that Rio Tinto played a role in the civil war by helping finance the actions of the PNG government in Bougainville during the conflict in an attempt to allow the mine to be reopened.&lt;ref name=Callick/&gt; The Bougainville government was given control of mining on the island following the passage of the ''Bougainville Mining Act'' in March 2015; however, the Panguna mine remains closed.&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt; As part of the current peace settlement, a referendum on independence will be held sometime between 2015 and 2020.{{sfn|Woodbury|2015|p=3}}

The war has been described by [[John Momis]], [[President of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville|President]] of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, as the largest conflict in [[Oceania]] since the end of World War II.{{sfn|Woodbury|2015|p=6}} PNGDF casualties during the fighting were believed to include more than 300 killed.{{sfn|Aspinall|Jeffrey|Regan|2013|p=123}} Meanwhile, the Australian government estimated that anywhere between 15,000–20,000 people could have died in the Bougainville conflict. However, more conservative estimates put the number of combat deaths as 1,000–2,000.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2010|pp=86–87}} Other sources estimated that around 10,000 Bougainvilleans died of violence or disease during this period, while over 60,000 Bougainvilleans were living in internally displaced persons' camps by the mid-1990s and thousands more had fled to the nearby Solomon Islands.{{sfn|Woodbury|2015|p=6}}

==Future independence referendum==

A condition of the peace agreement was that a referendum on Bougainville's political status would be held within twenty years. In January 2016 the [[Autonomous Bougainville Government]] and Government of Papua New Guinea agreed to establish the Bougainville Referendum Commission. The Commission is responsible for making preparations for a vote on Bougainville's [[2019 Bougainville Independence Referendum|future political status]], with a draft date of 15 June 2019 set for the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/323054/signing-paves-way-for-bougainville-independence-vote|title=Signing paves way for Bougainville independence vote|date=25 January 2017|website=radionz.co.nz|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dan T. Carter''' is an American [[historian]].

==Life==
He graduated from [[University of South Carolina]], [[University of Wisconsin]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], with a Ph.D. in 1967.
He taught at the [[University of Maryland]], and the [[University of Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc.edu/library/socar/uscs/2003/carter03.html "Coming Home to Carolina",  ''University South Caroliniana Society'']&lt;/ref&gt;
He was Kenan University Professor at [[Emory University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albany.edu/jmmh/vol2no1/Carter1.html Albany.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; and Educational Foundation Professor at [[University of South Carolina]], retiring in 2007.
In 2009, he was the Dow Research Professor at the Roosevelt Center in Middelburg the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.sc.edu/hist/Faculty/carter.html Cas.sc.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of the [[Southern Historical Association]].

In his 1991 [[New York Times]] article, 'The Transformation of a Klansman', regarding the true identity of author [[Asa Earl Carter]] (who wrote as Forrest Carter), Carter suggested that their shared Southern heritage might make the two men distant cousins; this suggestion has subsequently been put forward as fact in later publications.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/04/opinion/the-transformation-of-a-klansman.html?pagewanted=print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20030210060441/http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2001/12/20/carter/print.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Going Native: Indians in the American Cultural Imagination, Shari M.

The '''David Rumsey Historical Map Collection''' is one of the world's largest private [[map collection]]s. It has over 150,000 [[map]]s and [[cartography|cartographic]] items. The collection was created by [[David Rumsey]] who, after making his fortune in [[real estate]], focused initially on collecting 18th- and 19th century maps of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], as this era "saw the rise of modern cartography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/09/27/DDG6K8UNN81.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=David Rumsey made a living in real estate. Then he charted his future to match his passion: maps | first=Jane | last=Ganahl | date=27 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Rumsey has expanded the collection to include maps from the 16th though 21st centuries, and covering the entire world. 

There are now over 82,000 [[digitized]] maps available through his website, http://www.davidrumsey.com, about 1000 of which are currently being hosted through [[Google Earth]] layers. Select maps are also featured at the Rumsey Maps island in [[Second life|Second Life.]] as well as 2D and 3D GIS. A new MapRank search tool has been added enabling geographical searching of about 60,000 maps from the collection by map location and coverage. In addition, a Georeferencer tool has been added that allows site users to georeferenced and display any of the maps in the collection. The website has additional viewers from Luna Imaging, Inc, most popular being the LUNA browser which doesn’t require any special plug-ins or software to view the collection, zoom into image detail, create slide shows, media groups, presentations and more.

The website also has a blog listing new additions to the collection, featured maps, news, videos, and related sites.  

In February 2009, David Rumsey announced that the entire collection would be donated to [[Stanford University]], including 150,000 maps and their [[digital images]], as well as the database used to track the images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2009/february4/oldmaps-020409.html|title=Maps of Americas past|accessdate=7 May 2009 |work=Stanford News Service |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford houses the collection in the new David Rumsey Map Center which opened in the main library in 2016. The [http://www.davidrumsey.com davidrumsey.com] web site (where the images are posted on-line) will continue as a separate public resource.

Certain events that are often circumscribed by social stigma can also cause disenfranchised grief, such as the breakup or loss of a secret relationship (e.g. an [[extramarital affair]]), botched cosmetic surgery procedures, the diagnosis of a [[sexually transmitted infection]], loss of a job, as well as other events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expressivecounseling.com/disenfranchised-grief-alone-ashamed/&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional forms of grief are more widely recognized even in nontraditional living situations. However, there are few support systems, rituals, traditions, or institutions such as [[Grief|bereavement]] [[leave of absence|leave]] available to those experiencing disenfrachised grief.

Even widely recognized forms of grief can become disenfranchised when well-meaning friends and family attempt to set a time limit on a bereaved person's right to grieve. For example, the need to regulate mourning and restore a state of normal work activity severely impacted the grieving process of victims of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], according to American scholar [[Edward Linenthal]]. Grieving for lost children was redefined as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] if parents were not "over it" within two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Linenthal, Edward, ''The Unfinished Bombing, Oklahoma City in American Memory'' (Oxford Univ. Press, 2001), pp. 94-98. {{ISBN|0-19-513672-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loss ==
[[Grief|Loss]] is one of the most common experiences that brings about grieving, and although this is often viewed as [[normality (behavior)|normal]], there are times when it is disqualified. Some examples of when grieving over a loss is disenfranchised include: the loss of a grandchild, of an ex-spouse, of a sibling, or of a child through adoption.

Loss of a grandchild can be extremely difficult for a grandparent, but the grandparent’s grief is often disenfranchised because they are not part of the [[immediate family]]. [[Attention]] and [[Social support|support]] is given to the child’s parents and siblings, but the grandparent’s [[grief]] is two-fold as they have not only grieving the loss of their grandchild, but are also grieving for their adult children who have lost the child. This phenomenon is termed “double-grief” by Davidson &lt;ref name=HannahDavidson&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidson|first1=Hannah|title=A Review of the Literature on Three Types of Disenfranchised Grief: Grandparent Grief, Grief of Birthmothers Following Adoption, and the Grief of Ex-Spouses|url=http://www2.uwstout.edu/content/lib/thesis/2010/2010davidsonh.pdf|website=www.uwstout.edu|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she explains that this makes [[Grief|bereavement]] even more difficult.

Loss of an ex-spouse is disenfranchised due to the lack of a current or ongoing personal relationship between the former couple. Although the marriage has ended, the relationship has not, and there are ties between the two people that will forever be there including: shared children, mutual friendships, and financial connections. Research has shown that those couples who never resolved conflicts after the relationship ended experienced much more grief than those who had.&lt;ref name=HannahDavidson /&gt; The grievers experience guilt and thoughts of “what might have been”, similar to those of widows.&lt;ref name=HannahDavidson /&gt;

Loss of a child by adoption is often disenfranchised because the decision to give a child up for adoption is [[Volunteering|voluntary]], and therefore it is not acceptable by society to grieve. Birth mothers lack support, and are expected to just move on and pretend the child doesn't exist. Many birth mothers experience regret and have thoughts of what might have been or of reuniting with the child.&lt;ref name=HannahDavidson /&gt;

==Relationships==

Many types of relationships are not legitimized by society, therefore when one person in the relationship dies, the other may not have their grief legitimized so it can become disenfranchised.  For example, following the death of a partner in a homosexual relationship societal supports can tend prioritize the immediate family, invalidating the significance of the romantic relationship and loss for the grieving partner (McNutt &amp; Yakushko, 2013)..
Another example may be a former partner, such as the death of an ex-spouse (a person who the griever was previously married to, but eventually divorced).  The death of an ex-spouse does not typically receive the same recognition as the death of a current spouse.  Another type of relationship is one in which the griever and the person who died did not necessarily have a close personal relationship.  This relationship may include coworkers, doctor and nurse relationships with patients, or even people that the griever does not know personally at all, such as celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Janet|last2=Kirshbaum|first2=Marilyn|date=13–26 May 2011|title=Effects of patient death on nursing staff: a literature review|journal=British Journal of Nursing (Mark Allen Publishing)|volume=20|issue=9|pages=559–563|doi=10.12968/bjon.2011.20.9.559|issn=0966-0461|pmid=21647017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relationships formed online are often not recognized or validated by society, for example where friendships are made through online games and social media. However, when one person dies, the griever or person that did not die in the relationship will often experience disenfranchised grief (Doka, 1989).

==Dealing with disenfranchised grief==
There are many models for dealing with grief. The [[Kübler-Ross_model|Kubler-Ross model]] describes grieving in five steps or stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance (Kubler-Ross, 1969).  In other words, in order to begin grieving one must first endorse the loss, and then express emotion.  The griever must then accept the loss and adjust to the change the death or loss caused in his or her life (Cordaro, 2012).  Over the years, however, how grief is conceptualised has moved away from predictable stages that lead to 'recovery' or 'closure', towards an understanding of grief that addresses the complexity and diversity of the grieving experience (Australian Psychological Society, 2016).  Models such as Worden's tasks of grief (2008) and the [[Dual_process_model_of_coping|Dual-Process model]] (Stroebe and Schutt,1999) offer frameworks for dealing with grief in a way that enhances the self awareness of the grieving person (Australian Psychological Society, 2016).

Disenfranchised grief presents some complications that are not always present in other grieving processes.  Firstly, there are usually intensified reactions to death or loss.  For example, the griever may become more depressed or angry due to not being able to fully express his or her grief.  Secondly, disenfranchised grief means society does not recognize the death or loss; therefore, the griever does not receive strong social support and may be isolated. As disenfranchised grief is not legitimized by others, the bereaved person may be denied access to rituals, ceremonies, or the right to express their thoughts and emotions  (McKissock &amp; McKissock, 1998). When supporting someone through disenfranchised grief it is important to acknowledge and validate their loss and grief (McKissock &amp; McKissock, 1998).

'''Driving into Walls''' (2012) is a play written by [[Suzie Miller]] and produced by [[Barking Gecko Theatre Company]].

==Development==
Miller and director [[John Sheedy (director)|John Sheedy]] interviewed over 500 Western Australian teens for the play, asking about their day-to-day lives and drawing from that many of the stories of the play.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Laurie |first=Victoria |url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/02/27/3440687.htm |title=Driving into Walls - ABC Perth - Australian Broadcasting Corporation |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2012-02-27 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/-/entertainment/13037411/theatre-review-driving-into-walls/ |title=Theatre Review: Driving into Walls - The West Australian |publisher=Au.news.yahoo.com |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/creative-educating-for-the-future/story-e6frg8n6-1226205351727 |title=Creative educating for the future |last=Laurie |first=Victoria |publisher=''The Australian'' |date=November 25, 2011 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The plot of the story focuses on five teenagers and their online and offline relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/giving-voice-to-the-exploited-and-unleashing-the-child-within/story-e6frg8n6-1226285512087 |title=Giving voice to the exploited and unleashing the child within |last=Laurie |first=Victoria |publisher=''The Australian'' |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story does not follow a linear narrative and is more a collection of short stories with a shared message than one complete story.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

==Performances==
[[File:During a performance of Driving into Walls.jpg|thumb|Dress rehearsal, February 2012.]]
Under the direction of [[John Sheedy (director)|John Sheedy]], the show was first performed as part of the 2012 [[Perth International Arts Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianstage.com.au/201202275192/reviews/piaf/driving-into-walls-%7c-barking-gecko-theatre-company.html |title=Driving Into Walls &amp;#124; Barking Gecko Theatre Company |publisher=Australianstage.com.au |date=2012-02-27 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later performed in the [[State Theatre Centre of Western Australia]] in the Underground studio.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51928">The use of [[psychoactive substance]]s is one of the most perplexing human behaviors. [[Psychoactive drug]]s can relieve the symptoms of [[mental disorder]]s (e.g. [[lithium]]) or cause harm to individuals and societies (e.g. [[heroin]]). Psychoactive drugs can induce pleasure, increase energy (e.g. [[chocolate]], [[coffee]]), relieve pain ([[Aspirin]]), or can impose a large [[social burden]] in the form of chronic illness (e.g. [[tobacco]]) and be a cause of mortality.

Why do humans seek out and at times even develop addictions to drugs that harm them? A number of attempts have been made to understand drug use and addiction from an evolutionary perspective. '''Evolutionary models of drug use''' are unique in that they emphasize the effect drugs had on [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] over human evolution.

== Hijack hypothesis ==

The dominant paradigm of drug abuse focuses on human [[neurobiology]] and suggests that drug use is the result of reward-related behavior and that [[drug addiction]] is a consequence of drug interference with [[natural reward system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wise|first1=Roy A|title=Addiction Becomes a Brain Disease|journal=Neuron|date=April 2000|volume=26|issue=1|pages=27–33|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)81134-4|pmid=10798389|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(00)81134-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, this tradition postulates that the chemical compounds humans seek out increase brain dopamine levels and thereby effectively usurp [[Mesolimbic pathway|the mesolimbic pathway,]] a system originally intended to motivate/reward fitness enhancing behaviors such as those that increase access to food and sex.&lt;ref name="Neuronal Reward 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz|first1=Wolfram|title=Potential Vulnerabilities of Neuronal Reward, Risk, and Decision Mechanisms to Addictive Drugs|journal=Neuron|date=February 2011|volume=69|issue=4|pages=603–617|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2011.02.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
Ideas concerning the neural bases of motivation and reinforcement in behavior can be traced back to the 1950s. In 1953, Olds and Milner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milner|first=Peter M.|title=Brain-stimulation reward: A review.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/h0084275|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology/Revue canadienne de psychologie|volume=45|issue=1|pages=1–36|doi=10.1037/h0084275}}&lt;/ref&gt; published findings implicating a brain region, specifically a cluster of [[Dopamine|dopamine neurons]], with reward-based learning. Drugs of abuse were later discovered to increase dopamine in the region of the brain associated with reward-based-learning (see: [[brain stimulation reward]]).

=== Proximate Mechanisms ===

==== Molecular Pathways ====
Research on the molecular pathways of addiction suggests that drugs of abuse, despite their diverse chemical substrates, converge on a common circuitry in the brain’s limbic system. Specifically, drugs are thought to activate the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic dopamine pathway]], facilitating dopamine transmission in the [[nucleus accumbens]], via disinhibition, excitation, uptake blockade, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hagen|first=E.H.|last2=Sullivan|first2=R.J.|last3=Schmidt|first3=R.|last4=Morris|first4=G.|last5=Kempter|first5=R.|last6=Hammerstein|first6=P.|title=Ecology and neurobiology of toxin avoidance and the paradox of drug reward|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306452209001729|journal=Neuroscience|volume=160|issue=1|pages=69–84|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.01.077}}&lt;/ref&gt; to produce a dopamine-like, yet dopamine independent effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nestler|first=Eric J|title=Is there a common molecular pathway for addiction?|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nn1578|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=11|pages=1445–1449|doi=10.1038/nn1578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Emotional Pathways ====
The hijack model of drug abuse explains that drugs that elicit positive emotion mediate incentive motivation in the [[nucleus accumbens]] of the brain. Put another way, drugs of abuse act on ancient and evolutionarily conserved neural mechanisms associated with positive emotions that evolved to mediate incentive behavior.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|date=3 October 1997|title=Psychoactive Drug Use in Evolutionary Perspective|journal=Science|volume=278|issue=5335|pages=63–66|doi=10.1126/science.278.5335.63|last1=Nesse|first1=R. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lende|first1=Daniel H.|last2=Smith|first2=E. O.|title=Evolution meets biopsychosociality: an analysis of addictive behavior|journal=Addiction|date=April 2002|volume=97|issue=4|pages=447–458|doi=10.1046/j.1360-0443.2002.00022.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychoactive drug]]s induce emotions that in human evolutionary history signaled increases in [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durrant|first1=Russil|last2=Adamson|first2=Simon|last3=Todd|first3=Fraser|last4=Sellman|first4=Doug|title=Drug use and addiction: evolutionary perspective|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|date=13 November 2009|volume=43|issue=11|pages=1049–1056|doi=10.3109/00048670903270449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive emotions such as [[euphoria]] and excitation are tools chosen by natural selection to help direct the behavior and physiology of an individual towards an increase in [[Darwinian fitness]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="saah"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saah|first1=Tammy|title=The evolutionary origins and significance of drug addiction|journal=Harm Reduction Journal|date=2005|volume=2|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1186/1477-7517-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the environment of evolutionary adaptation, humans would feel positive euphoric emotions in response to a successful foraging session or in the event of a successful breeding. Many psychoactive substances provide this same feeling and yet do not produce fitness benefits.

===== Example: Alcohol =====
Researchers&lt;ref name="saah" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Frone|first2=Michael R.|last3=Russell|first3=Marcia|last4=Mudar|first4=Pamela|year=1995|title=Drinking to regulate positive and negative emotions: A motivational model of alcohol use|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.990|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=69|issue=5|pages=990–1005|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.990|pmid=7473043|last1=Cooper|first1=M. Lynne}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown how emotional disposition is correlated with problematic use of alcohol, wherein if the reason for alcohol consumption is positive, the user is thought to drink to enhance positive feelings with greater control of the substance than if the user’s emotional disposition prior to alcoholic consumption was negative. In these cases, the individual is drinking to cope and is shown to have less control over his/her own use. Alcohol mediates negative feelings by their suppression but also encourages the habituated continuance of positive emotion. Recovering alcoholics often report that the reason for relapse is often related to the impulse to compensate for negative feelings, resulting in a motivation to cope and therefore drink.

=== Evolutionary Mismatch ===
Despite being harmful, drugs such as [[nicotine]], [[cocaine]], [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], THC, and [[opium]] artificially stimulate the emotions and neural circuits involved in the [[mesolimbic reward system]] thus encouraging [[Recreational drug use|drug consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/22/9/3306.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs of abuse are harmful, why do they  increase dopamine like sugar and sex do? The hijack hypothesis suggests that drugs are effective hijackers of neural reward circuitry (e.g. the mesolimbic dopamine system) because they are [[Evolutionary mismatch|evolutionarily novel]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Specifically proposing that modern-day drug concentrations, methods of delivery, and the existence of certain drugs themselves were not available until recently on an evolutionary time scale, and thus human biology has been slow to adapt and is presently mismatched and susceptible.

To explain how drugs increase dopamine and cause positive emotions while at the same time lowering reproductive fitness, researchers posited that evolutionarily novel drugs hijack the brain’s mesolimbic dopamine system and generate a false positive signal of a fitness benefit as well as inhibiting negative effects, to signal a lack of negative fitness consequences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=R. J|last2=Hagen|first2=E. H|last3=Hammerstein|first3=P.|title=Revealing the paradox of drug reward in human evolution|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 June 2008|volume=275|issue=1640|pages=1231–1241|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1673|pmc=2367444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern drug addiction fundamentally indicates a false increase of fitness, leading to increasing drug abuse to continue gain, even if the gain is realized as being false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eosmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Smith-Evolution-Substance-Abuse.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; That these drugs create a signal in the brain that indicates, falsely, the arrival of a huge fitness benefit which changes behavioral propensities so that drug seeking increases in frequency and displaces adaptive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/22/9/3306.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the hijack hypothesis suggest that the paradox of drug reward is due to this [[evolutionary mismatch]], that extant access to psychoactive drug concentrations and products are unmatched by those that existed in the past.

== The paradox of drug reward ==

Why do humans seek out and consume drugs that harm them? The paradox of drug reward refers to the puzzling ability of drugs to induce both aversive and rewarding effects.&lt;ref name="Sullivan 1231–1241"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Roger J.|last2=Hagen|first2=Edward H.|last3=Hammerstein|first3=Peter|date=2008-06-07|title=Revealing the paradox of drug reward in human evolution|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1640/1231|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=275|issue=1640|pages=1231–1241|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1673|issn=0962-8452|pmc=2367444|pmid=18353749}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite contention on the particulars of dopamine induced reward and behavior, there is agreement that dopamine plays an instrumental role in the processing of reward-related stimuli and that drug induced dopamine stimulation explains at least some part of drug abuse phenomena. And still, almost all major recreational drugs are plant [[secondary metabolite]]s or a close chemical analog.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007" /&gt; The secondary plant compounds from which psychoactive drugs are derived are a form of interspecies defense chemicals that evolved to deter and/or mitigate consumption of the plant soma by [[herbivore]]s/insects. The compounds from which psychoactive drugs are derived evolved to punish herbivore consumption, not reward it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Tony|last2=Amit|first2=Zalman|date=1987-01-01|title=Conditioned taste aversion induced by self-administered drugs: Paradox revisited|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763487800052|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=11|issue=1|pages=107–130|doi=10.1016/S0149-7634(87)80005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human-Plant Coevolutionary History ===
Animals evolved to exploit plant tissues and energy stores and in response plants developed a number of defenses, including neurotoxins. The presence and concentration of these toxins vary by plant tissue, with leaves and organs central to reproduction and energy conservation displaying high toxin concentrations (e.g. pistils/stamens and storage organs) and absent in tissue central to seed dispersion (e.g. fruit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plant-animal interactions : an evolutionary approach|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell Science|isbn=978-0-632-05267-7|edition=4. [print.].|location=Oxford [u.a.]|last1=Pellmyr|first1=ed. by Carlos M. Herrera; Olle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power and effectiveness of plant neurotoxic substances has been shaped by ~400 million years of evolution.&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013" /&gt; Plant derived neurotoxins are not evolutionarily novel and human neurophysiology recognizes plant toxins and activates specialized xenobiotic defenses that involve genes, tissue barriers, neural circuits, organ systems and behaviors to protect against them.&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013" /&gt;

==== Herbivore Defense Mechanisms ====
Drug toxicity and aversion exist in humans and are at odds with the theory of drug reward. Chronic drug use is harmful in humans and the human brain has evolved defenses to prevent, not reinforce, drug abuse. In response to the evolution of plant chemical defenses, [[Herbivore adaptations to plant defense|herbivores have co-evolved a number of countermeasures]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Agrawal|first2=Anurag A.|date=November 2002|title=Herbivore Offense|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=33|issue=1|pages=641–664|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150443|last1=Karban|first1=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; including (1) compounds that prevent or attenuate induction of plant chemical defenses; (2) detoxification mechanisms, including enzymes and symbiotic relationships with microbes to detoxify or extract nutrients from plant defenses, and cellular membrane carrier proteins for toxin transport; and (3) chemosensors and aversive learning mechanisms that permit selective feeding on less toxic tissues.

==== Human Defense Mechanisms ====
Human and plant neurotoxin coevolution is evidenced by features of the [[xenobiotic]] defense network. Tobacco activates defense mechanisms which researchers suggests it is recognized as toxic not a reward.

In addition, research has found genetic evidence that humans have had a long evolutionary history to plant neurotoxins. Sullivan et al. (2008)&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007" /&gt; has noted that humans, like other mammals, have ‘inherited’ the cytochrome P450 system, which functions to detoxify chemicals found in the environment, including plant neurotoxins. The ubiquity of CYP genes in humans worldwide, including CYP2A6 and CYP2B6, which metabolize nicotine, as well as other drugs, might suggest an evolutionary history with humans and plant neurotoxins.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007" /&gt; The mammalian body has also evolved to develop defenses against overtoxicity, such as e[[Drug metabolism|xogenous substance metabolism]] and vomiting reflexes.&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013" /&gt;

== Neurotoxin regulation hypothesis ==

The [[neurotoxin]] regulation model of human drug use proposes that during the course of human evolution, plant consumption played a key role. The hypothesis suggests that the compulsory consumption of both the nutrients and neurotoxins in plants selected for a system capable of maximizing the benefits of plant energy extraction while mitigating the cost of plant toxicity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hagen|first1=E.H.|last2=Sullivan|first2=R.J.|last3=Schmidt|first3=R.|last4=Morris|first4=G.|last5=Kempter|first5=R.|last6=Hammerstein|first6=P.|title=Ecology and neurobiology of toxin avoidance and the paradox of drug reward|journal=Neuroscience|date=April 2009|volume=160|issue=1|pages=69–84|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.01.077|pmid=19233250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007"/&gt; To do this, humans evolved a defense system in which plant consumption is mediated by cues of toxicity in a manner sensitive to the individual’s toxicity threshold, maintaining blood toxin concentrations below a critical level.&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hagen|first1=Edward H.|last2=Roulette|first2=Casey J.|last3=Sullivan|first3=Roger J.|title=Explaining Human Recreational Use of ‘pesticides’: The Neurotoxin Regulation Model of Substance Use vs. the Hijack Model and Implications for Age and Sex Differences in Drug Consumption|journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry|date=2013|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evidence for Toxin Regulation ===
Research on herbivores supports the notion of a regulation pathway. Plant toxin concentration informs mammalian herbivore food choices, with herbivores moderating toxicity by capping daily plant intake to accommodate blood toxin concentrations. This mechanism exists across herbivore species and remains static in response to a range of plant toxins, even those that are evolutionarily novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Torregrossa|first1=Ann-Marie|last2=Dearing|first2=M. Denise|title=Nutritional toxicology of mammals: regulated intake of plant secondary compounds|journal=Functional Ecology|date=February 2009|volume=23|issue=1|pages=48–56|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01523.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in laboratory conditions, mice have been shown to moderate administration of drugs regardless of dose per injection or the number of lever presses required.&lt;ref name="Sugar addiction"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahmed|first1=Serge H.|last2=Guillem|first2=Karine|last3=Vandaele|first3=Youna|title=Sugar addiction|journal=Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care|date=July 2013|volume=16|issue=4|pages=434–439|doi=10.1097/MCO.0b013e328361c8b8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Example: Nicotine ====
Evidence of toxin regulation exists across drug types and is present in the case of [[nicotine]]. In humans, self-administration of nicotine is moderated such that steady blood concentrations of the toxin are maintained.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Caroline|title=Evolutionary and neuropsychological perspectives on addictive behaviors and addictive substances: relevance to the &amp;quot;food addiction&amp;quot; construct|journal=Substance Abuse and Rehabilitation|date=December 2014|pages=129|doi=10.2147/SAR.S56835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013"/&gt; Moreover, though nicotine is a potent neurotoxin, lethal overdoses are rare and smoking behavior is couched around titration, with number of cigarettes smoked directly tied to changes in nicotine blood concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scherer|first1=Gerhard|title=Smoking behaviour and compensation: a review of the literature|journal=Psychopharmacology|date=5 July 1999|volume=145|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1007/s002130051027|pmid=10445368}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, although typical doses of recreational drugs are often only marginally below the lethal dose, overdose remains rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gable|first1=Robert S.|title=Comparison of acute lethal toxicity of commonly abused psychoactive substances|journal=Addiction|date=June 2004|volume=99|issue=6|pages=686–696|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00744.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, drug consumption is metered. Thus, proponents of the neurotoxin regulation model of drug use suggest it is highly unlikely that toxin consumption is controlled by the system that motivates and rewards the consumption of [[macronutrients]]. Arguing that If drugs and sugar (and other energetically dense foods) stimulate dopamine in the mesolimbic reward system with the same degree of efficiency, then, the drug overdose rates should be comparable in scale to the incidence of obesity.

=== Evidence of human brain and plant neurotoxin coevolution ===
The neurotoxin regulation hypothesis proposes that drug use is not novel because human brains and plant neurotoxins [[Coevolution|coevolved]]. Genetic evidence suggests that humans have had regular exposure to plant drugs throughout our evolutionary history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1673|title=Revealing the paradox of drug reward in human evolution|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=275|issue=1640|pages=1231|year=2008|last1=Sullivan|first1=R. J|last2=Hagen|first2=E. H|last3=Hammerstein|first3=P.|pmc=2367444}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaeology|Archeological]] evidence indicates the presence of psychoactive plants and drug use in early hominid species about 200 million years ago.&lt;ref name=saah/&gt; [[Paleogenetics|Paleogenetic]] evidence suggests that the first time human ancestors were exposed and adapted to substantial amount of dietary ethanol, was approximately 10 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrigan|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Uryasev|first2=Oleg|last3=Frye|first3=Carole B.|last4=Eckman|first4=Blair L.|last5=Myers|first5=Candace R.|last6=Hurley|first6=Thomas D.|last7=Benner|first7=Steven A.|title=Hominids adapted to metabolize ethanol long before human-directed fermentation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=13 January 2015|volume=112|issue=2|pages=458–463|doi=10.1073/pnas.1404167111|bibcode=2015PNAS..112..458C|pmc=4299227}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neurobiological]] evidence appears to corroborate this story. The fit of [[allelochemicals]] within the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] indicates some coevolutionary activity between mammalian brains and psychoactive plants, meaning they interacted ecologically and therefore responded to one another evolutionarily.&lt;ref name=saah/&gt; This would have only been possible with mammalian [[Central nervous system|CNS]] exposure to these allelochemicals, therefore to ancient mammalian psychotropic substance use. For example, the mammalian brain has evolved receptor systems for plant substances, such as the opioid receptor system, not available to the mammalian body itself.

=== Neurotoxin regulation hypothesis versus hijiack hypothesis ===
The neurotoxin regulation model of drug use is a response to proponents of the hijack hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007"/&gt; Largely this is because the neurobiological reward model of drug use sees interactions between plant neurotoxins and human reward systems as novel and rewarding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuronal Reward 2011"/&gt;

The neurotoxin regulation hypothesis emphasizes the [[evolutionary biology]] of plant-human coevolution and maintains that [[Secondary metabolite|secondary plant metabolites]], including [[alkaloid]]s like nicotine, morphine, and cocaine, are potent [[neurotoxin]]s that evolved to deter and punish herbivore consumption of the plant soma not encourage/reward it. Researchers highlight that it is evolutionarily disadvantageous for plants to produce toxins that plant predators (e.g. humans) are attracted to, and that it runs contrary to evolutionary logic that plant predators (e.g. humans) would evolve neurobiological systems unprotected from plant toxin consumption.&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Proponents of the hijack hypothesis outline a path to addiction that involves drugs co-opting neural reward systems intended for food. However, research on murine models has shown that when the concentration is sufficiently high, sugar operates as a more robust reward than even [[cocaine]]. In laboratory conditions, where rats are presented with both a sugar and cocaine sipper, they choose sugar.&lt;ref name="Sugar addiction" /&gt; Researchers use&lt;ref name="Sugar addiction" /&gt; these findings to suggest that sugar reward might generate a stronger dopamine stimulation than cocaine and also may make use of neural mechanisms beyond dopamine stimulation.

Alternative mechanisms explain continued tobacco use: The majority of first time users of cigarettes report adverse reactions, including nausea, dizziness, sickness, and headache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eissenberg|first1=Thomas|last2=Balster|first2=Robert L|title=Initial tobacco use episodes in children and adolescents: current knowledge, future directions|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|date=May 2000|volume=59|pages=41–60|doi=10.1016/S0376-8716(99)00164-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by DiFranza et al. (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiFranza|first1=Joseph R.|last2=Savageau|first2=Judith A.|last3=Fletcher|first3=Kenneth|last4=Ockene|first4=Judith K.|last5=Rigotti|first5=Nancy A.|last6=McNeill|first6=Ann D.|last7=Coleman|first7=Mardia|last8=Wood|first8=Constance|title=Recollections and repercussions of the first inhaled cigarette|journal=Addictive Behaviors|date=February 2004|volume=29|issue=2|pages=261–272|doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2003.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 69% of subjects rated inhaling their first cigarette as bad, and nearly three-quarters (72%) reported that their first cigarette made them not want to smoke again. Given the above, opponents of the reward model of drug use suggest it is likely that a mechanism other than a false perception of an increased fitness benefit via hijacking of the brain’s [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic dopamine system]], is leading to continued tobacco use.

== Pharmacophagy hypothesis ==

Throughout the course of [[human evolution]], the importance of [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive plant substances]] for health has been enormous. Since our earliest ancestors chewed on certain herbs to relieve pain, or wrapped leaves around wounds to improve healing, natural products have often been the only ways of treating disease and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ji|first1=Hong-Fang|last2=Li|first2=Xue-Juan|last3=Zhang|first3=Hong-Yu|title=Natural products and drug discovery. Can thousands of years of ancient medical knowledge lead us to new and powerful drug combinations in the fight against cancer and dementia?|journal=EMBO Reports|date=20 February 2009|volume=10|issue=3|pages=194–200|doi=10.1038/embor.2009.12|pmid=19229284|pmc=2658564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants provide fitness benefits. Upwards of 25% of all pharmaceutical drugs are from plant-derived sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maridass|first1=M|title=Origins of plant derived medicines|journal=Ethnobotanical Leaflets|date=2008|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1078&amp;context=ebl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US National Cancer Institute has identified over 3,000 plants that are effective against cancer cells. Almost all major recreational drugs are [[Secondary metabolite|secondary plant compounds]] or a close chemical analog.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007"/&gt; It is well established that in both present and past contexts plants have been used for medicinal purposes.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007"/&gt;

A core premise of [[Evolution|evolutionary theory]] is that a trait cannot evolve unless it contributes to an individual’s reproductive fitness. Proponents of the pharmacophagy hypothesis/medicinal model of drug use suggest that pharmacophagy, the consumption of pharmacological substances for medicinal purposes, evolved in the backdrop of human-plant coevolution as a means of self-medication. Theorists propose that the reason humans learned to ignore the cues of plant toxicity (e.g. bitter taste) and consumed potentially lethal substances with little to no energetic content because ingesting the bioactive compounds of plants in small amounts was therapeutic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013"/&gt;

Though the long-term health costs of drug use are undeniable, proponents of the medicinal model of drug use suggest it is possible that regulated consumption of plant neurotoxins was selected for. In this regard, researchers have argued that the human brain evolved to control and regulate intake of psychoactive plant toxins in order to promote [[Fitness (biology)|reproductive fitness]]. Broadly, theorists suggest that plant toxins were deliberately ingested by human ancestors to combat [[macroparasite]]s (e.g. parasitic worms) and/or to ward off disease carrying vectors (e.g. mosquitos).

=== Nicotine as an anthelminthic ===
For example, researchers have recently sought to understand why humans began using tobacco in spite of the consequences and adverse reactions commonly associated with its use. Hagen and colleagues&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; propose that, as in other species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=I. T.|title=An Ecologically Motivated Analysis of Plant-Herbivore Interactions in Native Tobacco|journal=Plant Physiology|date=1 December 2001|volume=127|issue=4|pages=1449–1458|doi=10.1104/pp.010762}}&lt;/ref&gt; humans began using tobacco and other plant toxins as a way of controlling infection by parasitic diseases, including [[helminths]]. Tobacco, as well as arecoline and cannabis, two other plant neurotoxins that are widely used as recreational drugs in humans, have been found to be toxic to parasitic worms that affect humans and other mammals, as well as plants.&lt;ref name="Casey J 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roulette|first1=Casey J.|last2=Mann|first2=Hayley|last3=Kemp|first3=Brian M.|last4=Remiker|first4=Mark|last5=Roulette|first5=Jennifer W.|last6=Hewlett|first6=Barry S.|last7=Kazanji|first7=Mirdad|last8=Breurec|first8=Sébastien|last9=Monchy|first9=Didier|last10=Sullivan|first10=Roger J.|last11=Hagen|first11=Edward H.|title=Tobacco use vs. helminths in Congo basin hunter-gatherers: self-medication in humans?|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=September 2014|volume=35|issue=5|pages=397–407|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern anthelminthics function as well by targeting [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s (nAChRs) on [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] muscle cells of parasites, producing paralysis and expelling the parasite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Köhler|first1=Peter|title=The biochemical basis of anthelmintic action and resistance|journal=International Journal for Parasitology|date=April 2001|volume=31|issue=4|pages=336–345|doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(01)00131-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same receptors which are targeted by nicotine (Roulette et al., 2014). Moreover, it has also been found that nicotine is equally or more effective than commercial anthelmintics at killing leeches, including those that infect humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bahmani|first1=Mahmoud|last2=Farkhondeh|first2=Tahereh|last3=Sadighara|first3=Parisa|title=The anti-parasitic effects of Nicotina tabacum on leeches|journal=Comparative Clinical Pathology|date=27 January 2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=357–359|doi=10.1007/s00580-012-1413-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Roulette et al. (2014)&lt;ref name="Casey J 2014"/&gt; found in a study comparing male smoking prevalence and parasite load among Aka [[hunter-gatherer]]s that treatment with commercial anthelmintics was associated with a decrease in [[cotinine]] concentrations (a measure of current tobacco use), thereby supporting their theory that humans regulate the amount of tobacco used in response to current helminth infection. The study also found that men with higher initial tobacco use also had lower worm burdens one year later, suggesting that nicotine not only eliminates parasites, but also protects from reinfection.

== Sexual selection hypothesis ==

Some evolutionary psychological theories concerning drug use suggest individuals consume drugs to increase reproductive opportunities. Drug use can increase reproductive fitness because drug use can (1) advertise biological quality, sexual maturity, or availability, (2) decrease inhibitions in mating contexts, and/or (3) enhance associative learning behaviors that in turn increase mating opportunities. See Richardson et al., 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=George B.|last2=Chen|first2=Ching-Chen|last3=Dai|first3=Chia-Liang|last4=Swoboda|first4=Christopher M.|last5=Nedelec|first5=Joseph L.|last6=Chen|first6=Wei-Wen|title=Substance use and mating success|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=January 2017|volume=38|issue=1|pages=48–57|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2016.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a review.

=== Costly Signaling ===

==== Advertising biological quality ====
Researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polderman|first1=Tinca J C|last2=Benyamin|first2=Beben|last3=de Leeuw|first3=Christiaan A|last4=Sullivan|first4=Patrick F|last5=van Bochoven|first5=Arjen|last6=Visscher|first6=Peter M|last7=Posthuma|first7=Danielle|title=Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies|journal=Nature Genetics|date=18 May 2015|volume=47|issue=7|pages=702–709|doi=10.1038/ng.3285}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that because variation in drug use susceptibility is in part due to genetic factors, drug consumption could potentially be a costly and [[Signalling theory|honest signal]] of biological quality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borkowska|first1=Barbara|last2=Pawlowski|first2=Boguslaw|title=Recreational Drug Use and Fluctuating Asymmetry: Testing the Handicap Principle|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|date=October 2014|volume=12|issue=4|pages=147470491401200|doi=10.1177/147470491401200407}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zahavi|first=Amotz|title=Mate selection—A selection for a handicap|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022519375901113|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=53|issue=1|pages=205–214|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis being that humans engage in substance use despite health costs in part to evidence that they can afford to do so. To test the effects substance use had on indicators of mating success researchers tested the effect an individual’s [[fluctuating asymmetry]] had on the propensity/likelihood to use drugs and found no significant results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Advertising sexual maturity ====
Hagen et al. (2013)&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013"/&gt; suggest that individuals use drug substances to signal maturity. They point out that sexually selected cues of quality often emerge in adolescence (e.g. the peacock’s tail) and reliably signal developmental maturity. The [[Teratology|teratogenic]] effects of drugs of abuse are well documented, as is the fact that psychoactive substances are most harmful for individuals who are developmentally immature. Although this hypothesis remains untested, evidence in support comes from age at onset of drug use. Unequivocally, tobacco consumption does not occur prior to age 11 and in most all cases, this aligns with age at onset of drug use, as cigarette addicts report having first smoked in adolescence. Hagen et al. suggest the reason drug use most often occurs in adolescent populations is due to the developmental maturity of the adolescent nervous system as well as the increases competition to compete for mates. Consistent with these notions, researchers have found that adolescents with alcohol use disorders were more sexually active, had more sexual partners, and initiated sexual activity at slightly albeit younger ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=Susan L|last2=Pollock|first2=Nancy K|last3=Martin|first3=Christopher S|last4=Lynch|first4=Kevin G|title=Risky sexual behaviors among adolescents with alcohol use disorders|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|date=September 1999|volume=25|issue=3|pages=179–181|doi=10.1016/S1054-139X(99)00023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decreasing inhibitions ===
Another possible explanation to the prevalence of substance use is that it contributes to mating success by altering brain functions that lower inhibitions. Generally, people seem to believe substance use will enhance their social behaviors in ways conducive to mating success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fromme|first1=Kim|last2=Stroot|first2=Elizabeth A.|last3=Kaplan|first3=David|title=Comprehensive effects of alcohol: Development and psychometric assessment of a new expectancy questionnaire.|journal=Psychological Assessment|date=1993|volume=5|issue=1|pages=19–26|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.5.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that many drug types inhibit prefrontal cortex neural activity, the area of the brain responsible conducting long term gains and short term costs.

== Evolutionary Approaches to Age and Sex Differences in Drug Use ==
Drug use is not evenly distributed in the population.

=== Sex differences ===
[[Life history theory|Life history]] predicts that men, especially if they are young, are most likely to engage in drug use because they are most likely to engage in risky behavior and discount the future. Young men have the most to gain from risk-taking behavior because competition for mates, status, and resources is greatest during late adolescence and young adulthood. As men age, they are more likely to develop long-term [[Pair bond|pair-bonds]], accrue status, and have children, thus as men age life history theory predicts a decrease in risk taking behavior and a reallocation of energy to parenting rather than mating. Average age at drug initiation, occurs in adolescence (ages 15–25) and supports this shift. In contrast, life history theory predicts that women are less prone to engage in risk-taking behavior because they experience less variance in reproductive success and have more to lose from risk taking and more to gain from focusing effort on parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rose|first=Michael R.|last2=Mueller|first2=Laurence D.|date=1993-03-01|title=Stearns, Stephen C., 1992.

==== ''The fetal protection hypothesis:'' ====
Almost all major recreational drugs are secondary plant compounds or a close chemical analog &lt;ref name="Sullivan 1231–1241"/&gt; and are thus teratogenic, substances known to cause congenital abnormalities and other reproductive harms (e.g. nicotine, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide). Give sex-specific vulnerabilities and fitness costs, the fetal protection hypothesis proposes that selection for increased drug avoidance could have evolved in women to protect them from harming their developing fetuses and nursing infants.&lt;ref name="Hagen"/&gt;

'''Ancestral Women and Conditions''': In the [[Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment of evolutionary adaptation]] (EEA), selection pressures shaping avoidance of or defenses against teratogenic substances would have been high.

'''Exploration''' is the act of [[wikt:search|searching]] for the purpose of discovery of [[information]] or resources. Exploration occurs in all [[Sessility (zoology)|non-sessile]] animal species, including humans. In human [[history]], its most dramatic rise was during the [[Age of Discovery]] when [[European peoples|European]] explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons. Since then, [[major explorations after the Age of Discovery]] have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery.

In [[scientific research]], exploration is one of three purposes of empirical research (the other two being description and [[explanation]]). The term is often used metaphorically. For example, an individual may speak of exploring the Internet, sexuality, etc.&lt;!-- How are these metaphors? They fit the definition - searching for the discovery of information. --&gt;

==Notable periods of human exploration==

===Phoenician galley sailings===
The [[Phoenicia]]ns (1550 BCE–300 BCE) traded throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Asia Minor]] though many of their routes are still unknown today. The presence of tin in some Phoenician artifacts suggests that they may have traveled to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. According to Virgil's [[Aeneid]] and other ancient sources, the legendary Queen [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] was a Phoenician from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] who sailed to [[North Africa]] and founded the city of Carthage.

===Carthaginean exploration of Western Africa===
[[Hanno the Navigator]] (500 BC), a [[Carthage|Carthaginean]] navigator explored the Western Coast of [[Africa]].

===Greek &amp; Roman exploration of Northern Europe and Thule===
* The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] explorer from [[Marseille]], [[Pytheas]] (380 – ''c.'' 310 BC) was the first to circumnavigate [[Great Britain]], explore [[Germany]], and reach ''[[Thule]]'' (most commonly thought to be the [[Shetland Islands]] or [[Iceland]]).
* Romans -under [[Augustus]] emperor- reached and explored all the [[Baltic Sea]]

===Roman explorations ===
;Africa Exploration
The Romans organized expeditions to cross the [[Sahara]] desert with five different routes:

*through the western Sahara, toward the [[Niger]] river and actual [[Timbuktu]]. 
*through the Tibesti mountains, toward Lake Chad and actual [[Nigeria]] 
*through the [[Nile]] river, toward actual [[Uganda]]. 
*though the western coast of Africa, toward the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Cape Verde]] islands. 
*through the [[Red Sea]], toward actual [[Somalia]] and perhaps [[Tanzania]].

All these expeditions were supported by legionaries and had mainly a commercial purpose. Only the one done by emperor [[Nero]] seemed to be a preparative for the conquest of [[Ethiopia]] or [[Nubia]]: in 62 AD two legionaries explored the sources of the Nile river.

One of the main reasons of the explorations was to get gold using the camel to transport it.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Jonathan 2002. ''The Roman Army in Tripolitana and Gold Trade with Sub-Saharan Africa''. APA Annual Convention. New Orleans.&lt;/ref&gt;

The explorations near the African western and eastern coasts were supported by Roman ships and deeply related to the naval commerce (mainly toward the [[Indian Ocean]]).
Romans organized several explorations also in Northern Europe, and as far as Asia up to China .

;30 BC-640 AD: With the acquisition of Ptolemaic Egypt, [[Roman trade with India|The Romans begin trading with India]]. The Empire now has a direct connection to the [[Spice trade]] Egypt had established beginning in 118 BC.

;100 AD-166 AD: [[Romano-Chinese relations]] begin. [[Ptolemy]] [[Geography (Ptolemy)|writes]] of the [[Golden Chersonese]] (i.e. [[Malay Peninsula]]) and the trade port of [[Kattigara]], now identified as [[Óc Eo]] in northern [[Vietnam]], then part of [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]], a province of the Chinese [[Han dynasty|Han Empire]]. The [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese historical texts]] describe Roman embassies, from a land they called ''[[Daqin]]''.

;2nd century: Roman traders reach [[Siam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Java]].

;161: An embassy from Roman Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] or his successor [[Marcus Aurelius]] reaches Chinese [[Emperor Huan of Han]] at [[Luoyang]].

;226: A Roman diplomat or merchant lands in northern Vietnam and visits [[Nanjing]], China and the court of [[Sun Quan]], ruler of [[Eastern Wu]]

===Chinese exploration of Central Asia===
During the 2nd century BC, the [[Han dynasty]] explored much of the Eastern Northern Hemisphere. Starting in 139 BC, the Han diplomat [[Zhang Qian]] traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the Da [[Yuezhi]] against the [[Xiongnu]] (the Yuezhi had been evicted from [[Gansu]] by the Xiongnu in 177 BC); however, Zhang's travels discovered entire countries which the Chinese were unaware of, including the [[Hellenistic civilization|remnants of the conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]] (r. 336–323 BC).{{sfnm|di Cosmo|2002|1pp=247–249|Yü|1986|2p=407|Torday|1997|3p=104|4a1=Morton|4a2=Lewis|4y=2005|4pp=54–55}} When Zhang returned to China in 125 BC, he reported on his visits to [[Dayuan]] ([[Fergana]]), [[Kangju]] ([[Sogdiana]]), and [[Daxia]] ([[Bactria]], formerly the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] which had just been subjugated by the Da Yuezhi).{{sfn|Torday|1997|pp=105–106}} Zhang described Dayuan and Daxia as agricultural and urban countries like China, and although he did not venture there, described Shendu (the [[Indus River]] valley of [[Northwestern India]]) and Anxi ([[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] territories) further west.{{sfn|Torday|1997|pp=108–112}}

===Viking Age===
[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|Viking settlements and voyages]]
From about 800 AD to 1040 AD, the [[Vikings]] explored Europe and much of the Western Northern Hemisphere via rivers and oceans. For example, it is known that the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Viking]] explorer, [[Erik the Red]] (950–1003), sailed to and settled in [[Greenland]] after being expelled from [[Iceland]], while his son, the [[Iceland]]ic explorer [[Leif Ericson]] (980–1020), reached [[Newfoundland]] and the nearby North American coast, and is believed to be the first [[Europe]]an to land in [[North America]].

===Polynesian Age===
[[File:Migraciones austronesias.png|thumb|[[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] expansion map]]
[[Polynesians]] were a maritime people, who populated and explored the central and [[Oceania|south Pacific]] for around 5,000 years, up to about 1280 when they discovered [[New Zealand]]. The key invention to their exploration was the [[outrigger canoe]], which provided a swift and stable platform for carrying goods and people. Based on limited evidence, it is thought that the voyage to New Zealand was deliberate. It is unknown if one or more boats went to New Zealand, or the type of boat, or the names of those who migrated. 2011 studies at [[Wairau Bar]] in New Zealand show a high probability that one origin was Ruahine Island in the [[Society Islands]]. Polynesians may have used the prevailing north easterly [[trade winds]] to reach New Zealand in about three weeks. The Cook Islands are in direct line along the migration path and may have been an intermediate stopping point. There are cultural and language similarities between [[Cook Islanders]] and New Zealand [[Māori people|Maori]]. Early Maori had different legends of their origins, but the stories were misunderstood and reinterpreted in confused written accounts by early European historians in New Zealand trying to present a coherent pattern of Maori settlement in New Zealand.

Mathematical modelling based on DNA [[Identity by descent|genome studies]], using [[state-of-the-art]] techniques, have shown that a large number of Polynesian migrants (100–200), including women, arrived in New Zealand around the same time, in about 1280.  [[Otago University]] studies have tried to link distinctive DNA teeth patterns, which show special dietary influence, with places in or nearby the [[Society Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Otago University. Wairau Bar Studies 2011.Dr L. Matisoo-Smith.2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese exploration of the Indian Ocean===
The Chinese explorer, [[Wang Dayuan]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1311–1350) made two major trips by ship to the Indian Ocean. During 1328–1333, he sailed along the [[South China Sea]] and visited many places in [[Southeast Asia]] and reached as far as [[South Asia]], landing in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]]. Then in 1334–1339, he visited [[North Africa]] and [[East Africa]]. Later, the Chinese admiral [[Zheng He]] (1371–1433) made [[Treasure voyages|seven voyages]] to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Thailand]].

===European Age of Discovery===
[[File:Viajes_de_colon_en.svg|thumb|300px|The Transatlantic [[voyages of Christopher Columbus|voyages]] of [[Christopher Columbus]]]]
The [[Age of Discovery]], also known as the Age of Exploration, is one of the most important periods of geographical exploration in human history. It started in the early 15th century and lasted until the 17th century. In that period, Europeans discovered and/or explored vast areas of the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. [[Portuguese empire|Portugal]] and [[Spanish empire|Spain]] dominated the first stages of exploration, while other European nations followed, such as [[British empire|England]], [[Dutch empire|Netherlands]], and [[French colonial empire|France]].

[[File:Map of Portuguese Carreira da India.gif|300px|thumb|Outward and return voyages of the [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India run]] in the Atlantic and the Indian oceans, with the [[North Atlantic Gyre]] (''[[Volta do mar]]'') picked up by [[Henry the Navigator|Henry]]'s navigators, and the outward route of the South Atlantic westerlies that [[Bartolomeu Dias]] discovered in 1488, followed and explored by the expeditions of [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]]]
The most important explorers of this period include: [[Diogo Cão]] (c.1452 –c.1486) who discovered and ascended the [[Congo River]] and reached the coasts of the present-day [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]]; [[Bartolomeu Dias]] (c. 1450–1500), who was the first European to reach the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and other parts of the [[South Africa]]n coast; [[Christopher Columbus]] (1451–1506), who led a [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ([[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]) expedition across the Atlantic, [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovering America]]; [[Vasco da Gama]] (1460–1524), a navigator who made the first trip from Europe to India and back by the Cape of Good Hope, discovering the ocean route to the [[East]]; [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]] (c. 1467/68–c.1520) who, following the path of Gama, claimed [[Brazil]] and led the first expedition that linked Europe, Africa, America, and Asia; [[Diogo Dias]], who discovered the eastern coast of [[Madagascar]] and rounded the corner of Africa; explorers such as [[Diogo Fernandes Pereira]] and [[Pedro Mascarenhas]] (1470–1555), among others, who discovered and mapped the [[Mascarene Islands]] and other archipelagos; [[António de Abreu]] (c.1480–c.1514) and [[Francisco Serrão]] (14?–1521), who led the first direct European fleet into the Pacific Ocean (on its western edges), through the [[Sunda Islands]], reaching the [[Moluccas]]; [[Juan Ponce de León]] (1474–1521), who discovered and mapped the coast of [[Florida]]; [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] (c. 1475–1519), who was the first European to view the Pacific Ocean from American shores (after crossing the [[Isthmus of Panama]]) confirming that America was a separate continent from Asia; [[Ferdinand Magellan]] (1480–1521), who was the first navigator to cross the Pacific Ocean, discovering the [[Strait of Magellan]], the [[Tuamotus]] and [[Mariana Islands]], achieving a nearly complete [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth, in multiple voyages, for the first time; [[Juan Sebastian Elcano]] (1476–1526), who completed the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|global circumnavigation]]; [[Aleixo Garcia]] (14?–1527), who explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], crossing the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and reaching the [[Andes]] (near [[Sucre]]); [[Jorge de Menezes]] (c. 1498–?), who discovered [[Papua New Guinea]]; [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] (1490–1526), who discovered the [[Marshall Islands]]; [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] (1490–1558), who discovered the [[Mississippi River]] and was the first European to sail the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and cross [[Texas]]; [[Jacques Cartier]] (1491–1557), who drew the first maps of part of central and maritime Canada; [[Andres de Urdaneta]] (1498–1568), who discovered the maritime route from Asia to the Americas; [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]] (1510–1554), who discovered the [[Grand Canyon]] and the [[Colorado River]]; [[Francisco de Orellana]] (1511–1546), who was the first European to navigate the length of the [[Amazon River]].

Continuing in the second half of the 16th century and the 17th century with explorers such as [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] (1498–1568), who discovered the maritime route from Asia to the Americas; [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira|Álvaro de Mendaña]] (1542–1595), who discovered the [[Tuvalu]] archipelago, the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Wake Island]]; [[Willem Janszoon]] (1570–1630), who made the first recorded European landing in Australia; [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]] (1565–1614), who discovered the [[Pitcairn Islands]] and the [[Vanuatu]] archipelago; [[Yñigo Ortiz de Retez]], who discovered and reached eastern and northern [[New Guinea]]; [[Luis Váez de Torres]] (1565–1613), who discovered the [[Torres Strait]] between [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]]; [[Henry Hudson]] (156?–1611), who explored the [[Hudson Bay]] in Canada; [[Samuel de Champlain]] (1574–1635), who explored  [[St. Lawrence River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] (in Canada and northern United States); [[Abel Tasman]] (1603–1659), who explored North Australia, discovered [[Tasmania]] and [[New Zealand]]; and [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] (1643–1687), who explored the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, and the entire length of the Mississippi River.

Long after the golden age of discovery, other explorers ''completed'' the world map, such as various [[Russian Empire|Russians]] explorers, reaching the [[Siberia]]n Pacific coast and the [[Bering Strait]], at the extreme edge of Asia and Alaska (North America); [[Vitus Bering]] (1681–1741) who in the service of the Russian Navy, explored the [[Bering Strait]], the [[Bering Sea]], the North American coast of [[Alaska]], and some other northern areas of the Pacific Ocean; and [[James Cook]], who explored the east coast of Australia, the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and circumnavigated the Antarctic continent.

===Space exploration===
Humanity is continuing to follow the impulse to explore, moving beyond [[Earth]].  [[Space exploration]] started in the 20th century with the invention of exo-atmospheric [[rocket]]s.  This has given humans the opportunity to travel to the [[moon]], and to send robotic explorers to other [[planet]]s and far beyond.

Both of the [[Voyager probes]] have left the [[Solar System]], bearing imprinted gold discs with multiple data types.

==Behavioral trait==
{{splitsection|Mobilities|date=May 2018}}
{{see|Individual mobility}}
A 2015 study, performed on mobile phone data  and on GPS tracks of private vehicles in [[Italy]], demonstrated that  individuals naturally split into two well-defined categories according to their mobility habits, dubbed "returners" and "explorers".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150908/ncomms9166/full/ncomms9166.html|title = Returners and Explorers dichotomy in Human Mobility|last = Luca Pappalardo|date = 8 September 2015|journal = Nature Communications|doi = 10.1038/ncomms9166|pmid = 26349016|display-authors=etal|volume=6|pages=8166|pmc=4569739}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"Explorers" showed a star-like  mobility pattern: they have a central core of locations (composed by home and work places) around which distant core of locations gravitates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bigdatatales.com/blog/2015/09/23/are-you-a-returner-or-an-explorer-ask-big-data/|title = Are you a returner or an explorer?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6678">'''Gabriel Øidne''' (11 February 1918 &amp;ndash; 4 April 1991) was a Norwegian geographer and historian. Analyzing regional differences in party choice in Norway, he was the first to pinpoint factors relating to [[relations of production]] as well as [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] [[cleavage (politics)|cleavages]] when describing distinctions between [[Eastern Norway|Eastern]] and [[Western Norway]]. He also wrote several works on his native region, [[Agder]], among others on the so-called child migration in older times.

==Early life and education==
Øidne was born in 1918 in [[Konsmo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Barn på vandring|last=Kubens|first=Valerie|date=9 April 2008|work=Nationen|page=6|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the [[cand.philol.]] degree at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1950, with the paper ''Audnedalen''&amp;mdash;a work on his native valley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/show?pid=991882164&amp;kid=biblio Entry] for ''Audnedalen'' in [[BIBSYS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==

===East–West distinctions in Norway===
Øidne is first and foremost known for the article ''Litt om motsetninga mellom Austlandet og Vestlandet'' (On the Distinction Between Eastern and Western Norway), published in the periodical ''[[Syn og Segn]]'' in 1957 and which was also selected for the [[Norwegian Sociology Canon]] in 2009–2011. In it, he began by discrediting popular theories of the impact of [[topography]] on people, as well as Andreas Hansen's race theories. Instead, he cited differences in [[relations of production]]; Western Norway was more egalitarian than Eastern Norway. Also, he noted that three [[counter-culture]]s were rooted Western Norway, creating [[cleavage (politics)|cleavages]] towards the rest of Norway: [[Landsmål]], [[temperance movement|temperance]] and [[laity]]{{Clarify|date=May 2009}}.&lt;ref name=forr&gt;{{cite news|title=Døperen Gabriel|last=Forr|first=Gudleiv|authorlink=Gudleiv Forr|date=9 April 2007|work=Dagbladet|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, Øidne tied these counter-cultures to the [[Liberal Party of Norway|Liberal]] and [[Christian Democratic Party of Norway|Christian Democratic]] parties.&lt;ref name=forr/&gt; He also noted the similarity in support of the Christian Democratic Party and the short-lived [[Moderate Liberal Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rokkan|first=Stein|authorlink=Stein Rokkan|title=Stat, nasjon, klasse|editor=[[Bernt Hagtvet|Hagtvet, Bernt]] (ed.)|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|year=1987|pages=150, 151, 172|chapter=Geografi, religion og samfunnsklasse: kryssende konfliktlinjer i norsk politikk|isbn=82-00-02533-0|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the article laid the grounds for voter sociology, a subset of [[political sociology]] which explores the ties between political party choices and the sociological characteristics of the electorate.&lt;ref name=forr/&gt;

In the same year that Øidne published the article, the first election survey in Norway was held, administered by the [[Norwegian Institute of Social Research]] in conjunction with the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1957|Norwegian parliamentary election of 1957]]. Inspirations in addition to Øidne include [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] et al.'s book ''The People's Choice''.&lt;ref name=nou&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aardal|first1=Bernt|last2=Valen | first2=Henry |author-link1=Bernt Aardal |author-link2=Henry Valen |title=[[Norwegian Official Report|NOU]] 2001: 3.

Øidne never developed his own theories, limiting himself to only one article,&lt;ref&gt;Rokkan, 1987: p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; but in later research his theories were developed scientifically by internationally renowned political scientists [[Henry Valen]] and [[Stein Rokkan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Velgernes venn|last=Forr|first=Gudleiv|date=29 January 2007|work=Dagbladet|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneer works were ''Regional Contrasts in Norwegian Politics'', published in 1964 by Rokkan and Valen, and ''Party Systems and Voter Alignments'', published in 1967 by Rokkan and [[Seymour Martin Lipset]].&lt;ref name=nou/&gt;

In 1973 Øidne issued the book ''Østkant og vestkant i Oslos politiske historie: sosial og politisk struktur i Oslo 1906–69'', about the distinctions between eastern and western [[Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/show?pid=752164627&amp;kid=biblio Entry] for ''Østkant og vestkant i Oslos politiske historie'' in [[BIBSYS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child migration===
Øidne also wrote on child migration in the [[Agder]] region, among others in the 1955 work ''Vest-Agder heimkunnskap''.&lt;ref name=fv&gt;{{cite news|title=Overbefolkning ga nød|last=Kubens|first=Valerie|date=9 April 2008|work=Fædrelandsvennen|page=13|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of this field has traditionally been severely underdeveloped in Norway,&lt;ref name=nationen&gt;{{cite news|title=Historien om barnevandringene|last=Lie|first=Øystein|date=19 December 1997|work=Aftenposten|page=25|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Øidne grew up in this region and was aware of the practice,&lt;ref name=fv/&gt; which took place between c.1750 and c.1910. Because of poverty, children in [[Southern Norway]] were sent to work during the summer. The migration typically took place from valleys in [[Vest-Agder]]&amp;mdash;[[Kvinesdal]], [[Lyngdalen]], [[Audnedalen]], [[Mandalen]], [[Marnardal]], [[Åseral]] and [[Sirdal]] as well as [[Lindesnes]]&amp;mdash;to more affluent areas in [[Aust-Agder]], often near the coast&amp;mdash;[[Høvåg]], [[Landvik]], [[Arendal]] and [[Grimstad]] as well as [[Birkenes]] and [[Iveland]]. Many emigrated to the United States when they reached adolescence.&lt;ref name=nationen/&gt; In the late phase of his life Øidne assisted the [[screenwriter]] and [[film director]] Grete Salomonsen Hynnekleiv, who spent many years working on a screenplay, Yohan Barnevandrer, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1230478/?ref_=nm_knf_i1, which she also directed. The film was released in 2010 en featured Kris Kristoffersen as the story-teller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=- Et skambelagt tema|last=|first=|date=3 May 2008|work=Nationen|page=27|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Barton Cutten''' (1874–1962) was a Canadian-born psychologist, moral philosopher, historian and university administrator. He was president of [[Acadia University]] from 1910 to 1922 and [[Colgate University]] from 1922 to 1942.

==Career==

Born in [[Amherst, Nova Scotia]], the son of a stipendiary magistrate,&lt;ref&gt;J. Ernest Kerr, ''Imprint of the Maritimes'', 1959, Boston: Christopher Publishing, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; he was uncertain about what path his life should take. He had various jobs including reporter, salesman, and [[pipe fitter]] before his uncle locked him in a room, refusing to let him out until he agreed to go to university.&lt;ref name="Colgate’s Cutten"&gt;''Time Magazine'', February 2, 1942 [http://205.188.238.109/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849752,00.html "Colgate’s Cutten"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529223031/http://205.188.238.109/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849752,00.html |date=2011-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the fall of 1892, he had enrolled at Acadia University, [[Wolfville, Nova Scotia|Wolfville]], where he joined the varsity rugby team and within three years had led the team to victory over rival [[Dalhousie University]] in 1895. He earned his BA in 1896 and a year later he was ordained a [[Baptist]] minister.

He went on to [[Yale University]] and by 1902 he had earned a degree in [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]] and a [[PhD]] in psychology. There he continued his outstanding career as a football player and, on Sundays, served as a preacher at local churches. His thesis was titled ''The Psychology of Alcoholism'' which was published, in revised form, in 1907. He was appointed professor of moral philosophy, but returned to Wolfville in 1910 to accept a position as president of the university. For more than a decade at Acadia, he actively supported the university’s sporting programs and opened the Memorial Gym in 1920, a facility which continues to function today.&lt;ref&gt;Acadia University: [http://library.acadiau.ca/archives/sporthistory/athletes/male/cutten.html "George Barton Cutten"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164138/http://library.acadiau.ca/archives/sporthistory/athletes/male/cutten.html |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the onset of the [[First World War]], Cutten took time off to recruit for the war effort. In February 1916, he asked the board at Acadia to grant him, "a leave of absence to enable him to pursue recruitment full time" &lt;ref name="Paul Axelrod 1989, p. 146"&gt;Paul Axelrod, "Youth, University, and Canadian Society: Essays in the Social History of Higher Education.", 1989, Kingston: McGill-Queen's UP, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; This leave would be extended to June 1917, and Cutten then took another leave to go to Halifax and help the city recover from the [[Halifax Explosion]]. Cutten actively encouraged students of Acadia to join the war effort as well. He would later become embroiled in a feud with [[Sir Sam Hughes]] over the breaking up of Nova Scotian battalions in order to reinforce other provincial battalions.&lt;ref name="Paul Axelrod 1989, p. 146"/&gt;

After twelve years at Acadia, in 1922 he moved to [[Hamilton (village), New York|Hamilton, New York]] where he had accepted the presidency of [[Colgate University]]. He altered the university admissions policy to block the admissions of African Americans and severely limited the admissions of Jewish students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finding the university’s financial affairs in disorder he set out to turn its finances around. For the next seventeen years the school declared a surplus, in the meantime doubling its faculty, plant and assets. His football teams also won championships. In 1928, he introduced the "Colgate Plan," an influential curriculum.

He retired from Colgate in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;''Time Magazine'', February 2, 1942, [http://205.188.238.109/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849752,00.html "Colgate’s Cutten" ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529223031/http://205.188.238.109/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849752,00.html |date=2011-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later work and personal life==

In his retirement, Cutten devoted his efforts to a vocation entirely divorced from his academic pursuits. Arising from an interest in American [[Silver (household)|silver]] which began in the 1930s, in which he amassed one of the finest private collections of his time,&lt;ref name="Colgate’s Cutten"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Richard McKinstry, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KNP516OCwowC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=%22george+b+cutten%22+silver&amp;source=web&amp;ots=aGrgX3Jdaq&amp;sig=aYnFvqdJ-bS0YN3I9KX5oa3n-8U ''Guide to the Winterthur Library: The Joseph Downs Collection''], Winterthur Museum, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; he published several pioneering works on the history of silver design and manufacture.

He was married to Minnie W. Brown who shared his passion for silver and contributed to his books on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spencermarks.com/cgibin/webc.cgi/sz/st_prod.html?p_prodid=121&amp;p_catid=&amp;sid=9DnBVa1kgEsa7fn-52107331481.84 Article on "Silversmiths of North Carolina 1696-1860"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=C.

==Legacy and latter reassessment==

A women’s residence named after Cutten opened at Acadia University in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/acadiacommunications/docs/bulletin_f2011_web|title=Residences Through the Years|last=|first=|date=November 15, 2011|work=Acadia University Bulletin|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A residence hall complex and its associated dining hall at Colgate were named for him in 1966. Controversy erupted over the name in 2001 and resulted in a serious debate about his role as a [[Eugenics|eugenicist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kendrick.colgate.edu/maroon/archivesS01/022301/news/cutten.html|title=Students Condemn Cutten|last=Compter|first=Sarah|date=June 25, 2001|website=The Colgate Maroon-News|archive-url=https://archive.li/20010625044942/http://kendrick.colgate.edu/maroon/archivesS01/022301/news/cutten.html|archive-date=June 25, 2001|dead-url=yes|access-date=July 20, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At issue was his statement to the Canadian Society of New York in 1923 that "the [[Melting pot#United States|melting pot]] is destructive to our race ... we must build up from our resources and conserve our race power, or else we must admit only such immigrants as shall strengthen and not weaken our race, or both.

'''Gladys Iola Tantaquidgeon''' (June 15, 1899 – November 1, 2005) was a [[Mohegan]] [[medicine woman]],&lt;ref name="Mohegan-a"&gt;{{cite web|title = Gladys Tantaquidgeon|publisher = The Mohegan Tribe|date = November 1, 2005|url = http://www.mohegan.nsn.us/heritage/gt_makiawisug.aspx|accessdate = 2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologist, author, tribal council member, and [[American Indian elder|elder]] based in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="CWHF"&gt;[http://www.cwhf.org/inductees/education-preservation/gladys-tantaquidgeon/ "Gladys Tantaquidgeon"], Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young girl, she was selected by women elders for training in traditional pharmacology and culture. She studied anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania with [[Frank Speck]]. Beginning in 1934, Tantaquidgeon  worked with the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] for more than a decade, including several years among western Native American tribes. Together with her father and brother, in 1931 she founded the [[Tantaquidgeon Indian Museum]], the oldest to be owned and operated by Native Americans.

She published several books about Native American traditional medicine and healing with plants. For years she preserved vital records and correspondence of tribal members, which proved integral to their making the case for [[federally recognized tribes|federal recognition]], which the Mohegan received in 1994. That year, Tantaquidgeon was inducted into the [[Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame]].

== Biography ==
Gladys Tantaquidgeon&lt;ref&gt;"Running Against Time - Medicine Woman Preserves Mohegan Culture". School of Anthropology; Alumni Newsletter. University of Pennsylvania. Summer 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; was the third of seven children born to [[Mohegan]] parents, John and Harriet Fielding Tantaquidgeon.&lt;ref&gt;Gladys Tantaquidgeon - Obituary". Hartford Courant. November 5, 2005. Retrieved 25 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They lived on Mohegan Hill in Quinnetucket ([[Uncasville, Connecticut|Uncasville]], in New London County, [[Connecticut]]).  She was a 10th-generation descendant of the Mohegan chief [[Uncas]], who was prominent in the colonial era. Culturally, the Mohegan tribe is Algonkian; linguistically, they speak one of the many [[Algonquian languages]].

In childhood, Gladys learned traditional practices, beliefs, and lore from ''nanus,'' respected women elders.  By age five, the tribal ''nanus'' had chosen her to be schooled in the traditions of Mohegan culture. One of her mentors was the Mohegan traditionalist [[Fidelia Fielding]] (1827&amp;ndash;1908). From Fielding, she learned the ways of the ''makiawisug'' who guard the healing plants.&lt;ref&gt;"Fidelia Fielding, 1827-1908," Mohegan Tribe Official Website, 2004 (retrieved 13 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another mentor was her maternal aunt, ''Nanu'' [[Emma Fielding Baker]] (1828-1916). In 1992 Baker was posthumously elected by the tribe as the Mohegan Tribal Medicine Woman and was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame for her work in education and preservation. Gladys started studying with her aunt in 1904, specializing in traditional herbal medicine, and attending classes in local schools.&lt;ref&gt;"Running Against Time - Medicine Woman Preserves Mohegan Culture." Alumni Newsletter, Summer 2001, University of Pennsylvania."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, at the age of 20, Tantaquidgeon attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to study [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://connecticuthistory.org/gladys-tantaquidgeon-preserves-the-states-native-past/ Medicine Woman Gladys Tantaquidgeon and Mohegan Cultural Renewal] Connecticut Humanities&lt;/ref&gt; Penn anthropologist [[Frank Speck]] met Gladys as a child while he was working with her ''nanu'' Fidelia Fielding. When Gladys was old enough, Speck invited her to study with him at Penn; he arranged housing with foreign students at his home in Swarthmore, enrolled her in classes, and enlisted her as a fieldwork assistant to broaden her understanding of Native American cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Tantaquidgeon Zobel (2018) “Forward.” In Savage Kin: Indigenous Informants and American Anthropologists, by Margaret M. Bruchac, pp. ix-xiii. Tucson: University of Arizona Press. Also see Margaret M. Bruchac (2018) “Indian Stories: Gladys Tantaquidgeon and Frank Speck.” In Savage Kin: Indigenous Informants and American Anthropologists, pp. 140-175. Tucson: University of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Tantaquidgeon later did field work related to the [[Lenape]] and other eastern Algonquian tribes. She expanded her knowledge of traditional [[pharmacopeia]] by researching herbal medicine practices among many related East Coast tribes.

From 1934 to 1947, at the time of the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] and the [[Indian New Deal]] under the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Tantaquidgeon started work with the US [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. She was hired in 1934 under the [[Wheeler-Howard Act]] to administer social service benefits for Indians. At first she was assigned to the [[Yankton Indian Reservation|Yankton Sioux Indian Reservation]] in [[South Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Jayne Fawcett (2000) Medicine Trail: The Life and Lessons of Gladys Tantaquidgeon. Tucson: University
of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 Tantaquidgeon transferred to the [[Indian Arts and Crafts Board]] to serve as a "Native Arts Specialist". Working in the Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming, she helped indigenous artisans preserve traditional skills and arts. In addition, she helped them form cooperatives and other institutions for the sale and management of their arts. She developed ways for tribes to revive their cultural practices. According to the Mohegan Tribal Historian [[Melissa Tantaquidgeon Zobel|Melissa Fawcett]], while working for the federal Indian Arts and Crafts Board, Tantaquidgeon also helped preserve customs that had been prohibited in the 19th century, such as the [[Ghost Dance]] and the [[Sun Dance]]. Part of Tantaquidgeon's job was to encourage the restoration of these and other previously prohibited traditional practices.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Jayne Fawcett (2000) Medicine Trail: The Life and Lessons of Gladys Tantaquidgeon. Tucson: University
of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:20131118-OC-RBN-0987.jpg|thumb|This village installation is an addition to the Tantaquidgeon Indian Museum]]
In 1931, Tantaquidgeon worked with her brother Harry, a former chief, and father John to found the [[Tantaquidgeon Indian Museum]]. It is the oldest such museum to be owned and operated by Native Americans.  After concluding her government service in 1947, Tantaquidgeon returned to Mohegan Hill, Uncasville. She worked full-time at the museum for the next 50 years, until 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Jayne Fawcett (1984). “The Role of Gladys Tantaquidgeon.” In Papers of the Fifteenth Algonquian Conference, edited by William Cowan, pp. 135–45. Ottawa, Ontario: Carleton University.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a librarian in the [[Niantic, Connecticut|Niantic]] Women’s Prison in the late 1940s, Tantaquidgeon had helped minority women. During the 1970s and 1980s, she also served on the Mohegan Tribal Council, encouraging the preservation and revival of tribal customs and language.

She published several books in her lifetime about traditional herbal medicine.  Her best-known work, ''[https://archive.org/details/studyofdelawarei00tant A Study of Delaware Indian Medicine Practices and Folk Beliefs]'' (1942) was reprinted in 1972, 1995 and 2000 as ''[https://archive.org/details/folkmedicineofde00tant_0 Folk Medicine of the Delaware and Related Algonkian Indians].'' In 1992 she was elected as the Tribal Medicine Woman of the Mohegan.

Tantaquidgeon preserved numerous records and tribal correspondence in boxes under her bed. These proved critical as documentation to aid the [[Mohegan people#recognition|tribe's case for federal recognition]]. The tribe proved community continuity and was acknowledged as federally recognized in 1994, as part of a settlement linked to their claim for the lands that make up the present-day Mohegan reservation.&lt;ref&gt;"Running Against Time - Medicine Woman Preserves Mohegan Culture." Alumni Newsletter, Summer 2001, University of Pennsylvania."&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Gladys Tantaquidgeon was the great-aunt of [[Melissa Tantaquidgeon Zobel]], an author and the current Mohegan Medicine Woman.

[[File:Haymond Maxwell (1879-1958) (8412475171) (4).jpg|thumb|Haymond Maxwell (1879-1958)]]

==Early life and career==
Maxwell was the son of [[Edwin Maxwell (attorney general)|Edwin Maxwell]], a prominent West Virginia judge and politician, and Loretta Shuttleworth. Maxwell was educated in the public schools and then at [[West Virginia University]], graduating in 1900. He received a law degree there in 1901. He opened a practice in Clarksburg, and was elected to the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] in 1905 as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. In May 1909 he was appointed as judge of the criminal court in [[Harrison County, West Virginia|Harrison County]], serving until 1912. As of December 1909 he was, at the age of 30, the youngest judge in the state.&lt;ref&gt;'''The Bar''', December 1909, West Virginia Bar Association, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 and 1920 he was elected to eight-year terms as Circuit Court judge.&lt;ref&gt;History of West Virginia, Old and New, Volume 3, Chicago and New York: American Historical Society, 1923, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned in 1925 to return to private practice. He was appointed to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals on August 21, 1928, and elected on the Republican ticket to a full term in November of that year, serving until December 31, 1940. He was unsuccessful in seeking re-election in 1940 and 1944.

Maxwell married his distant cousin Carrie Virginia Maxwell in 1905; they had five children. His son Porter Wilson Maxwell commanded a squadron of Navy divebombers during World War II; he was killed in action on July 24, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;https://donmooreswartales.com/2013/09/30/bill-timmis/ Blog post, republished article from '''Charlotte Sun''' newspaper, Port Charlotte, Florida, June 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron|Hebron Protocol]] of 1997 divided the city into two sectors: H1, controlled by the Palestinian Authority and H2, roughly 20% of the city, administered by Israel.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/tiph5.html An Introduction to the City of Hebron&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; All security arrangements and travel permits for local residents are coordinated between the Palestinian Authority and Israel via [[Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories|military administration of the West Bank (COGAT)]].  The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the [[Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron]].

Hebron is a busy hub of [[West Bank]] trade, generating roughly a third of the area's [[gross domestic product]], largely due to the sale of limestone from quarries in its area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zacharia|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, limestone, [[Palestinian pottery|pottery]] workshops and [[Hebron glass|glassblowing]] factories, and is the location of the major dairy-product manufacturer, ''al-Juneidi''. The old city of Hebron features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old [[bazaar]]s. The city is home to [[Hebron University]] and to the [[Palestine Polytechnic University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hasasneh|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flusfeder|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hebron is attached to cities of [[ad-Dhahiriya]], [[Dura, Hebron|Dura]], [[Yatta, Hebron|Yatta]], the surrounding villages with no borders. Hebron Governorate is the largest Palestinian governorate, with a population of 600,364 {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}}.&lt;ref name="PNIC"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name "Hebron" traces back to two [[Semitic languages|Semitic roots]], which coalesce in the form ''ḥbr'', having reflexes in [[Hebrew]] and [[Amorite]] and denoting a range of meanings from "colleague", "unite" or "friend". In the proper name ''Hebron'', the original sense may have been ''alliance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cazelles|1981|p=195}} compares Amorite ''ḫibrum''. Two roots are in play, ''ḥbr/ḫbr''. The root has magical overtones, and develops pejorative connotations in late Biblical usage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic term derives from the Qur'anic epithet for Abraham, ''Khalil al-Rahman'' ({{lang|ar|إبراهيم خليل الرحمن}}) "Beloved of the Merciful" or "Friend of God".&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an 4:125/Surah 4 Aya (verse) 125, ''[[Qur'an]]'' ({{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/hollywood/lot/6093/4nisa.html |title=source text |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027154527/http://www.geocities.com/hollywood/lot/6093/4nisa.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |df= }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=194 n.220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic ''Al-Khalil'' thus precisely translates the ancient Hebrew [[toponym]] ''Ḥebron'', understood as ''ḥaber'' (friend).&lt;ref name="Sharon 2007 104"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharon|2007|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Hebron}}
{{split section|History of Hebron|date=July 2017}}

===Canaanite period===
[[File:Hebron001.JPG|right|thumb|250px|[[Cave of the Patriarchs]]]]
Archaeological excavations reveal traces of strong fortifications dated to the Early [[Bronze Age]], covering some 24–30 [[dunam]]s centered around [[Tel Rumeida]]. The city flourished in the 17th–18th centuries BCE before being destroyed by fire, and was resettled in the late Middle Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Negev|Gibson|2001|pp=225–5&lt;!--?range of pages--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Na'aman|2005|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; This older Hebron was originally a [[Canaan]]ite royal city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Towner|2001|pp=144–45}}: "[T]he city was a Canaanite royal center long before it became Israelite".&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Abraham|Abrahamic legend]] associates the city with the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittites]]. It has been conjectured that Hebron might have been the capital of [[Šuwardata|Shuwardata]] of [[Gath (city)|Gath]], an (Canaanite)[[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] contemporary of Jerusalem's regent, [[Abdi-Kheba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albright|2000|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Hebron hills were almost devoid of settlements in the Late Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Na'aman|2005|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic traditions]] associated with Hebron are nomadic, and may also reflect a [[Kenite]] element, since the nomadic Kenites are said to have long occupied the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1903|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Heber'' is the name for a Kenite clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kraeling|1825|p=179}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the narrative of the later Hebrew conquest, Hebron was one of two centres under Canaanite control and ruled by the three sons of [[Anak]] (''b&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;nê/y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;lîdê hā'ănaq''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Na'aman|2005|p=361}} These non-semitic names perhaps echo either a tradition of a group of elite professional troops (Philistines, Hittites), formed in Canaan whose ascendancy was overthrow by the West-semitic clan of Caleb, which would have migrated from the Negev,&lt;/ref&gt; or may reflect some Kenite and [[Kenizzite]] migration from the Negev to Hebron, since terms related to the Kenizzites appear to be close to [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], which suggests that behind the [[Anakim]] legend lies some early Hurrian population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Blenkinsopp]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=uxg9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA114  ''Gibeon and Israel,''] Cambridge University Press 1972 p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; In Biblical lore they are represented as descendants of the [[Nephilim]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua]] 10:3, 5, 3–39; 12:10, 13. {{harvnb|Na'aman|2005|p=177}} doubts this tradition. "The book of Joshua is not a reliable source for either a historical or a  territorial discussion of the Late Bronze Age, and its evidence must be disregarded".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Genesis]] mentions that it was formerly called [[Kiryat Arba|Kirjath-arba]], or "city of four", possibly referring to the four pairs or couples who were buried there, or four tribes, or four quarters,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mulder|2004|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; four hills,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alter|1996|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or a confederated settlement of four families.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1995|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Abraham's purchase of the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] from the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittites]] constitutes a seminal element in what was to become the Jewish attachment to the land&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in that it signified the first "real estate" of Israel long before the conquest under Joshua.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lied|2008|pp=154–62, 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In settling here, Abraham is described as making his first [[wiktionary:covenant|covenant]], an alliance with two local [[Amorite]] clans who became his ''ba’alei brit'' or ''masters of the covenant''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elazar|1998|p=128}}: ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].ch. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Jewish period===
[[File:Hebron136.JPG|thumb|175px|Excavations at [[Tel Rumeida]]]]
The Hebron of the Bible was centered on what is now known as Tel Rumeida, while its ritual centre was located at [[Mamre|Elonei Mamre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Magen|2007|p=185}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to have been wrested from the Canaanites by either [[Joshua]], who is said to have wiped out all of its previous inhabitants, "destroying everything that drew breath, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glick|1994|p=46}}, citing {{Bibleref2|Joshua 10:36–42}} and the influence this has had on certain settlers in the West Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[tribe of Judah]] as a whole, or specifically [[Caleb]] the Judahite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gottwald|1999|p=153}}: "certain conquests claimed for Joshua are elsewhere attributed to single tribes or clans, for example, in the case of Hebron (in {{Bibleref2|Joshua 10:36–37}}, Hebron's capture is attributed to Joshua; in {{Bibleref2|Judges 1:10}} to Judah; in Judges 1:20 and Joshua 14:13–14; 15:13–14" to Caleb.&lt;/ref&gt; The town itself, with some contiguous pasture land, is then said to have been granted to the [[Levites]] of the clan of [[Kohathites|Kohath]], while the fields of the city, as well as its surrounding villages were assigned to Caleb ({{Bibleref2|Joshua 21:3–12; 1 Chronicles 6:54–56}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratcher|Newman|1983|p=262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who expels the three giants, [[Sheshai]], [[Ahiman]], and [[Talmai]], who ruled the city. Later, the biblical narrative has [[King David]] called by God to relocate to Hebron and reign from there for some seven years ({{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 2:1–3}}).&lt;ref name="FritzDavies19962"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etRoNida3RgC|title=The Origins of the Ancient Israelite States|author=Schafer-Lichtenberger|date=1 September 1996|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|others=Philip R.

It became one of the principal centers of the [[Kingdom of Judah|Tribe of Judah]] and was classified as one of the six traditional [[Cities of Refuge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Japhet|1993|p=148}}. See {{Bibleref2|Joshua 20, 1–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As is shown by the discovery at [[Lachish]], the second most important Judean city after Jerusalem,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hasson|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of seals with the inscription [[LMLK seal|''lmlk Hebron'']] (to the king Hebron),&lt;ref name="Sharon 2007 104"/&gt; Hebron continued to constitute an important local economic centre, given its strategic position on the crossroads between the [[Dead Sea]] to the east, Jerusalem to the north, the  Negev and Egypt to the south, and the [[Shfela|Shepelah]] and the [[Israeli coastal plain|coastal plain]] to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jericke|2003|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lying along [[Way of the Patriarchs|trading routes]], it remained administratively and politically dependent on Jerusalem for this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jericke|2003|pp=26ff., 31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic antiquity – Second Jewish period===
[[File:Samson Fenster aus Alpirsbach.jpg|thumb|[[Samson]] removes gates of Gaza (left) and brings it to mount Hebron (right). Strassburg (1160–1170),  [[Landesmuseum Württemberg|Württemberg State Museum]] in Stuttgart]]
After the destruction of the [[First Temple]], most of the Jewish inhabitants of Hebron were exiled, and according to the conventional view,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1999|pp=96–99}} Carter challenges this view on the grounds that it has no archeological support.&lt;/ref&gt; some researchers found traces of [[Edom]]ite presence after the 5th-4th centuries BCE, as the area became [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid province]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lemaire|2006|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the wake of [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest, Hebron was throughout the [[Hellenistic period]] under the influence of Idumea (as the new area inhabited by the Edomites was called during the [[Yehud medinata|Persian]], [[History of ancient Israel and Judah#Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Judea (Roman province)#Judea as Roman province(s)|Roman]] periods), as is attested by inscriptions for that period bearing names with the Edomite God [[Qaus|Qōs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jericke|2003|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews also appear to have lived there after the return from the [[Babylonian exile]] ({{Bibleref2|Nehemiah 11:25}}). During the [[Maccabean revolt]], Hebron was burnt and plundered by [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah Maccabee]] who fought against the Edomites in 167 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Josephus|1860|p=334}} [[Josephus Flavius]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', Bk. 12, ch.8, para.6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duke|2010|pp=93–94}} is sceptical.'This should be considered a raid on Hebron instead of a conquest based on subsequent events in the book of I Maccabees.'&lt;/ref&gt; The city appears to have long resisted [[Hasmoneans|Hasmonean dominance]], however, and indeed as late as the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] was still considered [[Idumean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duke|2010|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  present day city of Hebron was settled in the valley downhill from Tel Rumeida at the latest by Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jericke|2003|p=17}}:'Spätestens in römischer Zeit ist die Ansiedlung im Tal beim heutigen Stadtzentrum zu finden'.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herod the Great]], king of Judea, built the wall which still surrounds the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]]. During the [[First Jewish-Roman War]], Hebron was captured and plundered by [[Simon Bar Giora]], a [[Peasantry (Judea)|peasantry faction]] leader, without bloodshed. The "little town" was later laid to waste by [[Vespasian]]'s officer [[Sextus Vettulenus Cerialis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Josephus|1860|p=701}} Josephus, ''[[The Jewish War]]'', Bk 4, ch. 9, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]] wrote that he "slew all he found there, young and old, and burnt down the town." After the defeat of [[Simon bar Kokhba]] in 135 CE, innumerable Jewish captives were sold into slavery at Hebron's [[Mamre|Terebinth]] slave-market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schürer|Millar|Vermes|1973|p=553 n.178}} citing [[Jerome]], ''in Zachariam'' 11:5; ''in Hieremiam'' 6:18; ''Chronicon paschale.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hezser|2002|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Palaestina Prima]] province at the [[Diocese of the East]]. The Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] erected a Christian church over the Cave of Machpelah in the 6th century CE, which was later destroyed by the [[Sassanid]] general [[Shahrbaraz]] in 614 when [[Khosrau II]]'s armies besieged and took Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norwich|1999|p=285}}&lt;!-- check Peng ed  p. 285 (1988)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were not permitted  to reside in Hebron under Byzantine rule.&lt;ref name="Scharfstein 124"/&gt; The sanctuary itself however was spared by the Persians, in deference to the Jewish population, who were numerous in the [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628|Sassanid army]].&lt;ref name="Salaville 1910 185"&gt;{{harvnb|Salaville|1910|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic era===
Hebron was one of the last cities of Palestine to fall to the Islamic invasion in the 7th century, possibly the reason why Hebron is not mentioned in any traditions of the Arab conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gil|1997|pp=56–57}} cites the late testimony of two monks, Eudes and Arnoul CE 1119–1120:'When they (the Muslims) came to Hebron they were amazed to see the strong and handsome structures of the walls and they could not find an opening through which to enter, then the Jews happened to come, who lived in the area under the former rule of the Greeks (that is the Byzantines), and they said to the Muslims: give us (a letter of security) that we may continue to live (in our places) under your rule (literally-amongst you) and permit us to build a synagogue in front of the entrance (to the city). If you will do this, we shall show you where you can break in. And it was so'.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the city, Jerusalem's conqueror, Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab permitted Jewish people to return and to construct a small synagogue within the Herodian precinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiro|1999|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] established rule over Hebron in 638, they converted the Byzantine church at the site of Abraham's tomb into a mosque.&lt;ref name="Scharfstein 124"/&gt; It became an important station on the caravan trading  route from Egypt, and also as a way-station for pilgrims making the yearly hajj from Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic bishop [[Arculf]] who visited the Holy Land during the [[Umayyad Chaliphate|Umayyad rule]] described the city as unfortified and poor. In his writings he also mentioned camel caravans transporting firewood from Hebron to Jerusalem, which implies there was a presence of Arab nomads in the region at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Yehoshua Frenkel, 2011, p.28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Trade greatly expanded, in particular with [[Bedouin]]s in the [[Negev]] (''al-Naqab'') and the population to the east of the [[Dead Sea]] (''Baḥr Lūṭ''). According to Anton Kisa, Jews from Hebron (and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]) founded the [[Venice|Venetian]] glass-industry in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forbes|1965|p=155}}, citing Anton Kisa et al.,''Das Glas im Altertum'', 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; Islam did not view the town significant before the 10th-century, it being almost absent in Muslim literature of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gil|1997|pp=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerusalemite geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]], writing in 985 described the town as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;'Habra (Hebron) is the village of Abraham al-Khalil (the Friend of God)...Within it is a strong fortress...being of enormous squared stones. In the middle of this stands a dome of stone, built in Islamic times, over the sepulchre of Abraham. The tomb of Isaac lies forward, in the main building of the mosque, the tomb of Jacob to the rear; facing each prophet lies his wife. The enclosure has been converted into a mosque, and built around it are rest houses for the pilgrims, so that they adjoin the main edifice on all sides. A small water conduit has been conducted to them. All the countryside around this town for about half a stage has villages in every direction, with vineyards and grounds producing grapes and apples called Jabal Nahra...being fruit of unsurpassed excellence...Much of this fruit is dried, and sent to [[Egypt]].

In Hebron is a public guest house continuously open, with a cook, a baker and servants in regular attendance. These offer a dish of lentils and olive oil to every poor person who arrives, and it is set before the rich, too, should they wish to partake. Most men express the opinion this is a continuation of the guest house of Abraham, however, it is, in fact from the [[Waqf|bequest]] of [the [[sahaba]] (companion) of the prophet [[Muhammad]]] [[Tamim-al Dari]] and others.... The [[Amir]] of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]...has assigned to this charity one thousand [[dirham]]s yearly, ...al-Shar al-Adil bestowed on it a substantial bequest. At present time I do not know in all the realm of al-Islam any house of hospitality and charity more excellent than this one.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Muqaddasi|2001|pp=156–57}}. For an older translation see {{harvnb|Le Strange|1890|pp=309–10}}   [[commons:File:Strange.309.jpg|p. 309]] and [[commons:File:Strange.310.jpg|p. 310]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The custom, known as the 'table of Abraham' (''simāt al-khalil''), was similar to the one established by the [[Fatimid]]s, and in Hebron's version, it found its most famous expression. The Persian traveller [[Nasir Khusraw|Nasir-i-Khusraw]] who visited Hebron in 1047 records in his [[Safarnama]] that
:"... this Sanctuary has belonging to it very many villages that provide revenues for pious purposes. At one of these villages is a spring, where water flows out from under a stone, but in no great abundance; and it is conducted by a channel, cut in the ground, to a place outside the town (of Hebron), where they have constructed a covered tank for collecting the water...The Sanctuary ([[Mashad (architecture)|Mashad]]), stands on the southern border of the town....it is enclosed by four walls. The [[Mihrab]] (or niche) and the [[Maksurah]] (or enclosed space for Friday-prayers) stand in the width of the building (at the south end). In the Maksurah are many fine Mihrabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Le Strange|1890|pp=310–11}}   [[commons:File:Strange.310.jpg|p. 310]] and [[commons:File:Strange.311.jpg|p. 311]].&lt;/ref&gt; He further recorded that "They grow at Hebron for the most part barley, wheat being rare, but olives are in abundance. The [visitors] are given bread and olives. There are very many mills here, worked by oxen and mules, that all day long grind the flour, and further, there are working girls who, during the whole day are baking bread. The loaves are [about three pounds] and to every persons who arrives they give daily a loaf of bread, and a dish of lentils cooked in olive-oil, also some raisins....there are some days when as many as five hundred pilgrims arrive, to each of whom this hospitality is offered."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Le Strange|1890|p=315}} and [[commons:File:Strange.315.jpg|p. 315]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singer|2002|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cairo Geniza|Geniza]] documents from this period refer only to "the graves of the patriarchs" and reveal there was an organised Jewish community in Hebron who had a synagogue near the tomb, and were occupied with accommodating Jewish pilgrims and merchants. During the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk period]], the community was headed by Saadia b. Abraham b. Nathan, who was known as the "''haver'' of the graves of the patriarchs."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crusader rule===
{{see also|Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem}}
The [[Caliphate]] lasted in the area until 1099, when the Christian [[Crusade]]r [[Godfrey de Bouillon]] took Hebron and renamed it "Castellion Saint Abraham".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Smith|1856|p=78}}:'The Castle of St. Abraham' was the generic Crusader name for Hebron.'&lt;/ref&gt; It was designated capital of the southern district of the Crusader Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;Israel tourguide, Avraham Lewensohn, 1979. p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and given, in turn,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murray|2000|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the fief of Saint Abraham, to Geldemar Carpinel, the bishop Gerard of Avesnes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1965a|p=307}}Runciman also (pp. 307–08) notes that Gerard of Avesnes was a knight from [[County of Hainaut|Hainault]] held hostage at [[Arsuf]], north of [[Jaffa]], who had been wounded by Godfrey's own forces during the siege of the port, and later returned by the Muslims to Godfrey as a token of good will.&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh of Rebecques, Walter Mohamet and Baldwin of Saint Abraham.  As a [[Franks|Frankish]] garrison of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], its defence was precarious being 'little more than an island in a Moslem ocean'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1965b|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crusaders converted the [[mosque]] and the [[synagogue]] into a church. In 1106, an Egyptian campaign thrust into southern Palestine and almost succeeded the following year in wresting Hebron back from the Crusaders under [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]], who personally led the counter-charge to beat the Muslim forces off. In the year 1113 during the reign of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]], according to [[Ali ibn abi bakr al-Harawi|Ali of Herat]] (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and "a number of Franks had made their entrance therein". And they discovered "(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob", "their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more". Similar information is given in [[Ali ibn al-Athir|Ibn at Athir]]'s Chronicle under the year 1119; "In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob ...Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Le Strange|1890|pp=317–18}}   [[commons:File:Strange.317.jpg|p. 317]] and [[commons:File:Strange.318.jpg|p. 318]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Damascus|Damascene]] nobleman and historian [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]] in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of [[relics]] purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery which excited eager curiosity among all three communities in Palestine, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kohler|1896|pp=447ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1965b|p=319}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 [[Maimonides]] visited Hebron and wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;'On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (17 October), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kraemer|2001|p=422}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A royal domain, Hebron was handed over to [[Philip of Milly]] in 1161 and joined with the [[Oultrejordain|Seigneurie of Transjordan]]. A bishop was appointed to Hebron in 1168 and the new cathedral church of St Abraham was built in the southern part of the Haram.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boas|1999|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1167, the [[Hebron (titular see)|episcopal see of Hebron]] was created along with that of [[Kerak]] and [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]] (the tomb of [[John the Baptist]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richard|1999|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1170, [[Benjamin of Tudela]] visited the city, which he called by its Frankish name, ''St.Abram de Bron''.   He reported:&lt;blockquote&gt;Here there is the great church called St. Abram, and this was a Jewish place of worship at the time of the Mohammedan rule, but the Gentiles have erected there six tombs, respectively called those of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. The custodians tell the pilgrims that these are the tombs of the Patriarchs, for which information the pilgrims give them money. If a Jew comes, however, and gives a special reward, the custodian of the cave opens unto him a gate of iron, which was constructed by our forefathers, and then he is able to descend below by means of steps, holding a lighted candle in his hand. He then reaches a cave, in which nothing is to be found, and a cave beyond, which is likewise empty, but when he reaches the third cave behold there are six sepulchres, those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, respectively facing those of Sarah, Rebekah and Leah.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin|1907|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ayyubid and Mamluk rule===
The Kurdish Muslim [[Saladin]] retook Hebron in 1187 – again with Jewish assistance according to one late tradition, in exchange for a letter of security allowing them to return to the city and build a synagogue there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=207}}. Note to editors. This account, always in Moshe Gil, refers to two distinct events, the Arab conquest from Byzantium, and the Kurdish-Arab conquest from Crusaders. In both the manuscript is a monkish chronicle, and the words used, and event described is identical. We may have a secondary source confusion here.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the city was changed back to ''Al-Khalil''. A [[Kurd]]ish quarter still existed in the town during the early period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharon|2003|p=297}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] retook the city soon after. [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], brought from England to settle the dangerous feuding between [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and [[Hospitallers]], whose rivalry imperiled the treaty guaranteeing regional stability stipulated with the Egyptian [[Sultan]] [[As-Salih Ayyub]], managed to impose peace on the area. But soon after his departure, feuding broke out and in 1241 the Templars mounted a damaging raid on what was, by now, Muslim Hebron, in violation of agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1965c|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1244, the [[Mongol raids into Palestine|Kharesmians]] destroyed the town, but left the sanctuary untouched.&lt;ref name="Salaville 1910 185"/&gt; In 1260, after [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] [[Sultan]] [[Baibars]] defeated the Mongol army, the [[minaret]]s were built onto the sanctuary. Six years later, while on pilgrimage to Hebron, Baibars promulgated an edict forbidding Christians and Jews from entering the sanctuary,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Micheau|2006|p=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the climate became less tolerant of Jews and Christians than it had been under the prior [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] rule.  The edict for the exclusion of Christians and Jews was not strictly enforced until the middle of the 14th-century and by 1490, not even Muslims were permitted to enter the underground caverns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy-O'Connor|1998|p=274}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mill at [[Artas, Bethlehem|Artas]] was built in 1307 where the profits from its income were dedicated to the Hospital in Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharon|1997|pp=117–18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1318–20, the [[Na'ib]] of [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and much of coastal and interior Palestine ordered the construction of [[al-Jawali Mosque|Jawli Mosque]] to enlarge the prayer space for worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Dandis, Wala.

Hebron was visited by some important rabbis over the next two centuries, among them [[Nachmanides]] (1270) and [[Ishtori Haparchi|Ishtori HaParchi]] (1322) who noted the [[Old Jewish cemetery, Hebron|old Jewish cemetery]] there. Sunni imam [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] (1292–1350) was penalised by the religious authorities in Damascus for refusing to recognise Hebron as a Muslim pilgrimage site, a view also held by his teacher [[Ibn Taymiyyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meri|2004|pp=362–63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian traveller, Meshulam of [[Volterra]] (1481) found not more that twenty Jewish families living in Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kosover|1966|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|David|2010|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and recounted how the Jewish women of Hebron would disguise themselves with a veil in order to pass as Muslim women and enter the Cave of the Patriarchs without being recognized as Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamdan|2000|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minute descriptions of Hebron were recorded in Stephen von Gumpenberg’s Journal (1449), by [[Felix Fabri]] (1483) and by [[Mejr ed-Din]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Smith|1856|pp=440–42, n.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this period, also, that the [[Mamluk]] Sultan [[Qaitbay|Qa'it Bay]] revived the old custom of the Hebron "table of Abraham," and exported it as a model for his own ''[[madrasa]]'' in [[Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singer|2002|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became an immense charitable establishment near the [[Haram]], distributing daily some 1,200 loaves of bread to travellers of all faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Smith|1856|p=458}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian rabbi [[Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura]] writing of Machpelah around 1490 wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;'I was in the Cave of Machpelah, over which the mosque has been built; and the Arabs hold the place in high honour. All the Kings of the Arabs come here to repeat their prayers, but neither a Jew nor an Arab may enter the Cave itself, where the real graves of the Patriarchs are; the Arabs remain above, and let down burning torches into it through a window, for they keep a light always burning there. . Bread and lentil, or some other kind of pulse (seeds of peas or beans), is distributed (by the Muslims) to the poor every day without distinction of faith, and this is done in honour of Abraham.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berger|2011|p=246.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early Ottoman rule===
[[File:Hebron - Roberts 1839.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hebron in 1839, after a drawing by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]]]]

The expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]] along the southern Mediterranean coast under sultan [[Selim I]] coincided with the establishment of [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] commissions by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] in Spain, which ended centuries of the Iberian ''convivencia'' (coexistence). The ensuing [[Alhambra Decree|expulsions of the Jews]] drove many [[Sephardi Jews]] into the Ottoman provinces, and a slow influx of Jews to the Holy Land took place, with some notable Sephardi [[Kabbalah|kabbalists]] settling in Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Idel|2005|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2007|pp=xv–xix}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following two centuries, there was a significant migration of Bedouin tribal groups from the Arabian Peninsula into Palestine. Many settled in three separate villages in the Wādī al Khalīl, and their descendants later formed the majority of Hebron.&lt;ref name="Büssow 2011 195"&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish community fluctuated between 8–10 families throughout the 16th century, and suffered from severe financial straits in the first half of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|David|2010|p=24}}. Tahrir registers document 20 households in 1538/9, 8 in 1553/4, 11 in 1562 and 1596/7. Gil however suggests the tahrir records of the Jewish population may be understated.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1540, renowned [[kabbalist]] [[Malkiel Ashkenazi]] bought a courtyard from the small [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] community, in which he established the Sephardi [[Abraham Avinu Synagogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|1850|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1659, Abraham Pereyra of Amsterdam founded the ''Hesed Le'Abraham [[yeshiva]]'' in Hebron which attracted many students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perera|1996|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 18th century, the Jewish community suffered from heavy debts, almost quadrupling from 1717–1729,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnay|1992|pp=89–90}} gives the figures of 12,000 quadrupling to 46,000 [[Kuruş]].&lt;/ref&gt; and were "almost crushed" from the extortion practiced by the Turkish pashas. In 1773 or 1775, a large/substantial amount of money was extorted from the Jewish community, who paid up to avert a threatened catastrophe, after a false allegation was made accusing them of having murdered the son of a local sheikh and throwing his body into a cesspit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Emissaries from the community were frequently  sent overseas to solicit funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marcus|1996|p=85}}. In 1770, they received financial assistance from North American Jews which amounted in excess of £100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Luit|2009|p=42}}. In 1803, the rabbis and elders of the Jewish community were imprisoned after failing to pay their debts. In 1807 the community did however succeed in purchasing a 5-dunam (5,000 m²) plot where Hebron's wholesale market stands today.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Ottoman period, the dilapidated state of the patriarchs' tombs was restored to a semblance of sumptuous dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conder|1830|p=198}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Bey, one of the few foreigners to gain access, reported in 1807 that,&lt;blockquote&gt;'all the sepulchres of the patriarchs are covered with rich carpets of green silk, magnificently embroidered with gold; those of the wives are red, embroidered in like manner. The sultans of Constantinople furnish these carpets, which are renewed from time to time. Ali Bey counted nine, one over the other, upon the sepulchre of Abraham.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conder|1830|p=198}}. The source was a manuscript, ''The Travels of Ali Bey'', vol. ii, pp. 232–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Hebron also became known throughout the Arab world for its glass production, abetted by Bedouin trade networks which brought up minerals from the Dead Sea, and the industry is mentioned in the books of 19th century [[Western culture|Western]] travelers to Palestine. For example, [[Ulrich Jasper Seetzen]] noted during his travels in Palestine in 1808–09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schölch|1993|p=161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; based on 26 kilns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, Robert Sears wrote that Hebron's population of 400 Arab families "manufactured glass lamps, which are exported to [[Egypt]]. Provisions are abundant, and there is a considerable number of shops."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sears|1844|p=260}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early 19th century travellers also remarked on Hebron's flourishing agriculture. Apart from glassware, it was a major exporter of ''dibse'', grape sugar,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|1808|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the famous Dabookeh grapestock characteristic of Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finn|1868|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine|Peasant Arab revolt]] broke out in April 1834 when [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]] announced he would recruit troops from the local Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krämer|2011|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hebron, headed by its [[wikt:Special:Search/nazir|nazir]] Abd ar-Rahman Amr, declined to supply its quota of conscripts for the army and suffered badly from the Egyptian campaign to crush the uprising. The town was invested and when its defences fell on 4 August it was sacked by Ibrahim Pasha's army.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimmerling|Migdal|2003|pp=6–11, esp. p. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Smith|1856|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|1850|p=403}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 500 Muslims from Hebron were killed in the attack and some 750 were conscripted. 120 youths were abducted and put at the disposal of Egyptian army officers. Most of the Muslim population managed to flee beforehand to the hills. Many Jews fled to Jerusalem, but during the general pillage of the town [[1834 Hebron massacre|at least five were killed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|1850|pp=398–99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1838, the total population was estimated at 10,000.&lt;ref name="Robinson 88"/&gt; When the Government of Ibrahim Pasha fell in 1841, the local clan-head Abd ar-Rahman Amr once again resumed the reins of power as the Sheik of Hebron. Due to his extortionate demands for cash from the local population, most of the Jewish population fled to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|1850|pp=398–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846, the Ottoman Governor-in-chief of Jerusalem (''serasker''), [[Kıbrıslı Mehmed Emin Pasha]], waged a campaign to subdue rebellious sheiks in the Hebron area, and while doing so, allowed his troops to sack the town. Though it was widely rumoured that he secretly protected Abd ar-Rahman,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finn|1878|pp=287ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the latter was deported together with other local leaders (such as Muslih al-'Azza of [[Bayt Jibrin]]), but he managed to return to the area in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schölch|1993|pp=234–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Ottoman rule===
[[File:Hebron glass finished products - Joff Williams.jpg|thumb|150px|A display of [[Hebron glass]]]]

By 1850, the Jewish population consisted of 45–60 Sephardi families, some 40 born in the town, and a 30-year-old Ashkenazi community of 50 families, mainly Polish and Russian,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|1850|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1847|pp=355–381, 372}}:The rabbi of the Ashkenazi community, who said they numbered 60 mainly Polish and Russian emigrants, professed no knowledge of the Sephardim in Hebron (p.377).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chabad|Lubavitch Hasidic]] movement having established a community in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sicker|1999|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ascendency of Ibrahim Pasha devastated for a time the local glass industry for, aside from the loss of life, his plan to build a Mediterranean fleet led to severe logging in Hebron's forests, and firewood for the kilns grew rarer. At the same time, Egypt began importing cheap European glass, the rerouting of the hajj from Damascus through Transjordan eliminated Hebron as a staging point, and the Suez canal (1869) dispensed with caravan trade. The consequence was a steady decline in the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|pp=198–99}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the town was divided into four quarters: the Ancient Quarter (''Harat al-Kadim'') near the Cave of Machpelah; to its south, the Quarter of the Silk Merchant (''Harat al-Kazaz''), inhabited by Jews; the Mameluke-era Sheikh's Quarter (''Harat ash Sheikh'') to the north-west;and further north, the Dense Quarter (''Harat al-Harbah'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1847|p=379}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1881|p=195}} mentions a different set of names, the Quarter of the Cloister Gate (''Harat Bab ez Zawiyeh'');the Quarter of the Sanctuary (''Haret el Haram''), to the south-east.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, the newly appointed Ottoman ''[[pasha]]'' ("governor") of the ''[[sanjak]]'' ("district") of Jerusalem, [[Kıbrıslı Mehmed Kamil Pasha|Kamil Pasha]], attempted to subdue the rebellion in the Hebron region. Kamil and his army marched towards Hebron in July 1855, with representatives from the English, French and other Western consulates as witnesses. After crushing all opposition, Kamil appointed Salama Amr, the brother and strong rival of Abd al Rachman, as ''[[wikt:Special:Search/nazir|nazir]]'' of the Hebron region. After this relative quiet reigned in the town for the next 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schölch|1993|pp=236–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finn|1878|pp=305–308}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian Jews of the [[Karlin (Hasidic Dynasty)|Karlin Hasidic court]] settled in another part of the city in 1866.&lt;ref name="Shragai 2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Shragai|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nadav Shragai]] Arab-Jewish relations were good, and Alter Rivlin, who spoke Arabic and Syrian-Aramaic, was appointed Jewish representative to the city council.&lt;ref name="Shragai 2008"/&gt; Hebron suffered from a severe drought during 1869–71 and food sold for ten times the normal value.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7xrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22with+a+severe+drought.+Food+was+so+%22&amp;dq=%22with+a+severe+drought.+Food+was+so+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pBOZUNWxM6aP4gSS7oAg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA History of the Jews of the Netherlands Antilles, Volume 2], Isaac Samuel Emmanuel, Suzanne A. Emmanuel, American Jewish Archives, 1970. p. 754: "Between 1869 and 1871 Hebron was plagued with a severe drought. Food was so scarce that the little available sold for ten times the normal value. Although the rains came in 1871, there was no easing of the famine, for the farmers had no seed to sow. The [Jewish] community was obliged to borrow money from  non-Jews at exorbitant interest rates in order to buy wheat for their fold. Their leaders finally decided to send their eminent Chief Rabbi Eliau [Soliman] Mani to Egypt to obtain relief."&lt;/ref&gt; From 1874 the Hebron district as part of the Sanjak of Jerusalem was administered directly from [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khalidi|1998|p=218}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the 19th century the production of [[Hebron glass]] declined due to competition from imported European glass-ware, however, the products of Hebron continued to be sold, particularly among the poorer populace and travelling Jewish traders from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schölch|1993|pp=161–62}} quoting David Delpuget ''Les Juifs d´Alexandrie, de Jaffa et de Jérusalem en 1865'', Bordeaux, 1866, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|World Fair of 1873 in Vienna]], Hebron was represented with glass ornaments. A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained an important source of income for Hebron, with four factories earning 60,000 francs yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schölch|1993|pp=161–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the economy of other cities in Palestine was based on solely on trade, Hebron was the only city in Palestine that combined agriculture, livestock herding and trade, including the manufacture of glassware and processing of hides. This was because the most fertile lands were situated within the city limits.&lt;ref name="Taraki Giacaman"&gt;{{harvnb| Tarākī|2006|pp=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city, nevertheless, was considered unproductive and had a reputation "being an asylum for the poor and the spiritual."&lt;ref name="Taraki Giacaman2"&gt;{{harvnb|Tarākī|2006|pp=12–14}}: "Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and well into the twentieth, Hebron was a peripheral, "borderline" community, attracting poor itinerant peasants and those with Sufi inclinations from its environs. The tradition of ''shorabat Sayyidna Ibrahim'', a soup kitchen surviving into the present day and supervised by the ''awqaf'', and that of the Sufi ''zawaya'' gave the city a reputation for being an asylum for the poor and the spiritual, cementing the poor cast of a town supporting the unproductive and the needy (Ju'beh 2003). This reputation was bound to shed a conservative, dull cast on the city, a place not known for high living, dynamism, or innovativeness."&lt;/ref&gt; Differing  in architectural style from Nablus, whose wealthy merchants built handsome houses, Hebron’s main characteristic was its semi-urban, semi-peasant dwellings.&lt;ref name="Taraki Giacaman"/&gt;
[[File:Jewish ghetto in hebron, 1921.jpg|thumb|120px|Jews in Hebron, 1921]]
Hebron was 'deeply Bedouin and Islamic',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimmerling|Migdal|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'bleakly conservative' in its religious outlook,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with a strong tradition of hostility to Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laurens|1999|p=508}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renan|1864|p=93}} remarked of the town that it was 'one of the bulwarks of Semitic ideas, in their most austere form.'&lt;/ref&gt; It had a reputation for religious zeal in jealously protecting its sites from Jews and Christians, but both the Jewish and Christian communities were apparently well integrated into the town's economic life.&lt;ref name="Büssow 2011 195"/&gt; As a result of its commercial decline, tax revenues diminished significantly, and the Ottoman government, avoiding meddling in complex local politics, left Hebron relatively undisturbed, to become 'one of the most autonomous regions in late Ottoman Palestine.'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=199}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish community was under French protection until 1914.  The Jewish presence itself was divided between the traditional Sephardi community, Orthodox and anti-Zionist,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimmerling|Migdal|2003|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whose members spoke Arabic and adopted Arab dress, and the more recent influx of [[Ashkenazis]]. They prayed in different synagogues, sent their children to different schools, lived in different quarters and did not intermarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campos|2007|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British rule ===
[[File:British loyalty meeting in Hebron, 3 July 1940.jpg|thumb|245px|British loyalty meeting in Hebron, July 1940]]

The British occupied Hebron on 8 December 1917. Most of Hebron was owned by old Islamic charitable endowments (''[[waqf]]s''), with about 60% of all the land in and around Hebron belonging to the Tamīm al-Dārī waqf.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kupferschmidt|1987|pp=110–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, its population stood at 17,000.&lt;ref name="CP7fYghBFQC 1936, p. 887"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7CP7fYghBFQC&amp;pg=PA887&amp;dq=al-khalil+jews&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QQqZUJ-qCsKw0QX004GwBw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=al-khalil%20jews&amp;f=false E.

Before his appointment, he had been a staunch opponent of [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Haj Amin]], supported the Muslim National Associations and had good contacts with the Zionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2008|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, al-Khaṭīb became one of the few loyal followers of Haj Amin in Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kupferschmidt|1987|p=82}}: "In any event, after his appointment, Abd al-Hayy al-Khatib not only played a prominent role in the disturbances of 1929, but, in general, appeared as one of the few loyal adherents of Hajj Amin in that town."&lt;/ref&gt; During the late Ottoman period, a new ruling elite had emerged in Palestine. They later formed the core of the growing Arab nationalist movement in the early 20th century. During the Mandate period, delegates from Hebron constituted only 1 per cent of the political leadership.&lt;ref name="Tarākī 2006 12–14"&gt;{{harvnb| Tarākī|2006|pp=12–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinian Arab decision to boycott the 1923 elections for a Legislative Council was made at the [[Palestine Arab Congress|fifth Palestinian Congress]], after it was reported by Murshid Shahin (an Arab pro-zionist activist) that there was intense resistance in Hebron to the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2008|pp=19–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost no house in Hebron remained undamaged when an [[1927 Jericho earthquake|earthquake struck Palestine]] on July 11, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Ben Zion, [http://www.timesofisrael.com/eyeing-nepal-experts-warn-israel-is-unprepared-for-its-own-big-one/ 'Eyeing Nepal, experts warn Israel is unprepared for its own Big One,'] [[The Times of Israel]] 27 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cave of the Patriarchs continued to remain officially closed to non-Muslims, and reports that entry to the site had been relaxed in 1928 were denied by the [[Supreme Muslim Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kupferschmidt|1987|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time following attempts by the [[Lithuania]]n government to draft yeshiva students into the army, the Lithuanian [[Hebron Yeshiva]] (Knesses Yisroel) relocated to Hebron, after consultations between Rabbi [[Nosson Tzvi Finkel (Slabodka)|Nosson Tzvi Finkel]], [[Yechezkel Sarna]] and [[Moshe Mordechai Epstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wein|1993|pp=138–39}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bauman|1994|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1929 had attracted some 265 students from Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krämer|2011|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the Jewish population lived on the outskirts of Hebron along the roads to Be'ersheba and Jerusalem, renting homes owned by Arabs, a number of which were built for the express purpose of housing Jewish tenants, with a few dozen within the city around the synagogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segev|2001|p=318}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1929 Hebron massacre]], Arab rioters slaughtered some 64 to 67 Jewish men, women and children&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimmerling|Migdal|2003|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NyopAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=hebron++ritual+libel&amp;dq=hebron++ritual+libel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cgehUKfDJcfT0QXX2YH4Dg&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCTgK Post-holocaust and anti-semitism – Issues 40–75 – Page 35] Merkaz ha-Yerushalmi le-ʻinyene tsibur u-medinah, Temple University.

The mayor answered: "ln a way you behave like in a war. You don't kill what you want. You kill what you find. Next time they will all be killed, young and old." Later on, Londres spoke again to the mayor and tested him ironically by saying: "You cannot kill all the Jews. There are 150,000 of them." [[Raghib al-Nashashibi|Nashashibi]] answered "in a soft voice, 'Oh no, it'll take two days.”&lt;/ref&gt; and wounded 60, and Jewish homes and synagogues were ransacked; 435 Jews survived by virtue of the shelter and assistance offered them by their Arab neighbours, who hid them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segev|2001|pp=325–26}}: ''The Zionist Archives preserves lists of Jews who were saved by Arabs; one list contains 435 names.''&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hebron Arabs, including Ahmad Rashid al-Hirbawi, president of Hebron chamber of commerce, supported the return of Jews after the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/books/the-tangled-truth The Tangled Truth,  Benny Morris]&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, 35 families moved back into the ruins of the Jewish quarter, but on the eve of the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|Palestinian Arab revolt]] (April 23, 1936) the British Government decided to move the Jewish community out of Hebron as a precautionary measure to secure its safety. The sole exception was the 8th generation Hebronite Ya'akov ben Shalom Ezra, who processed dairy products in the city, blended in well with its social landscape and resided there under the protection of friends. In November 1947, in anticipation of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|UN partition vote]], the Ezra family closed its shop and left the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campos|2007|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yossi Ezra has since tried to regain his family's property through the Israeli courts.&lt;ref name="Levinsohn2011" /&gt;

===Jordanian rule===
At the beginning of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Egypt took control of Hebron. Between May and October, Egypt and Jordan tussled for dominance in Hebron and its environs. Both countries appointed military governors in the town, hoping to gain recognition from Hebron officials. The Egyptians managed to persuade the pro-Jordanian mayor to support their rule, at least superficially, but local opinion turned against them when they imposed taxes. Villagers surrounding Hebron resisted and skirmishes broke out in which some were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1860649890 ''The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews''], Benny Morris – 2003. pp. 186–87.&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1948, part of the Egyptian forces from Bethlehem to Hebron had been cut off from their lines of supply and [[John Bagot Glubb|Glubb Pasha]] sent 350 [[Arab Legion]]naires and an armoured car unit to Hebron to reinforce them there. When the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|Armistice]] was signed, the city thus fell under [[Rule of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|Jordanian military control]]. The armistice agreement between Israel with Jordan intended to allow Israeli Jewish pilgrims to visit Hebron, but, as Jews of all nationalities were forbidden by Jordan into the country, this did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A Idinopulos, Jerusalem, 1994, p. 300, "So severe were the Jordanian restrictions against Jews gaining access to the old city that visitors wishing to cross over from west Jerusalem...had to produce a baptismal certificate."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Karen, Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths, 1997, "Only clergy, diplomats, UN personnel, and a few privileged tourists were permitted to go from one side to the other. The Jordanians required most tourists to produce baptismal certificates—to prove they were not Jewish ... ."&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1948, the [[Jericho Conference]] was convened to decide the future of the West Bank which was held by Jordan.  Hebron notables, headed by mayor [[Muhammad Ali Ja'abari|Muhamad 'Ali al-Ja'bari]], voted in favour of becoming part of [[Jordan]] and to recognise [[Abdullah I of Jordan]] as their king. The subsequent unilateral annexation benefited the Arabs of Hebron, who during the 1950s, played a significant role in the economic development of Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|2004|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=%22and+its+notables+voted+to+become+part+of+that+kingdom+in+1950%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cGKZUIjbA_O00QWY7YHQBA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22and%20its%20notables%20voted%20to%20become%20part%20of%20that%20kingdom%20in%201950%22&amp;f=false ''Cities of The Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia''], Michael Dumper, Bruce E.

Although a significant number of people relocated to Jerusalem from Hebron during the Jordanian period,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J5U3AAAAIAAJ ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam''], Sir H. A. R. Gibb 1980. p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; Hebron itself saw a considerable increase in population with 35,000 settling in the town.&lt;ref name="Efrat 1984 192"&gt;{{harvnb|Efrat|1984|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, signs of the previous Jewish presence in Hebron were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Auerbach|2009|p=79}}: "Under Jordanian rule, the last vestiges of a Jewish historical presence in Hebron were obliterated. The Avraham Avinu synagogue, already in ruins, was razed; a pen for goats, sheep, and donkeys was built on the site."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli occupation===
[[File:Hebron105.JPG|thumb|175px|Constructed in 1893, this former Jewish clinic in central Hebron now forms part of an Israeli neighbourhood.]]

After the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967, Israel occupied Hebron along with the rest of the [[West Bank]], establishing a [[Israeli Military Governorate|military government]] to rule the area. In an attempt to reach a [[land for peace]] deal, [[Yigal Allon]] proposed that Israel annex 45% of the West Bank and return the remainder to Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|pp=80–83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Allon Plan]], the city of Hebron would lie in Jordanian territory, and in order to determine Israel's own border, Allon suggested building a Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|pp=138–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ben-Gurion]] also considered that Hebron was the one sector of the conquered territories that should remain under Jewish control and be open to Jewish settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sternhell|1999|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from its symbolic message to the international community that Israel's rights in Hebron were, according to Jews, inalienable,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sternhell|1999|p=337}}:'In building this new Jewish town, one was sending a message to the international community: for the Jews, the sites connected with Jewish history are inalienable, and if later, for circumstantial reasons, the state of Israel is obliged to give one or another of them up, the step is not considered final.'&lt;/ref&gt; settling Hebron also had theological significance in some quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|p=151}}: 'David's kingdom was a model for the [[Apocalyptic literature|messianic kingdom]]. David began in Hebron, so settling Hebron would lead to final redemption.'&lt;/ref&gt; For some, the capture of Hebron by Israel had unleashed a messianic fervor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segev|2008|p=698}}: "Hebron was considered a holy city; the massacre of Jews there in 1929 was imprinted on [[national memory]] along with the great pogroms of Eastern Europe. The messianic fervor that characterized the Hebron settlers was more powerful than the awakening that led people to settle in East Jerusalem: while Jerusalem had already been annexed, the future of Hebron was still unclear."&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivors and descendants of the prior community are mixed. Some support the project of Jewish redevelopment, others commend living in peace with Hebronite Arabs, while a third group recommend a full pullout.&lt;ref name=jpt&gt;''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''.

Immediately after the 1967 war, mayor al-Ja'bari had unsuccessfully promoted the creation of an autonomous Palestinian entity in the West Bank, and by 1972, he was advocating for a confederal arrangement with Jordan instead. al-Ja'bari nevertheless consistently fostered a conciliatory policy towards Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cxVXAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22with+some+moral+courage,+pursued+a+policy+conciliatory+to+Israel%22&amp;dq=%22with+some+moral+courage,+pursued+a+policy+conciliatory+to+Israel%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EYaiUL6VBuaZ0QWlooCQDQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA The Economist, Volume 242], Charles Reynell, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was ousted by Fahad Qawasimi in the 1976 mayoral election, which marked a shift in support towards pro-PLO nationalist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattar|2005|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheik Farid Khader heads the Ja’bari tribe, consisting of some 35,000 people, which is considered one of the most important tribes in Hebron. For years, members of the Ja'bari tribe were the mayors of Hebron. Khader regularly meets with settlers and Israeli government officials and is a strong opponent of both the concept of Palestinian State and the Palestinian Authority itself.  Khader believes that Jews and Arabs must learn to coexist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=1713 |title='Jewish presence in Hebron is an indisputable historical fact' |publisher=Israel Hayom |date=2011-11-04 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Israeli settlements==
Post-1967 settlement was impelled by theological doctrines developed in the [[Mercaz HaRav Kook]] under both its founder Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], and his son Rabbi [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]], according to which the Land of Israel is holy, the people, endowed with a divine spark, are holy, and that the messianic Age of Redemption has arrived, requiring that the Land and People be united in occupying the land and fulfilling the commandments. Hebron has a particular role in the unfolding 'cosmic drama': traditions hold that Abraham purchased land there, that King David was its king, and the tomb of Abraham covers the entrance to the [[Garden of Eden]], and is a site excavated by Adam, who, with Eve, is buried there. Redemption will occur when the feminine and masculine characteristics of God are united at the site. Settling Hebron is not only a right and duty, but is doing the world at large a favour, with the community's acts an example of the Jews of Hebron being "a light unto the nations" (''Or la-Goyim'') &lt;ref name ="Røislien"&gt;Hanne Eggen Røislien,  [http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/view/14/14  'Living with Contradiction: Examining the Worldview of the Jewish Settlers in Hebron,'] [[International Journal of Conflict and Violence|IJCV]], Vol.1 (2) 2007, pp.169–184, pp.181–182.&lt;/ref&gt; and bringing about their redemption, even if this means breaching secular laws, expressed in religiously motivated violence towards Palestinians, who are widely viewed as "mendacious, vicious, self-centered, and impossible to trust". Clashes with Palestinians in  the settlement project have theological significance in the Jewish Hebron community: the frictions of war were, in Kook's view, conducive to the messianic process, and 'Arabs' will have to leave. There is no kin connection between the new settlers and the traditional Old Families of Jewish Hebronites, who vigorously oppose the new settler presence in Hebron.&lt;ref name ="Røislien"/&gt; According to a ruling given by the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] in 2011, Jews have no right to properties they possessed in places like Hebron and Tel Rumeida before 1948, and have no right to compensation for their losses.&lt;ref name =Levinsohn2011&gt;Chaim Levinsohn, [http://www.haaretz.com/israel-supreme-court-rules-hebron-jews-can-t-reclaim-lands-lost-after-1948-1.344090 'Israel Supreme Court Rules Hebron Jews Can't Reclaim Lands Lost After 1948 ,'] [[Haaretz]] 18 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First settlement, Kiryat Arba ===
In the spring of 1968, Rabbi [[Moshe Levinger]], together with a group of Israelis posing as Swiss tourists, rented from its owner [[Qawasameh tribe|Faiz Qawasmeh]] &lt;ref&gt;Ami Pedahzur, Arie Perliger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DF03xwLaPucC&amp;pg=PA69 ''Jewish Terrorism in Israel,''] Columbia University Press, 2011 p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; the main hotel in Hebron&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then refused to leave. The [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor government]]'s survival depended on the [[religious Zionism]]-associated [[National Religious Party]] and was, under pressure of this party, reluctant to evacuate the settlers. Defence Minister [[Moshe Dayan]] ordered their evacuation but agreed to their relocation to the nearby military base on the eastern outskirts of Hebron which was to become the settlement [[Kiryat Arba]].&lt;ref name=AIC_2004_10-12&gt;[http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/opt_prot_aic_hebron_dec_2004.pdf ''Occupation in Hebron''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105174717/http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/opt_prot_aic_hebron_dec_2004.pdf |date=2016-01-05 }}, pp. 10–12. Alternative Information Center, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; After heavy lobbying by Levinger, the settlement gained the tacit support of [[Levi Eshkol]] and [[Yigal Allon]], while it was opposed by [[Abba Eban]] and [[Pinhas Sapir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|pp=137, 144, 150, 205}}&lt;/ref&gt; After more than a year and a half, the government agreed to legitimize the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|pp=205, 359}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement was later expanded with the nearby [[Israeli outpost|outpost]] Givat Ha’avot, north of the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]].&lt;ref name=AIC_2004_10-12/&gt; 
Much of the Hebron-Kiryat Arba operation was planned and financed by the [[Movement for Greater Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lustick|1988|p=205 n.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beit Hadassah ===
Originally named Hesed l'Avraham clinic, Beit Hadassah was constructed in 1893 with donations of Jewish [[Baghdad]]i families and was the only modern facility in Hebron. In 1909, it was renamed after [[Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America]] which took responsibility for the medical staff and provided free medical care to all.&lt;ref name = HebronJews/&gt;

In 1979, a group of settlers led by Miriam Levinger moved into the Dabouia, the former [[Hadassah Medical Center|Hadassah Hospital]] in central Hebron, then under Arab administration. They turned it into a bridgehead for Jewish resettlement inside Hebron,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perera|1996|pp=178}}: 'As I made my way to the Machpelah, I passed a curious scene. The Hadassah hospital of Hebron, which is Arab-administered, had been taken over by Israeli women of Kiryat Arba, the new settlement on the hill overlooking the city. Miriam Levinger, wife of Moshe Levinger, the militant right-wing rabbi who founded Kiryat Arba, was screaming in her Brooklyn-accented Hebrew at the Palestinian police, who were – very politely – attempting to remove the women from the hospital grounds.'&lt;/ref&gt; and founded the [[Committee of The Jewish Community of Hebron]] near the Abraham Avinu Synagogue. The take-over created severe conflict with Arab shopkeepers in the same area, who appealed twice to the Israeli Supreme Court, without success.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kretzmer|2002|pp=117–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this precedent, in February of the following year, the Government legitimized residency in the city of Hebron proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Falah|1985|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern of settlement followed by an outbreak of hostilities with local Palestinians was repeated later at Tel Rumeida.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bouckaert|2001|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beit Romano ===
Beit Romano was built and owned by Yisrael Avraham Romano of Constantinople and served Sephardi Jews from Turkey. In 1901, a Yeshiva was established there with a dozen teachers and up to 60 students.&lt;ref name = HebronJews&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auerbach|first1=Jerold S.|title=Hebron Jews memory and conflict in the land of Israel|date=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9780742566170|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ooUqc8snyZUC&amp;pg=PA60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Israeli authorities took over a Palestinian education office (Osama Ben Munqez School) and the adjacent bus station. The school was turned into a settlement, and the bus station into a military base against an order of the Israeli Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=AIC_2004_10-12/&gt;

=== Tel Rumeida ===
In 1807 the immigrant Sephardic Rabbi Haim Yeshua Hamitzri (Haim the Jewish Egyptian) purchased 5 dunams on the outskirts of the city and in 1811 he signed a contract for a 99-year lease on a further  800 dunams of land, which included 4 plots in [[Tel Rumeida]]. The plots were administered by his descendant Haim Bajaio after Jews left Hebron. Settlers' claims to this land are based on these precedents, but are dismissed by the rabbi's heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Platt|2012|pp=79–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, settlers established a caravan outpost there called (''Ramat Yeshai''). In 1998, the Government recognized it as a settlement, and in 2001 the Defence Minister approved the building of the first housing units.&lt;ref name=AIC_2004_10-12/&gt;

=== Avraham Avinu ===
[[File:Abraham Avinu Synagogue, Hebron.jpg|thumb|Abraham Avinu Synagogue in 1925]]
The [[Abraham Avinu Synagogue]] was the physical and spiritual center of its neighborhood and regarded as one of the most beautiful synagogues in Palestine. It was the centre of Jewish worship in Hebron until it was burnt down in 1929. In 1948 under Jordanian rule, the remaining ruins were razed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auerbach|first1=Jerold S.|title=Hebron Jews memory and conflict in the land of Israel|date=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9780742566170|pages=40, 45, 79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ooUqc8snyZUC&amp;pg=PA79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Avraham Avinu quarter was established next to the Vegetable and Wholesale Markets on [[Al-Shuhada Street]] in the south of the Old City. The vegetable market was closed by the Israeli military and some of the neighbouring houses were occupied by settlers and soldiers. Settlers started to take over the closed Palestinian stores, despite explicit orders of the Israeli Supreme Court that the settlers should vacate these stores and the Palestinians should be allowed to return.&lt;ref name=AIC_2004_10-12/&gt;

=== Further settlement activities ===
In 2012, Israel Defense Forces called for the immediate removal of a new settlement, because it was seen as a provocation.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Chaim. [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/idf-brass-calls-for-immediate-removal-of-new-hebron-settlement-1.422007 "IDF brass calls for immediate removal of new Hebron settlement."] ''Haaretz Newspaper''. 2 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF has enforced settler demands against the flying of Palestinian flags on a Hebronite rooftop contiguous to settlements, though no rule forbids the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Levinson, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.580203 'Following settlers' demand, IDF removes Palestinian flag from Hebron roof,'] [[Haaretz]], March 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, Israel announced its intention to allow settlement building in the military compound of ''Plugat Hamitkanim'' in Hebron, which had been confiscated for military purposes in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=772789 'Watchdog: Expansion of Hebron settlements amounts to ‘right of return for Jews only,'] [[Ma'an News Agency]] 22 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
In 1820, it was reported that there were about 1,000 Jews in Hebron,&lt;ref name="Turnerp261"&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|1820|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, Hebron had an estimated 1,500 taxable Muslim households, in addition to 41 Jewish tax-payers. Taxpayers consisted here of male heads of households who owned even a very small shop or piece of land. 200 Jews and one Christian household were under 'European protections'. The total population was estimated at 10,000.&lt;ref name="Robinson 88"/&gt; In 1842, it was estimated that about 400 Arab and 120 Jewish families lived in Hebron, the latter having been diminished in number following the destruction of 1834.&lt;ref name="PackardUnion1842"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederick Adolphus Packard|author2=American Sunday-School Union|title=The Union Bible Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qAaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA304|year=1842|publisher=American Sunday-School Union|page=304|quote=About four hundred families of Arabs dwell in Hebron, and about one hundred and twenty families of Jews; the latter having been greatly reduced in number by a bloody battle in 1834, between them and the troops of Ibrahim Pasha.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban development==
[[File:Hebron City-1.jpg|thumb|250px|View of Hebron 2006]]

Historically, the city consisted of four densely populated quarters: the ''suq'' and ''Harat al-Masharqa'' adjacent to the Ibrahimi mosque, the silk merchant quarter (''Haret Kheitun'') to the south and the Sheikh quarter (''Haret al-Sheikh'') to the north. It is believed the basic urban structure of the city had been established by the Mamluk period, during which time the city also had Jewish, Christian and Kurdish quarters.&lt;ref name="De Cesari 2009 235–236"&gt;{{harvnb|De Cesari|2009|pp=235–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 19th-century, Hebron was still divided into four quarters, but the Christian quarter had disappeared.&lt;ref name="De Cesari 2009 235–236"/&gt; The sections included the ancient quarter surrounding the cave of Machpelah, the ''Haret Kheitun'' (the Jewish quarter, ''Haret el-Yahud''), the ''Haret el-Sheikh'' and the [[Druze]] quarter.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m8Rx2bSALkAC&amp;pg=PA395&amp;dq=al-khalil+jews&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KhqZUL-IHMq90QXguICoCQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBDgo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Journal of a deputation sent to the East by the committee of the Malta Protestant college, in 1849: containing an account of the present state of the Oriental nations, including their religion, learning, education, customs, and occupations, Volume 2], J. Nisbet and co., 1854. p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Hebron's population gradually increased, inhabitants preferred to build upwards rather than leave the safety of their neighbourhoods. By the 1880s, better security provided by the Ottoman authorities allowed the town to expand and a new commercial centre, ''Bab el-Zawiye'', emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; As development continued, new spacious and taller structures were built to the north-west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Efrat|1984|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, the town consisted of dense clusters of residential dwellings along the valley, rising onto the slopes above it.&lt;ref name="Kedar 2000 112–113"&gt;{{harvnb|Kedar|2000|pp=112–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1920s, the town was made up of seven quarters: ''el-Sheikh'' and ''Bab el-Zawiye'' to the west, ''el-Kazzazin'', ''el-Akkabi'' and ''el-Haram'' in the centre, ''el-Musharika'' to the south and ''el-Kheitun'' in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brill|1993|p=887}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Urban sprawl had spread onto the surrounding hills by 1945.&lt;ref name="Kedar 2000 112–113"/&gt; The large population increase under Jordanian rule resulted in about 1,800 new houses being built, most of them along the Hebron-Jerusalem highway, stretching northwards for over {{convert|3|mi|0|abbr=out}} at a depth of 600&amp;nbsp;ft (200m) either way. Some 500 houses were built elsewhere on surrounding rural land. There was less development to the south-east, where housing units extended along the valley for about 1 mile (1.5&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="Efrat 1984 192"/&gt;

In 1971, with the assistance of the Israeli and Jordanian governments, the [[Hebron University]], an Islamic university, was founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hebron.edu/en/about-hu/hu-founder.html About Founder of Hebron University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016234433/http://www.hebron.edu/en/about-hu/hu-founder.html |date=2012-10-16 }}, Hebron University, 2010–2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A ghetto state of ghettos: Palestinians under Israeli citizenship'', Mary Boger, City University of New York. Sociology – 2008. p. 93: "The development of the Islamic Movement in Israel owes much to the Israeli and Jordanian governments who collaborated to establish an Islamic University in al-Khalil (Hebron), headed by Shaykh Muhammad Ali al-Ja'bari a prominent anti-PLO leader who served as minister in Jordan and in the internal circle of kings Abd-allah and Husayn, who are known to have befriended the Israeli occupation."&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to enhance the view of the Ibrahami Mosque, Jordan demolished whole blocks of ancient houses opposite its entrance, which also resulted in improved access to the historic site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ricca|2007|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jordanians also demolished the old synagogue located in the el-Kazzazin quarter. In 1976, Israel recovered the site which had been converted into an animal pen, and by 1989, a settler courtyard had been established there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Auerbach|2009|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hebronmarket.jpg|thumb|right|Hebron market]]
Today, the area along the north-south axis to the east comprises the modern town of Hebron (also called Upper Hebron, ''Khalil Foq''). It was established towards the end of the Ottoman period, its inhabitants being upper and middle class Hebronites who from there from the crowded old city, ''Balde al-Qadime'' (also called Lower Hebron, ''Khalil Takht'').&lt;ref name="De Cesari 2009 230–233"&gt;{{harvnb|De Cesari|2009|pp=230–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern part of Upper Hebron includes some up-scale residential  districts and also houses the Hebron University, private hospitals and the only two hotels in the city. The main commercial artery of the city is located here, situated along the Jerusalem Road, and includes modern multi-storey shopping malls. Also in this area are villas and apartment complexes built on the ''krum'', rural lands and vineyards, which used to function as recreation areas during the summer months until the early Jordanian period.&lt;ref name="De Cesari 2009 230–233"/&gt; The southern part is where the working-class neighbourhoods are located, along with large industrial zones and the Hebron Polytechnic University.&lt;ref name="De Cesari 2009 230–233"/&gt;

The main municipal and governmental buildings are located in the centre of the city. This area includes high-rise concrete and glass developments and also some distinct Ottoman era one-storey family houses, adorned with arched entrances, decorative motifs and ironwork. Hebron's domestic appliance and textile markets are located here along two parallel roads which lead to the entrance of the old city.&lt;ref name="De Cesari 2009 230–233"/&gt;  Many of these have been relocated from the old commercial centre of the city, known as the vegetable market (''hesbe''), which was closed down by the Israeli military during the 1990s. The vegetable market is now located in the square of ''Bab el-Zawiye''.&lt;ref name="De Cesari 2009 230–233"/&gt;

==Shoe industry==
From the 1970s to the early 1990s, a third of those who lived in the city worked in the shoe industry. According to the shoe factory owner Tareq Abu Felat, the number reached least 35,000 people and there were more than 1,000 workshops around the city.&lt;ref name="AJShoe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2015/03/decline-hebron-shoe-industry-150302125843692.html|title=The decline of Hebron's shoe industry|work=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics from the Chamber of Commerce in Hebron put the figure at 40,000 people employed in 1,200 shoe businesses.&lt;ref name="AMShoe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ru/originals/2013/03/palestinian-industry-suffers-cheap-imports.htm|title=The decline of Hebron's shoe industry|work=[[Al Monitor]]|date=13 March 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]] and 1994 [[Protocol on Economic Relations]] between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) made it possible to mass import Chinese goods as the Palestinian National Authority, which was created after the Oslo Accords, did not regulate it. They later put import taxes but the Abu Felat, who also is the Palestinian Federation of Leather Industries's chairman, said more is still needed.&lt;ref name="AJShoe"/&gt; The Palestinian government decided to impose an additional tax of 35% on products from China from April 2013.&lt;ref name="AMShoe"/&gt;

90% of the shoes in Palestine are now estimated to come from China, which Palestinian industry workers say are of much lower quality but also much cheaper,&lt;ref name="AJShoe"/&gt; and the Chinese are more aesthetic. Another factor contributing to the decline of the local industry is Israeli restrictions on Palestinian exports.&lt;ref name="AMShoe"/&gt;

Today, there are less than 300 workshops in the shoe industry, who only run part-time, and they employ around 3,000–4,000 people. More than 50% of the shoes are exported to Israel, where consumers have a better economy. Less than 25% goes to the Palestinian market, with some going to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.&lt;ref name="AJShoe"/&gt;

==Political status==
[[File:Hebron redeployment 1997.jpg|thumbnail|Map of Hebron showing Palestinian controlled H1 and Israeli controlled H2.]]
Under the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] passed by the UN in 1947, Hebron was envisaged to become part of an Arab state. While the Jewish leaders accepted the partition plan, the Arab leadership (the [[Arab Higher Committee]] in Palestine and the [[Arab League]]) rejected it, opposing any partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Palestinian refugees in Jordan 1948–1957|last=Plascov|first=Avi|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7146-3120-2|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=daLPXTYcoewC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jerusalem question, 1917–1968|last=Bovis|first=H.

Following the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel occupied Hebron. In 1997, in accordance with the [[Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron|Hebron Agreement]], Israel withdrew from 80 per cent of Hebron which was handed over to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian police would assume responsibilities in Area H1 and Israel would retain control in Area H2.

An international unarmed observer force—the [[Temporary International Presence in Hebron]] (TIPH) was subsequently established to help the normalization of the situation and to maintain a buffer between the Palestinian Arab population of the city and the Jewish population residing in their enclave in the old city.

==Intercommunal violence==
{{Main article|Israeli–Palestinian conflict in Hebron}}
Hebron was the one city excluded from the interim agreement of September 1995 to restore rule over all Palestinian West Bank cities to the [[Palestinian Authority]].&lt;ref name="Kimmerling 2003 443"/&gt; Since The [[Oslo Agreement]], violent episodes have been recurrent in the city. The [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]] took place on February 25, 1994 when [[Baruch Goldstein]], an Israeli physician and resident of [[Kiryat Arba]], opened fire on Muslims at prayer in the [[Ibrahimi Mosque]], killing 29, and wounding 125 before the survivors overcame and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;Nabeel Abraham,  [http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/articles/article0002775.html What About The Victims?], Lies of Our Times, May 1994, pp 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Standing orders for Israeli soldiers on duty in Hebron disallowed them from firing on fellow Jews, even if they were shooting Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bovard|2004|p=265}}.Meir Tayar, commander of the Hebron Border Police at the time testified that, 'Instructions are to take cover, wait until the clip is empty or the gun jams and then overpower him. Even if I had been there (in the mosque), I could not have done anything-there were special orders.'&lt;/ref&gt; This event was condemned by the Israeli Government, and the extreme right-wing [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] party was banned as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Commission of Inquiry|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli government also tightened restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in H2, closed their vegetable and meat markets, and banned Palestinian cars on Al-Shuhada Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freedland|2012|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The park near the Cave of the Patriarchs for recreation and barbecues is off-limits for Arab Hebronites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the period of the [[First Intifada]] and [[Second Intifada]], the Jewish community was subjected to attacks by Palestinian militants, especially during the periods of the intifadas; which saw 3 fatal stabbings and 9 fatal shootings in between the first and [[second Intifada]] (0.9% of all fatalities in Israel and the West Bank) and 17 fatal shootings (9 soldiers and 8 settlers) and 2 fatalities from a bombing during the second Intifada,&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Palestinian+terror+before+2000/Fatal+Terrorist+Attacks+in+Israel+Since+the+DOP+-S.htm|title=Fatal Terrorist Attacks in Israel Since the DOP (Sep. 1993)|date=24 September 2000|accessdate=2007-04-13|publisher=[[Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thousands of rounds fired on it from the hills above the Abu-Sneina and Harat al-Sheikh neighbourhoods. 12 Israeli soldiers were killed (Hebron Brigade commander Colonel Dror Weinberg and two other officers, 6 soldiers and 3 members of the security unit of Kiryat Arba) in an ambush.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harel|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two [[Temporary International Presence in Hebron]] observers were killed by Palestinian gunmen in a shooting attack on the road to Hebron&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200203/s514316.htm Two Norwegian observers killed near Hebron: Israeli TV], ABC News online, March 27, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Published: 7:31PM GMT 26 Mar 2002 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1388887/Two-Norwegian-observers-killed-near-Hebron.html |title=Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2002-03-26 |accessdate=2009-11-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiph.org/en/News/?module=Articles;action=Article.publicShow;ID=1579 Two TIPH members killed near Hebron], Temporary International Presence in the City of Hebron website, March 27, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 27, 2001, a Palestinian sniper targeted and killed the Jewish baby [[Murder of Shalhevet Pass|Shalhevet Pass]].

In the 1980s Hebron, became the center of the [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] movement, a designated terrorist organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cordesman|2006|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whose first operations started there, and provided a model for similar behaviour in other settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedahzur|Perliger|2011|p=92}}:Cf.'the most palpable expressions of Kahanism in recent decades can be found in Hebron' p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Hebron is one of the three West Bank towns from where the majority of suicide bombers originate. In May 2003, three students of the Hebron Polytechnic University carried out three separate suicide attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0199297975 Making Sense of Suicide Missions], Diego Gambetta – 2006. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2003, in what both Islamic groups described as a retaliation, a 29-year-old preacher from Hebron, Raed Abdel-Hamed Mesk, broke a unilateral Palestinian ceasefire by killing 23 and injured over 130 in a [[Shmuel HaNavi bus bombing|bus bombing]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Chris McGreal,  [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/20/israel1 'Palestinian suicide bomber kills 20 and shatters peace process,']  [[The Guardian]] 20 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ed O'Loughlin, [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/20/1061368359339.html 'Ceasefire illusion just blown away,'] [[Sydney Morning Herald]] 21 August 2003. Hamas claimed it marked the anniversary of [[Denis Michael Rohan]]'s attempt to burn the Al-Aqsa mosque. Islamic Jihad claimed it was in revenge for the killing of a leader, Ahmed Sidr, in Hebron.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli organization [[B'Tselem]] states that there have been "grave violations" of Palestinian human rights in Hebron because of the "presence of the settlers within the city." The organization cites regular incidents of "almost daily physical violence and property damage by settlers in the city", curfews and restrictions of movement that are "among the harshest in the Occupied Territories", and violence by Israeli border policemen and the IDF against Palestinians who live in the city's H2 sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btselem.org/English/Publications/Summaries/200308_Hebron_Area_H2.asp |title=Hebron, Area H-2: Settlements Cause Mass Departure of Palestinians }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/04/11/isrlpa241.htm |title=Mounting Human Rights Crisis in Hebron}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=331234&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y |title=Israeli human rights group slams Hebron settlers}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Human Rights Watch]], Palestinian areas of Hebron are frequently subject to indiscriminate firing by the IDF, leading to many casualties.&lt;ref name="HRW-storm"&gt;{{harvnb|Bouckaert|2001|pp=5, 40–43, 48, 71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; One former IDF soldier, with experience in policing Hebron, has testified to [[Breaking the Silence (non-governmental organization)|Breaking the Silence]], that on the briefing wall of his unit a sign describing their mission aim was hung that read: "To disrupt the routine of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freedland|2012|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hebron mayor [[Mustafa Abdel Nabi]] invited the [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]] to assist the local Palestinian community in opposition to what they describe as Israeli military occupation, collective punishment, settler harassment, home demolitions and land confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.org/publications/history.php |title=History/Mission of CPT |work=Christian Peacemaker Teams |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011002839/http://cpt.org/publications/history.php |archivedate=2008-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A violent episode occurred on 2 May 1980, when 6 yeshiva students died, on the way home from Sabbath prayer at the Tomb of the Patriarchs, in a grenade and firearm attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1985|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event provided a major motivation for settlers near Hebron to join the [[Jewish Underground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feige|2009|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 26, 1983, Israeli settlers attacked the Islamic University and shot three people dead and injured over thirty others.&lt;ref&gt;''Without Prejudice: The Eaford International Review of Racial Discrimination.'' International Organization for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination – 1987. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 [[Shamgar Commission]] of Inquiry concluded that Israeli authorities had consistently failed to investigate or prosecute crimes committed by settlers against Palestinians. Hebron IDF commander Noam Tivon said that his foremost concern is to "ensure the security of the Jewish settlers" and that Israeli "soldiers have acted with the utmost restraint and have not initiated any shooting attacks or violence."&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/62288539.html?dids=62288539:62288539&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+6%2C+2000&amp;author=MARGOT+DUDKEVITCH&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=03.A&amp;desc=IDF%3A+Palestinians+offer+%242%2C000+for+%27martyrs%27] Jerusalem Post, October 6, 2000 "IDF: Palestinians offer $2,000 for 'martyrs'"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic sites==
[[File:Russian Orthodox Monastery in Hebron.jpg|thumb|175px|The Russian Orthodox monastery, Hebron]]
The Old Town of Hebron was a declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] on 7 July 2017,&lt;ref name="OldTownofHebron"&gt;{{cite news |last=Adamczyk |first=Ed |coauthors= |title=UNESCO declares Hebron, West Bank, a world heritage site |work= |pages= |language=English |publisher=UPI |date=7 July 2017 |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/07/07/UNESCO-declares-Hebron-West-Bank-a-world-heritage-site/3011499431429/ |accessdate=7 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but caused outrage by Israeli officials when the World Heritage Committee declared it a Palestinian World Heritage Site instead of an Israeli or Jewish one.&lt;ref name="ABC UNESCO"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/unesco-puts-city-hebron-heritage-danger-list-48495103 | title=Israelis outraged by UNESCO decision on Hebron holy site | publisher=ABC News | work=Associated Press | date=7 July 2017 | accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous historic site in Hebron is the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]]. The [[Herodian architecture|Herodian era structure]] is said to enclose the tombs of the biblical [[Patriarchs]] and [[Matriarchs (Bible)|Matriarchs]]. The Isaac Hall now serves as the Ibrahimi mosque, while the Abraham and Jacob Hall serve as a synagogue. The tombs of other biblical figures ([[Abner|Abner ben Ner]], [[Othniel|Otniel ben Kenaz]], [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] and [[Jesse]]) are also located in the city.

The [[Oak of Sibta]] (Oak of Abraham) is an ancient tree which, in non-Jewish tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finn|1868|p=184}}:'the great oak of Sibta, commonly called Abraham’s oak by most people except the Jews, who do not believe in any Abraham’s oak there. The great patriarch planted, indeed, a grove at Beersheba; but the “Eloné Mamre” they declare to have been “plains,” not “oaks,” (which would be Alloné Mamre,) and to have been situated northwards instead of westwards from the present Hebron.'&lt;/ref&gt; is said to mark the place where Abraham pitched his tent. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] owns the site and the nearby [[Abraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery]], consecrated in 1925.

Hebron is one of the few cities to have preserved its [[Mamluk architecture]]. Many structures were built during the period, especially Sufi [[Zawiya (institution)|zawiya]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bqMVAQAAIAAJ Pilgrimage, sciences and Sufism: Islamic art in the West Bank and Gaza], Museum With No Frontiers – 2004. p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Mosques from the era include the [[Sheikh Ali al-Bakka Mosque|Sheikh Ali al-Bakka]] and [[Al-Jawali Mosque|Al-Jawali]] mosque. The early Ottoman [[Abraham Avinu Synagogue]] in the city's historic Jewish quarter was built in 1540 and restored in 1738.

==Religious traditions==
Some Jewish traditions regarding [[Adam]] place him in Hebron after his expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]. Another has [[Cain]] kill [[Abel]] there. A third has [[Adam and Eve]] buried in the cave of Machpelah. A Jewish-Christian tradition had it that Adam was formed from the red clay of the field of Damascus, near Hebron.&lt;ref name="Vilnay 1973 170–172"&gt;{{harvnb|Vilnay|1973|pp=170–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bSpJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=hebron+%22red+earth%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8_eYUIOJKaHK0QWqyIDQCA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hebron%20%22red%20earth%22&amp;f=false Miscellanies of divinitie: divided into three books] Edward Kellet, 1633. p. 223: "Sixthly, the field of Damascus, where the red earth lieth, of which they report Adam was formed; which earth is tough, and may be wrought like wax, and lieth close by Hebron."&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Ages, pilgrims and the inhabitants of Hebron would eat the red earth as a charm against misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y7w7TW4NVBcC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=pilgrim+hebron+red&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-_SYUP-jDYHU0QWQ3ICgCA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Fortress of the Raven: Karak in the Middle Islamic Period (1100 -1650)], Marcus Milwright, BRILL, 2008.  p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7jz-6wHrg2QC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=%22In+the+Middle+Ages+Christian+pilgrims+here+ate+the+red+earth+of+which+he+was+made%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nWeWUKjYDbSN0wWq-IHIBQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Religions Or Faiths of Man, Part 2], J.

In [[History of Christianity#Early Middle Ages (476–799)|medieval Christian]] tradition, Hebron was one of the three cities where [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]] lived. It is thus possibly the birthplace of [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Craveri|1967|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milman|1840|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One Islamic tradition has it that the Prophet alighted in Hebron during his [[Isra and Mi'raj|night journey]] from Mecca to Jerusalem, and the mosque in the city is said to conserve one of his shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another tradition states that the prophet Muhammad arranged for Hebron and its surrounding villages to become part of [[Tamim al-Dari]]'s domain; this was implemented during [[Umar]]'s reign as caliph. According to the arrangement, al-Dari and his descendants were only permitted to tax the residents for their land and the ''[[waqf]]'' of the Ibrahimi Mosque was entrusted to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levi della Vida|1993|p=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''simat al-Khalil'' or "Table of Abraham" is attested to in the writings of the 11th century [[Persian people|Persian]] traveller [[Nasir-i Khusraw]]. According to the account, this early Islamic food distribution center — which predates the Ottoman ''[[imaret]]s'' — gave all visitors to Hebron a loaf of bread, a bowl of [[lentil]]s in [[olive oil]], and some [[raisins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-136-49894-7| last = Woodhead| first = Christine| title = The Ottoman World| page=73 |date = 2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hector 2.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;The Three Hectors&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hector Macpherson III was born in 1923 and died in Edinburgh in 1981&lt;ref&gt;This photograph appears in the book, ''Hector Macpherson: The Man and his Work'', between pages 16 and 17.&lt;center&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Hector Carsewell Macpherson''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]}} (16 October 1851 &amp;ndash; 17 October 1924) was a prolific Scottish writer and journalist who published books, pamphlets and articles on history, biography, politics, religion, and other subjects.

==Biography==
===Early years===

He was born in [[Glasgow]] on 16 October 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Hector Macpherson Jun., ''Hector Macpherson: The Man and his Work'', Edinburgh: W. F. Henderson, 19 George IV Bridge, 1925, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, he lived with his grandparents in [[Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire|Alexandria]], [[West Dunbartonshire]], and when he left school at fourteen he joined his father in Glasgow. He did not settle there and when he returned to his grandparent's home, he found work in the office of [http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/search_item/index.php?service=RCAHMS&amp;id=128245 Dalmonach Print Works]  in [[Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire|Alexandria]]. Between the ages of 18 and 21, he embarked on a rigorous course of self-education using the library of the [[Vale of Leven]] [[Mechanics' Institute]] in [[Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire|Alexandria]]. He began with the study of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and passed on to [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]], [[Matthew Arnold|Arnold]] and other intellectual giants.&lt;ref&gt;''Hector Macpherson: The Man and his Work'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; At this Institute, he received a prize for best essay, which was entitled "The Natural Business Relations Between Employer an Employed." 

In 1876, he had a series of articles published in the local newspaper, the ''Dumbarton Herald'', which were anonymous character sketches of local clergy. When his identity was revealed to the manager of the printing works, he was eventually forced to leave his job. However, in 1877 he had a successful interview with the ''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]'' and moved to Edinburgh thereafter. In 1880, he married Mary Janet Copland. His son and grandson were also named Hector Macpherson, thus causing much confusion. His son, [[Hector Macpherson (astronomer)|Hector Copland Macpherson]] (1888–1956), a [[Church of Scotland]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], had books published on [[astronomy]] and the [[Covenanters]] and these are often mistaken for his father's.&lt;ref&gt;The title page of Hector Macpherson's biography of his father states that he is author of "The Covenanters under Persecution"; "The Romance of Modern Astronomy" etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journalism career ===
* 1877-94 - Journalist with the ''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]''&lt;ref name="Waterston2"&gt;{{cite book

* 1894-1908 - Editor of the above newspaper&lt;ref name="Waterston2" /&gt;
* 1908-24 - Freelance journalist contributing extensively to ''[[Reynold's News]]paper'' among other newspapers.
* 1913-17 - Editor of the ''Scottish Nation'', monthly organ of the [[International Scots Home Rule League]] of which he was President for four or five years.&lt;ref&gt;''Hector Macpherson: The Man and his Work'', p. 43. Macpherson's career in journalism is clearly laid out in his son's biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literary achievements ===
Macpherson's first literary publication was a pamphlet entitled ''The Right Hon. [[W. E. Gladstone]]: His Political Career'', which was published in June 1892 by Andrew Eliot. Gladstone wrote him a letter of appreciation as a result.&lt;ref&gt;''Hector Macpherson: The Man and his Work'', p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; Macpherson also corresponded with [[Herbert Spencer]] who expressed surprise that he was able to write a book on [[Thomas Carlyle]] while being sympathetic with Spencer's views. Spencer regarded Carlyle's work as being "utterly antagonistic" to his own and he said that "on one occasion he [Carlyle] called me 'an immeasurable ass'." 

Macpherson's son suggests that his father's "own creed was a blend of what may be called the Carlylean and the Spencerian thought, combining the moral fire of the one with the scientific orderliness and logical precision of the other."&lt;ref&gt;''Hector Macpherson: The Man and his Work'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He gives us no further details concerning how this remarkable combination was achieved. However, Macpherson in his own ''[[Thomas Carlyle]]'' book attempts to reconcile the disparate views of Carlyle and Spencer. For instance, he suggests that Carlyle's 'might is right' view may be equated with Spencer's 'survival of the fittest' view.&lt;ref&gt;Hector C. Macpherson, ''[[Thomas Carlyle]],'' Edinburgh: [[Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier]], 1896, ([[List of books for the "Famous Scots Series"|"Famous Scots Series"]]), Ch. III, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works include:

*''A Century of Political Development'' (1908)
*''The Church, the Bible and War'' (1928)
*''[[Herbert Spencer]]: The Man and his Work''
*''The Cameronian Philosopher, [[Alexander Shields]]''

=== Political interests ===
Macpherson's politics were overwhelmingly Liberal and he gave unstinting support to successive Liberal governments. He argued vehemently against the [[jingoism]] of [[Rudyard Kipling]], regarding him as "a foe to civilisation" who "pandered to the innate brutality of the Anglo-Saxon race".&lt;ref&gt;''Hector Macpherson: The Man and his Work'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, he was involved in negotiations in the Netherlands with [[Boer]] leaders concerning the [[South African War]]. [[Paul Kruger]] told him that he didn't blame the [[Queen Victoria|Queen]] for the war: it was all [[Cecil Rhodes|Rhodes']] fault.&lt;ref&gt;''Hector Macpherson: The Man and his Work'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1908, he published a remarkable 42-page pamphlet entitled ''The Gospel of [[Socialism]]'' arguing in depth against socialism and communism. [[Winston Churchill]] wrote a foreword to that pamphlet in which he argues that liberalism rather than socialism is the answer. Churchill finishes by saying: "They wish to reconstruct the world. They begin by leaving out human nature."&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of [[Socialism]],'' with Foreword by the Right Hon. [[Winston Churchill]], M.P., Dundee and London: John Leng &amp; Co., Ltd, 1908, Foreword.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious interests ===
[[File:The simple marker on the grave of Hector MacPherson, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|300px|The simple marker on the grave of Hector MacPherson, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh]]
Macpherson's son informs us that his father was a "convinced Theist. He sat loose to dogma, and stood for freedom of thought in matters theological." ... "In private life my father was a devout believer in spiritual realities. Very firm was his belief in the overruling care of a Heavenly Father and in the immortality of the soul. But to him religion and life were one indivisible whole. His religion may be summed up in a real endeavour 'to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly' with his God."&lt;ref&gt;''Hector Macpherson: The Man and his Work'', pp. 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Macpherson certainly had a great interest in the history and development of religion in Scotland as evidenced by his books below.

===Death and legacy===
Macpherson was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in March 1924, shortly before he died. His proposers were [[Thomas Burns (Scottish minister)|Rev Thomas Burns]], Sir [[David Paulin]], [[James Young Simpson (scientist)|James Young Simpson]], [[Alexander Gault]] and his son, [[Hector Copland Macpherson]] (who had been elected in 1917).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hector C. Macpherson died on 17 October 1924 and was buried in [[Grange, Edinburgh|Grange Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]].

A simple marker on his grave lies in the south-west extension to the main cemetery. His wife, Mary Janet Copland (d.1925) lies with him. They were parents to [[Hector Copland Macpherson]] [[FRSE]] (1888-1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isacque (Isaac) Graeber''' (August 29, 1905 – 1984) was a [[sociologist]], Jewish historian, and author. He authored several books and numerous papers ranging in subject matters from Jewish-Gentile relations to Jewish Education. He studied at [[Columbia University]] and [[University of Pennsylvania]]. During his long career he served as director of the College of Jewish Studies in [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], and Director of Education to the Jewish community of [[Akron, Ohio]].

==Biography==

===Early years===

Isacque Graeber was born August 29, 1905 in [[Warsaw]], [[Congress Poland]], [[Russian Empire]] of ethnic [[Jewish]] parents. He earned a PhD, however the title or topic of his dissertation is unknown. He emigrated in 1921 and by the late 20s he began contributing articles to various journals, and by 1935 was working on his book titled, "Jews in a Gentile World."

As a staunch opponent of [[fascism]], Graeber was active in the [[Communist Party USA]]-sponsored [[League of American Writers]] and attended the organization's second congress in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Folsom, ''Days of Anger, Days of Hope: A Memoir of the League of American Writers, 1937-1942.'' Niwot, CO: University Press of Colorado, 1994; pg. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Graeber was temporarily employed by [[Max Horkheimer]]'s Institute of Social Research (through [[Franz L. Neumann]]) as an agent to solicit funding on commission from wealthy Jews for the Institute's project on anti-Semitism, which eventually became the "Studies in Prejudice" series sponsored by the [[American Jewish Committee]].

Graeber was a Fellow of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] served as professor of Jewish studies at [[Columbia University]] and was a professor of sociology at [[Yeshiva University]]. He was also on the staff of the Jewish Education Committee of New York.

===Writings===

Graeber contributed to journals like ''Judaism'', ''Jewish Life'', ''The Jewish Forum'' and ''Jewish Education''. As well as to non-Jewish journals like ''[[Social Research]]'' and ''Panorama.''

In 1942 he edited and published the seminal''Jews in a Gentile World,'' a collection of essays by eighteen widely published experts in sociology, anthropology, psychology, political science, economics, history, and philosophy who contributed objective examinations of the problems of anti-Semitism. The authors utilized social science findings to analyze practical issues that face both Jew and non-Jew. The book also included his own essay.

Contributors included [[Carleton S. Coon]] Professor of [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Talcott Parsons]] [[Harvard University]] [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] [[Harvard University]] and [[Everett V. Stonequist]], [[Skidmore College]].

He wrote on many topics, however most of his focus was on Jewish topics. Titles of his articles include "The Financial Role of Jews in America,"&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''The Future,''  June 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; "An Examination of Theories of Race Prejudice,"&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''Social Research.''&lt;/ref&gt; and "The [[Alliance Israelite Universelle]]: A Historical Evaluation."&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''Jewish Life,'' October 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 he published a pamphlet titled "The Truth About Anti-Semitism" which was a call for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

He also authored a textbook titled "The History of Zionism" which was prepared for the use by "Zionist study circles". It was published by the Zionist Organization of America.

===Death and legacy===

Isacque Graeber died in 1984.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8580">The '''Juntas Generales''' ('''Batzar Nagusiak''' in [[Basque language|Basque]]) are [[representative assembly|representative assemblies]] in the [[Southern Basque Country]] that go back to the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main Juntas Generals in the Basque Country were - and are - the ''Juntas Generales of [[Biscay]]'', the ''Juntas Generales of [[Gipuzkoa]]'' and the ''Juntas Generales of [[Álava]]''. The equivalent in Navarre was the Cortes&amp;mdash;or ''The Three States'', roughly House of the Commons&amp;mdash;to become the present-day [[Parliament of Navarre]].

They were part of an early form of democratic institutions. At the local level, the heads of households (male or female) would meet on Sundays after church at the church door in a meeting called [[elizate]] (or ''anteiglesia'' in Spanish) to debate and decide on local issues. An elizate in turn would elect someone to represent the local community at the ''juntas'', which existed from the district level right up to the provincial Juntas Generales.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

==Historical development==
Little is known about the historical background of these local and regional institutions prior to the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; Broadly speaking, two historical periods can be distinguished:
#The period from the 14th century to 1876 when the Juntas Generales were abolished
#The period from 1979 to the present when the Juntas Generales were reinstated.

After the [[First Carlist War]], the fueros were much weakened and [[End of Basque home rule in Spain|eventually fully abolished]] after the [[Second Carlist War]] in 1876.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; Although the Spanish Government of the time established the ''[[Basque Economic Agreement|conciertos económicos]]'' involving low taxes, protective tariffs and self-collection of taxes, Madrid demolished Basque institutions including the Juntas Generales.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;{{rp|23}}

Following the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] in the 1970s the [[Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country]] re-instated the Juntas Generales in Biscay, Gipuzkoa and Álava in 1979.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

==Navarre==
Unlike the other Basque provinces, Navarre had evolved into the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] and had developed to a large extent [[feudalism|feudal]] traditions and institutions in line with other European kingdoms of the time. As a result, it was largely excluded from the development of such early democratic institutions.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; However, the royal authority was but one layer of the governmental institutions, and the latter&amp;mdash;''diputacion'' or government council, "[[Parliament of Navarre|The Three States" (Cortes)]]&amp;mdash;were based on the [[Fueros of Navarre|Navarrese charters]] stemming from [[Custom (law)|similar values, traditions]] and [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|institutions to the other Basque regions]]. 

It did have a charter however, the 1841 ''Ley Paccionada de Fueros'' which Navarre managed to protect when the fueros of Biscay, Gipuzkoa and Álava were abolished in 1879.&lt;ref name=Libro&gt;Torrealdi, JM ''El Libro Negro del Euskera'' Ttarttalo: 1998 {{ISBN|84-8091-395-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Juntas Generales'' ==
===The Juntas Generales of Gipuzkoa===
* [[General Assembly of Gipuzkoa]]
===The Juntas Generales of Biscay===
[[Image:Gernika batzar nagusiak1.jpg|thumb|The Casa de Juntas in [[Gernika-Lumo]].]]
Both historically and currently, the Juntas Generales of Biscay are based in [[Gernika-Lumo]], at the famous [[Casa de Juntas]]. Prior to the abolition of the [[Fuero|foral laws]] and the Juntas Generales of Biscay, the [[Basque señoríos]] met under the Oak of Gernika to swear they would respect the ancient laws of Biscay.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

Of all historical Juntas Generales, this is perhaps the most widely known and important one as it was in Gernika the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish monarchs]] were required to swear to uphold the Basque freedoms since the incorporation of Biscay and Gipuzkoa into the [[Kingdom of Castile]] from 1200 onwards.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

====The modern era====
The modern Juntas Generales of Biscay were re-instated in 1979 and form a [[Unicameralism|unicameral assembly]]. Its 51 (90 in 1979 only) members, the ''batzarkideak'' (in Basque) or ''apoderados'' (in Spanish), are elected by the people of Biscay every four years alongside the [[Local election|municipal elections]].

Their duties are to:
* form the Provincial Government of Biscay (the ''Diputación Foral de Vizcaya'' (Spanish)/''Bizkaiko Foru Aldundia'' (Basque)
* to elect a president
* to develop the [[Fuero|foral laws]] of Biscay
* to administer the province's budget

The party political composition since 1979 has been as follows:

The [[lehendakari]] of the Juntas Generales of Biscay has hailed from the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) since 1987:

===The Juntas Generales of Alava===
Is the Representative Assambly of Alava. It has 51 representatives. The Lehendakari is Ramiro Gonzalez from EAJ-PNV, with 13 representatives. The leader of the Opposition is Marta Alaña from PP. The next parties with deputies are EH Bildu, Podemos, PSE-EE, Irabazi and Ciudadanos.

Other Lehendakaris were Fernando Buesa (PSE-EE), Ramon Rabanera and Javier de Andres (PP) and Xabier Aguirre (EAJ-PNV).

==French Basque Country==
While they were overall less widely known due to the northern districts&amp;mdash;[[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]], [[Soule]]&amp;mdash;falling behind in terms of economic development,&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; they also had assemblies that were largely independent of those of the French state and held charters - the ''fors'', the northern equivalent of the ''fueros''.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; Their powers and sovereignty were gradually curtailed by the French Crown, [[History of the Basque people#Modern Period|notably in 1620 and 1659-1660]] following the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], but remained in place and relevant (e.g. the ''Biltzar'' of Labourd) about decisions affecting regional life until the [[Napoleonic period]] (1790).

Various groups, among them the [[Gutian people|Guti]], [[Hurrians]], Mannai ([[Mannaeans]]), and [[Armenians]], lived in this region in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kurdistanica.com/english/history/articles-his/his-articles-02.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501191513/http://kurdistanica.com/english/history/articles-his/his-articles-02.html |date=1 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Mannaean homeland was situated east and south of the [[Lake Urmia]], roughly centered around modern-day [[Mahabad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050086 |title=Mahabad|work= Britannica Online Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region came under [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule during the reign of [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Darius I]].

The Kingdom of [[Corduene]], which emerged from the declining [[Seleucid Empire]], was located to the south and south-east of [[Lake Van]] between Persia and Mesopotamia and ruled northern Mesopotamia and southeastern [[Anatolia]] from 189 BC to AD 384 as vassals of the vying [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and Roman Empire. Corduene became a [[vassal]] state of the [[Roman Republic]] in 66 BC and remained allied with the Romans until AD 384. After 66 BC, it passed another 5 times between [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and Persia&lt;!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, "Persian Empire"; link to a specific iteration of this topic --&gt;. Corduene was situated to the east of [[Tigranocerta]], that is, to the east and south of present-day [[Diyarbakır]] in south-eastern Turkey.

One of the earliest records of the phrase ''land of the Kurds'' is found in an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christian document of [[late antiquity]], describing the stories of Assyrian saints of the Middle East, such as [[Abdisho]]. When the [[Sasanian]] [[Marzban]] asked Mar Abdisho about his place of origin, he replied that according to his parents, they were originally from ''Hazza,'' a village in [[Assyria]]. However they were later driven out of Hazza by [[Assyrian paganism|pagans]], and settled in ''Tamanon,'' which according to Abdisho was in the ''land of the Kurds.'' Tamanon lies just north of the modern Iraq-Turkey border, while Hazza is 12&amp;nbsp;km southwest of modern [[Erbil]]. In another passage in the same document, the region of the [[Khabur (Tigris)|Khabur River]] is also identified as ''land of the Kurds''.&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Walker, ''The Legend of [[Mar Qardagh]]: Narrative and Christian Heroism in Late Antique Iraq'' (368 pages), University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-24578-4}}, 2006, pp. 26, 52, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Al-Muqaddasi]] and [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], Tamanon was located on the south-western or southern slopes of [[Mount Judi]] and south of [[Cizre]].&lt;ref&gt;T.

Sinclair, "Eastern Turkey, an Architectural and Archaeological Survey", Vol. 3, Pindar Press, {{ISBN|978-1-904597-76-6}}, 1989, page 337.&lt;/ref&gt; Other geographical references to the Kurds in [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]] sources appear in [[Zuqnin Chronicle|Zuqnin]] chronicle, writings of [[Michael the Syrian]] and [[Bar Hebraeus|Bar hebraeus]].

Kurdistan in the [[Middle Ages]] was a collection of semi-independent and independent states called [[emirate]]s. It was nominally under indirect political or religious influence of Khalifs or Shahs. A comprehensive history of these states and their relationship with their neighbors is given in the text of ''Sharafnama'', written by Prince [[Sharaf al-Din Bitlisi]] in 1597.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mazdapublishers.com/book/sharafnama |title=Sharafnama: History of the Kurdish Nation |publisher=Mazdapublishers.com |date= |accessdate=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a list of these entities see [http://www.kurdistanica.com/english/geography/maps/map-03.html Kurdistan and its native Provincial subdivisions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051118033137/http://www.kurdistanica.com/english/geography/maps/map-03.html |date=18 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The emirates included [[Baban]], [[Soran Emirate|Soran]], [[Badinan Emirate|Badinan]] and [[Garmiyan]] in the south; Bakran, Bohtan (or Botan) and [[Badlis]] in the north, and [[Mukriyan]] and [[Ardalan]] in the east.

The earliest medieval attestation of the [[toponym]] ''Kurdistan'' is found in a 12th-century [[Armenian language|Armenian]] historical text by [[Matthew of Edessa|Matteos Urhayeci]]. He described a battle near [[Diyarbakır|Amid]] and [[Siverek]] in 1062 as to have taken place in ''Kurdistan''.&lt;ref&gt;Matt'eos Urhayec'i, {{hy icon}}''Ժամանակագրություն'' (Chronicle), ed. by M.

(see p.19)&lt;/ref&gt; The second record occurs in the prayer from the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] of an Armenian manuscript of the [[Gospels]], written in 1200.&lt;ref&gt;A.S.

Asatrian, ''Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds'', Iran and the Caucasus, Vol.13, pp.1–58, 2009. (p.20)&lt;/ref&gt;

A later use of the term ''Kurdistan'' is found in [[Empire of Trebizond]] documents in 1336&lt;ref&gt;Zehiroglu, Ahmet M. ; "Trabzon Imparatorlugu" 2016 ({{ISBN|978-605-4567-52-2}}) ; p.169&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Nuzhat-al-Qulub'', written by [[Hamdollah Mostowfi]] in 1340.&lt;ref&gt;G.

According to Sharafkhan Bitlisi in his [[Sharafnama]], the boundaries of the Kurdish land begin at the [[Strait of Hormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] and stretch on an even line to the end of [[Malatya]] and [[Kahramanmaraş|Marash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Özoğlu |first=Hakan |date=2004 |title=Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State |publisher=State University of New York Press |pages=27–28 |isbn=0-7914-5993-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evliya Çelebi]], who traveled in Kurdistan between 1640 and 1655, mentioned different districts of Kurdistan including [[Erzurum]], [[Van, Turkey|Van]], [[Hakkari]], [[Cizre]], [[Amadiya|Imaddiya]], [[Mosul]], [[Shahrizor]], [[Harir]], [[Ardalan]], [[Baghdad]], Derne, Derteng, until [[Basra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Özoğlu |first=Hakan |date=2004 |title=Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State |publisher=State University of New York Press |page=34 |isbn=0-7914-5993-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, after prolonged wars, Kurdish-inhabited areas were split between the [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires. A major division of Kurdistan occurred in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514, and was formalized in the 1639 [[Treaty of Zuhab]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Dahlman, "The Political Geography of Kurdistan", ''Eurasian Geography and Economics'', Vol.43, No.4, pp.271–299, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; From then until the aftermath of World War I, Kurdish areas (including most of [[Mesopotamia]], eastern [[Anatolia]], and traditionally Kurdish northeastern [[Syria]]) were generally under Ottoman rule, apart from the century-long, intermittent Iranian occupation in the early modern to modern period, and the later reconquest and vast expansion by the Iranian military leader [[Nader Shah]] in the first half of the 18th century. After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] contrived to split Kurdistan (as detailed in the ultimately unratified [[Treaty of Sèvres]]) among several countries, including Kurdistan, [[Armenia]] and others. However, the reconquest of these areas by the forces of [[Kemal Atatürk]] (and other pressing issues) caused the Allies to accept the renegotiated [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] and the borders of the modern Republic of Turkey, leaving the Kurds without a self-ruled region. Other Kurdish areas were assigned to the new British and French [[League of Nations mandate|mandated]] states of [[British Mandate of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]].

[[File:WholeRegionSevres.gif|thumb|300px|Left|Kurdistan (shaded area) as suggested by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]]]

At the [[San Francisco Peace Conference]] of 1945, the Kurdish delegation proposed consideration of territory claimed by the Kurds, which encompassed an area extending from the Mediterranean shores near [[Adana]] to the shores of the [[Persian Gulf]] near [[Bushehr]], and included the [[Lurs|Lur]] inhabited areas of southern [[Zagros]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Dahlman, ''The Political Geography of Kurdistan'', Eurasian Geography and Economics, Vol.43, No.4, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akakurdistan.com/kurds/map/map.html |title=The map presented by the Kurdish League Delegation, March 1945 |publisher=Akakurdistan.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[First Gulf War]], the Allies established a safe haven in northern Iraq. Amid the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from three northern provinces, [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] emerged in 1992 as an autonomous entity inside Iraq with its own local government and parliament.

A 2010 US report, written before the instability in Syria and Iraq that exists as of 2014, attested that "Kurdistan may exist by 2030".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2012/12/turkey4356.htm|title=Turkey may be divided, a Kurdish state could become a reality by 2030: U.S. Intelligence report|work=ekurd.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weakening of the Iraqi state following the [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|2014 Northern Iraq offensive]] by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] has also presented an opportunity for independence for Iraqi Kurdistan,&lt;ref name="opportunity" /&gt; augmented by Turkey's move towards acceptance of such a state although it opposes moves toward Kurdish autonomy in Turkey and Syria.&lt;ref name="turkey_ok" /&gt;

==== Northern Kurdistan ====
{{Main|Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|Iraqi–Kurdish conflict|Kurdish separatism in Iran}}
The incorporation into Turkey of the Kurdish-inhabited regions of eastern Anatolia was opposed by many Kurds, and has resulted in a long-running separatist conflict in which thousands of lives have been lost. The region saw several major Kurdish rebellions, including the [[Koçgiri rebellion]] of 1920 under the Ottomans, then successive insurrections under the Turkish state, including the 1924 [[Sheikh Said rebellion]], the [[Republic of Ararat]] in 1927, and the 1937 [[Dersim rebellion]]. All were forcefully put down by the authorities. The region was declared a closed military area from which foreigners were banned between 1925 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;M.M.

In an attempt to deny their existence, the Turkish government categorized Kurds as "Mountain Turks" until 1991;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/turkey/26.htm|title=Turkey - Linguistic and Ethnic Groups|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartkus, Viva Ona, ''The Dynamic of Secession'', (Cambridge University Press, 1999), 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Çelik|first=Yasemin|title=Contemporary Turkish foreign policy|year=1999|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-275-96590-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9PXcwFOLNcC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=mountain%20turks&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=mountain%20turks&amp;f=false|edition=1. publ.|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words "Kurds", "Kurdistan", or "Kurdish" were officially banned by the Turkish government.&lt;ref name=bahar /&gt; Following the [[military coup of 1980]], the Kurdish language was officially prohibited in public and private life.&lt;ref name=NYTK&gt;Toumani, Meline.

In 1983, the Kurdish provinces were placed under [[martial law]] in response to the activities of the militant separatist organization the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK).&lt;ref name="hue"&gt;Kurd, ''The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia including Atlas'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/28/world/africa/28iht-28iraq.7671792.html], NY Times, 28 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A [[guerrilla war]] took place through the 1980s and 1990s in which much of the countryside was evacuated, thousands of Kurdish-populated villages were destroyed by the government, and numerous [[summary execution]]s were carried out by both sides.&lt;ref name="ocpw"&gt;Martin van Bruinessen, "Kurdistan."

Turkey has historically feared that a Kurdish state in Northern Iraq would encourage and support Kurdish separatists in the adjacent Turkish provinces, and have therefore historically strongly opposed Kurdish independence in Iraq. However, following the chaos in Iraq after [[2003 invasion of Iraq|the US invasion]], Turkey has increasingly worked with the autonomous [[Kurdistan Regional Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-06-18/half-price-kurdish-oil-threatens-iraq-breakup-with-turkish-help|title=Bloomberg Business|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The successful [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|2014 Northern Iraq offensive]] by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], with the resultant weakening of the ability of the Iraqi state to project power, also presented a "golden opportunity" for the Kurds to increase their independence and possibly declare an independent Kurdish state.&lt;ref name="opportunity"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecairoreview.com/tahrir-forum/the-rise-of-isis-a-golden-opportunity-for-iraqs-kurds/|title=The Rise of ISIS, a Golden Opportunity for Iraq’s Kurds|work=aucegypt.edu|date=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, who took more than 80 Turkish persons captive in Mosul during their offensive, is an enemy of Turkey, making Kurdistan useful for Turkey as a buffer state.

== Geography ==
[[File:Ancient Kurdistan.png|thumb|225px|Historic map from 1721 showing borders of Curdistan provinces in [[Persia]]]]

According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Kurdistan covers about 190,000&amp;nbsp;km², and its chief towns are [[Diyarbakır]] (Amed), [[Bitlis]] (Bedlîs) and [[Van, Turkey|Van]] (Wan) in Turkey, [[Erbil]] (Hewlêr) and [[Slemani]] in Iraq, and [[Kermanshah]] (Kirmanşan), [[Sanandaj]] (Sine), [[Ilam, Iran|Ilam]] and [[Mahabad]] (Mehabad) in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/325241/Kurdistan Kurdistan], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], Kurdistan covers around 190,000&amp;nbsp;km² in Turkey, 125,000&amp;nbsp;km² in Iran, 65,000&amp;nbsp;km² in Iraq, and 12,000&amp;nbsp;km² in Syria, with a total area of approximately 392,000&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name="EncIslam"&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]{{Page needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iraqi Kurdistan]] is divided into six [[governorate]]s, three of which (and parts of others) are under the control of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]]. [[Iranian Kurdistan]] encompasses [[Kurdistan Province]] and the greater parts of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]], [[Kermanshah Province|Kermanshah]], and [[Īlām Province|Īlām]] provinces. [[Rojava|Syrian Kurdistan]] ([[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]]: Rojavayê Kurdistanê) is located primarily in northern Syria, and covers the province of [[Al-Hasakah Governorate|Al Hasakah]] and northern [[Raqqa Governorate]], northern [[Aleppo Governorate]] and also [[Jabal al-Akrad]] (Mountain of the Kurds) region. The major cities in this region are [[Qamishli]] (Kurdish: Qamişlo) and Al Hasakah (Kurdish: Hasakah).

[[Turkish Kurdistan]] encompasses a large area of [[Eastern Anatolia Region]] and [[Southeastern Anatolia Region|southeastern Anatolia]] of Turkey and it is home to an estimated 6 to 8 million Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Myrie |first=Clive |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7062971.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Kurds show coded support for PKK |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-10-26 |accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are another 9 to 12 million Turkish citizens of Kurdish descent in predominantly Turkish regions of Turkey as the majority of Turkish Kurds no longer live in Southeastern Anatolia.

=== Subdivisions (Upper and Lower Kurdistan) ===
In ''A Dictionary of Scripture Geography'' (published 1846), John Miles describes Upper and Lower Kurdistan as following:
[[File:Kurdish States 1902 -outlined.jpg|thumb|The States outlined in red are two Kurdish States named Hakkiari and Mosul in this 1902 map. They are referred to as Upper Kurdistan and Lower Kurdistan respectively.]]
{{quote|Modern Curdistan is of much greater extent than the ancient Assyria, and is composed of two parts the Upper and Lower. In the former is the province of Ardelan, the ancient Arropachatis, now nominally a part of Irak Ajami, and belonging to the north west division called Al Jobal. It contains five others namely, Betlis, the ancient Carduchia, lying to the south and south west of the lake Van. East and south east of Betlis is the principality of Julamerick, south west of it is the principality of Amadia. the fourth is Jeezera ul Omar, a city on an island in the Tigris, and corresponding to the ancient Bezabde. the fifth and largest is Kara Djiolan, with a capital of the same name. The pashalics of Kirkook and Solimania also comprise part of Upper Curdistan. Lower Curdistan comprises all the level tract to the east of the Tigris, and the minor ranges immediately bounding the plains and reaching thence to the foot of the great range, which may justly be denominated the Alps of western Asia.&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Scripture Geography, p 57, by John Miles, 486 pages, Published 1846, Original from Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The northern, northwestern and northeastern parts of Kurdistan are referred to as upper Kurdistan, and includes the areas from west of Amed to lake Urmia.

The lowlands of southern Kurdistan are called lower Kurdistan. The main cities in this area are Kirkuk and Arbil.

=== Climate ===
Much of the region is typified by a [[continental climate]] – hot in the summer, cold in the winter. Despite this, much of the region is fertile and has historically exported [[grain]] and [[livestock]]. Precipitation varies between 200 and 400&amp;nbsp;mm a year in the plains, and between 700 and 3,000&amp;nbsp;mm a year on the high plateau between mountain chains.&lt;ref name="EncIslam" /&gt; The climate is dominated by mountains in the zone along the border with Iran and Turkey, with [[Mediterranean climate|dry summers]], rainy and sometimes snowy winters, and damp springs, while to the south it progressively transitions towards [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] and [[desert climate|desert]] zones. The northern mountainous regions along the border with Iran and Turkey receive heavy [[snow]]fall and they are more of an extreme version of the continental climate.

=== Flora and fauna===
Kurdistan is one of the most mountainous regions in the world with a [[continental climate|cold climate]] receiving annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] adequate to sustain temperate forests and [[shrubs]]. Mountain chains harbor pastures and forested valleys, totaling approximately 16 million hectares (160,000&amp;nbsp;km²), including [[fir]]s and countryside is mostly [[oak]]s, [[Conifer cone|conifers]], [[platanus]], [[willow]], [[Populus|poplar]] and, to the west of Kurdistan, [[olive trees]].&lt;ref name="EncIslam" /&gt; The region north of the mountainous region on the border with Iran and Turkey features meadow grasses and such wild trees as [[Populus|poplar]], willow and oak, [[Crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]], [[cherry plum]], [[rose hip]]s, mountain apple, [[Pyrus elaeagrifolia|pear]], [[Sorbus|mountain ash]], and olive. The [[steppe]] and desert in the south, by contrast, have such species as [[Arecaceae|palm trees]] and [[date palm]].

=== Mountains ===
Mountains are important geographical and symbolic features of Kurdish life, as evidenced by the saying "Kurds have no friends but the mountains."&lt;ref&gt;John Bulloch and Harvey Morris, ''No Friends but the Mountains: The Tragic History of the Kurds'', {{ISBN|0-19-508075-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mountains are regarded as [[Sacred mountains|sacred]] by the [[Kurds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-l-phillips/iraqi-kurds-no-friend-but_b_4045389.html|title=Iraqi Kurds: "No Friend but the Mountains"|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the region are [[Mount Judi]] and [[Mount Ararat|Ararat]] (both prominent in Kurdish folklore), [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros]], [[Qandil Mountains|Qandil]], [[Sinjar Mountains|Shingal]], [[Mount Abdulaziz]], [[Kurd Mountains]], [[Jabal al-Akrad]], Shaho, Gabar, [[Hamrin Mountains|Hamrin]], and [[Mount Nisir|Nisir]].

=== Rivers ===
The plateaus and mountains of Kurdistan, which are characterized by heavy rain and snow fall, act as a water reservoir for the Near and Middle East, forming the source of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers, as well as other numerous smaller rivers, such as the [[Little Khabur]], [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]], Tharthar, Ceyhan, [[Araxes]], Kura, Sefidrud, Karkha, and Hezil. Among rivers of historical importance to Kurds are the [[Murat River|Murat]] (Arasān) and Buhtān rivers in Turkey; the Peshkhābur, the [[Little Zab]], the [[Great Zab]], and the [[Diyala River|Diyala]] in Iraq; and the Jaghatu (Zarrinarud), the Tātā'u (Siminarud), the Zohāb (Zahāb), and the Gāmāsiyāb in Iran.

These rivers, which flow from heights of three to four thousand meters above sea level, are significant both as water sources and for the production of energy. Iraq and Syria dammed many of these rivers and their tributaries, and Turkey has an extensive dam system under construction as part of the [[Southeastern Anatolia Project|GAP (Southeast Anatolia Project)]]; though incomplete, the GAP already supplies a significant proportion of Turkey's electrical energy needs. Due to the extraordinary archaeological richness of the region, almost any dam impacts historic sites.&lt;ref name="Kurdistanica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurdistanica.com/?q=node/113 |title=Economy: Water |publisher=The Encyclopædia of Kurdistan |accessdate=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lakes ===
Kurdistan extends to [[Lake Urmia]] in Iran on the east. The region includes Lake Van, the largest body of water in Turkey; the only lake in the Middle East with a larger surface is Lake Urmia – though not nearly as deep as Lake Van, which has a much larger volume. [[Lake Urmia|Urmia]], [[Lake Van|Van]], as well as [[Zarivar Lake]] west of [[Marivan]], and [[Lake Dukan]] near the city of [[Sulaymaniyah]], are frequented by tourists.&lt;ref name="Kurdistanica" /&gt;

=== Petroleum and mineral resources ===
[[Kurdistan Regional Government|KRG]]-controlled parts of Iraqi Kurdistan are estimated to contain around {{convert|45|Goilbbl}} of oil, making it the sixth largest reserve in the world. Extraction of these reserves began in 2007.

[[Al-Hasakah Governorate|Al-Hasakah]] province, also known as [[Upper Mesopotamia|Jazira]] region, has geopolitical importance of [[Petroleum|oil]] and is suitable for agricultural lands.

In November 2011, Exxon challenged the Iraqi central government's authority with the signing of oil and gas contracts for exploration rights to six parcels of land in Kurdistan, including one contract in the disputed territories, just east of the Kirkuk mega-field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernzagros.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/121126_operator_activity_EXTERNAL.pdf westernzagros.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109173803/http://www.westernzagros.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/121126_operator_activity_EXTERNAL.pdf |date= 9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This act caused Baghdad to threaten to revoke Exxon's contract in its southern fields, most notably the West-Qurna Phase 1 project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exxon's Kurdistan|url=http://www.zawya.com/story/ZAWYA20120304053739/|accessdate=2012-12-31|newspaper=Zawya|date=2012-03-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417231147/http://www.zawya.com/story/ZAWYA20120304053739/|archivedate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exxon responded by announcing its intention to leave the West-Qurna project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq says expects Exxon to finish West Qurna Sale by December|url=https://news.yahoo.com/iraq-says-expects-exxon-finish-west-qurna-sale-104523440--finance.html|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2007, the Kurdish government solicited foreign companies to invest in 40 new oil sites, with the hope of increasing regional oil production over the following five years by a factor of five, to about {{convert|1|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqupdates.com/p_articles.php/article/19228 |title=Iraqi Kurds open 40 new oil sites to foreign investors |publisher=Iraq Updates |date=2007-07-09 |accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gas and associated gas reserves are in excess of {{convert|100|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Notable companies active in Kurdistan include [[ExxonMobil]], [[Total S.A.|Total]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[Talisman Energy]], [[Genel Energy]], [[Hunt Oil]], [[Gulf Keystone Petroleum]], and [[Marathon Oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kurdistan Oil and Gas Activity Map |url=http://www.westernzagros.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/121126_operator_activity_EXTERNAL.pdf |publisher=Western Zagros |accessdate=2012-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109173803/http://www.westernzagros.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/121126_operator_activity_EXTERNAL.pdf |archivedate= 9 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mineral resources that exist in significant quantities in the region include [[coal]], [[copper]], [[gold]], [[iron]], [[limestone]] (which is used to produce [[cement]]), [[marble]], and [[zinc]]. The world's largest deposit of rock sulfur is located just southwest of [[Erbil]] (Hewlêr).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurdistancorporation.com/Oil_and_gas.htm Official statements on the oil and gas sector in the Kurdistan region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012180933/http://kurdistancorporation.com/Oil_and_gas.htm |date=12 October 2007 }}, Kurdistan Development Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government signed an agreement by which Turkey will supply the KRG with refined petroleum products in exchange for crude oil. Crude deliveries are expected to occur on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Shipment of Kurdistan Crude Arrives in Turkey|url=http://www.brightwire.com/news/229205-first-shipment-of-kurdistan-crude-arrives-in-turkey|publisher=BrightWire|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130118132757/http://www.brightwire.com/news/229205-first-shipment-of-kurdistan-crude-arrives-in-turkey|archivedate=18 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}
'''Lawfare''' is a form of war consisting of the use of the legal system against an enemy, such as by damaging or delegitimizing them, tying up their time or winning a [[public relations]] victory.&lt;ref name="Case Western Journal of International Law"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.case.edu/orgs/jil/vol.43.1.2/43_Lawfare_Report.pdf |title=Is Lawfare Worth Defining? |journal=Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law |volume=43 |issue=1 |date=11 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807201635/http://www.case.edu/orgs/jil/vol.43.1.2/43_Lawfare_Report.pdf |archivedate=7 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="terrorism.com"&gt;''Unrestricted Warfare'', [http://www.terrorism.com/documents/TRC-Analysis/unrestricted.pdf p. 55] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119123552/http://www.terrorism.com/documents/TRC-Analysis/unrestricted.pdf |date=19 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''law'' and ''warfare''.

==Origin of the term==
Perhaps the first use of the term "lawfare" was in the 1975 manuscript ''Whither Goeth the Law'', which argues that the Western legal system has become overly contentious and utilitarian as compared to the more humanitarian, norm-based Eastern system.{{clarify|reason=What is the "Eastern" system of law? This concept seems to be entirely novel, and it leaves a lot to the imagination. Is it something found in Australia, China, the Ottoman empire...?|date=July 2015}}&lt;ref name=whither&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.laceweb.org.au/whi.htm |title=Whither Goeth the Law – Humanity or Barbarity, The Way Out – Radical Alternatives in Australia |editor=M. Smith |editor2=D. Crossley |year=1975 |location=Melbourne |publisher=Lansdowne Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more frequently cited use of the term was [[Charles J. Dunlap, Jr.]]'s 2001 essay authored for Harvard's Carr Center.&lt;ref name=whither/&gt; In that essay, Dunlap defines lawfare as "the use of law as a weapon of war".&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, Law and Military Interventions: Preserving Humanitarian Values in 21st Century Conflicts (29 November 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; He later expanded on the definition, explaining lawfare was "the exploitation of real, perceived, or even orchestrated incidents of law-of-war violations being employed as an unconventional means of confronting" a superior military power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Charles J. Dunlap, Jr.]] |title=Lawfare amid warfare |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=3 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawfare and universal jurisdiction==
Lawfare may involve the law of a nation turned against its own officials, but more recently it has been associated with the spread of [[universal jurisdiction]], that is, one nation or an international organization hosted by that nation reaching out to seize and prosecute officials of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Goldsmith |authorlink=Jack Goldsmith |title=The Terror Presidency: Law and Judgement Inside the Bush Administration |publisher=W. W. Norton |location=New York City, New York |year=2007 |pages=53–64 |isbn=978-0-393-06550-3}}(discussing lawfare and the spread of universal jurisdiction).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Whether lawfare is a positive or negative term==

===Positive===
Colonel Charles Dunlap describes lawfare as "a method of warfare where law is used as a means of realizing a military objective".&lt;ref name=Dunlap-p4&gt;{{cite journal |author=Colonel Charles J. Dunlap, Jr. |date=29 November 2001 |title=Law and Military Interventions: Preserving Humanitarian Values in 21st Conflicts |page=4 |url=http://people.duke.edu/~pfeaver/dunlap.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense lawfare may be a more humane substitute for military conflict. Colonel Dunlap considers lawfare overall a "cynical manipulation of the rule of law and the humanitarian values it represents".&lt;ref name=Dunlap-p4/&gt;

[[Benjamin Wittes]], Robert Chesney, and Jack Goldsmith employed the word in the name of the Lawfare Blog, which focuses on national security law and which has explored the term and the debate over what lawfare means and whether it should be considered exclusively a pejorative.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has argued that lawfare should not have only a negative connotation, but that it also refers to the sharply contested legal debates in the U.S. surrounding national security, and national security law. Wittes writes, "The name Lawfare refers both to the use of law as a weapon of conflict and, perhaps more importantly, to the depressing reality that America remains at war with itself over the law governing its warfare with others."&lt;ref name="harvardnsj1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Benjamin Wittes]] |author2=Stephanie Leutert |url=http://harvardnsj.org/2013/05/on-wikipedia-lawfare-blogs-and-sources/ |title=On Wikipedia, Lawfare, Blogs, and Sources |publisher=Harvard Law School |journal=National Security Journal |date=12 May 2013 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative===
The [[Lawfare Project]] argues lawfare is exclusively negative, defining it as "the ''abuse'' of Western laws and judicial systems to achieve strategic military or political ends".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The Lawfare Project: What is Lawfare? {{cite web |url=http://www.thelawfareproject.org/what-is-lawfare.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419184924/http://www.thelawfareproject.org/what-is-lawfare.html |archivedate=19 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, lawfare consists of "the negative manipulation of international and national human rights laws to accomplish purposes other than, or contrary to, those for which they were originally enacted".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a 2010 speech on the topic, Lawfare Project Director [[Brooke Goldstein]] elaborated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... lawfare is about more than just delegitimizing a state's right to defend itself; it is about the abuse of the law and our judicial systems to undermine the very principles they stands for: the rule of law, the sanctity of innocent human life, and the right to free speech. Lawfare is not something in which persons engage in the pursuit of justice; it is a negative undertaking and must be defined as such to have any real meaning. Otherwise, we risk diluting the phenomenon and feeding the inability to distinguish between what is the correct application of the law, on the one hand, and what is lawfare, on the other. Because that is the essence of the issue here, how do we distinguish between that which constitutes a constructive, legitimate legal battle (even if the legal battle is against us and inconvenient) from that which is a counterproductive perversion of the law, which should be allocated no precedent? The delineation is not as simple as some may like to make it; that is, that lawsuits against terrorists are good, and legal actions against the U.S. and Israel are bad. Now, the question is not "who is the target", but "what is the intention" behind the legal action: is it to pursue justice, to apply the law in the interests of freedom and democracy, or is the intent to undermine the system of laws being manipulated?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brooke Goldstein |date=5 November 2010 |title=Lawfare: Real Threat or Illusion |url=http://www.thelawfareproject.org/Articles-by-LP-Staff/lawfare-real-threat-or-illusion.html#_ftn2 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Examples==

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
The NGO Forum of the 2001 [[Durban Conference]] called for the "establishment of a [[war crimes]] tribunal" against [[Israel]]. NGOs have used universal [[jurisdiction]] [[statutes]] in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] to bring forward such cases. These statutes allow courts to preside over cases in which one or more of the parties (or events at issue) are foreign. In some countries, such as [[Spain]], an NGO can apply to a court directly for an [[arrest warrant]] or to launch a [[criminal investigation]] without the knowledge or approval of the [[government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/ngo_lawfare |title=NGO Lawfare |publisher=NGO Monitor |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cases have been brought forward against Israeli officials and those associated with Israel's military, accusing them of war crimes. These cases have been heard in both Israel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/ngo_lawfare#overview |title=NGO Monitor Monograph&amp;nbsp;– Overview of lawfare cases involving Israel |publisher=NGO Monitor |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gmynj_k6iUwMVCNzjvqmD6MoZhZQ?docId=CNG.c4e5aaec1a6b9ae498dbebf05c7cebdc.13d1 |title=Netanyahu aide skips UK trip fearing arrest |publisher=AFP |date=2011-05-04 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US Ambassador [[John R. Bolton]] has characterized Palestinian attempts to seek UN recognition for a state as "lawfare", because he sees those attempts as delegitimizing Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bolton |first=John R. |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/3/israels-increasing-vulnerability/ |title=BOLTON: Israel's increasing vulnerability |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters of Israel, such as [[Shurat HaDin]] (Israeli Law Centre), have been accused of using "lawfare" to get authorities to seize activist ships bound for Gaza (known as the "[[Gaza flotilla]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/07/06/george-jonas-using-lawfare-to-anchor-the-gaza-flotilla/ |title=George Jonas: Using lawfare to anchor the Gaza flotilla |publisher=National Post |date=7 November 2006 |accessdate=2013-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711232556/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/07/06/george-jonas-using-lawfare-to-anchor-the-gaza-flotilla/ |archivedate=11 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Canadian [[member of parliament|MP]] and former minister [[Irwin Cotler]], the use of law to delegitimize Israel is present in five areas: [[United Nations]], [[international law]], [[humanitarian law]], the struggle against [[racism]] and the struggle against [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Twersky |first=Mordechai I. |url=http://www.jpost.com/VideoArticles/Video/Article.aspx?id=221262 |title=Cotler warns of new strain in delegitimization of Israel |publisher=The Jerusalum Post |date=2011-05-19 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joshua Mintz]], writing in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' in September 2011, referring to the Israel fears of lawfare, says, "it's quite possible that Israel, at least within the legal landscape, may actually benefit from the Palestinian statehood bid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mintz |first=Josh |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=239692 |title=Rhetoric vs. reality: 'Lawfare' and the PA statehood bid |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Bloomfield writes that "Palestinian lawfare against Israel could further isolate the Jewish state" as well as raise issues regarding overseas travel for Israeli leaders who might fear arrest on war crimes charges. In addition, Bloomfield suggested "if [[Mahmoud Abbas|Abbas]] goes ahead with waging lawfare, he will open a new stage in the conflict that is likely to set back the cause of peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://washingtonjewishweek.com/main.asp?SectionID=31&amp;SubSectionID=49&amp;ArticleID=15776&amp;TM=17047.49 |title=Waging lawfare |work=Washington Jewish Week |date=2011-09-28 |accessdate=2013-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329103713/http://washingtonjewishweek.com/main.asp?SectionID=31&amp;SubSectionID=49&amp;ArticleID=15776&amp;TM=17047.49 |archivedate=29 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples of lawfare==
''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said in an editorial, regarding the [[José Padilla (prisoner)|Padilla]] case, "the lawyers suing for Padilla aren't interested in justice. They're practicing 'lawfare,' which is an effort to undermine the war on terror by making U.S. officials afraid to pursue it for fear of personal liability." Padilla was arrested in 2002 for planning to carry out a terror attack within the United States, was convicted and sentenced to prison, but has continued his legal battle via the [[ACLU]] and the National Litigation Project at [[Yale Law School]], and his case has been ruled on numerous times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203718504577181191271527180 |title='Lawfare' Loses Big |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-01-28 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable US official cited in connection with asserted lawfare is [[Henry Kissinger]]. Dr. Kissinger faced questioning and possible prosecution in France, again in Brazil, and then in England (the latter initiated by Spanish magistrate [[Baltasar Garzón]]) because of Kissinger's involvement as a Nixon Administration official with [[Operation Condor]].

Harvard law professor [[Jack Goldsmith]], known for his scholarship voicing opposition to the expansion of international human rights and universal jurisdiction, reveals in his book ''The Terror Presidency'' that Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] was concerned with the possibility of lawfare waged against Bush administration officials, and that Rumsfeld "could expect to be on top of the list".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Goldsmith |authorlink=Jack Goldsmith |title=The Terror Presidency: Law and Judgement Inside the Bush Administration |publisher=W.

Questions remain unresolved of the possibility of lawfare-type prosecution in Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.statewatch.org/cia/documents/milan-tribunal-19-us-citizens-sought.pdf |title=Milan tribunal document }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.44&amp;nbsp;MB)}}, published by [[Statewatch]], 22 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,622757,00.html] SpiegelOnline: Judgment Day May Be Approaching for CIA Agents(discussing German indictment of 13 CIA agents for rendition of Khaled el-Masri)&lt;/ref&gt; of CIA agents involved in international abduction known as [[extraordinary rendition by the United States]], and in Spain before Magistrate Garzón of the [[Bush Six]], American attorneys who created what ''The New York Times'' called "the legal framework to justify the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay".&lt;ref name=NYTimes2009-03-28&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/world/europe/29spain.html?_r=1&amp;hp |title=Spanish Court Weighs Inquiry on Torture for 6 Bush-Era Officials |date=2009-03-28 |author=Marlise Simons |work=[[The New York Times]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2009%2F03%2F29%2Fworld%2Feurope%2F29spain.html%3F_r%3D1%26hp&amp;date=2009-05-02 |archivedate=2009-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to June Teufel Dreyer, an example of lawfare are the activities of the [[People's Republic of China]] in the dispute of maritime borders with several [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] nations.&lt;ref name="Trouble in Fishing Waters: ASEAN, China, and the South China Sea"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fpri.org/articles/2014/05/trouble-fishing-waters-asean-china-and-south-china-sea | title=Trouble in Fishing Waters: ASEAN, China, and the South China Sea | publisher=Foreign Policy Research Institute | date=15 May 2014 | accessdate=15 May 2014 | author=Dreyer, June Teufel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion piece in the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' asserts that the United States is already dealing with "a variety of lawfare stratagems". In New York, anyone who reports an event as part of the "If You See Something, Say Something™" public awareness campaign is "protected from frivolous lawsuits" by the "Freedom to Report Terrorism Act", and journalists and authors who report on terrorism are protected from lawsuits by the "Libel Terrorism Protection Act", as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Lancman and Ehrenmfeld |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-09-22/news/30210003_1_mishor-adumim-palestinian-statehood-palestinian-companies/2 |title=Don't reward the Palestinians' 'lawfare' campaign with statehood: Make peace with Israel first |location=New York |newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |date=22 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629100315/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-09-22/news/30210003_1_mishor-adumim-palestinian-statehood-palestinian-companies/2 |archivedate=29 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lon Chaney London After Midnight Vampire Bat Cape.jpg|thumb|right|230px| [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] in ''[[London After Midnight (film)|London After Midnight]]'' (1927), one of the most sought-after lost films. The last known print was destroyed in the [[1965 MGM vault fire]], leaving only a set of production [[film stills|stills]] as a visual record.]]
A '''lost film''' is a [[feature film|feature]] or [[short film]] that is no longer known to exist in any studio archives, private collections, or public archives, such as the U.S. [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-film-preservation-board/documents/pub158.final_version_sept_2013.pdf  ''The Survival of American Silent Feature Films: 1912–1929'' by David Pierce, September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions==
During most of the 20th century, U.S. copyright law required at least one copy of every American film to be deposited at the [[Library of Congress]], at the time of [[copyright registration]], but the [[Librarian of Congress]] was not required to retain those copies: "Under the provisions of the act of March 4, 1909, authority is granted for the return to the claimant of copyright of such copyright deposits as are not required by the Library."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/reports/annual/archive/ar-1913.pdf Report of the Register of Copyrights for the Fiscal Year 1912–1913], Library of Congress, 1913, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Of American [[silent films]], far more have been lost than have survived, and of American [[sound film]]s made from 1927 to 1950, perhaps half have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Dave Kehr]] |coauthors= |title=Film Riches, Cleaned Up for Posterity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/movies/15restore.html |quote=It’s bad enough, to cite a common estimate, that 90 percent of all American silent films and 50 percent of American sound films made before 1950 appear to have vanished forever. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "lost film" can also be used in a literal sense for instances where footage of [[deleted scene]]s, unedited, and alternative versions of feature films are known to have been created, but can no longer be accounted for. Sometimes, a copy of a lost film is rediscovered. A film that has not been recovered in its entirety is called a partially lost film. For example, the 1922 film ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1922 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' was eventually discovered, but some of the footage is still missing.

==Stills==
Most film studios routinely had a [[still photographer]] with a large-format camera working on the set during production, taking pictures for potential later publicity use.&lt;ref name="Dzyak2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Dzyak|title=What I Really Want to Do on Set in Hollywood: A Guide to Real Jobs in the Film Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWY6Ej4fO1QC&amp;pg=PA303|year= 2010|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-87516-7|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high-quality photographic paper prints that resulted&amp;nbsp;– some produced in quantity for display use by theaters, others in smaller numbers for distribution to newspapers and magazines&amp;nbsp;– have preserved imagery from many otherwise lost films. In some cases, such as ''[[London After Midnight (film)|London After Midnight]]'', the surviving coverage is so extensive that an entire lost film can be reconstructed scene by scene in the form of still photographs. Stills have been used to stand in for missing footage when making new preservation prints of partially lost films.

==Reasons for film loss==

[[File:ThedaBara-Cleopatra.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Theda Bara]] in ''[[Cleopatra (1917 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1917).  Four hundred [[film still|still]]s and twenty seconds of the film itself are known to have survived.  Because a small loop of film exists, ''Cleopatra'' in the loose sense could be considered a "[[List of incomplete or partially lost films|partially lost film]]".]]
[[File:The First Men in the Moon (1919).jpg|thumb|right|275px|''[[The First Men in the Moon (1919 film)|The First Men in the Moon]]'' (1919), a lost British film, reputedly "the first movie to ever be based entirely on a famous science fiction novel".&lt;ref name = "Godwin"&gt;Robert Godwin, ''H.G. Wells The First Men in the Moon: the Story of the 1919 Film,'' [[Apogee Space Books]], {{ISBN|978-1926837-31-4}}- see [http://www.apogeeprime.com/prime/bookpages/9781926837314.html web page at Apogee books] (retrieved 5 May 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Most lost films are from the [[silent film]] and [[vitaphone|early talkie]] era, from about 1894 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentera.com/lost/index.html Silent Era: Presumed Lost&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Martin Scorsese]]'s [[The Film Foundation|Film Foundation]] estimates that more than 90% of American films made before 1929 are lost,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film-foundation.org/common/11004/aboutAboutUs.cfm?clientID=11004&amp;sid=2&amp;ssid=5 Film Preservation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312021638/http://www.film-foundation.org/common/11004/aboutAboutUs.cfm?clientID=11004&amp;sid=2&amp;ssid=5 |date=March 12, 2013 }}, The Film Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Library of Congress]] estimates that 75% of all silent films are lost forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thewire.com/culture/2013/12/most-americas-silent-films-are-lost-forever/355775/ | title=Most of America's Silent Films Are Lost Forever | publisher=[[The Wire]] | date=December 4, 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2014 | author=Ohlheiser, Abby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest cause of silent film loss was intentional destruction, as silent films were perceived as having little or no commercial value after the end of the silent era by 1930. Film preservationist [[Robert A. Harris]] has said, "Most of the early films did not survive because of wholesale junking by the studios. There was no thought of ever saving these films. They simply needed vault space and the materials were expensive to house."&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Harris, [http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/rah.htm public hearing statement] to the National Film Preservation Board of the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., February 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other early motion pictures are lost because the [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]] used for nearly all [[35 mm film|35 mm]] [[negative (photography)|negatives]] and [[release print|prints]] made before 1952 is highly flammable.  When in very badly deteriorated condition and improperly stored (e.g., in a sun-baked shed), nitrate film can and will [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously combust]].  Fires have destroyed entire archives of films.  For example, a [[1937 Fox vault fire|storage vault fire in 1937]] destroyed all the original negatives of [[Fox Film|Fox Pictures]]' pre-1935 films.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=5w0r8YKan04C&amp;pg=PA339 $45,000 Fire Drives Families From Homes in Little Ferry]", ''[[Bergen Evening Record]]'', July 9, 1937, p. 1. Quoted by Richard Koszarski in ''Fort Lee: The Film Town'', Indiana University Press, 2005, pp. 339–341. {{ISBN|978-0-86196-652-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[1965 MGM vault fire]] resulted in the loss of hundreds more silent films and early talkies.

[[File:Marx Brothers 1921.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Humor Risk]]'' (1921), now long-lost, was the first [[Marx Brothers]] film.  Pictured in a photograph the same year, from (left to right), are [[Zeppo Marx|Zeppo]], [[Groucho Marx|Groucho]], [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]], and [[Chico Marx|Chico]].]]

Nitrate film is chemically unstable and over time can decay into a sticky mass or a powder akin to [[gunpowder]]. This process can be very unpredictable: some nitrate film from the 1890s is still in good condition today, while some much later nitrate had to be scrapped as unsalvageable when it was barely 20 years old. Much depends on the environment in which it is stored. Ideal conditions of low temperature, low humidity, and adequate ventilation can preserve nitrate film for centuries, but in practice, the storage conditions were usually far from ideal. When a film on nitrate base is said to have been "preserved", this almost always means simply that it has been copied onto [[Cellulose acetate film|safety film]] or, more recently, [[Digitizing|digitized]]; both methods result in some loss of quality.

[[Eastman Kodak]] introduced a nonflammable 35&amp;nbsp;mm film stock in spring 1909. However, the [[plasticizer]]s used to make the film flexible evaporated too quickly, making the film dry and brittle, causing splices to part and perforations to tear. By 1911, the major American film studios were back to using nitrate stock.&lt;ref&gt;Eileen Bowser, ''The Transformation of Cinema 1907–1915'', Charles Scribner's Sons 1990, p. 74–75. {{ISBN|0-684-18414-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Safety film" was relegated to sub-35&amp;nbsp;mm formats such as [[16 mm]] and [[8 mm film|8 mm]] until improvements were made in the late 1940s.

[[File:Tenderloin poster.jpg|thumb|right|225px|''[[Tenderloin (film)|Tenderloin]]'' (1928), starring [[Dolores Costello]], was the second [[Vitaphone]] feature to have talking sequences. It is considered a lost film because only its soundtrack is known to have survived.]]

Some pre-1931 sound films made by [[Warner Bros.]] and [[First National Pictures|First National]] have been lost because they used a [[Vitaphone|sound-on-disc]] system with a separate soundtrack on special phonograph records. If some of a film's soundtrack discs could not be found in the 1950s when 16&amp;nbsp;mm [[sound-on-film]] [[reduction print]]s of early "talkies" were being made for inclusion in [[Associated Artists Productions|television syndication]] packages, that film's chances of survival plummeted: many sound-on-disc films have survived only by way of those 16&amp;nbsp;mm prints.

[[File:GoldDiggersBroadway2.jpg|thumb|left|215px|''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' (1929), the third [[Warner Bros.]] film shot in [[Technicolor]], is a "[[List of incomplete or partially lost films|partially lost film]]".]]

Before the eras of [[sound film]], [[television]] and later [[home video]], films were viewed as having little future value when their theatrical runs ended. Thus,  many were deliberately destroyed to save the space and cost of storage; many were recycled for their [[silver]] content. Many [[Technicolor]] two-color negatives from the 1920s and 1930s were thrown out when the studios refused to reclaim their films, still being held by Technicolor in its vaults. Some used prints were sold to scrap dealers and ultimately cut up into short segments for use with small, hand-cranked 35&amp;nbsp;mm movie projectors, which were sold as a toy for showing brief excerpts from Hollywood movies at home.

As a consequence of this widespread lack of care, the work of many early filmmakers and performers has made its way to the present in fragmentary form. A high-profile example is the case of [[Theda Bara]]. One of the best-known actresses of the early silent era, she made 40 films, but only six are now known to exist. [[Clara Bow]] was equally celebrated in her heyday, but 20 of her 57 films are completely lost, and another five are incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarabow.net Clara Bow.net]&lt;/ref&gt;  Once-popular stage actresses such as [[Pauline Frederick]] and [[Elsie Ferguson]], who made the jump to silent films, are now largely forgotten with a minimal archive to represent their careers; fewer than 10 movies exist from Frederick's 1915–1928 work, and Ferguson has just two surviving films, one from 1919 and her only talkie from 1930.

[[File:Oregon trailposter.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[John Wayne]] in the lost Western ''[[The Oregon Trail (1936 film)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1936)]]

This is preferable to the fate of the stage actress and Bara rival [[Valeska Suratt]], whose entire film career has been lost. Western hero [[William Farnum]], a Fox player like Bara and Suratt, was one of the screen's big Western actors rivaling the likes of William S. Hart, Tom Mix, and [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]]. Farnum has about three of his Fox films extant. Other male performers, such as [[Francis X. Bushman]] and [[William Desmond (actor)|William Desmond]], had numerous film credits, but films made in their heyday are missing due to junking, neglect, or studios being defunct. Nevertheless, unlike Suratt and Bara, these men continued working into the sound era and even into television, thus their later performances can be observed and appreciated.

Occasional exceptions exist; almost all of [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s films from his entire career have survived, as well as extensive amounts of unused footage dating back to 1916. The exceptions are ''[[A Woman of the Sea]]'' (which he destroyed himself as a tax writeoff) and one of his early Keystone films, ''[[Her Friend the Bandit]]'' (see ''[[Unknown Chaplin]]''). The filmography of [[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] is nearly complete, as many of his early [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph]] films were deposited by the company in [[paper print]] form at the [[Library of Congress]]. Many of Griffith's feature-film works of the 1910s and 1920s found their way to the film collection at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in the 1930s, and were preserved under the auspices of curator [[Iris Barry]]. [[Mary Pickford]]'s filmography is nearly complete: her early years were spent with Griffith, and she gained control of her own productions in the late 1910s and early 1920s. She also backtracked to as many of her Zukor-controlled early [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous Players]] films as were salvageable. Stars such as Chaplin and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] enjoyed stupendous popularity, and their films were reissued over and over throughout the silent era, meaning prints of their films were likely to surface decades later. Pickford, Chaplin, [[Harold Lloyd]], and [[Cecil B. DeMille]] were early champions of [[film preservation]], though Lloyd lost a good number of his silent works in a vault fire in the early 1940s.

==Later lost films==
An improved 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[Cellulose acetate film|safety film]] was introduced in 1949. Since safety film is much more stable than nitrate film,  comparatively few films were lost after about 1950. However, color fading of certain color stocks and [[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the "vinegar syndrome"|vinegar syndrome]] threaten the preservation of films made since about this time.

Most mainstream movies from the 1950s onwards survive today, but several early [[pornographic film]]s and some [[B movie]]s are lost. In most cases, these obscure films go unnoticed and unknown, but some films by noted [[cult film|cult]] directors have been lost, as well:
* Several films by [[Kenneth Anger]] from across his career have been lost for a variety of reasons.
* [[Ed Wood]]'s [[1972 in film|1972]] film, ''[[The Undergraduate]]'', has been lost. Wood's [[1971 in film|1971]] film ''[[Necromania]]'' was believed lost for years, until an edited version resurfaced at a yard sale in 1992, followed by a complete unedited print in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/?041025ta_talk_paumgarten New Yorker:In the Vault]&lt;/ref&gt; A complete print of the previously lost Wood pornographic film ''[[The Young Marrieds (film)|The Young Marrieds]]'' was discovered in 2004. His [[1970 in film|1970]] film ''[[Take It Out In Trade]]'' was thought to exist only in fragments without sound, released on home video as ''[[Take It Out in Trade: The Outtakes]]'' in 1995, until the release of a scanned 16mm theatrical print on Blu-ray in 2018.
* [[Tom Graeff]]'s first feature film, ''[[The Noble Experiment (film)|The Noble Experiment]]'' (1955), in which director/writer Graeff plays a misunderstood genius scientist, was considered lost until found by [[Elle Schneider]] during the production of a documentary about Graeff entitled ''[[The Boy from Out of This World]]''.
* Most of [[Andy Milligan]]'s early films are considered lost.
* Many short [[sponsored film]]s—films made for educational, training, or religious purposes—from the 1940s through the 1970s are also lost, as they were thought of as disposable or upgradable.
* Some of [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Sammo Hung]]'s first roles, including ''[[Big and Little Wong Tin Bar]]'', was considered lost until a 2016 discovery and re-release.
* The first three films of noted Finnish melodrama actor and director [[Teuvo Tulio]] were lost, along with several other films that were of interest at least for historians of Finnish cinema, when the film depository of the company [[Adams Filmi]] burned down in Helsinki in 1959.
* Sometimes, only certain aspects of films may be lost. Early color films such as [[Lucien Hubbard]]'s ''[[The Mysterious Island (1929 film)|The Mysterious Island]]'' and [[John G. Adolfi]]'s ''[[The Show of Shows]]'' exist only partially or not at all in color because the copies that were made of the film that exist were created on black-and-white stock. (See [[List of early color feature films]].)
* Two three-dimensional films from 1954, ''[[Top Banana (film)|Top Banana]]'' and ''[[Southwest Passage]]'', exist only in their flat form because only one print, made for either the left or right eye, exists.

==Lost film soundtracks==
Some films produced in 1926–1931 using the [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] system, in which the soundtrack is separate from the film, are now considered lost because the soundtrack discs were lost or destroyed, while the picture elements survive. Conversely, and more commonly, some early sound films survive only as sets of soundtrack discs, with the picture elements completely missing (e.g., 1930's ''[[The Man from Blankley's]]'', starring [[John Barrymore]]) or surviving only in fragmentary form (e.g., ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Rogue Song]]'' (1930), two highly popular and profitable early musicals in two-color [[Technicolor]]).

Many [[stereophonic sound]]tracks from the early to mid-1950s that were either played in interlock on a 35&amp;nbsp;mm fullcoat magnetic reel or single-strip magnetic film (such as Fox's four-track magnetic, which became the standard of mag stereophonic sound) are now lost. Films such as ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'', ''[[The Caddy]]'', ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'', ''[[The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T]]'', and ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' that were originally available with 3-track, magnetic sound are now available only with a monophonic optical soundtrack. The chemistry behind adhering magnetic particles to the tri-acetate film base eventually caused the [[autocatalytic]] breakdown of the film (vinegar syndrome). As long as studios had a monaural optical negative that could be printed, studio executives felt no need to preserve the stereophonic versions of the soundtracks.

Occasionally, prints of films considered lost have been rediscovered. An example is the 1910 version of ''[[Frankenstein (1910 film)|Frankenstein]]'' which was believed lost for decades until the existence of a print (which had been in the hands of an unwitting collector for years) was discovered in the 1970s. A print of ''[[Richard III (1912 film)|Richard III]]'' (1912) was found in 1996 and restored by the [[American Film Institute]].  In 2013, an early [[Mary Pickford]] film, ''[[Their First Misunderstanding]]'', notable for being the first film in which she was credited by name, was found in a [[New Hampshire]] barn and donated to [[Keene State College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mason|first1=Anthony|title=Lost Mary Pickford movie discovered in N.H. barn|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lost-mary-pickford-movie-discovered-in-nh-barn/|accessdate=24 June 2014|work=CBS News|date=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Beyond the Rocks (film)|Beyond the Rocks]]'' (1922) with [[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Rudolph Valentino]] was considered a lost film for several decades. Swanson lamented the loss of this and other films in her 1980 memoirs, but optimistically concluded, "I do not believe these films are gone forever". In 2000, a print was found in the Netherlands and restored by the Nederlands Filmmuseum and the Haghefilm Conservation. It turned up among about 2000 rusty film canisters donated by an eccentric Dutch collector, Joop van Liempd, of Haarlem. It was given its first modern screening in 2005, and has since been aired on [[Turner Classic Movies]].

In the early 2000s, the 1927 German film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''—which had been distributed in many different edits over the years—was restored to as close to the original version as possible by reinstating edited footage and using computer technology to repair damaged footage. At that point, however, approximately a quarter of the original film footage was considered lost, according to [[Kino Video]]'s DVD release of the restored film. On July 1, 2008, [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] film experts announced that a copy of the film had been discovered in the archives of the film museum Museo del Cine in [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]], which contained all but one of the scenes still missing from the 2002 restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chud.com/articles/articles/15424/1/METROPOLIS-REBORN/Page1.html|title=METROPOLIS REBORN|last=Faraci|first=Devin|date=July 3, 2008|work=CHUD|page=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705092003/http://chud.com/articles/articles/15424/1/METROPOLIS-REBORN/Page1.html|archivedate=July 5, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.de/12847/20080702/ |title=Lost scenes of 'Metropolis' discovered in Argentina |date=2 July 2008 |work=The Local |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820025015/http://www.thelocal.de/12847/20080702/ |archivedate=August 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film now has been restored very close to its premiere version. The restoration process is featured in ''Metropolis refundada'' documentary.

In 2010, digital copies of ten early American films were presented to the [[Library of Congress]] by the [[Boris Yeltsin Presidential Library]], the first film installment from the Russian state archives to be repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/21/us.russia.found.films/?hpt=T2 |title='Lost' silent movies found in Russia, returned to U.S. |date=October 21, 2010 |accessdate=February 11, 2011 |publisher=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television material existing on film has sometimes been recovered. The 1951 pilot of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' was long believed lost, but in 1990 the widow of one of the actors, Pepito Pérez (who played Pepito the Clown), found a copy. It has since been shown on television. Sometimes a film believed lost in its original state has been restored, either through the process of [[Film colorization|colorization]], or other restoration methods. ''[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]'', the original 1964 [[television pilot|pilot film]] for ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', survived only in a black-and-white print until 1987, when a film archivist found an unmarked (mute) 35mm reel in a Hollywood film laboratory with the negative trims of the unused scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Furmanek, [http://monsterkidclassichorrorforum.yuku.com/reply/275869/t/The-Cage-1966-.html#reply-275869 post to Classic Horror Film Board], April 21, 2008. The reconstruction used the soundtrack of Roddenberry's 16mm print for those scenes otherwise without sound.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a number of videotaped television programmes, previously thought lost (see [[wiping]]) have been recovered as overseas [[Kinescope]] film prints from private collectors and various other sources over the years.  For example, nine lost episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' were discovered in storage at a television broadcasting station in Nigeria in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-24467337|title=Doctor Who: Yeti classic among episodes found in Nigeria|date=October 11, 2013|accessdate=July 5, 2018|publisher=bbc.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stock footage ==
Several films that would otherwise be entirely lost survive in the form of [[stock footage]] used for later films.

The [[Universal Pictures]] feature film ''[[The Cat Creeps]]'' (1930) is a lost film and its only remaining footage was included in a Universal [[short film]] called ''[[Boo! (film)|Boo!]]'' (1932). However, UCLA still has a copy of the soundtrack. The [[James Cagney]] film ''[[Winner Take All (1932 film)|Winner Take All]]'' (1932) used scenes from the early talkie ''[[Queen of the Night Clubs]]'' (1929) starring [[Texas Guinan]]. While ''Queen of the Night Clubs'' was not a lost film in 1932, no prints of the film have survived through the decades, and only that footage included in ''Winner Take All'' remains.

Actress turned gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] made her screen debut in a Fox Film called ''[[The Battle of Hearts]]'' (1916). The star of the film was [[William Farnum]], then at the beginning of his long Fox contract. 26 years later in 1942 Hopper produced her short series ''Hedda Hopper's Hollywood #2''. In the short, Hopper, Farnum, her son [[William Hopper]], and William's wife Jane Gilbert view portions of ''Battle of Hearts''. These brief portions of that movie survive within the Hopper documentary. More than likely Hopper had an entire print of the movie in 1942. However, like many early Fox films, ''Battle of Hearts'' is now lost or missing.

One of Charlie Chaplin's best-known works, the 1925 silent film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'', was re-released in 1942 to include a musical track and narration by Chaplin himself. The reissue would end up having the [[Unintended consequences|unintentional result]] of preserving the film, as the original 1925 film (though generally not considered a lost film) shows noticeable degradation of image and missing frames, damage not in evidence in the 1942 version.

The Polish film ''{{Interlanguage link multi|O czym się nie mówi|pl|3=O czym się nie mówi (film 1939)}}'' from 1939 contains three short fragments of ''Arabella'' from 1917, one of [[Pola Negri]]'s early films, which later became lost.

==In film==
Several films have been made with lost film fragments incorporated into the work. ''[[Decasia]]'' (2002) used nothing but decaying film footage as an abstract tone poem of light and darkness, much like Peter Delpeut's more historical ''[[Lyrisch Nitraat]]'' (''Lyrical Nitrate'', 1990) which contained only footage from canisters found stored in an Amsterdam cinema. In 1993, Delpeut released ''[[The Forbidden Quest]]'', combining early film footage and archival photographs with new material to tell the fictional story of an ill-fated Antarctic expedition.

The 2016 documentary ''[[Dawson City: Frozen Time]]'', about the history of [[Dawson City, Canada]] and the 1978 discovery of previously lost silent films there, incorporates parts of many of those films.

The [[Fox Film Corporation]] feature ''[[Charlie Chan Carries On]]'' (1931) only exists in a [[film trailer|trailer]] made to promote the film, and in a [[Spanish language]] version ''Eran Trece'' ("They were thirteen").

[[Peter Jackson]]'s [[mockumentary]] ''[[Forgotten Silver]]'' purports to show recovered footage of early films. Instead, the filmmakers used newly shot film sequences treated to look like lost film.

In [[Robert Rodriguez]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' double feature, both the ''[[Planet Terror]]'' and ''[[Death Proof]]'' segments have references to missing reels, used as [[plot device]]s.

[[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Masters of Horror]]'' episode [[John Carpenter's Cigarette Burns|"Cigarette Burns"]] deals with the search for a fictional lost film, ''La Fin Absolue Du Monde'' (''The Absolute End of the World'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4330">'''Louis Morton Hacker''' (March 17, 1899 - March 22, 1987) was an American [[economic historian]], Professor of Economics at [[Columbia University]], and founding dean of its [[School of General Studies]], and author. He is known as leading proponent of adult education.&lt;ref name="NYT 1987"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/23/obituaries/louis-m-hacker-88-educator.html Louis M. Hacker, 88 Educator]," ''New York Times,'' March 23, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Hacker, son of Morris and Celia (Waxelbaum) Hacker, was born and raised in [[New York City]] in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], a neighborhood in Brooklyn. After attending the [[Boys High School (Brooklyn)|Brooklyn Boys' High School]], he studied at [[Columbia College, Columbia University]] and [[Columbia University]], where he obtained his AB in 1922, and his MA in 1923.&lt;ref name="WAA 1935"&gt;''Who's who Among North American Authors,'' Vol. 6, 1935, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation in 1923 Hacker started as assistant editor at the ''[[New International Encyclopedia]],'' and was contributing editor at the ''New International YearBook.'' In 1935 he started as lifelong academic career at [[Columbia University]] as lecturer in economics.&lt;ref name="DH 1938"&gt;Durward Howes. ''America's Young Men,'' Volume 3. Richard Blank Publishing Company, 1938. p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 he became Assistant Professor, in 1944 Associate Professor, and in 1948 full Professor. After his retirement in 1967 he was appointed Professor Emeritus. In 1952 he was the first dean of its [[School of General Studies]], where he served until 1958.&lt;ref name="NYT 1987"/&gt;

In 1937 he had been Visiting Professor at the University Wisconsin,&lt;ref name="DH 1938"/&gt; in 1939 at the Ohio State University, in 1945 at Utah State Agricultural College, in 1953 at the University Hawaii, and in 1970 at the University Puget Sound. In 1948 he had been appointed [[Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth Professor of American History]] for one year at the [[University of Oxford]]. In addition to the scientific work, he was involved in the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].

Hacker died in [[Le Roy, New York]] in 1987 at the age of 88.&lt;ref name="NYT 1987"/&gt;

== Work ==
Hacker was a leading proponent of adult education. In an interview he had explained: 
:"Many students come to us 10, 20, 30 years after graduation from high school... They are intelligent and serious but they could not pass a college-entrance examination after such a long interruption of their studies. They want to try a college course, perhaps only one or two, before deciding whether they can go on. We let them try. Why not?"&lt;ref&gt;Quote from interview, cited in 1987 obituary in New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hacker's research interests were in the field of American history and its social economic development, as well as the life and work of some of its greatest entrepreneurs such as Andrew Carnegie, Alexander Hamilton and Joseph M. Proskauer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5832">'''Louis Pierre Édouard, Baron Bignon''' (3 January 1771 in [[La Mailleraye-sur-Seine]] – 6 January 1841) was a  French diplomat and historian.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson's (revised) Universal Cyclopaedia  1886   Volume 1 - Page 458 "Bignon (Louis Pierre Édouard), a French statesman and historian, born at La Mailleraye Jan. 3, 1771. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1817, and became a peer of France in ... Pop. in 1870,1237; in 1880, 3552; in 1884, 5902."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[Image:Bignon, Louis.jpg|thumb|Louis de Bignon]]
Louis de Bignon was born at [[La Mailleraye-sur-Seine]], [[Seine-Maritime]], the son of a dyer. Although he had received a good education, he served throughout the early part of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] without rising above the rank of private. In 1797, however, the attention of [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]], then minister of foreign affairs, was called to his exceptional abilities by [[General Huet]], and he was attached to the diplomatic service.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After serving in the legations in Switzerland and the [[Cisalpine Republic]], he was appointed in 1799 attach to the French legation at Berlin, of which three years later he became ''[[chargé d'affaires]]''. As minister-plenipotentiary at [[Kassel|Cassel]], between the years 1804 and 1806, he took a prominent share in the formation of the [[confederation of the Rhine]]; and after the [[battle of Jena]] he returned to [[Prussia]] as administrator of the public domains and finances. He filled a similar function in Austria after the [[battle of Wagram]]. At the end of 1810 he became French resident at [[Warsaw]] and was for a couple of years supreme in the affairs of the [[grand duchy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The preparation of a constitution for Poland, on which he was engaged, was, however, interrupted by the events of 1812. Bignon, after a short imprisonment at the hands of the allies, returned to France in time to witness the downfall of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. During the [[Hundred Days]] he once more entered Napoleon's service, and, after the [[battle of Waterloo]], as minister of foreign affairs under the executive commission, it was he who signed the [[Convention of St. Cloud]] of the 3rd of July 1815, by which Paris was handed over to the allies.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Bignon did not re-enter public life until 1817, when he was elected to the chamber of deputies, in which he sat until 1830, consistent in his opposition to the reactionary policy of successive governments. His great reputation and his diplomatic experience gave a special weight to the attacks which he published on the policy of the continental allies, two of his works attracting special attention, ''Du congrès de Troppau ou Examen des prétentions des monarchies absolues à l’égard de la monarchie constitutionnelle de Naples'' (Paris, 1821), and ''Les Cabinets et les peuples depuis 1815 jusqu’à la fin de 1822'' (Paris, 1822).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The [[July Revolution]], which brought his party into power, only led to a very temporary resumption of office by Bignon. He was for a few weeks minister of foreign affairs in the first government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], and again for a few weeks minister of public instruction. But the idea of making him responsible for the foreign policy of France could not be realized owing to the necessity under which Louis Philippe lay of courting the goodwill of the powers, whom Bignon had offended by his outspoken writings.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Elected deputy in 1831&lt;ref&gt;Marian Kukiel Czartoryski and European Unity: 1770-1861  1955 - Page 204 "On December 3, 1832, Baron Louis de Bignon, once Napoleon's minister to Warsaw and Vilna, moved an amendment to the address warmly recommending to the government the Polish cause; it was voted by a great majority."&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the chamber of peers in 1839, he withdrew for the most part from politics to devote himself to his great work, the ''Histoire de France sous Napoleon'' (10 vols. 1829–1838, then 4 posthumous vols., 1847–1850). This history, while suffering the limitations of all contemporaneous narratives, contains much that does not exist elsewhere, and is one of the best-known sources for the later histories of Napoleon's reign. In his will, Napoleon had granted Bignon 100,000 francs and charged him "to write the history of French diplomacy from 1792 to 1815," although the money was never delivered {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Olson]], [[Sandra Miesel]], ''The Da Vinci hoax: exposing the errors in The Da Vinci code'', Ignatius Press, 2004, p.254, 329 pp, {{ISBN|978-1-58617-034-9}}, retrieved via [https://books.google.com/books?id=cUqsPMVOpQgC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;dq=Lynn+Picknett+-inauthor:%22Lynn+Picknett%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Lynn%20Picknett&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born in [[Folkestone|Folkestone, Kent, England]], in April 1947, Picknett grew up in an alleged [[haunted house]] in [[York]], attending Park Grove Junior School and [[Queen Anne Grammar School]]. After graduating from university with an Upper 2nd (hons) degree in English Literature, she briefly became a teacher, a shop assistant, and a [[stand-up comic]] before moving to London in 1971 to join [[Marshall Cavendish Publications]] as a trainee sub-editor.

In the 1980s, she was Deputy Editor on ''[[The Unexplained (magazine)|The Unexplained]]'' and contributor to many other publications. She was also a regular contributor on various radio shows, including Michael van Straten and [[Clive Bull]]'s on LBC and Talk Radio. She was also a television presenter for both [[Anglia Television|Anglia]] and [[Southern TV]].

In 1990 she was guest curator for the [[Royal Photographic Society]]'s exhibition ''The Unexplained at Bath'', performing the same function in 1999 for the [[National Museum of Photography, Film and Television at Bradford]].

In the early 1990s, she teamed up with fellow researcher and writer [[Clive Prince]]. Their first book, ''Turin Shroud: How Leonardo da Vinci Fooled History'', was the first mainstream work to reveal how all the so-called miraculous characteristics of the [[Turin Shroud]] could easily be reproduced only using a [[pinhole camera]] (camera obscura), and argued that [[Leonardo da Vinci]] not only faked it, but used his own face for the model of [[Jesus]], overlooking the fact that the first exhibition of the Shroud of Turin, authentic or not, was in 1357, almost one century before the birth of Da Vinci.

Their 1997 ''[[The Templar Revelation]]'' was credited by [[Dan Brown]], both in ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and in the 2006 court case (Baigent &amp; Leigh v Random House), as the main inspiration for his novel.

Between 1999 and his death in 2003, she and Clive Prince worked with Stephen Prior, described in book [[blurb]] as "a historian specialising in intelligence matters".

Picknett and Prince perform most of the research for their books themselves, though they are sometimes helped by several friends and fellow researchers. They have credited Keith Prince as a main contributor for their work on the Turin Shroud, [[Philip Coppens (author)|Philip Coppens]] in ''[[The Stargate Conspiracy]]'' (published in 1999), and Robert Brydon for their work on ''[[Rudolf Hess]]'' (titled ''Double Standards: The Rudolf Hess Cover-Up'' and published in 2001).

Picknett, as well as Prince, makes a brief appearance in the film ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]''. The pair appear on a London bus as the protagonists are travelling to the [[Temple Church]], off [[Fleet Street]] in central London. Robert Langdon ([[Tom Hanks]]) leaves his seat to join Sophie ([[Audrey Tautou]]) at the back of the bus, and Picknett and Prince are seen sitting on the left.

'''Madjedbebe''' or '''Malakunanja II''' is a rock shelter in [[Arnhem Land]], in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]].

This date sets a new minimum age for: the arrival of humans in Australia, the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa and the subsequent interactions of modern humans with [[Neanderthals]] and [[Denisovans]]. More than 1500 items have been found in the shelter, including stone tools and grinding stones, [[ochre]], and charcoal. Some of these were buried more than 2.5 metres below the surface. The shelter also includes faded paintings on the walls. The paintings are drawn with ochre. Archaeobotanical investigations have demonstrated a clear exploitation of plant foods, including: seeds, tubers and [[pandanus]] nuts. Fuel wood was also sourced from a local eucalyptus and moonson vine thicket forest.

'''Mikhail (Gobron) Sabinin''' ({{lang-ka|მიხეილ [გობრონ] საბინინი}}, {{lang-ru|Михаил Павлович [Геброн] Сабинин}}) (1845–1900) was a [[Russia|Russo]]-[[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] monk, historian of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] and [[icon]] painter.

He was born to the Russian priest from [[Tver]], Pavel Sabinin, and a Georgian woman. Educated at the [[Tiflis]] gymnasium in the 1860s, he then attended [[St. Petersburg Theologian Academy]] and attained to a [[Magister (degree)|magister degree]] for his work ''History of the Georgian Church until the End of the 6th Century'' ("История грузинской церкви до конца VI в." [СПб., 1877]), the first comprehensive treatment of the subject produced in Russian. He travelled in several regions of Georgia, studying monuments of Christian architecture, copying frescos and icons, recording legends and collecting manuscripts. In St. Petersburg, he was tonsured a monk and given the name Gobron after a 10th-century [[Gobron|Georgian saint]]. In 1882, he published ''The Paradise of Georgia'' (საქართველოს სამოთხე; St. Petersburg, 1882), a voluminous lithographed edition of biographies of important Georgian Orthodox Christian saints. In the 1880s, he served at the famous [[Iviron Monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]]. In 1882 he published also ''[[Eustathius of Mtskheta|The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta]]''.

In 1898, he clashed with the office of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] [[exarchate]] at Tiflis over his criticism of [[Russification]] and was removed from Georgia to [[Moscow]] where he died of [[pneumonia]] on May 10, 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.pravoslavie.ru/cgi-bin/sykon/client/display.pl?sid=374&amp;did=1079 Важа Кикнадзе.

'''Mitrotsavam''' (Mitrolsavam, Mitra Ulsavam) is a Hindu festival worshipping the Sun god [[Surya]], whose orderly traversal of the sky is ensured by [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]]-[[Varuna]], the guardians of cosmic order ({{IAST|[[ṛtá]]}}) in [[Rig Veda]] 8.25.8 and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;THE CALL OF THE VEDAS by A C Bose, Bombay, Bhavan's Book University, 1970. 3rd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On Mitrotsavam, devotees worship the Sun for prosperity, health and courage. [[Surya]] is glorified in Vedic mantras as the expeller of darkness and evil. The most sacred [[Gayatri]] mantra, composed by Sage [[Vishvamitra]], worships the Sun as Savita. Additionally, the Sun is honored by recitation of the [[Aditya Hridayam]]&amp;mdash; according to a legend in the [[Ramayana]], Lord [[Rama]] was initiated into the worship of Surya with that hymn, which then gave him strength and the power to vanquish evil. Devotees also perform the [[Surya Namaskara]], recite 108 names of Surya, and pray for help to ward off evil, infirmity and disease. At the same time, devotees extoll Mitra (Vedic Mitra-Varuna) as the ''[[Pratyaksha]] devata'', the ''{{IAST|māyā́}}''-minded, far-sighted, thousand-eyed light and fire of the Sun, worship of whom is considered especially beneficial for ailments of the eye and mind.

In 2008 Mitrotsavam fell on Thursday, December 25.

'''Olena Apanovych''' ({{lang-uk|Олена Михайлівна Апанович}}) (9 November 1919 – 21 February 2000) was a Ukrainian historian, researcher of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Zaporozhian Cossackdom]].

==Biography==
Olena Apanovych was born in Melekes of [[Simbirsk]] Governorate (now [[Dimitrovgrad, Russia|Dimitrovgrad]] of [[Ulyanovsk Oblast]]), [[Russia]], in the family of the railroad clerk. By the memories of her relatives her mother gave birth to Olena in the railroad car. Her father was of [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] peasants (hence the Belarusian last name ''Apanovich'' and her mother was of the small-time [[Polish nobility]] ancestry. She spent all her childhood in [[Manchuria]] (the North-East of [[China]]) where her father worked. Her family was deported from [[China]] by the Japanese and settle in [[Kharkiv]] in 1933, where Olena finished the high-school. Olena's mother soon died and father was repressed in 1939 by false accusations.

In 1937 she entered the ''All-Union Institute of Journalism'' in [[Moscow]] but the school was soon closed and Apanovych returned to [[Kharkiv]] where she graduated from the Pedagogical Institute (Faculty of Russian language and literature) soon before the beginning of [[Second World War]]. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|onset of the German invasion]] she was evacuated to [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Bashkiria]]. From May, 1944, Olena worked in Central State [[Archive]] of Ukraine in [[Kiev]] as researcher and took part in preparation of many historical documents for publishing.

In 1950 Olena Apanovich defended her dissertation for the [[Kandidat of Science]] degree (roughly a [[Ph.D.]] equivalent)  on [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] participation in Russo-Turkish war of 1768-1774 and joined the [[Institute of History of Ukraine|Institute of History]] of the [[Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] as a leading expert on [[Cossack]]dom. During the period of 1950 - 1972 she founded archaeological expeditions to the places, connected with Zaporozhian Cossackdom history, published many scientific works, made full register of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] memory places.

From 1972 after being fired for political reasons from the Institute of History, Apanovych worked in  the Central Scientific Library of [[National Academy of Science of Ukraine|The Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]], making significant contribution in manuscript research. In early eighties the historian was often invited as consultant for documentary and fiction films on Ukrainian Cossackdom.

In 1991 Olena Apanovich became the member of the [[Writer's Union of Ukraine]], in 1994 was awarded the prize named after [[Taras Shevchenko|T.Shevchenko]], in 1995 - [[Antonovych prize]] in USA.

'''Oscar Efrén Reyes''' (June 13, 1896, [[Baños de Agua Santa|Baños]] – December 6, 1966, [[Quito]]), was a historian, journalist, politician, researcher and an [[Ecuadorians|Ecuadorian]] teacher. He is remembered for his teachings as well as his historic research of Ecuador and America.{{clarify|date=February 2017}}

==Early life and education==
Reyes was born in [[Baños de Agua Santa|Baños]], [[Tungurahua Province]] on June 13, 1896, the only child of María Petronila Reyes Noboa.&lt;ref name="la-hora-oscar-efren-reyes"&gt;{{cite news |date=12 August 2008 |title=Oscar Efrén Reyes |url=http://lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/758692/-1/Oscar_Efr%C3%A9n_Reyes.html |language=Spanish |newspaper=La Hora Nacional |location= |access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aviles-pino-encyclopedia-oscar-efren-reyes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enciclopediadelecuador.com/personajes-historicos/prof-oscar-efren-reyes/ |title=Prof. Oscar Efrén Reyes |last=Avilés Pino |first=Efrén |website=Enciclopedia del Ecuador |language=Spanish |access-date= 14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perez-pimentel-encyclopedia-oscar-efren-reyes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diccionariobiograficoecuador.com/tomos/tomo19/r4.htm |title=OSCAR EFREN REYES |last=Pérez Pimentel |first=Rodolfo |website=Diccionario Bibliografico del Ecuador |language=Spanish |access-date= 14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a ''[[arriero]]'' (muleteer).&lt;ref name="perez-pimentel-encyclopedia-oscar-efren-reyes" /&gt; His grandparents, Francisco Reyes Hidalgo and Regina Noboa, owned a farm called ''La Escudilla''.&lt;ref name="la-hora-oscar-efren-reyes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="perez-pimentel-encyclopedia-oscar-efren-reyes" /&gt; &lt;!-- Due to his mother's difficult economic situation both she and Reyes would suffer from lack of food. [Should this be removed as promotional/unnecessary?] --&gt; I&lt;ref name="la-hora-oscar-efren-reyes" /&gt; After the death of his mother in 1909 due to cancer,&lt;ref name="perez-pimentel-encyclopedia-oscar-efren-reyes" /&gt; he was placed in the care of his aunt and uncle, Rosita Romo de Reyes and Juan Reyes Noboa.&lt;ref name="la-hora-oscar-efren-reyes" /&gt;

Eventually he received education in grammar and mathematics, paid for by Dominican parish priest Fray Juan Halflants, who had admired the literary knowledge of Reyes at the age of 15.&lt;ref name="perez-pimentel-encyclopedia-oscar-efren-reyes" /&gt; After two years of instruction and study, and under the watch of Halflants, the young 16 year old Reyes started his work as a teacher of children in the city of Baños, who still remember him for his introversion and kindness.&lt;ref name="perez-pimentel-encyclopedia-oscar-efren-reyes" /&gt;&lt;!-- This part seems promotional/unnecessary. It can be sourced to Pérez Pimentel's publication, but it would need to be reworded --&gt;

In 1914, with a scholarship from the State,&lt;ref name="perez-pimentel-encyclopedia-oscar-efren-reyes" /&gt; Reyes enrolled at the Juan Montalvo Normal&lt;!-- normal is a school for upcoming teachers --&gt;.&lt;ref name="aviles-pino-encyclopedia-oscar-efren-reyes" /&gt; He graduated in 1916 with the highest honors.&lt;ref name="la-hora-oscar-efren-reyes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="perez-pimentel-encyclopedia-oscar-efren-reyes" /&gt;

A '''paper money catalog''' or '''banknote catalog''' (or catalogue) is a catalog of [[banknotes]] and articles related to notable ones. The catalog is an essential tool of [[collecting]] as it provides information about the articles that many times cannot be extracted from them directly, such as the amount of banknotes printed.

In the 1950s, [[Robert Friedberg]] published the ''Paper Money of the United States''. Friedberg devised an organizing number system of all types of U.S. banknotes; the system is widely accepted among collectors and dealers to this day, and the volume has been regularly updated.

Another pioneer of cataloging banknotes was [[Albert Pick]], a well-known German [[notaphilist]] (born 15 May 1922 in Cologne) who published a number of catalogs of European paper money, and, in 1974, the first ''[[Standard Catalog of World Paper Money]]''. His collection of over 180,000 banknotes was eventually housed at the Bavarian Mortgages and Exchange Bank (Bayerischen Hypotheken- und Wechselbank, now [[HypoVereinsbank]]).  This catalog underwent several incarnations, and currently is published as a three volume group.  Volume I, called Specialized Issues, includes notes issued by local authorities, which circulated in a limited area.  Volume II called General Issues covers notes issued on a national scope, dated 1368 through 1960.  Volume III covers Modern Issues dated 1960 to present.  Each of the volumes is updated regularly, with Volume III now updated every year, Volumes I and II every 3 or so years.  While Pick no longer edits the catalogs (from 1994-2015 George S. Cuhaj was editor), the catalogs are still commonly referred to as 'Pick Catalogs' and dealers and collectors alike refer to banknotes by their 'Pick number.'
Current issues of the three volumes include: 
* Standard Catalog of World Paper Money:  Specialized Issues (11th Ed. Vol. 1) by George S. Cuhaj. Paperback - 1246 pages. (November 16, 2009).
* Standard Catalog of World Paper Money:  General Issues to 1368-1960 (14th Ed. Vol. 2) by George S. Cuhaj. Paperback - 1295 pages. (October 29, 2012).
* Standard Catalog of World Paper Money:  Modern Issues, 1961–present (21st Ed. Vol. 3) by George S. Cuhaj. Paperback - 1159 pages. (April, 2015).

Starting 2009, Colnect's banknote catalog has been launched, available only online and created by collectors. It currently lists over [http://colnect.com/en/banknotes/countries 58,227 banknotes] from 295 different locations.
  	
Starting 2011, [http://banknotenews.com BanknoteNews.com] began publishing [http://www.banknotebook.com ''The Banknote Book''], a catalog available as high-resolution full-color PDF files, as well as a 3-volume print edition published by Spink Books.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4664">'''Philostorgius''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Φιλοστόργιος}}; 368 &amp;ndash; c. 439 AD) was an [[Anomoeanism|Anomoean]] Church historian of the 4th and 5th centuries. Anomoeanism was an extreme form of [[Arianism]], denying the orthodox [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] account of the relationship between [[God the Father]] and [[Logos (Christianity)|Christ the Logos]] and arguing the two are of entirely different essences. This view was considered [[heretic|heretical]] by the [[Early Christianity|Church]], which adopted the term ''[[homoousion]]'', "coessential" or "consubstantial", to describe the relation between Father and Son in the [[Nicene Creed]] as a shared singular divinity.

Very little information about his life is available. He was born in Borissus, [[Cappadocia]] to Eulampia and Carterius,&lt;ref&gt;Philostorgius, in Photius, ''Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius'', book 9, chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and lived in [[Constantinople]] from the age of twenty. He is said to have come from an Arian family, and in Constantinople soon attached himself to [[Eunomius]], who receives a lot of praise from Philostorgius in his work.

He wrote a history of the [[Arian controversy]] titled ''Church History'' (Ἐκκλησιαστικὴ ἱστορία). Philostorgius' original appeared between 425 and 433, in other words, slightly earlier than the ''History'' of [[Socrates of Constantinople]], and was formed in twelve volumes bound in two books. The original is now lost. However, one copy was found by the ninth-century historian [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], in his library in Constantinople, who wrote an [[epitome]] of it. Others also borrowed from Philostorgius, most notably the author of the ''[[Artemii Passio]]'' ([[Artemius]] being a legendary martyr under [[Julian the Apostate]]), and so, despite the eventual disappearance of the original text, it is possible to form some idea of what it contained by reviewing the epitome and other references.&lt;ref&gt;Philostorgius [https://books.google.com/books?id=cz98HwAACAAJ&amp;dq=philostorgius+church+history ''Church History''], editor and translator Philip R. Amidon, S.J. (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2007), xxi&lt;/ref&gt; This reconstruction of what might have been in the text was first published, in German, by the Belgian philologist [[Joseph Bidez]] in 1913; a third, revised edition of his work undertaken by [[:de:Friedhelm_Winkelmann|Friedhelm Winkelmann]] was published in 1981; this edition has recently been translated into English by Philip R. Amidon.

He also wrote a treatise against [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], which is lost.&lt;ref&gt;Philostorgius, in Photius, ''Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius'', book 10, chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rawya Ateya'''{{Ref label|Name|I|}} ({{Lang-ar|راوية عطية}}, 19 April 1926 – 9 May 1997) was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] woman who became the first female [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarian]] in the [[Arab world]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"&gt;[[#Gol00|Goldschmidt 2000]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karam"&gt;[[#Kar98|Karam 1998]], p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rawya Ateya was born in [[Giza Governorate]] on 19 April 1926. She grew up in a politically active family. Her father was the secretary-general of the liberal [[Wafd Party]] in [[Gharbia Governorate|Gharbia]], and his political activities led to his incarceration.{{Citation needed|date= October 2012}} Ateya herself took part in demonstrations from a very early age, and she was injured during the 1939 anti-British protests.{{Citation needed|date= October 2012}} She continued her studies to an advanced level, which was highly unusual for Egyptian girls at the time.{{Citation needed|date= October 2012}} She obtained several university degrees in various fields: a ''[[License#Academy|license]]'' in letters from [[Cairo University]] in 1947, a diploma in education and psychology, a [[master's degree]] in journalism and a diploma in Islamic studies.{{Citation needed|date= October 2012}} She worked as a teacher for 15 years and had a brief six-month stint as a journalist.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt;

==Military service==
In 1956, Ateya became the first woman to be commissioned as an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the Liberation Army. She played an active role in the [[Suez War]], during which Egypt was invaded by the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Israel]]. She helped train 4,000 women in [[first aid]] and [[nursing]] amid the war.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt; Ateya held the rank of [[Captain (land)|captain]] in a women's [[commando]] unit.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;[[#Sul86|Sullivan 1986]], pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Yom Kippur War|October War]] of 1973, she chaired the Society of Families of Martyrs and Soldiers, which earned her the nickname of "mother of the martyred combatants."&lt;ref name="Magdi"&gt;{{Cite newspaper |last=Magdi |first=Ne'maat |date=25 August 2009|title=راوية عطية: أول نائبة مصرية بعد الثورة |trans-title=Rawya Ateya: the First Egyptian Female Deputy After the Revolution |newspaper=[[Al Rai (Kuwaiti newspaper)|Al Rai]] |series=The Parliament of Women |issue=11012 |page=7 |url=http://www.alraimedia.com/alrai/Article.aspx?id=152068 |language=Arabic |accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She obtained several military awards from the Egyptian state, notably the badge of the Third Army, the Medallion of 6 October and the medal of the armed forces.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt;

==Parliamentary career==
Voting rights and eligibility for elected office were extended to Egyptian women by President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] through the adoption of the [[Constitution of Egypt|1956 Constitution]]. The [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 1957|first elections]] under the new constitution were held the following year, on 3 July 1957. There were only 16 women in a field of more than 2,000 candidates. Opinion polls conducted at the time showed that 70% of Egyptian men were opposed to the idea of women taking seats in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=6 June 1957|title=Innovation for Egypt: Women Office Seekers Create Furor |journal=The Spartanburg Herald |volume=67 |issue=133 |page=8 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NjIsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z8sEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5865,748457 |accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Ateya overcame the odds and received 110,807 votes in her constituency.&lt;ref name="Magdi"/&gt; Elected from [[Cairo]] in the second round, she described the strong bias she faced at the time by saying: "I was met with resentment for being a woman. Yet I talked to them and reminded them of [[Muhammad's wives|the prophet's wives]] and families until they changed their opinions."{{Cite quote| date= October 2012}} In addition to such religious arguments, she used her military experience as a political asset.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt; Ateya's victory was all the more significant since her opponent in the election was pro-[[Communism|communist]] lawyer and banker Ahmed Fuad, a personal friend and [[Mentorship|protégé]] of President Nasser.&lt;ref name="Zevi"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Zevi |first=Tullia |date=30 January 1959|title=Gals Should Get More Than Equal Rights in Egypt |work=[[Pittsburgh Press|The Pittsburgh Press]] |volume=75 |issue=219 |page=13 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_AofAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=95UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7241,4072960 |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ateya took her seat in the [[Parliament of Egypt|National Assembly]] on 14 July 1957. Although another woman ([[Amina Shukri]]) was elected in the 1957 elections, her victory was only announced on 22 July, thus making Ateya the first female parliamentarian in Egypt and the whole [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name="Magdi"/&gt; During her time in Parliament, Ateya championed [[women's rights]]. She insisted on the implementation of [[Affirmative action|preferential treatment]] for female workers, notably a two-month [[Parental leave|maternity leave]] with full salary.{{Citation needed|date= October 2012}} In July 1958, she presented a law abolishing [[polygamy]].{{Citation needed|date= October 2012}} Although supported by most [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] from urban districts such as Cairo and [[Alexandria]], the law was strongly opposed by MPs representing rural districts and did not pass.{{Citation needed|date= October 2012}} Ateya was also unusually pro-American in an era of intense [[Arab nationalism]] and [[anti-imperialism]].{{Citation needed|date= October 2012}} After visiting the major communist and [[socialist-leaning countries]] of the time such as [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[India]], the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], she told reporters: "I have seen [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], but I really think that I would like Egypt to be more like the [[United States|United States of America]]."&lt;ref name="Zevi"/&gt; She publicly stated that she liked the [[United States]] and its president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], a position for which she was attacked. Nevertheless, she managed to get away with the criticism due to her strong support for President Nasser, whom she described as "beautiful".&lt;ref name="Zevi"/&gt;

Ateya's victory in 1957 was short-lived: two years later, she lost her bid for re-election. However, she remained active, notably serving on the board of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Crescent]].&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt; Twenty-five years after her electoral loss, Ateya managed to revive her parliamentary career. A [[Social democracy|social democrat]], she was elected to the [[People's Assembly of Egypt|People's Assembly]] in [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 1984|1984]] under the banner of the [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sul86|Sullivan 1986]], p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; She headed the Population and Family Council for Giza in 1993.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt;  Ateya died in 1997 at the age of 71.

==Legacy==
Rawya Ateya is considered a pioneering figure in the history of Egyptian and Arab feminism. In December 2007, a ceremony was held in the Egyptian Parliament to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Ateya's electoral victory.{{Citation needed|date= October 2012}} The ceremony was notably attended by [[Lateefa Al Gaood]] from [[Bahrain]], who had become a year earlier the first female [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] region, as well as [[Nada Haffadh]] also from [[Bahrain]] and that nation's first ever female cabinet minister.&lt;ref name="Women Gateway"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.womengateway.com/enwg/News/2007/December/egypt.htm |title=Bahraini joins Egypt’s women celebration |date=December 2007|publisher=Women Gateway |accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=May 2009}}

In the context of the [[skinhead]] [[subculture]], a '''redskin''' is a [[Marxism|marxist]] or [[Anarchism|anarchist]]  skinhead. The term combines the word ''red'', (a slang term for [[Socialism|socialist]] or [[Communism|communist]]) with the word ''skin'', which is short for skinhead. Redskins take a [[Militant (word)|militant]] [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] and pro-[[working class]] stance. 

The most well-known organization associated with redskins is [[Red and Anarchist Skinheads]] (RASH). Other groups that have had redskin members include [[Anti-Fascist Action]], [[Red Action]] and [[Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice]] (although SHARP does not have an official leftist ideology). Bands associated with redskins include: [[The Redskins]], [[Angelic Upstarts]], [[Blaggers I.T.A.]], [[Kortatu]], [[Skalariak]], [[Banda Bassotti]], [[The Burial]], [[Negu Gorriak]], [[Opció K-95]], [[Los Fastidios]], [[Kaos Urbano]],  [[Brigada Flores Magón]], [[Nucleo Terco]] and [[The Press (band)|The Press]]. One record label associated with the subculture is [[Insurgence Records]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1717">'''Ruaidhri Ó Cianáin''' (died 1387) was an Irish historian.

Described upon his death as "a learned historian without fault", "professor of [[Oirghialla]] in history", "chiefe Chronicler of the territory of Uriell". A member of the learned [[Ó Cianáin]] ([[Keenan (disambiguation)|Keenan]]) family, Ruaidhri was the scribe and compiler of ''Dunaire Mheig Shamhradháin'' (''Book of Maguran''), also known as ''Leabhar Meig Shamradhain.'' In the possession for many centuries of the Ó Conor Don family of Clonalis, Castlerea, [[County Roscommon]], but since 1972 [[National Library of Ireland]] MS G 1200.

A colophon in it reads ''Ruaidri O Cianan do sgrib in duanairsea do Thomas mac Brian meic Dondchaid meic Gille na Naem'' [Mag Shamradhain] ("Ruaidhri Ó Cianáin  who penned this poembook of Tomas son of Brian son of Donnchad son of Gilla na Naomh"). This Tomás was chief of Tulach Eachach ([[Tullyhaw]], [[County Cavan]], who died in 1343, so Ruaidhri was writing this ''dunaire'' in his lifetime. It is among the earliest post-Norman [[Irish language]] manuscripts of any kind to survive, though the compilers, including Ruaidhri, do not seem to have been trained poets.

'''Siddha medicine''' ({{indic|lang=ta|indic=சித்த மருத்துவம்|trans=citta maruttuvam}}) is a system of [[traditional medicine]] originating in ancient [[Tamilakam]] ([[Tamil Nadu]]) in South India and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;Recipes for Immortality : Healing, Religion, and Community in South India: Healing, Religion, and Community in South India, p.93, Wellington Richard S Weiss, Oxford University Press, 22-Jan-2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Ayurvedic Massage, John Douillard, p. 3, North Atlantic Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, it is taught that the [[siddhar]]s laid the foundation for this system of medication. Siddhars were spiritual adepts who possessed the ashta [[siddhi]]s, or the eight supernatural powers. [[Agastyar]] is considered the first siddha and the guru of all siddhars; the siddha system is believed to have been handed over to him by [[Murugan]], son of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]].&lt;ref name=un&gt;{{cite web | url=http://indianmedicine.nic.in/siddha.asp | title=Siddha |publisher=[[AYUSH|Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy]], Govt. of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy]] of the Government of India coordinates and promotes research in the fields of [[ayurveda]] and Siddha medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ccras.nic.in/About_CCRAS/20081011_AboutCCRAS.htm | title=About us |publisher=CCRAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Central Council of Indian Medicine]] (CCIM), a statutory body established in 1971 under [[AYUSH]], monitors higher education in areas of Indian medicine, including Siddha medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccimindia.org/index.html CCIM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226063741/http://ccimindia.org/index.html |date=26 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To fight [[bioprospecting]] and unethical patents, India set up the [[Traditional Knowledge Digital Library]] in 2001 as a repository of 223,000 formulations of various systems of medicine common in India, such as ayurveda, [[unani]], Siddha medicine and [[homeopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkdl.res.in/tkdl/langdefault/common/ Traditional Knowledge Digital Library] website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=61511|title=Know Instances of Patenting on the UES of Medicinal Plants in India|date=May 6, 2010|publisher=PIB, Ministry of Environment and Forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Siddha science is a traditional treatment system generated from Tamil culture. [[Palm leaf manuscript]]s say that the Siddha system was first described by Lord Shiva to his wife Parvati. Parvati explained all this knowledge to her son Lord Muruga. He taught all this knowledge to his disciple sage Agasthya. Agasthya taught 18 Siddhars and they spread this knowledge to human beings.&lt;ref name="Siddha - Origin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccras.nic.in/Siddha/20081011_OriginOfSiddha.htm |title=Siddha - Origin|author= |date= |work= |publisher=CCRAS, Department of AYUSH, Indian Government|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siddha is focused on "Ashtamahasiddhi," the eight supernatural power. Those who attained or achieved these powers are known as Siddhars. There were 18 important Siddhars in olden days and they developed this system of medicine. Hence, it is called Siddha medicine. The Siddhars wrote their knowledge in palm leaf manuscripts, fragments of which were found in parts of South India. It is believed that some families may possess more fragments but keep them solely for their own use. There is a huge collection of Siddha manuscripts kept by traditional Siddha families.&lt;ref name="Siddha - Origin"/&gt;

According to the manikandan, there were 22 principal [[siddhar]]s. Of these 22, [[Agasthya]] is believed to be the father of siddha medicine. Siddhars believed that a healthy [[soul]] can only be developed through a healthy body. So they developed methods and medication that are believed to strengthen their physical body and thereby their souls. Men and women who dedicated their lives into developing the system were called ''Siddhars''. They practised intense [[yogic]] practices, including years of periodic fasting and [[meditation]], and were believed to have achieved [[supernatural]] powers and gained the supreme wisdom and overall [[immortality]]. Through this spiritually attained supreme knowledge, they wrote scriptures on all aspects of life, from arts to science and truth of life to miracle cure for diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsir.gov.in/reports/ittp_tedo/ism/ISM_AS_Intro.pdf|title=Ayurveda &amp; Siddha|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Department of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research, Indian Government|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the manuscripts, the siddha system of medicine developed into part of Indian medical science. Today there are recognized siddha medical colleges, run under the government universities, where siddha medicine is taught{{cn|date=June 2015}}.

Most Siddha medical practitioners are traditionally trained, usually in families and by [[guru]]s (teachers). When the guru is a martial arts teacher, he is also known as an ''ashan''. They make a diagnosis after a patient's visit and set about to refer to their manuscripts for the appropriate remedies, which a true blue physician compounds by himself or herself, from thousands of herbal and herbo-mineral resources. The methodology of siddha thought has formulated curious remedies which may sometimes have more than 250 ingredients.

== World Siddha Day ==

After former Chief Minister Karunanidhi's announcement of Tamil New Year's Day as World Siddha Day, the first World Siddha Day was celebrated on 14 April 2009, addressed by his Excellency Shri Surjit Singh Barnala, Governor of Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Siddha Day|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/04/16/stories/2009041651490300.htm|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=16 April 2009|location=Erode, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second World Siddha Day was celebrated in a grand manner on 14 April 2010, at Image Auditorium, Adyar, [[Chennai]]; more than 2000 students, post graduates, practitioners and traditional vaidyas participated in the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Siddha Day to be observed on 14 April |url=http://www.newstodaynet.com/newsindex.php?id=21749%20&amp;%20section=7|accessdate=|newspaper=News Today|date=24 March 2010|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with the celebrations, a website was launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/worldsiddhaday/]&lt;/ref&gt; The third World Siddha day was celebrated at [[Trivandrum]], Kerala, where Siddha doctors met on 14 and 15 April 2011.

== Concept of disease and cause ==

It is assumed that when the normal equilibrium of the three humors — Vaadham, Pittham and Kapam — is disturbed, disease is caused. The factors assumed to affect this equilibrium are environment, climatic conditions, diet, physical activities, and stress. Under normal conditions, the ratio between Vaadham, Pittham, and Kapam are 4:2:1, respectively.&lt;ref name="siddha remedies"&gt;{{cite web|author=Master Murugan, Chillayah|publisher=[[Varma Kalai]] |title=Siddha Therapy, Natural Remedies and Self-Treatment|date=20 October 2012|url=http://www.silambam.asia|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Siddha medicine system, diet and lifestyle play a major role in health and in curing diseases. This concept of the Siddha medicine is termed as pathiyam and apathiyam, which is essentially a list of "do's and don'ts".

== Diagnosis ==

In diagnosis, examination of eight items is required which is commonly known as ''"enn vakaith thervu"''. These are:

# Na (tongue): black in Vaatham, yellow or red in pitham, white in kapam, ulcerated in [[anaemia]].
# Varnam (colour): dark in Vaatham, yellow or red in pitham, pale in kapam.
# Kural (voice): normal in Vaatham, high-pitched in pitham, low-pitched in kapam, slurred in [[alcoholism]].
# Kan (eyes): muddy conjunctiva, yellowish or red in pitham, pale in kapam.
# Thodal (touch): dry in Vaatham, warm in pitham, chill in kapam, sweating in different parts of the body.
# Malam (stool): black stools indicate Vaatham, yellow pitham, pale in kapam, dark red in ulcer and shiny in terminal illness.
# Neer (urine): early morning urine is examined; straw color indicates indigestion, reddish-yellow color in excessive heat, rose in blood pressure, saffron color in jaundice, and looks like meat washed water in renal disease.
# Naadi (pulse): the confirmatory method recorded on the radial artery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhp.gov.in/pulse-reading-in-siddha_mtl|title=Pulse Reading in Siddha {{!}} National Health Portal of India|website=www.nhp.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drugs ==

The drugs used by the Siddhars could be classified into three groups: ''thavaram'' (herbal product), ''thadhu'' (inorganic substances) and ''jangamam'' (animal products).&lt;ref name="siddha remedies"/&gt; The Thadhu drugs are further classified as: ''uppu'' (water-soluble inorganic substances or drugs that give out vapour when put into fire), ''pashanam'' (drugs not dissolved in water but emit vapour when fired), ''uparasam'' (similar to ''pashanam'' but differ in action), ''loham'' (not dissolved in water but melt when fired), ''rasam'' (drugs which are soft), and ''ghandhagam'' (drugs which are insoluble in water, like sulphur).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/1023/1/IJTK%206%284%29%20%282007%29%20678-686.pdf|title=Herbs used in Siddha medicine for arthritis - A review|author= |date=October 2007|work= |publisher=Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Siddha today ==

The Tamil Nadu state runs a 5.5-year course in Siddha medicine (BSMS:  Bachelor in Siddha Medicine and Surgery). The Indian Government also gives its focus on Siddha, by starting up medical colleges and research centers like National Institute of Siddha&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nischennai.org/| title=National Institute of Siddha | publisher=NIS, Chennai | accessdate=2010-12-25 | location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Central Council for Research in Siddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ccras.nic.in/| title=Central Council for Research in Ayurveda &amp; Siddha| publisher=CCRAS |accessdate=2010-12-25 | location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially, Siddha medicine is practiced by Siddha  referred in Tamil as ''vaithiyars''.

[[File:The Evolution of the Skirt (1916).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|''The Evolution of the skirt'', Harry Julius, 1916]]

A '''skirt''' is the lower part of a [[dress]] or [[gown]], covering the person from the waist downwards, or a separate outer [[garment]] serving this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | Skirt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hemline]] of skirts can vary from [[microskirt|micro]] to floor-length and can vary according to [[Culture|cultural]] conceptions of [[modesty]] and [[aesthetics]] as well as the wearer's personal taste, which can be [[Consumer behaviour|influenced]] by such factors as [[fashion]] and social context. Most skirts are self-standing garments, but some skirt-looking panels may be part of another garment such as [[leggings]], [[shorts]], and [[skirtini|swimsuits]].

In the [[western world]], skirts are more commonly worn by women; with some exceptions such as the [[izaar]] which is worn by [[Muslim]] cultures and the [[kilt]] which is a traditional [[man|men's]] garment in [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]] and sometimes [[England]]. Many fashion designers, such as [[Jean Paul Gaultier]], [[Vivienne Westwood]], [[Kenzo]] and [[Marc Jacobs]] have shown [[men's skirts]]. Transgressing social codes, Gaultier frequently introduces the skirt into his men's wear collections as a means of injecting novelty into male attire, most famously the sarong seen on [[David Beckham]].&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, Marnie (2011) ''The Fashion Design Directory''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. p.165,316&lt;/ref&gt; Other cultures traditionally wear skirts.

At its simplest, a skirt can be a [[draped garment]] made out of a single piece of fabric (such as [[pareo]]s), but most skirts are fitted to the body at the waist or hips and fuller below, with the fullness introduced by means of [[Dart (sewing)|darts]], gores, [[pleat]]s, or panels. Modern skirts are usually made of light to mid-weight [[textile|fabrics]], such as [[denim]], jersey, worsted, or poplin. Skirts of thin or clingy fabrics are often worn with [[Slip (clothing)|slips]] to make the material of the skirt drape better and for modesty.

== History ==
[[File:Fur skirt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Sumerian man wearing a [[kaunakes]] skirt, ca. 3.000 BC]]
[[File:Egyptian kilt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Statue of Ramaat, an official from Gizeh wearing a pleated Egyptian kilt, ca. 2.250 BC]]
[[File:BronzeAge01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Drawing of a girl's skirt made of wool yarn found in a [[Bronze Age]] tomb in Borum Eshøj (Danmark)]]
Skirts were worn since prehistoric times. They were the simplest way to cover the lower body. Pants were not at hand for a very long time. A straw-woven skirt dating to 3.900 BC was discovered in [[Armenia]] at the [[Areni-1 cave complex]].&lt;ref name=strawskirt&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.am/eng/news/73915.html | title = 5,900-year-old women’s skirt discovered in Armenian cave | first =  | last =  | work = News Armenia | date = September 13, 2011 | accessdate = September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skirts were the standard attire for men and women in all ancient cultures in the [[Near East]] and [[Egypt]]. The [[Sumer]]ians in [[Mesopotamia]] wore [[kaunakes]], a type of fur skirt tied to a belt. The term "kaunakes" originally referred to a sheep's fleece, but eventually came to be applied to the garment itself. Eventually, the animal pelts were replaced by kaunakes cloth, a textile that imitated fleecy sheep skin.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, Francois (1987): 20.000 Years of Fashion: The History of Costume and Personal Adornment. New York: Harry N. Abrams&lt;/ref&gt; Kaunakes cloth also served as a symbol in religious iconography, such as in the fleecy cloak of [[St. John the Baptist]].&lt;ref&gt;The Bible: Genesis 12:4-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, J.M. (1998): The Illustrated History of the World. Time-Life Books. Volume 1. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian garments were mainly made of linen. For the upper classes, they were beautifully woven and intricately pleated.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Elisabeth J.W. (1991): Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean. Princeton: Princeton University Press. p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2,130 BC, during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], men wore wraparound skirts (kilts) known as the [[shendyt]], They were made of a rectangular piece of cloth wrapped around the lower body and tied in front. By the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]], longer skirts, reaching from the waist to ankles and sometimes hanging from the armpits, became fashionable. During the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], kilts with a pleated triangular section became fashionable for men.&lt;ref&gt;Rief Anawalt, Patricia (2007): The Worldwide History of Dress. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Beneath these, a shente, or triangular loincloth whose ends were fastened with cord ties, were worn.&lt;ref&gt;Rief Anawalt, Patricia (2007): The Worldwide History of Dress. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Bronze Age]], in the Southern parts of Western and Central Europe, wraparound dress-like garments were preferred. However, in Northern Europe, people also wore skirts and blouses.&lt;ref&gt;Koch-Mertens, Wiebke (2000): Der Mensch und seine Kleider: Die Kulturgeschichte der Mode bis 1900. Artemis &amp; Winkler: Düsseldorf Zürich. pp. 49-51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], men and women preferred dress-like garments. The lower part of men′s dresses were much shorter in length compared to those for women. They were wide cut and often pleated or gored so that horse riding became more comfortable. Even a [[Knight|knight's]] armor had a short metal skirt below the breastplate. It covered the straps attaching the upper legs iron cuisse to the breastplate. Technological advances in weaving in the 13-15th century, like foot-treadle floor [[loom]]s and [[scissors]] with pivoted blades and handles, improved tailoring trousers and tights. They became fashionable for men and henceforth became standard male attire whilst becoming taboo for women.&lt;ref&gt;Tortora, Phyllis G. et. Al. (2014): Dictionary of Fashion. New York: Fairchild Books. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koch-Mertens, Wiebke (2000): Der Mensch und seine Kleider: Die Kulturgeschichte der Mode bis 1900. Artemis &amp; Winkler: Düsseldorf Zürich. pp. 156-162&lt;/ref&gt;

Skirts are still worn by men and women from many cultures, such as the [[lungi]], [[lehnga]], [[Kanga (African garment)|kanga]] and [[sarong]] worn in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[kilt]] worn in [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]].

One of the earliest known cultures to have females wear clothing resembling [[miniskirt]]s were the Duan Qun [[Miao people|Miao]] (短裙苗), which literally meant "short skirt Miao" in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. This was in reference to the short miniskirts "that barely cover the buttocks" worn by women of the tribe, and which were "probably shocking" to observers in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Encounters on China's Ethnic Frontiers|first=Stevan|last=Harrell|year=1995|publisher=[[University of Washington Press]]|isbn=0-295-97528-8|pages=98 &amp; 103|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, some upper-class women wore skirts over three metres in diameter at the bottom.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  At the other extreme, the [[miniskirt]]s of the 1960s were minimal garments that may have barely covered the underwear when seated. Costume historians{{Who|date=August 2011}} typically use the word "[[petticoat]]" to describe skirt-like garments of the 18th century or earlier.

=== 19th century ===

During the 19th century, the cut of women's [[dress]]es in western culture varied more widely than in any other century. [[waistline (clothing)|Waistlines]] started just below the bust (the [[Empire silhouette]]) and gradually sank to the natural waist. Skirts started fairly narrow and
increased dramatically to the [[hoopskirt]] and [[crinoline]]-supported styles of the 1860s; then fullness was draped and drawn to the back by means of [[bustle]]s.
In the 1890s the [[rainy daisy]] skirt was introduced for walking or sportswear. It had a significantly shorter hemline measuring as much as six inches off the ground and would eventually influence the wider introduction of shorter hemlines in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=hill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Daniel Delis|title=As seen in Vogue : a century of American fashion in advertising|date=2007|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|location=Lubbock, Tex. |isbn=978-0-89672-616-1 |pages=23–25|edition=1. pbk. print.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvilOZhaRkAC&amp;pg=PR35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
Beginning around 1915, [[hemline]]s for daytime dresses left the floor for good. For the next fifty years  fashionable skirts became short (1920s), then long (1930s), then shorter ([[World War II|the War Years]] with their restrictions on fabric), then long (the "[[Christian Dior SE#"New Look"|New Look]]"), then shortest of all from 1967 to 1970, when skirts became as short as possible while avoiding exposure of [[underwear]], which was considered [[taboo]]. However, a long skirt provided privacy when women needed to relieve themselves in the open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Gayle V.|title=Pantaloons &amp; Power: A Nineteenth-century Dress Reform in the United States, page 138|date=2001|publisher=Kent State University Press|location=Kent|isbn=9780873386821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s and the rise of [[Women wearing pants|pants/trousers for women]] as an option for all but the most formal of occasions, no one skirt length has dominated fashion for long, with short and ankle-length styles often appearing side-by-side in fashion magazines and catalogs.

Skirt is a part of [[school uniform|uniform]] for girls in many schools across the world, with length of skirt varying as per local culture. The [[pleat]]ed [[tartan]] skirt has been a component of girls' [[school uniform]]s since the early twentieth century in UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Ian|title=From Tartan to Tartanry: Scottish Culture, History and Myth, page 177|date=2010|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0748644490}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 21st century, skirt has become part of [[Western dress code]] for women and is worn as [[business casual]] and [[office wear]], and also as [[Sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] (ex. in [[tennis]]). Skirt may also be mandatory as [[formal wear]], such as for [[Flight attendant|airhostesses]], [[waitresses]], [[nurses]] and [[Women in the military|military women]].

{{Main|Men's skirts}}
[[File:Utilkilt beige.jpg|thumb|A man wearing an [[The Utilikilts Company|Utilikilt]], 2010]]
There are a number of garments marketed to men which fall under the category of "skirt" or "dress". These go by a variety of names and form part of the traditional dress for men from various cultures.  Usage varies – the [[dhoti]] is part of everyday dress on the Indian subcontinent while the kilt is more usually restricted to occasional wear and the [[fustanella]] is used almost exclusively as costume. Robes, which are a type of dress for men, have existed in many cultures, including the Japanese [[kimono]], the Chinese [[cheongsam]], the Arabic [[thobe]], and the African [[Senegalese kaftan]]. Robes are also used in some religious orders, such as the [[cassock]] in Christianity and various robes and cloaks that may be used in pagan rituals.  Examples of men's skirts and skirt-like garments from various cultures include:

* The [[fustanella]] is a full-pleated skirt worn by men in [[Greece]] and other parts of the Balkans. By the mid-20th Century, it was relegated to ceremonial use and as period or traditional costume. It is worn by the Evzones, or Evzoni (Greek: Εύζωνες, Εύζωνοι, pronounced [evˈzones, evˈzoni]), which is the name of several historical elite light infantry and mountain units of the [[Greek Army]]. Today, it refers to the members of the Presidential Guard who parade the [[presidential mansion]] wearing a short version of this historic costume. 
* The [[gho]] is a knee-length robe worn by men in [[Bhutan]]. They are required to wear it every day as part of national dress in government offices, in schools and on formal occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gho &amp; Kira: The National Dress |url=http://www.raonline.ch/pages/bt/visin2/bt_dress01.html|work=Bhutan's Culture |publisher=RAOnline|accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[hakama]] is worn in Japan. There are two types of hakama, divided umanori (馬乗り, "horse-riding hakama") and undivided andon hakama (行灯袴, "lantern hakama"). The umanori type has wide and divided legs, similar to [[culottes]]. Some hakamas are pleated.
* The [[kilt]] is a skirt of Gaelic and Celtic history, part of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] national dress in particular, and is worn formally and to a lesser extent informally.  Irish and Welsh kilts also exist but are not so much a part of national identity.
* The [[sarong]] is a piece of cloth that may be wrapped around the waist to form a skirt-like garment. Sarongs exist in various cultures under various names, including the [[pareo]] and [[lavalava]] of the Hawaiian islands and Polynesia (Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti, and Fiji), the Indian [[dhoti]] and [[lungi]], and the South Indian and Maldivian [[mundu]].

Aside from the wearing of [[kilt]]s, in the [[Western world]] skirts, dresses, and similar garments are generally viewed exclusively women's clothing which, historically, was not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History Of Men &amp; Skirts|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/the-history-of-men-skirts-58088|work=Bustle|date=22 May 2017|accessdate=5 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Western men have taken up skirts as forms of civil protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=These Men in Skirts and Dresses Protested Workplace Dress Codes.

[[File:Kazuivel II.jpg|thumb|Violet Latin stole and [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]].]]
The '''stole''' is a [[liturgy|liturgical]] [[vestment]] of various [[Christianity|Christian]] [[religious denomination|denominations]]. It consists of a band of colored cloth, formerly usually of [[silk]], about seven and a half to nine feet long and three to four inches wide, whose ends may be straight or may broaden out. The center of the stole is worn around the back of the neck and the two ends hang down parallel to each other in front, either attached to each other or hanging loose. The stole is almost always decorated in some way, usually with a cross or some other significant religious design. It is often decorated with contrasting galloons (ornamental [[trim (sewing)|trim]]) and [[Christianity and fringed garments|fringe]] is usually applied to the ends of the stole following {{bibleverse||Numbers|15:38-39|KJV}}. A piece of white linen or lace may be stitched onto the back of the collar as a sweat guard, which can be replaced more cheaply than the stole itself.

== Etymology and history ==
[[Image:Extreme Unction Rogier Van der Weyden.jpg|thumb|Priest administering [[Extreme Unction]] while wearing a narrow, gold stole (Detail of [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece|The Seven Sacraments]]'' [1445]).]]

The word ''stole'' derives via the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''stola'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] στολή (''stolē''), "garment", originally "array" or "equipment".

The stole was originally a kind of shawl that covered the shoulders and fell down in front of the body; on women they were often very large. After being adopted by the Church of Rome around the seventh century (the stole having also been adopted in other locales prior to this), the stole gradually became narrower and started to feature more ornate designs, developing into a mark of dignity. Nowadays, the stole is usually wider and can be made from a wide variety of material.

There are many theories as to the "ancestry" of the stole. Some say it came from the [[tallit]] (Jewish prayer mantle), because it is very similar to the present usage (as in the minister puts it on when he or she leads in prayer) but this theory is no longer regarded much today. More popular is the theory that the stole originated from a kind of liturgical napkin called an ''[[orarium]]'' (cf. [[orarion]]) very similar to the [[sudarium]]. In fact, in many places the stole is called the orarium. Therefore, it is linked to the napkin used by [[Jesus of Nazareth|Christ]] in washing the feet of his disciples, and is a fitting symbol of the yoke of Christ, the yoke of service.

The most likely origin for the stole, however, is to be connected with the scarf of office among Imperial officials in the [[Roman Empire]]. As members of the clergy became members of the Roman administration (see [[Constantine I and Christianity]]) they were granted certain honors, one specifically being a designator of rank within the imperial (and ecclesiastical) hierarchy. The various configurations of the stole (including the [[pallium]] or the [[omophorion]]) grew out of this usage. The original intent, then was to designate a person as belonging to a particular organization and to denote their rank within their group, a function which the stole continues to perform today. Thus, unlike other liturgical garments which were originally worn by every cleric or layman, the stole was a garment which was specifically restricted to particular classes of people based on occupation.

Stoles were already used in pre-Roman Italic religion. In the [[Umbrian]] [[Iguvine Tablets]], a stole was used by an officiating priest during offering rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bronzetablesofig00poul] James Wilson Poultney, ''The Bronze tables of Iguvium'' pg 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=gKQFAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=The+Bronze+tables+of+Iguvium&amp;q=stole&amp;redir_esc=y] ''The Bronze tables of Iguvium''&lt;/ref&gt; It was worn on the shoulder during a sacrifice, and then placed on an offering cake:

''While you are slaying it, wear a stole on your right shoulder. When you have slain it, place (the stole) upon the mefa cake. While you are presenting it, wear the stole on your right shoulder. Present grain-offerings and sacrifice with mead.'' (ibid, pg. 164)

== Symbolism and color ==
[[Image:Stolecolours.jpg|thumb|220px|Western stoles woven with a modern design in different [[liturgical colors]].]]

Together with the [[cincture]] and the now mostly defunct [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]], the stole symbolizes the bonds and fetters with which [[Jesus]] was bound during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]];&lt;ref&gt;''Deharbe's Large Catechism'' ([[RCL Benziger|Benziger Brothers]], 1921), [https://archive.org/stream/deharbeslargecat00deha#page/126/mode/2up p. 127]&lt;/ref&gt; it is usually ornamented with a cross. Another version is that the stole denotes [[Great Commission|the duty to spread the Word of God]].

A stole will generally be the [[liturgical color]] assigned by the church for the liturgical season or for the particular service.

== Use ==

=== Western Christianity ===
[[Image:BentoXVI-30-10052007.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] wearing an embroidered papal stole.]]

==== Roman Catholic ====
In the [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Catholic tradition]] the stole is the vestment that marks recipients of [[Holy Orders]]. It is conferred at the [[ordination]] of a [[deacon]], by which one becomes a member of the clergy after the suppression of the tonsure and [[minor orders]] after the [[Second Vatican Council]].

A [[bishop]] or other [[priest]] wears the stole around his neck with the ends hanging down in front, while the [[deacon]] places it over his left shoulder and ties it cross-wise at his right side, similar to a sash.

Before the reform of the liturgy after the Second Vatican Council, priests who were not bishops crossed the stole over the breast (as pictured below), but only at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or at other functions at which a [[chasuble]] or [[cope]] was worn. It is now worn hanging straight down (''General Instruction of the Roman Missal'', 340) at all times. On solemn occasions, the [[Pope]] wears, as part of his [[choir dress]], a special stole of state highly decorated and bearing his personal [[coat of arms]].

For the celebration of the Mass, the principal celebrant as well as concelebrants wear the stole over the [[alb]] but under the chasuble.  Likewise, the deacon wears the stole over the alb but under the dalmatic.  The stole is also worn over the [[surplice]] or alb for the distribution and reception of Holy Communion.

The priest or deacon who presides in paraliturgical celebrations, such as the Stations of the Cross, usually wears the stole over the surplice (or alb), and always under the cope.

==== Anglican ====
[[Image:Anglican priest vested in an alb, cincture and purple stole.jpg|thumb|100px|Stole crossed over the chest for a [[priest]].]]
[[Image:Stoledeacon.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Stole over the left shoulder for a [[deacon]].]]
During the [[English Reformation]], the stole, along with all other sacramental vestments were removed from the Church of England. The [[Oxford Movement]] began an interest in pre-Reformation worship, and eventually the stole (along with other vestments) were revived among [[Anglo-Catholic]] clergy. Though today, it is not uncommon for a [[Low Church]] priest to wear a stole with choir dress, stricter ones may still object to its use, and wear the [[tippet]] instead. This re-introduction of the stole continued to cause concern even in the 20th century. During the 1950s, the Bishop of London, [[William Wand]], and the Bishop of Oxford, [[Kenneth Kirk]] refused to ordain any candidate to the priesthood who would not wear a stole. Many candidates objected to wearing it because of their theological and traditional allegiances. Finally, [[Geoffrey Fisher]], Archbishop of Canterbury, had to resolve the matter, and instructed that all bishops must not refuse ordination simply because the candidate was unwilling to wear the stole.  Today, there is less controversy. When a stole is used in a deacon's ordination, it may be conferred on him or her and worn over the shoulder. At ordination to the [[priesthood]], the newly ordained priest then wears the stole around his or her neck, hanging down in front, either straight down or crossed across the front of the body and secured with the [[cincture]].

==== Protestant ====
In [[Protestant]] churches, the stole is most often seen as the symbol of ordination and the office of the ministry of [[Good news (Christianity)|Word]] and [[Sacrament]]. Stoles are often given by the congregation (sometimes hand-made or decorated) as a love gift at ordination or at other life milestones. Generally, Protestant clergy wear the stole in the same manner as Catholic priests—around the back of the neck with the ends hanging down the front (though not crossed). Stoles are commonly worn by ordained ministers in [[Lutheran]] (see below), [[Methodist]] (see below), [[Presbyterian]], [[United Church of Christ]], [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], and other denominations. The clergy of some other Protestant denominations will wear stoles, though normally those in the less liturgical churches will wear either a [[pulpit robe]] (with a [[preaching scarf]]) or simply a [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] during [[church service]]s.

===== Lutheran =====
In the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA), the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS), and the [[Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church]] ([[Germany]]), only [[pastor]]s wear the stole, as there is only the one order of ordination, that of pastor, in these Lutheran traditions. (The office of bishop for [[Episcopal polity]] and president for [[Congregationalist polity|Congregational Polity]] is not a separate order of ordination.) Diaconal ministers, the ELCA's equivalent to the deacon, generally do not wear the stole, but sometimes will wear the traditional deacon's stole while performing liturgical functions traditional to the diaconal order. However, in certain Lutheran Churches where people are ordained to the diaconal ministry, such as in the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], wearing a deacon's stole when assisting in a liturgy is an official rule. The Evangelical-Lutheran [[Church of Sweden]] clergy follow the use described for Anglican deacons and priests in this article, except the practice of wearing the stole hanging straight down is reserved for bishops (priests wear it crossed over the chest except over a surplice, when no cincture is worn).

===== Methodist =====
In the [[United Methodist Church]], ordained [[deacon]]s wear a stole around the shoulder as in the Anglican and Roman traditions. An ordained [[Elder (Methodism)|elder]] wears the stole in the same fashion as an Anglican or Roman Catholic priest, with the role of elder being the Methodist equivalent, among other Protestant denominations, to that office. The English word "priest" is in fact derived from the Greek word ''presbyter'', which means "elder".

=== Eastern Christianity ===
[[Image:Epitrachelion.jpg|thumb|Eastern Christian [[epitrachelion]].]]
[[Image:Orthodox Deacon.jpg|thumb|left|Greek Orthodox deacon wearing "doubled" [[orarion]].]]

==== Byzantine practice ====
In The Byzantine Rite practice of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Greek Catholic]] churches, the stole worn by a deacon is called an [[orarion]], while that worn by a priest or bishop is called an [[epitrachelion]] (a bishop additionally wears an [[omophorion]]), all similar in meaning and use to the Western stole.  In Greek Orthodox practice, the deacon wears a double orarion, meaning it comes over the left arm and under the right. Minor clerics (and in Greek and [[Melkite]] traditions the [[altar server]]s as well) wear an orarion wrapped around their waist, crossed in back, and then either crossed again in front and tucked under the belted section or not crossed and tucked in (see explanation of subdeacon below).

The [[priest]]'s epitrachelion consists of a long strip of cloth, hung around the neck with the two strips fastened together in front, either by buttons or by stitching. The epitrachelion comes down in front almost to the hem of his robes, and is symbolic of the priest's "anointing" ([[Septuagint]]: Psalm 132:2; [[KJV]]: [[Psalm 133|Psalm 133]]:2). Traditionally—though not necessarily—the epitrachelion will have seven crosses on it: six in the front (three on each side) and one on the back of the collar. The priest traditionally blesses the cross on the collar and kisses it before he puts it on, and kisses it again when he takes it off. When he is vesting for the [[Divine Liturgy]], he says the following prayer before putting on the epitrachelion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Blessed is God, Who poureth out His grace upon His priests, like the oil of [[myrrh]] upon the head, which runneth down upon the beard, upon the beard of [[Aaron]]: which runneth down to the fringe of his raiment.'' (Cf. Psalm 132:2, [[Septuagint|LXX]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Russian Orthodox]] tradition, the priest may say a special blessing and sprinkle the epitrachelion with [[holy water]] before it is worn for the first time. A priest is not permitted to celebrate even the simplest service, even the [[Daily Office]], unless he is wearing the epitrachelion (and in some traditions the [[epimanikia]], or "cuffs", as well). When a member of the faithful goes to [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], the priest places the edge of his epitrachelion over the head of the penitent as he confesses his sins. After the [[absolution]], the penitent will often kiss the priest's hand and then one of the crosses on the edge of the epitrachelion. At an Orthodox wedding, the priest will have the bridal couple hold the edge of his epitrachelion as he leads them in a procession three times around the [[Gospel Book]], symbolizing the [[pilgrimage]] of life.

The [[protodeacon]] or [[archdeacon]] wears the orarion "doubled", i.e., over the left shoulder, under the right arm, and passing again over the left shoulder. The two ends hang down, one in the front and one in the back, coming down almost to the hem of his [[sticharion]] (dalmatic).

A [[deacon]] wears an orarion which simply passes over the left shoulder, the two ends of which hang straight down, one in the front and one in the back, coming down almost to the hem of his sticharion. This is only common in the most traditional Orthodox churches. In many Eastern traditions, the stole is always worn "doubled" unless the deacon in question is wearing only his [[exorasson]] (outer cassock) and then it is essentially folded and worn over the left shoulder.

The [[subdeacon]] wears his orarion over both shoulders, crossed in the back and the front. Those acting as subdeacons (i.e., vested and serving as subdeacons but without having been ordained) wear their orarion crossed only in the back, to show that they do not bear [[holy orders]].

==== Oriental Orthodox ====
[[Image:Al Quds Patriarch.jpg|thumb|right|Bishops of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]. The wide oriental stole is clearly visible on the [[List of Armenian Patriarchs of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] (center, with [[crozier]] and [[pallium]]).]]

In the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the priestly stole is very similar to the epitrachelion described above; however, instead of a long narrow strip of fabric that is wrapped around the neck and fastened together, it is often cut out of a single broad piece of cloth that has a hole cut in it for the head to pass through. Sometimes, depending upon the liturgical Rite, it also extends farther down the back.

===British Monarch===
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Monarch]], although not in [[Holy Orders]], is [[Anointing|anointed]] with the oil of [[Chrism]] and invested with a stole during the [[Coronation of the British Monarch|Coronation rite]]. This stole, made of gold silk, is officially named the ''Stole Royal'' or ''Armilla'', and is one of several coronation robes kept overnight in the [[Jerusalem Chamber]] of [[Westminster Abbey]] before the day of the coronation.&lt;ref name="cox-sovereigns-robes"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cox, N.|year=1999|title=The Coronation Robes of the Sovereign|journal=Arma|volume=5|issue=1|pages=271–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coronation (which is always in the context of a [[Eucharist]]) is an official liturgy of the [[Church of England]]; the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] has responsibility for the ceremony and is almost always its presider.

=== Mandaean ===
A stole is used in the [[Mandaean]] religion by the priests during rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1kWzSxecUQC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=mandaean+stole&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9m3AFIcv6f&amp;sig=aFO_D2BVSimyJtxsDVihzPlUIt8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mandaean%20stole&amp;f=false] Kurt Rudolph, ''Mandaeism'' pg 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unitarian Universalist===
A stole/scarf/tippet is worn in the [[Unitarian Universalist]] religion by some ministers during weekly services. The garment is a symbol of ministry. UU stoles often are adorned with the Unitarian Universalist chalice and come in a wide range of colors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2198">'''Sukhothai''' ({{lang-th|สุโขทัย}}, {{IPA-th|sù.kʰǒː.tʰāj|pron}}) was the capital of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]]. Sukhothai is 12&amp;nbsp;km west of the modern city of [[Sukhothai Thani]].

==History==
Sukhothai is from Sanskrit ''sukha'' (सुख "happiness") + ''udaya'' (उदय "rise, emergence"), meaning "dawn of happiness". Founded in 1238, it is about 427&amp;nbsp;km north of Bangkok. Sukhothai was the capital of the Thai Empire for approximately 140 years. As of 2014, 193 temples have been excavated and partly reconstructed.

The [[Ram Khamhaeng Inscription|stele]] of [[Ram Khamhaeng]] states the city had a triple wall and four gates.  At its center was a pond, a "marvelous pond of clear and delicious water like the water of the [[Mekong]] in the dry season."  The Aranyika monastery was west of the city, a great lake to the east, a market to the north, and the Khao Luang hill to the south.&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|207}}

Old Sukhothai is a quiet town with almost no hotels. Most visitors stay in New Sukhothai. Others stay in the nearby city of Phitsanulok, which has numerous hotels and restaurants and is on the rail line between Bangkok and Chiang Mai.

Sukhothai occupies an area of 6,596&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The historic town of Sukhothai and related areas were designated a [[Sukhothai Historical Park|UNESCO World Heritage site]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/574 |title=Historic Town of Sukhothai and Associated Historic Towns - UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name and alias ==
Several news sources noted that the group's name was likely in reference to a character from the ''[[Mass Effect (series)|Mass Effect]]'' video game series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/234031-your-guide-to-the-shadow-brokers-nsa-theft-which-puts-the-snowden-leaks-to-shame|title=The 'Shadow Brokers' NSA theft puts the Snowden leaks to shame - ExtremeTech|date=19 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/shadow-brokers-nsa-equation-group-hack/|title=Shadow Brokers: Hackers Claim to have Breached NSA's Equation Group|date=15 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matt Suiche]] quoted the following description of that character: "The Shadow Broker is an individual at the head of an expansive organization which trades in information, always selling to the highest bidder. The Shadow Broker appears to be highly competent at its trade: all secrets that are bought and sold never allow one customer of the Broker to gain a significant advantage, forcing the customers to continue trading information to avoid becoming disadvantaged, allowing the Broker to remain in business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@msuiche/shadow-brokers-nsa-exploits-of-the-week-3f7e17bdc216|title=Shadow Brokers: NSA Exploits of the Week|date=15 August 2016|publisher=[[Medium.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leak history==
=== First leak: "Equation Group Cyber Weapons Auction - Invitation" ===
While the exact date is unclear, reports suggest that preparation of the [[Internet leak|leak]] started at least in the beginning of August,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2016/08/the-shadow-brokers-lifting-the-shadows-of-the-nsas-equation-group/|title=The Shadow Brokers: Lifting the Shadows of the NSA's Equation Group?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the initial publication occurred August 13, 2016 with a Tweet from a [[Twitter]] account "@shadowbrokerss" announcing a [[Pastebin.com|Pastebin]] page&lt;ref name="pastebin.com" /&gt; and a [[GitHub]] repository containing references and instructions for obtaining and decrypting the content of a file supposedly containing tools and exploits used by the [[Equation Group]].

====Publication and speculation about authenticity====
The Pastebin&lt;ref name="pastebin.com"/&gt; introduces a section titled "Equation Group Cyber Weapons Auction - Invitation", with the following content:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Equation Group Cyber Weapons Auction - Invitation

- ------------------------------------------------
 
!!! Attention government sponsors of cyber warfare and those who profit from it !!!!
 
How much you pay for enemies [[cyber weapon]]s? Not malware you find in networks. Both sides, [[remote access trojan|RAT]] + LP, full state sponsor tool set? We find cyber weapons made by creators of [[stuxnet]], [[duqu]], [[Flame (malware)|flame]]. [[Kaspersky Lab|Kaspersky]] calls Equation Group. We follow Equation Group traffic. We find Equation Group source range. We hack Equation Group. We find many many Equation Group cyber weapons. You see pictures. We give you some Equation Group files free, you see. This is good proof no? You enjoy!!! You break many things. You find many intrusions. You write many words. But not all, we are auction the best files.
. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Pastebin includes various references for obtaining the file, named "EQGRP-Auction-Files.zip". This [[Zip (file format)|zip file]] contains seven files, two of which are the [[GNU Privacy Guard|GPG]]-encrypted archives "eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg" and "eqgrp-free-file.tar.xz.gpg". The "eqgrp-free-file.tar.xz.gpg" archive's password was revealed in the original Pastebin to be &lt;code&gt;theequationgroup&lt;/code&gt;. The "eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz" archive's password was revealed in a later Medium post to be &lt;code&gt;CrDj"(;Va.*NdlnzB9M?@K2)#&gt;deB7mN&lt;/code&gt;.

The Pastebin continues with instructions for obtaining the password to the encrypted [[Online auction|auction]] file:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Auction Instructions

- --------------------

We auction best files to highest bidder. Auction files better than stuxnet. Auction files better than free files we already give you. The party which sends most bitcoins to address: 19BY2XCgbDe6WtTVbTyzM9eR3LYr6VitWK before bidding stops is winner, we tell how to decrypt. Very important!!! When you send bitcoin you add additional output to transaction. You add OP_Return output. In Op_Return output you put your (bidder) contact info. We suggest use bitmessage or I2P-bote email address. No other information will be disclosed by us publicly. Do not believe unsigned messages. We will contact winner with decryption instructions. Winner can do with files as they please, we not release files to public.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The initial response to the publication was met with some skepticism,&lt;ref name="businessinsider_2016_NSA_TSB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/shadow-brokers-claims-to-hack-equation-group-group-linked-to-nsa-2016-8?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T|title='Shadow Brokers' claim to have hacked an NSA-linked elite computer security unit |author=Rob Price |publisher=''[[Business Insider]]'' |date=August 15, 2016 |access-date=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as to whether or not the content actually would be "...many many Equation Group cyber weapons."&lt;ref name="pastebin.com"/&gt;

=== Second leak: "Message #5 - TrickOrTreat"  ===
This publication, made on October 31, 2016,  contains a list of servers, supposedly compromised by Equation Group as well as references to seven supposedly undisclosed tools (DEWDROP, INCISION, JACKLADDER, ORANGUTAN, PATCHICILLIN, RETICULUM, SIDETRACK AND STOCSURGEON) also used by the threat actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortunascorner.com/2016/11/01/shadow-brokers-reveal-list-of-servers-hacked-by-the-nsa-china-japan-and-korea-the-top-3-targeted-countries-49-total-countries-including-china-japan-germany-korea-india-italy-mexico-sp/|title='Shadow Brokers' Reveal List Of Servers Hacked By The NSA; China, Japan, And Korea The Top 3 Targeted Countries; 49 Total Countries, Including: China, Japan, Germany, Korea, India, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Taiwan, &amp; Russia|date=2016-11-01|website=Fortuna's Corner|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third leak: "Message #6 - BLACK FRIDAY / CYBER MONDAY SALE" ===
Message #6 reads as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;TheShadowBrokers is trying auction. Peoples no like. TheShadowBrokers is trying crowdfunding. Peoples is no liking. Now TheShadowBrokers is trying direct sales. Be checking out ListOfWarez. If you like, you email TheShadowBrokers with name of Warez you want make purchase. TheShadowBrokers is emailing you back bitcoin address. You make payment. TheShadowBrokers emailing you link + decryption password.

Files as always being signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bit.no.com:43110/theshadowbrokers.bit/post/message6/|title=MESSAGE #6 - BLACK FRIDAY / CYBER MONDAY SALE|last=|first=|date=|website=bit.no.com|publisher=bit.no.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This leak&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bit.no.com:43110/theshadowbrokers.bit/files/unix_screenshots.zip|title=unix_screenshots.zip|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=bit.no.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains 60 folders named in a way to serve as reference to tools likely used by Equation Group. The leak doesn't contain executable files, but rather screenshots of the tools file structure. While the leak could be a fake, the overall cohesion between previous and future leaks and references as well as the work required to fake such a fabrication, gives credibility to the theory that the referenced tools are genuine.

=== Fourth leak: "Don't Forget Your Base" ===
On April 8, 2017, the [[Medium (website)|Medium]] account used by The Shadow Brokers posted a new update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=theshadowbrokers|title=Don't Forget Your Base|url=https://medium.com/@shadowbrokerss/dont-forget-your-base-867d304a94b1|publisher=Medium|accessdate=April 9, 2017|date=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post revealed the password to encrypted files released last year to be &lt;code&gt;CrDj"(;Va.*NdlnzB9M?@K2)#&gt;deB7mN&lt;/code&gt;. Those files allegedly reveal more NSA hacking tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Joseph|title=They're Back: The Shadow Brokers Release More Alleged Exploits|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/theyre-back-the-shadow-brokers-release-more-alleged-exploits|website=Motherboard|publisher=Vice Motherboard|accessdate=April 8, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; This posting explicitly stated that the post was partially in response to President Trump's [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|attack against a Syrian airfield]], which was also used by Russian forces.

The decrypted file, eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz, contained a collection of tools primarily for compromising Linux/Unix based environments.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/x0rz/EQGRP&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fifth leak: "Lost in Translation" ===
On April 14, 2017, the [[Twitter]] account used by The Shadow Brokers posted a tweet with a link&lt;ref name="steemit_TSB"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://steemit.com/shadowbrokers/@theshadowbrokers/lost-in-translation |work=Steemit |title=Lost in Translation |date=April 14, 2017 |accessdate=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Steem blockchain. Herein, a message with a link to the leak files, encrypted with the password &lt;code&gt;Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee&lt;/code&gt;.

Martin III]], a former contractor for [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] accused of stealing approximately 50 terabytes of data from the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), was the lead suspect. The Shadow Brokers continued posting messages that were cryptographically-signed and were interviewed by media while Martin was detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Joseph|title=NSA Exploit Peddlers The Shadow Brokers Call It Quits|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/nsa-exploit-peddlers-the-shadow-brokers-call-it-quits|work=Motherboard|date=January 12, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory on ties to Russia===
[[Edward Snowden]] stated on [[Twitter]] on August 16, 2016 that "circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility"&lt;ref name="twitter_Snowden_2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765514891813945344 |title=Circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility.

''[[The New York Times]]'' put the incident in the context of the [[Democratic National Committee cyber attacks]] and hacking of the [[Podesta emails]]. As US intelligence agencies were contemplating counter-attacks, the Shadow Brokers code release was to be seen as a warning: "Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in ''[[The Godfather]]'' where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed, as a warning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=December 13, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html |authors=Eric Lipton, David E.

==Life and work==
Thomas James DiLorenzo grew up in western [[Pennsylvania]], descended from Italian immigrants. In an  autobiographical essay he attributes his early commitment to individualism to "playing competitive sports." His view of politicians in the small western cities of the state was that they were in it for personal aggrandizement.&lt;ref name=evil/&gt; He thought his family and neighbors worked hard and perceived other people getting advantages from the government. As a youth in the 1960s, he began to think that the "government was busy destroying the work ethic, the family, and the criminal justice system."&lt;ref name=evil/&gt; Although too young to worry about the Vietnam War draft, he concluded that other young men turned themselves inside out to avoid it, or came back silenced by what they had done and seen. These conclusions led him to the opinion that politics were "evil".&lt;ref name=evil&gt;DiLorenzo, Thomas, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/2002/12/thomas-dilorenzo/the-evil-of-politics/ "The Evil of Politics"], [[LewRockwell.com]], 25 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

DiLorenzo began to study [[libertarianism]] in college, which he says helped him gain perspective on his developing ideas.&lt;ref name=evil/&gt; He has a B.A. in economics from [[Westminster College (Pennsylvania)|Westminster College]] in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Wile"&gt;[https://archive.is/20131204180844/http://www.thedailybell.com/exclusive-interviews/1053/Thomas-DiLorenzo-Abraham-Lincoln-US-Authoritarianism-Free-Market-History/ Anthony Wile, "Interview with Thomas James DiLorenzo on Abraham Lincoln, U.S. Authoritarianism and Manipulated History"], ''The Daily Bell,'' 16 May 2010, published by High Alert Capital Partners.&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a [[Ph.D.]] in Economics from [[Virginia Tech]].&lt;ref name=loyola/&gt;

DiLorenzo is a frequent speaker at [[von Mises Institute]] events, and offers several online courses on political subjects on the Mises Academy platform.&lt;ref name = "mises" /&gt; He also writes for the blog, [[LewRockwell.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo-arch.html Archive of DiLorenzo commentary] for [[LewRockwell.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
DiLorenzo writes about what he calls "the myth of Lincoln" in American history and politics. He has said, "[President] Lincoln is on record time after time rejecting the idea of racial equality. But whenever anyone brings this up, the Lincoln partisans go to the extreme to smear the bearer of bad news."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas DiLorenzo, [https://mises.org/daily/973 "Confronting the Lincoln Cult,"], ''Mises Daily'', 3 June 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abraham Lincoln Online: Speeches and Writing|title=Letter to Henry L. Pierce and others|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/pierce.htm|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiLorenzo has also spoken out in favor of the secession of the [[Confederate States of America]], defending the right of these states to secede.&lt;ref name=Abolitionist&gt;Thomas DiLorenzo, [https://www.lewrockwell.com/2004/10/thomas-dilorenzo/abolitionist-defends-the-south/ "An Abolitionist Defends the South,"], LewRockwell.com, October 20, 2004].&lt;/ref&gt;

DiLorenzo is critical of [[neoconservatism]] and endless [[military interventionism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lewrockwell.com/2013/06/thomas-dilorenzo/neocons-are-unhinged/&lt;/ref&gt; He has also made the case about how the military does not protect the U.S. and how it lies about it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lewrockwell.com/2007/09/thomas-dilorenzo/why-the-military-fails-to-protect-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
DiLorenzo's book, ''[[The Real Lincoln|The Real Lincoln: A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an Unnecessary War]]'' is a critical biography published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas DiLorenzo, ''The Real Lincoln: A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an Unnecessary War'', Random House LLC, 2002, {{ISBN|9780307559388}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review published by the Ludwig von Mises Institute, [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] described DiLorenzo's thesis: Lincoln was a "white supremacist" with no principled interest in abolishing slavery, and believed in a strong central government that imposed high tariffs and a nationalized banking system. He attributes the South's secession to Lincoln's economic policies rather than a desire to preserve slavery. Gordon quotes DiLorenzo: "slavery was already in sharp decline in the border states and the upper South generally, mostly for economic reasons".&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] review of Thomas J. DiLorenzo, [https://mises.org/misesreview_detail.aspx?control=207 "The Real Lincoln: A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an Unnecessary War"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914004104/https://mises.org/misesreview_detail.aspx?control=207 |date=2014-09-14 }}, ''The Mises Review'',  Vol. 8, No. 2, February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; While this was true, in the Deep South slavery was profitable and an integral part of both the agricultural and industrial economy, as slaves worked in factories, in shipping, as artisans and skilled workers, in addition to field labor. The slave markets and associated businesses had made New Orleans the 4th-largest city in the nation and the wealthiest by 1840{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.

Writing for ''The Daily Beast'', [[Rich Lowry]] described DiLorenzo's technique in this book as the following: "His scholarship, such as it is, consists of rummaging through the record for anything he can find to damn Lincoln, stripping it of any nuance or context, and piling on pejorative adjectives. In DiLorenzo, the Lincoln-haters have found a champion with the judiciousness and the temperament they deserve."&lt;ref name="lowry"&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/17/the-rancid-abraham-lincoln-haters-of-the-libertarian-right.html "The Rancid Abraham Lincoln-Haters of the Libertarian Right"], ''The Daily Beast'', 17 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing for ''[[The Independent Institute|The Independent Review]]'', a think tank associated with DiLorenzo, [[Richard M. Gamble]] described the book "travesty of [[historical method]] and documentation". He said the book was plagued by a "labyrinth of [historical and grammatical] errors", and concluded that DiLorenzo has "earned the ... ridicule of his critics."&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Richard M. "The Real Lincoln: Book review" ''The Independent Review'' [http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=79].&lt;/ref&gt;  In his review for the [[Claremont Institute]], Ken Masugi writes that "DiLorenzo adopts as his own the fundamental mistake of leftist multi-culturalist historians: confusing the issue of race with the much more fundamental one, which was slavery." He noted that in Illinois "the anti-slavery forces actually joined with racists to keep their state free of slavery, and also free of blacks." Masugi called DiLorenzo's work "shabby" and stated that DiLorenzo's treatment of Lincoln was "feckless" and that the book is "truly awful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masugi|first=Ken|title=The Unreal Lincoln|url=http://www.claremont.org/publications/pubid.226/pub_detail.asp|publisher=Claremont Institute|accessdate=26 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203053713/http://www.claremont.org/publications/pubid.226/pub_detail.asp|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Masugi]] is an academic in the fields of American history and multiculturalism at Johns Hopkins University and the Claremont Institute.

Jaffa#Debate with Thomas DiLorenzo|Harry V. Jaffa]] on the merits of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s statesmanship before and during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Real Abraham Lincoln: A Debate|url=http://www.independent.org/events/transcript.asp?eventID=9|work=Events|publisher=The [[Independent Institute]]|author=[[Harry V.

DiLorenzo's book, ''[[Lincoln Unmasked|Lincoln Unmasked: What You're Not Supposed to Know About Dishonest Abe]]'' (2007), continues his explorations begun in ''The Real Lincoln.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas DiLorenzo, ''Lincoln Unmasked: What You're Not Supposed to Know About Dishonest Abe'', Random House LLC, 2007, {{ISBN|030749652X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review, David Gordon stated that DiLorenzo's thesis in the 2007 volume was that Lincoln opposed the extension of slavery to new states because black labor would compete with white labor; that Lincoln hoped that  all blacks would eventually be deported to Africa in order that white laborers could have more work. According to Gordon, DiLorenzo states that Lincoln supported emancipation of slaves only as a wartime expedient to help defeat the South.&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon review of ''Lincoln Unmasked: What You're Not Supposed to Know About Dishonest Abe'', ''Mises Review'', Vol. 13, No. 2, February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' both stated that the book seemed directed at unnamed scholars who had praised Lincoln's contributions. Justin Ewers criticized DiLorenzo, saying this book "is more of a diatribe against a mostly unnamed group of Lincoln scholars than a real historical analysis. His wild assertions – for example, that Lincoln held 'lifelong white supremacist views' – don't help his argument."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/12/AR2007011200119_2.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Justin | last=Ewers | title=Memorializing Lincoln | date=January 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'' described this as a "screed," in which DiLorenzo "charges that most scholars of the Civil War are part of a 'Lincoln cult';" he particularly attacks scholar [[Eric Foner]], characterizing him and other as "cover-up artists" and "propagandists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-307-33841-9 |title=Nonfiction Book Review: Lincoln Unmasked: What You're Not Supposed to Know About Dishonest Abe by Thomas J.

In a 2009 review of three newly published books on Lincoln, historian Brian Dirck linked the earlier work of Thomas DiLorenzo with that of [[Lerone Bennett]], another critic of Lincoln. He wrote that "Few Civil War scholars take Bennett and DiLorenzo seriously, pointing to their narrow political agenda and faulty research."&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cwh/summary/v055/55.3.dirck.html Dirck, Brian.

==Controversy over League of the South involvement==
Controversy arose in 2011 when DiLorenzo testified before the [[House Financial Services Committee]] at the request of former U.S. Congressman [[Ron Paul]]. During the hearing, Congressman [[Lacy Clay]] criticized DiLorenzo for his associations with the [[League of the South]], which Clay described as a "[[neo-Confederate]] group".&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, Childs (February 11, 2011).

''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Reuters]]'' and ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' articles about the hearing, a [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] story about DiLorenzo's connection with the League was mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Andy (February 9, 2011).

DiLorenzo denied any affiliation with the group, telling a ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' reporter that "I don't endorse what they say and do any more than I endorse what Congress says and does because I spoke at a hearing on Wednesday."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} An investigation was subsequently conducted by his employer.&lt;ref name=Burris&gt;Burris, Joe (February 14, 2011).

'''Walter Batchelor MacDougall''' (6 April 1907 – 5 May 1976) was an Australian missionary and [[Park ranger|patrol officer]] who worked with the [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous peoples]] in the desert regions of [[Western Australia]] and [[South Australia]]

==Biography==
MacDougall was born in [[Mornington, Victoria|Mornington]], the fifth son of a Scottish [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian minister]]. After some years in Tasmania, his family returned to Melbourne where he matriculated from [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]] in 1922. For eight years (1931–1939) he served as an assistant minister at the Presbyterian mission at [[Mowanjum Community|Port George IV (Kunmunya)]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley region]] of Western Australia.{{sfn|Edwards|2000}} In 1940 he took up an appointment at the [[Pukatja, South Australia|Ernabella mission]] in the north western corner of South Australia, and picked up a working knowledge of [[Pitjantjatjara dialect|Pitjantjatjara]].{{sfn|Edwards|2000}} Despite a physical disability from a bullet wound to his hand, which resulted in his losing a thumb and finger, he managed to be enlisted in the [[Australian Army|army]] and worked in a transport division in northern Australia until his discharge in 1944.{{sfn|Edwards|2000}}

In 1947 he was hired to work, on the basis of his extensive experience with aboriginal communities, as a patrol officer attached to the [[Woomera Test Range]]. As Britain began to undertake weapons testing and experiments on the atomic bomb at [[Emu Field, South Australia|Emu Field]] and [[Maralinga]], MacDougall was delegated to shift people out of the affected area down to the [[Yalata, South Australia|Yalata]].{{sfn|Edwards|2000}} In 1956 he was promoted to the position of [[Protector of Aborigines|Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia]] and by that time was responsible for patrolling some 400,000 sq. miles of desert terrain, together with a new officer, Robert Macauley, with whom he had personal differences.

MacDougall was of the opinion that the aboriginal population should be gradually assimilated into the mainstream. He went on record as stating that:&lt;blockquote&gt;'We have taken away their  beliefs and customs and trespassed on their lands, and we have a moral obligation to give them something in return'.{{sfn|Edwards|2000}}{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=151–153}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; At the same time, he found himself at odds with officials overseeing areas where military installations were planned and armament experiments conducted. MacDougall surveyed specific localities containing ceremonial zones and sacred sites to inform the government authorities to avoid intruding there to avoid giving offense.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=151–153}} He was strongly opposed to the establishment of the [[Giles Weather Station]] in the [[Rawlinson Ranges]] since it lay on tribal land.{{sfn|Lindell|Bennett|2001|p=201|ps='''{{red| ?}}'''}} The authorities feared him for his forthright criticism based on a deep knowledge of the indigenous societies. He threatened to go to the newspapers on one occasion and was warned not to meddle with political or policy issues.{{sfn|Cross|2003|p=83}}

MacDougall retired after 25&amp;nbsp;years of service and died of a combination of pneumonia and [[pericarditis]] at [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] in 1976.{{sfn|Edwards|2000}} His biographer W.H. Edwards cites as a suitable, complimentary epitaph for MacDougall was a hostile put-down made by a scientist involved in the atomic arms testing. MacDougall had placed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'the affairs of a handful of natives above those of the British Commonwealth of Nations'.{{sfn|Edwards|2000}}{{sfn|Cross|2003|p=83}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
