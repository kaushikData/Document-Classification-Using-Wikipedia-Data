The '''meridian 1° east of [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich]]''' is a line of [[longitude]] that extends from the [[North Pole]] across the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], the [[Southern Ocean]], and [[Antarctica]] to the [[South Pole]].

The 1st meridian east forms a [[great circle]] with the [[179th meridian west]].

==From Pole to Pole==
Starting at the [[North Pole]] and heading south to the [[South Pole]], the 1st meridian east passes through:

'''Alfred Jahn''' (April 22, 1915, [[Kleparów]], near [[Lwów]] (L'viv) &amp;ndash; April 1, 1999, [[Wrocław]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[geographer]], [[geomorphologist]], [[polar explorer]] and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of [[Wrocław University]].

==Biography==
He was born on April 22, 1915 in [[Kleparów]], near [[Lwów]] (L'viv). He obtained a Masters of Science degree at the [[Jan Kazimierz University]] in Lwów in 1937. In the same year he took part in the [[First Polish West Greenland Expedition]], organized by [[Aleksander Kosiba]], which provided him with enough material for his PhD dissertation. Completed in 1939, it had the title "Investigations on the structure and temperature of soils in West Greenland".&lt;ref name="birk"/&gt;

Jahn survived the [[Nazi occupation of Poland]] by working as a [[feeder of lice]] at [[Rudolf Weigl]]'s typhus research institute in Lwów. After the war he first worked in [[Lublin]], at the [[Maria Curie-Skłodowska University]], and then in the reconstituted Wrocław University (which included a large number of the faculty from Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów who survived the war). In the 1950s he resumed his polar studies, participating in expeditions to [[Spitsbergen]] and the [[Polish Polar Station, Hornsund|Polish Polar Station in Hornsund]]. He also conducted research in [[Siberia]], [[Alaska]] and other parts of [[Scandinavia]] which made him one of the foremost polar geomorphologists in the world. He was made president (rector) of Wrocław University in 1962.&lt;ref name="birk"/&gt; In 1953 and 1980 Alfred Jahn published various works on the Polish part of the [[Sudetes|Sudetes Mountains]] emphasizing the [[Climatic geomorphology|role of climate]] in shaping the mountains.&lt;ref name=RozyMig2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Różycka |first1=Milena |last2=Migoń |first2=Piotr|author-link2=Piotr Migoń |date=2017 |title=Tectonic geomorphology of the Sudetes Mountains (Central Europe) — A review and re-apprisal |journal=Annales Societatis Geologorum Poloniae |volume=87 |issue= |pages=275–300 |doi=10.14241/asgp.2017.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, as a rector of Wrocław University, he made the decision to support the [[1968 Polish political crisis#Polish student and intellectual protest|student strikes]] against Communist censorship. As a result, he lost his job.&lt;ref name="birk"/&gt; Likewise, during the [[martial law in Poland]] in 1982, he spoke out against the policies of the [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]] government and was consequently removed by the authorities from his position as chair of the Committee on Polar Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name="polar"/&gt;

In 1972 he founded the [[Polar Club of the Geographical Society of Poland]] and served as its first president until 1982.&lt;ref name="birk"/&gt; Jahn retired in the 1990s but remained scholarly active until his death on April 1, 1999 in [[Wrocław]].&lt;ref name="migon"/&gt;

Alfred Jahn was a member of the [[Polish Academy of Science]], of [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]], and the German [[Akademie Leopoldina]].&lt;ref name="birk"/&gt; He published his memoirs, "Z Kleparowa w świat szeroki" (''From Kleparow into the big wide world''), in 1991.&lt;ref name="zkleparowa"/&gt;

An '''alternative universe''' (also known as '''AU''', '''alternative timeline''', '''alternate timeline''', '''alternative reality''', or '''alternate reality''') is the occurrence of [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] facts about the setting or characterization of a particular [[fictional universe]] being explored in a non-canonical way. These universes are often made unofficially, though elements of [[fan fiction]] are sometimes used in official, though usually non-canonical, storylines.

Stories that fall into this definition are usually "what-ifs", where possibilities arising from circumstances that do not occur in the original [[fictional universe]] are explored. For example, the premise of an alternative universe story may go something like this: "What would happen if character X was killed before event Y could happen?" Unlike regular fan fiction, which generally remains within the boundaries of the canon set out by the author, alternative universe fiction writers like to explore the possibilities of pivotal changes made to characters' history, motivations, or environment, often combining material from multiple sources for inspiration.

==Types of AU fiction==
Authors and readers of AU fanfiction enjoy it for many different reasons, but there are several shared story types that exist within many [[fandom]]s: alternative timelines, contextual reassignment, "reality" swaps, crossovers, and predictive fiction.

===Alternative timelines===
Stories with alternative timelines follow the established canon before veering away at a crucial moment—similar in concept to many entries in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' series and [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Elseworlds]]'' series. The Pokémon TV and video game series too has had its fair share of alternative universe fanfictions. One example notable{{By whom|date=October 2017}} for its popularity is "Blue Tears", a story in which the pokémon trainer Blue gets revenge on his rival Red after Red's actions on the ''S.S. Anne'' led to the death of Blue's [[List of Pokémon (1-51)#Raticate|Raticate]].

Some alternative timeline stories are called '''"fix-it fics"''' because they rewrite the story so that the consequences of events are undone, although beginning events are the same.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} An example from the [[Harry Potter universe]] is "Extenuating Circumstances" by SarahtheBardess, in which Harry's godfather Sirius Black still dies at the hands of his cousin Bellatrix LeStrange but is returned to life. Others are called '''"denial-fics"''' because they ignore certain pivotal events in a given canon.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} An example of this type, also from the Harry Potter universe, is "You Don't Belong Here" by Hieirulesall. The author notes that they want Sirius Black to live but do not want to resort to bringing him back from the dead.

In the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' fanfic "A Dark, Distorted Mirror" by Gareth Williams, the [[Minbari|alien]] ambassador [[Delenn]] chooses a different pilot—not [[Jeffrey Sinclair]], a crucial contributor to both the battle and fictional universe as a whole—to bring aboard a [[Minbari Cruiser|Minbari warship]] during the [[Battle of the Line|final battle]] in the war between the Minbari and Earth. As a result, the [[Minbari Federation|Minbari]] do not find out about an important connection between themselves and humans, do not surrender, and successfully destroy the planet Earth and continue the war. However, despite the dark and desperate struggle that ensues as a result, the eventual outcome offers hope for a better future.

Another example of a subgenre of the alternative timeline story is called a '''"do-over fic",''' similar to "fix-it fics" in which consequences of an event are undone, but in do-over fics particularly the entire story is reset to the beginning, and the author creates an alternate timeline that diverges from the original canon of the work. "What is Right: Year One" by Emma Lipardi is a do-over fic surrounding the idea of a Hogwarts student having the ability to "Re-do" their life from the start.

===Plot switch===
Plot switch stories take the characters from a series and place them in another time, place, or situation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} An example is "Welcome to Hogwarts" by AD Miller, a [[Glee (TV series)|Glee]] story that transfers Glee characters to [[Hogwarts]] in the Harry Potter universe.

A subset of this type called '''familiar plot switch''' takes the characters from a series and places them in a setting more familiar to the author.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} This type of context shift is one of the main sources of '''"high school fic"''' in which all the characters are written going to high school. An example of this is the ''[[Charmed]]'' fanfiction "Charmingly High School" by AlwayWrittinSomethin, in which characters who never met until adulthood attend high school together.

==="Reality" swaps===
In a reality swap alternative universe (AU)—often in movies or television shows—the actors may find themselves in the fictional universe, the fictional characters may find themselves in the "real" universe, or the story may feature swaps both ways.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} This type of AU has appeared in mainstream publications as well. In ''[[Star Trek]]'' short stories written in the early 1970s, the actors from the [[Desilu Productions|Desilu]] set were swapped with the "real life" [[Starfleet]] officers via the [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] ("Visit To A Weird Planet"; "Visit To A Weird Planet, Revisited"). These fan fiction stories were eventually published in official ''Star Trek'' books. 

This concept was used also in an in-[[Canon (fiction)|canon]] episode of  ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', "The French Mistake" ([[Supernatural (season 6)|Season 6]], Episode 15). In the episode, two characters named Sam and Dean are transported to an alternative universe where they are actors named [[Jared Padalecki]] and [[Jensen Ackles]], respectively, on a television show called ''Supernatural''.

===Crossovers===
{{Further|Crossover (fiction)}}

This type of alternative universe places two fictional universes in a situation where they interact, similar to reality swaps (which mix a fictional universe with the real world).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Such stories sometimes involve '''comparisons or conflict''' between the combat prowess of the two universes, often involving the various strengths and weaknesses of the technology/magic of each world. An example is "A Thin Veneer" by AlbertG, in which ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' characters meet ''[[Babylon 5]]'' characters, setting off a galaxy-wide war. This genre of fanfiction is distinct from plot switch in the fact that it usually involves characters from at least two separate series interacting with one another.

Sometimes these stories involve the '''substitution''' of characters from one universe for those of another, as in "Return of the Aurors" by Anne Walsh. That fan fiction recasts ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' with ''[[Harry Potter]]'' characters, like 'Ron Solo' ([[Ron Weasley]] as [[Han Solo]]) and 'N-3LO' ([[Neville Longbottom]] as [[C-3PO]]). The story is played out in a Harry Potter-themed universe, visiting, for example, [[Dudley Dursley|Dursley]] [[Jabba the Hutt|the Hutt]]'s home on the desert planet of [[Quidditch]][[Tatooine|ine]].

A third example of crossover fiction would be when a '''team-up''' of heroes from multiple universes must defeat a team-up of villains from those same stories,{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} as in the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' [[television special]] ''[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]''. In this TV episode, several villains from the [[Marvel Universe]] team up with the show's usual villain, and a group of Marvel superheroes must team up with the show's protagonists to stop their plan to take over the world.

===Predictive fiction===
Alternative universes can arise inadvertently in fanfiction when the source material is released in a serial form (such as a multi-season television series or a book trilogy) so that fan works are written before further [[canon (fiction)|canonical information]] arrives. For instance, much ''[[Harry Potter]]'' fan fiction written in the nearly three years between the publication of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' was written as "continuation" fan fiction, but became AU as soon as the new canonical material appeared. An example is Arabella and Zsenya's "After the End", made AU by ''Order of the Phoenix'' the day after the story's completion. In "After the End", Harry's fifth year ended with his mentor [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s death, which did not happen in ''Order of the Phoenix'', but, coincidentally, did happen in the [[Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince|following novel]].

==Changing canon==
In alternative universe stories, characters' known motivations may vary considerably from their decisions in the canonical universe. The author of an alternative universe story thus can use the same characters, but send them down different paths to achieve a completely different plot.

On occasions, a fanfiction writer creates a character which does not exist in the actual story that inspired it. Gertrude 'Danger' Granger in Anne Walsh's ''Harry Potter'' AU series, the "Dangerverse," is an example of this, who is invented to serve as the wife of [[Remus Lupin]], one of Harry's friends and teachers. Changing canon can also mean taking a romantic relationship that was hinted but didn't actually happen, and expanding on it.

==In original fiction==
Alternative universes are also used in original fiction works themselves as an integral part of the storyline. The webcomic ''[[Sluggy Freelance]]'' had an alternative universe storyline which, while not integral, was revisited for another storyline.Many examples given above, in particular the [[What If (comics)|What If]] and [[Elseworld]] universes, have elements of AU fiction built into their canon.

In the many ''[[Gundam]]'' [[anime]] series, there are often six major timelines that are independent of one another, and some fan circles (especially in North America) refer to the timelines created after the original [[Universal Century]] as "alternative universes". However, this does not truly fit the standard definition of AU, as the timelines share neither characters nor locations (aside from the [[solar system]] itself). Some universes, especially when presented in two different formats (such as an anime television show and concurrent [[manga]] comic series), have two timelines which are similar but not identical, usually as a result of the difficulty of portraying certain scenes in both formats. Theoretically, both timelines are canon, but the differences sometimes escalate to the point where the two formats become essentially different stories.

The ''[[Star Wars: Infinities]]'' comic book series explores alternative universe fiction in a "what-if" style, diverging from the story of the original Star Wars trilogy movies at crucial moments, with a major impact on the evolving story. Exploring these questions from a different angle, the ''[[Stargate]]'' franchise has included episodes in which characters interact with alternative versions of themselves. In a similar fashion, several [[Star Trek]] episodes feature a "[[Mirror Universe]]" containing a very different history of events.

In the Lego ''[[Bionicle]]'' storyline, there are many alternative universes created whenever a character makes a decision or an event happens. For example, a universe was created when the character Toa Tuyet betrayed the city of Metru Nui and was defeated; in the alternative universe, Tuyet is aided by her comrade, Toa Nidhiki, and takes over Metru Nui. These alternative dimensions can be visited using a special mask called the Kanohi Olmak (Mask of Dimensional Gates). The anime, manga, and video game series ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni'' (as well as its spin-offs) focuses on AU arcs and alternative settings to reveal the secrets of the village named Hinamizawa. Likewise, book series ''Heroes in Real Harsh World'' and ''Trendy Baba Series'' by Mohit Trendster explore multiple story angles of different Indian comic book superheroes with experimental backdrops and contrasting elements.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] ''[[Doctor Who]]'' has alternative universe stories called "Unbound", which explore alternative Doctors.

'''An der Etsch und im Gebirge''' ([[German language|German]] for 'On the [[Adige|Etsch]] and in the Mountains') was a [[bailiwick]] (''Ballei'')  of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]], created about 1260 and headquartered in [[Bolzano]] (''Bozen''), now in the [[Italy|Italian]] province of [[South Tyrol]], comprising several [[commandry|commandries]] in the former [[County of Tyrol]] and the adjacent [[Bishopric of Trent]].

One of the Teutonic provinces within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], An der Etsch held the feudal status of [[Imperial immediacy]] as a registered [[Imperial State]]. Its [[commandry|commandries]] were subordinate to a ''Landkomtur'' (''commendator provincialis''), who himself was answerable to the ''Deutschmeister'' commander of all bailiwicks in [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]], at times directly to the [[Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights|Grand Master]].

[[File:Deutschhaus in Bozen (1910).jpg|thumb|left|Commandry (''Deutschhaus'') Bolzano]]

==History==
The Teutonic Knights had erected a first hospital at the confluence of Etsch and [[Eisack]] near Bozen in 1202, followed by several hostels along the mountain road up to the [[Brenner Pass]], vital for the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s heading for Italy or on [[crusades]] to the [[Holy Land]].

The bailiwick lost its autonomy during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] upon the 1805 [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]], when Tyrol was ceded to the newly established [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] and finally incorporated into the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1814. From the view of the  Teutonic Order, the province was never disestablished and up to today ''An der Etsch'' denotes the [[lay brother]]s' organisation in South Tyrol.

'''Batt Reef''' is a [[coral reef]] off [[Port Douglas, Queensland|Port Douglas]] in [[Shire of Douglas]], [[Queensland]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite QPN|1846|Batt Reef||accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Batt Reef is centred at {{coord|16|24|S|145|46|E|type:landmark_region:AU}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Gazetteer of Australia | name = Batt Reef | id = 124317}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of the [[Great Barrier Reef]].

The reef is about 18&amp;nbsp;km long by 5&amp;nbsp;km (11 miles by 3 miles) wide, lying northwest to southeast, at the northern side of [[Trinity Passage]] that leads from the inner Reef channel from [[Trinity Bay (Queensland)|Trinity Bay]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The north-west tip of the reef lies {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the Low Islets (Low and Woody Islands) which are in turn {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Newell Beach and {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Port Douglas, Queensland|Port Douglas]].

== History ==
The area received a high level of media attention following the death of ''[[The Crocodile Hunter]]'' star [[Steve Irwin]] on 4 September 2006 while filming an underwater documentary entitled ''[[Ocean's Deadliest]]''.

A '''Digital Line Graph''' (DLG) is a [[Cartography|cartographic]] map feature represented in digital [[Vector graphics|vector]] form that is distributed by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS).  DLGs are collected from USGS maps and are distributed in large-, intermediate- and small-scale with up to nine different categories of features, depending on the scale.  They come in optional and [[Spatial Data Transfer Standard]] (SDTS) format and  are [[topological structure|topologically structured]] for use in mapping and [[geographic information system]] (GIS) applications.

==Description==

[[File:Sub-watersheds of the Susquehanna River.png|thumb|Map produced with DLG data]]

DLGs are normally derived from USGS maps or USGS map-related sources.  DLGs are distributed at three different scales:  large-scale, which normally correspond to the USGS 7.5- by 7.5-minute, 1:24,000 and 1:25,000-scale topographic quadrangle map series, 1:63,360-scale for [[Alaska]] and 1:30,000-scale for [[Puerto Rico]]; intermediate scale, which are derived from the USGS 30- by 60-minute, 1:100,000-scale map series; and small-scale, which are derived from the USGS 1:2,000,000-scale sectional maps of the [[National Atlas of the United States]].  Large-scale DLGs are usually cast on the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]] (UTM), but are sometimes cast on the State Plane rectangular coordinate system.  Intermediate-scale DLGs are sold in 30- by 30-minute sections that correspond to the east or west half of the 100K quadrangle map, and each of the 30-minute sections is distributed in four 15- by 15-minute cells and  is cast on the UTM coordinate system.  Small-scale DLGs are sold in state units and are cast on either the [[Albers equal-area conic projection]] system or the [[geographic coordinate system]] of [[latitude and longitude]], depending on the distribution format.  All DLGs are referenced to the [[North American Datum]] of  1927 (NAD27) or the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).  USGS DLGs are [[Topological space|topologically structured]] for use in mapping and [[geographic information system]] (GIS) applications.

==Data categories==

Nine different categories of features, or layers, are available in DLGs:  [[Public Land Survey System]] (PLSS), [[Border|Boundaries]] (BD), Transportation (TR), [[Hydrography]] (HY), [[Hypsography]] (HP), Non-vegetative features (NV), Survey control and markers (SM), Man-made features (MS) and Vegetative surface cover (SC).  Large-scale DLGs offer all nine layers, while intermediate-scale DLGs offer the five layers of  PLSS, BD, TR, HY and HP.  Small-scale DLGs offer the five layers of PLSS, BD, TR, HY and MS.

==Distribution formats==

DLGs are available in two different formats:  optional format, a simple-to-use format that incorporates an 80-byte logical record length, the UTM ground coordinate system, and [[topological|topology]] linkages contained in line, node and area elements; and [[Spatial Data Transfer Standard]] (SDTS) format, a format that facilitates transferring of spatial data between different computer systems.

Large-scale DLGs are available in optional format and will also be available in SDTS format as the data from each state is converted.  Intermediate-scale DLGs are available in optional format and the HY and TR layers are also available in SDTS format.  Small-scale DLGs are available in both optional and SDTS formats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/factsheets/fs07896t.pdf USGS Fact Sheet, Digital Line Graphs]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Administrative divisions of Mongolia}}
{{Politics of Mongolia}}
A '''district''' ('''sum'''; {{lang-mn|сум}}, ''arrow'', sometimes spelled ''soum''  or—from the Russian form—as ''somon'') is a second level administrative subdivision of [[Mongolia]]. The 21 [[Provinces of Mongolia]] are divided into 331 districts.&lt;ref name="mongol"&gt;Montsame News Agency.  ''Mongolia''.  2006, Foreign Service office of [[Montsame News Agency]], {{ISBN|99929-0-627-8}}, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, each district administers a territory of {{convert|4200|km2|abbr=on}} with about 5,000 inhabitants, primarily nomadic herders. It{{clarify|date=April 2017}} has total revenues of 120 million [[Mongolian tögrög|Tögrög]], 90% of which comes from national subsidies.

Each district is again subdivided into ''bags'' (brigades; sometimes spelled ''baghs''&lt;ref name="mongol" /&gt;). Most bags are of an entirely virtual nature. Their purpose is to sort the families of nomads in the district into groups, without a permanent human settlement.

Officially, and occasionally on maps, many district seats (sum centers) bear a name different from that of the district. However, in practice the district seat (sum center) is most often referred to under the name of the district, to the point of the official name of the district seat (sum center) being unknown even to the locals.

[[File:Door to Heaven (Trongsa, Bhutan).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Trongsa Dzong]] in Bhutan.]]
One of '''Bhutan''''s significant natural resources in the late twentieth century was its rich [[forest]]s and natural [[vegetation]]. Bhutan's location in the eastern [[Himalayas]], with its subtropical plains and [[Alpine climate|alpine]] terrain, gives it more rainfall than its neighbors to the west, a factor greatly facilitating forest growth. The forests contain numerous [[deciduous]] and [[evergreen]] species, ranging from tropical hardwoods to predominantly [[oak]] and [[pine]] forests.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Worden, Robert L. "Forestry". [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bttoc.html ''A Country Study: Bhutan''] (Andrea Matles Savada, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (September 1991).

The small population and the general absence of overdevelopment in Bhutan contributed to forest preservation. Because of the terrain, the more accessible forests had been overcut whereas remote forests remained largely in their natural state. A progressive government-sponsored forestry conservation policy strove to balance revenue needs with ecological considerations, water management, and [[soil]] preservation. Success in managing its forest resources had long been critical to the local [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and economy and also affected downstream floodplains in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The [[Department of Forests and Park Services of Bhutan|Department of Forests and Park Services]] was established in 1952 as the Department of Forestry to oversee conservation and exploitation of the country's significant forestry resources. After an initial decade of development, forestry resource exploitation increased with the start of the First Development Plan in 1961. Uncontrolled felling of trees in the 1970s by private companies in logging areas and by rural populations along roads and in main valleys stripped hillsides and caused serious erosion. Tsheri cultivation, [[forest fire]]s, and overgrazing also contributed to the degradation of the forestry resource.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In 1971 the Forestry School was established at [[Kalikhola]] in southern Bhutan. It was moved to [[Taba, Bhutan|Taba]] in the northern [[Thimphu]] Valley in 1977. The school provided basic instruction in forestry and forest management and trained foresters and Forest Guards.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In 1981 some 33,000&amp;nbsp;km², or between 70 and 74 percent of the land, were forested, but in 1991 foreign estimates indicated a shrinking forest of only 60 to 64 percent of the land. Even more conservative estimates indicated that closer to 50 percent of Bhutan's territory still was forested in the late 1980s, and about 15 percent of [[GDP]] was produced through the nation's important forest industry.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

According to [[United Nations|UN]] statistics, in the decade between 1978 and 1987 Bhutan harvested an average of nearly 3.2 million cubic meters of roundwood and produced 5,000 cubic meters of sawn wood per year. Of this total, nearly 80 percent was for commercial use ([[paper pulp]], [[wood veneer|veneer]]s, [[plywood]], [[particle board]], and [[firewood]]), and the remainder was for housing construction and public works.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Conscientious Forestry==
[[File:Pinus wallichiana Bhutan2.jpg|thumb|Pinus wallichiana forest, Paro, Punakha, Taktshang, Bhutan.]]
Before [[hydroelectric power]] and other modern energy sources were available, wood was the almost exclusive source of fuel for heating, cooking, and lighting. The provision of [[electricity]], as well as better regulation of fuelwood collectors and more aggressive reforestation projects, was seen in the 1980s as a key factor in forest conservation. Because affordable electricity was not available throughout the country, the government established fuelwood plantations near villages to accommodate daily needs and to promote forest conservation.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Recognizing the potential value of its forestry resource, Bhutan became increasingly conscientious about forestry management in the 1970s. Starting in 1977, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] began supporting Bhutan's forest management through organizing forest ranger training programs, supplying funds for forest boundary demarcation, building guard posts, and constructing a patrol road for what was later to be designated the Royal Manas National Park. Bhutan rejected [[World Bank]] aid to build a major dam on the Manas Chhu in 1986 that would have flooded this major conservation area on the southern Bhutan-India border. By 1989 Bhutan had developed nine other forest and wildlife preserves, also mostly along the southern border with India.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Banning &amp; Standards==
In the face of increasing denuded hillsides, private logging was banned, and strict standards for public-sector logging operations were established in 1979. Farmers were warned against burning off forests to clear land for tsheri cultivation, and Forest Guards were trained in increasing numbers to help preserve the valuable resources. Surveying, demarcation, conservation, and management plans for harvesting forest products were part of the Fifth Development Plan's focus on forestry preservation. Wildlife sanctuaries also were developed.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

One of the immediate results of forestry sector regulation was a sharp decrease in revenues since the late 1970s. In 1991 the government, with assistance from [[UNDP]] and the World Wildlife Fund, established a [[trust fund]] for environmental conservation. Initially in the amount of US$20 million, the UNDP-administered fund was aimed at producing up to US$1 million per year for training in [[forestry]] and [[ecology]], surveying forests, reviewing and implementing management plans for protected areas, and supporting government environmental offices, public awareness programs, and integrated conservation and development programs.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

'''George Harry Dury''' (11 September 1916 – 4 October 1996)&lt;ref name="ODNB" &gt;James C. Knox, "Dury, George Harry (1916–1996)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2011)  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/101119 Retrieved 11 March 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00049189708703182?journalCode=cage20#preview George Dury 1919-1996: an appreciation]", ''[[Australian Geographer]]'', vol 28, no 1, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; was an English geographer and [[hydrologist]] who devised a model showing the relationship between river [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] and other stream variables.

==Life==
Dury was born at [[Hellidon]], near [[Daventry]], [[Northamptonshire]], the son of Harry Dury (1879–1961), an agricultural labourer then serving in the [[Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)|Royal West Surrey Regiment]], and his wife, Harriett Emma, née Colledge (1882–1959). He attended the grammar school in Daventry, and then took a BA degree (1937) and a teacher's diploma (1939) as an external student of the [[University of London]]. In 1937 he married Ina Gertrude Newton (1916–2005), daughter of George Lionel Newton, army pensioner, of [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. They had a daughter, Helen.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

While teaching at Elizabeth College, [[Guernsey]], in 1939, Dury and his family were evacuated before the German occupation. He was commissioned in the Royal Air Force in 1941 and assigned to photographic mapping. His mapping of Guernsey served also for his London University MA degree. His first post-war job was as a lecturer in geology and geography at Enfield Technical College in 1946–48. He then became a geography lecturer at [[Birkbeck College]], University of London (1949–62). Having retired to [[Risby, Suffolk|Risby]] near [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[Suffolk]], he died at the West Suffolk Hospital there in 1996.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

==Research==
Dury's model is an extension of the [[Bradshaw model]] which shows how river characteristics will change from the upper course to the lower course of a river. Dury used a line graph and a logarithmic scale, plotting the discharge along the x-axis and the other stream variables along the y-axis. Other 'stream variables' included depth, width, velocity, slope (gradient) and friction ([[Manning formula]]).

Dury's work on quantitative fluvial [[geomorphology]] led to a temporary period with the [[United States Geological Survey]] in 1960–61 and to co-authorship of the influential study ''Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology'' (with [[Luna Leopold|Luna B. Leopold]], [[M. Gordon Wolman]], and John Miller, 1964). Dury's most widely read book was ''The Face of the Earth'' (1959), published by [[Penguin Books]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7715">The '''geology of Mozambique''' is primarily extremely old [[Precambrian]] metamorphic and igneous crystalline basement rock, formed in the [[Archean]] and [[Proterozoic]], in some cases more than two billion years ago. Mozambique contains [[greenstone belts]] and spans the Zimbabwe Craton, a section of ancient stable crust. The region was impacted by major tectonic events, such as the mountain building Irumide orogeny, [[Pan-African orogeny]] and the [[Snowball Earth]] glaciation. Large basins that formed in the last half-billion years have filled with extensive continental and marine sedimentary rocks, including rocks of the extensive [[Karoo Supergroup]] which exist across southern Africa. In some cases these units are capped by volcanic rocks.  As a result of its complex and ancient geology, Mozambique has deposits of iron, coal, gold, mineral sands, bauxite, copper and other natural resources. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=180-183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stratigraphy, Tectonics &amp; Geologic History==
The oldest rocks in Mozambique are part of the [[Irumide Belt]], outcropping  near the border with Zimbabwe.  Over two billion years old, these rocks date to the [[Archean ]] and [[Paleoproterozoic]] and are an extension of [[greenstone belts]] and [[granite]]-[[gneiss]]es, within the [[Zimbabwe Craton]].

The [[schist]] of the greenstone belt is divided between the [[Manica Group]], [[Gairezi Group]] and [[Umkondo Group]], which together are the oldest individual rock units in the country. The formation of these schists and the Irumide Belt is tied to the Irumide orogeny about 1.35 billion years ago. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=180}}

===Proterozoic (2.5 billion-541 million years ago)===
During the [[Neoproterozoic]], the [[Pan-African orogeny]] emplaced granites and [[pegmatites]] throughout what is now Mozambique. This 250 million year tectonic event (which continued into the [[Phanerozoic Eon]]) overprinted many of the Precambrian rocks in Mozambique. The [[Snowball Earth]] global glaciation event 600 million years ago, at the same time as the orogeny began, left glacial sedimentary rocks in the [[Katangula Group]] in northwestern Mozambique, which is the same unit as the [[Katanga Supergroup]] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=180}}

===Paleozoic-Cenozoic (541 million-present)===
As the Pan-African orogeny continued, in parallel with the proliferation of multi-cellular life, a large rift formed across the south of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]] across what is now South Africa and southern South America. The [[Karoo Supergroup]], the most widely dispersed stratigraphic unit in southern Africa formed from the [[Carboniferous]] through the [[Early Jurassic]] in the [[Mesozoic]]. The [[Alto Zambezi Basin]], [[Rio Lunho Basin]] and [[Rio Lugenda Basin]], large intracratonal basins in Mozambique filled with sedimentary rocks. For the most part, the basins contain sequences of fluvial and glacial sediments, with layers of red mudstone with fossils and some coal layers. The Alto Zambezi Basin is capped by volcanic [[basalt]] and [[rhyolite]] in the south. 
Sedimentary rock formation continued in Mozambique along the coasts in the Jurassic, [[Cretaceous]] and into the [[Paleogene]] and [[Neogene]] periods of the [[Cenozoic]], with some sedimentary units formed in the past 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]]. Sedimentation shifted to different basins, including the [[Mozambique Basin]], [[Limpopo Basin]], [[Baixa Zambezi Basin]] and [[Rovuma Basin]]. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=180-182}}

==Hydrogeology==
South of the [[Save River (Africa)|Save River]], unconsolidated sediments are an important source of groundwater, overlying the Mozambique Basin. A 30 kilometer wide belt of dune sands occupies the southern coast of the country, atop Cretaceous and Paleogene rocks and form a moderately productive unconfined aquifer. Thick alluvium in the [[Limpopo River]] and [[Incomati River]] valleys forms a major aquifer in high porosity sands north of [[Maputo]]. 

Marine and continental sandstones dominate deeper Cretaceous-Paleogene sedimentary aquifers and some also contain layers of limestone. These underlying rocks in the Mozambique Basin form the largest aquifer, beneath 21% of the country. Cut by large river valleys, arkosic sandstones give way to limestone closer to the coast. North of the Save River, the basin is moderately productive, but to the south it has high salinity nearly unusable groundwater for much of its extent. The Rovuma Basin is poorly studied, but impermeable [[marl]] and high incidences of brackish groundwater suggest it would not be a major potential source. 
As much as 57% of Mozambique is directly underlain by Precambrian basement rock, which forms some small and locally productive aquifers in weathered rock near the surface. Mountain areas tend to have thicker weathered mantle, with most productive locations near fault zones. In northern Mozambique, average weathered rock cover is less than 20 meters thick, rising to as much as 50 meters in valleys. 
Fractured volcanic rocks form locally productive aquifers, producing high quality water, often in 10 to 20 meter thick weathered rock near the surface. However, weathered basalt often ends up with high clay concentrations, limiting productivity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Mozambique|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Mozambique#Hydrogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Mozambique has extensive natural resources, although most remain undeveloped. The [[Manica Belt]] is a continuation of the Mutare-Manica Gold Belt from Zimbabwe and contains iron, copper, asbestos, gold, lead and nickel hosted in an Archean and Paleoproterozoic greenstone belt. Small mines in the region have targeted placer gold in sediments in the area and there is also a small, high-grade [[bauxite]] deposit. The metasediments of [[Gairezi Group]] and [[Umkondo Group]] both host limestone, copper and iron near the border with Zimbabwe. 
Mozambique has four asbestos deposits. One has [[chrysotile]] asbestos crystals, separated by [[serpentinite]] in the [[Zimbabwe Craton]], near Manica. Others are in the Mozambique Belt, or associated with serpentinization south of Manica. Seven out of the nation's 10 provinces have graphite in Proterozoic rock associated with schist and gneiss. Semi-precious stones, [[feldspar]], [[beryl]] (including [[Aquamarine (gemstone)|aquamarine]] and [[morganite]]), [[mica]] and radioactive minerals are found with [[pegmatites]] in the Proterozoic rocks in [[Zambezia Province]] and [[Nampula Province]]. Elsewhere, in the northeast, pegmatite hosts lithium, bismuth, quartz, beryl, [[columbium]], antimony and [[tantalum]]. 

The [[Eocene]] [[Cheringoma Formation]] and the [[Miocene]] [[Jofane Formation]] contain limestone, [[halite]] and gypsum. Mozambique is also notable for beach sands between Quelimane and Angoche, laden with [[zircon]], [[rutile]], [[monazite]] and [[ilmenite]]. 
The country has 120 to 380 million tons of coal reserves in the bottom units of the Karoo Supergroup in the Rio Lunho Basin. The Cretaceous [[Grudja Formation]] in shows the most promise for potential hydrocarbons and Mesozoic sedimentary sequences in the north and south both have the possibility of future discoveries. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=182-183}}

'''Kaare Knutsson Münster Strøm''' (from 1949 only '''Kaare Strøm'''; 23 July 1902 &amp;ndash; 28 February 1967) was a Norwegian [[limnology|limnologist]].

He was born in [[Nord-Aurdal]] as a son of pharmacist Knut Thorstensen Strøm (1863–1938) and his wife Marianne Münster (1870–1943). He was a grandson of [[Christian Münster]]. He grew up in [[Oslo|Kristiania]], [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education at [[Frogner]] already in 1918, and began as a private student of [[Nordal Wille]]. He took the [[dr.philos.]] degree at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] in 1927 on the thesis ''Norwegian Mountain Algae''. He spent some time studying under [[August Thienemann]], and was a [[research fellow]] at the university from 1931 to 1936. He was promoted to [[docent]] in 1939 and professor in 1948. At first he was a professor in [[physical geography]] and [[limnology]], but from 1962 only in limnology. Strøm chaired the [[Norwegian Biological Society]] from 1934 to 1935, the [[Norwegian Geographical Association]] from 1944 to 1945 and the [[Norwegian Geographical Society]] from 1948 to 1949. He became a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Kaare Strøm|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Dag|last=Klaveness|authorlink=Dag Klaveness (limnologist)|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Kaare_Str%C3%B8m/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strøm was married to banker's daughter Agathe Hvistendahl from 1929 to 1949, and then to Kari Thorsen from December 1949. He died in February 1967 in [[Århus]], where he had a tenure as guest scholar.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

'''Land systems''' constitute the terrestrial component of the Earth system and encompass all processes and activities related to the human use of land, including socioeconomic, technological and organizational investments and arrangements, as well as the benefits gained from land and the unintended social and ecological outcomes of societal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verburg|first=Peter H|last2=Erb|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Mertz|first3=Ole|last4=Espindola|first4=Giovana|date=2013-10-01|title=Land System Science: between global challenges and local realities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343513000936|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|series=Human settlements and industrial systems|volume=5|issue=5|pages=433–437|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2013.08.001|pmc=4018982|pmid=24851141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes  in land systems have large consequences for the local environment and human well-being and are at the same time pervasive factors of global environmental change. Land provides vital resources to society, such as food, fuel, fibres and many other [[ecosystem services]] that support production functions, regulate risks of natural hazards, or provide cultural and spiritual services.  By using the land, society alters and modifies the quantity and quality of the provision of these services.

Land system changes are the direct result of human decision making at multiple scales ranging from local land owners decisions to national scale land use planning and global trade agreements. The aggregate impact of many local land system changes has far reaching consequences for the Earth System, that feedback on ecosystem services, human well-being and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crossman|first=Neville D|last2=Bryan|first2=Brett A|last3=de Groot|first3=Rudolf S|last4=Lin|first4=Yu-Pin|last5=Minang|first5=Peter A|date=2013-10-01|title=Land science contributions to ecosystem services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343513000729|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|series=Human settlements and industrial systems|volume=5|issue=5|pages=509–514|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2013.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, land system change is both a cause and consequence of socio-ecological processes.

The Global Land Programme (GLP) of [[Future Earth]] is an interdisciplinary community of science and practice fostering the study of land systems and the co-design of solutions for global sustainability.

'''Leaflet''' is a widely used [[Open-source license|open source]] [[JavaScript]] [[Library (computing)|library]] used to build [[web mapping]] [[Application software|applications]]. First released in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://robinlovelace.net/software/2014/03/05/webmap-test.html |title=Testing web map APIs - Google vs OpenLayers vs Leaflet |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103225922/http://robinlovelace.net/software/2014/03/05/webmap-test.html |archive-date=2017-11-03 |last=Lovelace |first=Robin |access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; it supports most mobile and desktop platforms, supporting [[HTML5]] and [[CSS3]]. Along with [[OpenLayers]], and the [[Google Maps API]], it is one of the most popular JavaScript mapping libraries and is used by major web sites such as [[Foursquare|FourSquare]], [[Pinterest]] and [[Flickr]].

Leaflet allows developers without a GIS background to very easily display [[tiled web map]]s hosted on a public server, with optional tiled overlays. It can load feature data from [[GeoJSON]] files, style it and create interactive layers, such as markers with popups when clicked.

It is developed by Vladimir Agafonkin, who joined [[Mapbox]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mapbox.com/blog/vladimir-agafonkin-joins-mapbox/ |title=Leaflet Creator Vladimir Agafonkin Joins MapBox |date=2014-08-06 |access-date=2018-11-03 |last=MacWright|first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
[[File:Leaflet example.png|thumb|A basic demo using Leaflet.]]
A typical use of Leaflet involves binding a Leaflet "map" element to an HTML element such as a [[Span and div|div]]. Layers and markers are then added to the map element.
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
 // create a map in the "map" div, set the view to a given place and zoom
 var map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);
 
 // add an OpenStreetMap tile layer
 L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
     attribution: '&amp;amp;copy; &lt;a href="http://osm.org/copyright"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; contributors'
 }).addTo(map);
&lt;/source&gt;
The Leaflet library itself is accessible through the variable &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt;.

==Features==
Leaflet supports [[Web Map Service]] (WMS) layers, [[GeoJSON]] layers, [[Vector graphics|Vector]] layers and Tile layers natively. Many other types of layers are supported via [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]].

Like other web map libraries, the basic display model implemented by Leaflet is one basemap, plus zero or more translucent overlays, with zero or more vector objects displayed on top.

=== Elements ===
The major Leaflet object types are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.4.html |title=Leaflet API reference |access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Raster types (TileLayer and ImageOverlay)
* Vector types (Path, Polygon, and specific types such as Circle)
* Grouped types (LayerGroup, FeatureGroup and GeoJSON)
* Controls (Zoom, Layers, etc.)
There is also a variety of utility classes such as interfaces for managing projections, transformations and interacting with the [[Document Object Model|DOM]].

=== Support for GIS formats ===
Leaflet has core support for few GIS standard formats, with others supported in plugins.

{|
! Standard !! Support
|-
| [[GeoJSON]] || Good, core support through the &lt;code&gt;geoJson&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/ |title=Using GeoJSON with Leaflet |access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| KML, CSV, WKT, TopoJSON, GPX || Supported in Leaflet-Omnivore plugin&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-omnivore&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Web Map Service|WMS]] || Core support through the &lt;code&gt;TileLayer.WMS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.4.html#tilelayer-wms |title=TileLayer.WMS |access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; subtype
|-
| [[Web Feature Service|WFS]] || Not supported, although 3rd party plugins exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/Georepublic/leaflet-wfs&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Geography Markup Language|GML]] || Not supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/547 |title=Support for GML |access-date=2018-11-03 |date=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

=== Browser support ===
Leaflet 0.7 supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari 5+, Opera 12+ and IE 7-11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://leafletjs.com/#features |title=Features |access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with other libraries ==
Leaflet is directly comparable with OpenLayers, as both are open source, client-side only JavaScript libraries. The library as a whole is much smaller, around 7,000 lines of code compared to OpenLayers' 230,000 (as of 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.openhub.net/p/compare?project_0=OpenLayers&amp;project_1=Leaflet |title=OpenHub.net comparison between OpenLayers and Leaflet |access-date=2018-11-03 |website=OpenHub.net |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808124119/https://www.openhub.net/p/compare?project_0=OpenLayers&amp;project_1=Leaflet |archive-date=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a smaller code footprint than OpenLayers (around 123 KB&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leaflet frontpage |url=https://leafletjs.com/ |website=Leaflet - An Open-Source JavaScript Library for Mobile-Friendly Interactive Maps |access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; vs 423 KB&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OpenLayers 3.4.0 compressed source code |url=http://openlayers.org/en/v3.4.0/build/ol.js |publisher=OpenLayers.org |access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) due partly to its modular structure. The code base is newer, and takes advantage of recent features of JavaScript, plus HTML5 and CSS3. However, Leaflet lacks features OpenLayers supports, such as [[Web Feature Service]] (WFS)&lt;ref&gt;Various plugins providing WFS-support are listed on https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html&lt;/ref&gt; and native support for projections other than Google [[Web Mercator]] (EPSG 3857).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.4.html#projection |title=Projection |access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also comparable to the proprietary, closed source [[Google Maps API]] (debuting in 2005) and [[Bing Maps API]], both of which incorporate a significant server-side component to provide services such as [[geocoding]], [[routing]], search and integration with features such as Google [[Google Earth|Earth]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Google Maps API provides speed and simplicity, but is not flexible, and can only be used to access Google Maps services. The new DataLayer part of Google's API does allow external data sources to be displayed, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/datalayer |title=Data Layer |publisher=Google |work=Google Maps Platform |access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Leaflet began life in 2010 as "Web Maps API", a JavaScript library for the CloudMade mapping provider, where Agafonkin worked at the time. In May 2011, CloudMade announced the first release of Leaflet, built from scratch but using parts of the old API code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.cloudmade.com/2011/05/13/announcing-leaflet-a-modern-open-source-javascript-library-for-interactive-maps/ |title=Announcing Leaflet: a Modern Open Source JavaScript Library for Interactive Maps |date=2011-05-13 |access-date=2018-11-03 |website=CloudMade |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140811222442/http://blog.cloudmade.com/2011/05/13/announcing-leaflet-a-modern-open-source-javascript-library-for-interactive-maps/ |archive-date=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lee and windward shores - lake.GIF|thumb|right|300px|A lee shore is one that is to the lee side of a vessel — meaning the wind is blowing towards it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sail Power |author=Wallace Ross |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee (green) and windward (red) shores of a lake, given wind from due east (white arrows).]]
'''Lee shore''', sometimes also called '''leeward''' and '''ward shore''',  is a [[Seamanship|nautical]] term used to describe a stretch of [[shoreline]] that is to the lee side of a vessel — meaning the wind is blowing towards it. A weather shore has the wind blowing from inland over it out to sea. For example, a person standing on a shore when the wind is blowing out to sea (or any large body of water) is standing on a weather shore. If the wind is blowing into shore from the sea, the person is on a lee shore.

==Definitions and pronunciation==
By definition, "windward" is the side of an island where the predominant wind travels from the sea onto the island. "Leeward" is the side of an island where the predominant wind travels from the interior of the island to the sea.

The definition of "leeward" is based on its usage: 
Adjective: on the side away from the wind; "on the leeward side of the island".
Adverb: toward [in the direction of] the wind; "they were sailing leeward".
Noun: the side of something that is sheltered from the wind, or the direction in which the wind is blowing; "to the leeward".
''The traditional nautical pronunciations are the elided forms /ˈljuːərd/[1] and /ˈwɪnərd/, pronounced "loowerd" where the first syllable is spoken very briefly, almost as "l'ward". The literal pronunciations, /ˈliːwərd/ and /ˈwɪndwərd/, are now more common, and "lee" by itself is always pronounced as it is spelled. The pronunciation for the Leeward and Windward Islands and the Leeward Antilles is normally the latter form, with the long "e".''

=="Windward", "leeward", and "lee"==
The windward shore is a lee shore for vessels traveling offshore, and that shore is "to leeward" of the vessel, but that does not make it the leeward shore of the island. Although the terms are often confused, "the lee shore" is different from "a leeward shore" based on the reference point from which the shore is viewed. Notice the different articles "the" and "a" — "the" windward or leeward shore versus "a" lee shore. The shore that is a lee shore changes based on the reference point, which is the vessel from which the island or lake shore is viewed, and of which the island or lake shore is in the lee. The leeward shore does not change based on the position of the vessel. This means that the "leeward side" of the vessel and the "lee shore" of the land face opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;Capt. James C. Van Pelt III&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leeward and windward shores==
To someone on a vessel, the shore to lee of the vessel is the lee shore, and since that is the shore the wind reaches first, to someone on the shore it is the windward shore. "Lee" historically means "shelter". Standing on the leeward side of the vessel, a sailor observes being blown towards an exposed shoreline by the wind. Here again the reference point from which a shore is viewed determines whether it is the lee shore or a leeward shore. On a lake, the reference point is a body of water, so the windward shore is upwind of the center of the lake. On an island, the reference point is a landmass, so the windward shore is the shore upwind (most to windward) of the center of the island. On a vessel, however, the windward rail is the one the wind is hitting first, or the one most upwind. The same is true regarding an island: the side of the island most to windward is the windward shore. 

==Dangers of a weather shore==
A weather shore is potentially treacherous for kitesurfers and windsurfers, who can be blown out to sea if the wind is blowing from the land. For them, a lee shore is safer. For ocean-going vessels during a storm, a lee shore is treacherous because the wind slowly forces the vessel toward the shore, where it will beach or break up. For this reason [[Bernard Moitessier]], the great ocean sailor, called the coastline "the great whore"; it attracts sailors during a storm but is in fact highly dangerous. In shallow coastal water, maneuvering is impaired, waves may become steeper, and objects may be obscured. Navigating during a storm, either by chart or by [[dead reckoning]], becomes extremely difficult. A storm surge may make the entrance to a protected body of water prohibitively treacherous or impossible to locate. Heavy weather tactics more often dictate heading out to sea, where deeper water and more room for maneuver allow a sailboat to [[heaving to|heave to]] or adopt other defensive measures. In landsmen's parlance, this is called "riding out the storm."

==Dangers of a lee shore and a windward shore==
Lee shores are dangerous to watercraft because, if left to drift, they will be pushed into shore by the wind, possibly running aground.  [[Sailboat]]s are particularly susceptible to this, as even under sail they are limited to the angle they can travel into the wind; [[Square rig]]ged craft, for instance, can point only slightly to windward.  It is possible for a sailing vessel to become trapped along a lee shore, with the only recourse being to use an engine, or use [[anchor]]s to [[Anchor#Kedging|kedge]] out.  The beach of a lee shore in a storm is also at a significantly higher risk due to the undiminished effects of the wind and waves.  Because of this, it is always preferable to travel along a windward shore, especially in inclement weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing |author=Dixon Kemp, Brooke Heckstall-Smith |publisher=Horace Cox |year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Kedge-anchor; Or, Young Sailors' Assistant |author=William N. Brady |year=1864}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A windward shore will have significantly lower waves and slower winds, because they will have been slowed by passage over the land, but a windward shore does have its dangers, being subject to [[storm surge]]. Numerous [[shipwrecks]] have been caused by vessels driven onto a lee shore.

==In literature==
{{essay-like|section|date=August 2013}}
{{one source|section|date=August 2013}}
In [[Herman Melville]]'s [[Moby Dick]], the lee shore is figured into one of American literature's transcendent passages:

"Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that's kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship's direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again; for refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!

"Know ye, now, Bulkington? Glimpses do you seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore?

"But as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God — so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing — straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!" (Chapter 23, "The Lee Shore")

==In music==
[[David Crosby]] wrote a song "The Lee Shore". This was recorded with [[Stephen Stills]] and [[Graham Nash]] at Stills' house, in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles on December 28, 1969, but originally released in a live version on the album ''Four Way Street'', on April 17, 1971.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Fracture zone]]s are common features in the geology of oceanic basins. Globally most fault zones are located on [[divergent plate boundary|divergent plate boundaries]] on [[oceanic crust]]. This means that they are located around [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and trend perpendicular to them. The term fracture zone is used almost exclusively for features on [[oceanic crust]]; similar structures on [[continental crust]] are instead termed [[transform fault|transform or strike slip faults]], a denomination active fracture zones also can have. Some fracture zones have been created by mid-ocean ridge segments that have been [[subduction|subducted]] and may not longer exist.

==Pacific Ocean==

Most fracture zones in the Pacific Ocean originate from large mid-ocean ridges (also called "rises") such as the [[East Pacific Rise]], [[Chile Rise]] and [[Juan de Fuca Ridge]]. The plates that host the fractures are [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]], [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]], [[antarctic Plate|Antarctic]], [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]] and [[Cocos Plate|Cocos]] among others. Fracture zones being [[subduction|subducted]] under Southern and Central America are generally southwest-northeast oriented reflecting the relative motion of Cocos, Nazca and the Antarctic Plates.

===Chile Rise===
The fracture zones of the [[Chile Rise]] trend in a west to east fashion with the most southern ones taking a slightly more southwest to northeast orientation. This non-perpendicular relation to Chile’s coast reflects the oblique subduction of Nazca Plate under southern Chile. West of Chile rise the fracture zones are hosted in the Antarctic Plate. Some fracture zones such as [[Chile Fracture Zone|Chile]] and [[Valdivia Fracture Zone|Valdivia]] make up large sections of the Nazca-Antarctic Plate boundary.

==Atlantic Ocean==
In the Atlantic Ocean most fracture zones originate from the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], which runs from north to south, and are therefore west to east oriented in general. There are about 300 fracture zones, with an average north-south separation of {{convert|55|km|mi|0}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Mi-Oc/Mid-Ocean-Ridges.html |title=Mid-Ocean-Ridges |first1=Larry |last1=Gilman |first2=K. Lee| last2=Lerner |date= |year= |work=Water Encyclopedia |publisher= |location= |page= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; two for each degree of latitude. Physically it makes sense to group Atlantic fracture zones into three categories:&lt;ref name=dietmarwalter /&gt;
# Small offset: length of transform fault less than {{convert|30|km|mi|0}}
# Medium offset: offset over 30 kilometers
# Large offset: offset several hundreds of kilometers

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6440">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in the Cook Islands'''. There are seven mammal species in the [[Cook Islands]], of which one is labelled as being a vulnerable species.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| EX ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| EW ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| CR ||'''Critically endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| EN ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| VU ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1879">'''Uruguay [[postal code]]s''' are 5-digit numeric codes. The first two digits of each code correspond to a [[Departments of Uruguay|department]]&amp;mdash; [[Uruguay]]'s internal administrative divisions&amp;mdash;unless the first digit is 1, which corresponds to the capital, [[Montevideo]]. The zones so determined are called '''Zonas Postales'''.

The remaining digits of the code are either zeros for the capital of the department or the city of Montevideo as a whole, or else take specific values for other cities in the department or for local zones in Montevideo.

The following list shows the postal codes for the capitals of each department. Names of capitals differing from those of the departments are shown in parentheses.

The '''Meades Ranch Triangulation Station''' is a survey marker in [[Osborne County, Kansas|Osborne County]]&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt; in the state of [[Kansas]] in the [[Midwestern United States]].  The marker was initially placed in 1891; from 1901 to 1989, it was the reference location relative to which all locations in the United States were measured, and from 1913 to 1989, it was the reference location for all surveys in the continent.

In 1973, the site was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as '''Geodetic Center of the United States'''.

==History==
{{Main|North American Datum}}
In surveying, a [[geodetic datum]] is a point or set of points used to establish a coordinate system.  By designating the location of one point, and the direction from that point to a second point, one can establish a system relative to which other points can be located and mapped.  As one surveys a larger area over which the curvature of the Earth becomes significant, it also becomes necessary to define an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]]: a curved surface that approximates the shape of the Earth in the area of interest.&lt;ref name=introdatums/&gt;&lt;ref name=systems/&gt;

The first nationwide datum in the United States was established in 1879.  At that time, a region of contiguous triangulation existed from Maine to Georgia.  The New England Datum was chosen with a benchmark in Maryland, near the middle of this region, as the horizontal datum, and a second Maryland mark used to define the [[azimuth]] (horizontal) direction.&lt;ref name=noaahist/&gt;  To account for the Earth's curvature, the datum used a model called the [[Alexander Ross Clarke|Clarke]] spheroid, developed in 1866.&lt;ref name=ontario/&gt;

===Meades Ranch station===
The [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] established a [[triangulation station]], officially known as the Meades Ranch Triangulation Station, in 1891.  The location lay near the intersection of two transcontinental arcs of triangulation: one running from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, roughly following the 39th parallel; the other running from Mexico to Canada, along the 98th meridian.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;&lt;ref name=trikan/&gt;&lt;ref name=schoewe/&gt;

In 1901, the Meades Ranch station was chosen as the United States standard horizontal [[Geodetic datum|datum]]: the point relative to which all land measurements in the nation were made.  The choice was based on the station's location near the [[Geographic center of the contiguous United States|geographic center of the U.S.]] and near the intersection of the two arcs of triangulation, and because it minimized the number of changes in previously published positions.  Its position was officially set as 39°13'26.686"&amp;nbsp;N and 98°32'30.506"&amp;nbsp;W; the [[azimuth]] direction to a triangulation station near [[Waldo, Kansas|Waldo]], southwest of Meades Ranch, was officially set as 75°28'14.52" west of south.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;&lt;ref name=noaahist/&gt;&lt;ref name=trikan/&gt;

In 1913, the chief astronomer of the [[Dominion Observatory|Dominion of Canada Astronomical Observatory]] and the director of the Comisión Geodésica Mexicana announced that their organizations would use the Meades Ranch location as their standard datum.  In light of this, its name was changed to the "North American Datum".&lt;ref name=trikan/&gt;

[[File:Horizontal Control Network of the United States June 1931.jpg|thumb|alt=Map of United States with networks of triangles running roughly north-south and east-west across country; empty spaces several hundred miles wide in between|Horizontal survey control network in the United States in 1931]]

As more new surveys and previously isolated survey networks were incorporated into the system, it became increasingly difficult to make the necessary corrections.  By the mid-1920s, it was realized that the coordinate system needed to be adjusted.  From 1927 to 1932, the approximately 25,000 existing control locations were recalculated and a new coordinate system developed, known as NAD27.  The new system continued to use the 1901 coordinates of Meades Ranch as its horizontal datum, and the Clarke spheroid as its model for the Earth's surface.  However, it now defined horizontal directions in terms of 175 Laplace azimuths, which use astronomical azimuths corrected for the difference between the astronomic and geodetic meridians.  Under NAD27, the azimuth to the Waldo station changed by about 5".&lt;ref name=systems/&gt;&lt;ref name=noaahist/&gt;&lt;ref name=ontario/&gt;&lt;ref name=azimuths/&gt;&lt;ref name=penry/&gt;

In 1973, the Meades Ranch site was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]], under the name "Geodetic Center of the United States".&lt;ref name=nrhpob/&gt;

===NAD83===
Following the establishment of NAD27, it was noted that it produced a discrepancy of about {{convert|10|m|sp=us}} in latitudes in the northern part of the northern U.S. state of [[Michigan]], necessitating a regional adjustment for the states of Michigan and [[Wisconsin]].  As the survey network was extended further north into Canada, similar discrepancies appeared.  The problem proved to be systemic: It had been assumed that the differences between the Clarke spheroid and the actual geoid were negligible, whereas these differences actually introduced significant errors.  The relatively small number and large separation of the points used to develop NAD27, the limited computational power available to its designers, and the movement of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] also led to inconsistencies in NAD27 coordinates.&lt;ref name=ontario/&gt;&lt;ref name=schwarz-9-10/&gt;

[[File:Datum Shift Between NAD27 and NAD83.png|thumb|alt=Map of lower-48 states, color-coded to indicate differences; an area around Indiana is at zero; the east coast is generally between 20 and 50 meters; Washington, Oregon, western Nevada, and most of California are between 80 and 100 meters|Changes in horizontal location between NAD27 and NAD83]]

To address these, a new datum was developed, designated NAD83.  It replaced the Clarke spheroid with a new ellipsoid, the Geographic Reference System 1980, centered at the Earth's [[center of mass]] as determined by the [[International Time Bureau|Bureau International de l'Heure]].  The new datum was based on adjustment of 250,000 points, including 600 [[Satellite geodesy|satellite Doppler stations]].  NAD83 was officially adopted by the U.S. government in 1989, and by the Canadian government in 1990.  Under the new system, Meades Ranch lost its special standing, and became one of thousands of stations.&lt;ref name=penry/&gt;&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt;&lt;ref name=noaafaq/&gt;&lt;ref name=nad83in89/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:North America geodetic center - replica plaque 1.JPG|thumb|alt=Stone marker with embedded bronze disc; marker reads "This bronze disc is a replica of the actual marker for the geodetic center of North America, located south of Osborne.  Placed by the Osborne Area Chamber of Commerce."|Marker at Osborne rest area, incorporating replica of Meades Ranch station marker disc]]

As of 2012, the location of the Meades Ranch station was {{coord|39|13|26.71220|N|98|32|31.74540|W|display=inline}}.  It lies about {{convert|12|mi}} north of [[Lucas, Kansas|Lucas]] and about {{convert|10|mi}} southwest of [[Tipton, Kansas|Tipton]].&lt;ref name=datasheet/&gt;

The station is on a low grassy ridge in a pasture.  It is marked by a bronze disc, inscribed "Meades Ranch 1891", embedded in the top of a dome-shaped concrete marker {{convert|21|in|cm}} in diameter, rising about {{convert|4|in|cm}} above ground level.  Two reference marks and an azimuth mark are located nearby.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;&lt;ref name=datasheet/&gt;

The Meades Ranch station is on private land, with no public access.&lt;ref name=tour/&gt;  A replica of the station marker, with a Kansas historical marker explaining its significance, is located at {{coord|39.452286|-98.693542|display=inline}}, in a roadside rest area beside [[U.S. Highway 281]] at the northern edge of [[Osborne, Kansas]], {{convert|18|mi}} northwest of the Meades Ranch site.&lt;ref name=histmark/&gt;

'''''One's Company: A Journey to China''''', (London: Cape, 1934), is a travel book by [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]], correspondent for ''[[The Times|The Times of London]]'', describing his journey day-by-day from London through Moscow and the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], then through Japanese-run [[Manchukuo]], then on to [[Nanking]], the capital of China in the 1930s, with a glimpse of “Red China”. It was reissued (with ''[[News from Tartary]]'') as half of ''Travels in Tartary''.

Fleming's Preface opens with a self-deprecating observation:

:The recorded history of Chinese civilization covers a period of four thousand years.
:The Population of China is estimated at 450 million.
:China is larger than Europe.
   
:The author of this book is twenty-six years old.
:He has spent, altogether, about seven months in China.
:He does not speak Chinese.

British in its insouciant class condescension (Moscow was like a “servant’s quarters”) and offhand anti-Semitism (the Soviet Union is run by Jews), the tone is imperially comic and the judgments quick, though always focused on the author. When Fleming gets to China, the reader is rewarded with acid portraits of [[Chiang Kai-shek]], pronouncements on “Red China” and the prospects of Communism (it could never take hold in China), life on the war fronts, and the nature of the Japanese empire.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Fussell, ''Abroad: British Literary Traveling Between the Wars'' (1980 {{ISBN|0195030680}}) Pp. 13-14, 92, 117-18, 167, 174-175, 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas J. Clifford observes: “If for Fleming... China remained something of a joke, the joke was less on the country than on the bemused traveler himself.... Even so, the humor ... can sometimes wear a little thin.... there was much about it that still had the aspect of a comic opera land whose quirks and oddities became grist for the writer rather than deserving any respect or sympathy in themselves.” &lt;ref&gt;''"A Truthful Impression of the Country": British and American Travel Writing in China, 1880-1949''  (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0472111973}}), 132-33.&lt;/ref&gt; However, one unsympathetic commentator recently described it as "largely a litany of visits to places he didn't like -- except England." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianreviewofbooks.com/arb/article.php?article=481 Paul French, ''Asia Review of Books'' (December 4, 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact ethnic or national '''origin of [[Christopher Columbus]]''' (1451-1506) has been a source of speculation since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Heers, Jacques. "''Christophe Colomb.''" Hachette, 1981. p. 21-23. Retrieved 2008-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The general consensus among historians is that Columbus' family was from the coastal region of [[Liguria]], that he spent his boyhood and early youth in the [[Republic of Genoa]], in [[Genoa]], in Vico Diritto, and that he subsequently lived in [[Savona]], where his father Domenico moved in 1470. Much of this evidence derives from data concerning Columbus' immediate family connections in Genoa and opinions voiced by contemporaries concerning his Genoese origins, which few dispute.

== Genoese origin ==

=== Documents ===

In a 1498 deed of primogeniture, Columbus writes:

{{Quote|''Siendo yo nacido en Genova... de ella salí y en ella naci...''&lt;ref&gt;Irving, Washington. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QfbXIiVrzzQC&amp;pg ''The Complete Works of Washington Irving''], Elibron.com. p. 877. Retrieved 2010-12-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;A copy of this document, which dates back to the early seventeenth century and had been officially sent from [[Crown of Castile]] to the [[Republic of Genoa]], is conserved in the State Archives of Genoa. The supposed original is in the [[Archivo General de Indias]] in Seville.&lt;/ref&gt; | &lt;small&gt;As I was born in Genoa... came from it and was born there...&lt;/small&gt;|}}

Many historians, including a distinguished Spanish scholar, Altolaguirre, affirm the document's authenticity; others believe it apocryphal.{{#tag:ref|De Lollis observes that "the history of this important document is so clear that there is no doubt about its authenticity." Caddeo considers it authentic. Harrisse instead considers it a forgery from a later period. Madariaga states that the majorat "cannot be considered authentic," but adds, however, that it cannot be a complete invention and must have been edited on the basis of the 1502 testament, which has disappeared without a trace. Ballesteros refutes that thesis that it is a forgery; the authenticity of the document is proven by the rediscovery of a certificate, dated 28 September 1501, relative to the royal confirmation of the majorat in the archive of Simancas: "After this discovery the authenticity of the institution of the Columbus majorat has been clearly demonstrated and the historical clauses of the document have increased in value, as have Columbus's declarations regarding his Geonese birthplace."&lt;ref name="Taviani 10"&gt;Taviani, Paolo Emilio. ''Cristoforo Colombo: Genius of the Sea'' (Volume II). Italian Academy Foundation, 1991. pp. 5-37. Retrieved 2011-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt; This document was declared to be "worth the same as a blank piece of paper" by the Spanish tribunal when Baltazar Colombo presented it and the document rejected as not authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Alegacion en Derecho por Doña Francsica Colon de Toledo, sobre la sucession en possession del Estado y Ducado de Veragua. En Madrid, por Luis Sanchez. Año MDCVIII sobre el Almirantazgo de las Indias, Ducado de Veragua, y Marquesado de Jamaica.&lt;/ref&gt; The certificate dated 28 September 1501 is merely a copy of Columbus 1497 royal confirmation of the authorization to institute a majorat and it has none of the text in it that is in the "1598" majorat. Navarrete states that there is no authentic ''Majorat of 1498'', there is only the document presented by Baltazar Colombo which the tribunal rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández de Navarrete, Martín. ''Colección de los viajes y descubrimientos que hicieron por mar los españoles'' (Buenos Aires: Editorial Guaranía, 1945-46). (First Edition printed in Madrid, 1825). Vol. II, 235.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} Some believe that the fact that it was produced in court, during a lawsuit among the heirs of Columbus, in 1578, does not strengthen the case for its being genuine.&lt;ref name="Paolo Emilio Taviani"&gt;Taviani, Paolo Emilio. [https://books.google.com/books?id=toILAAAAYAAJ&amp;q ''Christopher Columbus: the grand design''], Orbis, 1985. pp. 17-500. Retrieved 2011-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter from Columbus, dated 2 April 1502, to the [[Bank of Saint George]], the oldest and most reputable of Genoa's financial institutions, begins with the words:

{{Quote|''Bien que el coerpo ande aca el coracon esta ali de continuo...''&lt;ref&gt;Columbus, Christopher. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKgKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg ''The authentic letters of Columbus'' (Volume I).] Field Columbian Museum, 1894. p. 129. Retrieved 2010-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; | &lt;small&gt;Though my body is here, my heart is constantly there...&lt;/small&gt;|}}

Although a few people consider this letter suspect, the vast majority of scholars believe it genuine. The most scrupulous examination by graphologists testifies in favour of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Taviani, Paolo Emilio. [https://books.google.com/books?id=toILAAAAYAAJ&amp;q= ''Christopher Columbus: The Grand Design''], Orbis, 1985. p. 17. Retrieved 2015-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter is one of a group of documents entrusted by Columbus to a Genoese friend, after the bitter experiences of his third voyage, before setting out on his fourth.

In the spring of 1502, Columbus collected notarized copies of all the writings concerned with his rights to the discovery of new lands. He sent these documents to Nicolò Oderico, ambassador of the Republic of Genoa. To this same Oderico he handed over the letter to the Bank of Saint George, in which he announced that he was leaving the bank one-tenth of his income, with a recommendation for his son Diego. Oderico returned to Genoa and delivered the letter to the bank, which replied, on 8 December 1502 lauding the gesture of their "renowned fellow-citizen" towards his "native land". The reply, unfortunately, never reached its destination; Columbus, back in Castile after his fourth voyage, complained about this in another letter to Ambassador Oderico, dated 27 December 1504, and promptly annulled the bequest.

The first letter was preserved in the archives of the Bank of Saint George until it was taken over by the municipality of Genoa; the other three remained in the Oderico family archives until 1670, when they were donated to the [[Republic of Genoa]]. After the fall of the Republic, they passed to the library of one of its last senators, Michele Cambiaso, and were finally acquired by the city of Genoa.  There are also public and notarial acts (more than a hundred) — copies of which are conserved in the archives of [[Genoa]] and [[Savona]] — regarding Columbus's father, Columbus himself, his grandfather, and his relatives.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In May 2006, the Dr. Aldo Agosto, a noted Columbus scholar and state archivist at Genoa, has collected — to be officially presented to the conference of studies in [[Valladolid]] — one hundred and ten notarial documents, largely unpublished. Agosto claims these documents reconstruct the family tree of Christopher Columbus, going back as far as seven generations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another doubt remains to be settled: can we be sure that all of the documents cited concern the Christopher Columbus who was later to become ''Cristóbal Colón'', admiral of the Ocean Sea in Spanish territory? The list of contemporary [[#The testimony of the ambassadors|ambassadors]] and [[#Confirmation of the Genoese origin from contemporary European writers|historians]] unanimous in the belief that Columbus was Genoese could suffice as proof, but there is something more: a document dated 22 September 1470 in which the criminal judge convicts [[Domenico Colombo]]. The conviction is tied to the debt of Domenico — together with his son Christopher (explicitly stated in the document) — toward a certain Girolamo del Porto. In the will dictated by Admiral Christopher Columbus in Valladolid before he died, the authentic and indisputable document which we have today, the dying navigator remembers this old debt, which had evidently not been paid. There is, in addition, the  act drawn in Genoa on 25 August 1479 by a notary, Girolamo Ventimiglia.&lt;ref&gt;File 2, relating to the years 1474-1504, no. 266. Retrieved 2010-12-21.&lt;/ref&gt; This act is known as the ''Assereto document'', after the scholar who found it in the State Archives in Genoa in 1904. It involves a lawsuit over a sugar transaction on the Atlantic island [[Madeira]]. In it, young Christopher swore that he was a 27-year-old Genoese citizen resident in Portugal and had been hired to represent the Genoese merchants in that transaction. Here was proof that he had relocated to Portugal. It is important to bear in mind that at the time when Assereto traced the document, it would have been impossible to make an acceptable facsimile.&lt;ref name="Paolo Emilio Taviani"/&gt; Nowadays, with modern chemical processes, a document can be "manufactured", made to look centuries old if need be, with such skill that it may be difficult to prove it is a fake. In 1960, this was still impossible.&lt;ref name= "Paolo Emilio Taviani"/&gt;&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;In light of the two acts cited, the tendency to compare, or worse, to confuse or replace the true "Genoese" Columbus family with other similarly named Ligurian, Lombard or foreign families collapses, as does the main argument of the dilettantes who oppose the Genoese documentation and try to maintain that there was indeed a Genoese Christopher Columbus, woolen-weaver, but who was not the discoverer of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the two documents cited, there are others that confirm the identification of the Genoese Christopher Columbus, son of Domenico, with the admiral of Spain. An act dated 11 October 1496 says:&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, Silvio A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E2x1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q= ''The Christopher Columbus Encyclopedia'' (Volume I).] Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992. p. 163. Retrieved 2011-02-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
{{Quote|Giovanni Colombo of Quinto, Matteo Colombo and Amighetto Colombo, brothers of the late Antonio, in full understanding and knowledge that said Giovanni must go to Spain to see ''M. Christopher Columbus, Admiral of the King of Spain'', and that any expenses that said Giovanni must make in order to see said M. Christopher must be paid by all three of the aforementioned brothers, each one to pay a third ... and to this they hereby agree.}}

In a fourth notarial act, drawn in [[Savona]] on 8 April 1500, Sebastiano Cuneo, heir by half to his father Corrado, requested that Christopher and Giacomo (called Diego), the sons and heirs of Domenico Colombo, be summoned to court and sentenced to pay the price for two lands located in Legine. This document confirms Christoforo and Diego's absence from the Republic of Genoa with these exact words: "dicti conventi sunt absentes ultra Pisas et Niciam."&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;"The summoned parties are absent and beyond Pisa and Nice."&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
A fifth notarial act, drawn in Savona on 26 January 1501, is more explicit. A group of Genoese citizens, under oath, said and say, together and separately and in every more valid manner and guise, that Christopher, Bartholomew and Giacomo Columbus, sons and heirs of the aforementioned Domenico, their father, have for a long time been absent from the city and the jurisdiction of Savona, as well as Pisa and Nice in Provence, and that they reside in the area of Spain, as was and is well known.
	 
Finally, there is a very important sixth document from the notary of Bartolomeo Oddino, drawn in Savona on 30 March 1515. With this notarial act, [[Leon Pancaldo]], the well-known Savonese who would become one of the pilots for [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s voyage, sends his own father-in-law in his place as procurator for [[Diego Columbus]], son of Admiral Christopher Columbus. The document demonstrates how the ties, in part economic, of the discoverer's family with Savona survived even his death.

===''The life of Admiral Christopher Columbus by his son Ferdinand'' ===

A biography written by Columbus's son Ferdinand (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and translated to [[Italian language|Italian]]), ''Historie del S. D. Fernando Colombo; nelle quali s'ha particolare, et vera relatione della vita, et de' fatti dell'Ammiraglio D.

Retrieved 2011-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The first nineteen of this book's fifty chapters were published in 1535, the first full version in 1851. This biography of Columbus was translated into Italian by Alfonso de Ulloa and printed for the first time in Venice in 1571.&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Alfonso de Ulloa was a Spaniard born in Caceres in 1529. His father, Francisco, fought for the emperor Charles V and in 1552 came to Venice as a secretary of the Spanish ambassador [[Diego Hurtado de Mendoza (poet and diplomat)|Diego Hurtado de Mendoza]]. Ulloa knew Italian so well that he rendered Spanish and Portuguese works into that language. His most famous translation is the ''Vita dell'Ammiraglio'', 1571, "Ferdinand Columbus's life of his father," a book now of priceless value, because the original does not survive. The eminent American historian [[Washington Irving]] described the ''Vita'' as "an invaluable document, entitled to great faith, and is the corner-stone of the history of the American continent."&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=exvKTqj6LoaYhQeJ-vjMDw&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=it&amp;id=0OENAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq= ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'' (Volume XIV)], Modern Language Association of America, 1899. p. 488.

In it, Ferdinand claimed that his father was of Italian aristocracy. He describes Columbus to be a descendant of a Count Columbo of the Castle Cuccaro ([[Montferrat]]). Columbo was in turn said to be descended from a legendary Roman General Colonius. It is now widely believed that Christopher Columbus used this persona to ingratiate himself with the aristocracy, an elaborate illusion to mask a humble merchant background.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Robert; Elffers, Joost.

Retrieved 2011-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinand dismissed the fanciful story that the Admiral descended from the Colonus mentioned by Tacitus. However, he refers to "those two illustrious Coloni, his relatives."{{#tag:ref|In this regard, the eminent Spanish historian Antonio Ballesteros Beretta has written: "One person is responsible for the polemics about the birthplace of Christopher Columbus, and that person is his own son Ferdinand, who, in his biography of his father, displayed ignorance and doubts on a subject which, on the contrary, he should have known well. We must unhesitatingly point out that Don Ferdinand's work is rather tendentious and must be used with great caution. The problem of the Admiral's origin would not exist if Ferdinand had told the truth, which, instead, he deliberately concealed." "His dubious attitude" continues Ballesteros, "about the Discoverer's origins has given rise to an endless series of hypotheses, some of which are farfetched and fantastic. It is true that Ferdinand, in his father's biography, never ventures away from the Italian thesis, but he creates a great confusion. He tries to condition his readers, speaking of a noble family, from which his progenitor was presumably descended. He seeks it in Italy, and his attempts are aimed at creating a kind of nebula in which the splendour of an uncertain birth shines, and at the same time of a definite noble background. What is behind the father's silence and the confusion originated by the son?" Ballesteros has no hesitation in explaining: "We cannot blame Christopher or Ferdinand for having wanted to hide their origins. It was natural and human that Columbus, having reached great heights, at the side of the most powerful sovereigns of the earth, should conceal, with a claim of noble ancestry, his humble origins. Let us try to understand these human weaknesses and let us have compassion on his memory."&lt;ref name= "Paolo Emilio Taviani"/&gt;|group="nb"}} According to Note 1, on page 287, these two "were corsairs not related to each other or to Christopher Columbus, one being Guillame de Casenove, nicknamed Colombo, Admiral of France in the reign of Louis XI". At the top of page 4, Ferdinand listed [[Nervi]], [[Cogoleto]], [[Bogliasco]], Savona, Genoa and [[Piacenza]] (all inside the former [[Republic of Genoa]])&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The city of Piacenza was part of the [[Duchy of Milan]]; the Republic of Genoa was the latter's satellite.&lt;/ref&gt; as possible places of origin. He also stated:

{{quote|''Colombo'' ... was really the name of his ancestors. But he changed it in order to make it conform to the language of the country in which he came to reside and raise a new estate ...}}

In chapter ii, Ferdinand accuses [[Agostino Giustiniani]] of telling lies about the discoverer:

{{quote|Thus this Giustiniani proves himself to be an inaccurate historian and exposes himself as an inconsiderate or prejudiced and malicious ''compatriot'', because in writing about an exceptional person who brought so much honor to the country ...}}

In chapter v, he writes:

{{quote|And because it was not far from Lisbon, where he knew there were many Genoese ''his countrymen'', he went away thither as fast as he could ...}}

Ferdinand also says (chapter xi) that before he was declared admiral, his father used to sign himself "Columbus de Terra rubra," that is to say, Columbus of [[Terrarossa]], a village or hamlet near Genoa. In another passage, Ferdinand says that his father went to Lisbon and taught his brother [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartholomew]] to construct sea charts, globes and nautical instruments; and sent this brother to England to make proposals to Henry VII of his desired voyage. Finally, Ferdinand says incidentally (chapter lxxii) that Christopher's brother, Bartholomew Columbus named the new settlement [[Santo Domingo]] in memory of their father, Domenico.

The publication of ''Historie'' has been used by historians as providing indirect evidence about the Genoese origin of Columbus.

=== The testimony of the ambassadors ===

It is significant that no one protested at the court of Spain when in April 1501, in the feverish atmosphere of the great discovery, Nicolò Oderico, ambassador of the Genoese Republic, after praising the Catholic Sovereigns, went on to say that they "discovered with great expenditure hidden and inaccessible places under the command of Columbus, our fellow-citizen, and having tamed wild barbarians and unknown peoples, they educated them in religion, manners and laws". Furthermore, two diplomats from Venice — no great friend of Genoa, indeed, a jealous rival — added the appellation "Genoese" to Columbus's name: the first, Angelo Trevisan, in 1501,{{#tag:ref|Angelo Trevisan, chancellor and secretary to Domenico Pisano, the Venetian Republic's envoy to Spain, writing to Domenico Malipiero, member of Venice's Council of Predagi, notes that "I have succeeded in becoming a great friend of Columbus," and goes on to say: "Christoforo Colombo, Genoese, a tall, well-built man, ruddy, or great creative talent and with a long face."&lt;ref name= "Paolo Emilio Taviani"/&gt;|group="nb"}} the second, [[Gasparo Contarini]], in 1525.{{#tag:ref|Gasparo Contarini, Venice's ambassador to the courts of Spain and Portugal, reporting to the Senate of the [[Venetian Republic]] on 16 November 1525 on the whereabouts of the island of Hispaniola ([[Haiti]]), spoke of the Admiral who was living there.

Many contemporary writers agree that the discoverer was Genoese:&lt;ref name="Taviani 10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paolo Emilio Taviani"/&gt;

*The [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Rui de Pina]] wrote two works, ''Chronica d'El Rey, dom Affonso'' and ''Chronica d'El Rey, dom João II''. It has been ascertained that the manuscripts had been completed before 1504, although they were published in the Eighteenth century. Chapter 66 in the second manuscript, "Descubrimiento das Ilhas de Castella per Collombo," explicitly states, "Christovan Colombo italiano."
*In the 1513 edition of the ''Map of the New World'' from ''Ptolemy'',&lt;ref&gt;K. Kretschmer's atlas, ''Die Entdeckung Amerikas'', Berlin 1892, plate XII.&lt;/ref&gt; it says: "This land with the adjacent islands was discovered by the Genoese Columbus, sent by the King of Castile."
*The [[Turkish people|Turkish]] geographer Piri Ibn Haji Mehmed, known as [[Piri Reis]], in his map of 1513, writes: "These coasts are called the coasts of the Antilles. They were discovered in the year 896 of the Arabic calendar. It is said that a Genoese infidel, Columbus by name, discovered the place."{{#tag:ref|This [[Piri Reis map|map]] was drawn by Piri Reis, a Turkish cartographer and geographer, known as the nephew of [[Kemal Reis]], in [[Gelibolu]], in the month of muharrem of the year 919 (that is, between the 9th of March and the 7th of April of the year 1513). A large fragment of the map was found in 1929 during work to transform the [[Topkapı Palace]]. In 1501 the Turkish seamen engaged in a violent naval battle in the western Mediterranean. They captured a few Spanish cargo ships, in one of which they found various objects and products from America. Piri Reis writes thus in his ''Bahriye'': "On the enemy ships which was captured in the Mediterranean, we found a stone similar to jasper." It was on this occasion that the Turks came into possession of the map that Piri Reis used to trace the coastlines of America. According to the notes made on it, the map was constructed using several other maps as source material. There is no doubt as to its authenticity. In note 5 of the map, here is what Piri Reis tells us, in [[Ottoman Turkish language]]: « ... Amma şöyle rivayet ederler kim '''Cinevizden''' [from Genoa] bir '''kâfir''' [an infidel] adına '''Qolōnbō''' [named Columbus] derler imiş, bu yerleri ol bulmuştur ... »&lt;ref&gt;If the name had been "Colón", the author of the map would have translated this as '''Qolōn''' and would not have written '''Qolōnbō''' ("Colombo"). This spelling also indicates an Italian origin: when Columbus asked the permission for his voyages, at first his name was written as "Colomo" in the official documents, that, more or less relates to the [[apocope]] in Castilian for the Italian "Colombo". Only later his name was recorded as "Colón".&lt;/ref&gt; The note goes on to tell how Columbus proposed the enterprise "to the great men of Genoa" and how, on being rejected by them, he turned "to the king of Spain." It continues: "The deceased Gazi Kemal had a Spanish slave who told Kemal Reis he had been three times to that Land along with Columbus." The importance of the testimony on this Turkish map from a time close to that of the discovery lies in the source of the news it carries: a Spanish ship captured by the Turks in 1501. The document is wholly unconnected with contemporary Christian culture and completely autonomous from the above-mentioned references.|group="nb"}}

Actually, in the original text of Bernaldez, it says "land of Milan". However, this is merely lack of precision. In the 15th century, the [[Republic of Genoa]] was alternately fully and legally dependent on the [[Duchy of Milan]] and the latter's satellite. The editor rightly interpreted the Milanese reference in the sense of Genoese origin.

Columbus's Genoese birth is also confirmed by the works of the English Hakluyt (1601), of the Spaniard Antonio de Herrera (1612), the great Spanish dramatist Lope de Vega (1614), a paper manuscript dated 1626, conserved in Madrid's National Library, the works of the German Filioop Cluwer (1677), the German Giovanni Enrico Alsted (1649), the French Dionisio Petau (1724), and the Spaniard Luigi de Marmol (1667). This list represents the early writings of non-Italians. There were '''sixty-two Italian testimonies''' between 1502 and 1600.

[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], in his book ''Christopher Columbus: Admiral of the Ocean Sea'', notes that many existing legal documents demonstrate the Genoese origin of Columbus, his father Domenico, and his brothers Bartolomeo and Giacomo (Diego). These documents, written in Latin by notaries, were legally valid in Genoese courts. The documents, uncovered in the 19th century when Italian historians examined the Genoese archives, form part of the ''Raccolta Colombiana''. On page 14, Morison writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Besides these documents from which we may glean facts about Christopher's early life, there are others which identify the Discoverer as the son of Domenico the wool weaver, beyond the possibility of doubt. For instance, Domenico had a brother Antonio, like him a respectable member of the lower middle class in Genoa. Antonio had three sons: Matteo, Amigeto and Giovanni, who was generally known as Giannetto (the Genoese equivalent of "Johnny"). Giannetto, like Christopher, gave up a humdrum occupation to follow the sea. In 1496 the three brothers met in a notary's office at Genoa and agreed that Johnny should go to Spain and seek out his first cousin "Don Cristoforo de Colombo, Admiral of the King of Spain," each contributing one third of the traveling expenses. This quest for a job was highly successful. The Admiral gave Johnny command of a caravel on the Third Voyage to America, and entrusted him with confidential matters as well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;On the topic of Columbus' being born somewhere besides Genoa, Morison states "Every contemporary Spaniard or Portuguese who wrote about Columbus and his discoveries calls him Genoese. Four contemporary Genoese chroniclers claim him as a compatriot. Every early map on which his nationality is recorded describes him as Genoese or ''Ligur'', a citizen of the Ligurian Republic. Nobody in the Admiral's lifetime, or for three centuries after, had any doubt about his birthplace" and that "There is no more reason to doubt that Christopher Columbus was a Genoese-born Catholic Christian, steadfast in his faith and proud of his native city, than to doubt that [[George Washington]] was a Virginia-born Anglican of English race, proud of being an [[United States|American]]."

The position of Morison, is adopted by the British historian [[Felipe Fernández-Armesto]], who writes in his book:&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Armesto, Felipe.

The evidence of Columbus's origins in Genoa is overwhelming: almost no other figure of his class or designation has left so clear a paper trail in the archives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Paolo Emilio Taviani]], in his book ''Cristoforo Colombo: Genius of the Sea'' discusses "the public and notarial acts - original copies of which are conserved in the archives of Genoa and Savona - regarding Columbus's father, Columbus himself, his grandfather, and his relatives." In ''Columbus the Great Adventure'' he further claims that Columbus named the small island of [[Saona]] "to honor Michele da Cuneo, his friend from Savona."&lt;ref&gt;Taviani, Paolo Emilio.

Retrieved 2015-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence supporting the Genoese origin of Columbus is also discussed by [[Miles H. Davidson]]. In his book ''Columbus Then and Now: A Life Reexamined'', he writes:&lt;ref name="Miles H. Davidson"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Diego Méndez, one of his captains, in testimony given in the &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Pleitos&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, he said that Columbus was "Genoese, a native of Savona which is a town near Genoa." Those who reject this and the more than ample other contemporary evidence, given by both Italian and Spanish sources as well as by witnesses at these court hearings, are simply flying in the face of overwhelming evidence. [...] What is the reason behind so much futile speculation? It can be mostly attributed to parochialism. Each of the nations and cities mentioned wants to claim him for its own. Since no effort was made to locate the supporting data until the early nineteenth century, and since at that time not all of the archives had been adequately researched, there was, initially, justification for those early efforts to establish who he was and where he came from. To do so today is to fulfill Montaigne's maxim, "No one is exempt from talking non-sense; the misfortune is to do it solemnly."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Language ===

The spoken language of Genova and the Ligurian coast would primarily have been the [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian language]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/language/lij&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Italian language]] was originally based on the fourteenth century vernacular of [[Florence]] in the adjacent region of [[Tuscany]], and would not have been the main spoken language of Genova in the fifteenth century.

Although Columbus wrote almost exclusively in Spanish,{{#tag:ref|The oldest fragment of writing certainly attributable to Columbus is a marginal note in one of his books. De Lollis dates it around 1481. It is written in bad Spanish, mixed with Portuguese. All Columbus's letters, even those addressed to Genoese friends and to the Bank of Saint George, are written in Castilian.&lt;ref name="Paolo Emilio Taviani"/&gt;|group="nb"}} there is a small handwritten Genoese gloss in a 1498 Italian (from Venice) edition of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny's Natural History]]'' that he read after his second voyage to America: this shows Columbus was able to write in Genoese and read Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Milani, Virgil I. "''The written language of Christopher Columbus.''" State University of New York at Buffalo, 1973. Retrieved 2009-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a note in Italian in his own ''[[Book of Prophecies]]'' exhibiting, according to historian August Kling, "characteristics of northern Italian humanism in its calligraphy, syntax, and spelling".{{#tag:ref|De Lollis claims that Columbus wrote these notes in Italian because of his deep bitterness, at that time, against the Spanish court. Ballesteros advances a more logical theory, suggesting that this is the psychological reaction of an elderly man, nostalgic for his homeland. Surely Columbus would never have written in Italian if he had not been in such close touch with many compatriots, first in Portugal, then in Spain and finally during his voyages of discovery. It is generally accepted that he was on friendly terms with Genoese, Tuscans, Corsicans, Venetians and Neapolitans, and the point has been especially underlined by historians.&lt;ref name="Paolo Emilio Taviani"/&gt;|group="nb"}} Phillips and Phillips point out that 500 years ago, the [[Romance languages]] had not distanced themselves to the degree they have today. [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] in his ''Historia de las Indias'' claimed that Columbus did not know Spanish well and that he was not born in Castile.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} De las Casas, Bartolomé. "''Historia General de las Indias.''" (''Colección de Documentos Inéditos'') Madrid, 1875. Retrieved 2011-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valiant scholars have dedicated themselves to the subject of Christopher Columbus's language.{{#tag:ref|Chief among them are Menéndez Pidal, Arce, Caraci, Chiareno, Juan Gil, Milano, Consuelo Varela.&lt;ref name="Taviani 10"/&gt;|group="nb"}} They have conducted in-depth research both on the ship's log and on other writings of his that have come down to the modern day. They have analyzed the words, the terms, and the vocabulary, as well as rather frequent variations often bizarre in style, handwriting, grammar, and syntax. Christopher Columbus's language is Castilian punctuated by noteworthy and frequent Lusitanian, Italian, and Genoese influences and elements.&lt;ref name="Taviani 10"/&gt;

== Catalan hypothesis ==

Since the early 20th century, researchers have attempted to connect Columbus to the [[Catalan language|Catalan]]-speaking areas of [[Spain]], usually based on linguistic evidence. The first to propose a birthplace under the [[Crown of Aragon]] was [[Peru]]vian historian Luis Ulloa in a  book originally published in 1927 in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/u/ulloa_luis.htm|title=Luis Ulloa|language=Spanish|publisher=''Biografias y Vidas.com''|date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio Ballesteros Beretta, [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]] historian of America, said that Ulloa's "fiery imagination" had placed abstruse interpretations on court documents to support his thesis, had found no positive proof, and had dismissed as false any evidence supporting a Genoese origin.{{#tag:ref|"[Ulloa] penetrates the great labyrinth of Columbus court documents to gather arguments in favor of his preconceived theory. It is not possible to follow him in all of his lucubrations. His fiery imagination pushes him into a continuous hermeneutics. ... But what document, what proof, can be exhibited which affirms that Columbus was Catalonian? Absolutely none ... with the Catalonian thesis we are faced by a system of clues based essentially on a negative approach, which declares that anything which can prove that the discoverer was Genoese is false." Cited in &lt;ref name="Taviani 10"/&gt;}}

Throughout Columbus's life, he referred to himself as ''Christobal Colom''; his contemporaries and family also referred to him as such. It is possible that Colom is the shortened form of Columbus used for the Italian surname Colombo (which means "dove"). Colom can also be a Portuguese, French, or Catalan name, and in the latter means "dove". There was a wealthy mercenary and merchant noble named Joan Colom i Bertran living in [[Barcelona]] in the 15th century, who has been proposed as the real Christopher Columbus.

Some more recent studies also state Columbus had Catalan origins,&lt;ref&gt;Govan, Fiona.

Some researchers have postulated that Columbus was of [[Iberian Jews|Iberian Jewish]] origins. The linguist Estelle Irizarry, in addition to arguing that Columbus was Catalan, also claims that Columbus tried to conceal a Jewish heritage.&lt;ref&gt;http://medievalnews.blogspot.cz/2009/10/christopher-columbus-was-catalan-and.html&lt;/ref&gt; In "Three Sources of Textual Evidence of Columbus, Crypto Jew,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbspr.org/_kd/Items/actions.cfm?action=Show&amp;item_id=2026&amp; "Three Sources of Textual Evidence of Columbus, Crypto Jew."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017123715/http://www.tbspr.org/_kd/Items/actions.cfm?action=Show&amp;item_id=2026&amp; |date=2010-10-17 }} ''Tbspr.org.''

In a 1973 book, [[Simon Wiesenthal]] (1908–2005) postulated that Columbus was a [[Sephardi]] (Spanish Jew), careful to conceal his Judaism yet also eager to locate a place of refuge for his persecuted fellow countrymen. Wiesenthal argued that Columbus' concept of sailing west to reach the Indies was less the result of geographical theories than of his faith in certain Biblical texts—specifically the Book of Isaiah. He repeatedly cited two verses from that book: "Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them," (60:9); and "For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth" (65:17). Wiesenthal claimed that Columbus felt that his voyages had confirmed these prophecies.&lt;ref&gt;Wiesenthal, Simon.

Jane Francis Amler argued that Columbus was a ''[[converso]]'' (a Sephardi Jew who publicly converted to Christianity). In Spain, even some converted Jews were forced to leave Spain after much persecution; it is known that many ''conversos'' were still practicing [[Judaism]] in secret.

In a footnote to his translation of [[George Sand]]'s ''Un hiver à Majorque'', [[Robert Graves]] remarks: "There is strong historical evidence for supposing that Cristobal Colom (Christopher Columbus) was a Majorcan Jew; his surname is still common in the island." &lt;ref&gt;Sand, George, ''Winter in Majorca'', translated by Robert Graves, Valldemosa Edition, Mallorca, 1956, footnote to page 87&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek hypothesis ==

The theory that Columbus was a [[Byzantine Greek]] nobleman was first proposed in scholarly fashion in 1943 by Seraphim G. Canoutas, a Greek-American lawyer and independent scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Canoutas, Seraphim G., ''Christopher Columbus:  A Greek Nobleman,'' privately published (St. Marks Press, New York 1943). 
See also "Christopher Columbus Was a Greek Prince and His real Name Was Nikolaos Ypsilantis from the Greek Island of Chios" by Spyros Cateras, Manchester, New Hampshire, 1937.
 ''See also'' Durlacher-Wolper, Ruth G., ''The Identity of Christopher Columbus,'' privately published (New World Museum, San Salvador 1982), which relied on Canoutas’s work.&lt;/ref&gt;  The hypothesis rested mainly on statements attributed to Columbus by his son Ferdinand that Columbus had sailed for many years with Colombo the Younger, a famous seaman "of his name and family."&lt;ref&gt;"The first cause of the Admiral's coming to Spain and devoting himself to the sea was a renowned man of his name and family, called Colombo, who won great fame on the sea because he warred so fiercely against infidels and the enemies of his country that his name was used to frighten children in their cradles... He was called Colombo the Younger to distinguish him from another Colombo who in his time also won fame on the sea.... I return to my main theme.  While the Admiral was sailing in the company of the said Colombo the Younger (which he did for a long time)...." Keen, Benjamin (trans.), ''The Life of the Admiral Christopher Columbus by his Son Ferdinand'' (Rutgers Univ. Press, New Brunswick 1959), pp. 12-13.  Ferdinando's biography is found at:  [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k58802t/f2.image  Historie del S.D. Fernando Colombo] {{It icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Canoutas pointed out that other scholars (including Harrisse, Salvagnini, Vignaud, and Gonzales de la Rosa&lt;ref&gt;Canoutas cited:  Harrisse, Henry, ''Les Colombo de France et d’Italie'' (Paris 1872); Salvagnini, Alberto, "Cristoforo Colombo e i corsari Colombo," ''Commissione Colombiana:  Raccolta di documenti e studi pubblicati dalla R. Commissione Colombiana'' (Rome 1892-1896), Pt. II, vol. III; Vignaud, Henry, ''Études critiques sur la vie de Christophe Colomb avant ses découvertes'' (Paris 1905), pp. 129-189; and Gonzales de la Rosa, Manuel, ''La solution de tous les problèmes relatifs à l’origine et la vie de C. Colomb'' (Paris 1902), p. 19 (also in ''Proceedings of the International Congress of Americanists,'' Sess. 12 (1900), pp. 43-62).&lt;/ref&gt;) had convincingly identified Colombo the Younger as Georges Paléologue de Bissipat (also known as Georges le Grec), an exiled Byzantine nobleman who was living in France by 1460 and rendering valuable service to the French king. However, these scholars rejected Columbus’s claim of kinship with de Bissipat.

Accepting the kinship claim as true, Canoutas established (through references to works by Du Cange&lt;ref&gt;Du Cange, Charles du Fresne, ''Historia Byzantina duplici commentario illustrata'' (Paris 1680), Vol. 1 Familiae Byzantinae, Ch. XLII Familia Palaeologorum Bissipatorum, pp. 256-257.

Found at:  [https://archive.org/stream/memoires14soci#page/n9/mode/2up Les Bissipat du Beauvaisis] {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that Georges de Bissipat was in fact Georgios Palaiologos Dishypatos, scion of an ancient Byzantine noble family,&lt;ref&gt;''Cf.'' Entries for "Dishypatos," ''The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium,'' Vol. 1 (Oxford Univ. Press, New York &amp; Oxford 1991), pp. 638-639.&lt;/ref&gt; who fled to France sometime after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and, until his death in 1496, rendered important service to French kings Louis XI (1423–1483) and Charles VIII (1470–1498), including as vice-admiral.  According to Canoutas, accepting that Dishypatos and Columbus were noble kinsmen and longtime sailing companions helped explain many anomalies that had to be ignored, or attributed to error or imposture in order to reconcile the accepted account of Columbus's early life as a wool-worker's son with his later life as a nobleman and Admiral.

Canoutas did not identify Columbus’s parents or place of birth, nor did he analyze Columbus’s claimed kinship bond with Dishypatos. However, Canoutas observed that the Byzantine imperial house of [[Palaiologos]], to which Dishypatos was related on his mother’s side, was closely connected by blood or marriage to the ruling families of Italy, including those of Genoa and Montferrat, such as the Doria, Spinola, Centurione, and Gattelusio families.&lt;ref&gt;''Cf.'' Entry for "Palaiologos," ''The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium,'' Vol. 3 (Oxford Univ. Press, New York &amp; Oxford 1991), pp. 1557-1560.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[Palaiologos]] family were the [[rulers of Montferrat]] for more than 200 years. This connection, he argued, might explain why Columbus’s contemporaries and others considered him to be Genoese or Ligurian.&lt;ref&gt;Canoutas, ''op cit.'' pp. 68, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another book written on his Greek origins is called "Christopher Columbus Was a Greek Prince and His real Name Was Nikolaos Ypsilantis from the Greek Island of Chios" by Spyros Cateras, New Hampshire, 1937. There is also a section in "The Secret Destiny of America" by Manly P. Hall, New York, 1944. pp 62–63.

== Portuguese hypothesis ==
[[File:CristovaoColomboCuba.JPG|thumb|180px|A statue of Columbus in [[Cuba, Portugal|Cuba]], a town in Southern Portugal.]]
The first author who claimed Portuguese nationality for Christopher Columbus was Patrocínio Ribeiro in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} Ribeiro, Patrocínio. "''O Carácter Misterioso de Colombo e o Problema da sua Nacionalidade.''" Coimbra, 1916. Retrieved 2011-11-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The same text with some additions was again published in 1927, after his death, with a complementary study by the medical doctor Barbosa Soeiro relating Columbus' signature with the [[Kabbalah]].

In 1988 José Mascarenhas Barreto published a book&lt;ref&gt;Barreto, Mascarenhas.

Retrieved 2008-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt; which claims that Columbus was a Portuguese national and spy who hatched up an elaborate diversion to keep the Spanish from the lucrative trade routes that were opening up around Africa to the Indies. Barreto, through his interpretation of the Kabbalah and other research, suggested Columbus was born in [[Cuba Municipality|Cuba, Portugal]], the son of a nobleman and related to other Portuguese navigators. According to this claim, his real name was concealed, Christopher Columbus being a pseudonym, meaning Bearer of Christ and the Holy Spirit. His real name was supposedly Salvador Fernandes Zarco and he was the son of Dom Fernando, Duke of [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja, Alentejo]] and maternal grandson of [[João Gonçalves Zarco]], discoverer of Madeira. Mascarenhas Barreto, however, has been discredited by Portuguese genealogist Luís Paulo Manuel de Meneses de Melo Vaz de São Paio in his works ''Carta Aberta a um Agente Secreto, Primeira Carta Aberta a Mascarenhas Barreto''&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} "Armas e Troféus."

This theory was popularized among the Portuguese public by the 2005 novel ''Codex 632'', a best-seller written by [[José Rodrigues dos Santos]].

== Polish hypothesis ==
Writing in ''[[The Polish Review]]'', Krystyna Lukasiewicz commented on rumours that King [[Władysław III of Poland]] did not die in 1444 but hid on the island of Madeira:&lt;ref name="Lukasiewicz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lukasiewicz|first1=Krystyna|title=Deceptive Practices in Fifteenth Century Europe: The Case of Wladyslaw III Jagiellon (Varnensis)|journal=The Polish Review|date=2012|volume=47|issue=2|pages=3–20|jstor=41558078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Beginning in all probability around the time of Henrique [Alemão{{#tag:ref|Henrique Alemão was "a [[Order of Saint Catherine of Mount Sinai|knight of St. Catherine]] who died on Madeira in 1472".&lt;ref name="Lukasiewicz"/&gt;|group="nb"}}]'s death, such rumors were for the first time recorded in the early eighteenth century.

== Other hypotheses ==

===Sardinia===
The [[Spain|Spanish]] historian Marisa Azuara has hypothesized that Columbus could be a [[Sardinian people|Sardinian]] noble from the town of [[Sanluri]], called ''Christòval Colòn'': she claimed that he was son of Salvatore of Siena and Alagon and Isabella Alagon of Arborea, related to [[Pope Pius II]]. At the time of his birth, the island of [[Sardinia]] was partially under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] economic and political rule, until it was conquered at the end of 15th century by the [[Kingdom of Aragon]].

Christòval Colòn would be born in 1436 and he spent his youth studying nautical science, and he spoke both Italian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Marisa Azuara, Cristoforo Colombo, la Crociata Universale, Barracoa, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corsica===
In [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]], a town on the north coast of [[Corsica]], [[France]], which used to be part of the Genoese Empire, one can see the ruins of a house that locals believe to be Columbus' birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Corsica 'discovers' Columbus birthplace |newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |date=October 18, 1934 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1787&amp;dat=19341018&amp;id=2oQcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Q2QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6858,1311618 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Calvi, Corsica: My kind of town |first=Martin |last=Buckley |work=[[The Daily Telegraph#Website|The Telegraph]] |date=September 12, 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/france/2823767/Calvi-Corsica-My-kind-of-town.html |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
Norwegians Svein Grodys and writer Tor Borch Sannes have investigated the anecdote that Columbus was born in [[Nordfjord]], [[Norway]]. In his 1991 book ''Christopher Columbus – en europeer fra Norge'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13488360.html&lt;/ref&gt; Borch Sannes highlights [[Ferdinand Columbus]]' claim that the name ''Colonus'' (farmer) was a translation of a foreign name.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In translations of Columbus' text, this claim does not appear to refer to ''Colonus'' but to ''Colón'', which Ferdinand Columbus connects to the Greek word ''κῶλον'', with the meaning ''member''. See Guzuskyte E., Christopher Columbus's Naming in the 'diarios' of the Four Voyages, p. 205, and Colon F., Keen B., The Life of the Admiral Christopher Columbus&lt;/ref&gt; Sannes points out that if Columbus were of Scandinavian descent, ''Colonus'' would be derived from ''Bonde'', as in the [[Bonde|House of Bonde]]. He points out that the [[coat of arms]] of both Columbus and the royal [[Bonde]] lineage of [[Sweden]] were similar and at the time used a [[bend (heraldry)|bend]]. More specifically, Borch Sannes claims that Iohannes Colon, the grandfather of Christopher Columbus, was one Johannes Bonde, the grandson of [[Tord Bonde]] and thus a first cousin of King [[Charles VIII of Sweden]]/Charles I of Norway (whose name was Karl Knudsson Bonde), and a second cousin of [[Erik Johansson Vasa]]. Borch Sannes further points out that two of Columbus' father's neighbours had the name ''Bondi''. Columbus also had close acquaintances called ''Galli'', almost the name of another important Norwegian noble family at the time, ''Galle'',&lt;ref&gt;https://snl.no/Galle%2Fnorsk_adelsslekt&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''Scotto'', a name Sannes speculates could be Scottish-Norwegian (in the original form ''Schytte'', meaning "Scot"). According to Borch Sannes, the Bonde lineage originally had its seat in [[Hyen]], Nordfjord, but disappeared from Nordfjord with the [[Black Death]]. Based on what he admits is circumstantial evidence, Borch Sannes nevertheless outlines a scenario in which Columbus could have been born in Nordfjord. Sannes' book also claims that Columbus may have visited [[Devon Island]] in 1477, based on Columbus' description of the [[73rd parallel north]].&lt;ref&gt;Borch Sannes, Tor. "''Christopher Columbus: en europeer fra Norge?''" Norsk maritimt forlag, 1991. Retrieved 2006-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers have highlighted Columbus' links to the Justiniani family of Genova, pointing out that the Genovese Paulus Justiniani was the bishop of Bergen from 1457-60.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juv.no/files/grodys.html&lt;/ref&gt; A monument to Columbus has been raised in Hyen.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.sklbb.no/melheim/bg-trheim.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Dominica:

'''[[Dominica]]'''  &amp;ndash; [[List of sovereign states|sovereign]] [[island nation]] located in the [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 3, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/do.html|title=Dominica|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Latin]], its name means "Sunday", which was the day on which it was discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]].  Dominica's [[pre-Columbian]] name was ''Wai'tu kubuli'', which means "Tall is her body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominica.dm/site/dominica.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923082054/http://dominica.dm/site/dominica.cfm |archivedate=2010-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Carib Territory]] was established for the indigenous people of the island. Because the island lies between two French [[Département d'outre-mer|overseas departments]], [[Guadeloupe]] to the north and [[Martinique]] to the south, and because it was colonized by France for a time, it is sometimes called "French Dominica". However, its official language is [[English language|English]], though a [[Antillean Creole|French creole]] is commonly spoken.  Dominica has been [[nickname]]d the "Nature Isle of the Caribbean" for its largely unspoiled natural environment. It is one of the youngest islands in the [[Lesser Antilles]], still being formed by [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal]]-[[volcano|volcanic]] activity, as evidenced by the world's second-largest [[boiling lake]]. The island features lush [[mountain]]ous [[rainforests]], home of many very rare plant, animal, and bird species. There are [[xeric]] areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy rainfall can be expected inland.  The [[Imperial amazon|sisserou parrot]], the island's national bird, is featured on the [[Flag of Dominica|national flag]]. Dominica's economy is heavily dependent on both tourism and agriculture.

'''Pico Turquino''' is the [[List of countries by highest point|highest point]] in [[Cuba]]. It is located in the southeast part of the island, in the [[Sierra Maestra]] [[mountain range]] in the municipality of [[Guamá, Cuba|Guamá]], [[Santiago de Cuba Province]].

==Overview==
The name is believed to be a corruption of [[turquoise]] ({{lang-es|turquesa}}) peak, named so for the blue hues taken by the heights in certain views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emba.cubaminrex.cu/Default.aspx?tabid=8427|title=Pico Turquino, la montaña azul o el monte de los turcos|author=Cuban Foreign Ministry|accessdate=2007-10-18|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002065531/http://emba.cubaminrex.cu/Default.aspx?tabid=8427|archivedate=2011-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first mentioned (under the name "Tarquino") on a map drawn by Gerardo Kramer in the late 18th century. It was first climbed in 1860 by F.W. Ramsden. [https://archive.org/stream/jstor-40590919/40590919_djvu.txt]

A bust of [[José Martí]], sculpted by [[Jilma Madera]], was placed on the peak to celebrate his centenary.

'''Piers Macleod Blaikie'''  (born 29 January 1942)   is a geographer and scholar of international development and natural resources, who worked until 2003 at the [[School of International Development|School of Development Studies]], [[University of East Anglia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150527210155/https://www.uea.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.153302!blaikiecv.pdf "CURRICULUM VITAE FOR PIERS MACLEOD BLAIKIE"], ''University of East Anglia''. Retrieved on May 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His contribution to development has been in four areas: 
* [[Environmental policy|Environment]]
* Agrarian Change
* AIDS and [[family planning]]
* [[political ecology]]

==Background==
Blaikie was born in wartime Scotland, in Helensburgh. He was educated at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], where he read the [[Department of Geography, University of Cambridge|Geography]] [[Tripos]] (1964) and completed a PhD (1971). He lectured in geography at the [[University of Reading]] from 1968 to 1972, before spending 33 years at the [[University of East Anglia]], in the School of Development Studies, where he eventually became Professor. He retired in 2003 but has remained professionally active.

==Major contributions==

Of all his work his best known is the small volume published in 1985 ''Political Economy of Soil Erosion in Developing Countries''.&lt;ref&gt;Piers Blaikie. (1985) ''The Political Economy of Soil Erosion in Developing Countries''. Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, and elsewhere, he argues that [[soil erosion]] should not only, or even mainly, be thought of as being the result of mismanagement, [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] or for environmental reasons but can often be due to the effects of [[political economy]] on poor farmers. His earliest work was based on the case of Nepal, where the marginalisation of peasant farmers onto steep slopes has resulted in erosion. Blaikie writes "A principal conclusion of this book is that soil erosion in lesser developed countries will not be substantially reduced unless it seriously threatens the accumulation possibilities of the dominant classes" (p147).&lt;ref&gt;David Simon (ed) (2006) Fifty Key Thinkers in Development, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Blaikie's legacy from this book was the beginnings of regional [[political ecology]], a particular approach to understanding the economic and political drivers of resource degradation and particularly the lack of access to natural resources suffered by poor or marginalised people. In ''Land Degradation and Society'' (1987) the approach received further development. Blaikie regards an environmental problem as rooted in processes operating at different nested scales, moving from the local to the [[international political economy]]. The job of the political ecologist is to work out how these scaled factors interrelate.&lt;ref&gt;Piers Blaikie &amp; Harold Brookfield (1987)''Land Degradation and Society''. Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''AIDS in Africa'' Blaikie and UEA colleague Tony Barnett applied the approach to understanding the contemporary AIDS crisis in Africa, based on substantial fieldwork in East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Piers Blaikie and Anthony Barnett (1992) ''AIDS in Africa''  Belhaven Press, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of ''At Risk'' (1994) applied the approach once again to a range of so-called 'natural' disasters, which were found to be significantly magnified by inequality and capitalist greed, leaving affected people in a 'reproduction squeeze'. This they called the 'pressure-release model',&lt;ref&gt;[https://ds.lclark.edu/sge/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2012/06/PAR-diagram.gif "The Pressure and Release Model"], Blaikie 1994. Retrieved on May 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; where root causes – power, structures, resources, political systems, economic systems lie behind disaster pressures – e.g. lack of local institutions, rapid urbanisation. These lead to unsafe conditions – physical environment, local economy, vulnerability, public actions. On the physical side of the equation is a natural hazard. Risk=hazard+vulnerability.

By this stage in the 1990s, [[political ecology]] had 'arrived' as a framework in the social sciences, and critiques began to be heard concerning the rigidities of some aspects of the framework. ''At Risk'' was rewritten and reissued in 2004, responding to these criticisms&lt;ref&gt;Ben Wisner, Piers Blaikie, Terry Cannon and Ian Davis (2004) At ''Risk: Natural Hazards, People’s Vulnerability and Disasters''. London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2723">'''Pilikambi Rural LLG''' is one of the four [[Districts and LLGs of Papua New Guinea|Local-Level Government Areas]] (LLGs) of [[Lagaip-Porgera Electorate|Lagaip Porgera Electorate]] in [[Enga Province]], [[Papua New Guinea]]. The other three LLGs in the district  are Maip-Mulitaka Rural, Paiela-Hewa Rural and Porgera.

The name PiliKambi is extracted from two main tribes along the Lagaip River. They are Apulin (Pili-Apul which means rain) and Sambe (Kambi which refers to the Eagle, born out of an Eagle.)

The Pilikambi LLG has one President, 19 Village Councillors and 2 appointed women reps. The main Pilikambi government station and council chamber is in Kepelam Village. Kepelam village is owned by both Sambe and Apulin tribes and is looked after by its traditional Chief Akem.

Pilikambi Sub District is the home to ''Lake Lau'', the Mighty ''Lagaip river'' (head of Strickland and Fly), ''Aipiandak salt Lake'', ''Mt Sugarloaf'', and many great rivers like Sepik and Purari originates from the ''Yopos Plateau'' near Lake Lau. Tee or Moka is common amongst the Pilikambi people. 
 
Some of Papua New Guineas greatest leaders originates from Pilikambi. These include  Sir Tei Abal, First Opposition Leader, his son Samuel Tei Abal, Paul Paken Torato, Kundapen Kelvin Talyaga and the Current Governor of Enga Grand Chief Peter Ipatas. Ipatas and Talyaga hails from Apulin tribes whilst Abals and Torato come from the Sambe tribe. Magically Abals and Torato comes from the same sub-clan of Temaga Tiagan of Yaingel Valley. Both led the United Party as Leaders. 
 
Pilikambi is the most disadvantaged sub district in Papua New Guinea in terms of Economic sustainability. They hardly have any cash crops and income source.

Health, Education, and infrastructural services are general run down. They only have the Catholic run St. Christopher  Sub Health Centre at Kepelam followed by the government run Yango Sub district Health Centre supported by Kupitu, Pokeras and a number of Aid Posts.  Pilikambi High School and a number of Primary schools and many Elementary School are there but the operations are affected mainly by the road conditions and tribal fights. The newly built Lii Road cross cutting from Wabag-Kepelam-Kandep is only accessed by Four Wheel Drives.
 
In the west of the Sub District headquarters lies the Lake Lau. A guide is recommended but you would find the friendly Andati, Tanzen, Sikita, Kaiti, Talyulu, Epoko and Tiagan clansmen People. 

Pilikambi is mainly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] followed by [[Lutherans]], Christian Apostolic Fellowship, SDA and other [[Pentecostal Churches of Christ|Pentecostal churches]].

'''Sedimentology''' encompasses the study of modern [[sediment]]s such as [[sand]],&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Siever, ''Sand'', Scientific American Library, New York (1988), {{ISBN|0-7167-5021-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[silt]], and [[clay]],&lt;ref&gt;Georges Millot, translated [from the French] by W.R. Farrand, Helene Paquet, ''Geology Of Clays - Weathering, Sedimentology, Geochemistry'' Springer Verlag, Berlin (1970), {{ISBN|0-412-10050-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the processes that result in their formation ([[erosion]] and [[weathering]]), [[Transportation (sediment)|transport]], [[Deposition (geology) | deposition]] and [[diagenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Nichols, ''Sedimentology &amp; Stratigraphy'', Wiley-Blackwell, Malden, MA (1999), {{ISBN|0-632-03578-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sedimentologists apply their understanding of modern processes to interpret geologic history through observations of [[sedimentary rocks]] and [[sedimentary structures]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Prothero and Fred Schwab, '' Sedimentary Geology: An Introduction to Sedimentary Rocks and Stratigraphy'', W. H. Freeman (1996), {{ISBN|0-7167-2726-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedimentary rocks cover up to 75% of the [[Earth]]'s surface, record much of the [[History of Earth|Earth's history]], and harbor the [[fossil record]]. Sedimentology is closely linked to [[stratigraphy]], the study of the physical and temporal relationships between rock layers or [[stratum|strata]].

The [[Uniformitarianism | premise]] that the processes affecting the earth today are the same as in the past is the basis for determining how sedimentary features in the rock record were formed. By comparing similar features today to features in the rock record—for example, by comparing modern [[sand dune]]s to dunes preserved in ancient [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] sandstones—geologists reconstruct past environments.

==Sedimentary rock types==
[[Image:Triassic Utah.JPG|thumb|right|Middle [[Triassic]] marginal marine sequence of siltstones and sandstones, southwestern [[Utah]].]]
There are four primary types of [[sedimentary rocks]]: clastics, carbonates, evaporites, and chemical.
* [[Clastic rocks]] are composed of particles derived from the [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] of precursor rocks and consist primarily of fragmental material. Clastic rocks are classified according to their predominant [[Particle size|grain size]] and their composition.  In the past, the term "Clastic Sedimentary Rocks" were used to describe silica-rich clastic sedimentary rocks, however there have been cases of clastic carbonate rocks. The more appropriate term is [[siliciclastic]] sedimentary rocks.
** Organic sedimentary rocks are important deposits formed from the accumulation of biological detritus, and form [[coal]] and [[oil shale]] deposits, and are typically found within [[Depression (geology)|basins]] of clastic sedimentary rocks
* [[Carbonate rocks|Carbonates]] are composed of various [[carbonate minerals]] (most often [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)) precipitated by a variety of organic and inorganic processes. Typically, the majority of carbonate rocks are composed of [[reef]] material {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}.
* [[Evaporite]]s are formed through the evaporation of water at the Earth's surface and most commonly include [[halite]] or [[gypsum]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Tarbuck, Frederick K. Lutgens, Cameron J. Tsujita, ''Earth, An Introduction to Physical Geology'', National Library of Canada Cataloguing in Publication, 2005, {{ISBN|0-13-121724-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chemical sedimentary rocks, including some carbonates, are deposited by precipitation of minerals from aqueous solution. These include [[jaspilite]] and [[chert]].

==Importance of sedimentary rocks==
[[File:UraniumMineUtah.JPG|thumb|[[Charles Steen#Mi Vida|Mi Vida uranium mine]] in [[redox]] mudstones near [[Moab, Utah]]]]
Sedimentary rocks provide a multitude of products which modern and ancient society has come to utilise.
* [[Art]]: [[marble]], although a [[metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] [[limestone]], is an example of the use of sedimentary rocks in the pursuit of aesthetics and art
* Architectural uses: stone derived from sedimentary rocks is used for [[dimension stone]] and in [[architecture]], notably [[slate]], a meta-[[shale]], for [[Roofing material|roofing]], [[sandstone]] for load-bearing [[buttress]]es
* [[Ceramic]]s and industrial materials: [[clay]] for [[pottery]] and [[ceramic]]s including [[brick]]s; [[cement]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]] derived from [[limestone]].
* [[Economic geology]]: sedimentary rocks host large deposits of [[Sedimentary exhalative deposits|SEDEX]] ore deposits of [[lead]]-[[zinc]]-[[silver]], large deposits of [[copper]], deposits of [[gold]], [[tungsten]], [[Uranium]], and many other precious minerals, [[gemstones]] and industrial minerals including [[heavy mineral sands ore deposits]]
* Energy: [[petroleum geology]] relies on the capacity of sedimentary rocks to generate deposits of [[petroleum]] [[oil]]s. [[Coal]] and [[oil shale]] are found in sedimentary rocks. A large proportion of the world's [[uranium]] energy resources are hosted within sedimentary successions.
* [[Groundwater]]: sedimentary rocks contain a large proportion of the Earth's groundwater [[aquifer]]s. Our understanding of the extent of these aquifers and how much water can be withdrawn from them depends critically on our knowledge of the rocks that hold them (the reservoir).

== Basic principles ==
[[Image:HeavyMineralsBeachSand.jpg|thumb|right|Heavy minerals (dark) deposited in a [[quartz]] beach [[sand]] ([[Chennai]], India).]]
The aim of sedimentology, studying sediments, is to derive information on the depositional conditions which acted to deposit the rock unit, and the relation of the individual rock units in a basin into a coherent understanding of the evolution of the sedimentary sequences and basins, and thus, the Earth's geological history as a whole.

The scientific basis of this is the principle of uniformitarianism, which states that the sediments within ancient sedimentary rocks were deposited in the same way as sediments which are being deposited at the Earth's surface today.

Sedimentological conditions are recorded within the sediments as they are laid down; the form of the sediments at present reflects the events of the past and all events which affect the sediments, from the source of the sedimentary material to the stresses enacted upon them after [[diagenesis]] are available for study.

The [[Law of superposition|principle of superposition]] is critical to the interpretation of sedimentary sequences, and in older metamorphic terrains or fold and thrust belts where sediments are often intensely [[fold (geology)|folded]] or deformed, recognising [[younging]] indicators or [[graded bedding]] is critical to interpretation of the sedimentary section and often the deformation and metamorphic structure of the region.

Folding in sediments is analysed with the [[principle of original horizontality]], which states that sediments are deposited at their angle of repose which, for most types of sediment, is essentially horizontal. Thus, when the younging direction is known, the rocks can be "unfolded" and interpreted according to the contained sedimentary information.

The [[principle of lateral continuity]] states that layers of sediment initially extend laterally in all directions unless obstructed by a physical object or topography.

The [[principle of cross-cutting relationships]] states that whatever cuts across or intrudes into the layers of strata is younger than the layers of strata.

== Methodology ==
[[Image:MudcracksCentripetal.JPG|thumb|Centripetal desiccation cracks (with a [[dinosaur]] footprint in the center) in the Lower [[Jurassic]] Moenave Formation at the St. George Dinosaur Discovery Site at Johnson Farm, southwestern Utah.]]
The methods employed by sedimentologists to gather data and evidence on the nature and depositional conditions of sedimentary rocks include;
* Measuring and describing the outcrop and distribution of the rock unit;
** Describing the [[rock formation]], a formal process of documenting thickness, lithology, outcrop, distribution, contact relationships to other formations
** Mapping the distribution of the rock unit, or units
* Descriptions of rock core (drilled and extracted from wells during hydrocarbon exploration)
* [[Sequence stratigraphy]]
** Describes the progression of rock units within a basin
* Describing the [[lithology]] of the rock;
** [[Petrology]] and [[petrography]]; particularly measurement of [[rock microstructure|texture]], [[Particle size|grain size]], grain shape (sphericity, rounding, etc.), sorting and composition of the sediment
* Analysing the [[geochemistry]] of the rock
** [[Isotope geochemistry]], including use of [[radiometric dating]], to determine the age of the rock, and its affinity to source regions

== Recent developments ==

The longstanding understanding of how some [[mudstone]]s form has been challenged by geologists at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. The research, which appears in the December 14th, 2007, edition of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', counters the prevailing view of geologists that mud only settles when water is slow-moving or still, instead showing that "muds will accumulate even when currents move swiftly." The research shows that some mudstones may have formed in fast-moving waters: "Mudstones can be deposited under more energetic conditions than widely assumed, requiring a reappraisal of many geologic records."&lt;ref&gt;Juergen Schieber, John Southard, and Kevin Thaisen, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5857/1760 "Accretion of Mudstone Beds from Migrating Floccule Ripples,"] ''Science'', 14 December 2007: 1760-1763.&lt;br /&gt;See also [http://www.physorg.com/news116777974.html "As waters clear, scientists seek to end a muddy debate,"] at ''[[PhysOrg.com]]'' (accessed 27 December 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Macquaker and Bohacs, in reviewing the research of Schieber et al., state that "these results call for critical reappraisal of all mudstones previously interpreted as having been continuously deposited under still waters. Such rocks are widely used to infer past climates, ocean conditions, and orbital variations."&lt;ref&gt;Joe H. S. Macquaker and Kevin M. Bohacs, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5857/1734 "Geology: On the Accumulation of Mud,"] ''Science'', 14 December 2007: 1734-1735.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable recent research into [[mudstone]]s has been driven by the recent effort to commercially produce hydrocarbons from them, in both the [[Shale gas]] and [[Tight Oil]] (or Light Tight Oil) plays.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G.

A '''spatiomap''' is document similar to a [[map]], but based on an [[orthophoto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gis.vsb.cz/GIS_Ostrava/GIS_Ova_2010/sbornik/Lists/Papers/EN_8_1.pdf SPATIOMAP generation from SPOT 5 super mode images ], GIS Ostrava 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Often, some annotations are added to the orthophoto. Similar to normal maps, can display a [[north arrow]], a [[scale bar]] and cartographical information like the used [[map projection|projection]]. Spatiomaps are useful when other reliable source are missing for a certain area and/or when a map must be produced in very short time (e.g. for [[disaster management]]). Spatiomaps are frequently used during [[disaster relief]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.disasterscharter.org/web/guest/-/floods-in-roman-8 Different examples of spatiomaps], ''International Charter Space &amp; Major Disasters'': Floods in Romania (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.fao.org/ref/f797b8f0-88fd-11da-a88f-000d939bc5d8.html?version=1.0 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. FAO GEONETWORK. Crisis spatio-map ( Banda Aceh - Lho Nga area). (Latest update:  post disaster 2.5 m SPOT 5 data (30/12/04)) Accessed (GeoLayer). URI: 04 Jun 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

An image map or [[orthophotomap]] is a similar document, but is mostly regarded as an orthophotomosaic with some points, lines or polygon layers of a traditional map drawn over the [[orthophoto]]. An image map resembles a standard general purpose map but adds the use of an orthophotomosaic as a background.

The '''Street Naming Committee''' was set up to decide the names of the streets, the squares and the river of the new settlement of [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], as it had been laid out by Colonel [[William Light]] in 1837. Light's map corresponds to the modern [[Adelaide city centre]] and [[North Adelaide]]. The committee met on 23 May 1837.

With a very few exceptions, the original names have been retained, although a large number of streets have since been added, particularly in the city centre. Brown Street and Hanson Street have been subsumed into [[Morphett Street, Adelaide|Morphett Street]] and [[Pulteney Street, Adelaide|Pulteney Street]] respectively. Roberts Place has been renamed Sir Edwin Smith Avenue.

The names are of prominent pioneers or people who otherwise made some notable contribution to the founding of South Australia, many of whom never actually visited or lived in the colony. Some exceptions are due to Governor Hindmarsh and Judge Jeffcott wishing to name streets after their friends. [[Strangways Terrace]] was named after [[Thomas Bewes Strangways]], a committee member who was also a prospective son-in-law to the Governor. [[Pulteney Street, Adelaide|Pulteney Street]] was named after Admiral Sir [[Pulteney Malcolm]] who had recommended that Hindmarsh be appointed first Governor of the colony.  More controversially, Archer Street was to have been named Willoughby Street, after Sir Henry Willoughby, a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[member of parliament|MP]] who had initially opposed the South Australia Bill, but was later won over and convinced others also to change their votes. Through the Governor's interference, the name was changed to Archer, after a landowner who had given him some sheep. O'Connell Street and Kermode Street were named after Jeffcott's friends [[Daniel O'Connell]], who had defended him over a duel, and [[Robert Kermode]], the brother of his fiancée.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kermode, Robert Quayle (1812–1870)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kermode-robert-quayle-2832|website=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=22 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Burren''' ({{Irish place name|Boireann|great rock}}) is a region of environmental interest primarily located in northwestern [[County Clare]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], dominated by glaciated [[karst]] (or sometimes [[glaciokarst]]&lt;ref name="BurrenNP_Geol"&gt;[https://www.burrennationalpark.ie/geology] Burren National Park - Geology - "The Burren is one of the finest examples of a Glacio-Karst landscape in the world. At least two glacial advances are known in the Burren area."&lt;/ref&gt;) landscape.  It measures, depending on the definition, between {{convert|250|km2|mi2}} and {{convert|560|km2|mi2}}. The name is most often applied to the area within the circle made by the villages of [[Tubber, County Clare|Tubber]], [[Corofin, County Clare|Corofin]], [[Kilfenora]], [[Lisdoonvarna]], and [[Ballyvaughan]], and [[Kinvara]] in extreme south-western Galway, including the adjacent coastline.&lt;ref name="GeoParkGuide"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Burren Visitor Guide|url=http://www.burrengeopark.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Burren-Free-Visitor-Guide.pdf|website=Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A part of the Burren forms the '''Burren National Park''', the smallest of the six [[National Parks in the Republic of Ireland|National Parks]] in Ireland, while the full Burren and adjacent territory including the [[Cliffs of Moher]] are included in the [[Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark]].

==Location==
While the name is generally applied to the limestone uplands of northwestern Clare, and adjacent lowlands, and generally excludes the area of ''Clare shales'' to the southwest, the exact extent of the area is not clearly defined, and geologically it does extend into [[County Galway]] to both the north and northeast (see ''Geology'' below). The southeastern pocket of Co. Galway around Kinvara is usually included, and is the base for many Burren organisations. 
The Burren is certainly bounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and by [[Galway Bay]], with the [[Aran Islands]] representing a geological extension of the limestone hills that make up most of The Burren.&lt;ref name="Explore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=George|title=Exploring the Burren|publisher=Town House and Country House, Dublin|year=1998|isbn=0-946172-59-5|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

According to one definition, the Burren extends south to a line from the coastal resort of [[Lahinch]] to Corofin and is delimited in the east by a line roughly from Kinvara to [[Kilmacduagh monastery]], near [[Gort]]. Note that taken literally, this would includes places like the town of [[Ennistymon]] and the [[Cliffs of Moher]], which would more commonly be considered as neighbouring the Burren.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|5}}  In another definition, the "Burren Programme" defines the region as extending well into the Gort plain, encompassing inter alia [[Coole Park]] and the [[Turlough (lake)|turloughs]] around it, while to the south it would extend to [[Ruan, County Clare|Ruan]] and [[Crusheen]], and in the southwest to the edge of [[Doolin]], as well as the routine Lisdoonvarna, Kilfenora and Corofin.&lt;ref name="BP"/&gt;

Thus the stated size of the Burren varies between around {{convert|250|km2|mi2}} (the core area of exposed limestone), through {{convert|360|km2|mi2}} (taking in all limestone landscapes) and 560 square kilometers (including the about {{convert|200|km2|mi2}} of downland), depending on the approach taken. Roughly 60% of the uplands show exposed limestone pavement.&lt;ref name="NPH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burrennationalpark.ie/history|title=Burren National Park History|publisher=National Parks and Wildlife Service|date=|first=|last=|accessdate=28 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930092125/http://www.burrennationalpark.ie/history|archivedate=30 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|5,16,33}}

==Climate==
The Burren has an unusually temperate climate for western Ireland. Average air temperatures range from 15&amp;nbsp;°C in July to 4-6&amp;nbsp;°C in January, while the soil temperature does not usually drop below 6&amp;nbsp;°C (as an exception, in late 2010, there was a prolonged period of snow). Since grass will grow once the temperature rises above 6&amp;nbsp;°C, this means that The Burren (like the neighbouring Aran Islands) has one of the longest growing seasons in Ireland or Britain, and supports diverse and rich plant growth.&lt;ref name="EFNCPclimate"&gt;European Forum on Nature Conservatism and Pastoralism: [http://www.efncp.org/hnv-showcases/ireland-the-burren/the-burren/facts/ The Burren - Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125015321/http://www.efncp.org/hnv-showcases/ireland-the-burren/the-burren/facts/ |date=2018-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area has around {{convert|1525|mm|in}} of annual rainfall (more than twice the amount observed in eastern Ireland),&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|33}} with an average level of over {{convert|160|mm|in}} monthly from October to January&lt;ref name="EFNCPclimate"/&gt;

Late May is the sunniest time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.ie|title=Met Éireann - The Irish Weather Service|first=Met|last=Éireann|website=www.met.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701025856/http://www.met.ie/|archivedate=2007-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a good time to view flowers, with the [[gentians]] and [[Dryas (plant)|avens]] peaking (but orchid species blooming later).{{citation needed|date=December 2011|reason=some orchid species have finished flowering by this date and others are at their flowering peak}}

During counter-guerrilla operations in The Burren in 1651-52, [[Edmund Ludlow]] stated, "''(Burren) is a country where there is not enough water to drown a man, wood enough to hang one, nor earth enough to bury him...... and yet their cattle are very fat; for the grass growing in turfs of earth, of two or three foot square, that lie between the rocks, which are of limestone, is very sweet and nourishing.''"{{ref|BBC}}{{ref|clarelibrary}}

===Stratigraphy===
The area is formed from a thick succession of [[sedimentary rock]]s, largely limestones but also including [[sandstone]]s, [[mudstone]]s and [[siltstones]]. All of the solid rocks exposed at the surface are of [[Carboniferous]] age though they are underlain at depth by [[Old Red Sandstone]] of [[Devonian]] age which in turn overlies rocks of Lower [[Palaeozoic]] age. None of the pre-Carboniferous rocks is seen at the surface in the area.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Landscape and Rocks of the Burren: a guide to the geology of the area. Geological Survey of Ireland 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The limestones, which date from the [[Visean]] stage of the early Carboniferous, formed as sediments in a tropical sea approximately 325 million years ago. The strata contain fossil [[coral]]s, [[crinoid]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[ammonites]]. This bed of limestone is up to 800 metres thick. In the north and west it lies on a shelf of Galway granite which supported the upper layers, preventing shifts like those that created the "twisted" hills Knockanes and Mullaghmore. The limestone also extends below Galway Bay out to the Aran Islands and to the east into the Gort plain.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|16,33}}

Later in the Carboniferous (c. 318 million years ago), the limestone was covered by darker sand and mud that later turned into [[shale]] (the lower "Clare Shales") and [[sandstone]] (the upper "Millstone Grit"). These layers reached a thickness of up to {{convert|330|m|ft}} in north Clare. These top layers protected the underlying limestone from erosion for millions of years before being largely stripped away by glaciers, except in the south west, where they still extend from Doolin to Slieve Elva, Lisdoonvarna, Kilfenora and to the western shore of Lake Inchiquin. One "island" of shale is the hill Poulacapple, southwest of Ballyvaughan, where an upland moor has formed on top of the impermeable shale layers.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|16,33}}&lt;ref name="Feehan1"&gt;

The local geological succession comprises the following [[geological formation|formations]] some of which are subdivided into various [[Stratigraphic_unit#Lithostratigraphic_units|members]]. The youngest rocks are at the start of the list, the oldest at the bottom. The first three listed are of [[Namurian]] age and are a mix of mudstones, sandstones and siltstones, the remainder are Visean age limestones.

===Quaternary===
Glaciation during the late [[Quaternary]] period (beginning c. one million years ago) facilitated greater denudation. Glaciers expanded and retreated over the region several times. Of the last two periods the first was the more pronounced, covering the whole of the Burren. The last advance of the ice cover was more limited, affecting only the eastern Burren.&lt;ref name="Feehan1"/&gt;{{rp|20-1}}

The result is that The Burren is one of the finest examples of [[glaciokarst|glacio-karst]] landscape in the world. The effects of the [[last glacial period]] (the Midlandian) are most in evidence, with The Burren overrun by ice during this glaciation.&lt;ref name="BurrenNP_Geol"/&gt; The impact of earlier [[karstification]] (solutional erosion) has been eliminated by the last glacial period. So any surface karstification now seen dates from approximately 10,000 years ago and The Burren karst is thus very recent in geological terms. 

Solutional processes have widened and deepened the grikes of the [[limestone pavement]]. Pre-existing lines of weakness in the rock (vertical joints) contribute to the formation of extensive fissures separated by clints (flat pavement like slabs). The rock karstification facilitates the formation of subterranean drainage. This has formed numerous cave systems of which more than 50 kilometers have been mapped.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|33}} The most accessible of these is [[Aillwee Cave]].

Due to the processes mentioned, there are very few permanent surface rivers in the region. The Caher, flowing into the sea at [[Fanore]], is one of the most stable.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|33}} Some of the large valleys, mostly running south to north, that are still visible today are in fact the remains of pre-glacial river valleys. The rivers disappeared from the surface when the upper layers of stone had been stripped away. 

Another characteristic features of The Burren are closed roughly circular depressions with no surface outlets for water (called [[polje]]). Around 100 of these exist, mostly present in the eastern Burren. The most notable are the valleys of Kilcorney, Poulawilan, Caherconnel and Carran, generally stretching from northeast to southwest. The largest is the Carran depression, more than two miles long, up to a mile wide and over 200 feet deep. This is where the pre-glacial rivers of the area first eroded away the upper layers and started to dissolve the exposed limestone. Some of the smaller ones were created when caves underneath collapsed (one example of this is the Glen of Clab).&lt;ref name="Feehan1"/&gt;{{rp|19-20}}

Glaciers also deposited numerous granite and limestone [[Glacial erratic|erratics]] on the pavements. The former were carried south across Galway Bay by the second-to-last glaciation. Granite boulders can be found mostly in the north of the Burren. The final ice cover came from the northeast and mostly deposited limestone erratics. On Slieve Elva these are visible today at elevations of up to {{convert|300|m|ft}} mabove sea level. The characteristic terracing of the hills occurred when vertical joints weathered and large blocks of limestone fell off and were further eroded away.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|33}}&lt;ref name="Feehan1"/&gt;{{rp|16,21}}

Towards the very end of the Ice Age the glaciers ended for a time at Fanore. At that time, Slieve Elva and Knockauns hill alone rose above the surrounding ice fields. The valleys facing Galway Bay had been widened considerably by glacial action, first when the ice moved south from Connemara and then when meltwater sought a runoff. When the ice finally retreated it also left moraines in valley bottoms and the characteristic [[drumlin]]s (most of them on top of the shale and sandstone to the south). The Caher Valley was almost choked up by deposited sand and rocks and these also piled up against the western slopes of Slieve Elva. It was this protective layer of sediment that has made surface streams locally possible once more.&lt;ref name="Feehan1"/&gt;{{rp|21}} 

Today, the uplands' highest point is on the hill Slieve Elva, whose shale cover rises up to {{convert|345|m|ft}} above sea level.&lt;ref name="JourneyWest"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=George|title=Burren Journey West|publisher=Shannonside Mid Western Regional Tourism Organisation|year=1980|isbn=0-9503080-2-1|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}}

==Landscape types and habitats==
In addition to the limestone pavement, major landscape types, providing the habitats for the flora and fauna, include limestone heath, dry calcareous grasslands, calcareous (calcifying or petrifying) springs, the intermittent water bodies called [[turloughs]], bogs, [[cladium fens]], lakes, wet grasslands, scrub and light woodland, and neutral, and farm-improved, grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burrenprogramme.com/the-burren/habitats/|title=Habitats|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124005748/http://burrenprogramme.com/the-burren/habitats/|archivedate=2018-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
The Burren is renowned for its remarkable assemblage of plants and animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=20494847|title=Noteworthy Plants of the Burren: A Catalogue Raisonné|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 70% of Ireland's species of flowers are found there.&lt;ref name="Burrenbeo Conservation"&gt;Clare, The Burrenbeo Trust: [https://burrenbeo.com/the-burren/conservation/ The Burren - Conservation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123072636/https://burrenbeo.com/the-burren/conservation/ |date=2018-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The region supports [[arctic]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Alps|alpine]] plants side-by-side, due to the unusual environment.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

The region supports many rare Irish species, some of which are only found in this area. Others occur in similar karst areas in western Ireland. Notable plants include ''[[Festuca|Festuca indigesta]]'' seen in 1949 and ''[[Arenaria norvegica]]'' identified only once, in 1961. Two of the 24 types of ''[[Taraxacum]]'' found here are "practically unique to the Burren".&lt;ref name="Roden"/&gt;{{rp|32}} 23 of the 28 types of orchids found in Ireland grow in the Burren, including unique forms such as ''[[Dactylorhiza|Dactylorhiza fuchsii subsp. okellyi]]''.&lt;ref name="Roden"&gt;{{Citation | last =Roden| first =Cilian| contribution =The Burren Flora| year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell |editor-first1 =J.W. |editor-last2 =Korff | editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =31-41|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}}

The grikes (crevices in the limestone) provide moist shelter, supporting a wide range of plants including dwarf shrubs. Where the surface of the limestone pavement is shattered into gravel many of the hardier Arctic or alpine plants can be found, while when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil patches of grass are seen, interspersed with herbaceous plants. Among the flowers recorded from the Burren is the [[spring gentian]], an alpine plant with bright blue flowers that are used as a symbol for the area by the national tourist board, [[Failte Ireland]]. The Irish orchid (''[[Neotinea intacta]]'') and bloody cranesbill (''[[Geranium sanguineum]]'') also occur there.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, P. 2011 ''Burren Country, Travels through an Irish Limestone Landscape''. The Collins Press. {{ISBN|9781848891173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area sports 22 species of orchids and numerous other flowers such as ''[[Anacamptis pyramidalis]]'', ''[[Platanthera chlorantha]]'', ''[[Neotinea maculata]]'' and ''[[Dryas octopetala]]''. Another prominent presence in limestone grikes are around 24 types of fern, such as the Mediterranean ''[[Adiantum capillus-veneris]]''. 

The area is notable for the unusually close vicinity of both plants that hate lime and those that do well on it. Acid-loving plants such as ''[[Calluna]]'' grow well on patches of acidic peat that effectively isolates them from the underlying basic limestone.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|20-1,35-6}}

===Fauna===
Of the more than 30 species of butterflies and moths found in Ireland only two are not present in the Burren.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|37}} Notable insects present in the Burren include the butterflies the [[pearl-bordered fritillary]] (''Boloria euphrosyne''), [[brown hairstreak]] (''Thecla betulae''), [[marsh fritillary]] (''Euphydryas aurinia'') and [[Leptidea sinapis|wood white]] (''Leptidea sinapis''); the moths, the [[Calamia tridens|Burren green]] (''Calamia tridens'', which is only present in Ireland in this area),&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|37}} [[Gnophos dumetata|Irish annulet]] (''Gnophos dumetata'') and [[transparent burnet]] (''Zygaena purpuralis''); the hoverfly ''[[Doros profuges]]'' and the water-beetle ''[[Ochthebius nilssoni]]''. This last species is known from just five sites in the world, its type locality in northern Sweden and four [[marl]] lakes in The Burren.

The Burren is one of the main breeding areas in Ireland of the [[European pine marten]].  Also present are badgers, foxes and stoats. The hillsides of the Burren also host herds of feral goats.&lt;ref name="Arcy"&gt;{{Citation | last =D'Arcy| first =Gordon| contribution =The Wildlife of the Burren| year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell |editor-first1 =J.W. |editor-last2 =Korff | editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =47-58|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}}

All seven species of bats present in Ireland can be found in The Burren.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|37}} 

[[Otter]]s live along the coast, as do [[grey seals]]. [[Porpoises]], [[dolphins]] and [[basking sharks]] can be spotted off Black Head and various sections of the [[Cliffs of Moher]].

A wide range of bird species are also found in the Burren, including crows and ravens, [[peregrine falcon|peregrine falcons]], [[kestrel|kestrels]], various gulls, [[guillemot|guillemots]], [[razorbill|razorbills]], [[kittiwake|kittiwakes]], [[fulmar|fulmars]], [[puffin|puffins]] and [[European shag|shags]].

==History==
[[File:Burren Landscape 2.jpg|thumb|225px|right|The Burren landscape with Galway Bay in the background]]

===Prehistory===
[[File:Poulnabrone_Portal_Tomb_640x480.jpg|thumb|Poulnabrone portal tomb]]
Pollen analysis indicates that in the [[Mesolithic]] period of 8000 to 7000 BC The Burren looked completely different from today, with most of the uplands covered in a mixture of deciduous, pine and yew trees. No clear evidence of Mesolithic settlements or camp sites in the area has yet been discovered. At the limits of the region, near [[Lake Inchiquin]] and at the so-called "Doolin Axe Factory", stone artifacts have been discovered that may be Mesolithic in origin. However, by the [[Neolithic]], c. 4000 BC, settlers had clearly arrived and began changing the landscape through deforestation, likely by overgrazing and burning, and the building of stone walls. These people also constructed Megalithic sites like the portal tomb known as [[Poulnabrone dolmen]] and the [[Court cairn|court tombs]] at Teergonean (near Doolin) and Ballyganner (near [[Noughaval]]). Overall, there are around 70 megalithic tombs in the Burren area, more than half of all of these structures found in Clare.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|7-8}}&lt;ref name="Arch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carthy|first=Hugh|title=Burren Archaeology|publisher=The Collins Press|year=2011|isbn=9781848891050|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name="Waddell"&gt;{{Citation | last =Waddell| first =John | contribution =The First People - the Prehistoric Burren| year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell |editor-first1 =J.W. |editor-last2 =Korff | editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =59-76|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}}

The most numerous type of prehistoric structure (apart from stone walls) in The Burren is the late-Neolithic/early-[[Bronze Age]] [[Wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tomb]], mostly dated to the period 2500 to 2000 BC. It accounts for around 90% of the region's megalithic tombs. Many examples of these are found on Roughan Hill near [[Kilnaboy]], including those at [[Parknabinnia (wedge tomb)|Parknabinnia]] and [[Creevagh (wedge tomb)|Creevagh]]. Others are located at [[Gleninsheen (wedge tomb)|Gleninsheen]] and Berneens (Rathborney) and Poulaphuca (Carran). Large stone cairns on many hills, such as the [[Poulawack Cairn]], also date from this period.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;ref name="Waddell"/&gt;{{rp|63}}

The economy at that time was likely based on pastoral farming in fairly small groups. As is still done today, the cattle were moved in a reverse of the usual seasonal pattern: cattle are moved to the uplands in the winter, allowing year round grazing.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Evidence of [[Beaker culture|Beaker pottery]] was found on Roughan Hill, but in general few signs of the actual settlements of the Neolithic people have been found. This may be due to the fact that their structures were lightly built (from wood or other non-permanent materials).&lt;ref name="Arch"/&gt;{{rp|11}} 

During the Bronze Age, locals also built many ''[[Fulacht fiadh|Fulachtai fiadh]]'', remains of more than 300 survive in the region. Their exact function is still debated, but they probably served as places where water was heated by fire, either for cooking, brewing or bathing purposes.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

However, in contrast to the quantity of archaeological evidence found, the population of The Burren likely declined noticeably between the late Neolithic and the end of the Bronze Age. This was likely largely due to a shift in the climate, possibly related to the volcanic eruption known as "[[Hekla 4]]". Around the end of the 3rd millennium BC temperatures dropped and the climate became wetter. Heavy rainfall combined with previous clearing activity to cause serious soil erosion in the uplands. Evidence suggests that much of the soil cover over the limestone karst was in fact removed during the Middle and Late Bronze Age. This reduction in the area of fertile land put pressure on population numbers and probably increased conflicts over scarce resources. Building of new stone walls largely came to an end – there is a gap in documented building between the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age and early Christian periods. By the end of the Bronze Age, the uplands were largely depopulated.&lt;ref name="Arch"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

Nevertheless, like the [[Mooghaun North Hoard]] found near Newmarket-on-Fergus, the discovery of a golden Bronze Age gorget in [[Rathborney|Gleninsheen townland]] indicates the (at least temporary) local presence of a late Bronze Age society that was rich, mobile and well-connected via trade networks with other regions.&lt;ref name="Arch"/&gt;{{rp|13}} 

Like in many places of Ireland, datable [[Iron Age]] sites are rare in The Burren. This may be due to the use of dwellings that did not leave durable traces (wooden buildings or even tents). Some of the extant [[ringfort|ráths, cashels or cahers]] may actually have Iron Age origins. However, few have been excavated and those that have been the subject of research, like [[Cahercommaun]], [[Caherconnell Stone Fort|Caherconnel]], [[Cahermore ringfort|Cahermore]] or [[Ballyallaban ringfort|Ballyallaban]], are thought to be early Medieval or later in origin. The large enigmatic enclosure of Turlough Hill (see [[Oughtmama]]) may be Iron Age or earlier. Definite regional findings from this era are limited to a few bronze horse bridles discovered near Corofin and at Ballyalla ([[Kilshanny]]).&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref name="Arch"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

===Medieval===
[[File:Ucht Máma Middle and West Churches NW 2015 09 02.jpg|thumb|Early Christian churches at Oughtmama]]
[[File:Corecomroe Abbey Ruhende Statue.jpg|thumb|Tomb in the sanctuary of Corcomroe Abbey with effigy of Conor O'Brien, King of Thomond]]

In the Iron Age and early Medieval times, the region was controlled by a family or tribe known as the ''Corco Modhruadh'', meaning "seed" or "people of Modhruadh". They were one of dozens of minor tribes in Ireland at that time, which occupied a discrete area (''tuath'') and were joined by a common bloodline or origin myths. By the time Christianity arrived locally, their territory had shrunk somewhat, encompassing what later became the Baronies of Burren and Corcomroe as well as some parts of Inchiquin barony (see below).&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref name="Gosling"/&gt;{{rp|78}}

During the 5th and 6th centuries, the region appears to have been ruled from the Aran Islands by the ''Eóganacht Árann'', a minor branch of the [[Eóganachta|Eóganacht dynasty of Munster]].&lt;ref name="Gosling"&gt;{{Citation|last =Gosling|first =Paul|contribution =The Burren in Early Historic Times|year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell|editor-first1 =J.W.|editor-last2 =Korff|editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =77-91|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas|id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}}

The history of these years is uncertain, but after the decline of the ''Eóganacht Árann'' the local ''Corco Modhruadh'' likely fell under the control of the ''[[Uí Fiachrach Aidhne]]'', a tribe from what is now southern Galway, who prospered in the 7th century. The local tribes were then probably subjects of the ''[[Eóganacht Locha Léin]]'' until their influence declined in the early 9th century. Whether the ''Corco Modhruadh'' still existed as a distinct group at that point is uncertain, as they and their neighbours ''[[Corcu Baiscind]]'' may have been assimilated into or conquered by the ''[[Déisi|Déisi Tuisceart]]'' of eastern Clare, who won a major battle against the ''Corco Modhruadh'' in 744. By the 9th century, the ''Corco Modhruadh'' had been driven into the Burren uplands.&lt;ref name="Gosling"/&gt;{{rp|78}} 

The Burren area is notable for the presence of several potential or likely "early" (i.e. pre-12th-century) ecclesiastical or monastic sites. These include Kilfenora, Kilnaboy, [[Temple Cronan]] and the churches of Oughtmama. A broader definition of The Burren would also include [[Dysert O'Dea Monastery]] near Corofin and Kilmacduagh. The large number of extant cashels, almost 500 of which have been identified in The Burren (out of around 45,000 in Ireland), also indicates the presence of a sizeable (early) medieval population that supported and used these churches.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="Arch"/&gt;{{rp|19}}

At the end of the first millennium, the ''[[Dál gCais]]'' expanded into the region, against the resistance of the incumbent [[Uí Lochlainn]] and [[O'Conor]] families. The later regionally dominant [[O'Brien dynasty]] traced its origins to them. Evidence of Viking activity in the region is scant. They settled at Limerick, but in the Burren only a few artifacts of Scandinavian design have been found, centred mostly on Cahercommaun, which apparently was a major producer of wool at the time. A Viking arrowhead was found at the ringfort and a Viking hollow-bead necklace (likely dating from 820 to 850 AD) was discovered in nearby Glencurran Cave.&lt;ref name="Arch"/&gt;{{rp|21-4}}

Either at the end of the 12th or early in the 13th century, [[Cistercian]] monks came to the area and established ''Sancta Maria de Petra Fertili'', now known as [[Corcomroe Abbey]].&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

In the 12th century, the ''Corco Modhruadh''/Corcomroe territory was made into the newly created [[Diocese of Kilfenora]], of 13 parishes, and the church at Kilfenora became a cathedral.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|9-10}} 

At some point around the 12th century, the territory of "Corcomroe" was divided in two for admistrative purposes: ''Corco Modhruadh Iartharach'' ("Western Corcomroe") and ''Corco Modhruadh Oirthearach'' ("Eastern Corcomroe"), also known as ''Boireann'' which in the late 16th century became the English administrative Baronies of [[Corcomroe (barony)|Corcomroe]] and [[Burren (barony)|Burren]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Arch"/&gt;{{rp|27}}

The end of the Medieval period was a difficult era for people in the area. Like much of Europe, the region suffered from the [[Great Famine of 1315–17|Great Famine]] (1315-7) and the [[Black Death]]. In addition, infighting between the Gaelic lords contributed to a socio-economic decline of the region. This was also reflected in a regional hiatus in large construction projects during the 13th and most of the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Arch"/&gt;{{rp|30}}

===Early Modern===
For a long-time the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman incursions into Ireland]] had little direct impact on the region. As late as at the [[Battle of Dysert O'Dea]] in 1318 some of the local clans allied to defeat a Norman army led by [[Richard de Clare, Steward of Forest of Essex|Richard de Clare]]. The people and their rulers thus continued to live in fortified houses, often inside the cashels, mostly retaining their [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic culture]]. One example of this are the [[Early Irish law|Brehon]] law schools of the O'Davorans at [[Cahermacnaghten]] or the MacClancys at Doolin.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|11-4}}

Only in the 15th and 16th centuries did the [[tower houses]] as exemplified today by places like [[Newtown Castle]], [[Shanmuckinish Castle]], [[Doonagore Castle]] or [[Ballinalacken Castle]] become widespread. Norman-type castles, such as the one built at [[Quin Abbey|Quin]], were absent in the Burren.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|11-4}} T.J. Westropp counted the remains of around 70 tower houses in the Baronies of Inchiquin, Corcomroe and Burren, with 21 of them located in the latter. Only around half of those 21 survive to any height in the 21st century. The distribution of the tower houses indicates that they were built close to the barony borders, which also represented the boundaries of the territories controlled by clans or families (see below). 11 of the 21 tower houses in the Barony of Burren lie within 1 km of its borders.&lt;ref name="Gosling2"&gt;{{Citation|last =Gosling|first =Paul|contribution =The Burren in Medieval Times|year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell|editor-first1 =J.W.|editor-last2 =Korff|editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =119-34|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas|id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127,129}}

The O'Loughlin (Ó Lochlainn) clan ruled ''Boireann'' down to the mid-17th century from their chief residence at [[Gregans Castle]] (the tower house, not the house of the same name). The chief of the family was known in later times as the 'Prince of Burren' and clan members were buried in the family tomb near the altar of Corcomroe Abbey. Their kinsmen, the O'Conor (Ó Conchubhair), clan ruled ''Corco Modhruadh Iartharach'' from [[Dough Castle]] near [[Liscannor]]. The villages and towns found within the medieval territory of Boireann include Lisdoonvarna, Ballyvaughan, New Quay (Newquay) / Burrin (Burren), [[Noughaval]], Bealaclugga (Bellharbour), [[Carran|Carron]] and Fanore / Craggagh.

Both clans were eventually subjects of the O'Briens, the rulers of [[Thomond]]. Especially in the southwest, the O'Briens sometimes extended their direct influence, taking over houses and territories for themselves. They controlled the castles at [[Dromoland Castle|Dromoland]] and [[Leamaneh Castle|Leamaneh]] and later became the [[Baron Inchiquin|Barons Inchiquin]].&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

==Culture==
The Burren has a long history of traditional Irish music. It is particularly known for the "West Clare Style" of [[concertina]] playing, and music festivals in [[Doolin]] and [[Corofin, County Clare|Corofin]].  The area also has a long history as a source of artistic inspiration, and has hosted a number of art galleries.

The Burren has inspired many non-fiction books, often accompanied by extensive illustration of the landscape.  A series of [[detective fiction]] novels, written by Cora Harrison, features the Burren's [[brehon]] judge (fictional) in the early 1500s, when the area still existed as a distinct Gaelic administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://severnhouse.com/author/Cora+Harrison/9419|title=Severn House|website=severnhouse.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122235021/http://severnhouse.com/author/Cora+Harrison/9419|archivedate=2018-01-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic activity==
The leading economic activities in the Burren are agriculture and tourism.

===Tourism===
The Burren has a reputation beyond Ireland, and, most notably with the Cliffs of Moher, but also with the major [[show caves]], [[dolmens]] such as at [[Poulnabrone]] and other prehistoric sites, and centres of cultural activity, attracts tourists from a wide range of countries.  There are a range of hotels, hostels, bed and breakfast facilities, and other accommodation providers.

Tourism presents some challenges in such an environmentally sensitive area, as it creates mostly seasonal employment, results in a large share of local houses being used only in the summer, and puts additional strain on environmental resources, thus exacerbating the effect of a significant increase in the number of houses in some areas during the 1990s and 2000s.  This has been a thread in the development and preservation activities previously discussed, and has driven the growth of local ecotourism, and the "Leave No Trace" local campaigns.  Concerns have also arisen about the level of day-tourism, especially by coaches, as opposed to overnight-staying tourists, who generate significantly more revenue.

====Ecotourism in the Burren====
[[Ecotourism]] is an important factor in The Burren, with many organisations involved, including the Burren Ecotourism Network. A key goal is to deal with the challenge of protecting the vulnerable landscape, while at the same time having it provide a fair income for the local inhabitants and allowing it to cope with increased visitor numbers. [[Sustainability|Sustainable]] ecotourism and independent "'Ecotourism Certification" for companies are intended to deal with those conflicting demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theburrencentre.ie/burren-ecotourism/|title=Burren EcoTourism {{!}} The Burren Centre|website=www.theburrencentre.ie|access-date=2 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820015209/http://www.theburrencentre.ie/burren-ecotourism/|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gastro-tourism====
A Burren Food Trail was launched in 2013, and has more than 20 members offering hospitality, and / or food and drink products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burren.ie/food-dining/burren-food-trail/|title=Burren Food Trail - Visit the Burren|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028220623/http://www.burren.ie/food-dining/burren-food-trail/|archivedate=2017-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trail won the Irish prize in the European Destination of Excellence - Tourism and Local Gastronomy competition in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.failteireland.ie/footer/media-centre/the-burren-food-trail-is-cream-of-the-crop.aspx|title=Failte Ireland - The Burren Food Trail is Cream of the Crop|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129140453/http://www.failteireland.ie/footer/media-centre/the-burren-food-trail-is-cream-of-the-crop.aspx|archivedate=2018-01-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In association with the food trail events such as a Slow Food festival and a Food Fayre are organised.  The Food Fayre, part of the Burrenbeo-coordinated Winterage Festival around the October public holiday weekend, and run by the Burren Ecotourism Network and the Burren Food Trail team, reached its sixth year in 2017.

===Agriculture===
Due to climate and landscape, and techniques evolved over thousands of years, the Burren has a history as a productive agricultural landscape.  Arable farming is limited, and the main animals kept are cattle and goats.

As summarized by local landscape organisation, the Burrenbeo Trust, the traditional local system of cattle husbandry "involves exploiting the unusual attributes afforded by the region's limestone geology. Up until quite recently, hardy native breeds of beef cattle were used to graze upland grasslands between the months of October and April, requiring scarcely any dietary supplement prior to their removal to finishing grass elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/life-society/farming/farming-in-ireland-overvi/farming-in-the-burren/|title=Farming in the Burren|website=www.askaboutireland.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122181644/http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/life-society/farming/farming-in-ireland-overvi/farming-in-the-burren/|archivedate=2018-01-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the agricultural methods used but also protected the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://burrenbeo.com/the-burren/natural-heritage/agriculture/|title=Agriculture - Burrenbeo Trust|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070640/https://burrenbeo.com/the-burren/natural-heritage/agriculture/|archivedate=2018-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Challenges====
Since the 20th century the spread of intensive farming techniques (including sometimes heavy use of nitrate fertilisers) along with the possibilities offered by heavy equipment to transform limestone pavement into pasture has posed new challenges for the ecosystem and its diversity. Research conducted in the 1990s suggests that by the end of that decade the area of limestone pavement had halved since pre-Famine times, c. 1840, while from the 1970s to the 1990s alone, about 4% of pavements were converted into pasture or covered by roads. 

Despite the intensification of agriculture on the uplands{{cn|date=January 2018}}, population numbers fell from around 4,000 at the beginning of the 20th century to roughly 2,500 by the time of the 1991 Census, before rising once more. The number of farmers fell by 8% in the 1990s and average farm size increased to {{convert|100|ha|acre}} by 2001.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|39-40}}&lt;ref name="Roden"/&gt;{{rp|41}}&lt;ref name="Dunford"&gt;
{{Citation | last =Dunford| first =Brendan| contribution =Agricultural Practices and Natural Heritage| year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell |editor-first1 =J.W. |editor-last2 =Korff | editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =234-8|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|236}} 

A particular issue arose from the increasing spread of brush, notably hazel, but also blackthorn and hawthorn. These colonised more of the limestone area as a result of reduced grazing by cattle and goats. The increasing industrialization of agriculture and the introduction of different breeds of cattle led to shifts in cattle-raising practices – away from winter grazing, which kept down new growth, and towards supplementary feeding.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In addition, in the past saplings were often pulled from fields by hand to maintain grazing areas. Trees also used to be harvested for firewood, hazel rods were used for thatching as well as for fence- and basket-making. As these practices ceased, the brush advanced. This notably reduces biodiversity in the affected areas.&lt;ref name="Dunford"/&gt;{{rp|236-8}}

====BurrenLIFE====
In response to under-grazing, loss of husbandry and land management traditions, and abandonment and consolidation of farms, the BurrenLIFE program, coordinated by the geopark, launched a new sustainable farming initiative.  This began with twenty farms, representative of the diversity of local agriculture, for each of which a specific plan of costed actions was devised.  After refinement, the initiative was extended to 320 farmers over two phases, and another 130 are expected to join a final phase.  Typical recommendations enacted included scrub clearance, restoration of drystone walls, reduction in silage usage and a return to winter grazing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/eu-life-nature-award-burren-life-project-3423137-Jun2017/|title=A new project is saving the unique landscape of the Burren|first=Hayley|last=Halpin|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606122056/http://www.thejournal.ie/eu-life-nature-award-burren-life-project-3423137-Jun2017/|archivedate=2017-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balancing needs===
For the past decades, the government and private groups have attempted to square the demands of local farmers, tourists and the environment.  In particular, sometimes outdated or leaky septic tanks used by rural houses have contributed to the damage done to groundwater by agricultural practices.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In a limestone environment, the use of percolation and septic tanks may in fact not be a viable alternative to sewage treatment.{{cn|date=January 2018}} However, this is still lacking in much of the area. The sewage of the village of Ballyvaughan, for example, is still pumped untreated into the sea.&lt;ref name="ClareFM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clare.fm/news/disappointment-clare-waste-water-treatment-issues-wont-be-dealt-until-2019|title=Disappointment as Clare Waste Water Treatment Issues Won't Be Dealt With Until 2019|publisher=Clare FM|date=24 November 2016|first=|last=|accessdate=3 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104000108/http://www.clare.fm/news/disappointment-clare-waste-water-treatment-issues-wont-be-dealt-until-2019|archivedate=4 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;{{rp|40}}&lt;ref name="Broad"&gt;

Community and local authority programs have been launched over decades, notably a County Council initiative of the mid-2000s, which became ''Burren Connect'' in 2006, and led, in 2011, to the geopark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainability-leaders.com/interview-carol-gleeson-burren-geopark-ireland/|title=Interview with the Geopark Manager on Burren Connect and its predecessor and successor|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122235103/https://sustainability-leaders.com/interview-carol-gleeson-burren-geopark-ireland/|archivedate=2018-01-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn secured funding for the Geopark LIFE program.  The Burrenbeo Trust, Burren Ecotourism Network and [[Burren Way]] Committee are other examples.

==Designations==
Most of the Burren is today designated as a [[List of Special Areas of Conservation in the Republic of Ireland|Special Area of Conservation]], including almost all upland, and much of the lowland and northern shore areas.&lt;ref name="BP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burrenprogramme.com/the-programme/objectives/|title=The Burren Programme|publisher=Burren Programme|date=|first=|last=|accessdate=28 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229100446/http://burrenprogramme.com/the-programme/objectives/|archivedate=29 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also designated Areas of Scientific Interest and Natural Heritage Areas.

===Geopark===
The [[Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark]], formed in 2011 on the basis of earlier community and local authority work, is part of the [[Global Geoparks Network|Global Geoparks Network (GGN)]] and recognised by [[UNESCO]] since that year. Encompassing an expansively defined Burren, including the Cliffs of Moher, it is managed by the [[Clare County Council]] and supported by [[Failte Ireland]] and the [[Geological Survey of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burrengeopark.ie/the-organisation/|title=Our Organisation - Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark - Ireland|website=www.burrengeopark.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628194749/http://www.burrengeopark.ie/the-organisation/|archivedate=2017-06-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgeopark.org/aboutGGN/list/IrelandRepublic/6619.htm/|title=Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark|publisher=Global Geoparks Network|date=|first=|last=|accessdate=28 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925102341/http://www.globalgeopark.org/aboutGGN/list/IrelandRepublic/6619.htm|archivedate=25 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary of the Geopark extends from the vicinity of New Quay on Galway Bay, southeast to the Tubber area, then southwest to Corrofin then roughly west towards Doolin and includes the coastal strip containing the Cliffs of Moher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burrengeopark.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Map-of-the-Burren-and-Cliffs-of-Moher-Geopark.pdf|title=Map of the Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark|publisher=Burren Geopark|date=|first=|last=|accessdate=25 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201080735/http://www.burrengeopark.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Map-of-the-Burren-and-Cliffs-of-Moher-Geopark.pdf|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The geopark supports education and community engagement and sustainable tourism and other development, and employs a full-time geologist, Dr. [[Eamon N. Doyle]].

===National Park===
The '''Burren National Park''' is one of six [[National Parks in the Republic of Ireland|National Parks]] in the country. Taking in a modest sampling of the southeastern Burren, about {{convert|1500|ha|acre}}, it is made up of land purchased by the Irish government to be set aside for conservation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burrennationalpark.ie/|title=Burren National Park|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320212025/http://www.burrennationalpark.ie/|archivedate=2017-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a prolonged controversy (see [[Mullaghmore, County Clare|Mullaghmore]] and the [[Burren Action Group]]), the planned construction of a visitor centre was shelved. The National Park currently has an information point at [[Corofin, County Clare|Corofin]]. It is also associated with the preservation area at nearby [[Dromore, County Clare|Dromore Wood]].&lt;ref name="NPH"/&gt;

==Sport and leisure==
The Burren's many limestone cliffs, particularly the sea-cliffs at [[Ailladie]], are popular with [[climbing|rock-climbers]]. For [[caving|cavers]], there are a number of charted caves in the area, notably [[Pollnagollum]]. Doolin is a popular "base camp" for cavers, and is home to one of the two main cave-rescue stores of the [[Irish Cave Rescue Organisation]].

The Burren is popular with walkers and trails include the [[Burren Way]], often taken over a five day period, and the Cliffs of Moher Coastal Walk of {{convert|18|km|mi}}.

The Burren also has a range of local [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] clubs, [[Association Football|soccer]] clubs and other sporting groups.  While the landscape is challenging for maintenance of [[golf]] clubs, there are facilities near Gort and [[Lahinch Golf Club|Lahinch]].

[[File:HillOfDevi.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. [[Harcourt Brace]])]]
'''''The Hill of Devi''''' is an account by [[E. M. Forster]] of two visits to India in 1912-1913 and 1921, during which he worked as the private secretary to [[Tukojirao III]], the [[Maharaja]] of the state of [[Dewas Senior]].{{cn|date=February 2018}} The book was first published in 1953 and is dedicated to Forster's friend, the [[Indian Civil Service]] administrator [[Malcolm Lyall Darling]] with whom he had been a contemporary at [[King's College, Cambridge]] as a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=E. M. Forster: Interviews and Recollections |editor-first=J. H. |editor-last=Stape |publisher=St Martins Press |year=1993 |isbn=978-1-34912-850-1 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WX2wCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forster derived inspiration for the book from the famous hill-top temple of the Hindu Mother Goddess "[[Devi]]". The story is based in [[British India|pre-independence India]] in a nondescript kingdom in the central part of the country, Dewas. The book offers an insight into the life of Indian royalty as it skilfully revolves around the internal feud between two scions of the ruling family of Dewas. The 1924 novel ''[[A Passage to India]]'' could be read along with this book.

The hill is immediately north of the old town in Dewas, at 22.97 degrees north, 76.06 degrees east.

'''''The Truth About Crime''''' is a British television documentary series inspired and presented by [[Nick Ross]] in association with the film-maker [[Roger Graef]], executive producer Sam Collyns and series producer Alice Perman. It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] in July and August 2009.

==Region==
The show focused on a single city, [[Oxford]], which has demographics and crime rates broadly representative of urban Britain, and used a multitude of techniques to measure the real extent of crime and victimisation. In a two-week crime [[audit]], camera teams followed police, fire services and paramedics and an on-line questionnaire, based closely on the national [[British Crime Survey]], invited residents and businesspeople to describe their personal experiences of victimisation. A survey of 14- and 15-year-olds in Oxford schools was one of the biggest of its kind ever undertaken to discover how under-16s are affected by, and involved in, crime. Random children from some of the schools were then chosen to take part in the series being quizzed on crime by Ross on such topics as theft, drugs, alcohol and many other things.

==Programme 1==
The first programme ([[BBC One]] 9pm Tuesday 21 July 2009) looked at violent crime and revealed that almost all woundings involved victims who had been drinking or who had been assaulted by someone who was drunk, and took place close to a [[Licensing laws of the United Kingdom|licensed premise]].

===Lack of commensuration with official statistics===
Most of the seriously injured, as measured by those treated in hospital, did not report what had happened to the police. One senior physician told Nick Ross that police figures on crime are virtually "meaningless". The physician interviewed was Jonathan Shepherd, a Professor of [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery]] at the [[Cardiff University Dental School]]. [[Domestic violence]] was shown to be a major problem, though mostly resulting only in minor injuries, and with women as perpetrators as well as men. Women were interviewed in a [[Women's shelter]].

===Crime mapping===
[[Helmet camera]]s were shown and Spencer Chainey of the [[Jill Dando Institute]] at [[University College London]] described [[crime mapping]], which uses [[geographic information system]]s.

===Alcohol-fuelled violence===
A [[licensing officer]] from Thames Valley Police, a [[Hook Norton Brewery]] executive and [[David Poley]], the Chief Executive of the [[Portman Group]], were interviewed. Ross went on to describe several interventions which had cut [[Violence in bars and pubs|alcohol-related violence]] in the UK and elsewhere and urged a more pro-active approach to tackling alcohol-related violence. For most of the incidents, there were few arrests featured.

==Programme 2==
The second in the series (Tuesday 28 July) explored the nature of acquisitive crime and proposed solutions to burglary, car theft and fraud. Ross implied that society needs to accept human nature for what it is and focus less on how to penalise criminals and more on taking sensible precautions with tempting valuables. Temptation and opportunity drives crime far more than "badness". 90% of burglaries are to fuel a drug habit. A 19-year-old [[Single-parent|single mother]], Kelly, burgled some students, who were meanwhile happily enjoying themselves in a pub, to fund her heroin habit. A policeman said that this type of crime is committed by people who find themselves in social and emotional situations from which they find it difficult to get out of.

===Shoplifting===
There are around fifty persistent burglars in Oxford. Some of them would commit up to twenty burglaries a week. A shoplifter who was caught by CCTV in a shop, stealing a £10 set of headphones, turned out to be a 19-year-old Polish immigrant who possessed no ID. Nick Ross even confessed to [[shoplifting]] occasionally when a teenager, as did school pupils interviewed. During a normal weekday, shoplifting peaks at 3.30pm when school ends.

===Distraction burglary and scams===
Distraction [[burglary]] is different to more common random burglary, and is rarer but often more upsetting because it involves more dedicated and skilful [[Felony|felon]]s. The ruthless individuals perpetrating this crime usually target properties around the edge of Oxford near the ring road, and tend to come from outside the area. Household scams, of a ruthless and targeted similar nature, usually involved elderly people who they would be cajoled into paying astronomical prices for unnecessary repair work done on their property. The rogue traders involved were difficult to trace by county council [[Trading Standards Institute|Trading Standards]] officers. An elderly couple were conned into paying for minor repairs with their entire life savings. [[Confidence trick|Online scam]]s were more prevalent than perhaps realised, with up to £20bn of online fraud committed a year. It was investigated by the [[Electronic commerce|e-commerce]] unit of [[Serious Organised Crime Agency|SOCA]]. Richard Cox of [[The Spamhaus Project]] was interviewed about [[Computer crime|internet crime]].

===Rehabilitation===
The police thought that prison was the best place for persistent burglars. It kept the burglars off the streets. Prison was not viewed as a deterrent because the persistent offenders live such types of lives that they would be better looked after in prison than on the streets, with regular meals and companionship. Once they left prison they would quickly reoffend. [[Rehabilitation (penology)|Rehabilitation]] centres for repeat offenders and [[Drug rehabilitation|drug addicts]] were not successful because the offenders were not of a capable mental state to be sufficiently receptive or adaptive to the treatments given

===Prevention not cure===
Some of the crimes, especially rare ones targeting the elderly, are committed by lifestyle criminals, but most offenders are un-glamorously ordinary and few are "ogres" even in the eyes of the police. Most solutions lie in better design and sensible precautions. Since crime peaked in the 1990s homeowners have halved burglary rates by locking their doors and windows, retailers and tackled shoplifting by guarding their open shelves with security devices, and vehicle manufacturers have made cars so difficult to steal that auto-crime is now largely confined to old bangers.

==Programme 3==
The third and final show (Tuesday 4 August) exposed widespread [[anti-social behaviour]] and the lack of a concerted response. Much of anti-social crime is not added to the official crime statistics. Much of it is fuelled by drugs and [[Gangs in the United Kingdom|gang culture]] of under-educated and employed young males under the acronym [[NEET]]. The [[Chief Constable]] of [[Thames Valley Police]], [[Sara Thornton (police officer)|Sara Thornton]], was interviewed. It was found that improved styles of architecture for [[Housing estate|estate]] housing and [[Street light|lit thoroughfares]] can reduce anti-social crime significantly.

==Perspective on crime statistics==
Ross's general thesis is that recorded crime rates are unreliable, that theft and violence have actually declined sharply but that the downward trend may not be continuing, and that there are hundreds of quite simple solutions to crime, mostly by reducing temptations and opportunities for bad behaviour rather than trying to remould people's predispositions.

==Reception==
The series has been well received, with ''The Times''&lt;ref&gt;http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6730705.ece Andrew Billen, The Times, 29 July 2009, T2 page 14&lt;/ref&gt; "fascinated [by the] sane, insightful and compellingly argued documentary series" - and achieved good ratings despite being scheduled against [[ITV1]]'s fast-moving, similarly themed ''Car Crime UK'', a six-part police car-chasing documentary series narrated by [[Trevor McDonald]].

'''Ukrainization''' (also spelled '''Ukrainisation''' or '''Ukrainianization''') is a policy or practice of increasing the usage and facilitating the development of the [[Ukrainian language]] and promoting other elements of [[Ukrainian culture]], in various spheres of public life such as [[education]], [[publishing]], [[government]] and [[religion]]. The term is also used to describe a process by which non-Ukrainians or [[Russification of Ukraine|Russified Ukrainians]] come to accept Ukrainian culture and language as their own.

A major early case of Ukrainization relates to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] indigenization policy of the 1920s (''[[korenizatsiya]]'', literally "putting down roots"), which aimed at strengthening [[Soviet power]] in the territory of [[Soviet Ukraine]] and in southern regions of the [[Russian SFSR]]. In various forms Ukrainization policies also played out in several different periods of the twentieth-century [[history of Ukraine]], although with somewhat different goals and in different historical contexts.

Ukrainization is often cited{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} as a response to and as the means to address the consequences of previous [[assimilationist]] policies aimed at suppressing or even eradicating the Ukrainian language and culture from most spheres of public life, most notably the policy of [[Russification]] (in the times of the [[Russian Empire]] (see also [[Ems Ukaz]]) and in the [[USSR]]), but also [[Polonization]] and [[Romanianization|Rumanization]] in some Western Ukrainian regions.

After [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine | Ukraine declared its independence]] in 1991, the government of Ukraine began following a policy of Ukrainization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Revolution_2004/UKL/photos.php?UKL302|title= Світова преса про вибори в Україні-2004|accessdate= 2008-01-07|work= Архіви України|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090108154958/http://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Revolution_2004/UKL/photos.php?UKL302|archivedate= 2009-01-08|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase the use of Ukrainian while discouraging Russian, which has been gradually phased out from the country's education system,&lt;ref name=Malynkovych&gt;[[Volodymyr Malynkovych]], [http://www.igpi.ru/info/people/malink/1139380574.html Ukrainian perspective], Politicheskiy Klass, January, 2006. "Людей фактически лишают права получать образование и реализовывать свой потенциал на русском языке, родном для каждого третьего украинца, для большинства жителей Левобережья. В Центральной и Западной Украине практически не осталось русских школ. В 16 областях из 13000 школ только 26 русские (0,2%). Даже в Киеве русских школ почти не осталось - 6 из 452. Еще хуже ситуация с вузами - в 19 областях нет ни одного вуза с преподаванием на русском языке. В украинских же школах русская литература включена в курс зарубежной литературы, и Гоголя дети должны читать в переводе на украинский. По сути, только в Донбассе и в Крыму сохраняется полноценное русское образование." [In practice, they deprive people of the right to receive their education and to realize their potential in the Russian language, which is the native tongue of every third Ukrainian, and the native tongue for the majority of the inhabitants of Left-Bank Ukraine. In Central and Western Ukraine practically no Russian schools remain. In 16 oblasts [of the 24 Ukrainian oblasts], out of 13,000 schools only 26 are Russian (0.2%). Even in Kiev almost no Russian schools remain: 6 out of the 452. The situation with tertiary education is even worse: in 19 oblasts there is not a single tertiary institution with instruction carried out in the Russian language. And in Ukrainian schools Russian literature is included in the syllabus for foreign literature, and children must read Gogol in Ukrainian translation. In fact, only in the Donbas and in the Crimea is a proper Russian education preserved.]&lt;/ref&gt; government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.korrespondent.net/main/180954|title= Constitutional court forbad a socialist to report in foreign language|accessdate= June 7, 2007 |work= Korrespondent |language= Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national TV, radio programmes and films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russiatoday.ru/features/news/27078 RussiaToday : Features : Wanted: Russian-language movies in Ukraine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080731193143/http://www.russiatoday.ru/features/news/27078 |date= 2008-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2017 The ''Law on Education'' granted Ukrainian families (parents and their children) a right to choose their native language for schools and studies.&lt;ref name=COE&gt;[http://www.culturalpolicies.net/web/ukraine.php?aid=422 Ukraine/ Compendium of Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe, 10th edition], [[Council of Europe]] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNIAN 2159231"/&gt; But this law was updated in 2017 to make the Ukrainian language the primary language of education in all schools.&lt;ref name="UNIAN 2159231"/&gt;

In western historiography, the term ''Ukrainization'' refers also to a policy and resulting process of forcing ethnic minorities living on Ukrainian territories to abandon their ethnic identity by means of the enforced assimilation of Ukrainian culture and identity. During the [[aftermath of World War II]], in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] this process had been preceded by the expulsion of some ethnic minorities&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;[[Norman Davies]], ''[[God's Playground]], a History of Poland'', Columbia University Press, 1982, {{ISBN|0231053525}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0231053525&amp;id=DMoPXktGwiUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA558 p.558]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Pavel Polian]]| title= [[Against Their Will (book)| Against Their Will]]: The History and Geography of Forced Migrations in the USSR| publisher= [[Central European University Press]],  2004 |isbn= 978-963-9241-68-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appropriation of their cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Tarik Cyril Amar, ''"A Murder in Lwów.

"Ukrainization" is also used in the context of these acts.

==1917-1923: Times after the Russian Revolution==
Following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]] had dissolved, and the Ukrainians intensified their struggle for an independent Ukrainian state. In the chaos of [[World War I]] and revolutionary changes, a nascent Ukrainian state emerged but, initially, the state's very survival was not ensured. As the [[Central Rada]], the governing body, was trying to assert the control over Ukraine amid the foreign powers and internal struggle, only a limited cultural development could take place. However, for the first time in the modern history, Ukraine had a government of its own and the Ukrainian language gained usage in state affairs.

As the Rada was eventually overthrown in a German-backed coup (April 29, 1918), the rule of a [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]] led by [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] was established. While the stability of the government was only relative and Skoropadsky himself, as a former officer of the tsarist army, spoke Russian rather than Ukrainian, the Hetmanate managed to start an impressive Ukrainian cultural and education program, printed millions of [[Ukrainian-language]] textbooks, and established many Ukrainian schools, two universities, and a [[Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]]. The latter established a Committee on Orthography and Terminology, which initiated a scholarly and methodological research program into Ukrainian terminology.&lt;ref name=UkrWeekly&gt;Stephen D. Olynyk, "[http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1997/079719.shtml ANALYSIS: The status of Ukrainian military terminology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830191431/http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1997/079719.shtml |date=2006-08-30 }}", ''The Ukrainian Weekly'', February 16, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hetmanate's rule ended with the German evacuation and was replaced by the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] government of [[Symon Petlura]]. However, Ukraine submerged into a new wave of chaos facing two invasions at the same time, from the East by the [[Bolshevik]] forces and from the West by the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] troops, as well as being ravaged by armed bands that often were not backed by any political ideology. 

==1923-1931: Early years of Soviet Ukraine==
[[File:Ukposter.jpg|thumb|The 1921 Soviet recruitment to the Military Education poster with the Ukrainization theme. The text reads: "Son! Enroll in the school of [[Red Army|Red commanders]], and the defence of [[Soviet Ukraine]] will be ensured." The poster uses traditional Ukrainian imagery with Ukrainian-language text to reach a wider appeal. The School of Red Commanders in [[Kharkov]] was organized to promote the careers of the Ukrainian national cadre in the army.&lt;ref name=Army&gt;"Ukrainization, although with less success, was implemented in the Army (School of Red Commanders in Kharkov, newspaper of the Ukrainian Military District "Chervona Armiya" published until mid-1930s, etc.)". ''Encyclopedia of Ukrainian studies)'' cited above&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As [[Bolshevik]] rule took hold in Ukraine, the early Soviet government had its own reasons to encourage the national movements of the former [[Russian Empire]]. While trying to ascertain and consolidate its power, the Bolshevik government was by far more concerned about political oppositions connected to the pre-revolutionary order than about the national movements inside the former empire. The reversal of the assimilationist policies of the [[Russian Empire]] was potentially done to help to improve the image of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government and boost its popularity among the common people.

Until the early-1930s, Ukrainian culture enjoyed a widespread revival due to Bolshevik policies known as the policy of [[Korenization]] ("indigenization"). In these years a Ukrainization program was implemented throughout the republic. In such conditions, the Ukrainian national idea initially continued to develop and even spread to a large territory with traditionally mixed population in the east and south that became part of the Ukrainian Soviet republic.

The All-Ukrainian [[Sovnarkom]]'s decree "On implementation of the Ukrainization of the educational and cultural institutions" (July 27, 1923) is considered to be the onset of the Ukrainization program. The (August 1) decree that followed shortly "On implementation of the equal rights of the languages and facilitation of the Ukrainian language" mandated the implementation of Ukrainian language to all levels of state institutions. Initially, the program was met with resistance by some [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine|Ukrainian Communists]], largely because non-Ukrainians prevailed numerically in the party at the time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The resistance was finally overcome in 1925 through changes in the party leadership under the pressure of Ukrainian representatives in the party. In April 1925 the party Central Committee adopted the resolution on Ukrainization proclaiming its aim as "solidifying the union of the peasantry with the working class" and boosting the overall support of the Soviet system among Ukrainians. A joint resolution aimed at "complete Ukrainization of the Soviet apparatus" as well as the party and trade unions was adopted on April 30, 1925. The Ukrainian Commissariat of Education (Narkomis) was charged with overseeing the implementation of the Ukrainization policies. The two figures, therefore, most identified with the policy are [[Oleksander Shumskyi]], the Commissar for Education between 1923 and 1927, and [[Mykola Skrypnyk]], who replaced Shumskyi in 1927.

The Ukrainian-language based education system dramatically raised the literacy of the Ukrainophone rural population. By 1929 over 97% of high school students in the republic were obtaining their education in Ukrainian&lt;ref name=Ivanyshyn&gt;Vasyl Ivanyshyn, Yaroslav Radevych-Vynnyts'kyi, ''[http://www.vesna.org.ua/txt/ivanyshynv/movnaz/index.html Mova i Natsiya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060604050113/http://www.vesna.org.ua/txt/ivanyshynv/movnaz/index.html |date=2006-06-04 }}'', Drohobych, Vidrodzhennya, 1994, {{ISBN|5-7707-5898-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and illiteracy dropped from 47% (1926) to 8% in 1934.&lt;ref name=EncUkr&gt;[[Volodymyr Kubiyovych]];  Zenon Kuzelia, Енциклопедія українознавства ''(Encyclopedia of Ukrainian studies)'', 3-volumes,  Kiev, 1994, {{ISBN|5-7702-0554-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously, the newly literate ethnic Ukrainians migrated to the cities, which became rapidly largely Ukrainianized — in both population and education. Between 1923 and 1933 the Ukrainian proportion of the population of [[Kharkov]], at the time the capital of [[Soviet Ukraine]], increased from 38% to 50%. Similar increases occurred in other cities, from 27.1% to 42.1% in [[Kiev]], from 16% to 48% in [[Dnipropetrovsk]], from 16% to 48% in [[Odessa]], and from 7% to 31% in [[Luhansk]].&lt;ref name=EncUkr/&gt;

Similarly expansive was an increase in Ukrainian language publishing and the overall flourishing of Ukrainian cultural life. As of 1931 out of 88 theatres in Ukraine, 66 were Ukrainian, 12 were Jewish ([[Yiddish]]) and 9 were Russian. The number of Ukrainian newspapers, which almost did not exist in 1922, had reached 373 out of 426, while only 3 all-republican large newspapers remained Russian. Of 118 magazines, 89 were Ukrainian. Ukrainization of book-publishing reached 83%.&lt;ref name=EncUkr/&gt;

Ukrainization was thoroughly implemented through the government apparatus, [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine|Communist Party of Ukraine]] membership and, gradually, the party leadership as well, as the recruitment of indigenous cadre was implemented as part of the korenization policies. At the same time, the usage of Ukrainian was continuously encouraged in the workplace and in government affairs. While initially, the party and government apparatus was mostly Russian-speaking, by the end of the 1920s ethnic Ukrainians composed over one half of the membership in the Ukrainian communist party, the number strengthened by accession of [[Borotbists]], a formerly indigenously Ukrainian "independentist" and non-Bolshevik communist party.&lt;!--Please explain??--&gt;

In the all-Ukrainian [[Ispolkom]], central executive committee, as well as in the [[oblast]] level governments, the proportion of Ukrainians reached 50.3% by 1934 while in [[raion]] ispolkoms the number reached 68.8%. On the city and village levels, the representation of Ukrainians in the local government bodies reached 56.1% and 86.1%, respectively. As for other governmental agencies, the Ukrainization policies increased the Ukrainian representation as follows: officers of all-republican [[People's Commissar]]iat (ministries) - 70-90%, [[oblast]] executive brunches - 50%, [[raion]] - 64%, [[Judiciary]] - 62%, [[Militsiya]] (law enforcement) - 58%.

The attempted Ukrainization of the armed forces, [[Red Army]] formations serving in Ukraine and abroad, was less successful although moderate progress was attained. The [[Schools of Red Commanders]] (''Shkola Chervonyh Starshyn'') was organized in [[Kharkov]] to promote the careers of the Ukrainian national cadre in the army (see picture). The Ukrainian newspaper of the Ukrainian Military District "Chervona Armiya" was published until the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name=Army/&gt; The efforts were made to introduce and expand Ukrainian terminology and communication in the Ukrainian Red Army units.&lt;ref name=UkrWeekly/&gt; The policies even reached the army units in which Ukrainians served in other Soviet regions. For instance the [[Soviet Pacific Fleet]] included a Ukrainian department overseen by [[Semyon Rudniev]].&lt;ref name=Rudnev&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=|url=http://lib.dvgu.ru/maintext/menu/vist/Viktoriya/Rudnev.htm|title=Rudnev Semen Vasilyevich|work=|pages=|publisher=Library of the Far East State University|accessdate=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927031304/http://lib.dvgu.ru/maintext/menu/vist/Viktoriya/Rudnev.htm|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, despite the ongoing Soviet-wide anti-religious campaign, the Ukrainian national [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] was created, the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] (See [[History of Christianity in Ukraine]]). The Bolshevik government initially saw the national churches as a tool in their goal to suppress the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], always viewed with great suspicion by the regime for its being the cornerstone of the defunct Russian Empire and the initially strong opposition it took towards the regime change. Therefore, the government tolerated the new Ukrainian national church for some time and the UAOC gained a wide following among the Ukrainian peasantry.

Ukrainization even reached those regions of southern [[Russian SFSR]], particularly the areas by the [[Don River, Russia|Don]] and [[Kuban River|Kuban]] rivers, where mixed population showed strong Ukrainian influences in the local dialect. Ukrainian language teachers, just graduated from expanded institutions of higher education in Soviet Ukraine, were dispatched to these regions to staff newly opened Ukrainian schools or to teach Ukrainian as a second language in Russian schools. A string of local Ukrainian-language publications was started and departments of Ukrainian studies were opened in colleges. Overall, these policies were implemented in thirty-five administrative districts in southern Russia.&lt;ref name=Tereshchenko&gt;{{uk icon}}"The campaign was implemented in 35 raions of the Russian Republic [Stavropol, Krasnodar (Kuban), Republic of Karachaev-Cherkessiya] most of which still exist to this day."{{cite conference | author = Oleksandr Tereshchenko | date = December 2004 | title = Ukrainian renaissance in the south of Russia | booktitle = Cultural connections of Donetsk region with the Ukrainian Diaspora | editor =  | publisher =  | location =  | pages =  | url = http://vesna.org.ua/txt/sxid/conference.doc | id =  | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060526094834/http://www.vesna.org.ua/txt/sxid/conference.doc | archivedate = 2006-05-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 1930s (reversal of Ukrainization policies)==
Starting from the early 1930s, the Ukrainization policies were abruptly and bloodily reversed. "[[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism]]" was declared to be the primary problem in Ukraine. Many Ukrainian newspapers, publications, and schools were switched to Russian.  The vast majority of leading scholars and cultural leaders of Ukraine [[Great Purge|were purged]], as were the "Ukrainianized" and "Ukrainianizing" portions of the Communist party.

Major repression started in 1929–30, when a large group of Ukrainian intelligentsia was arrested and most were executed. In Ukrainian history, this group is often referred to as "[[Executed Renaissance]]" (Ukrainian: розстріляне відродження). The terror peaked in 1933, four to five years before the Soviet-wide "Great Purge", which, for Ukraine, was a second blow. The vast majority of leading scholars and cultural leaders of Ukraine were liquidated, as were the "Ukrainianized" and "Ukrainianizing" portions of the Communist party.

At the 12th Congress of the [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine|Communist Party of Ukraine]], Moscow-appointed leader [[Pavel Postyshev]] declared that "1933 was the year of the defeat of Ukrainian nationalist counter-revolution."&lt;ref&gt;''"12th Congress of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine, Stenograph Record"'', Kharkiv 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; This "defeat" encompassed not just the physical extermination of a significant portion of the Ukrainian peasantry, but also the virtual elimination of the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] clergy and the mass imprisonment or execution of Ukrainian intellectuals, writers and artists.

Ukrainian music ensembles had their repertoires severely restricted and censored.  Foreign tours by Ukrainian artists were canceled without explanation.  Many artists were arrested and detained often for months at a time without cause. After not receiving any pay for many months, many choirs and artistic ensembles such as the [[Kiev Bandurist Capella|Kiev]] and [[Poltava Bandurist Capella]]s ceased to exist. Blind traditional folk musicians known as [[kobzar]]s were summoned from all of Ukraine to an ethnographic conference and disappeared (See [[Persecuted bandurists]]).

In the regions of southern Russian SFSR ([[North Caucasus]] and eastern part of [[Sloboda Ukraine]] included into RSFSR) Ukrainization was effectively outlawed in 1932.&lt;ref name="ukrainianweek43727b"&gt; [http://ukrainianweek.com/History/43727 Unknown Eastern Ukraine], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (14 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the December 14, 1932 decree "On Grain Collection in Ukraine, North Caucasus and the Western Oblasts" by the [[VKP(b)]] [[Central Committee]] and USSR [[Sovnarkom]] stated that Ukrainization in certain areas was carried out formally, in a "non-Bolshevik" way, which provided the "bourgeois-nationalist elements" with a legal cover for organizing their anti-Soviet resistance. In order to stop this, the decree ordered in these areas, among other things, to switch to Russian all newspapers and magazines,  and all Soviet and [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|cooperative]] paperwork. By the autumn of 1932 (beginning of a school year), all schools were ordered to switch to Russian. In addition the decree ordered a massive population swap: all "disloyal" population from a major Cossack settlement, ''[[stanitsa]]'' [[Poltavskaya (rural locality)|Poltavskaya]]  was banished to [[Northern Russia]], with their property given to loyal [[kolkhoznik]]s moved from poorer areas of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://istmat.info/node/38297 Постановление ЦК ВКП(б) и СНК СССР «О хлебозаготовках на Украине, Северном Кавказе и в Западной области». 14 декабря 1932 г.] (December 14, 1932 decree "On Grain Collection in Ukraine, North Caucasus and the Western Oblast"); Russian archive ([[RGASPI]]) entry: РГАСПИ. Ф. 17. Оп. 3. Д. 2025. Л. 42—42 об.&lt;/ref&gt; This forced end to Ukrainization in southern RSFSR had led to a massive decline of reported Ukrainians in these regions in the [[Soviet Census (1937)|1937 Soviet Census]] compared to the 1926 [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="ukrainianweek43727b"/&gt;

==1930s to mid-1980==
The Communist Party of Ukraine, under the guidance of state officials like [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Stanislav Kosior]], and Pavel Postyshev, boasted in early 1934 of the elimination of "counter-revolutionaries, nationalists, spies and class enemies". Whole academic organizations, such as the Bahaliy Institute of History and Culture, were shut down following the arrests.

In 1935-36, 83% of all school children in the Ukrainian SSR were taught in Ukrainian even though Ukrainians made up about 80% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Grigor Suny, ''The Soviet Experiment''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 from 1830 newspapers 1402 were in Ukrainian, as were 177 magazines, in 1936 69 104 thousand Ukrainian books were printed.&lt;ref&gt;"Soviet Ukraine for 20 years" p.102 Ukrainian SRR Academy of Science 1938 Kiev, also same data in Statistical Compendium 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following fifty years the Soviet policies towards the Ukrainian language mostly varied between quiet discouragement and suppression to persecution and cultural purges, with the notable exception for the decade of [[Petro Shelest]]'s Communist Party leadership in the [[Soviet Ukraine]] (1963–1972). The mid-1960s were characterized by moderate Ukrainization efforts in governmental affairs as well as the resurgence of the usage of Ukrainian in education, publishing and culture.&lt;ref name=Shelest&gt;"Shelest came to power on the ''wave of post-war "Ukrainization" of the party and state apparatus of the Ukrainian SSR'' and the rise of the role of Ukrainian party elite on the Soviet leadership. [...] On the background of the general policies of Russification and Sovietization significant were his declarations aimed at the protection of the Ukrainian language in school education, the printed press, magazines and books. He defended several representatives of Ukrainian culture from the accusations of Ukrainian nationalism."&lt;br&gt;''Encyclopedia of Ukrainian studies)'' cited above&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eventually, all effects of Ukrainization were undone yet again and Ukraine gradually became [[Russification|russified]] to a significant degree. These policies softened somewhat only in the mid-to-late 1980s and were completely reversed again in newly independent Ukraine in the 1990s.

==Post-1991: independent Ukraine==
[[File:Here is Ukrainian spoken.jpg|thumb|left|''According to a resolution by [[Verkhovna Rada|the parliament of Ukraine]] on 28 February 1989 "Regarding the state-nature and official status of the Ukrainian language in institutions and organizations" we speak [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] here'' : an announcement in a [[Lviv]] hospital about the use of the Ukrainian language]]
On 28 October 1989, the [[Supreme Soviet]] of [[Ukrainian SSR]] changed the Constitution and adopted the "Law of Languages".&lt;ref name=LoL&gt;See [http://www.minelres.lv/NationalLegislation/Ukraine/Ukraine_Language_English.htm highlights in English]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ukrainian language was declared the only [[official language]], while the other languages spoken in Ukraine were guaranteed constitutional protection. The government was obliged to create the conditions required for the development and use of Ukrainian language as well as languages of other ethnic groups, including [[Russian language|Russian]]. Usage of other languages, along with Ukrainian, was allowed in local institutions located in places of residence of the majority of citizens of the corresponding ethnicities.  Citizens were guaranteed the right to use their native or any other languages and were entitled to address various institutions and organisations in Ukrainian, in Russian, or in another language of their work, or in a language acceptable to the parties. After the Ukrainian accession of independence following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] the law, with some minor amendments, remained in force in the independent Ukrainian state.

Adopted in 1996, the new [[Constitution of Ukraine]] confirmed the [[official language|official state status]] of the Ukrainian language, and guaranteed the free development, use, and protection of Russian and other languages of national minorities of Ukraine.&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;According to the [http://www.rada.gov.ua/const/conengl.htm#r1 Article 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521190059/http://www.rada.gov.ua/const/conengl.htm |date=2011-05-21 }} of the Constitution: "The state language of Ukraine is the Ukrainian language. The State ensures the comprehensive development and functioning of the Ukrainian language in all spheres of social life throughout the entire territory of Ukraine. In Ukraine, the free development, use and protection of Russian, and other languages of national minorities of Ukraine, is guaranteed."&lt;/ref&gt;

Language issues are still used by politics to generate controversy. On May 20, 2008, [[Donetsk]] city council passed a resolution limiting the expansion of Ukrainian-language education in the city.  The following day the city prosecutor declared the decision illegal and the mayor suspended it, and the council reversed itself two days later.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/125348.html Donetsk City Council Cancels Resolution Restricting Use Of Ukrainian Language In Educational Establishments] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120918130005/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/125348.html |date=2012-09-18 }}”, Ukrainian News Agency, May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to March 2010 survey, forced Ukrainization and Russian language suppression are among the least troubling problems for Ukrainian citizens, concerning only 4.8% of population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://life.pravda.com.ua/problem/4bc31444820e5/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414143601/http://life.pravda.com.ua/problem/4bc31444820e5/ |archivedate=2010-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of independent Ukraine implemented policies to broaden the use of Ukrainian and mandated a progressively increased role for Ukrainian in the media and commerce. The most significant was the government's concerted effort to implement Ukrainian, as the only official state language in the country, into the state educational system. Despite the Constitution, the ''Law on Education'' (grants Ukrainian families (parents and their children) a right to choose their native language for schools and studies&lt;ref name=COE/&gt;) as well as the [[Law of Languages]] (a guarantee for the protection of all languages in Ukraine) the education system gradually reshaped from a system that was only partly Ukrainian to the one that is overwhelmingly so. The Russian language is still studied as a required course in all secondary schools, including those with Ukrainian as the primary language of instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ostriv.in.ua/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1519&amp;Itemid=1335&amp;ft=1|title=Співпраця України і Російської Федерації у сфері освіти і науки - Острів знань|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of secondary school students who received their primary education in Ukrainian has grown from 47.9% in 1990-1991.&lt;ref name=1991data&gt;See Ivanyshyn, cited above&lt;/ref&gt; (the last school year before the Ukrainian independence) to 67.4% in 1999&lt;ref name=RadaRightsCommiss&gt;"the number of Ukrainian secondary schools has increased to 15,900, or 75% of their total number.

The Ukrainization has achieved even greater gains in the higher education institutions where as of 1990-1991 only 7% of students were being taught primarily in Ukrainian.&lt;ref name=1991data/&gt; By 2003-2004 the percentage of the college and [[Tekhnikum|technicum]] students studying in Ukrainian reached 87.7% and for the students of the University-level institutions this number reached 80.1% (see table).

The extent of educational institutions' Ukrainization varies in the different regions of Ukraine. In the 16 western [[oblast]]s (provinces) of Ukraine there are 26 Russian language schools out of 12,907&lt;ref name=IIMHI/&gt; and in Kiev 6 out of 452 schools use Russian as their primary language of instruction,&lt;ref name=Malenkovich&gt;''In Central and [[Ukraine|Western Ukraine]] there are practically no Russian schools left.

''In 19 oblasts there is not a single institution with the instruction in Russian.'' In Ukrainian schools, [[Russian literature]] is included in the international literature course and children have to learn Gogol in the Ukrainian translation.

The increase of the share of secondary school students obtaining education in Ukrainian (from 47.9% to 67%) over the first decade of the Ukrainian independence roughly corresponded to the share of native Ukrainian speakers - 67.5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/general/language/ Population composition by the native language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510134557/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/general/language/ |date=2006-05-10 }} according to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Schools continue to be transferred to the Ukrainian language up to this day.

In some cases, the changing of the language of instruction in institutions, led to the charges of assimilation, raised mostly by the Russian-speaking population.  Despite this, the transition was gradual and lacked many controversies that surrounded the [[de-Russification]] in several of the other former [[Soviet Republics]], its perception within Ukraine remained mixed,&lt;ref name=Jamestown1&gt;"There has been no consistent policy of Ukrainianization.

&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian authorities have defended the ban, stating that it aims to develop a home-grown Ukrainian distribution industry and to give Ukrainian distributors "muscle" in negotiating their own deals to buy foreign films.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; Russian distributors control around 90% of foreign films screened in Ukraine and tend to supply Russian-language dubbed or subtitled copies that are part of wider packages distributed throughout Russia and the former Soviet territories. Andriy Khalpakhchi, director the [[Ukrainian Cinema Foundation]], claims "Some European sellers at Berlin's film market are reporting that Russian buyers are already threatening not to buy films if they sell directly to Ukraine without using Russian distribution channels."&lt;ref name=variety&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Despite earlier fears that there would be problems due to the introduction of compulsory Ukrainian dubbing of films, the number of visitors to Ukrainian cinemas soared by 40% in [[Calendar year|Q1]] of the year 2009 compared to the same period of the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;

Several [[Television in Russia#List of channels|Russian TV channels]] have not been allowed to broadcast in Ukraine since November 1, 2008, according to Ukraine's National Council on Television and Radio Broadcasting mainly because of the advertising aired by the channels.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The Ukrainian distributors of television channels were ordered{{by whom|date=May 2014}} to bring the broadcasts in line with Ukrainian laws. [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]] and [[Ren TV]] have since been granted temporary permission to broadcast, while a separate version of [[RTR Planeta]] was started specially for Ukrainian TV viewers in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;

On May 13, 2010, [[Russian Foreign Minister]] [[Sergei Lavrov]] claimed that in Ukraine "the discriminatory, {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated, ideology-tinged and [[anti-Russian]] decisions that were being made when [[Yuschenko]] was [[Ukrainian President|President]] have been lifted".&lt;ref&gt;

On 23 May 2017 Ukrainian parliament approved the law proposed in November 2016 that demands national, regional, satellite, and multi-channel TV and radio networks to broadcast at least 75% of their content (summarized on weekly basis separately in time intervals 7{{nbsp}}am{{snd}}6{{nbsp}}pm and 6{{nbsp}}pm{{snd}}10{{nbsp}}pm) in Ukrainian starting from 13 October 2017. 50% is required from local networks, and 75% of news programs is required in Ukrainian for all networks. Films and broadcasts which are not products of these networks and produced after 1991 must be broadcast exclusively in Ukrainian. Reasonable exceptions are provided for inclusion of non-Ukrainian language into otherwise Ukrainian-language broadcasts. The [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine]] may permit exceptions to this law for broadcasts which serve elimination of threats to national security.&lt;ref&gt;Офіційний портал Верховної Ради України.

===Politics===
In two presidential elections, in 1994 and 2004, the role of languages in Ukraine was an important election issue. In 1994 the main opposition candidate, [[Leonid Kuchma]], in an attempt to widen his political appeal, expressed his support for the idea of Russian becoming the second state language, as well as promising to improve his knowledge of the Ukrainian language. In addition to the stagnating economy, the language issue likely contributed to Kuchma's victory in the election; but while his knowledge of Ukrainian noticeably improved, Kuchma did not follow through on his pledge to make Russian a state language during the 10 years of his presidency.

In 2004 an election promise by [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (leader of the [[Party of Regions]]) to adopt Russian as the second official language might also have increased the turnout of his base, but it was rebutted during the campaign by his opponent ([[Viktor Yushchenko]]), who pointed out that Yanukovych could have already taken steps towards this change while he was a [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] if this had really been his priority. During his campaign Yushchenko emphasized that his being painted as a proponent of the closure of Russian schools frequently made by his opponents is entirely baseless and stated his view that the issue of school language, as well as the churches, should be left to local communities.&lt;ref name=debates&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2004/12/20/15006.htm Transcript of televised debates between Yushchenko and Yanukovych of December 20, 2006], ''[[Ukrainska Pravda]]'', December 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, during Yuchshenko's presidency the transfer of educational institutions from Russian to Ukrainian continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2005/06/02/exams/|title=На Украине запретят сдавать экзамены в вузы на русском|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edrus.org/content/view/1210/69/|title=www.edrus.org/content/view/1210/69/ - Сервис регистрации доменов и хостинга *.RU-TLD.RU|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ura.dn.ua/archive/?/2006/03/04/~/389|title=В Горловке закрывают русскоязычные школы|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151354/http://ura.dn.ua/archive/?%2F2006%2F03%2F04%2F~%2F389|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|2006 parliamentary election]] the status of the Russian language in Ukraine was brought up again by the opposition parties. The leading opposition party, [[Party of Regions]], promised to introduce two official languages, Russian and Ukrainian, on the national and regional levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.partyofregions.org.ua/contrprop/resonance/444f3980d4979/ Russian language is legalized.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011084307/http://www.partyofregions.org.ua/contrprop/resonance/444f3980d4979/ |date=2007-10-11 }} [[Party of Regions]] information server&lt;/ref&gt; On the national level such changes require modifying Article 10 of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], which the party hopes to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.partyofregions.org.ua/pr-east-west/44857865032d4/ Borys Kolesnikov: Both languages, Russian and Ukrainian need protection.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816094822/http://www.partyofregions.org.ua/pr-east-west/44857865032d4 |date=2009-08-16 }} [[Party of Regions]] information server&lt;/ref&gt; Before the election in Kharkiv, and following the election in the other south-eastern regions such as [[Donetsk]], [[Dnipropetrovsk]], [[Luhansk]], [[Mykolaiv]], and the Crimea, the newly elected local councils, won by the Party of Regions (and minor supporting parties), declared Russian as a regional language, citing the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], ratified by Ukraine in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mosnews.com/news/2006/06/03/officiallanguage.shtml Ukrainian Region Makes Russian Official Language]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} MosNews.

In the wake of the [[2006 Parliamentary crisis in Ukraine]] that fractured the governing coalition and returned Yanukovych to the Prime Ministership, the "[[Universal of National Unity]]" signed by President Yushchenko as well as the leaders of several of the most influential political parties declared that Ukrainian would remain the official state language in Ukraine. However, within a week after signing the Universal, Yanukovych, then approved as [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]], stated at a press conference in [[Sochi]] ([[Russia]]) that the implementation of Russian as a second state language remains the goal of his party even though he does not see it achieved in the immediate future because such a change, which would require amending the Constitution, would not collect the required majority (⅔) in the [[Verkhovna Rada|Parliament of Ukraine]] given the current political situation.&lt;ref name=YanukSochi&gt;{{Ru icon}} Ksenia Solyanskaya, "[http://www.korrespondent.net/main/161757 Gas would bring us closer]", [[Gazeta.ru]] August 16, 2006. Reprinted by [[Korrespondent]].net&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[electoral campaign]] for the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|2010 Ukrainian presidential election]] Yanukovych at first stated that if he would be elected [[President of Ukraine|President]] he then will do everything in order to make Russian the second state language in Ukraine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-334266.html Yanukovych imagines how he signs law on Russian language], [[UNIAN]] (September 3, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; but in an interview with [[Kommersant]] later during the campaign he stated that the status of Russian in Ukraine "is too politicized" and said that if elected President in 2010 he would "have a real opportunity to adopt a law on languages, which implements the requirements of the [[European Charter of regional languages]]". He implied this law would need 226 votes in the [[Ukrainian parliament]] (50% of the votes instead of the 75% of the votes needed to change the [[constitution of Ukraine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.kommersant.ua/doc.html?docId=1289144 "Доверия к Тимошенко у меня нет и быть не может"], [[Kommersant]] (December 9, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; After his early 2010 election as President Yanukovych stated (on March 9, 2010) "Ukraine will continue to promote the Ukrainian language as its only state language".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/61283/ Yanukovych: Ukraine will not have second state language], [[Kyiv Post]] (March 9, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
According to the laws on civil and administrative procedure enacted in Ukraine in 2005, all legal and court proceedings in Ukraine are to be conducted in Ukrainian. This does not restrict, however, the usage of other languages, as the law guarantees interpretation services for any language desired by a citizen, defendant or witness.

'''Waller Air Force Base''' is a former [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[World War II]] air base located in northeastern [[Trinidad]]. It is located about 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of [[Valencia, Trinidad and Tobago|Valencia]] south of the [[Churchill-Roosevelt Highway]] and roughly 32&amp;nbsp;km from the capital city [[Port of Spain]].

==History==
The American rights to the airfield were obtained via the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]] in September 1940 when the United States transferred fifty destroyers to [[Great Britain]] in exchange for Army and Navy base rights on British possessions in the Americas.

In 1941, Trinidad was alarmed by a large number of [[Nazi]] [[U-Boat]]s prowling off its coastline, intent on disrupting British shipping in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and using the [[Vichy French]] controlled island of [[Martinique]] as a possible supply facility.  Although the first [[United States Army]] personnel arrived on Trinidad on 24 April 1941, it was only after the United States' entry into the war, that Allied planners, in early 1942, decided to counter the Nazi threat by establishing major air and naval facilities on Trinidad.

Waller Army Airfield was activated on 1 September 1941 with the assignment of the 92d Service Group.  The unit's mission was to establish a flying facility within the [[United States Army]] [[Fort Read]] post. The unit consisted of the group's Headquarters, and the 92d Air Base and 309th Material Squadrons. The group was assigned to the [[Sixth Air Force|Caribbean Air Force]].

[[File:Waller AFB mess hall sign.jpg|thumb|Sign for Waller AFB mess hall]] Waller Field was named after United States Army Air Corps Major Alfred J. Waller, a distinguished [[World War I]] combat pilot, killed in the crash of a Consolidated [[PB-2A]] at [[Langley Field]] on 11 December 1937. The airfield was intended to have four runways, but the two southern ones were cancelled due to the nature of the ground.

Waller was built to be the premier US combat airbase in Trinidad, but events overtook the plan. The South Atlantic Air Route to Europe quickly developed and became the most often used method of getting aircraft to the African and European theaters of war. [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] flew aircraft to Waller from [[South Florida]] airfields, then from Waller, aircraft were flown to [[Val de Cães International Airport|Belem Airfield]], [[Brazil]], then across the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] to [[Lungi International Airport|Freetown Airport]], [[Sierra Leone]] and then to [[North Africa]] or [[England]]. Airfield congestion at Waller became so acute that the combat aircraft, the bombers actually confronting the U-Boats, had to be moved out to [[Carlsen Air Force Base|Edinburgh (Carlsen) Airfield]] when it was completed.

With the establishment of United States bases on Trinidad and other Caribbean islands, the Nazi menace was eliminated by the action of numerous air and naval patrols. In 1943, President Roosevelt visited Waller Field on his way to the [[Casablanca Conference]] in North Africa.

{{small|*Reassigned from [[Fifteenth Air Force]] in [[Italy]] and used [[B-24 Liberator]] aircraft as transports moving personnel from [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean Theater]] to the United States}}

In addition to the combat and transport flying units, Waller Field was also used as an aircraft  maintenance and supply facility by the 24th Air Depot ([[Air Force Logistics Command|Air Technical Service Command]]) which was deployed from [[Kelly Field]], [[Texas]] on 20 January 1942. It was also used as a long-range reconnaissance base by several photo-recon squadrons.

==Postwar use==
With the end of World War II Waller Airfield was reduced in scope to a skeleton staff.   It was redesignated Waller Air Force Base on 26 March 1948, by the Department of the Air Force General Order Number 10.

Its primary use was by [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS) as a transit facility under the [[24th Wing|24th Composite Wing]] based at [[Ramey AFB|Borinquen AFB]], [[Puerto Rico]] and by the MATS 6th Weather Squadron (Regional), which provided meteorological reports for aviation in the South Caribbean as well as tropical storm and hurricane reporting.  [[Harry S. Truman|President Harry S. Truman]] stopped at Waller Field on 31 August 1947 on his way to Brazil during a South American visit.

Waller AFB was closed on 28 May 1949 due to budgetary cutbacks and MATS operations were shifted to bases in the [[Panama Canal Zone]].

After the base's closure, it became the informal home of various types of racing (using former airstrips) for over 40 years. Today construction progresses on the former airfield site of the Tamana InTech Park,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamana.com/apps/cms/info/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; a science and technology park which will include amenities including real estate lots for industries as well as the new multimillion-dollar [[University of Trinidad and Tobago]] campus complex, several housing developments and other projects.

'''William Bright''' (August 13, 1928 [[Oxnard, California]] – October 15, 2006 [[Louisville, Colorado]]) was an American [[linguist]] who specialized in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[South Asia]]n languages and [[descriptive linguistics]].

Bright earned a bachelor's degree in [[linguistics]] in 1949 and a doctorate in the same field in 1955, both from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He was a professor of [[linguistics]] and [[anthropology]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] from 1959 to 1988.  He then moved to the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], where he remained on the faculty until his death.

Bright was an authority on the native languages and cultures of [[California]], and was especially known for his work on [[Karuk]], a Native American language from northwestern California. His study of the language was the first carried out under the auspices of the [[Survey of California and Other Indian Languages]].&lt;ref name="shipley1988"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shipley | first = William | title = In Honor of Mary Haas | publisher = Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co | location = City | year = 1988 | isbn = 3-11-011165-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was made an honorary member of the Karuk tribe—the first outsider to be so honored—in recognition of his efforts to [[Language documentation|document]] and preserve their language which led to its revival.  Bright was also known for his research on the Native American languages [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], [[Kaqchikel language|Kaqchikel]], [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]], [[Ute Tribe|Ute]], [[Chinookan languages|Wishram]], and [[Yurok language|Yurok]], and the South Asian languages [[Mizo language|Lushai]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Tulu language|Tulu]].  Of particular note are his toponymic contributions to knowledge about place names and their linguistic importance for tribes and California bands.

Bright was editor of ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', the journal of the [[Linguistic Society of America]], from 1966 to 1988 and of ''[[Language in Society]]'' from 1993 to 1999. He was the founding editor of ''[[Written Language and Literacy]]'', which he edited from 1997 until 2003. He served as president of the Linguistic Society of America in 1989.

He was the father of author [[Susie Bright]]. In the last twenty years of his life, he was married to [[Lise Menn]]. He died of a brain tumor.
